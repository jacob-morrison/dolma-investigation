{'text': 'Voltaire\'s    Candide  \n\n  The strong personal views of Voltaire can easily be found through\n\nhis caricature of characters in his black comedy  Candide  .\n These characters, through their obvious ridiculousness, critique many\n\nbeliefs and poke fun at many people without openly attacking them in much the\n\nsame way Dante did in his  Inferno  .\n is a double-edged criticism:\n\nit mocks the artificial order of fiction, while ridiculing what Voltaire sees\n\nas the equally artificial order of philosophical optimism. \n\n  The first of these two criticisms, that of fiction in general,\n\nbecomes evident immediately and gains power as the plot unfolds and grows\n\nmore fantastic.\n Voltaire parodies the seemingly " coincidental" occurrences that\n\nconveniently make up most fiction by making these coincidences so absurd that\n\nthey become simply ludicrous.\n Examples of this within the text are numerous: Cunegonde and her\n\nbrother are supposedly dead, but appear at opportune times ( Cunegonde in\n\ntime to see Candide flogged and to save him afterwards, her brother in time\n\nto gain favour with the Jesuits).\n Her brother is supposedly killed again, this time by Candide himself,\n\nbut even this is not permanent as he once again comes to life in time to\n\nforgive Candide and come to his aid once again.\n syphilis and his\n\nseemingly permanent condition of having been hanged; the equally miraculous\n\nhealing of Candide\'s back after being flogged within an inch of his life not\n\nonce, but twice; the incredible story of the old woman whose traumatic\n\nexperiences seem to continue endlessly - - all of these events occur one\n\nafter another, and though they are considered fortunate by the characters,\n\nthey are still seen as possible.\n The occurrence of all these events in the same story, and the\n\nattitude the characters take towards them together make it impossible to view\n\nthe book as anything but a mockery of fiction itself. \n\n  Another aspect of the story that implies a parody of standard\n\nfiction is the division of the book, and Candide\'s adventure, into three\n\nsymmetrical parts of ten chapters each.\n Candide\'s adventures in Europe are neatly fit into the first ten\n\nchapters, at which point he goes to sea to spend the next ten chapters in\n\nSouth America.\n After the completion his adventures there, the story returns to\n\nEurope for the final ten chapters while Candide searches for Cunegonde, a\n\nsearch which is finally resolved and neatly concluded in chapter thirty.\n This even division of the story is yet another parody of neatly\n\nordered fiction which often seems to peak, trough and resolve conflicts at\n\njust the right times. \n\n  is\n\nof the philosophical optimism which was peaking in popularity at the time of\n\nits writing.\n It is in this criticism that we see Voltaire\'s personal philosophical\n\nviews reflected in the novel.\n By abusing the optimistic philosophy and taking it to an extreme\n\nthrough the character of Pangloss, he ridicules and tries to discredit those\n\nphilosophers who preached it.\n But to understand the extreme Voltaire was taking this philosophy to,\n\nwe must first examine what it was he was trying to discredit. \n\n  A major proponent of the philosophical optimism Voltaire\n\ndisagreed with was Alexander Pope, and he expressed his views in question in\n\nhis  Essay on Man  .\n Pope\'s strongest assertion is best summed up in the last line of his\n\nfirst epistle, where he writes that  " One thing is clear, WHATEVER\n\nIS, IS RIGHT."  \n By this he does not mean that there is no evil in the world, but this\n\nevil is necessary for the general good, so that man may choose between good\n\nand evil. \n\n\n  Gottfried   Leibnitz, who stated that \n\n" man and all nature is subject to law, order and uniformity."  \n It is this order that Voltaire attacks with scathing satire, and in\n\nparticular Leibnitz\'s belief that  " this world ... is the best\n\npossible world, but it is not perfect,"   which\n\nVoltaire distorts into  formula that  " Everything\n\nis for the best in this best of all possible worlds."  \n\n  One can now easily see the parallel and hear the mocking tone in\n\nhis writing when Voltaire describes  philosophy as  "\n\nmetaphysico-theologico-cosmo-loonig-ology,"  and when he explains it\n\nas thus:  ... that there cannot possibly be an effect without a cause\n\nand that in this best of all possible worlds the Baron\'s castle was the best\n\nof all castles and his wife the best of all possible Baronesses ... \n It is clear, said he, that things cannot be otherwise than they are,\n\nfor since everything is made to serve an end, and everything necessarily\n\nserves the best end.   \n Pangloss then continues to abuse this last philosophy by suggesting\n\nthat noses were made to support spectacles and stones to build castles.\n support of his exaggerated philosophy under\n\nthe unbelievable circumstances in the story that makes it seem as ludicrous\n\nas Voltaire intended it to.\n An example of this is his defense of the philosophy after he had been\n\ndisfigured by syphilis.\n " It\n\nwas all indispensable ... since private misfortunes make for public welfare,\n\nand therefore the more private misfortunes there are, the better everything\n\nis."  <fnr> 6/ <fnr> \n\n  In addition to this constant parody, Voltaire finds many\n\nopportunities to fit personal insults and jokes into the novel.\n Only one of this is a mockery of the real situation that happened to\n\na man named Wolff, a disciple of Leibnitz\'s.\n Wolff\'s theory of pre-established harmony in reality prompted several\n\nmen to desert from the army, surely the basis for the experience Candide\n\nhimself has when he simply wanders off while serving in the Bulgar army.\n Thus in the episode, we can see Voltaire making fun of both the\n\nphilosophy and of Wolff himself, who had been expelled from the country\n\nbecause of the scandal. \n\n  After examining these examples and the myriad others throughout\n\nthe story, it should be obvious to any reader now where much of Voltaire\'s\n\ndrive for writing  Candide  stemmed from - - from his concept for\n\nfalse order; both the order of fiction and the order of the optimistic\n\nphilosophy of men such as Leibnitz.\n However, his sense of man\'s need for this order is not entirely lost.\n It is perhaps best described in the introduction to the book in the\n\n Norton Anthology  how  " one can feel his amused awareness\n\nof our human need to make order and our human desire to comfort ourselves by\n\nfictions."  \n But for him, this is no excuse.\n Candide\n\n is  " That we human beings have reason ... is no ground on which\n\nto flatter ourselves; rightly used, it exposes our insufficiencies."\n\n   \n\n\n THE APPRENTICESHIP\n\nOF DUDDY KRAVITZ  &  THE GREAT GATSBY  \n\n  The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz\n\n and F. Scott Fitzgerald\'s  The Great Gatsby  , the theme\n\nregarding the destructive nature of society\'s obsession with materialism\n\nemerges.\n Fitzgerald and Richler offer a satirical view of materialism and how\n\nit corrupts society.\n , Duddy\n\nclimbs the ladder to material success, and it is apparent that along the way\n\nhumanistic values are lost.\n , the protagonist, Jay Gatsby, is\n\nportrayed as a man with great status because of his exorbitant wealth.\n unfolds so do\n\nhis shortcomings.\n Both novels portray the insistent material urgings of society and the\n\nvictory marked by the elimination of human values. \n\n  offers an insight\n\ninto a young man\'s quest for material success.\n Since he was a young boy Duddy was conditioned by his grandfather to\n\nbelieve that:  " A man without land is nobody"  ( Richler pg.\n\n11).\n This conversation between Duddy and his grandfather, marks the\n\nbeginning of Duddy\'s transition into a materialistic world.\n Duddy\'s search for his identity becomes concentrated in getting\n\nrather than being, as he believes the self is to be found in external things.\n\n\n\n  Duddy becomes so obsessed with his pursuit for success, that he\n\nloses sight of all other dimensions of life:  " You think I should be\n\nrunning after something besides money?  Good tell me what"   (\n\npg.244).\n\n\n  also examines a young man\'s quest for\n\nmaterial success.\n Like Duddy, Gatsby believes that one\'s happiness and success is found\n\nin the acquisition of material possessions.\n When Jimmy Gatz met Daisy he came face to face with everything he\n\never dreamed of possessing.\n She was wealth, power, and beauty.\n From childhood Jimmy Gatz, maker of schedules and reader of Hopalong\n\nCassidy, venerated Jay Gatsby, a promise of unlimited opportunities in a\n\nmaterialistic world.\n Gatsby saw money as the creator of possibility and passage to\n\nfreedom.\n Gatsby believed that once he acquired all of his exuberant\n\npossessions, he could have Daisy.\n it was just\n\na matter of the price he would have to pay.\n Gatsby\'s obsession with materialism is demonstrated in the park\n\nincident, where Gatsby, Nick, Daisy, and her husband Tom are having a picnic\n\ntogether, and Gatsby takes it upon himself to tell Tom about his affair with\n\nDaisy:  " She only married you because I was poor and she was tired of\n\nwaiting for me"  ( pg. 131).\n Gatsby truly believes that the only way to get what you want out of\n\nlife is to have money, which will provide the power. \n\n  The Apprenticeship\n\nof Duddy Kravitz  through the protagonist Duddy, and his treatment of\n\npeople around him.\n He turns to his family and friends, not for companionship or love,\n\nbut for tools to help him get what he wants.\n Duddy\'s lack of sensitivity towards his family is evident of his lack\n\nof respect towards his Uncle Benji\'s house.\n Benji wills his house and possessions to Duddy when he passes away,\n\nhoping to give Duddy a chance to find the compassion he is capable of\n\nfeeling.\n But his attempt failed, as Duddy\'s response was to sell the houseful\n\nof furniture that Benji left.\n Duddy\'s lack of compassion is further represented in his\n\nrelationships with Yvette and Virgil.\n After making love to Yvette for the first time by the lake, Duddy is\n\novercome with excitement, not over Yvette, but the land he has just\n\ndiscovered around the lake.\n He uses Yvette as an instrument to acquire all the land he wants.\n Duddy\'s incapacity to feel compassion is also revealed in his\n\nexploitation of Virgil.\n He swindles money from Virgil that he owed on the pinball machines;\n\nHe hires Virgil as a driver, knowing he is an epileptic, and is consequently\n\nresponsible for Virgil\'s paralyzing accident.\n Duddy\'s insensitivities peak when he steals money from Virgil\'s bank\n\naccount.\n Duddy won\'t stop at anything to get the land he wants, as he is\n\nincapable of distinguishing between material things and human qualities.\n At the end it is Simcha, Duddy\'s grandfather, who recognizes the\n\nhuman failure contained in the material success:  I can see what you\n\nhave planned for me Duddel. \n You\'ll be good to me.\n You\'d give me everything I wanted.\n\n\n swindle   others.

{'text': 'Since the early part of this century women have gradually gained\n\naccess to compete for better jobs in Canada.\n They have however, been prevented from success in their attempt to\n\nbecome equals in the workplace through systemic discrimination.\n As well as women; native Canadians, visible minorities and persons\n\nwith disabilities have also been subjected to discriminative hiring policies\n\nand practices by a majority of employers in Canada.\n In a society based on the ideals of liberal democracy, this type of\n\nblatant discrimination can not be allowed to continue any longer. \n\n \n\nious groups to have equal opportunity to achieve their full potential in\n\nCanadian places of business, the government must enact laws that will force\n\nemployers to dismantle existing discriminatory hiring policies.\n Employers would also be required to put into place new hiring\n\nprocedures to ensure equality for specific groups within society who are\n\npresently proportionately under represented in certain fields of work.\n The necessity for such laws has come about for the main reasons that,\n\nfirst of all, the government policy of allowing businesses to undertake such\n\nprograms voluntarily has failed denying many Canadians equality of\n\nopportunity in the workplace.\n As well/ secondly, it will be shown that the main arguments against\n\naffirmative action are invalid if the proper programs are implemented. \n\n  To fully understand the conflicts between those for and against\n\naffirmative action we must look at the cases put forward by both sides of the\n\ndebate.\n However, before we discuss affirmative action we must define it\n\nas it should be by any government legislation so that it will be both\n\neffective and equitable to everyone concerned. \n\n  Affirmative action must be seen as a policy to ensure equal\n\nopportunity to members of groups, such as women, natives, the disabled and\n\nvisible minorities, who have been subjected to discriminatory hiring policies\n\nin the past.\n This policy would also be implemented without penalizing equally\n\nqualified white males who have been the beneficiaries of past hiring\n\npolicies.\n Whether or not these policies have intentionally been set up to act\n\nas barriers is of little consequence and will therefore not be discussed\n\nbeyond this point.\n Equality for white males as well as the " quota system" of\n\naffirmative action will be elaborated on later.\n Presently we will turn our attention to the case against affirmative\n\naction. \n\n  The strongest argument to be a made by those opposed to\n\naffirmative action is that; if quota systems are implemented many qualified\n\napplicants will have to be overlooked while many unqualified applicants\n\nwill be given a job just because of their sex, race, ethnic background or\n\ndisability.\n This is a valid argument as can be seen by simply looking at the\n\nexample of this exact problem occurring at Harvard Medical School.\n Since 1968 the administration of the Harvard Medical School has\n\nreserved twenty percent of first year admissions for what they classify as "\n\nmembers of disadvantaged minority groups" ( Roberts p. 219).\n In a study of the qualifications of students who were admitted to the\n\nmedical program because of this quota system, it was noted that " for them,\n\nthe usual requirements of high grades and MCAT scores were greatly relaxed" (\n\nHavender in Roberts p.219).\n A similar situation is documented at the University of California\n\nMedical School where, because of the quota system in place, the entrance\n\nmarks of minority group members were " lower than the minimum required for\n\nwhite applicants" ( U.S. News and World Report in Roberts p.219).\n Another closely related argument deals with the possible, if not\n\nlikely, consequences of putting an unqualified person in a position, via the\n\nquota system, where they are likely to fail or " perform incompetently".\n The argument follows that, with increased demands on ability many of\n\nthose who achieved a position because they belong to a " minority group" will\n\nnot be able to meet the standards required of them ( Van den Haag in Roberts\n\np.219).\n In addition, some argue that this failure will cause considerable\n\ndamage to the person\'s self-esteem.\n Another argument put forward by critics of affirmative action is that\n\nit causes problems between those groups who do not benefit and those who do;\n\nas well as within the latter group. \n\n  It has been stated that within the groups that should benefit\n\nfrom affirmative action policy, there are some who believe that they have the\n\nright to receive extra benefits " simply because their ancestors were subject\n\nto discriminatory treatment" ( Roberts p.219).\n This in turn has two interesting consequences.\n The first is that these people will not be motivated to acquire the\n\nknowledge or skills that they do need to achieve their desired success.\n Secondly, according to L.W. Roberts, is that those who do not benefit\n\nfrom affirmative action will sense that they are still being subjected to\n\ndiscriminatory treatment.\n As a result, those within a target group who do not gain anything\n\nfrom affirmative action policies may resent others of the same group who\n\ndo benefit.\n Another consequence is that there will be those in the group not\n\nmeant to benefit from affirmative action policies, specifically white males,\n\nwho will begrudge those who have been advanced to their position for a reason\n\nother than ability. \n\n  Another challenge put forward against affirmative action is that\n\nit will penalize working class families and benefit mostly middle and upper\n\nclass couples and families.\n Conrad Winn has argued that affirmative action will hurt working\n\nclass families in which the male is the sole income earner because he will\n\nface increased competition from women prospering from new hiring and\n\npromotion policies in all fields of employment.\n It can not be denied that there is a very strong case against the\n\nmandatory implementation of affirmative action policies!\n We will now turn our attention to the case for affirmative action.\n\n\n\n \n\nbution of women, Natives, visible minorities and the disabled across job\n\ncategories, and in their distribution up and down the ranks of the\n\noccupational hierarchy. ( Agocs p. 194) \n\n  The statement above is based on extensive data showing that the\n\ngroups mentioned have in fact, through discriminatory hiring policies, been\n\neffectively kept from performing up to their full potential in Canada.\n The reason for the present situation, it is argued, is the lax\n\ngovernment policy on discrimination in the workplace.\n The following is a summary of affirmative action as it has been in\n\nCanada. \n\n \n\ntively pursue an increase in the number of Natives and francophones in\n\nthe civil service; this was the beginning of affirmative action in\n\nCanada.\n In 1977 the Canadian Human Rights Act became the first piece of\n\nlegislation passed by the federal government in support of its affirmative\n\naction policy.\n As well, since 1979 the Canadian Employment and Immigration\n\nCommission ( CEIC), a part of the Department of Employment and Immigration,\n\nhas tried to convince employers to partake in voluntary affirmative\n\naction plans.\n By June of 1984 over 900 firms had been offered assistance in setting\n\nup an affirmative action program.\n However, of all those approached only sixty-seven of them had\n\nactually signed agreements to voluntarily set up affirmative action programs;\n\nof those sixty-seven only five of them followed through and developed\n\naffirmative action policies!\n Women were the only group covered by all 67 of the agreements.\n Fifty-two of them covered Natives and the disabled but only five\n\ncovered Blacks and other visible minorities ( CEIC in Agocs p.197).\n The main problem facing the CEIC was that the contracts were not\n\nlegally binding and more often than not the firms only agreed to sign them\n\nbecause of ulterior motives ( Agocs p. 197).\n It is obvious that up until this point government policy, with\n\nrespect to affirmative action, has resulted in only disappointment.\n To fully understand the plight of the disadvantaged groups it will be\n\nhelpful to look at some statistics concerning their position in the Canadian\n\nlabour force. \n\n  Women, who make up close to half the work force, earn only 63\n\npercent of what males with similar qualifications earn.\n Native women earn only 40 percent of the wage men do, and half of all\n\ndisabled persons who want to work are unemployed ( Geller 239).\n Supporters of affirmative action contend that laws requiring\n\nemployers to adopt affirmative action policies to advance those groups who\n\nare not now fairly represented is the only way to provide equality of\n\nopportunity in the workplace.\n These laws are necessary to remove systemic barriers for members of\n\nthe groups mentioned previously to have an equal opportunity to be hired and\n\nfor them to be able to rise through the ranks into the hierarchy of firms.\n\n\n\n  Although those opposed to affirmative action have supported their\n\nargument well, there can be no doubt that the time has come for mandatory\n\naffirmative action legislation to be passed. \n\n  A quota system is no good.\n Qualified white, males will be losing out to unqualified persons from\n\ntarget groups in areas of the work force where quota systems are in place.\n\n  " such programs ( quota systems) represent the extreme end of the\n\ncontinuum"   ( Roberts p. 218).\n As more women receive post-secondary education the number of women in\n\nthe upper management positions will come to properly present women in the\n\nwork force if certain laws are put into place.\n If both a man and a woman are equally qualified for a job the woman\n\nshould be hired until such time that women and men are represented\n\nproportionately in the work force according to data base  \n\n statistics   . \n\n  We must also take into consideration that Canadian society is\n\nchanging.\n To at least some degree men have previously overwhelmingly\n\noutnumbered women in terms of being better educated and in terms of sheer\n\nnumber of applicants for a desired position.  \n\n\n\n\n  " Kubla Khan", one of Samuel Taylor Coleridge\'s most\n\ncontroversial works, has a shroud of mystery looming over it which is partly\n\ndue to the events leading up to its creation.\n If Coleridge is to be taken literally, then the poem is a fragment of\n\na dream he had as he roughly describes in the preface.\n is not\n\na fragment, and is as complete as Coleridge could make it.\n Consisting of many opium-induced dreamlike visions, Coleridge must\n\nhave taken the time to put together these crazy ideas into their currently\n\npolished state.\n Images relating to sexuality, nature and life itself, yield a brief\n\nglimpse of Coleridge\'s paradise, and show the dangers of viewing such a\n\nparadise. \n\n  " If\n\nColeridge had never published his Preface, who would have thought of " Kubla\n\nKhan" as a fragment?" \n Indeed the legitimacy of the Preface is problematic, for the poet was\n\nforever down-playing his accomplishments, he notoriously plagiarized, and\n\nlikely edited and revised the poem before it was published. \n\n  ( 330),\n\nand never seemed particularly confident about his accomplishments.\n Thus he may have been trying to deflect criticism by describing "\n\nKubla Khan" as a  " psychological curiosity"  ( 353).\n " adapted ( or simply adopted) passages from\n\nother writers, with little or no acknowledgement, and sometimes in a context\n\nthat seems designed to obfuscate his literary motives and to reveal the\n\nsubterfuge"  ( 330).\n While Coleridge likely created " Kubla Khan" himself, his lack of\n\nethics certainly allowed him to alter the " true" story as he saw fit. \n\n  " On awakening he\n\nappeared to himself to have a distinct recollection of the whole, and taking\n\nhis pen, ink and paper, instantly and eagerly wrote down the lines that are\n\nhere preserved"  ( 353).\n Given the rhyme scheme and stanza form, it seems strange that a poem\n\nso well written could be composed while asleep.\n " He lacked\n\napplication and staying power  ( 330), so Coleridge must have worked\n\non the poem. \n The shadows these three doubts cast, seriously weaken the\n\nplausibility of " Kubla Khan" being a fragment half-remembered, and lend\n\ncredence to House\'s claim that  " Coleridge played, out of modesty,\n\nright into the hands of critics"  .', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source':

{'text': 'On July 1st 1990, Canada day, several Canadian rock bands gathered\n\noutside of Barrie Ontario to perform a Canada Day " Celebration".\n The final act of the day was the Box, a band from Québec.\n They tried to make the point that despite the recent failure of the\n\nMeech Lake Accord, we Canadians have to plough onwards.\n The boohs and hisses which erupted were embarrassing.\n Had the failure of the Meech Lake Accord, a proposed constitutional\n\namendment which would symbolically bring Québec into the Constitution\n\nand increase the powers of the provinces, left the country with wounds that\n\nwould not heal? \n\n  This paper will argue that considering the factors which led to\n\nthe failure of the Meech Lake Accord and the attitudes which have developed\n\nsince that failure no accommodations are possible to salvage the existing\n\nCanadian Confederation.\n The factors which led to the failure of Meech left the opposing and\n\nappreciative factions too resolute in their stances to reach accommodation.\n Also important in analyzing the elements which lead to the failure of\n\nMeech was that Meech was a <b> Constitutional </b> amendment and therefore\n\ndebate about it was tainted by ideological symbolism.\n The wounds incurred to Canadian pan-nationalism by Meech were not new\n\nones; rather they were old wounds reopened.\n The feelings which were cultivated in both Québec and English\n\nCanada during the separatist movement and the language policy debates of the\n\n1960s and 1970s, by the \' 82 Constitution Act, reached a boiling point with\n\nthe June 23rd failure of Meech.\n These extreme feelings will not be swept under the carpet by either\n\nside in the conflict.\n So intense was this boiling point that both pro and anti Meech\n\nexponents will remain adamant in their demands; stalemate. \n\n  The factors which led to the failure of Meech ranged from the\n\ntraditional English-French relations debate to dislike for the actual\n\nprovisions of the accord. \n\n  In any negotiations for concessions it becomes extremely\n\ndifficult to achieve agreement when one group enters the negotiations with\n\ninflexible demands.\n Such was the case with Québec\'s position regarding their\n\nsymbolic entrance into the Constitution.\n Québec made it clear in 1986 what their requirements were for\n\nthem to become a member of the Constitution.\n Gil Rémillard, then Québec Minister of Intergovernment\n\nAffairs, laid down their demands as follows: ( 1) explicit recognition of\n\nQuébec as a distinct society; ( 2) the recognition of a right to\n\nconstitutional veto; ( 3) a limitation on the federal spending power; ( 4)\n\nQuébec\'s participation in appointing judges to the Supreme Court; and\n\n( 5) a guarantee of increased powers in matters of immigration. \n Québec felt as if they ( it) were ( was) wronged in 1982 and\n\nthey now had their demands to make up for that wrong and they were not going\n\nto relinquish them.\n did\n\nsomewhat have Québec lean into the blow in \' 82.\n During the separatist campaign of 1980 the federal government told\n\nthe people of Québec that if they said no to separation then the\n\nfederal government would negotiate a constitution.\n When such a constitution was prepared it was incompatible to the\n\nneeds of Québec.\n\n\ngovernment   was very adamant in the provision that they felt were\n\nnecessary to forget the sucker punch of \' 82. \n\n  Many Canadians felt that the proposals within Meech Lake were too\n\ndecentralizing and that the amendment would destroy a pan-Canada which ranged\n\nfrom sea to sea.\n " pan-Canadianism, support for the\n\nCharter, belief in a leading role for the central government, and a deep\n\nuneasiness at the provincializing thrust of the Accord were generously\n\nrepresented, indeed probably dominant, among the groups and individuals that\n\nappeared before the Joint Committee and in other fora outside of\n\nQuébec,"  . \n To achieve the largely symbolic effect of drawing Québec into\n\nthe Canadian Constitutional family the Accord would reshape federalism to\n\nwhat many believed to perverse levels.\n Many Canadians felt that the catch was not worth the high cost of the\n\nbait. \n\n  The Accord was also objectionable on the grounds of how it was\n\ncreated.\n The future of Canadian federalism and the framework of a nation were\n\nshaped by eleven men behind closed doors.\n origin had two\n\nnegative effects for the Accord.\n The first, as discussed, was a resentment of the decentralizing\n\nproposals for the Country.\n The Premiers had a conflict of interest in that they were men elected\n\nto get results within their provinces, yet they were negotiating the\n\ndistribution of power between the provinces and the central government.\n How could they do anything but want more power with which to take\n\nresults to their voters?\n "\n\nappeared to be a document drawn up by provincial governments for provincial\n\ngovernments, the result of a constitutional contest in which the federal\n\ngovernment was a referee but not a player aggressively pursing its own\n\ninterest and vision"  . \n Increased power for the provinces, decentralization, was a natural\n\nconsequence of ten provincial players and one federal player negotiating\n\nconstitutional reform.\n The second unpopular effect that the origin of Meech produced was the\n\nresentment that certain interest groups felt at not being included in the\n\nnegotiations.\n Donna Grescher maintained that the political battles of the previous\n\nround of the Constitutional reform were  " still too fresh in the\n\nmemories of national women\'s organizations for them not to be suspicious of a\n\ndeal struck in private by eleven men"  . \n Constitutional reform only rears its head every so often and thus\n\ninterest groups are going to push as hard as possible to have their interest\n\nrepresented at any time reform is proposed.\n Furthermore it is important to consider that, as Richard Simeon,\n\nwrote  " the stakes of constitutional politics are high, and high\n\nstakes politics are likely to be ideological politics"  . \n Not only did the Accord offend those who were neglected recognition\n\nbut it also threatened the existing recognition of constitutional groups.\n Cairns considered Meech to be a rebuff for aboriginals, women\'s\n\ngroups, and members of the non-Charter communities. \n " If you\n\nupgrade the rights of the French and do not do the same to the rights of\n\neveryone else, by definition, you have just lowered else\'s"  . \n Opposition from the aboriginal corner on this point would reach fatal\n\nlevels for the Meech Lake Accord. \n\n  Not only did some Canadians deplore the decentralizing aspects of\n\nMeech\'s proposed changes to the amending formula, but it was also feared that\n\nstrengthening the amending formula would weaken the rights of citizens.\n element of the\n\nconstitution while the amending formula maintains the supremacy of the\n\nParliament.\n the\n\ntension between bringing the citizenry into the constitutional order via the\n\nCharter and firmly placing the same citizenry on the sidelines when\n\nconstitutional amendments are undertaken might lie dormant if formal\n\nconstitutional change was only a rare event, ...\n However, Meech promises the reverse with its requirement of annual\n\nconstitutional conference and the concomitant assumption that constitutional\n\nfine tuning is an ever-present requirement ( Cairns 174)   .\n Regardless of any English/French quarrel certain Canadians felt as if\n\nthe proposed changes to the amending formula were threatening to the rights\n\nof Canadians. \n\n  It has been argued that some Meech opponents rejected it not for\n\nits actual provisions, but out of retaliation for old English/French wounds.\n " Clearly, what they ( Québec\n\nAnglophones) found so offensive in the measure ( Bill 101) was its symbolism:\n\nthe denial of full equality between English and French with    Québec   , "  . \n Statistics have revealed that the French language was declining\n\noutside of Québec.\n Yet the rest of Canada watched as Québec passed a Bill which\n\n<b> prohibited </b> certain usage of one language.\n Some Canadians feared that to constitutionally empower a province\n\nthat was already repressing one language to  " preserve and promote"\n\n their language and culture would be like giving a terrorist extra\n\nbullets. \n\n  Not only are the factors which led to the demise of Meech\n\nimportant to the future of the country but also the attitudes which have\n\ndeveloped since then. \n\n  Considering the failure of the Meech Lake Accord the existing\n\nperception in Québec cannot be anything but one of acrimony.\n Québecers cannot help but feel that in a decade of\n\nconstitutional politics they have been slapped in the face twice.\n It has already been explained how the 1982 constitution was a blow to\n\nQuébec.\n Once again, with the failure of Meech, Québec leaned into the\n\nblow.\n In 1986 Québec laid down the conditions which had to be met\n\nfor Québec to enter into the Canadian Constitution.\n One year later these demands were met and the Meech Lake Accord was\n\nsigned.\n All seemed well.\n Then three years later the Accord was rejected.\n Québec had been teased into expecting a kiss and instead\n\nreceived a slap.\n Québec dug in their heels as a result of the egg on their\n\nfaces.\n The obvious product of their tenacity will be a refusal to demand\n\nanything less than what they demanded in \' 86. \n\n  Quite diametrically opposed to the tenacious stance of\n\nQuébec was the position of many Canadians that any future agreements\n\nwould have to be less decentralizing.\n " Indeed, one of the srongest reactions against Meech Lake\n\ncomes from Canadians who felt that their national government and national\n\ncommunity were weakened"  , wrote Cairns. \n Unfortunately Meech opponents seemed as uncompromising in their\n\nprotection of the existing federalist distribution of power. \n\n  As unfortunate as it may be, the Québec people were prey\n\nto a fundamental misconception about the failure of the Accord.\n Many Québec armchair political analysts felt that the rest of\n\nCanada rejected them, not the Accord itself.\n " the stakes of constitutional politics\n\nare high, and high stakes politics are likely to be ideological politics"\n\n . \n It is unfortunate that Quebecers felt rejected for the wrong reasons\n\nconsidering the  " high stakes"  involved. \n\n  Another unfortunate, yet significant, misunderstanding was\n\ndeveloped by the Meech opponents.\n As this essay has already shown many Canadians resented the\n\ndecentralizing thrust of the Accord.\n However, many Canadians also felt that Meech was another example of\n\nQuébec asking for too much.\n The misunderstanding lay in the fact that the decentralizing\n\nprovisions of the Accord applied to all provinces, not just Québec.\n\n\n\n  The failure of Meech also heightened the problem of regionalism.\n The resultant talk of Québec separation spurned comments of\n\nregional problems from other provinces.\n John Buchannan felt that perhaps he might add to the neurosis of the\n\nCanadian psyche by claiming that his province might just separate too.\n He seemed to feel that he would grace America with the " blessings"\n\nof his province. \n\n  Considering the factors which led to the failure of Meech and the\n\nattitudes which have developed since that failure the die has been\n\nirreversibly cast toward Québec sovereignty. \n\n  There exist two factors which make the failure of Meech a fatal\n\nblow in the age old Québec/English Canada clash.\n " high\n\nstakes/ideological"  politics.\n A Constitution is the fundamental law of a land; a legal blueprint\n\nfor a society.\n Proposed changes to such a blueprint naturally carry the panic that\n\nthe building will be changed.\n People are always skeptical of change and the intensity of that\n\nskepticism is directly related to not just the proposed change but also what\n\nis to be changed.\n Thus, changing a Constitution is an extremely dangerous venture.\n Second to the fatality of the blow is the fact that, for\n\nQuébec, it is unexpected.\n In 1987 Québec was expecting a kiss they thought that they\n\ndeserved.\n Three years later they took a punch on the chin.\n The blow dealt to the psyche of Québec by the failure of Meech\n\ncame from a strong hand as Meech was a proposed change to the Constitution;\n\nthe intensity of the blow was heightened as it was unexpected. \n\n  The failure of Meech will bring Québec to the canvass;\n\nQuébec will seek sovereignty.\n However, the factors which led to that failure and the attitudes\n\nwhich developed since then discouraged Québec from seeking a rematch.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '49944f15-4308-4087-b089-1c57375587f8', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.685401+00:00',

{'text': 'Harmony, goodness, charity, holiness, fervour, peace: all feelings\n\none imagines were shared by the passengers on Noah\'s ark.\n , however,\n\nthese emotions are replaced by a dark vision of human relationships with\n\nanimals and male relationships with females.\n While the animals rarely encountered humans before the Flood, they\n\ncame to fear and resent them on the ark, so that the relationship between the\n\nspecies became far more distant.\n The women\'s continually escalating agonies at the hands of Noah and\n\nthe men had a similarly alienating effect.\n Thanks to Noah, then, relationships in the new world will be in many\n\nsenses worse than their pre-Flood counterparts. \n\n  Setting is important in evaluating pre-Flood life.\n For the animals, the wood was a harbour where few humans ventured.\n The only threats came from other animals, but even then, the wood\n\noffered sanctuaries for all, so that some parts  " were holy - other\n\nparts were treacherous"  ( 43), and all of the animals knew which was\n\nwhich.\n Joining the animals in hoarding a shelter were the women who lived on\n\nthe Hill.\n For Hannah it was the orchard, for Emma it was her sudden unexplained\n\ndisappearances, and for Mrs. Noyes, her beloved porch. \n\n  Strong similarities connected the wood and Mrs. Noyes\'s porch.\n When the Flood began, for example, the animals flocked to the wood\n\n " as if the trees - - and the trees alone - - were salvation"\n\n ( 145), while Mrs. Noyoes later returned to the shelter of her\n\nporch, her  " sanctuary"  ( 17), with Lotte\'s murdered corpse.\n Yet even before the Flood, the animals and Mrs. Noyes frequently\n\nsought shelter from the turmoil and horrors of everyday life.\n They would watch each other and generally respected each other ( as\n\nwhen Mrs. Noyes studies nature before Yaweh\'s visit, concluding after a\n\nseries of odd animal behavior that  " somehow, the order of things had\n\nbecome unhinged"  ( 24), but there was rarely close interaction\n\nbetween species.\n\n\n  For creatures living around Noah\'s Hill, one of the most frequent\n\nthreats existed in the form of Noah himself.\n He terrorized the animals, particularly Mottyl and the sheep; Mottyl,\n\nfor example, feared having kittens, for after every new litter, he would\n\nsteal one or two.\n " \'Another experiment: excuse me and thank you ...\' he would\n\nsay, reaching into Mottyl\'s nest and removing one of her kittens"  (\n\n19).\n " the doctor\'s lethal\n\nattentions"  ( 18); Mottyl herself had been blinded in one eye thanks\n\nto Noah\'s experiments. \n\n  If it wasn\'t experiments, there was the constant threats of being\n\n" honoured" as the victim of a sacrifice to Yaweh.\n To Mrs. Noyes\'s horror, the lambs selected were often the very\n\nanimals that she had taught to sing the praises of God.\n Few can overlook the irony of the innocent lamb, happily singing\n\nGod\'s praises as it had been taught by humans, only to have its throat slit\n\nfor God\'s greater glory. \n\n  Noah exhibited a similarly uncaring attitude towards the women on\n\nthe Hill.\n An early comment by the narrator established Noah\'s attitude towards\n\nwomen, for when Mrs. Noyes lets slip the expression  " for God\'s sake"\n\n , Noah became upset, and we are told that  This sort of rage\n\n- - more performance than a reality - - was necessary to keep Mrs. Noyes in\n\nher place. \n Also to intimidate the other women, lest they follow her example and\n\nget out of hand. [ ...]\n (\n\n13)\n\n  Controlling the women took many forms.\n Emma\'s short eleven-year life, for example, had been spent shackled\n\nto the kitchens and scullery  " except that portion having to do with\n\nhiding bloodied underskirts and avoiding bouncing beds"  ( 15).\n Mrs. Noyes\'s harsh description of civilization revealed the depths of\n\nher own enslavement:  Using knives and spoons and plates in the proper\n\norder - putting up one\'s hair and wearing caps and scarves and veils to cover\n\nthis and that and the other so the gentleman wouldn\'t be corrupted and having\n\nit all torn away whenever your husband felt like taking his pleasure. \n The oppression of time - the daily ritual of violence - all that\n\nblood and wine - and the dreariness of protocols; having to ask permission to\n\nspeak and touch and move.  \n To state that male-female relations were unequal would be to run the\n\nrisk of vast understatement, for the women had few rights and no freedom.\n Instead, they were expected to cater to their man\'s every whim, and\n\nNoah was never shy to exploit his advantage. \n\n  No reader expects Noah to be so callous.\n How could Noah, the man singled out by God as the only human worthy\n\nof His blessing, how could such a man casually strike his wife or kill an\n\nanimal?\n The answer may lie in the Bible itself, where Genesis states that\n\n God said, " Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, and let\n\nthem rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the\n\nlivestock, over all the earth, and over all the creatures that move along the\n\nground." \n Man was not an equal: man was superior.\n As far as Yaweh was concerned, Dr. Noyes was completely justified in\n\nhis treatment of both animals and women.\n " in\n\nall Yaweh\'s retinue ... there was not a single female angel - not a single\n\nfemale presence"  ( 71), and he ignored all the women save Hannah,\n\nwith whom his intentions, the reader suspects, may not have been entirely\n\nplatonic. \n\n  Once aboard the ark, Noah\'s behaviour became even more haughty.\n The massacre of friendly sea creatures: the brutal and grotesque\n\nmurder of Unicorn to speed Emma\'s sexual relations with Japeth; the death and\n\nsacrifice of Mottyl\'s kitten; the perpetual darkness and stale air; the lack\n\nof food and water; all of these fought to establish Noah\'s complete\n\nsuperiority of those below, backed by the Bible and Yaweh himself. \n\n  Symbolically, the creatures who enjoyed God\'s approval - those\n\nwho never contradicted or questioned - found themselves housed above deck,\n\nenjoying fresh air and plentiful food.\n In the dark below languished all the inferior creatures - the\n\nanimals, the disrespectful women, and Ham - in what was described as  "\n\nabsolute hell"  ( 250).\n Such a reference to the hell is not a coincidence, for the ark\'s very\n\nstructure reflects the Biblical conception of post-death levels of holiness,\n\nwhere sinners are subjected to tortures deep within the earth while the holy\n\nrejoice high above in heaven.\n Passengers on the ark have been privy to the death of a world: now\n\nthey have been divided in a system of reward and punishment.\n The devil\'s presence below re-enforces this metaphorical structure.\n\n\n\n  Before reading the book, such symbolism seems straightforward.\n For the reader, however, the distribution seems patently unfair, as\n\ncreatures found below were the kind and sympathetic of the Hill\'s population,\n\nwhile those lounging above were the most evil.\n A reversal of the natural order had transpired.\n The demons, for example, were happy to help in an escape attempt,\n\nbecoming martyrs to the cause, while the devil himself played a key role in\n\nboosting morale, arranging for the light and masterminding escape plans for\n\nthe good of all. \n\n  Further, the relationship between human and beast below decks can\n\nbe described as almost ideal.\n Working together to rise against a common oppressor drew the animals\n\nand those below deck closer together, so that Mrs. Noyes was prompted to cry\n\nout  " Oh - everyone! [ ...] \n\n\n( 230).\n Comforts were exchanged and fear was relinquished on all sides, from\n\nthe elephant that lifted Mottyl up with his trunk to the bears that allowed\n\nMrs. Noyes to soothe them in their cage.\n\n\nthere was nonetheless some comfort here in the lamplight, all of them warm\n\ntogether, nesting and being rocked together ... a comfort that was not like\n\nany other.  ( 250) \n\n  Is Findley stating that such a close relationship between animals\n\nand humans is a utopian goal?\n In an unnatural setting such as the ark it seemed to work quite well.\n In the natural setting of the pre-Flood world, however, the results\n\nwere far less positive. \n\n  Biologically speaking, the ape-children were a bridge between\n\nhumans and animals, for they were born of human parents.\n They were the missing link.\n Odds were that they would therefore be best suited to unite humans\n\nand animals.\n When we consider the fact that God has said that man is to rule over\n\nall animals, such a child surely causes Noah painful questionings about God\'s\n\npurpose, especially when we consider the fact that in two of the cases (\n\nHannah\'s child and Adam), the children were apparently conceived by Noah\n\nhimself.\n Noah, the most superior of a superior race, ironically sires subhuman\n\nchildren.\n Religiously, this would have been unacceptable to him, for such an\n\nanimal-human bridge could not exist; was the child animal or human?\n Was it inferior or not?\n\n\n  At any rate, the children were accepted neither by humans nor by\n\nanimals.\n Granted Mrs. Noyes experienced deep regret at having allowed her\n\nape-son Adam to be killed, and she did try to save Lotte, but without Mrs.\n\nNoyes, how well would Lotte have existed in the post-Flood world?\n Her parents seem to have denied her all contact with the natural\n\nworld; instead of allowing Lotte to seek shelter in the woods when other\n\nhumans were coming, Lotte\'s parents would closet her away in the bath house.\n Nor do we hear any mention of such children from Mottyl or, for that\n\nmatter, from anyone else in the wood.\n Given the detail of Mottyl\'s descriptions of the wood, such a failure\n\nwould have been a glaring oversight.\n Clearly the animals either ostracized Lotte for being too much like\n\nhumans ( and as such, untrustworthy) or they were simply not aware of the\n\nexistence of such creatures. \n\n  For their part, the humans were generally repulsed and horrified\n\nby the idea of an ape-child.\n " But - she\'s wearing a\n\ndress"  when she saw Lotte, and moments later her wondering  "\n\nI never thought they could be so loveable"  ( 168) served to\n\nunderline the fact that the ape-children were not considered human.\n Hannah screamed with horror at the sight of her own still-born\n\nape-child, and the modern reader would undoubtably do the same were the\n\npositions reversed.\n Despite the acceptance of Mrs. Noyes and Emma, most humans, and, it\n\nwould seem, no animals are prepared to accept a creature that would bridge\n\nthe gap between animal and human as the ape-children would. \n\n  The devil also switched species, with equally limited success.\n\n\n , he was never able to integrate with the other animals in the forest,\n\nwho sensed that all is not as it should be.\n (\n\n45) Bip the lemur commented, and he later predicted the presence of a rogue\n\nangel.\n As the woman Lucy, the devil was a bit more successful, fooling Ham\n\ninto marriage, but the humans were highly suspicious, and the guise of a\n\nseven foot woman with webbed hands and feet does little to assuage this\n\ndoubt. \n\n  Fundamental differences must clearly be maintained between humans\n\nand animals, as the integrational failure of intermediary characters shows.\n Yaweh and the Bible were correct in stating that the species should\n\nnot interact on an equal plain.\n Before the ark, natural relations were distant; in the ark\'s\n\nunnatural setting, they grow closer, but only because of the very oddity of\n\nthat setting.\n It is just as odd for the animals and humans to act in complete and\n\nequal partnership as it is for the fish to rise out of the pond and walk into\n\nthe wood, as they did early in the novel ( 22).\n Both acts are due to the strange context in which they take place.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '58c71b26-a185-4e2b-aae8-baa0c0429cae', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.686589+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9825886487960815, 'non_english_score': 0.017411351203918457}
{'text': 'By January of 1945 the government of the United States arrived at\n\nthe decision to conduct international trials, referring to the war\n\ncrimes and that were committed by the Germans during the second world\n\nwar.\n The three other Allied powers, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and\n\nFrance accepted the decision by the Americans.\n These trials came to be known as the Nuremberg Trials, which opened on\n\nNovember 20, 1945.\n A representative from each of the Allied countries signed an\n\nAgreement of seven articles which made up the International Military\n\nTribunal. \n The trial was conducted in four languages simultaneously, and every\n\nseat in the court had a pair of headphones attached to it in which the\n\ntrial could be heard in English, Russian, French or German. \n The defendants who were brought to court were those whose crimes fell\n\nwithin three categories: crimes against peace; war crimes; and crimes against\n\nhumanity. \n Twenty-two defendants were indicted, the court conducted 403 open\n\nsessions, throughout the trial 113 witnesses were called, and one hundred\n\nthousand documents were accepted by the court. \n At Nuremberg, seven organizations were declared criminal: the\n\nLeadership Corps of the Nazi Party; the SS, an elite corps under Himmler; the\n\nSD, a Security Service; the SA, a paramilitary organization; the Gestapo, the\n\nsecret state police; the Reich Cabinet, and the General Staff and High Com\n\n<l> mand of the German Armed Forces. \n The trials at Nuremberg aroused many different feelings, but it\n\nwas felt that the German people and organizations responsible for\n\nenslavement, genocide, initiating war, and other atrocities should be brought\n\nto justice. \n\n  The War Crimes committed by the Germans were not spontaneous\n\nevents, some were planned at the highest level and carefully thought out in\n\nadvance.\n Article 6 ( b) of the Charter defines war crimes in these words:\n\n \n " War Crimes: namely, violations of the laws or customs of war.\n Such violations shall include, but not be limited to, murder,\n\nill-treatment or deportation to slave labor or for any other purpose of\n\ncivilian population of or in occupied territory, murder or ill-treatment of\n\nprisoners of war or persons on the seas, killing of hostages, plunder of\n\npublic or private property, wanton destruction of cities, towns, or\n\nvillages, or devastation not justified by military necessity. \n\n \n\n  During the Second World War the treatment towards the prisoners\n\nof war by the Germans was harsh and cruel.\n Allied soldiers who had surrendered to the Germans were shot immedi\n\n<l> ately, commando troops were also killed on the spot, and those who were\n\nexecuted in concentration camps at a later date were obviously never given a\n\ntrial of any sort. \n The treatment towards Soviet prisoners of war was particularly\n\ninhumane.\n They were left without proper clothing; the wounded were given no\n\nmedical care; they were starved, and many were simply left to die. \n Soviet prisoners in some cases were branded with a special permanent\n\nmark, and were also used for medical experiments.  \n\n  The use of concentration camps was widespread during the war.\n The concentration camps were places where people were subject to\n\nbrutality.\n For those who did not die during the trip to the camps were given\n\nhard physical labor, inadequate food, clothes, and shelter.\n Some concentration camps were equipped with gas chambers, for the\n\npurpose of destroying the inmates and furnaces for burning the dead bodies.\n Some of the these were used for the extermination of Jews as a part\n\nof the " final solution" to the Jewish problem. \n There were plans to get rid of whole native populations in Poland and\n\nthe Soviet Union, and Hitler wrote in " Mein Kampf":  " It is not our\n\ntask to Germanize the east in the old sense, that is to teach the people\n\nthere the German language and the German law, but to see to it that only\n\npeople of purely Germanic blood live in the east."   \n\n  Private property in many occupied countries was invaded upon in\n\nwhich private collections and libraries were robbed, and private houses were\n\nseized. \n Another crime included the slave-labor programme, where at least five\n\nmillion men and women were taken from their homes and sent to work in German\n\nfactories or on farms. \n The camps in which they were placed were unsanitary, the food was\n\nscarce, and even a portion of their pay was taken.  \n\n  The liquidation of the Jews from German life was a policy that\n\nhad been established by the Germans by 1938.\n The Jews were originally forced to live in ghettoes, to wear a yellow\n\nstar on the breast and back, and were used as slave laborers.\n But the plans for the " final solution" of the Jewish question meant\n\nthe extermination of all Jews. \n As a part of the " final solution" all Jews from German occupied\n\nEurope were placed in concentration camps.\n All who were fit to work were used as slave laborers, and those\n\nwho were not fit to work were killed in gas chambers and then their bodies\n\nwere burnt.\n The Jews as well as the Soviets were used in medical experiments such\n\nas determining how long human beings could survive in freezing water.\n\n\n It has been estimated that this policy resulted in the killing of six\n\nmillion Jews.  \n\n  Crimes against Humanity often overlapped War Crimes, and Article\n\n6 of the Charter states:   " Crimes against humanity: namely,\n\nmurder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts com\n\n<l> mitted against any civilian population, before or during the war; or\n\npersecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in\n\nconnection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or\n\nnot in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated." \n\n  \n\n  The persecution of the Jews, and murdering civilians who were\n\nthought to hold opposing views against the German government, were\n\ncrimes carried out on a vast scale and were considered crimes against\n\nhumanity.\n Crimes against humanity were committed as a result of racial or\n\nreligious persecutions.  \n\n  The Chief Prosecutors of the Nuremberg Trials decided on\n\ntwenty-four individuals who were thought to be the most guilty of the\n\nsurviving leaders. \n But only twenty-two of these men were actually tried because one\n\ncommitted suicide in prison and one was too ill to stand his trial.\n Each of the defendants was represented by one or more German counsel.\n And when it was time to deal with the evidence against the\n\ndefendants, it was to be remembered that no man could be punished for an act\n\nunless both the act and its penalty had been defined in writing before the\n\ndate of the act. \n To give an idea of what the accused individuals were involved\n\nwith, I will talk about four men, namely Goering, Hess, Von Ribbentrop\n\nand Keitel. \n\n  Goering, after Hitler, was the most potent man in the Nazi\n\nregime.\n He was the advisor, the active agent of Hitler, and one of the main\n\nleaders of the Nazi movement.\n Not only did he establish the Gestapo, he created the first concentra\n\n<l> tion camps. \n Besides Hitler, he was the moving force for aggressive war, and\n\nwas deeply involved in the planning and maneuvering the military in\n\npreparation for war.\n Goering admitted to the accusations stated against him above,\n\nincluding leading the slave-labor program and persecuting the Jews.\n With all of the evidence piled against him he was found guilty on all\n\nfour counts of the indictment, and was sentenced to death by hanging.\n\n \n\n  position as Deputy to the Fuehrer included being\n\nthe top man in the Nazi Party with the responsibility for handling all\n\nparty matters. \n He was an active supporter of preparations for war, and he\n\nblamed England and France for the war.\n Hess was a willing participant in German aggression against Austria,\n\nCzechoslovakia, and Poland.\n When the trials were underway there was some discrepancy about\n\nwhether he was mentally stable enough to stand trial and defend himself,\n\nand due to this factor he was represented by counsel, and was found guilty on\n\ncounts one and two, and was sentenced to life in prison.  \n\n  In 1932 Von Ribbentrop joined the Nazi Party, and by 1933 he was\n\nForeign Policy Adviser to Hitler. \n Von Ribbentrop was involved in areas such as participating in the\n\nplans to attack Czechoslovakia, he played an important role in the act <l>\n\nivities which led up to the attack on Poland, and he urged Japan to invade\n\nthe Soviet Union. \n He is responsible for war crimes against humanity due to his\n\ninvolvement in the extermination of Jews.\n The Tribunal found Von Ribbentrop guilty on all four counts and was\n\nsentenced to death.  \n\n  On the day that Hitler took control of the armed forces he made\n\nKeitel Chief of the High Command of the Armed Forces.\n His war crimes included activities such as ordering that for every\n\nGerman soldier that was killed, fifty to a hundred Communists should be\n\nput to death. \n He felt that civilians suspected of any violations against\n\nGerman troops should be shot without trial, and that no trials were necessary\n\nfor the German violations against the civilians.\n\n Keitel admitted to these acts and was found guilty on all four\n\ncounts, and like Von Ribbentrop and Goering, was sentenced to death. \n\n  Not only were certain individuals brought to trial, but\n\norganizations who had committed crimes were brought forward as well.\n Therefore, a person who was a member of an organization which\n\nwas declared to be criminal was liable to be convicted of the crime of\n\nmembership and be punished. \n But, all members of an organization who left there positions before\n\nSeptember first, 1939 were not liable to be charged with any criminal acts.\n\n\n It was suspected that more than half a million people were involved\n\nin the Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party alone, each of who played a key\n\npart in the Nazi party. \n The seven organizations that were declared criminal were: The Lead\n\n<l> ership Corps of the Nazi Party; the Gestapo; the S.D.; the S.S.; the\n\nS.A.; the Reich Cabinet, and the General Staff and High Command of the German\n\nArmed Forces.  \n\n  The Leadership Corps of the Nazi Party was headed by Hitler as\n\nFuehrer, but the Party was actually run by Hess, the Chief of the Party\n\nChancellery. \n Its primary purpose was to help the Nazis obtain and keep control of\n\nthe German state. \n It was also used for criminal acts such as the persecution of the\n\nJews, the management of the slave labor program, and the mistreatment of the\n\nprisoners of war.  \n\n  The Gestapo and the S.D were prosecuted together because\n\nthey worked so closely together. \n The S.D was used as an intelligence agency, and the Gestapo was made\n\nup of various police forces which were under the leadership of Himmler and\n\nGoering. \n The security police and the S.D. were voluntary organizations,\n\nbut one was unable to pick their choice of assignments or positions.\n\n\n They were used for such activities as persecution and\n\nextermination of Jews, killings in concentration camps and prisoners of war,\n\nand involvement in the slave labor program.  \n\n  The S.S. was originally established by Hitler in 1925, and by the\n\ntime the Nazis had gained power it was used to maintain order and control\n\naudiences at demonstrations. \n By 1939, the S.S. had grown to membership of 240 000 men, and\n\npossessed a legal office and its own legal systems. \n This organization was prosecuted for the extermination of the\n\nJews, mistreatment of the civilian population, managing concentration\n\ncamps, their involvement in the slave labor program and the ill-treatment of\n\nprisoners of war.  \n\n  The S.A was founded in 1921 for political purposes, and until\n\n1939 its membership was completely voluntary. \n\n\nvolved in the Nazi outrages during that time. \n But it was not proved that this organization was part of the plan to\n\nengage in aggressive war, and the Tribunal was unable to charge them with any\n\ncriminal acts under the Charter.  \n\n  The Tribunal did not declare the Reich Cabinet with criminal\n\ncharges for two reasons: 1) it was not proved that after 1937 it acted\n\nas an organization; 2) there were too few people that were liable to be\n\ncharged.  \n It was known that a number of individuals were involved in the\n\nstrategy of aggressive war, but it could not be proven that they worked in a\n\ngroup. \n The General Staff and the High Command was dealt with in the same\n\nmanner as the Reich cabinet.\n The number of persons charged here was greater, but still so small\n\nthat it would be more effective to give each one of them a separate trial.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '389cdfb7-a39a-4ffa-983e-2a2ef922a232', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.687863+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9905927777290344, 'non_english_score': 0.009407222270965576}
{'text': 'Edwardian England came into being with the accession of King\n\nEdward VII on the 22 January 1901.\n For the purpose of this paper the Edwardian era is taken as having\n\nended not with the death of the King in 1910 but with the outbreak of the\n\nFirst World War on 4 August 1914.\n Although this era is often thought to be one of great wealth, promise\n\nand grandeur, hence its referral as  " the Golden era"  this\n\npaper will prove otherwise.\n To disclaim this belief, an examination of the social, economic and\n\npolitical activities of bourgeois women is required. \n\n  Women in Edwardian England had come to feel that they wanted to\n\nclaim a status apart from the traditional feminine role of wife and mother.\n They were going to refuse the appointed labors of washing, cooking,\n\ncleaning and serving.\n In essence they were no longer going to conform to the masculist\n\nstandards and regulations of the era.\n The fact that women were producing fewer children in comparison to\n\nearlier eras,  " the birth rate had fallen from 36.3 per 1000\n\npopulation in the 1870\'s to 28.5 in 1901"  demonstrates their desire\n\nto break free of the reproductive role expected of them ( Read 1972, 21)\n Being less burdened with the duties of pregnancies and domestic\n\naffairs women desired to participate within the political and economic\n\nactivities of the time.\n However their desire to participate within these spheres and their\n\nrefusal to accept the reproductive role constructed for them was not welcomed\n\nby the males in society.\n Men tried to make women feel guilty for betraying their biological\n\nfunction of procreation.\n " natural order"\n\n of things, and they were blamed for the limited numbers of men\n\navailable for military and naval recruitment ( Read 1972, 24.)\n It seems that for the most part, women were not considered as\n\nindependent persons but as integral parts of the family.\n Men desired that these bourgeois women drop their current pursuit and\n\nresume their subservient role of yester-years.\n It was thought that the ideal role for women was to continue being\n\n   nurturing   , emotional, fragile, passive,\n\ncompliant and submissive.\n Any deviance from these qualities caused men to feel threatened.\n For the more a woman withdraws into the home and gentility the more\n\nthe arenas of government and industry are left to men and men\'s values.\n For the more a servant the women was the more a master the man was.\n For the softer and weaker and more dependent the women was the\n\nstronger and more powerful the appearance of the man.\n As can be seen the sexes were to complement one another.\n\n\nprincipal   principle   that men rule and women obey, carried\n\nwith it inferior    stereotypes   and\n\nmasculist attitudes, proving that this era brought exploitation and\n\noppression to the lives of bourgeois women. \n\n  Edwardian middle-class women enjoyed more career opportunities\n\nthan their middle-class predecessors of the Victorian era.\n This broadened opportunity was in part to due to the 1908 Labour\n\nmovement which favoured economic and social equality between the sexes.\n Alas women were going to be able to enter into fields besides\n\ndomestic services.\n " the young girl of today prefers to become a Board\n\nschool mistress, a post-office clerk, a typewriter, a shop girl, anything\n\nrather than domestic service"  ( Nowell-Smith 1964, 143).\n However, the belief that women were not competent at any task except\n\nthose traditionally designated " women\'s work" plagued the new philosophy of\n\nequality.\n Clerical, teaching and shop keeping were jobs believed to be "\n\nfeminine" in nature.\n In 1901 the percentage of women clerks was 18%, compared to 32% in\n\n1911 ( Nowell-Smith 1964, 187).\n On the surface this increase seems positive, however it does not seem\n\nas positive when comparing it to the percentage of women still employed in\n\ndomestic service.\n In 1911 nearly 2,600,000 people were engaged as servants, over\n\n2,100,000 or approximately 81% of these people were women ( Read 1972, 26)\n Although middle class women might have preferred to be employed\n\noutside the domestic service, the evidence shown proves that their desire to\n\ndo so was not fulfilled.\n The limits put on employment opportunities were not the only economic\n\nconstraints.\n\n\n  With very few exceptions, women could still expect to earn much\n\nless than men for the same work.\n In domestic service the position of butler earned the top wage for a\n\nman, he could earn as much as L100 year.\n The top wage of women within the domestic service was L80 (\n\nNowell-Smith 1994, 145).\n On the surface this difference in wage does not seem that extreme\n\nhowever, it is when comparing the duties of a butler to the duties of a\n\ncook-housekeeper that the inequality of wages strikes one as being\n\nphenomenal.\n The bottom line was that women had to do more work for less pay.\n " there was\n\nan increasing disinclination to employ men-servants, who were more expensive,\n\nless biddable, and needed a license costing 15s.,"  ( Nowell-Smith\n\n1964, 44)\n\n\n  The rationale behind women experiencing an inequality of wages\n\nfinds its roots in a particular attitude.\n The attitude was that men being the bread winners were therefore\n\nentitled to earn more than female workers\n It was believed after all, that women were just supplementary wage\n\nearners, their earnings were seen as complementing the males within the\n\nhousehold.\n The limits imposed on bourgeois women\'s employment opportunities and\n\nearnings kept women inferior in status and economically dependent on men.\n In light of the economic life that middle-class women were subjected\n\nto, the Edwardian era does not seem full of promise. \n\n  Edwardian women did not enjoy a golden era in the realms of\n\npolitics either.\n Many Royal Commissions were set up to review numerous social\n\nregulations existing in Edwardian society.\n The Royal Commission on Divorce and Matrimonial Causes set up in 1909\n\nis just one example.\n " to inquire into the legal disabilities\n\nunder which married women laboured"  ( Cecil 1969 178).\n Finally, after three years the recommendations were given.\n Among other recommendations, the commission stated that women should\n\nbe allowed equality with men before the law with respect to grounds for\n\ndivorce ( Cecil 1969, 178).\n Although the recommendations were voiced in 1912, well within the\n\nEdwardian period, they were not enacted until the 1920\'s\n In fact, the recommendations made by many of the commissions were\n\nalso neglected until after the Edwardian period.\n Proving once again that Edwardian middle class women did not enjoy a\n\npolitical period that was golden. \n\n  Even though women were allowed to vote in local elections, and a\n\nLiberal act in 1907 allowed them to serve upon county councils, women were\n\nstill prohibited in regards to the Parliamentary franchise.\n "\n\nlocal government impinged directly upon women\'s domestic pre-occupations"\n\n and was therefore suitable for women ( Read 1972, 208).\n The National government, however which focused on matters of foreign\n\naffairs, war and finance was held to be beyond the understanding and\n\ncapacities of women.\n The subject of the vote for women caused much debate between the\n\nsexes within the middle class.\n The focus of one debate was whether or not women were physically and\n\npsychologically capable of bearing the responsibilities which would accompany\n\nthe extensions of their present rights.\n It was decided that women would not be able to handle the extensions\n\nbased on the following four reasons: 1. Women were physically weak.\n 2. Women were not able to work with each other.\n 3. Women had a negative effect on men\'s work.\n 4. Women thought subjectively and were therefore irrational. ( Read\n\n1972, 211)\n The results of this debate and other similar debates proved to\n\nheighten the opposition regarding the issue of female emancipation. \n\n  debates such\n\nas the preceding one, middle-class women organized themselves into Women\'s\n\nSuffragist groups\n It was clear to them that because men still believed women to be\n\ninferior that they were going to have to fight for the right to vote.\n Probably the most notorious women\'s group was the Women\'s Social and\n\nPolitical Uunion\n The W.S.P.U. was founded on October 10 1903 and was headed by\n\nEmmmeline Pankhurst and her daughters Cristabel and Sylvia.\n Women believed that the vote would lead to higher wages, economic\n\nindependence, increased job opportunities, and most importantly legal\n\nequality.\n It was further believed that by improving the position of women that\n\nthe relations between men and women would benefit too.\n The Suffragette\'s first attempts at being recognized were\n\nunsuccessful,  every year, on the opening day of Parliament, the\n\nassociation sent a deputation of women to the House of Commons, to meet\n\nso-called friendly Members and consider the position of the women\'s suffrage\n\ncause. \n made\n\n  theirs.\n The ladies thanked the friendly Members for their sympathy, and the\n\nMembers renewed their assurances that they believed in women\'s suffrage and\n\nwould vote for it when they had an opportunity to do so.\n Then the deputation, ... took its departure, and the Members resumed\n\nthe real business of life, ....   . ( Mackenzie, 1975, 20)\n As can be seen militancy was not part of the women\'s movement in the\n\nearly days.\n However, as opposition against the women\'s movement increased, the\n\nmorality behind the tactics used by Mrs. Pankhurst\'s members decreased. \n\n  Middle class women were tiring from the little attention paid to\n\nthem by politicians and the press, and in 1905 their campaign turned to\n\nvarious form of militant action.\n " that they must now act in such a way\n\nas to prove that the Suffragists would no longer quietly submit to this\n\nperpetual ignoring of their claims"  ( Mackenzie 1975,47.)\n This was the beginning of a campaign the like of which was never\n\nknown in England, or for that matter, in any other country.\n The interruption of political meetings, the dispersal of propaganda\n\n   through   pamphlets, and the willingness to be\n\nimprisoned for these acts, were the first militant acts carried out.\n These early militant acts especially the prison sentences proved\n\nsuccessful in gaining some attention and sympathy.\n The most attention came from the press, whose silence up until then\n\nhad  " largely smothered and strangled the movement"  (\n\nMackenzie 1975, 32).\n Although some recognition resulted from these early military acts\n\nthey were not successful in evoking a response from the government.\n Desperately wanting the Liberal government to answer their cry of\n\nfemale suffrage, women found it necessary to increase the militancy of their\n\ncampaign. \n\n  "\n\nPrison, or Votes for Women"  was going to take the issue of women\'s\n\nsuffrage to the forefront.\n There was to be no peace until women were recognized and treated as\n\nequal.\n Emmeline Pankhurst sums up the emotions that the Suffragettes were\n\nfeeling when she says,  " Prison, Votes for Women, and at the moment I\n\nfeel I might be in prison all my life"  ( Mackenzie 1975, 29).\n The members of the W.S.P.U. were instructed by Mrs. Pankhurst to\n\nresemble an army and not give thought to the consequences of their actions.\n Militant acts involved window smashing, arson, bomb explosions and\n\nprison terms.\n These prison terms compared to their initial imprisonments were\n\nlonger and more severe.\n While serving their prison terms these radical women went on hunger\n\nstrikes.\n Their extremism was met by a Liberal government\'s unprecedented\n\ndecision to force feed the striking inmates.\n Force feeding taking both oral and rectal forms aroused widespread\n\ncriticism among Edwardian civilians.\n In response to the criticism the \'Cat and Mouse\' Act was enacted in\n\n1913.\n This act deemed that the Parliament\'s procedures of force feeding\n\nwhile inhumane were sometimes necessary.\n " Our former Laws have been adequate in dealing with\n\nordinary prisoners, but a new set of prisoners have come"   (\n\nMackenzie 1975, 230).\n The act granted temporary release to ailing Suffragists in order to\n\nrecover their health.\n After their health was restored they were to return to prison and\n\nserve the rest of their sentence.\n The government also issued another unprecedented decision, which was\n\nthe power to release without remission of sentence.\n In the case of Emmeline Pankhurst this meant that the fifteen days\n\nthat she took for recovery outside of the prison would be tacked unto her\n\noriginal sentence, so that she would indeed spend a full three years in\n\nprison ( Mackenzie 1975, 230).\n It was hoped that the \'Cat and Mouse Act\' would break the\n\nSuffragist\'s cycle of: defying the law, threatening to commit militant acts,\n\nbeing sent to prison, being let out in a few days to be militant again.\n The Liberal government\'s histrionic decisions although producing a\n\nnegative effect for themselves actually increased sympathy towards the\n\nimprisoned Suffragists.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '49ffd3c8-8ef0-4d58-b9e2-a7dedecd0c3e', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.689230+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9861626625061035, 'non_english_score': 0.013837337493896484}
{'text': 'Until the last 10 to 15 years, the interpretation of Canadian\n\nlabour history has always come from the \'Whig Interpretation\'.\n That is, the institutionalization of labour relations are been seen as\n\nprogressive, thus creating the notion that  " ...once there was only a\n\nragged army of beleaguered unions, we now find imposing array of duly\n\ncertified bargaining units."  \n The popular interpretation of Canadian labour history today opposes\n\nthis point of view.\n Most historian(s) today seem to base their evidence within a regional\n\ncontext.\n .\n The young historians that have presented essays in the collection\n\nconcentrates on four main themes: workers and the government, workers and\n\npolitical parties, workers and the union structure, and the workers and the\n\ncompany. \n\n  look at the\n\nfundamental relationship of the worker and the governmental structure.\n As stated previously, the views of past historians seem to be that the\n\nstate has created this impressive and beneficial system within which labour\n\noperates.\n Many authors rescind this point of view, saying that the state has\n\nonly succeeded in restricting the rights of union members during labour\n\nnegotiations.\n Craig Heron outlined this idea in the Afterward of the collection.\n He stated that until the Industrial Disputes Act of 1907, most of the\n\nlabours involved in the unions could strike anytime they wished over any\n\nissue they felt prudent.\n When this act became law, the problems that the workers wished to\n\nstrike over were presented to a conciliation board and then, only after a 30\n\nday waiting period could the union go on strike. \n\n  Suzanne Morton also attacked government intervention in her essay\n\non labour relations during the reconstruction of Halifax.\n She studied the conflict between the Halifax Relief Commission ( HRC)\n\nand the skilled labourers that came to the city to work on construction.\n The provincial government gave the power of setting wages to the HRC,\n\nthus the traditional employee-employer relationship was in jeopardy.\n When the workers struck over wages and the use of migrant-unskilled\n\nworkers, the conservative HRC just employed scab labours.\n The HRC attacked the attitudes of the skilled labours, that mostly\n\nresided in the areas that involved in the explosion. \n\n  In Fred Winsor\'s essay on the battle by the offshore fishermen\n\nfor worker\'s compensation.\n Winsor reveals the position of the fishermen by showing how, because\n\nof a lack of a strong union, they were unable to gain provincial compensation\n\nwithout paying an extremely high cost ( at times &dollar;20 for every\n\n&dollar;100 of income).\n This essay show how a government program, which was available to most\n\nof Nova Scotia\'s workers, was withheld from a deserving group because of the\n\nlack of a unified voice. \n\n  Finally, Kirby Abbott looked at government intervention in the\n\nNova Scotia coal industry at the latter decades of the 19th century.\n With the Coal Mines Regulation Act and the encouragement of the\n\ncreation of the Dominion Coal Company ( Domco), the provincial government\n\nwould not support the creation of unions, such as a branch of the United Mine\n\nWorkers.\n The government used its authority to suppress radical labour\n\nmovements and promote big business. \n\n  As well as looking at the relationship between the worker and the\n\nstate,  Workers and the State  also investigates the theme of\n\nworkers and politics.\n At the turn of the century, most of the unions began affiliating with\n\nthe Communist Party, which in turn took over much of the leadership.\n In the 1930\'s, the social-democratic Cooperative Commonwealth\n\nFederation was formed and preached a milder form of socialism.\n Michael Earle and Hebert Gamberg investigated the coming of the CCF\n\ninto the Cape Breton area.\n It seems at this time, most of the labour membership was moving\n\ntoward a less radical stance, thus embraced the CCF with great enthusiasm.\n\n\n\n  Michael Earle also investigated the importance of the CCF in the\n\nexecutive of the unions of Nova Scotia.\n In this essay, Earle showed how right-wing and radical communist\n\nfactions battled for control of the unions.\n During this process, the CCF was trying to destroy the influence of\n\nthe communists in their unions. \n\n  Workers and\n\nthe State  looks at is the relationship between the worker and the union\n\nleadership.\n Many essays in the collection focus on this theme.\n Jay White covered this aspect in his essay that looked strike for\n\ncheck-off in the Halifax Shipyards.\n In a battle with the Halifax Shipyard Limited, the workers fought for\n\nthe union security and the automatic taking off union dues from all\n\nemployees.\n White points out that collapse of the strike and the downfall of the\n\nunion was based on the mismanagement of strike funds and company sympathy by\n\nthe leadership. \n\n  This problem was also faced by Anthony Thompson in his study of\n\nthe unionization of the Nova Scotia civil service.\n In this essay, he shows how the executive of the union forced the\n\nwage ceiling of 5% on arbitrated contracts.\n The leadership made the workers support the policy under the fear of\n\na strike option presented by Gerald Regan, the Liberal Premier. \n\n  looks at the\n\nrelationship between the worker and the company.\n Both C.H.J. Gilson and A.M. Wadden as well as E. Jean Ninbet looked\n\nat this issue in their respective essays.\n Nisbet showed how the attempt by the Nova Scotia fishermen to form a\n\nunion was defeated by the strong, monopolistic National Sea fish company.\n\n\nlose   their status as \'co-adventurers\'.\n Gilson and Wadden studied the Windsor Gypsum Strike and the formation\n\nof the Joint Labour/Management Study Committee by the Nova Scotia government.\n They found that labour really had very little power within the\n\ncommittee and was manipulated by the government backed business interests.\n\n\n\n  has essays that have\n\ncommon themes that links group of them together.\n These themes or relationships include: workers and the government,\n\nworkers and political parties, workers and union leadership, and finally,\n\nworkers and the company.\n These are all themes that are relevant to the general study of labour\n\nhistory today.  \n\n\n\n  George F. Keenan had mixed feelings about the Nuremberg Trials.\n He felt that the crimes of the Nazis were innumberable and held\n\nno synpathy towards them, but he strongly opposed to any programs of\n\ndenazification.\n Kennan felt great remorse over the plans that the Allies had in\n\nrelation to the treatment of Germans over the punishment for the war crimes\n\ncommitted.\n He thought that the choice of carrying out public trials was\n\ninappropriate in that it could not undo any of the crimes, and that when the\n\nSoviets were taken in as Allies the Americans also excepted the customs of\n\nwarfare which went on in Eastern Europe and Asia for centuries. \n These customs were not particular or genuine to Germany.\n In Kennan\'s view, this procedure of incriminating the Germans was\n\nwrong in that it led people to believe that these crimes were justifiable\n\nwhen committed by one government, but unjustifiable and punishable by\n\ndeath when committed by another government. \n He stated that the best treatment towards Germany would have been to\n\nshow that Germany was not strong enough to pose a threat to other great\n\npowers, and an attempt in this direction would only be unsuccessful and\n\nlead to disaster. \n Kennan was particularly disturbed to see the Americans associate\n\nthemselves with the Russians when judging the conduct of the Germans, and\n\nfelt a deep sense of despair and frustration.  \n\n  To the Americans, and certainly their Allies, the Nuremberg\n\nTrials were seen as completely necessary in order to hurt Germany for\n\ninitiating war and for the countless, and harsh crimes committed.\n But, as in any case, there will be individuals who disagree with\n\nthis belief, one being George F. Kennan.\n He was unable to see how the Allies, particularly the Soviets, could\n\npunish the Germans for the same crimes they had themselves committed,\n\nthe only difference being they were conducted under different governments.\n When the trials came to an end on August 31, 1946, nineteen German\n\nmen were found guilty on various charges, with the sentences ranging from ten\n\nyears in jail to the death penalty, and three individuals were acquit <l>\n\nted. \n The brutal violence and evil crimes that occurred during World War II\n\nwere intolerable acts that could not be left alone, merely forgotten,\n\nwithout calling them to the attention of the public.\n It will never be known whether the trials were the best method of\n\npenalizing the Germans, but at that time certain measures had to be carried\n\nout in order for the world to rest after such a traumatic experience as total\n\nwar.  \n\n\n\n  In examining a work as unique as " Kubla Khan", it is crucial to\n\ngo beyond simply looking at the structure and symbols used; one must take\n\ninto account the details of the author\'s life.\n\n\n Poets   Society", the reader must do more than objectively\n\nevaluate and graph poetry, as the moth-balled J. Evans Pritchard would tell\n\nus to do.\n It is crucial, especially with the Romantic poets to understand them\n\nin the context of their attempts to convey the  " spontaneous overflow\n\nof powerful feelings"  ( Wordsworth 160).\n In this case let us examine Coleridge as a person.\n He grew up in London, and never experienced the wild country to the\n\nextent his good friend Wordsworth did ( 328).\n Always known as a dreamer, Coleridqe\'s addiction to laudanum, with\n\nits hallucinogenic properties, no doubt added a new dimension to his\n\ndreaming.\n That Coleridge was capable of such fanciful notions is not in\n\nquestion. \n\n  " Kubla Khan"; This mysterious poem has many possible\n\ninterpretations.\n Nothing is going on in the poem in terms of actions or events taking\n\nplace.\n In the first two sections Coleridge lays out his vision, and in the\n\nlast section he assumes the voice of the narrator and explains the danger of\n\nglimpsing at this forbidden paradise. \n\n  The vision is composed of many images.\n (\n\n355)contrasts hot with cold.\n Throughout the poem a dark feeling of sexuality and of life itself\n\npervades.\n The pleasure dome may refer to a female breast, and images of\n\ncaverns, fertile grounds, forests, deep romantic chasms slanting down the\n\ngreen hill and a woman wailing for her demon lover all trigger erotic\n\nthoughts ( 354-355).\n And from this chasm, with\n\nceaseless turmoil seething, As if this earth in fast thick pants were\n\nbreathing, A mighty fountain momently was forced: Amid whose swift\n\nhalf-intermitted burst Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail \n\n , ( 355 17-21)\n This passage may be interpreted as a well-expressed description of a\n\nfemale giving birth, or possibly of male ejaculation. \n\n  Alph, the sacred river connects this birth with the pleasure\n\ndome, and the river  " meanders with a mazy motion"  from\n\nfertile grounds through the  " caverns measureless to man" \n\ndown to a sunless sea, which is lifeless.\n This suggests the cyclical passage of life towards eternity or death\n\n\n\n  In the last section the poet assumes the narrative voice.\n He explains how if he could describe what he saw, namely the vision\n\nof the pleasure dome and the caves of ice, as clearly as the damsel with her\n\ndulcimer sings of the paradise of Mount Abora ( 355), then people would think\n\nhim insane and would alienate him as someone who has experienced forbidden\n\nthings. \n\n  Coleridge feels he has had a forbidden experience partially\n\nbecause of the guilt he feels in abusing the drug opium, and also because he\n\ndoubts the general public will either understand or accept the fantastic\n\nvision he has seen:   Weave a circle round him thrice And close\n\nyour eyes with holy dread, For he on honeydew hath fed, And drunk the milk of\n\nParadise.   ( 355) \n\n  Undoubtedly some feel " Kubla Khan" is incomplete, but Coleridge\n\ncan go no further.\n\n\n the way the images were collected.\n Recollections gathered from being half asleep, with a hazy memory,\n\nare just that; half remembered.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '7f495bfa-6b1b-42d0-bb00-d1e6d26a18d2', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.690879+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9766968488693237, 'non_english_score': 0.02330315113067627}
{'text': 'Trapped on a Pedestal:"The Blessed Damozel" and " The Lady of\n\nShalott" \n\n  The Victorian Age was characterised by strict social conventions\n\nthat restricted women to specific roles.\n These roles were defined with the notion of a distinction between the\n\nprivate and public spheres: men belonged in the public sphere, looking after\n\nbusiness, and women belonged in the private, looking after the men and\n\nchildren.\n There was no confusion between the roles; they were clearly defined\n\nand social protocol dictated that they be followed.\n The restriction for women to these subordinate roles is seen in\n\ncomparing Dante Gabriel Rossetti\'s " The Blessed Damozel" and Alfred, Lord\n\nTennyson\'s " The Lady of Shalott".\n The similarity between the two poems is quite remarkable.\n Both poems are about women in private spheres, separated from society,\n\nyearning to be with men.\n Whereas Tennyson\'s poem clearly reinforces Victorian ideals,\n\nRossetti\'s appears to celebrate the transgression of the normative barriers.\n However, both poems conclude in a manner that perpetuates Victorian\n\nideals of women remaining sequestered in    their \n\n private spheres. \n\n  The first apparent similarity is the spaces that the Blessed\n\nDamozel and the Lady of Shalott occupy.\n They are both separated from the rest of society in a high place.\n (\n\nTennyson 17) in  " four gray walls, and four gray towers"  (\n\nTennyson 15).\n She is clearly isolated in this high place; no one has seen her,\n\n " only reapers"  ( Tennyson 28) have heard her sing.\n We receive the sensation of the height of her tower with the many\n\nreferences of  " down to Camelot"  ( Tennyson 14, 23, 32, 41,\n\n50, 86, 95, 104, 113, 140) that further distance her from the rest of\n\nsociety.\n (\n\nTennyson 59), as she remains static and isolated in her tower.\n She is not allowed to directly view the real world; she only sees\n\n " shadows of the world"  ( Tennyson 48) in the mirror above\n\nher loom, thereby furthering her disengagement from society.\n " lean[s] out / From the gold bar of\n\nheaven"  ( Rossetti 1-2), isolated from people on earth and from\n\nother spirits.\n Again, we have the sensation of height as she looks down on earth,\n\nbut she is  " so high, that looking downward thence / She scarce could\n\nsee the sun"  ( Rossetti 29-30), and can not see the society she\n\nwishes to engage in.\n Both women are disengaged from society, as the Lady of Shalott is\n\nonly able to see shadowy images of the real world in a mirror, the Blessed\n\nDamozel is unable to see the earth.\n "\n\nstoop[s] / Out of the circling charm"  ( Rossetti 43-44) to look down\n\nat her lover.\n " souls mounting up to God / [ go] by her like thin\n\nflames"  ( Rossetti 41-42) as she remains stationary at the gold bar.\n Both of the isolated women portrayed in these Victorian poems are\n\nseparated from society by the height of their private spaces.\n The high places these women occupy can be seen as representing the\n\npedestal that society places the image of women on.\n Society constrains women with this image; real women become trapped,\n\nunable to move from that pedestal.\n This is seen in the two poems as the immobile, isolated women are\n\nconfined to high places. \n\n  The private space Victorian women were supposed to occupy was the\n\ndomestic sphere.\n The Lady of Shalott evidently occupies such a space as she is\n\nsecluded from the surrounding nature:  " the river"  , \n\n" long fields of barley and of rye"  ,  " willows"  ,\n\n " aspens"  , and  " a space of flowers"  (\n\nTennyson 1, 2, 10, 16), and is a part of the interior sphere of gray towers\n\nand walls.\n " by\n\nnight and day"  ( Tennyson 37).\n She passively toils away at her work, while ignoring all of the\n\nactivity going on in the public sphere outside of her tower.\n The Blessed Damozel, on the other hand, does not occupy a domestic\n\nspace, but rather a spiritual space.\n According to Victorian values, these two private spaces represent\n\nwhat women should represent: purity, chastity and virtue.\n These values are affiliated with spiritual and domestic spaces,\n\nfurthering the similarities between the poems.\n The Blessed Damozel obviously occupies a spiritual place as she is in\n\nHeaven.\n " she had three\n\nlilies in her hand, / And the stars in her hair were seven"  (\n\nTennyson 5-6).\n These numbers hold significant religious symbolism for christianity,\n\nwhich was predominant in 19th century Europe.\n The number three represents the divine trinity: God the Father, Jesus\n\nthe Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n The number seven is significant as it represents the completeness\n\nemblematic in the seven sacraments and the seven seals in the book of\n\nRevelation.\n With the Blessed Damozel occupying the spiritual sphere and the Lady\n\nof Shalott occupying the domestic sphere, they both denote the private sphere\n\nthat confined Victorian women. \n\n  Both of these women reach the same crisis: they no longer want to\n\noccupy the spaces they are restricted to.\n In these spaces they are separated from earthly love; the Blessed\n\nDamozel is separated from her lover on earth, and the Lady of Shalott is\n\nseparated from Sir Lancelot who goes by to Camelot.\n They both have active desires to cross the barriers that separate\n\nthem from the social relations.\n The Blessed Damozel wishes to leave the golden bar and be with her\n\nlover, as seen in Rossetti\'s painting of his poem.\n\n\n( Tennyson 71) and wishes to leave her tower and be with Sir Lancelot.\n This crisis is problematic because it contradicts the Victorian value\n\nof chastity as these women actively desire the physical presence of a male,\n\nthereby necessitating women leaving their allocated spaces and entering the\n\npublic sphere.\n By looking down from their occupied high places, the Blessed Damozel\n\nand the Lady of Shalott display their desire to transgress the barriers of\n\nsocial convention; the Blessed Damozel from her bar in Heaven, and the Lady\n\nof Shalott from her window in the tower. \n\n  This is where the similarities in handling the crisis end.\n Rossetti\'s Damozel passively waits for her lover to come to her.\n " that he were to come"\n\n ( Rossetti 67) while standing  " along / The golden barriers,\n\n/ And la[ying] her face between her hands / And we[eping]"  (\n\nRossetti 141-144).\n She remains a passive female in her allocated private space, thereby\n\nconforming to social conventions.\n It is for this reason that her portrayal is such a positive one.\n From the begining she is marked as blessed and good.\n ,\n\n " a white rose"  ( Rossetti 5, 9), and light:  " stars\n\nin her hair"  ,  " her hair ... was yellow"  ,  "\n\nthe sun"  ( Rossetti 6, 12, 30).\n Rossetti appears to celebrate her active desire with these sensuous\n\nand romanticized images, which are evident in Pre-Raphaelite paintings.\n However, it is because she remains in a passive and purely female\n\nrole, characteristic of Victorian values, that she is seen as good.\n " until her bosom must have made / The bar she\n\nleaned on warm"  ( Rossetti 45-46).\n She warms the bar of Heaven and her lover can hear and see her ( the \'I\'\n\nin the parentheses of lines 139 and 144) since her love is so strong.\n She does nothing and waits until the male lover can come and save\n\nher.\n " take his hand and go with\n\nhim / To the deep wells of light"  ( Rossetti 75-76).\n She will receive her reward, her lover, for remaining in that typical\n\nfemale role, weeping.\n So, although Rossetti celebrates her active desire for her lover, he\n\nperpetuates Victorian values that women should remain passive and in their\n\nprivate spaces. \n\n  Tennyson\'s approach to dealing with the Lady of Shalott\'s crisis\n\nof desire is much more evident as sustaining Victorian values than\n\nRossetti\'s.\n The Lady of Shalott takes action, and reverses the traditional role\n\nof men looking at women; she looks at Sir Lancelot.   She left the\n\nweb, she left the loom, She made three paces through the room, She saw the\n\nwater lily bloom, She saw the helmet and the plume, She looked down to\n\nCamelot   ( Tennyson 109-113)\n By leaving her loom, she leaves behind the traditional space that she\n\nshould occupy and goes against social convention.\n The same symbols of purity are seen as in " The Blessed Damozel", the\n\nnumber three and the lily; yet, the Lady of Shalott is not associated with\n\nthem.\n Where the Blessed Damozel is associated with the light, the Lady of\n\nShalott is associated with the dark and night;  " gray towers"\n\n ,  " shadows"  , and  " the moon"  (\n\nTennyson 15, 48, 69).\n Tennyson\'s poem is warning women not to take action, like the Lady of\n\nShalott.\n She takes action and consequently, dies.\n She does not conform to social conventions like the Blessed Damozel,\n\nand therefore, her portrayal is a negative one.\n She is marked from the beginning as having a curse upon her, whereas\n\nRossetti\'s Damozel is blessed.\n\n\ncomes, bringing rain ( Tennyson 118-121).\n She does not remain the passive female confined to her domestic\n\nspace, and as a result chaos breaks loose as she acts on her desires.\n Whereas Rossetti\'s passive Damozel will one day receive the reward of\n\nher lover, the Lady of Shalott\'s reward for actively seeking Sir Lancelot and\n\nleaving the constraining pedestal of her tower, is death. \n\n  The difference in the consequences of the crisis of physical\n\nlongings for the two women is seen in the simple act of singing.\n For the Blessed Damozel, singing is a joyous reward that she will\n\nreceive for passively waiting for her lover.\n (\n\nRossetti 91-93) in Heaven.\n ( Rossetti 125)\n\nas the two lovers are reunited  " forever now, / Together"  (\n\nRossetti 131-132).\n Again, we see that the celebration of her physical desire will be\n\nrewarded with the unison of song, yet it will only occur as she remains\n\ninactive and waiting.\n On the other hand, the Lady of Shalott and Sir Lancelot\'s singing are\n\nforever separate in their distinct spheres.\n The loneliness and isolation of the Lady of Shalott\'s tower is seen\n\nas reapers  " hear a song that echoes"  ( Tennyson 30) from\n\nher private space.\n ( Tennyson 107) song\n\ntempts her to look out into the public space.\n They each sing in their own spheres, never to be united.\n This demonstrates the punitive measures of Tennyson reprimanding\n\nwomen for taking an active role, like the Lady of Shalott did.\n Both poems have the same message; if a woman is good and waits for\n\nher lover to come to her pedestal, she will be rewarded with happiness and\n\nsong, but if she actively seeks out that man and leaves the pedestal, she\n\nwill be alone forever. \n\n  Both Tennyson\'s " The Lady of Shalott" and Rossetti\'s " The\n\nBlessed Damozel" perpetuate Victorian values of the subordination of women to\n\nmen.\n The love objects that are desired in these poems are men.\n This reverses the typical roles seen in Petrarchan sonnets, but it\n\nmaintains the same notion of subservient women; they can only desire, not act\n\non their desires.\n It is the man who must come to rescue the woman trapped on the\n\npedestal.\n Both men in these poems are portrayed as the good, \'white knight\'\n\nthat will save the \'damsels in distress\'.\n " glitter[s]"\n\n , and  " flash[es]"  with  " his broad clear\n\nbrow in sunlight glow[ing]"  as he rides by Shalott ( Tennyson 81,\n\n83, 106, 100).\n He can not rescue the Lady of Shalott because she acts on her\n\ndesires, and is therefore, not a true \'damsel\'.\n The Blessed Damozel will one day be rescued because she remains in\n\nthe role of a true \'damsel in distress\'.\n with an\n\n " aureole"  around his head to take her  " to the deep\n\nwells of light"  ( Rossetti 73-76).\n Both men, associated with white and light, are redeemers who save\n\nthose who remain confined to the pedestal of social convention. \n\n  Although Rossetti\'s " The Blessed Damozel" celebrates the active\n\ndesire of a woman longing for her lover, it sustains the same values as\n\nTennyson\'s " The Lady of Shalott", which evidently reprimands a woman for\n\nacting on her desire.\n They both portray the same 19th century construction of femininity\n\nwhich values women being kept in their submissive private place.\n The importance of the distinction between the private and public\n\nsphere for the Victorian era is seen as both women in the poems are confined\n\nto private spaces and cut off from social relations; one in a domestic space,\n\nthe other in a spiritual space.\n Both are restricted in high places, which can be seen as representing\n\na pedestal that society puts the image of women upon.\n If women conform to that image of purity and passivity, they are\n\nrewarded by being rescued by men.\n It is because the Blessed Damozel remains at her bar waiting and\n\nweeping that she is portrayed as good; the Lady of Shalott breaks away from\n\nher space and is hence portrayed as dark and punished with death.\n Tennyson\'s message is evident, if women act on their desires they\n\nare bad.\n Rossetti\'s poem celebrates the Blessed Damozel\'s desire, which\n\nappears to transgress the typical female role; but she remains passive and\n\ninactive, thus immobile upon the constricting pedestal of feminine ideals.\n Both women desire to be free from their restrictive sphere and to be\n\nwith the men they long for.\n Through different approaches in dealing with this crisis, Rossetti\n\nand Tennyson perpetuate the same Victorian values: women should remain\n\npassive in their private spaces.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '07eb3e24-4351-4c67-9812-a5a78cf7fc77', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.692462+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9665272831916809, 'non_english_score': 0.03347271680831909}
{'text': 'Kubla\n\nKhan  \n\n  The word " \'dream\' " is by nature an ambiguous\n\none that involves an obvious aspect of duality.\n It can imply hopes, aspirations and desires as a verb, while at the\n\nsame time refer to those inner, irrational images we experience in sleep as a\n\nnoun.\n A particular dream then may encompass both of these aspects, but does\n\nnot necessarily require so by definition.\n In addition, it is important to remember that dreams during sleep can\n\nbe either pleasant { good) or disturbing ( bad).\n Furthermore, in utilizing dreams the author achieves very significant\n\neffects, in comparison to the traditionally rationale and logical style of\n\nwriting.\n Such is the case with Joseph Conrad\'s Heart of Darkness and Samuel\n\nColeridge\'s  Kubla Khan  .\n Each use the concept of dreams in unique ways, and in doing so\n\naccomplish different effects.\n In this essay, I will examine these two literary works as dream texts\n\nand discuss the ramifications of writing a text in the random, non-linear,\n\nassociative manner of dreams. \n\n  Heart of\n\nDarkness  .\n Dreams in this text can be examined in many ways.\n There exists both a sense of the sleeping dreams, and the aspiration\n\nor hope-type dreams.\n Conrad accomplishes tasks through the use of dreams that he would not\n\nbe able to in other methods of discourse; specifically through the ambiguity\n\nof dreams themselves. \n\n  Chronologically, dreams are first made reference to through the\n\ncharacter of Marlow.\n During his pastime of looking at maps, he speaks of dreams in the\n\nsense of having a hope to go places in the world for adventure:  " ...I\n\nwould put my finger on it and say, When I grow up I will go there...But there\n\nwas one yet - the biggest, the most blank so to speak - that I had a\n\nhankering after [ Africa]."  ( Conrad, p. 33)\n Through this first introduction to dreams, it becomes apparent that\n\nMarlow has an initial attraction to the continent of Africa, and constitutes\n\npart of his wanting to go there.\n Hence, Conrad uses this dream to somewhat explain the story in more\n\nrealistic ways.\n The fact that Marlow has always wanted to go there, makes it all the\n\nmore likely for the reader to accept his decision to enter a wild and savage\n\nplace.\n What results, is a greater proximity to the \'inner\' make-up of\n\nMarlow\'s character. \n\n  A further instance whereby the word " \'dream\' "\n\nis used as a verb, is Marlow\'s relentless drive to meet Kurtz; who Marlow is\n\ntold is  " a very remarkable man"  by the accountant.\n However, this borders on the other meaning of dream in that it\n\nreaches a very personal level.\n Ostensibly, it could be argued that the story is about Marlow\'s dream\n\nto meet Kurtz.\n It is strongly suggested that the meeting of Kurtz is in fact\n\nMarlow\'s dream, in the following citing, whereby he first meets Kurtz:\n\n  " I looked at him lost in astonishment...His very existence was\n\nimprobable, inexplicable and altogether bewildering.\n It was inconceivable how he had existed...how he had managed to\n\nremain - why he did not instantly disappear."   ( Conrad, p.93).\n\n\n\n  Marlow makes specific reference to Kurtz being the dream.\n As is the case when one wakes up from a dream, the images of the\n\ndream usually disappear and fade away.\n We somehow lose connection with the feelings we had been experiencing\n\nonly moments before, the manifest content of the dream.\n Kurtz then, resembles the state of being in a dream, but Marlow can\n\nnot understand why he does not  \'instantly disappear\'  , and\n\nlabels his existence as  \'improbable\'  as are most images\n\nwithin dreams. \n\n  To Marlow then, Kurtz resembles a dream taken to its furthest\n\nextent and includes both definitions of the ambiguous word " \'dream\'\n\n" .\n While Kurtz can represent an aspiration of a great man he wishes to\n\nmeet, Marlow also sees this as a dream, that he somehow can not ever meet\n\nKurtz in reality.\n When he does meet him, it is beyond his comprehension and he is very\n\nset back by it.\n A notion then exists that Marlow\'s dream has come true in reality.\n This represents a pleasantry for Marlow, and is an instance of a good\n\ndream. \n\n  In contrast to this is Kurtz\'s dream, to become very wealthy and\n\npowerful, consequently at the expense of others.\n Again, this is a dream in the verb sense.\n One can come to this conclusion based on his callous treatment of the\n\nnatives, as well as the fact that he had  " collected, bartered,\n\nswindled, or stolen more ivory than all the other agents together"  (\n\nConrad, p. 83)\n Kurtz has complete disregard for all others, as evidenced by his\n\npower exertion over the natives, and the very fact that he threatened to kill\n\na man to get a small amount of ivory.\n So, consumed by his dream for wealth and power, Kurtz will kill a man\n\nin the progressing towards his dream.\n We learn of his great possessive character in our recollection of him\n\nby the narrator:  " You should have heard him say \'My ivory.\' \n Oh, yes.\n I heard him. \'My Intended, my ivory, my station, my river, my...\' "\n\n  ( Conrad, p. 85) \n\n  Later in the text, just before his death, Kurtz utters the\n\nnotorious words  \'the horror, the horror.\'  In the scope of a\n\ndream text, these words are strongly emblematic of a nightmare.\n Waking up from his \'dream\', he experiences a recollection of what he\n\nhas done in his great attempt to fulfil his dream.\n The very nature of his actions against the natives come out in this\n\nphrase.\n Linking this to dreams, one interpretation is that, again, this is\n\nthe immediate remembrance of one\'s dream that have occurred just a short time\n\nago.\n After awaking, a dream it is still fresh within one\'s memory, but\n\ngradually fades away.\n Resultingly, a correlation with dreams themselves exists through\n\nthese famous words.\n To extend the metaphor there exists a vagueness of the words\n\nthemselves, much like the vagueness of a dream.\n It is in this way that Kurtz could be said to have awoke from a\n\nnightmare, which is obviously deemed as the \'bad\' dream. \n\n  Heart of\n\nDarkness  , is the one by Marlow in his attempt to somehow create an\n\nimage of Kurtz as a man\n " it is impossible to convey the life\n\nsensation of any given epoch of one\'s existence - that which makes its truth,\n\nits meaning - its subtle and penetrating essence. \n It is impossible.\n ( Conrad, p. 57)\n This is Marlow\'s best attempt to express the futility of ever\n\nexplaining your dreams to another person, and of language more broadly. \n\n  are effective in that\n\nthey give a greater understanding of the characters of Marlow and Kurtz, as\n\nwell as the whole notion of the European colonization of Africa.\n The very fact that the story has taken place in the past, and that\n\nsome of the events are very dramatic and irrational, make it come across as\n\nbeing a dream of the narrator.\n At one point in time, the narrator actually addresses the audience\n\nand says:  " Do you see him?  Do you see the story? Do you see\n\nanything? It seems to me I am trying to tell you a dream"   (\n\nConrad, p. 57)\n Also the various absurd events throughout the novel, further\n\nreinforce this idea.\n For instance the two women knitting yarn and the man measuring the\n\nsize of Marlow\'s head.\n Through dreams, Conrad makes the events of the novel more\n\nunderstandable and allows us to comprehend the characters within it to a\n\ngreater extent. \n\n  use of dream is a critical aspect,\n\nas it is the medium by which the \'story\' is revealed.\n Such is the way that Coleridge wrote Kubla Khan, through his\n\ninvolvement with the unconscious, as dreams themselves so involve.\n His use of dreams in poetry is unique in that he is essentially\n\nproposing the writing in fragmentation as a fit and suitable style of poetry.\n Whereas Conrad\'s use of dream helps to define the nature of the\n\ntext\'s main characters, Coleridge use of dreams sends out a message.\n The driving theme of the poem is the loss of poetic vision.\n This is reinforced by the creation of the man from Porlock, whereby\n\nColeridge has lost over two hundred lines of \'inspiration\' by his\n\ndisturbance.\n The very title of the poem itself suggests that this is a poem about\n\nwriting poetry. \n\n  The opening movement in the poem is one of control.\n The King overlooks his pleasure dome, a place fit for kings.\n In this way, the outside world is cut off, much in the same way as\n\none is cut off from the outside world while in a dream.\n Furthermore, Kubla has built this place from his vision, it is a\n\nworld of cultivation whereby society is cut off from everything.\n The poem further develops in a very sexually suggestive fashion,\n\nwhereby there exists a relationship between Kubla and every facet of his\n\nrepressed ( forbidden) forces.\n Again, much as one\'s dreams are in reality.\n This forbidden force is represented by the woman at the bottom of the\n\nfalls, and further develops the theme of poetic vision as being momentary and\n\nephemeral. \n\n  Coleridge then makes a final reflection on the role of the poet\n\nwithin society, through the dream-text.\n He has tasted the divine and it has turned him into a demon.\n He perceives people as being jealous of this experience and he\n\nbecomes a self consumed monster.\n Dreams make it permissible for him to make the claim that society is\n\nafraid of him; and that they try to keep him within the thunderdome as a\n\nresult.\n This is in direct conflict with any belief that he wants to be in the\n\nthunderdome.\n Coleridge, in summation uses dreams as an easy medium to relay a\n\nmessage to society concerning the loss of poetic vision. \n\n  Dreams within Coleridge\'s text can be interpreted resultingly, in\n\nmuch the same way as Sigmund Freud interpreted them in the 19th century; as\n\nkeys into the unconscious of the individual.\n To understand the world, Coleridge attends not to the present things\n\nof the world but to that which is repressed, hidden away.\n Through dreams we collapse upon ourselves.\n We do not see beyond ourselves; to be oneself then is to be an exile.\n The exile condition being emblematic of what it means to be a person,\n\nconstantly alienated.\n Dreams offer a way to explore the alienation of individuals.\n The isolation and inability to fully comprehend ourselves, let alone\n\nanyone else. \n\n  Heart of\n\nDarkness  as well.\n ,\n\nhe is clearly revealing to the reader, that one can never get to the interior\n\nof another individual.\n " no relation of a dream can reveal the dream\n\nsensation."  ( Conrad, p. 57)\n This runs parallel to dreams in that dreaming is an individual\n\nexperience.\n Reference is being made to Kurtz, whereby he sees Kurtz only as a\n\nname, and an enigma that can never be revealed or exposed by one\'s\n\nrecollection of them. \n\n  In general, there are many effects that are achieved through the\n\ncreation of dream-texts.\n The creation of the irrational, random chaotic, and non-linearity of\n\nthe works definitely allows for a dissociation of the author from their work.\n Furthermore, it is a nice move to keep criticism at bay.\n This is especially so in Kubla Khan, where Coleridge can claim that\n\nhe did not write the poem, and that the poem was wrote through him, hence\n\nhaving no legitimate author. \n\n  Secondly, dreams allow for the extraordinary to become ordinary.\n The chaotic nature of dreams is reduced to a regularity; whereby what\n\nis being expressed is not that chaotic at all.\n It makes the difficult and complex easy to comprehend, and in doing\n\nso gives passage for the reader into realms they have not had previously had\n\nsimplified access to.\n This is one of Coleridge\'s most notable skills, and it allows for\n\nthe reader a greater ability to experience the irrational.\n Dreams give us access to the darker side of a person, the aspects of\n\nthe mind that are rejected and repressed. \n\n  and\n\nColeridge\'s  Kubla Khan  , are dream texts in the purest sense.\n They both rely on dreams as essential literary tools in giving the\n\nreader a deeper understanding of the text itself.\n Whereas Conrad uses dreams to reveal the inner makeup of his\n\ncharacters, Coleridge uses dreams to create an analogy for the loss of poetic\n\nvision, and hence to send out a message.\n The effect of writing their texts in the random, non-linear,\n\nassociative manner of dreams better allows for the accomplishment of their\n\npurposes and is an integral aspect for the development of their respective\n\nthemes.\n Both also rely on the very essence of dreams in order to succeed.\n The individuality of dreams, and the fact that they are unaccessible\n\nto others makes them all the more elusive in their understanding.\n The chaotic nature of the dream-text then requires a further\n\nanalysis of what is actually being expressed by the author, and in that sense\n\nforces the reader to take an active role in its understanding.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '93844a0b-9912-4222-bb46-59528249dd24', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.693960+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9741796851158142, 'non_english_score': 0.02582031488418579}
{'text': 'Culture functions to establish and uphold the values and norms of\n\nsociety.\n It is culture which civilizes and suppresses the savage aspect of the\n\nindividual to conform with the values prescribed by society.\n However, this value system is heading towards destruction.\n Culture can no longer conceal the savage instincts of the individual.\n It is socially situated that we act in a prescribed manner.\n Society decides what norms and values are acceptable, how people are\n\nto act and feel.\n Culture is society\'s way of implementing, imposing, and enforcing\n\nthese norms.\n It conceals the savagery which is part of our societal past and\n\nsupresses these instincts to make people civilized.\n However, by suppressing these savage instincts we are suppressing\n\npart of ourselves and eventually this will lead to the overturning of the\n\nsocial norms.\n\n\nYeats\'   The Second Coming  are literary representations of the\n\nself-destructive nature of western society.\n By suppressing our savage instincts we are destroying ourselves.\n The norms which were established to organize, structure and civilize,\n\nare the corroding forces which will eventually lead to society\'s downfall.\n Culture has transformed the individual from savagery to civility and\n\nnow society, as a whole, will journey through a heart of darkness, realizing\n\nthe effect of this suppression, while moving towards a second coming or\n\nrelease and return of the savage instincts. \n\n  Society uses culture to control and manipulate individuals into\n\nacting in a prescribed manner.\n These controlling forces, or norms, are the values strictly upheld by\n\nwestern society.\n These norms include notions of what people should do, how they should\n\nact, as well as how people should feel.\n The business class, men, women, and all other members of society are\n\nsubject to these norms.\n However, these social values have only served to suppress the\n\nindividual of his or her instinctual drives and desires.\n Conrad and Yeats both draw attention to the imposing nature of\n\nculture to civilize the individual. \n\n \n\nHeart of Darkness  .\n Culture dictates that women are supposed to occupy positions of\n\ninferiority.\n Women were not supposed to be active, but docile and subservient in\n\ntheir social station.\n Two women, one\n\nfat and the other slim, sat on straw-bottomed chairs, knitting black wool.\n\n The slim one got up and walked straight at me - still knitting with\n\ndowncast eyes - and only just as I began to think of getting out of her way,\n\nas you would for a somnambulist, stood still, and looked up. ( Conrad, 1765)\n\n \n Women are sleepwalkers who go through the motions of performing their\n\nassigned roles.\n There is no real thought involved for culture dictates how to act.\n The women fulfil only serving positions in which they keep their\n\nculturally assigned roles of domesticity and complacency; they are serving\n\nmen but also knitting with their eyes downcast, showing their inferiority.\n\n\n\n  These culturally assigned roles do not only apply to women but to\n\nthe business class:  When near the buildings I met a white man, in\n\nsuch an unexpected elegance of get-up that in the first moment I took him for\n\na sort of vision. \n I saw a high starched collar, white cuffs, a light alpaca jacket,\n\nsnowy trouser, a clear necktie, and varnished boots.\n No hat.\n Hair parted, brushed, oiled, under a green-lined parasol held in a\n\nbig white hand.\n (\n\nConrad, 1771)\n Culture, even in remote Africa, imposes that the accountant be\n\nclean-cut and professional; he is to look and act like a businessman.\n Culture suppresses the individual to act in ways which are considered\n\nto be civilized and consistent with the values expressed by the society. \n\n  Yeats depicts this suppression with his symbolic representation\n\nof the falcon.\n The falcon represents the wild and uninhibited nature of society.\n However, culture as the falconer, has served to suppress the society\n\nand controls its actions.\n Nevertheless, these constraints are overturned and the falcon flies\n\nbeyond the range of the falconer ( Yeats, 1880). \n\n  texts foretell of the downfall\n\nof culture; how social norms will no longer be able to suppress the\n\nindividual.\n It is a shift from civility back to savagery.\n Conrad expresses the overturning of culture with Marlow\'s journey\n\nthrough the heart of darkness where he meets Kurtz.\n Kurtz is a physical embodiment of society, representative of the\n\nstranglehold culture has on the individual.\n It is Kurtz who overturns the social norms in favour of his\n\ninstinctual drives and desires.\n Kurtz is sent to Africa to determine how to suppress the African\n\nsavages:  All Europe contributed to the making of  \n\n Kurtz   ; and by and by I learned that, most appropriately, the\n\nInternational Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs had entrusted him\n\nwith the making of a report, for its future guidance.  ( Conrad,\n\n1795)\n However, while travelling through the heart of darkness Kurtz finds a\n\nfreedom from the constraints of society and realizes that he is like the\n\nsavages he is required to civilize.\n He finds an affiliation between his inner self and the rites and\n\nrituals of the native peoples; they reawaken his suppressed desires.\n Kurtz sums up the effect of his, and the natives, suppression when he\n\ncries;  " The Horror! The Horror!"  ( Conrad, 1811).\n Kurtz realizes that in trying to civilize the African savages western\n\nculture is denying their instinctual nature.\n "\n\nExterminate all the brutes!"  ( Conrad, 1796), because to civilize\n\nthe natives would be denying their drives and desires and, in so doing, would\n\nkill them.\n Kurtz also realizes that culture has had the same detrimental effect\n\non society.\n\n\n  Marlow, still closely tied to the social norms doesn\'t seem to\n\nrealize the efftecs of suppression and therefore can not understand Kurtz\'s\n\nhorror:  He had summed up - he had judged. \n \'The horror!\'\n He was a remarkable man.\n After all, this was the expression of some sort of belief; it had\n\ncandour, it had conviction, it had a vibrating note of revolt in its whisper,\n\nit had the appalling face of a glimpsed truth - the strange commingling of\n\ndesire and hate ... he had made that last stride, he had stepped over the\n\nedge, while I had been permitted to draw back my hesitating foot.\n And perhaps in this is the whole difference; perhaps all the wisdom,\n\nand all the truth, and all the sincerity, are just compressed into that\n\ninappreciable moment of time in which we step over the threshold of the\n\ninvisible.   ( Conrad, 1811-2)\n However, Marlow does realize that Kurtz has struck upon a truth while\n\nsequestered in the heart of darkness, a place of savagery without the\n\nrestraint of culture.\n\n\n Kurtz   realize how culture has slowly been destroying him, it\n\nhas been suppressing his drives and desires. \n\n  Yeats also foretells of the destructive nature of society\'s\n\nnorms:  Things fall apart, the center cannot hold; \\ Mere anarchy is\n\nloosed upon the world, \\ The blood-dimmed tide is loosed ...  (\n\nYeats, 1880)\n Society is suffering a cataclysm at the realization of its\n\nsuppression.\n The norms are falling apart.\n Culture, the centre, can no longer suppress the savage and therefore\n\nthe social norms begin to fall apart.\n People begin to revolt against their suppressor.\n " The ceremony of\n\ninnocence is drowned"  ( Yeats, 1880).\n The baptismal nature of passing on society\'s norms to the children\n\nthrough socialization and culture, has come to an end.\n No longer will people teach their children to be civilized but to\n\nfollow their instinctual desires.\n " The best lack\n\nall conviction, while the worst \\ Are full of passionate intensity" \n\n( Yeats, 1880).\n Those people who have completely suppressed their savage desires\n\nbecome complacent.\n They will follow the social values and are therefore viewed as the\n\nbest.\n The worst are those individuals who have not bowed to the social\n\nnorms.\n They still have a freedom and intensity of drives and desires; a will\n\nother than society\'s.\n By realizing how social norms have served to suppress the individual\n\ninto civility, the society revolts against the suppressor and again returns\n\nto its savage instincts. \n\n  Culture is facing an overturning.\n Society will no longer suppress its drives and desires.\n It is returning to its savage roots.\n , Kurtz is the messiah of\n\nthis second coming.\n Kurtz, realizing his suppression, gives over to his savage desires.\n Marlow, representing civilized western society, sees this as a type\n\nof insanity:  But this must have been before his - let us say - nerves\n\nwent wrong, and caused him to preside at certain midnight dances ending with\n\nunspeakable rites, which - as far as I reluctantly gathered from what I heard\n\nat various times - were offered up to him - do you understand? - to Mr. Kurtz\n\nhimself.  ( Conrad, 1796)\n Kurtz finds an affilitaion between his inner self and the rites and\n\nrituals of these native peoples.\n He, in fact, seems to become their leader, a messiah; instead of\n\ntrying to suppress the savages, he joins them. \n\n  Marlow, although he does not give up his civility, begins to see\n\nthe effects of suppression when he returns home:  I had a vision of\n\nhim on the stretcher, opening his mouth voraciously, as if to devour all the\n\nearth with all its mankind. \n He lived then before me; he lived as much as he had ever lived ...\n The vision seemed to enter the house with me ...\n It was a moment of triumph for the wilderness, an invading and\n\nvengeful rush which, it seemed to me, I would have to keep back alone for the\n\nsalvation of another soul ... while I waited he seemed to stare at me out of\n\nthe glossy panel - stare with that wide and immense stare embracing,\n\ncondemning, loathing all the universe.\n\n\n ( Conrad, 1813-4)\n Only when he returns to cultured society does Marlow realize how\n\nKurtz, although believed to be crazy, had struck upon a simple truth.\n Marlow realizes the constraining effects of culture, yet he\n\nsuppresses this knowledge with his other savage instincts.\n long\n\npassage from text  \n Marlow, realizing he is no longer like the rest of society, as he\n\nperceives his and its suppression, must accept the savage desires which are\n\ninherent within him.\n He can no longer suppress his savage instincts; yet, instead of\n\nreturning to them like Kurtz, he hides his desires in fear of ridicule from\n\nthe rest of society.\n Kurtz is able to accept his desires because he is placed in a\n\nsurrounding of savagery, whereas Marlow can only choose to forget his desires\n\nbecause he is surrounded by people following the social norms.\n However, Marlow looks with contempt on the complacency of the people\n\nwho surround him. \n\n  " Surely\n\nsome revelation is at hand; \\ Surely the Second Coming is at hand.  \\ The\n\nSecond Coming!"   ( Yeats, 1881).\n He foretells of the overturning of civility:\n Hardly are those words out \\ When a vast image out of\n\nSpiritus Mundi \\ Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert \\ A\n\nshape with lion body and the head of a man, \\ A gaze blank and pitiless as\n\nthe sun, \\ Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it \\ Reel shadows of\n\nthe indignant desert birds.  ( Yeats, 1881)\n The sphinx is used as a symbol for savagery; a mix of man, the head\n\nand mind, with a lion, a wild beast.\n The two become intertwined to form one being, dominated by the\n\nsavage.\n The turning of the gyre ( Yeats, 1880), has produced a second coming\n\nof savagery;  " its hour come round at last"  ( Yeats, 1881).\n Individuals will no longer suppress their drives and desires to\n\nsatisfy the social norms. \n\n  Western society is spiralling towards destruction.\n The catalyst of this destruction is culture.\n No longer will the savage instincts inherent in society be\n\nsuppressed by the social norms.\n These savage drives and desires are eliminated by imposing culture\n\nto make people civilized and complacent, as seen in Conrad\'s  Heart of\n\nDarkness  .\n However, these social norms are being overturned, and eliminated in\n\nfavour of a return to savagery as in   The Second Coming\n\n .\n Both of these texts foretell of the revolution from civility and\n\ncomplacency back to savagery.\n They sketch a complete overturning of the social norms dictating how\n\nto act and feel, in favour of the savage instinctual nature which drives the\n\nhuman race.\n\n\nYeats\'   The Second Coming  are texts which have been culturally\n\ninfluenced, but function to draw attention to the suppression of the\n\nindividual and how the social norms instilled by culture should be overturned\n\nfor a return and release of savagery; individuals and society should no\n\nlonger be suppressed by their culture.  \n###From , 2nd text\n\n\n\n  Gatsby becomes illusioned by his exonerable possessions, he\n\nbelieves his possessions will get him everything he wants out of life,\n\nincluding companionship and friendship.\n true friends is seen\n\nat his parties, where his fickle guests are either gossiping about each other\n\nor Gatsby himself.\n The shallowness of his friends is confirmed at his funeral, where\n\nnobody shows up.\n Nick in his attempts to get all of Gatsby\'s friends together failed\n\nmiserably as all of these so called friends said they had prior arrangements\n\nand would therefore be unable to attend the funeral.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '761b8a2e-0188-4968-8bab-fa7fc099db2d', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.695319+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9723552465438843, 'non_english_score': 0.027644753456115723}

there is a\n\ndramatic context that has already begun.\n The silent auditor is a man from the Estate of a family who wants\n\ntheir daughter to marry the Duke.\n\n\nunclear word </unclear>  monologue.\n This second element is clearly illustrated in another dramatic\n\nmonologue, John Donne\'s " The Flea".\n the outcome of the\n\npoem    and   the\n\ncourse of the speaker\'s argument.\n unclear\n\nword </unclear>  seen in " My Last Duchess".\n The Duke presents himself as an art connoiseur, a man of fine taste.\n unclear word\n\n</unclear>  especially those in the parentheses  , we see\n\nthat he is a    possessive   ,  sly man who knows  exactly \n\nwhat he\'s doing    and \n\n saying.\n He presents a humble man, unaware of what is happening, but we learn\n\nthat he knew  what happened ( or what he \n\nthought  happened)    and\n\n  he knows how to bait this other family into not letting it happen\n\nagain.\n It was his possessive desire to control his wife that led him to\n\nmurder her.\n\n\n<unclear> unclear word </unclear>  . \n\n  Conrad\'s quote exemplifies the attitude taken by many writers in\n\nmany periods, toward women.\n specific worlds for women,\n\nand specific worlds for men is characteristic of a belief in inferiority and\n\nsuperiority of the sexes.\n Women are inferior and men are superior.\n\n\nand   low is demonstrated in several works.\n During different periods ( specifically, the Renaissance, the 19th\n\ncentury, and the 20th century) different approaches are taken, but the same\n\nresult is achieved.\n in a lower space.\n that we begin to see a\n\nway out of that low space. \n\n  During the Renaissance, the typical way of portraying women was\n\nthrough the Petrarchan sonnet.\n This traditional mode is seen in Sir Philip Sidney\'s " Astrophil and\n\nStella", a very  typical sonnet sequence.\n We see the attitude towards women in certain conventions.\n The first convention is seen in the title of this work, which means\n\nstar-gazer and star.\n Immediately, the convention of man gazing upon the unattainable woman\n\nis seen.\n\n\nchaste, pure unattainable woman shows typical attitudes toward women.\n It would seem that the male poet, Sidney, is elevating his female\n\nlove object.\n He does this through conceits.\n But, Petrarchan conceits compare on a one-to-one physical level.\n By doing so, as we saw in Sidney\'s blazon of comparing Stella to a\n\nhouse, the woman remains an object to be looked at.\n the fire of\n\nhis desire, and the ice of her chastity  ( Norton Intro.), he remains\n\nthe subject - the \'I\' - that has control over the \'you\' - the object.\n He claims that the woman has power over him - by her great beauty, he\n\nis rendered slave, - but, in fact he has power over her, because he is in\n\ncontrol of the gaze on the object.\n This attitude that women are so beautiful and unattainable actually\n\nserves to oppress women, as they are reduced to roses and stars - physical\n\nobjects that should be gazed upon by men. \n\n  This oppositional mode of thinking is seen in works during the\n\n19th century.\n The notion of high and low is evidently seen in Alfred, Lord\n\nTennyson\'s " The Lady of    Shalott   " .\n This poem is typical of the Victorian era.\n There is a return to the myths of medieval romances that portray\n\nwomen as \'damsels in distress\'.\n save\n\nthem.\n takes\n\ntraditional assumptions and  makes it clear that the\n\nreader recognizes them and makes the right association.\n Men are associated with light, culture, and superiority, which the\n\nreader is supposed to  see as good.\n Women, on the other hand, are associated with dark, domesticity,\n\ndocility, and inferiority.\n These clues show that women are bad and need to be saved by the\n\ngood.\n\n\nand  shadows  .\n glimmering\n\n ,  bright  , and  light   .\n This attitude Tennyson takes toward women is that they should remain\n\nin their own sequestered spaces. \n\n  The fact that these oppositional modes rely on the inferior to\n\nkeep the superior, superior is seen in Virginia Woolf\'s " A Room of One\'s\n\nOwn".\n In this work, which is a compilation of two addresses she made to\n\ngroups of young women, Woolf explores what she calls a  looking glass\n\nidentify  .\n She states that in order to keep men feeling superior, they make\n\nwomen inferior.\n ( as\n\nexemplified in the quotation in the question) with women and  racial inferiority.\n The top needs the bottom to hold itself up.\n Woolf goes on to say that patriarchy, man\'s control over woman, is\n\nin all of us.\n We feed off of it like drug addicts off their heroine.\n Without it we would fall, and our whole notion of culture would be\n\ndestroyed.\n as\n\nYeats said.\n As Woolf acknowledges this, she goes on to offer a solution.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '74a12047-05b5-41e5-a9a7-0ba3c4bcdbcf', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.696682+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9770951867103577, 'non_english_score': 0.022904813289642334}
{'text': 'A Room of One\'s Own\n\n .\n It is a significant quote in that she gives the art of storytelling\n\nmore credibility <unclear> unclear word or punctuation </unclear> meaning\n\nthat fact itself.\n What she proposes is that the \'little\' stories about women will be the\n\none\'s that carry the most meaningful and hence be more  \n\n insightful   to their condition. \n\n \n\nLyrrical   Lyrical   Ballads  .\n It is a significant quote in that it describes his method of creating\n\npoetry.\n He was a strong believer in the process of delaying one\'s thought\n\nuntil a later time.\n He claimed that after\n\n quality thinking  on something ( an  idea)  one day you will  just be hit\n\n with how to write it down, hence the spontaneity. \n\n  This is from William Shakespeare, and is found within his play The\n\nTempest.\n It is significant on that they are discussing the change of human\n\ncharacter.\n A person who dies at\n\nsea, experiences this sea change and their whole character changes.\n\n\n  The Flea\n\n .\n It is significant in that the male narrator in the poem is using the\n\nflea  ( which just bit each of them) as a mean\'s of persuading\n\nhis new wife to have sex with him.\n He claims that it would be a small progression to do so, since their\n\nblood has already been mixed within this flea. \n\n  This is a quote from Alexander Pope\'s The Rape of the Lock.\n It is an important one in that it is Clarissa, another woman who does\n\nthe \'dirty deed\' of cutting Belinda\'s hair.\n unclear word\n\n</unclear>  jealousy, as she perceives Belinda as the \'spoiled brat\'\n\nand deserving.\n\n\n  in her\n\nnovel Thinking About Magritte.\n\n\ncharacters  all seem to be wanting a change in their life.\n character in her novel ( Cowboy?) was in the water and\n\nclaimed  things are not so heavy here  ( that we wanted to\n\nstay).\n of\n\n misery and anything else would be a progression. \n\n \n\nand is very important for a critical understanding of the  world  .\n When Lizzie brings her sister the fruit ( on her fare) from the\n\nGoblin Men, she saves her sister\'s life.\n It can be understood as a promotion of siblings getting along or more\n\ndeeply as  the notion that men\n\ncannot help you, but another woman can. \n\n  I believe this quote comes from the movie we watched " The\n\nForbidden Planet".\n It was important in that it gave an explanation to the origins of the\n\nBeast; that it came from within us.\n\n\nconciousness   consciousness   as the Dr. did within this\n\nmovie.\n The Tempest.\n\n\n\n  This is a quote by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu in her work " The\n\nLover".\n It is significant in that she is telling a man that she is interested\n\nin sex, but that she does not want to become pregnant.\n In doing so she would face childbirth ( death perhaps), and the\n\nraising of the children.\n She knows how short life can be and simply sees this pleasure as not\n\nbeing worth the threat of her life, desires. \n\n  that this is from T.S. Eliot\'s " The\n\nWasteland".\n It would be significant to the text in that he sees society as being\n\nsomehow depressed, but capable of coming out of it should they choose to do\n\nso.\n Like Wordsworth, he believes the power to do so is with the poet,\n\nhence he asks if  I shall at least set my lands in order?  .\n\n\n\n\n  The use of dramatic monologue is such that in\n\ndoing so, the author achieves a significant effect in comparison to other\n\nmethods.\n It is important to note that a dramatic monologue has 3 constituent\n\nelements to it.\n The first of these is the requirement of a NARRATOR.\n The narrator is writing within the first person and while doing so is\n\nNOT the author of the work.\n in\n\nmedias res  ( already in progress) and hence we rely on the\n\nnarrator for information in terms of plot, setting, etc.\n The second criteria is a SILENT AUDITOR, a character that remains\n\nsilent throughout but who\'s actions can be deduced from the narrator\'s words.\n\n\n the one who is being addressed throughout the work.\n Lastly, there must be an UNINTENTIONAL REVELATION, whereby the reader\n\ngains insight into the story where the narrator would rather not have insight\n\nknown.\n Again, it is deduced by the narrator\'s words, and can often appear to\n\nbe a " slip of the tongue" of sorts \n\n  A work where all 3 of these criteria are met, is Robert\n\nBrowning\'s My Last Duchess.\n narrator is the Duke who is showing a\n\nprospective father in law around his house.\n The man he is talking to hence is the silent auditor.\n killed\n\n his last wife ( Duchess) for being too promiscuous -  how shall\n\nI say, easily made happy  .\n\n\nunconciously  is drawn back to the act, and he recollects his feelings.\n He never blatantly reveals the fact that he killed her but you know\n\nit from his words. \n\n \n\nmonologue for the reader to get a different outlook on his character.\n We learn of his intense pride for his 900 year old name, and the\n\nextent to which he will go to preserve it.\n\n\n  Writers often use their works as vehicles with which to criticize\n\nthe standards and values of the societies in which they live.\n indeed\n\ncorrect, and that it can be substantiated with reference to three different\n\nauthors.\n I will use the works of Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope and Thomas\n\nMore in doing so. \n\n  the foremost leader of all the\n\nauthors we studied in terms of social criticism.\n This is not to say that it is only his work that takes a strong\n\nposition, but rather that it takes the strongest.\n His piece titled " A Modest Proposal" is a direct criticism to the\n\noppression of the Irish upon their culture.\n Through the use of satire, Swift\'s work calls out for political\n\naction by the people to fight back.\n Very brilliantly composed, Swift\'s proposal is to actually have the\n\nchildren of their society killed and sold for meat to wealthy families (\n\nthose that he perceives to be oppressors).\n\n\n    well-defined, thought out, and calculated\n\nto the last detail.\n establishing this\n\ncold, calculated  plan to have the children sold for meat,\n\nSwift makes his reader actually put credibility into what they are being\n\ntold.\n Despite the fact that it is extremely inhumane, the whole process of\n\ngiving human life a dollar value, not to mention that it is cannibalism. \n\n  However, Swift points out the advantages to such a system.\n He claims that instead of being a burden to their families, and\n\nstarving to death anyway, they could actually create some profit for these\n\neconomically-ravished people.\n So, instead of feeding them and raising them, they could be sold off\n\nfor a good price at the appropriate time.\n It is not until one sits back and looks at what he is actually\n\nproposing that you realize how barbaric it really is.\n Such is the depth and quality of the satire Swift creates.\n states that adults in\n\nthe society would have been thankful for such a system when they were\n\nchildren.\n In this way Swift describes the severity of the conditions people are\n\nliving in.\n Perhaps Swift\'s best tool in capturing the reader is the dependence\n\non the cold-calculated efficiency of the whole proposal. \n\n  Another social critique of his time was Alexander Pope.\n However, where Swift\'s satire is very serious-oriented and is a call\n\nfor political action, Pope\'s work is there to simply point out a problem that\n\nhe sees within society, primarily the way of women.\n Pope\'s main piece of literature in accomplishing this is " The Rape\n\nof the Lock" which has obvious implications to explain the nature of women.\n It has often been claimed of Pope within this work that he is simply\n\nmaking a mountain out of a mole hill, and to a large degree this is true.\n As previously stated, Pope is not interested in taking on this "\n\nproblem" as he sees it, but rather to just  laugh at the little\n\nunguarded follies of women   . \n\n  In order to accomplish this task, Pope uses irony to some degree.\n\n\nClarissa, it was while they were playing cards.\n Ironically, Belinda has a sprite of whose purpose is to protect her\n\nchasteness and purity.\n While Clarissa is doing the cutting, Belinda ironically is thinking\n\nof unchaste, impure thoughts and hence her protector ( the sprite Ariel)\n\ncannot save her from her fate.\n Hence, it could be deduced from the work that women are in their\n\nstate due to their own choosing.\n\n\nmisogynist   and there is definitely grounds for support there.\n However, this is Pope\'s social criticism and must be examined for\n\nwhat it is. \n\n  Belinda\'s reaction to her hair being cut is one that is promoted\n\nas being highly out of proportion to the event, and in essence one of\n\nchildish behaviour.\n However, we do not take much sympathy as readers for her as it came\n\nfrom her own  unchaste thoughts.\n In addition, the character of Clarissa is also important.\n which\n\nalso instills a certain portrayal of women in society at the time.\n More importantly, though, she did it out of spite and jealousy.\n Belinda\'s wealth has come at the hands of profitting from the\n\nimperial colonization.\n not only of\n\nwomen\'s nature but that the colonial process / experience is wrong. \n\n  makes us\n\ncomplicit to all of the little \'inside jokes\', while at the same time\n\npointing out his criticisms of society. \n\n  The final author I will study ( or examine) is Thomas More.\n displays an ideal society\n\nas was experienced through the travels of a man called Hythloday.\n It is important to note, however that More was very disturbed at the\n\ncondition of his country, England, at the time of this book.\n What he does with Utopia then, is use the conception of an ideal\n\nsociety and compares it with that of England.\n In doing so, the actual problems he perceived would be magnified, and\n\nbetter exposed for those that read his work. \n\n  in an expedition by\n\na man called Hythloday ( which by definition means  teller of nonsense), and his discovery of an ideal society.\n Hythloday reveals to us that it is on an island, and in doing so\n\nproposes that perhaps such a system can only work in seclusion / isolation.\n It is in the shape of a crescent moon, and has a very good system of\n\ndefense from intruders.\n They operate under the principles of pure equality of citizens, with\n\nthe exception of the King ( Utopus).\n There are various and numerous other qualities about Utopia, such as\n\nthe fact that husband and wife get to see each other naked before they marry\n\nso as to not have an unhappy marriage.\n Again, these aspects of Utopia are numerous.\n The important thing to remember is that whatever More has brought up\n\nwithin his text, Utopia is related to a critique of his own regarding his own\n\nsociety.', 'subdomain':

a\n\nheroine because she goes outside of the female role in order to save her\n\nfamily.\n However, Lawson also maintains her sense of being the weaker sex as\n\nwell.\n by his mother.\n He is socialized enough to be aware of the separation between men\'s\n\nand woman\'s roles.\n He no longer considers his Mom as his hero, but rather, now,\n\nconsiders her as his equal.\n The younger child

The imposition of colonialism has covered over this culture.\n Now, it stands, isolated, in a museum to be mocked at.\n The colonial attitude of being superior to the culture which they\n\nwere attempting to destroy was their saving grace.\n This feeling of superiority had to be maintained in order to feel\n\nmorally right in \'civilizing\' the savages.\n The cultures of the aboriginal people must learn how to survive time\n\nby, perhaps, learning the trick of quietly being   \n\npreserved   , then quietly unfolding and being culturally reactivated\n\nwhen the time is right. \n\n  the\n\n many of the women in Of  Customs and Excise  are depicted as\n\nprofoundly different than the men which surround them.\n In both works the women are forced to move away\n\nfrom what they realize as the woman\'s place in society and to look back and\n\neither change themselves to become enlightened unto the fact that they are\n\nindividuals apart from their men or to realize their

she becomes pregnant as a\n\nresult of this affair and, therefore, pays the price the rest of her life.\n Her husband is unkind to her and to her daughter Maya.\n Parvati gives up her own freedom in order to give her daughter a\n\nchance that she, herself, never had. \n\n  Generally, the women are seen as much different than the men in\n\nthese two works because they are identified in regards to the men which\n\nsurround them.\n They live in a purely paternalistic world which, in itself, offers no\n\nfreedom to these women.\n The men, in contrast, are able to characterize themselves.\n In

given freedom to a certain extent.\n Her mother Parvati gives her an exit to the oppressive paternalistic\n\nHindu society.\n Parvati shoves money under Maya\'s door one evening giving her a way\n\nto move away from the home and to go to school.\n The modern Canadian society which Maya finds herself in, is much more\n\naccepting than the traditional Hindu household that she had grown up in.\n Like the other women, Maya had been described in terms of her Father\n\nand not in terms of herself.\n\n\n caught between two worlds, between the paternalistic oppressive Hindu\n\nworld and the western Canadian world.\n Her friends are Canadians who offer her a picture of the life she\n\ncould have if she could escape her Father.\n Parvati loves her daughter so much and believes her daughter should\n\nhave the chance to be defined on her own, and in her own terms.\n Maya takes this opportunity and for a while completely disregards her\n\nculture.\n However, she realizes how much her mother has been through and, in\n\nthe end, goes back  to comfort her, and to hold her\n\n even though she couldn\'t earlier, when she was still in\n\nParvati\'s womb. \n\n  These women, although with very different circumstances, are all\n\nrestrained because they live in a very paternalistic society.\n are particularly\n\nrelated to their ability to have male children.\n Their value is based

them, they\n\nnever are able, to  find an identity to\n\nthemselves without the interference of men.\n Perhaps the most positive image is of Maya, who, after much personal\n\nsuffering, is able to bridge the waters between her traditional    Hindu   culture, in order to help her Mother, and her new\n\nfound Western existence. \n\n\n  This poem provides the image of a Western woman in the midst

needed to cling to a husband like moss to a tree would not\n\nbe able to survive these conditions, yet Ellen does.\n On the other hand, Ellen, does move from man to man if one looks at\n\nher relations with Austin, her husband, then Garnet, her lover, Jack Chance,\n\nher rescuer, and Mr. Jevans, a potential love interest.\n This passage, said to her by Mrs. Oakes, applies to Ellen while she is\n\nback in civilization.\n The idea that a woman must depend on a man is imposed on her again\n\n when she comes back as it is likely she will get into a\n\nrelationship with Mr. Jevans.\n Ellen also needed a man to get back to civilisation, or else she\n\nbelieves so, as she says that Jack was her only way back to civilisation.\n But at other times in the novel, Ellen is compared to a

married to Mohan, Mrs.\n\nUngoli\'s son, 3 months ago.\n However, Dr. Bridget doesn\'t know this, and Dr. Naigar makes it clear\n\nto Dr. Bridget that she must take the whole situation into account, not only\n\nthe medical aspect of a situation.\n She is sarcastic because Dr. Bridget wants to insist that she is\n\nright, but Dr. Naigar points out that  she  is right in protecting\n\n Parvati.\n Although Dr. Bridget may tend to look down on the Indian doctor, she\n\ncannot, because Dr. Naigar knows some things she doesn\'t know. \n\n  This version of the Drover\'s Wife is the first one written.\n It tells the story of a woman who must protect her family while her\n\nhusband is    off   droving.\n It lists the things she must do as she becomes the man of the house.\n kills a snake,\n\nchases off a swagman, and in this passage, fights a fire.\n The fact that she is wearing trousers shows that she is indeed taking\n\nthe place of the man in the house.\n While her elder son laughs at this sight, her baby doesn\'t even\n\nrecognize her as  the baby truly just sees a man.\n The drover\'s wife becomes the " phallic man" in this story, or at\n\nleast she almost does.\n She still remains a woman in need in that she has the dog and her son\n\nTommy to help her with the beating of the snake.\n And in this passage the four bush men help her put out the fire.\n Since this

realize what the ceremony is truly about.\n A major theme in the novel is that while Fada doesn\'t understand the\n\naboriginals, they understand him.\n Jangamuttuk is not really scared of Fada, he does not end the\n\nceremony because he wants to listen to Fada\'s orders - he just stops to "\n\nhumour" him.\n It says he tensed then relaxed, he only tenses because he\'s not sure\n\nwho it is, but once Jangamuttuk sees it is Fada, he relaxes. \n\n  Of Customs and\n\nExcise  women are depicted as profoundly different from men, as living\n\nin a women\'s world of children, relationships, and

being a man when she puts on her husband\'s\n\ntrousers when fighting the fire.\n Rather than stepping into his shoes, she steps into his pants.\n It seems that the drover\'s wife has the best of both

a small coffin of a house where he lives\n\nalone waiting for death.\n This is all one can expect from fighting for the sake of empire.\n The poet asks who would weep for those who die in the service of\n\ntheir empire, and we must answer that  no one would weep for the passing of the empire ( or very few) but we\n\nshould weep for the senseless loss of young lives, so needlessly wasted.\n empty sleeve and emptiness is\n\nthe abiding emotion here.  \n\n\n\n \n\nare given more power and independence than the woman in " Drover\'s Wife".\n However, the portrayal of Asha, Mala, and Parvati is not necessarily\n\na better life.\n controlled\n\nlife by going the opposite way and sleeping with many men.\n although\n\nshe it is   to protect herself.\n Asha must resort to violence to remove the controlling aspect from\n\nher life.\n more control over their\n\n in  Of Customs and Excise  they still do\n\nnot have ideal lives, but realistically men  do not have\n\nideal lives either with the power they have. \n\n\n  The title of this poem is referring to the decline of the British\n\nEmpire.\n The Empire is passing on in that it is dying - countries that were\n\nonce a part of the empire are gaining independence, or have gained\n\nindependence.\n There is much death imagery in connection with Britain and the\n\nBritish pensioner.\n\n\nhe   his head is called a  grave  and his head is\n\nnot referred to as a head but as a  skull  which is how you\n\nwould describe a dead person\'s skeleton.\n\n\n  He fought in the African Campaign, which was when Britain took\n\nover countries of Africa.\n But he sees this fighting all done in vain since Britain hasn\'t\n\nretained control of their countries \n poem says Boys will still pour their blood out\n\nfor a    sieve   in that the fighting is useless,\n\n their  blood flows through a\n\n   sieve   and more blood of young boys will keep\n\non flowing through, all for nothing.\n could also be\n\nreferring to the countries of the former British Empire which have poured\n\nthrough and escaped British rule. \n\n  Another connection to the death imagery is the children\n\nironically singing Rule Britannia rule.\n because with this\n\nattitude they will be dead because Britain is no longer ruling,    its   time has passed.\n These children may also go on to fight in wars because they have this\n\nattitude and then they indeed will be dead. \n\n \n\n<unclear> unclear words </unclear>  boys will still fight.\n He has only one eye, yet he can a see and understand better than\n\nothers.\n The image of an empty sleeve is a reference to his missing arm, which\n\nis the toll war has taken on him, nevermind the missing eye as well.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '10b602c4-123a-4044-aab8-1b8bbac0fcd0', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.705747+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9846152067184448, 'non_english_score': 0.015384793281555176}

Lawson depicts the drover\'s wife as a very strong and independent\n\nwoman who is quite capable of taking care of herself and her children despite\n\nthe absence of her husband.\n She faces many hardships such as floods, wild animals, snakes and men\n\nwho might harm them, but there are very few, such as the fire, that might\n\nhave destroyed her without the help of others.\n This " Drover\'s

admiration. \n\n\n  A Fringe of Leaves\n\n , is used to draw attention to Ellen and her position as a woman.\n In the beginning, Ellen may cling to her\n\nhusband, Mr. Roxburgh, like moss to a rock

hands on the tussock that threatens to both entangle\n\nher and keep her in isolation, she  struggles to clear a\n\nspace to paint on, or a place and avenue for her to express herself.\n The title " Close-Up" suggests a first-hand viewpoint of a woman\n\nstruggling to express her art, or a picture of a single person seen from a\n\nvery short distance, but that is usually indicative of a great number of\n\npeople or a certain point of time ( e.g. The Mona Lisa). \n\n  The idea of the impression of the unknowability of others seems\n\nto be a common theme in much Commonwealth literature.\n The Man-Eater of\n\nMalgudi  , Dr. Bridget\'s maid in Rachna Mara\'s  Of Customs and\n\nExcise  , and Ellen Roxborough in Patrick White\'s  A Fringe of\n\nLeaves  , all have a certain degree of unknowability to others.\n\n\nauthor in a different way, for different reasons, and has a different effect\n\nfor the reader. \n\n  The Man-Eater of\n\nMalgudi  , has a large degree of unknowability because the reader knows\n\nonly as much as the narrator shares through the experiences of Nataraj.\n The reader is forced to assume some of Vasu\'s motives and reasons for\n\nhis actions, which Nataraj often fails to see for himself.\n This device forces the reader to want to interact with the novel, and\n\nto prompt Nartaraj into taking direct action against Vasu.\n However, the more passive and seemingly ignorant Nataraj is, the more\n\nthe reader is drawn into Narayan\'s ploy.\n\n\ninformation about Vasu is to force this reaction from the reader, and cause\n\nreaders to become frustrated and expectant of Nataraj\'s inevitable triumph\n\nover Vasu.\n This creates an irony, because it not only confirms the readers\n\nsuspicions about Vasu\'s evil motives  , and Nataraj\'s tendency to be too trusting of others, but provides\n\nthe major theme of the book, which is passivity versus direct action in the\n\nresolution of conflicts.\n As it becomes apparent that Nataraj is powerless against Vasu\'s\n\ncunning, guns, and use of the law, readers can empathize with his situation\n\nand lack of action somewhat.\n accidentally kills himself\n\nduring his attempt to kill the elephant, Narayan manages to convey his theme\n\nof non-intervention and non-violence.\n This seems to incorporate Narayan\'s social, political and religious\n\nphilosophy, that there is no need for direct action and violence because\n\neverything is pre-determined and will turn out for the best.\n about\n\nVasu extends from the use of narrator to express a prominent them. \n\n  , there is a\n\ngreat degree of unknowability between Dr. Bridget and her maid.\n By using free indirect discourse, we get an impression of both\n\ncharacters from the  point of view, as each narrates.\n For example, Dr. Bridget believes she is adapting as best as she can,\n\nespecially when it comes to  washroom customs.\n She has a basically western washroom set up, despite the lack of\n\nrunning water.\n However, from her maid\'s point of view, she is appalled by Dr.\n\nBridget\'s toileting habits.\n She cannot believe that she uses toilet paper, rather that water, and\n\nthat she does not know which hand to eat with and which hand is used to\n\ncleanse the body.\n The constant unknowing of each other\'s motives functions to create\n\nsuspicion between them, to later be reconciled.\n It also functions to expose the underlying cause of their suspicions,\n\nmainly being language and custom differences which they do not understand\n\nabout each other. \n\n  readers\n\nsee both sides to the same story or event.\n This allows the reader to understand that neither character is wrong,\n\nbut simply has a different perspective.\n Therefore, most of the problems they have are due to a lack of\n\ncommunication and / or understanding.\n By making this apparent to the reader, Mara exposes this as a major\n\nfactor in racism, and therefore may undermine it. \n\n  The unknowingness between Ellen and Austin Roxburgh in Patrick\n\nWhite\'s  A Fringe of Leaves  is conveyed through their general lack\n\nof communication, and through their treatment of each other.\n Ellen treats Austin as though she were merely his nurse, and he\n\ntreats her in much the same way.\n He has no idea she has been unfaithful to him with his brother, yet\n\nsenses that something is wrong.\n By comparing Ellen\'s and Austin\'s vantage points, the reader\n\nunderstands the type of relationship they have, and how little they\n\nunderstand of each other.\n It is ironic that the reader knows why he is anguished, and feels\n\npity for him, as he is sickly and seems to live only vicariously through\n\nbooks.\n This functions to compare their versions, as hers is written very\n\nmuch from a woman\'s perspective and his from a man\'s.\n Later, however, the change in Ellen as she is shipwrecked and living\n\nwith an island tribe, shows a marked change in her.\n For once, she doesn\'t subserve her own needs to the needs of Austin\n\nor to be proper.\n\n\n  The device of unknowability of certain characters is employed by\n\nsome authors in Commonwealth literature.\n It is employed in different ways, whether by\n\nwithholding information, or by contrasting narrators  .\n It is used for different reasons, such as to lead the reader to a new\n\nperspective,  such as passivity versus\n\ndirect action in resolving conflicts, to undermine racism with understanding\n\nand communication, or to see the progression of a character.  \n\n\n\n  and\n\nManfield\'s " At the Bay",

{'text': 'A woman, as I see it, is more like moss or lichen ... as\n\nshe takes to her husband.  \n\n  , this phrase\n\nspoken by Ellen near the end of the novel is something I believe she picked\n\nup from her friend when she first escaped the bush.\n The essence of the phrase is that women cling to men as a source of\n\ntheir identity.\n\n\n herself as either Mrs Roxborough or Ellen Gluyas: this distinction in\n\nEllen\'s mind illustrates that it is society that makes a woman defined\n\nthrough her husband as can be well illustrated in Ellen\'s loyal clinging to\n\nher marriage through the carrying of her wedding ring.\n\n\nlife is significant as Ellen is    dependent \n\n on nature for survival and her fringe of leaves to keep her \'decent\'.\n\n\n\n\n  Lamming\'s short story " A Wedding in Spring" has a great deal to\n\nsay about cultural differences.\n This passage is right at the beginning of the story, creating an\n\nimmediate contrast between these " foreigners" to London.\n A theme of several of the stories this term is learning about the \'colonizer\'\n\ncountry.\n Flo, Beresford, Knickerbock and Snooker experience London at\n\nBeresford\'s wedding to a white girl at different levels.\n Flo is torn between her love for her brother and a loyalty to her\n\nculture.\n She resents that Beresford is marrying a white woman and attempts to\n\n   sabotage   the wedding.\n\n\nlondoners   Londoners   a great wedding.\n This difference in perception of the city of London creates cultural\n\nconflict between one who would be assimilated and accepted ( Beresford) and\n\nhis sister who wished to maintain her cultural identity. \n\n\n  This early bi-play between Jangamuttuk and Fada defines their\n\nrelationship in terms of appearances and of control.\n Fada is shown to be the one who thinks he has control but the natives\n\nare the ones who control him.\n Both Jangamuttuk and Ludgee are able to manipulate the \'ghosts\' as is\n\nillustrated in a kind of seeming    acquiescence\n\n  of power:  \'About to boss\' Jangamuttuk said humouring him\n\n .\n is something of free and direct\n\ndiscourse (  humouring him  ) hints that it is the master\n\nmanipulator Jangamuttuk that will triumph in the end.\n They certainly trick Sonny in the end and escape through a sort of\n\npassive resistance that undermines the \'ghosts\'. \n\n\n  This passage between Naigar and Bridget is an example of the\n\ntension between the two doctors and their different methods.\n Naigar is resentful of Bridget and many times attempts to humble her.\n This passage contains also different grammar to show a language\n\ndifference  We peasants are knowing a few things also  Naigar\n\npoints out that it is  peasants  that the novel deals with\n\nrather than the rich.\n Characters such as Parvati and Asha are examples of women that the\n\ndoctors interact with and this passage empowers  peasants  as\n\nknowledgeable and able to be successful. \n\n\n  The Lawson " Drover\'s Wife" treats the wife as out of her element\n\nin a number of incidents.\n Lawson only enables her to a certain degree then diffuses her power.\n The men in this story ( and particularly this passage: Tommy) are\n\ndepicted as heroic.\n The Drover\'s wife fights the blaze as best\n\nshe can but it is the bush men who save her.\n She seems strong sometimes but Lawson always ends up making her cry\n\nor break down as in the example of the dam breaking.\n Certainly the snake is killed but it is her fault that he is there\n\nand the dog helps.\n his mother as\n\nsomewhat helpless in the end and says he\'ll always stay: basically to protect\n\nher. \n\n\n  The language used in this passage is a key to the inability of\n\nAnancy to understand the  Land of Billboards  .\n There is a cultural reference to lashes and punishment.\n This comments on the aggressive nature of the Land of Billboards.\n the\n\n forgetting forgiving side of him life  and in many ways one\n\ncan interpret this as weakness but perhaps what Salkey is getting at is the\n\nperceptions in his story is of one who cannot understand his surroundings and\n\nis doing his utmost to cope: even becoming white. \n\n  Ellen Roxborough and Mala can be compared as two distinct and\n\ndifferent characters through the traits of Passion, Power and Fertility.\n A comparison between\n\nEllen and Austin and Mala and her father enhances these three traits as\n\ndifferences between the genders. \n\n  Passion is a quality that both Ellen and Mala have, Ellen\n\nsuppresses her passion so aggressively for the first half of the novel, only\n\nhints of it indicate it is there.\n\n\nrigid   invalid, she is unable to express her passion in the face of\n\ndisgrace before her husband.\n Ellen escapes the passionless surroundings by racing through the\n\nforest on horseback.\n Her passion is most obvious when White refers to her as Ellen Gluyas.\n This former self greatly contrasts the Mrs. Roxborough self who is\n\n   dependent   on her husband and must out of\n\nduty protect him from a judging society.\n\n\nthe man I call father  .\n\n\n  independent   .\n Mala\'s father resists Canadian society and is very concerned with the\n\nIndian community.\n The contrast of these two individuals, Father and daughter show how\n\ntwo very strong characters become alienated from one another due to genders (\n\nhe was not so concerned about his sons) and power issues\n Where Mala\'s passion led her to empowerment and success, Ellen\'s led\n\nher through many mental trials.\n\n\n through her rescue by Jack.\n More important to the actual passionate acts is the circumstances\n\nwhich led to them.\n Ellen, without her husband, reduced to a slave was subject to almost\n\nan animal state, scavenging and once being   \n\ncannibalistic   .   ( *not\n\nnecessarily the view of this writer) \n This state as White portrays it is of the savage animal-like natives\n\nwho capture Ellen.\n The men and women of these tribes are definitely different: Men are\n\nwarriors, women domestic. \n\n  Where Ellen is reduced to savagery through the loss of social\n\npower of her community, Mala gains    independence\n\n  from her escape from her father\'s home.\n Mala\'s father is often portrayed as an unforgiving, evil character\n\nwho deserves to be reduced to a coma state and death in the end.\n Mara, portrays\n\nthe father as a demon,  exacting punishment, unfair\n\nrules and even being a lecherous man in bed with his wife, Parvati.\n Because Mala escapes into the world ( with her mother\'s money) she is\n\nable to establish herself and have a family. \n\n  Mala is portrayed as being fertile, like her mother, able to have\n\nhealthy children.\n Ellen is portrayed as being infertile and therefore inferior.\n The longing Ellen has for children is never fulfilled.\n Ellen wants to please Austin by bearing him children, it is true, but\n\nmore importantly she wants someone to love unconditionally.\n Many times, Ellen attempts to find this love through young Oswald,\n\nthrough Jack and through the Lovell children but she is never truly\n\nsatisfied.\n Jack is the closest she comes to finding a passionate relationship\n\nbut it falls short in terms of societal acceptability.\n demote\n\nher in her own mind and reduce her further in society.\n Because women are domestic in both the societies Ellen lives in the\n\ndeath of her diseased  ward  is yet another instance of her failure.\n Ellen\'s relationship with Mr R. is a nurturing one, Ellen enduring a\n\ngreat deal ( passionless sex for one) for the sake of duty.\n Because she is unable to perform the duty of having children she\n\nfeels    unfulfilled   .\n in her\n\nchild is evident because of her happiness with her husband and ability to\n\nmutually experience the joy of a family.\n Parvati can be very strongly contrasted with Mohan to exhibit great\n\ngender differences, Mala and her white husband have more of an equal\n\nrelationship.\n for\n\n for her husband, rather a beautiful part of a loving relationship.\n Children for Mohan and Parvati was a duty rather than an act of love.\n It was this duty that Dr. Bridget was able to play upon to help\n\nParvati escape her strong father in-law. \n\n \n\n  Power, Passion and fertility are elements which illuminate the\n\nmajor characters in  A Fringe of Leaves  and of  Custom and \n\n  Excise    .\n Ellen and Mala are two very different characters from different times\n\nbut both are subjected to many of the same social stigmas. \n\n\n  This poem seems very concerned with nature.\n The poem itself is almost a painting of a scene in nature.\n creeps across the sky\n\n is very ominous, very    aggressive \n\n .\n She tussles,\n\nshe tugs at the earth. \n This fighting with nature seems to represent a struggle.\n The woman wishes to paint the scene but has to manipulate her\n\nsurroundings in order to do so.\n The further contrast to the woman and her surroundings is that she is\n\ninside the sunhat rather than simply wearing it.\n This oppression of clothing may signify the hat blocking her\n\nperspective or perhaps even clothing as an element of western culture imposes\n\non her metaphorically showing her struggle with her surroundings rather than\n\na compliance to it.\n The fact that this poem is a " close up" and does not reveal a great\n\ndeal may comment  on the masking of this woman    through   her enormous hat and her actions.  \n\n\n\n <0> rest of paragraph <0>\n Linda is upset because she does not have another choice in life,\n\nmeaning

not very exciting and quite expensive.\n for shower either.\n\n\n and   were met by  Jack     and  \n\n Magdalena  ( I felt as if I had known them for years) whom  Rosie\n\n refers to ( and rightly) as the Hollywoods. \n\n  It is larger than the one she had last time she was here, but it\n\nsure needed a <unclear> unclear word </unclear> out.\n and\n\n  we needed ( actually  Rose  did all that work - I dusted\n\nwhat is the living room    and   tidied up) a shovel\n\nto clear it out.\n\n\n carries on as usual.\n She\'s a great person to travel with and we are very loose about\n\nstepping in this shop or that one    and   look\n\naround    and   both of us go into postcard frenzies\n\nand go a little mad in souvenir shops. \n\n \n\nRose  has run into on the street and in the restaurants that she knows.\n More than what would happen in Vancouver - that\'s for sure.\n I think people who live around the Plaka tend to run into each other\n\nquite often.\n It\'s sort of like a passing parade.\n\n\n  flea\n\nmarket area - picked up a few things  Rosie  needed for the suite -\n\ngathered a few gifts for my grandchildren- and ate in McDonalds ( we really\n\ndid).\n Then we got caught in a terrible downpour - water poured down the\n\nstreet like a torrent - waited in a store for a while and then decided to run\n\nfor it - dashing from one awning to another    and  \n\ngetting fairly wet in the process.\n then\n\nthe rain stopped and the sun came out. \n\n  The\n\nBig Greek  Taverna.\n &\n\n  and   good conversation - a Finnish musicologist, an English\n\njournalist, an American black jazz singer, a Persian woman ( gorgeous and\n\nlovely) and her Norwegian boyfriend and an Argentinean artist.\n man played some\n\nbouzouki on a guitar for a while.\n\n\n  &\n\n  and   home early for a good night\'s rest. \n\n  Tomorrow we visit the Acropolis.\n It\'s Good Friday here tomorrow.\n We have our red candles here to carry in the procession.\n Greek Easter is a big thing and happens a week after we celebrate it\n\nin Canada. \n\n  We have already been invited to two places for dinner this\n\nweekend.\n\n\n  says this is\n\nonly the beginning.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  : I am sitting on a huge rock by the Aegean\n\nsea on the Island of Thassos.\n We arrived here from Kavala by ferry this morning.\n Of course it isn\'t beach weather, but the sun is shining beautifully\n\nand  Rose  and I just finished having a lovely picnic on a table a\n\nlittle ways from where I am right now. \n\n  A fishing boat with 3 or 4 men in passed by and now the sea is\n\nclear of crafts - only the layers of blue grey near the shore, a strip of\n\ngreen beyond that and that vivid blue that characterizes the    Aegean   farther out. \n\n \n\nand we have two days to do very little.\n warmer -

to act as a breakwater, I guess.\n Some of them are chunks of marble.\n Imagine throwing marble into a pile of rocks to serve as a\n\nbreakwater! \n\n  We left Athens on the 16th and have been going strong ever since.\n We took the train to Kalambaka ( 3-4 hours by train) which is in the\n\nmiddle of Greece ( Thessaly).\n It\'s a beautiful clean little town set just below the Meteora -\n\nmonasteries built 600 years ago by monks ( Byzantine).\n They perch high up on the rocks, clinging on quite firmly.\n We took a bus up there and climbed 170 steps to the top of the "\n\nGreat Meteora" - examined the church,    et cetera \n\n\n\n\n  In Kalambaka we also visited an ancient Byzantine church.\n\n\nKalimera   they said,  Good afternoon  .\n\n\n\n  We left in the late afternoon on a shorter train ( 1 1/2 hr)\n\nwhich jiggled and  took  us to meet another train ( more comfortable,\n\nbut which had a lot of gypsies on board    and  \n\ntheir unruly kids nearly drove us crazy begging and running around).\n trip was quite\n\nfascinating because we saw flocks of sheep everywhere led by a shepherd with\n\na crook and a dog.\n Many were women.\n We also saw goat herders ( also many female).\n\n\nunclear word </unclear> grape vines and olive groves and apparently tobacco.\n\n\nunclear word </unclear>  Athens as well).\n chrysanthemums colour\n\nthe roadside and the houses    and   tavernas are\n\ndecorated with red pots containing mostly geranium although tulips    et cetera   grow in the yards too. \n\n \n\nknee are giving me some trouble - lots of walking and the worst part is\n\nlugging our bags.\n\n\n  We stayed in Thessaloniki only one night - it\'s a big city - not\n\nsure of the population, but at least as big as Vancouver. \n\n  Yesterday we toured the famous archeological museum ( Philip\'s -\n\nAlexander\'s father - bones are there - etc) of course it is in Macedonia \n\n  and    Rose  was in her element.\n Me feet hurt from the pavement.\n\n\n  Then in the afternoon we took a bus to Kavala ( a seaport town)\n\n   and   stayed there in a nice hotel.\n caught\n\nthe ferry over here to Thassos.\n After our two days here -

{'text': "January   17, 1992  \n\n\n  Well, things seem to be back to as normal as they get around here.\n We had a doozy of a storm Tuesday and Wednesday - - started with\n\npouring rain Tuesday night, then freezing rain, then snow and high winds and\n\nCOLD.\n\n\n Fahrenheit   ) in 24 hours.\n The poor old Honda was covered in a thick coat of ice and all but one\n\nof the doors were frozen shut.\n In fact, we only got the passenger door open this afternoon after the\n\ntemperature had risen to a balmy - 7 or so.\n I guess I told you in my note that the pipes froze but not really\n\nsolidly, so we got the water going again after a half hour or so.\n It was below freezing in the basement so we turned the heater on down\n\nthere to warm it up a bit. \n\n  We were awakened early Wednesday morning by cracking noises coming\n\nfrom the roof.\n It was just the joists popping from the cold; I guess that happens\n\nwhen they contract.\n\n\n  Even with both stoves going, it is still pretty cold in the house\n\nwhen the outside temperature gets so low.\n We had to keep the bathroom door open so the pipes wouldn't freeze,\n\nso that made it even colder.\n We have lots of sweaters and everything, but we don't have long\n\nunderwear ( yet), so I've been wearing my pyjama pants under my jeans to keep\n\nmy legs warm.\n The air below knee level was very cold yesterday, even close to the\n\nstove.\n\n\nalthought   although   one is instantly in your lap when you\n\nsit down. \n\n  It was only - 18C this morning when we got up, and by this\n\nafternoon it had warmed up to about - 7C, but then it started to snow. \n\n  In spite of all of the above, for the first time in my life I'm\n\nstarting to appreciate winter.\n I endured it as a kid ( didn't have much choice) but it's different\n\nnow.\n Even shovelling our 150-foot driveway is fun, if you can believe\n\nthat!\n And of course, driving can get kind of exciting.\n The roads have been very slippery, especially today because we had\n\nsnow and wind, so the snow covered the ice which was already on the roads,\n\nmaking them very treacherous. \n\n  and I have gone for long walks in the forest,\n\nlooking at the animal tracks and trying to identify all the trees and plants.\n So far just deer and rabbit tracks are the only ones we are sure\n\nabout, but there are lots of tracks that look like fox or coyote ( there's a\n\nreal problem with coyotes here - - the people down the road lost 20 sheep a\n\nweek last summer to coyotes). \n\n  We have a book which identifies the dried weeds which one finds\n\nin winter.\n Just find an interesting skeleton sticking out of the snow and low\n\nand behold, the book tells you what it is ( or was).\n Then we go to the summer weed book and see what it looks like when it\n\nis alive.\n We have a lot of something called Pepper Grass, which have really\n\npeppery seeds. \n\n  We may look into the idea of growing Ginseng.\n It grows wild in this area, and in the summer there are ads in the\n\npaper from people wanting to buy it.\n People forage for it and I guess it has been pretty well wiped out in\n\nmany areas.\n It is not easy to grow, and the plants must be nurtured from 5 to 7\n\nyears before the roots can be harvested, but the stuff is almost worth its\n\nweight in gold. \n\n Got up early the other day and baked two loaves of bread in the wood cook\n\nstove.\n Takes five hours from start to finish when you use yeast.\n Tasted good.\n I don't think I let it rise enough the second time and I burned it a\n\nbit on top, but it wasn't too bad for the first time.\n instead of water like\n\nin the recipe. \n\n  a couple of times.\n We see her about once a week to get eggs and milk.\n She's doing not too badly; worried as usual about getting her next\n\nmortgage payment together.\n She types transcripts for CBC Radio, and that pays her bills, but I\n\nwish she would get an additional source of income so she isn't so dependent\n\nupon them. \n\n  's the other\n\nday; a woman by the name of  Wilma  .\n She and her husband bought an old farm up the highway about 8 years\n\nago, fixed up the original farm house a bit, then decided to build a new\n\nhouse on the property because it cost the same as completely renovating the\n\nold one.\n Anyway, they said that three generations of the original family had\n\nlived in the place without either a well or an outhouse; a period of about 70\n\nyears or so.\n They got water from a spring on the property, and I guess they used a\n\npail for the toilet ( hopefully a different pail).\n So we're not suffering here at all when you consider what people used\n\nto put up with. \n\n  We have a barn full of pigeons, and we will have to get rid of\n\nthem.\n They have pooped all over the place and have ruined all the hay\n\nstored there.\n Once the hay is contaminated it can't be used for anything but\n\ncompost.\n We will probably have to scrape out the barn too.\n We can't have a whole lot of wild pigeons around if we are going to\n\nhave chickens, because the pigeons will pass on all kinds of parasites etc.\n The first thing we are going to try is bird seed soaked in beer.\n The theory is that it should get them good and plastered so we will\n\nbe able to pick them up and wring their drunken little necks.\n I don't relish doing it, but I guess you have to make choices.\n\n\n  's asthma is really acting up.\n It started when he got a cold the week before Christmas, and it\n\nhasn't really let up.\n He is feeling fine - - no sore throat or anything, but he gets some\n\nterrific coughing fits, almost like whooping cough.\n He went to the doctor today who wants him to try something else\n\nbesides his puffer, but there isn't really much he can do.\n\n\n  I've been slowly unpacking my books, although the boxes in my\n\nroom here have just about reached gridlock.\n I've been working on a story for the Star short story contest, but\n\nits going slowly.\n\n\n  Thank you again for the great shirt.\n I am going to look for a couple more so I can build up a supply.\n always warm shirt time in this\n\nhouse. \n\n  I've been to the library here and even got a library card.\n They've got some vertical files with all kinds of historical stuff -\n\n- really interesting, but all crammed together in an awful jumble.\n I want to find out about a mysterious James Dobie who was granted\n\nland south of here in 1821.\n He is mentioned once in a history of Lanark County.\n Will go to the land registry office in Perth to see if they have the\n\noriginal deed. \n\n  's yet about going to\n\nFlorida?\n Some real sunshine would be a treat for you, although I guess it can\n\nget cold in Florida at this time of year, even if they would never admit it.\n\n\n\n  Well, I guess that's about enough blathering.\n I've put enough in here for two letters.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n arrived.\n The snow has gone from all but the north- and east-facing hills and\n\nthe birds are arriving by the hundreds.\n This afternoon there was a flock of more than 60 cedar waxwings in\n\none of the big maple trees on the hill behind the house.\n In the last week we've seen robins, bluebirds, hawks, swallows,\n\nredwing blackbirds, herons ( five flying together today), ducks; and heard\n\nloons and geese.\n\n\n  We've been back to the creek several times, the last time two\n\ndays ago, and there was just frozen slush along the shore with open water in\n\nthe middle.\n You can hear the beaver dam roaring loudly when you stand outside the\n\nhouse.\n No sign of flowers yet, although there are a few green leaves\n\nstarting to show in the fields.\n I keep looking for Trilliums and other spring flowers, but so far\n\njust dead leaves. \n\n  had to spend a couple of days at the vet.\n On Tuesday we noticed he couldn't urinate, so we took him in and they\n\nhad to stick a catheter in him so he could pee.\n We are supposed to put him on a diet of food which costs &dollar;2.00\n\na can!\n OK\n\n  okay   .\n We noticed that Purr, which we feed both the cats, is very low in\n\nmagnesium, so  Paul  suggested that maybe it is the water that is\n\ncausing the problem - - you know how much mineral is in our water.\n I guess we should get it analyzed.\n says the soil is very high in magnesium so the water\n\nprobably is too.\n We now are giving the cats distilled water, so that hopefully that\n\nshould do the trick. \n\n  We bought a wood-splitter on Monday.\n Saw an ad in the paper, so drove out to a farm near Ottawa to see the\n\nthing.\n The owner is a retired Navy officer, and he and his wife run a crazy\n\nplace that is basically a huge petting zoo for kids.\n He said that they have thousands of school kids every year come on\n\nschool outings ( all paid admissions of course) to see the animals.\n They have the usual assortment of chickens, ducks and geese, and\n\nalso donkeys, sheep and goats, a llama, pigs and horses and probably lots of\n\nother things.\n However they had a couple of pigmy goats which were the cutest\n\nthings you've ever seen.\n The adults are the size of regular breed baby goats, so I imagine\n\nthe pigmy babies are like kittens.\n in the Navy.\n\n\n  Anyway, the wood-splitter is a big hydraulic piston which rams a\n\npiece of wood into a stationary blade, thus splitting the wood.\n It is powered by a gas engine, so sounds like a dozen chain saws\n\nrunning at once.\n However, it will beat splitting eight cords of wood by hand, not to\n\nmention halve our wood cost by letting us buy 8 cords of logs.\n We will then cut the logs into pieces with the chain saw and split\n\nthem with the splitter. \n\n  We spent several hours yesterday and today preparing seeds.\n We bought a couple of soil blockers which compress potting soil into\n\ndifferent size squares into which you put seeds for sprouting, one seed per\n\nblock of soil.\n When the seedlings are ready to be put into the ground, you don't\n\nhave to separate seedlings from each other, thus damaging the roots - - you\n\njust pop each soil block into the ground, containing its sprouted seed.\n This also means that you don't have to thin out seedlings like you\n\ndo when you plant seeds in the ground. \n\n  We are using a mixture of potting soil and worm castings for the\n\nseeds.\n There is a place in Perth which sells worm castings - - they are\n\nreally cheap, &dollar;8.00 for a 60 pound bag.", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'ed0b22eb-3268-495f-868b-c41d7f1a3ad0', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.712234+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9832814931869507, 'non_english_score': 0.016718506813049316}

{'text': '-\n was in town ( for the bata shoe museum opening) last\n\nweekend    and   told me about  shawna  -\n i can only imagine what you\'ve been through in the past many months -\n mom was diagnosed with colo-rectal cancer just over six years ago -\n but she\'s not my life partner -\n\n\n  and   the cancer specialist only wants to see her\n\nevery five years now although she still goes for the blood work a couple of\n\ntimes a year.\n it is amazing how one copes - she made her mind up that it was not\n\ngoing to kill her and, i don\'t know, " they" do say that a positive attitude\n\nis critical in cancer recovery\n ( god, i\'m doomed, if i ever get it ....) -\n of course, being my mother ( we don\'t ask anyone for support), there\n\nwas no asking for help -\n\n\n got some pamphlets, but i never quite had the courage to give them to\n\nmom.\n\n\nand   drinks, never exercises    and   she is\n\nfine today.\n once she was over all the surgery, she really was fine.\n i know it preys on her mind ( that was her " excuse" for drinking,\n\nwhen confronted, however the drinking started long before this), but i think\n\nit\'s less and less of a stress as time goes on - especially having passed\n\nthat " no-longer-magical-but-still-a-nice-number-to-achieve" ( this from the\n\ncancer specialist who never cracks a joke or a smile - and chain smokes) five\n\nyears. \n\n  looks wonderful -\n she seems to have become stronger as the years have passed, but she\'s\n\nstill the sensitive, caring, perceptive woman she always was.\n i do miss her, but i\'m going to make more of an effort to get to\n\nmontreal.\n she is enjoying her job, but there are no guarantees -\n of course there are no guarantees about job security for any of us\n\ntoday.\n job placement councellors are advising people that there is no longer\n\nsuch a thing as " a job for life" -\n i\'m having a particularly hard time with this, but more of that later\n\n-\n , but\n\nshe\'s getting along.\n they were putting the boat " in" or " out" or whatever it is you do\n\nto boats in the spring, last week, so i\'m sure they spent the weekend on it -\n worked very hard on it all winter as to be\n\nready for the spring.\n\n\n  -\n "\n\nnormal" -\n although i know that she too feels the stresses and strains of\n\nliving.\n -\n the guy in Ottawa -\n but i don\'t know if it\'s going anywhere -\n she does, however, plan to spend most of the summer in Ottawa - or\n\nshe did the last time we spoke about it -\n so, she must be somewhat interested!!\n she is still living at home, which apparently works for her.\n sometimes two minutes of my mother is enough.\n , but i guess she still has some\n\nreservations -\n but then, except when you\'re 18 and you\'re sure ( you\'re wrong, but\n\nyou\'re sure), i suspect one always has doubts.\n there just is no such thing as a perfect relationship.\n her brother is getting married next weekend, so that\'s another\n\nweekend she cannot spend with  gary  -\n\n\nall that stuff, but gets -    i   , don\'t know the\n\nword, annoyed, frustrated, uncertain - when a couple of weeks go by    and   she cannot / does not see him.\n\n\n  as for me and my house - well, i still have a job as of today.\n last week, i wasn\'t so sure.\n i was scheduled to go to barbados on Sunday - had my ticket, my limo\n\nbooked, had arranged to pick up my traveler\'s cheques,   \n\net cetera   -\n we don\'t\n\nreally need you  ,  in the interests of cost containment\n\n ,  i\'ve spoken to  Terry  ( our boss) about it\n\n ,  yabeda, yabeda, yabeda  .\n\n\nthen spent the rest of the day panicking about whether or not i would have a\n\njob on monday - when my boss returned from barbados.\n the weekend, which should have been wonderful, was ruined - when i\n\nwasn\'t worrying    and   stewing about this career\n\nthing, i was euphoric -\n\n\netc.   et cetera      et cetera  \n a.m.\n\n  , the first thing he did was to tell me that it was  garet \n\n( the senior manager in barbados) who came up with this idea  \n\n and   without saying anything concrete, reassured me about the\n\ninterim anyway.\n long term, i really doubt it.\n Beano\n\nBank  -\n but i had hoped to get through my " mortgage years" ( which i hope\n\nwill end by 2002 - which sounds like an eternity away, but is really only\n\nseven years away!)    and   then it would not be so\n\ncritical that i stay with the bank.\n I\'m not sure i have another 7 years here, though.\n - banking\n\nwas never part of my life plan, although it has become so.\n a couple of options which i plan to explore - even though things look\n\ngood in the short term, i have to think about the big picture - are teaching\n\n( community college - i could teach business practice, business english,\n\ncommunications and the like) and " technical system implementation\n\nmanagement" -\n there must be 100 banks in canada now -\n all of them must be installing and changing their systems as we speak\n\n-\n and that is what my last 6 years experience is -\n translating the business needs for the computer people, then taking\n\nthe system    and   training the end users, as well\n\nas documentation, project management,    et cetera \n\n\n so, i don\'t feel hopeless about it, but i don\'t feel good.\n the first thing i need to do is get a resume together - haven\'t had\n\none for 16 1/2 years!!\n i\'ve already started making calls about references, since i may not\n\nwish to involve my boss at this time.\n\n\n  it sounds like your job is not 100% guaranteed either -\n i guess that\'s our " welcome to the 21st century" - do you worry\n\nabout it, or are you fairly confident that there is a market for your\n\nskills??\n it sounds like you\'re still enjoying it anyway!\n \'s guys are sounding very independent -\n i\'m sure that brings its own issues.\n how is the house?\n are you out in the garden this time of year?\n ( one of the many things i like about condo living - someone else\n\ndoes the gardening!!)\n my parents just wait all winter for the garden to be accessible\n\nagain, and how is the rest of your family?\n dad\n\nmuch?\n and\n\n  i do speak to them every couple of days when i\'m in town - but it\'s\n\nnot simple.\n i\n\ndon\'t cope well with it.\n i\'ve tried confrontation and, frankly, " been there, done it, don\'t\n\nneed to do it again" - or perhaps it\'s " won\'t do it again".\n it has cut back my drinking in a major way, so i guess it\'s not all\n\nbad.\n however, i have my own addictions with which i must deal ....\n\n\n  however, basically, all is well here in the big city - if i still\n\nhave a job in november ( and the possibility of a job in  ) , i\n\nhope to go back to the  real  big city - ny, ny ( the centre of the\n\nuniverse is the plaza hotel ....) \n\n  Take care.\n\n\n\n\n  - how are you and everyone and thing around\n\nyou?\n I\'m just enjoying this spring-like weather we\'re having right now!\n that cold snap we had for 6 weeks or whatever really seemed to take a\n\nlot out of people.\n we, of course, had visitors from the islands for the first two weeks\n\nof january -\n i cannot tell you how much they hated being here.\n one of them smokes and this building is designated " smoke-free", so\n\ni had to take her outside a couple of times a day to have a cigarette - she\n\nsaid it was almost enough to make her quit smoking!\n ( but there\'s always that " almost"!)\n anyway, we accomplished what we set out to do with their trip up\n\nhere, which was great.\n\n\n  work is work these days.\n the bank, in its infinite wisdom, is letting many people go, so it is\n\nno longer a " secure" job, which i find very hard.\n counselled\n\n  me to change jobs -\n i could be making a lot more money elsewhere.\n i stayed for a couple of reasons -\n i like what i do and the security of working for the bank.\n i still like what i do most of the time, but it is no longer a secure\n\njob.\n my boss has told me that as long as he has any say, i have a\n\nposition, but it\'s not a good feeling.\n , retired at the end of january, so i\'ve\n\nassumed his responsibilities ( which makes me slightly more desirable as an\n\nemployee) and taken over his office.\n his responsibilities range from the ridiculous to the sublime.\n i have to take care of the weekly lottery ( big responsibility), the\n\nmonthly status of the 1994 electronic data processing capital budget results,\n\nthe quarterly report of systems activities, none of which require much brain\n\npower.\n then there\'s the semi-annual systems planning meeting, at which i\n\nwill be secretary and scribe, producing the approximately 3 inches of paper\n\nwhich emanates from that meeting -\n that is a really big job.\n I\'m hoping that each meeting builds from the previous one, or i\'m in\n\ntrouble!\n the good news about that meeting is that i get to attend with the\n\nsenior managers, all of whom i like and respect, and my boss.\n it is also somewhere warm ( i think jamaica), probably in march.\n the good news, apart from making myself somewhat more valuable, is\n\nthat i got  jimmy  \'s office.\n i now have a window, not much of a view, but the natural light is\n\nwonderful.\n i also have wooden furniture, so that when i crash into it as i\n\ncross my legs, there is a " thunk" instead of a " clang".\n\n\nvaliantly   to avoid " credenza mentality" (\n which is where you receive something, read it, file it in the\n\ncredenza and, in your mind, it\'s complete.\n meanwhile, it really requires some action on your part, but you\'d\n\nswear you\'d done it    and   it isn\'t until you go\n\nthrough the credenza that you discover it, undone - along with a handful of\n\nother uncompleted work packages).\n\n\n  in her\n\nprevious position.\n when i last spoke to her, she\'d been back for three days, but she\n\nwas ecstatic about it.\n , but\n\ni think she feels that she does not have a great chance of that.\n\n\noffered her her old job, which she jumped at.\n thought she should have asked for time to think about\n\nit, or money or something, but in today\'s economy, she felt the best thing to\n\ndo was to take it -

I like her.\n She is bright, creative and unfortunately, very easily influenced by\n\npeers.\n I hope she does well and breaks out of her family successfully.\n I don\'t think I\'m ready for another little sister, so I\'ll be hunting\n\nfor another type of volunteer work.\n If Calgary gets the bid for the 2005 World Fair, that might be an\n\nexciting volunteer experience. \n\n  On October 22, a colleague and I are presenting a workshop on our\n\nvolunteer programs in  Metrotown  at the Child Welfare League of\n\nCanada conference.\n I am scared to death, but am looking forward to it just the same.\n and I are organizing a panel discussion composed of\n\nvolunteers and families who have been serviced by our volunteers and by way\n\nof stories from the panel members, intend to cover topics like:\n how volunteers work with child welfare workers,\n how families benefit ( or not) from volunteer friends,\n what type of training would best prepare volunteers for outreach\n\nwork,\n what tips could be given to volunteers who work with community\n\nfamilies ........\n\n\n \n\nFitness.\n It is very convenient - right next door to my work - so I generally\n\nsneak over at lunchbreak.\n I take whatever class is going - sometimes it is low bounce,\n\nsometimes it is extended cardio, sometimes it is step ...\n I also walk whenever I can and have golfed more this summer than in\n\nprevious years.\n\n\n  Theatre starts on October 12.\n Four of us women go for dinner then out to a theatre production at\n\nTheatre  Bigtown  about 6 times per year.\n This year\'s roster includes Little House of Horrors.\n We\'ve been doing this for 5 years and look forward to each play.\n Even if we don\'t end up giving every play raving reviews, we have fun\n\ncritiquing. \n\n  Writing wise, I\'ve submitted a short article on our Teen Parent\n\nFriend program to a local newsletter called  VolReview  ( the \n\nAssociation of Volunteer Resources  magazine), and hope they\'ll publish.\n I\'ve also submitted a poem to a woman in California who is collecting\n\npieces for a book called: From the Heart - Letters from Daughters to their\n\nFathers.\n She\'s written me back saying she is considering my poem for the book.\n I am thinking about entering a short story contest from Regina called\n\nthe Short Grain Writing contest - this would be a first for me and now that\n\nI\'ve told you, I guess I\'ll have to do it, right? \n\n  Over the last few years, I\'ve been contemplating returning to\n\nschool for graduate studies, but I\'m not at all sure I want to go for a\n\nmasters in social work.\n In fact, I\'m thinking about a graduate degree in communication\n\nstudies.\n Currently, I\'m researching the program at the U of C - talking to\n\nprofessors who teach there as well as students who are taking or who have\n\ngraduated from the program.\n I\'m in the information gathering phase ... will keep you posted.\n\n\n\n  Less than 2 months until Australia and we can hardly wait!\n This time, we\'ll be flying to Sydney via Singapore, then will move\n\nsouth to Tasmania, north again to Adelaide then to the westcoast and Perth.\n It should be a very nice break -

{'text': 'Radical Forum for\n\nFundamentalists  ] CAPER \n\n  Greetings RAPpers, and other interested parties.\n\n\n  I was enjoying my customary pre-lunch snooze in my air-conditioned\n\nyurt on the fourth floor of CSIS  headquarters, when suddenly I was interrupted by an e-mail\n\nmessage flashing across my PC screen. \n\n  The word had come down from on high [ no, not the Almighty, and in\n\nthe interests of accuracy, it actually came up from the 3rd floor], that a\n\nhighly [ make that, hardly] secret mission to Moscow had been commissioned to\n\nexchange information on the IRF threat.\n The Russians, it had been decided, had something to tell us about the\n\n" green menace".\n It could even have a bearing on the security of Canada.\n What could they possibly know about this subject that we hadn\'t\n\nalready learned from our myriad expert sources?\n After all, 70 years of communism could hardly have led to privileged\n\naccess to the inner sanctums of religious extremism.\n\n\nsecret codes?\n Could they finally have come up with the elusive original of the\n\nRushdie   fatwa   ?\n Or a draft copy of the Islamic Republic\'s next five-year plan?\n\n\n has to say about the future of the Middle East peace process? \n\n  Whatever it was, it behoved us to listen and try to learn, until\n\nwe could corroborate or falsify their data.\n Hoping to narrow the range of this exchange, and perhaps elicit a\n\nclue as to the nature of their insider info, we sent them a list of twenty\n\ntopics to choose from, including theoretical and operational categories.\n Despite our enthusiasm to be more fully in the know, no agenda was\n\nforthcoming on the eve of our scheduled departure.\n Lulled into complacency by the thought that we could always\n\nextemporise our own views of this broad topic, it nonetheless niggled that we\n\ncouldn\'t know in advance in more detail what they wanted to talk about.\n Could anything good, or new, come from such an ill-considered\n\nundertaking?\n What were the risks we faced, apart from intestinal distress and\n\ndepleted budgets?\n Stroking our scepticism, and carefully packing our dog-eared copy of\n\nthe IRF bible, Ayatollah Khomaini\'s  Problems Elucidated  , we\n\nprepared for take-off. \n\n  In the face of such high risk and uncertainty, your intrepid\n\nagent was reassured at rejoining his colleagues in Amsterdam for the final\n\nleg of the journey to Moscow.\n However foolhardy one\'s own decision to travel to such a destination\n\nunder such obscure circumstances, surely they, with all their worldly\n\nexperience, could not also be easily inveigled into a reckless adventure.\n There must have been more to this meeting than met the eye.\n Never mind that it was not apparent even to them.\n All would be revealed in due time.\n Allah works in wondrous ways.\n\n\n  Our hosts met us at the end of the disembarkation ramp with a\n\nhuge sign bearing the logo Mr. J. C A N U C K.\n We surrendered our passports and currency declaration forms and were\n\nwhisked through customs and immigration to the two vehicles waiting to\n\ntransport us to the Guest House in the center of the city.\n An hour later we were being shown to our rooms in a spacious\n\napartment on the fifth floor of an old building on  Pysanky  Street.\n From the balcony one could see the towers of the Kremlin and the\n\nspires and domes of adjacent churches.\n So this was it.\n The moment of truth was approaching.\n\n\n  A ridiculous thought crossed my mind as we gazed across the\n\nMoscow skyline and chatted amiably with our English-speaking Russian hosts.\n Had they discovered some fiendish plot by the Islamic Republic of\n\nIran to export, along with revolution, the larger and broader dome of the\n\nIslamic world, thus putting the smaller and rounder domes of the Russian\n\nstyle at a commercial disadvantage in the world market?\n Naaah, I told myself, that couldn\'t be it, the smaller version would\n\nsell at a fraction of the larger one\'s price, even if subsidized, and besides\n\nthe futures market for domes, especially in the West, must be somewhat\n\ndepressed these days.\n Maybe the Japanese might go for such a pitch, but I doubted it.\n It had to be something else.\n\n\n  After a sixteen hour plane journey we were exhausted and our\n\nhosts realized they ought to withdraw and leave us to rest.\n They probably concluded, sensibly, that anything they might learn\n\nfrom us in our groggy condition would not be entirely focused or reliable.\n Besides it was they who had something to communicate.\n The plan was to return at 6:00 p.m. for supper and a tour of the city\n\nafterwards.\n When they left we checked out our rooms for bugs and found nothing\n\nthat Raid couldn\'t deal with.\n But we were too tired to talk, and opted to lounge around and read or\n\ntake in more of the city from the balcony. \n\n  Pre-occupied with what to expect the following day, we were\n\nunable to contemplate sleep, fearing also that would mean being unable to\n\nsleep through the night.\n This last worry was pure indulgence; although we didn\'t retire until\n\n10:30, we all reawakened between 1:00 and 2:00 a.m., and were unable to doze\n\noff again till later that morning.\n How could we possibly have forgotten to pack the Nitol?\n Does this tell us something about our policy planning department?\n This meant we were not at our best during the day\'s deliberations.\n This pattern continued with your trusty agent right through the four\n\nnights he spent in Moscow.\n\n\n  The tour of the city was conducted, to paraphrase an old\n\napothegm, under the cover of [ gathering] darkness.\n The major attraction was the view from the Nevsky Prospekt out over\n\nthe glittering city below, and a stop near the tall and massive structure\n\nhousing Moscow University, ablaze with lights from top to bottom.\n Talk about the aerie heights of higher education!\n Getting from a physics lab on the ground floor of this building to a\n\npsychology lecture on the top could take more than half an hour.\n If the elevators ever broke down, it could take several days.\n Any student would need to be equipped at all times with a sturdy pair\n\nof mountain boots, and an oxygen pack against thin air.\n\n\n  During our stay in the Russian capital the temperature hovered\n\naround 0 centigrade and the streets were free of snow.\n One gained a distinct impression of space, of room to manouver.\n For a capital city laid out before the onslaught of the automobile,\n\nthe main streets and arteries were remarkably wide and spacious.\n Perhaps that could be partly due to WWII devastation and\n\nreconstruction.\n More likely it was the result of Napoleon\'s siege when the Muscovites\n\nare said to have set fire to three-quarters of the city themselves and razed\n\nit in order to prevent its capture.\n Whatever the explanation, traffic flow, even at rush hour, seemed\n\neasily manageable, a far cry from the streets of downtown Ottawa, or the\n\ncrushing frustration of the drive home to Orleans after work. \n\n  When the traffic did back up slightly near the central region\n\nclose to the flat, our driver activated the siren and turned on the light on\n\nthe roof of our Mercedes, and took off down the middle [ no-go] lane of the\n\navenue.\n Your average Moscow motorist, a fairly disciplined and restrained\n\nbreed, in this observer\'s view, compared to his Montreal counterpart, must\n\nhave thought we were some visiting royalty or head of state [ assuming he /\n\nshe didn\'t look too closely].\n As we approached an underpass on our route, the delegation head\n\nleaned forward and asked our host in the front seat what the writing said on\n\na huge banner strung up on the bridge overhead.\n " New Era Bank!\n\n\n\n  We returned to our quarters around 8:30p.m.and prepared to\n\nretire.\n Before departing for the night our hosts showed us how to work the\n\nlock on the apartment door, and where the key was hung, in case of fire.\n Looking down on the street below from the balcony one could see\n\nnumbers of people still bustling about, even at 9:00p.m.\n A brightly lit kiosk on the corner across the way was the center of\n\nconsiderable activity.\n Cars would pull up in front, their drivers descend, and return\n\ncarrying their purchases after visiting the stall.\n What could this be?\n What commerce was being conducted at this hour of the night that\n\ncouldn\'t wait till tomorrow?\n Probably a drug dealer, I told myself.\n Stripped of its Marxist-Leninist moral purity, Russia had already\n\njoined the real world.\n Boy, were we in for a surprise.\n Our sources informed us the following day that this was a flower\n\nstall, that tomorrow was an official holiday in honour of International\n\nWoman\'s Day, and that these were your worshipful, sensitive, non-MCP Russian\n\nhusbands and swains stopping on the way home after a long day at the office\n\nto buy a bouquet for the objects of their devotion.\n Holy moly!\n Does the office of the Minister for the Status of Women in Ottawa\n\nrealize that the Russians have got the jump on us in the gender stakes?\n\n\n  But I digress.\n The main purpose of our mission had to be kept in the forefront of\n\nour attention,    i.e.   the formal talks.\n In the course of expounding their view of the IRF threat, the\n\nRussians would reveal some information vital to the security of Canada.\n We therefore had to be alert to their every word.\n Given our fractured attention spans, this wasn\'t easy.\n Since the words were delivered in Russian, we had to attend the\n\npauses in their speech, the signal that the interpreter was about to render,\n\nas with a chunk of lard, what had just been said, in polished English.\n While they were speaking the translator would make a few furious\n\njottings with a pencil in a little red notebook.\n Then he would look up and without consulting his notes deliver the\n\nmost coherent flow of natural-sounding standard English that we\'d ever heard,\n\nwithout a single " eh " at the end of the sentence.\n\n\n Canadian   ! - eh. \n By Allah, I swear that fellow must have had a computer in his head.\n Otherwise how could he produce such fluent and idiomatic language?\n And just think, it\'s even more amazing when you realize he could do\n\nall that without ever having had the benefit of a meeting with Margaret\n\nAtwood. \n\n  So much for the talks!\n\n\n  i.e.   the food and drink.\n In a word, they were excellent.\n It simply wasn\'t true, all that talk we used to hear about the KGB\n\nagents having had their taste buds extracted as a condition of employment so\n\nthey wouldn\'t be vulnerable to the blandishments of French cuisine.\n We were offered the full range of traditional Russian fare, pancakes\n\nand cream, borscht, palmeny, cold cuts, the lot, and all of it washed down,\n\nof course, with copious draughts of vodka.\n This latter was served from a liqueur glass, so it wasn\'t as\n\ndangerous as it sounds.\n But every time one took a sip, it would be instantly replaced at the\n\ntop of the glass by a most attentive hostess.\n There were endless toasts to our new-found friendship.\n Having realized from the business sessions that we were more or less\n\non the same wavelength on the subject of IRF, we had no trouble identifying\n\nprospects that would justify us raising our glasses.\n One memorable proposal from our hosts revolved around the hope that\n\nHizbollah would finally see the light, give up its miscreant ways, and go the\n\nmainline legitimate route of its respectable Egyptian cousins, the Muslim\n\nBrothers.', 'subdomain':

{'text': 'Good to hear from you so rapidly.\n .\n Then next Monday I get all the final papers, and have a day to mark\n\nthem.\n Shouldn\'t be too much of a problem, as I already know the range of\n\nwriting and possibilities the students are capable of by this point.\n I have 17 students.\n It would be nice if one or two of them surprised me by doing much\n\nbetter than they have been to date, but I guess it\'s unlikely.\n I have one A student, 3 B students and the rest are really not more\n\nthan C students.\n It\'s quite the party school.\n seem like\n\nreal keeners.\n There is a real sense that the students wish to be entertained, yet\n\nat the same time they know they are being ripped off education wise. \n\n  ( that\'s his name) and I are going to come to\n\nOntario on December 28 and return to  Wintertown  on  \n\n January   8.\n I really would like to come to Montreal at least for one night.\n experience winter in a\n\nCanadian context, even though it will be a bit of a whirlwind, hence the\n\nvisit.\n I used my frequent flyer points.\n If we were to visit Montreal, it likely would be that I\'d have rented\n\na car, and would arrive mid day, to leave at the end of the following day.\n Sounds rushed, but I still think it would be worth it.\n An organized approach to the visit on my part could accomplish a lot,\n\n n\'est-ce pas  ?\n Would you be in town in early January?\n\n\n  What is your schedule these days?\n Do you have a lot of free time?\n Is it chopped up into little bits the way my own seems to be?\n I thought I had a book contract almost in hand from the University of\n\n Marlboro  Press.\n Then I thought I had lost it.\n Now I seem to ( maybe) sort of have a good chance at getting my\n\ndissertation published, in revised form, something I have to really work on\n\nin the early new year, as I promised the editor there, with whom I\'ve\n\nestablished a sort of rapport, that I\'d have the thing rewritten by end of\n\nMarch... \n\n  This past 6 weeks, I\'ve applied for 13 jobs.\n One in South Africa, one in England, two in Toronto, and the rest\n\naround the U.S.\n I hope I get at least one interview out of all of this effort.\n is an excellent editor and has been a great help in\n\nhoning and polishing the various letters of application.\n He\'s just turned in the introductory chapter of his dissertation to\n\nhis advisor.\n Now he\'s trying to crank out a second chapter before we come to\n\nOntario.\n He was a bit slow in getting started ( as was I) but now he seems\n\nquite enthused.\n What a process.\n in Ottawa once commented on the need to be\n\nhalf-crazy in order to do a Ph.D.\n\n\n  At any event, to bed in order to rise to instruct the young in\n\nthe ways of right livelihood.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n  A brief message ...\n life is pretty crazy and good at this point in time ...\n and I have parted ways, he has returned to central New\n\nYork to live on his farm for the summer ...\n he may return to the Bay Area in the fall and live in Sonoma county\n\nto the north of San Francisco.\n We both hope that over time we can remain friends / become friends.\n Many issues came between us during the last few years, and for my\n\npart, I must admit the dissertation process placed extreme strain on our\n\nrelationship ...\n about a year and a half ago I began spending a fair bit of time on\n\nthe internet, looking for people with whom I might have a more meaningful set\n\nof conversations than seemed available to me in \'real life\' ... in the Bay\n\nArea ...\n San Fransisco\n\n  , needing to write - which precluded making a lot of new friends (\n\nor any) in a totally new town, inheriting several of  Steve  \'s\n\nfriends, most of who I don\'t connect with all that well, nor they with me ...\n\n\nwith whom I began a lengthy internet dialogue ...\n His situation was similar to my own ...\n He is a dissertator in English, was living in a relationship that was\n\nincreasingly unsatisfactory ...\n In March he and I met ...\n Subsequently we arranged to meet 5 additional times, we\'ve just\n\nreturned from a month-long camping trip in northern California and Oregon ...\n He has left his partner, and I mine, each of us for each other ...\n I guess I want to say he\'s the love of my life, the fellow I\'ve long\n\nwanted / waited to meet ...\n and / but I know this has already seemed like the cliche of the 90\'s ...\n " \'what???\n You guys met on the internet?\' " is a response I\'ve already\n\nencountered ...\n I prefer to recall the older \'network\' of postcards and written\n\ncorrespondences into which people once entered and out of which sometimes -\n\nas in our case - emerged meaningful \'in the flesh\' connections and\n\nrelationships ... \n\n  Actually we\'ve discussed writing queer theory together ...\n the pun title of our first piece will be \'I met my boyfriend on the\n\ninternet\' ...\n anyway ...\n , where both\n\nof us are going to try living together ...\n Wintertown\n\n , so it will be a new place for both of us ...\n I will try a 9 month period or so, my visa expires next June.\n Who knows?\n\n\n  I\'ve had sort of a nibble on publishing the dissertation.\n If I were to be so lucky as to actually get a book contract, then the\n\ninevitable rewriting can get me a term position teaching introductory\n\ncomposition skills at  Lake  .\n\n\n  He and I will be driving to Ontario, the farm and Ottawa /\n\nToronto in a couple of weeks.\n We\'ve also spoken about the possibility of making it as far as\n\nMontreal.\n Will you be there?\n Let me know if you\'re interested in a visit.\n I also ought to give you my email address ...\n\n\n  I know I\'ve been tardy in replying to your request for a writing\n\nsample.\n I hope you will understand that the past three months have been\n\nunremittingly stressful / overamped / spinny.\n If you are still interested, let me know.\n ?\n\n\n  All the best\n xo\n\n\n \n\n\n  .\n I defend the dissertation in two weeks on April 9th.\n I\'m entirely exhausted, physically, psychically, emotionally ...\n\nwhatever.\n The department had promised me I\'d teach this summer, but then\n\nretracted the offer ( giving it to someone they favour who has already\n\ntaught) at the last moment, after I\'ve moved all my stuff back here for the\n\nsummer.\n Figures.\n It\'s really a fucked up place right now.\n said you had telephoned.\n I am right now like one of those toy tops that children play with.\n There is a handle on the top that you pump up and down.\n This causes the top to spin round and round.\n Inside things whistle and whirr, and on the better models, little\n\nimages flap and fly.\n That\'s how I feel.\n I\'m housesitting a big suburban split level here for the month.\n I\'ll be here till April 24th.\n .\n Sorry I haven\'t got around to forwarding you any writing samples.\n Or was it to your colleague?\n I have that earlier email somewhere.\n I received it right in the middle of the most intense final editing\n\nprocedure.\n I hope you\'re well.\n Perhaps I\'ll be able to make it to Ontario in late summer.\n I\'m going to extend my visa to stay in the US for one year - a once\n\nin a lifetime offer that is extended to grads, and during which I can look\n\nfor work in my field.\n Anyway, I don\'t have to look for work as a condition of the visa.\n I will, but I\'ll likely just hang out in SF for the year, and\n\nrewrite the    dissertation   and churn\n\nout some articles and ( etc.)\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n  It was a great pleasure to get your letter, with so many\n\ninteresting things in it.\n Our own memories of the Midi are still quite vivid after nearly 25\n\nyears.\n still laughs when he remembers the numerous signs\n\noutside one town you must know well yourself -

Because most Thais live in the countryside, you could say "\n\nthere\'s Bangkok and then there\'s the rest of Thailand".\n Bangkok is a big, sprawling, noisy, enthralling mass of people living\n\non top of each other, trying to muddle their way into being an oriental New\n\nYork.\n Everywhere, people are selling things ( often themselves) and\n\nbuilding things ( this is what 7 straight years of double digit economic\n\ngrowth looks like), but at the same time, there seemed to be a calmness in\n\nthe chaos and a real joy in even the simplest of lives.\n One things that endeared us to Bangkok, and indeed to all of Thailand\n\nto us, was that people there love to eat - - everywhere and constantly.\n\n\n  2. There is great history in Thailand, and once we got out of\n\nBangkok we thrilled to the sights of lonely wats (    i.e.\n\n  temples) on distant hillsides and Buddha figures on practically\n\nevery street corner.\n Religion is very close to the people of Thailand, 95% of whom are\n\nBuddhist, and we could feel the genuine veneration and sincerely-held values\n\nwherever we went. \n\n  lives in a remote part of Thailand (\n\n   i.e.   in Isaan, the northeastern provinces), we\n\ngot a chance to see parts of the country which very few foreigners see.\n We travelled on mudtracks in the mountains, by fan-tailed boat along\n\nthe Mekok River, and watched Burmese traders and functionaries exchange goods\n\nas they had for millenia in the Golden Triangle, before heroin became the\n\nmain items of commerce. \n\n  4. After drinking deeply from the well of oriental civilization\n\nwe found an out-of-the-way island and lay around on the beach for a week,\n\nrecollecting ourselves.\n We made a couple of snorkeling trips and ventured to Kho Phi Phi Le\n\nwhere, those of you who follow National Geographic specials may know, Thai\n\nsea gypsies scramble up ricketty bamboo ladders to gather swallow\'s nest for\n\n nest soup. \n\n \n\n  * the cat is fine: he\'s a mere shadow of his former self, having\n\nlost umpteen pounds at the  Roper-Charlton  Fat Cat Farm; \n\n  * we fit in some renovations in the house again this year: new\n\nkitchen, a spiffy paint job for the outside of the house, and  Mel \n\nbuilt the requisite compost boxes without which people couldn\'t giggle about\n\nthe granola belt out here; \n\n  \'s Aunt\n\n Dori  joined the Great  Roper  exodus from the prairies to the\n\nWet Coast, arriving in  Queenville  in July; and \n\n  is continuing her climb up the\n\ngreasy ( but now politically correct) pole of B.C. government;  Mel \n\nis moving into a new position as tourism economist with the B.C. Ministry of\n\nFinance; and *  Anne  \'s brother  Steve  and his wife \n\nSheena  are expecting in March.\n\n\n \n\n\n  We\'re getting a bit complacent here in the editorial office,\n\naren\'t we? \n\n  If house renovations were the prevailing theme of our last three\n\nannual epistles, it looks like babies will dominate from now on.\n Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Footloose and Fancy Free have wriggled and squirmed\n\nout of parenthood ( " We\'re not settled yet." "  Steve  and  Sheena\n\n should really have a baby first." " A baby would clash with the\n\nfurniture" - - we\'ve used them all) for who knows how many years now, but the\n\nyou-know-what has finally hit the fan.\n Life as we know it will soon come to an end.\n A baby is upon us.\n Well, soon, anyway.\n is 32 weeks pregnant and will\n\ndeliver the goods on or around February 5, 1993.\n No doubt the blessed event will be in between meetings of the\n\nProvincial Budget Committee and in time for her to write a briefing note on\n\nsome arcane policy issue, while Mike Harcourt and the legislative reporters\n\nassist  Mel  with the labour breathing.\n Then it\'s out with negotiating PIP grants and in with managing POOP\n\npants for  A & M  and ?\n ( Isn\'t it ironic that A has been developing a waste discharge\n\nprogram with the Ministry of Environment these last 7 months?) \n\n  taking maternity leave\n\nuntil August or so.\n is then going to take a six-month leave of absence to do\n\nthe male bonding thing.\n After that, the child will be offered a choice between getting a job\n\nor moving out.\n will move out.)\n Names?\n We were hoping you wouldn\'t ask.\n We like the native practice of naming it after the first thing the\n\nmother sees after the child\'s birth.\n .\n .\n Kind of has a ring to it, doesn\'t it?\n Really, who knows what we\'re going to call it - - we\'re still in\n\ndenial over the whole thing, for crying out loud.\n \'s father has suggested Rupert\n\nfor a boy and Walpirga for a girl.)\n Anne\n\n \'s second nephew,  James Paul  .\n\n\nJake  .\n\n\n  1992 wasn\'t as busy as some years in the visitor department, but\n\nnew babies seemed to be a common feature of several of our guests as well.\n By contrast, this year we had our first and probably last visitor\n\ncoming to escape their family.\n came for a weekend without\n\nher husband and 2 children and did nothing but loaf around, read, watch\n\nmovies, eat and sleep in late.\n At the end she said she felt a little guilty, but wondered if we\n\nmight have room in January ...', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'c75f7ac6-8d3d-4205-bf8f-5cd3141dc485', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.723924+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9746751189231873, 'non_english_score': 0.025324881076812744}

\n\n  We\'ve been having beautiful weather here, frosty but sunny and\n\nthe snowdrops are poking up here and there with little white flowers.\n Hope we don\'t have everything start to bloom and then have a big snow\n\nstorm or something.\n February is usually the month when we get some snow ( and we didn\'t\n\nget any last year, as I recall, so we may be in for a real arctic blast!).\n I\'ve heard you\'ve had a mild winter so far, so I hope it continues!\n\n\n\n  We are starting to have lots of company again ...\n Just got over Christmas ( and thank you for the calendar and\n\nRainForest Crunch which was eaten at one sitting!\n \'s shirt - you\'ve probably already looked at the\n\nphotos.\n Doesn\'t he look swell in it??) and the mad rush over to Burnaby to\n\nvisit  Mel  \'s mom and  James  and his two grandchildren, when\n\n Steve  appears on the scene last weekend ( I think he really misses\n\nhis family for he played with  Jimmy  by the hour!) and we are\n\nexpecting  Sheena  and the kids to come some time this week and next\n\nweekend, and then  Mel  \'s sister and her baby,  Darryl  ( he\n\nwas the premature one born in July, but he\'s doing really well and weighs\n\nover 12 pounds now) come for three weeks from Winnipeg ( although part of\n\nthat time will be spent in Burnaby - but that means we\'ll also have to go\n\nover there one weekend and have a photo taken of all four grandchildren on\n\n Mel  \'s side) and Uncle  Pete  arrives soon after ...\n Mel\n\n \'s father and  Liz  on May 1.\n ( March doesn\'t look too busy though if you\'re thinking of making a\n\ntrip out!!)\n\n\n  , they\'ve\n\ndecided to come out and live in the house they own here in  Queenville\n\n for the summer while  Liz  finishes her doctorate and defends it\n\nat UBC.\n The tenants ( we\'ve been renting out the place for them while they\'re\n\naway) have decided to move back to Calgary and so rather than rent it out\n\nagain, it will sit empty a month or two.\n She finishes teaching in St John\'s in April sometime, and they won\'t\n\nknow where she\'ll get another job until June or so, so this will give them a\n\nhome base. \n\n  It also seems to be a very bad time to sell.\n The housing market seems really soft ( due to rising interest rates\n\nno doubt!) just now and the 7 appraisals we had done by several real estate\n\nsales people sounded as if it might be a good idea to wait till the fall or\n\nnext year.\n So it should be interesting to have two sets of grandparents in town\n\nfor a while!\n It will also be interesting to see where they eventually end up.\n I guess her doctoral advisor has given her some indication that there\n\nare some positions opening up in her field next year - we\'re hoping for\n\nMontreal or Ottawa, so that we have a good excuse to go east for a visit!\n\n\n\n  ?\n so I\n\nshould get on-line and have a " chat" with her.\n\n\nQueenville  except during office hours ( when I\'m at work!!).\n does almost all his correspondence now by e-mail: to St\n\nJohn\'s to his Dad, to Winnipeg to his sister and to Burnaby to his brother\n\nand mom.\n His grandfather in Wales is also about to get hooked up - isn\'t this\n\nbizarre and it\'s free!\n\n\n  We spoke to Grandma on Christmas and she seemed very well -\n\nalthough it\'s too bad she\'ll have to move.\n to the theatre next week and Mom and Dad\n\nmentioned that she has finished an afghan for  Jimmy  and is starting\n\non a vest for me.\n Very industrious!\n She was in a great mood at Christmas and even last week, when Mom and\n\nDad picked her up for lunch 10 minutes late! \n\n  is really starting to repeat words and pick up on\n\nthings.\n His latest is " " applegoose" " for apple juice and\n\n " ba-goose"  for bottle ( yes, he\'s a little confused, but\n\nthen he is half  Charlton  , right?).\n He also started opening doors by himself.\n I\'ll be sitting in the living room reading the paper and he\'ll run to\n\nthe dining room door and say " bye!" and shut that door, run through the\n\nkitchen and open the glass door back into the living room and say " hi!",\n\nclose that door, and then run to the dining room door, open it, and say "\n\nbye!" and then run to ... well, you get it.\n It\'s really cute - until he starts slamming the doors, then I have to\n\nintervene ...\n\n\n  He wasn\'t quite his normal self around New Year\'s and then came\n\ndown with quite the head cold which then turned into a nasty cough so he was\n\nunder the weather for about 3 weeks.\n It was the first real illness that he\'s ever had besides a day with a\n\nrunny nose once in a while.\n\n\n  T V   .\n took him out to the park and he just wanted to be\n\ncarried!\n Very unusual behaviour.\n Since he\'s been better, though, we think he\'s twice as active as\n\nbefore his cold, so we\'re making up for it now! \n\n  wrote his philosophy exam yesterday ( he\'s taking a\n\ndistance course through the University of  Briggs  , History of\n\nEthical Thought) and is happy it\'s over.\n I think it has been so long since he\'s written an exam that he was\n\nworried that he wouldn\'t remember how to.\n But he thinks it went well ( he\'s been getting A+s on his papers, so\n\nI have no doubt he did very well!\n Just a little bragging there from his oh-so-proud wifie).\n He\'s planning on taking another course in the spring and in the\n\nmeantime is going to do some writing ( perhaps a screenplay?) and start\n\nsending out some more of his  books to publishers.\n There is still one publisher considering one of his books, so we\'ll\n\nhave to keep our fingers crossed. \n\n  I\'m up to my eyeballs in budget stuff at this time of year.\n Treasury Board should be making final decisions the first week in\n\nFebruary - but if the feds do anything funny ( and it sounds like they might,\n\neh?) we may have to rush around after the federal budget to offset any\n\nreduced transfer payments ...\n\n\n  mentioned that he thought the date for the reunion\n\nwas the 15th of July - but I thought you had mentioned that later in July was\n\nbetter.\n Then Mom and Dad said they thought it was going to be the August\n\nlong weekend.\n should straighten this out and send out\n\nanother announcement - but given everything that is happening in his life\n\nright now, that may be a bit too much to ask!\n So you may wish to choose a date and let him know to let everyone\n\nelse know ...', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '0830846c-04b8-4380-9529-e93cf85aa484', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.725088+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9881109595298767, 'non_english_score': 0.011889040470123291}

Reader / Browser appeal: we all agreed that it seems far less\n\ndaunting to see a series of little entries and that readers would be far more\n\n   inclined   to read a guide in bits than a\n\nguide with headings like Grammar ( try to think back to a time when such a\n\nheading filled you with  ennui  , if there ever was one!)\n\n\n\n  I hope these arguments don\'t seem too self-serving or\n\nmaterialistic, but a  omnibus  is a curious amalgam of popular and\n\nscholarly.\n aimed at pleasing\n\nscholars ( who presumably don\'t need one) that will repel precisely the group\n\nwhich needs it, primarily university students.\n We do hope to have an index that will allow people to follow a theme\n\nthrough the guide. \n\n  I look forward to seeing you in May.\n Could you please book your flight, if you have not already done so,\n\nso as to get the excursion fare?\n If you book train tickets more than five days in advance, you can\n\nsave 40% for some or all of the trip.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  Jerry\n\n got his package safely.\n Here is a repeat performance.\n got.\n project.\n I have edited everything, it has gone back to everyone; however, I\n\nhave heard back so far only from  Lara Roberts  .\n wanted me to ask you some questions about flapping\n\n relative to the  Munro  paper, but I\n\nwill save it until I see you. \n\n  I also enclose a copy of the plan a possible method for us to\n\ngenerate a word frequency list.\n Do you have any suggestions?\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n  It was great to hear your voice again!\n I hope we\'ll be able to have lunch together soon.\n\n\n  Here\'s a sketchy description or the project.\n We have a contract to deliver a machine-readable, tagged manuscript\n\nto Oxford in September 1992.\n , it will contain 2,500\n\nentries and run to    over   500 pages.\n It will be Canadian in 3 respects: our generalizations are based on a\n\nlarge ( 8 million words) database of Canadian books, magazines, journals and\n\nnewspapers covering a range of subjects and aimed at a variety of audiences -\n\n- specialist to popular.\n We also have a full year of the Globe ( 1985) and access to an\n\non-line database. \n\n  We will give advice, but tempered by what we know about what\n\nCanadians actually do.\n Thus although we will tell readers the rule about the possessive\n\nbefore the gerund, we will also tell them that it is a dying practice.\n\n\n  I would like to ask you to help on 4 issues - -\n\n\n et cetera   .\n We do not include all Canadianisms since we are not a dictionary.\n However, we do include Canadian words where there might be a usage\n\nproblem and where current American and British collegiate dictionaries are\n\nunlikely to include the information.\n I enclose a list of examples.\n 2. possibly write the entry on the comma ( ? ! )\n My view here is that since punctuation is so conventional, logic and\n\nconsistency should dictate as much as practice.\n We would, or course, try to discover what practice is - - however\n\nit\'s not all that easy to search grammatical constructions on our database.\n 3. Once I\'ve extracted all the format/style information I can from\n\nOxford, to comment briefly on same.\n 4. copyedit - - my idea is that we would send you large batches of\n\nhard copy starting in March 1992 ( with perhaps a preliminary run, just to\n\nsee what\'s happening).\n I\'m trying to keep things consistent here but it\'s complex with 4\n\npeople writing entries.\n If you think editing tagged machine-readable copy would be easier,\n\nlet me know, but I think at the finai stage hard copy is best.\n\n\n \n\netc.    et cetera   before May and then maybe we can firm\n\nthings up when we lunch. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n  didn\'t overlap.\n How does it feel to take on such an awesome responsibility?\n about the Unit,\n\nbut it was not to be.\n \'s appointment\n\nshould be renewed for a year, he sensibly refuses to get involved in the\n\nfuture of the  Language  Unit at this point in his Headship.\n So I think that your opinion is required about discussions I am\n\nhaving with Oxford, since the Department is a signatory to the contract for\n\nthe usage guide. \n\n  Canada\n\non my way here and talked to the new Managing Director,  Lillian Dowd \n\n, and  Katlyn Dresser  , the editor of the forthcoming  Canadian\n\nTimbuktoo Dictionary  , about the  omnibus  , and we agreed to\n\nchange the contract in two ways.\n We agreed on a new deadline ( necessary because the first one was a\n\nsheer guess and my recent past has prevented me from doing much work on\n\nentries) and decided that  Pam  \'s involvement in the intellectual\n\nlabour of the project should be recognized.\n , you will see\n\nthat I raised a few other issues with her after discussing the contract with\n\n Pam  . \n\n  The issue that directly concerns you is the way the royalties\n\nare apportioned.\n I don\'t want to go into a blow-by-blow account of the discussions\n\nbetween  Jack  and me over this, but it is the one occasion I can\n\nremember where we disagreed seriously.\n Unit budget was\n\nextremely healthy, but when I suggested that the royalties be split between\n\nme and the Unit he argued firmly that these should go to the Department\n\ninstead.\n One of his points was that this is the arrangement that the\n\nDepartment has with  Calum Holland  .\n\n\nEssay Skills   - - I think this weakens the analogy.\n has benefitted from the\n\nwork of members of the Department - - the Head, for example, has to spend\n\nquite a lot of unrewarded time on  Language  matters.\n His main point was that the Department suffered from the loss of the\n\nDirector\'s teaching time.\n Unit\n\npays the Department for release time, nor that I did  at least  my\n\nshare of committee work and taught one course a year for five years, even\n\nthough if the one-third rule had been applied to the 2.5 load, I would have\n\nbeen given a half course off every three years.\n I am pointing all this out in hopes that you will see at once that\n\nthe Department should consent to giving up a small portion of its royalties,\n\nas will I, so that  Pam  \'s contribution can be recognized.\n She has definitely crossed the line from employee to colleague as\n\nfar as I\'m concerned, and I think this has to be recognized in the usual\n\nways. \n\n  We worked out the proportions at the end of the contract with\n\nthe main 12 and 1/2    percent   royalty in mind:\n\nthus, roughly, 5    percent   to me, 5  \n\n percent   to the Department and 2    percent \n\n to  Pam  .\n really doesn\'t care how we divvy up the\n\nroyalties, so if you have a different suggestion, we could certainly discuss\n\nit.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '0ddfbcd4-868a-43a6-9ce7-1f72e5ec1b25', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.727800+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9706146121025085, 'non_english_score': 0.029385387897491455}

Perhaps a graduate student from Russia could work as a teaching\n\nassistant in a Russian department while studying English or linguistics.\n Similarly, a student from Canada could work with English students in\n\n Petersburg  while studying Russian.\n Departmental territoriality and funding formulas might be a stumbling\n\nblock, but I think that could be overcome by proposing the exchange to

{'text': 'I would like to apply for the position of English Language Program\n\nDirector which was advertised in the Toronto Globe and Mail this October,\n\n1995.\n I have been working in the area of adult ESL/EFL and ESP for 10 years,\n\nboth in Winnipeg and in Zaire, Africa.\n In Zaire I worked as Teacher Training Coordinator training new\n\nteachers, observing and evaluating teaching staff, ordering and developing\n\nprogram-specific materials, organizing a reference library for teachers, and\n\nconducting  workshops.\n I have a Master\'s degree in Teaching English as a Second Language with\n\na specialization in Curriculum Development.\n I have taught and developed programs for general ESL and EFL, as well\n\nas more specialized classes such as settlement language for non-confident\n\nlearners and seniors, English for business professionals, for foreign\n\nstudents preparing to study in North America, and for factory workers.\n In each of the more specialized programs I was responsible for\n\ndeveloping assessment tools and tests as well as specific curricula for each\n\nprogram. \n\n  As a teacher trainer I enjoy providing leadership in a\n\nfacilitative manner, learning from, and capitalizing on, the strengths of\n\neach individual in a given group.\n I work well under the pressure of time constraints and highly value\n\nand enjoy cross-cultural experience. \n\n  Although most of my teaching experience has been with adults, I\n\nhave been actively involved as a volunteer in my children\'s French Immersion\n\nclasses, and believe that my keen pedagogical interest in language learning\n\nin primary education would assist me in transferring my knowledge of ESL\n\ntechniques and principles to primary and middle school years as well. \n\n  Please find enclosed a copy of my resume, as well as a letter of\n\nreference from the previous director of the  Zaire-American English\n\nCollege  .\n (\n\n555) 111-5077  .\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  Dear Sir or Madam: I am responding to your ad for the position of\n\nHeadteacher in Dhaka, Bangladesh.\n I have a B.Ed. in Secondary education with a double major in English\n\nand French, and an M.Ed. in Teaching English as a Second Language ( ESL).\n I have taught adult ESL for nine years, have worked as Teacher\n\nTraining Coordinator in charge of training and in-service workshops for a\n\nstaff of 20 language instructors, and served as Academic Advisor for African\n\nstudents wishing to study in the United States.\n I have extensive experience in curriculum and instructional materials\n\ndevelopment, and have been responsible for ordering academic materials,\n\norganizing reference and resource libraries, developing placement tests and\n\nexams, and scheduling classes.\n Although most of my experience has been with adults, I taught at the\n\njunior high and high school levels for three years as a Student Teacher in\n\nthe B.Ed. program at the  University of Western Canada  . \n\n  Besides my experience with teaching, curriculum development and\n\nteacher training, I am a " people person" and relate well to people with a\n\nvariety of personalities.\n\n\npeoples\'  strengths and talents.\n I have good organizational skills but am not a dominating person.\n As a teacher I believe it is important to recognize different\n\nlearning styles among students, to establish a warm, trusting sense of\n\ncommunity in the classroom, to draw on community resources, and to help\n\nstudents know how to relate what is studied to their own lives.\n I am confident that my professional experience and organizational\n\nskills, my interest in people, and my ability to adapt to new environments\n\nand draw on the knowledge and strengths of staff members would be an asset\n\nshould you consider me for the position of Headteacher. \n\n  I am married, with 2 daughters ages 4 and 6.\n , is currently completing his Master\'s\n\nthesis on refugee issues and has been considering doing research in\n\nBangladesh for some time.\n and I have run\n\ninto problems because we are a family and most organizations seem to be\n\nlooking for single adults.\n I am including my husband\'s resume so that you may be confident that\n\nhe will be able to find employment on his own in Bangladesh. \n\n  I would love to provide my children with a cross-cultural\n\nexperience such as I had, early in their lives.\n My greatest interest, which was formed during the 16 years I spent in\n\nZaire, Africa, is getting to know different cultures, learning new languages,\n\nand working with people in educational settings. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  , Until last Thursday afternoon we believed\n\nthat all the necessary negotiations had been completed, that our role would\n\nremain the same as before with the department taking care of the Application\n\nfor Funding, the  BLAH  Budget Breakdown, and the Forecast of Cash\n\nFlow, and that we would simply sign the completed documentation.\n When you handed me the above mentioned forms with the instructions\n\nthat  Esther </@ and I would now be required to fill t hem out ourselves,\n\nit signaled to us a shift in our role vis a vis the department. \n\n  The transfer of these tasks from the department to us has\n\nsignificant ramifications, particularly in light of the current trend within\n\nthe federal government to turn over more responsibility for settlement\n\nservices to the provinces and NGOs.\n If we are to assume a more independent role and take on the\n\nresponsibility of applying for funding, enumerating and breaking down our own\n\nfunding needs, it follows logically that the starting point of contract\n\nnegotiations must be the service provider\'s own proposal.\n It is inappropriate for the department to continue to dictate what we\n\nare to write in our proposal, for that simply means we are doing the\n\ndepartment\'s paperwork and does not demonstrate any real shift towards\n\ndecentralization. \n\n  process and\n\nwould like to meet with you,  Juliana  and  Paul  to propose a\n\nnew way of " doing business" in which we take on more responsibility as a\n\nself\x97contained service providing organization.\n Attached is a copy of the points we would like to discuss with the\n\nthree of you.\n It includes a re\x97evaluation of our schedule and remuneration\n\nrequirements based on these proposed changes and on the additional assessment\n\ntime involved in the implementation of  Checkpoints  . \n\n  One other issue which needs to be resolved is the implementation\n\nof a straight forward and transparent system for payment of wages which\n\nacknowledges our need to be paid in a timely manner.\n The current system of payment which has resulted in delays of up to\n\none month, in overpayments, and in an inability of the department to provide\n\nus with accurate statements of our earnings for Income Tax purposes is not\n\nacceptable.\n I know that you are looking into this matter and look forward to\n\nreceiving a comprehensible description of how payments will be handled in the\n\nfuture. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n   and    Paul Hachek  ) \n\n\n  objectives of transferring more\n\nresponsibility for settlement services to the provinces, non\x97government\n\norganizations and private sector,  Esther  and I request the\n\ndepartment\'s support in shifting towards a more self\x97contained and\n\nindependent provision of language assessment, training referral, and\n\ninformation services.\n Towards this end, we would like to continue to provide all current\n\nservices and add to our responsibilities the following: &bullet; Submission\n\nof funding proposals and budget breakdown &bullet; Expanded provision of\n\ncomplete  BLAH  /  Checkpoints  \x97related assessment services\n\nand maintenance ( with the exception of U.I. \n\nreferrals), to include: \x97 indexing of client assessment information \x97 booking\n\nappointments ( with backup of voice message system) &bullet; Booking of\n\ncommunity liaison activities, such as: \x97 information sessions with CECs, ESL\n\ninstitutions, academic institutions and industries where applicable \x97\n\nOut\x97of\x97office assessments with  ABCD  and  XYZ  groups, and \n\nGrb \n#1 evening programs &bullet; Booking of  Checkpoints  training for\n\nother assessors based on department\'s recommendation &bullet; Determination\n\nof appropriate professional development and training sessions \n\n\n  a) In order to reflect the addition of these new\n\nresponsibilities, as well as acknowledge the professional dedication that\n\nwill be required in implementing and building community confidence in the \n\nCheckpoints  assessment process, we request that our wage be rounded up\n\nto &dollar;20 per hour from the current &dollar;18.70. \n\n  assessment\n\nprocess will take longer than the A\x97  BLAH  and will decrease the\n\nnumber of clients we are able to see each day, as well as the fact that it\n\nwill require the writing of more detailed reports, we request a return to the\n\nstandard 5, 7 \x97 hour days per week for in\x97office assessment to be divided\n\nbetween the assessors.\n This is essential not only for balancing the number of clients we are\n\nable to serve, but accomodates the additional time needed for computer\n\nindexing and other tasks which will surely accompany the implementation of\n\n Checkpoints  . \n\n \n\n \n\n\n  I will as briefly as possible outline what I have learned about\n\nMr.  Issah  \'s language / literacy training history in  Gotham \n\n, as well as the suggestions I have made and organizations with whom I have\n\nmatched him in an on-going attempt to satisfy his self-expressed needs. \n\n  \'s language proficiency for the first\n\ntime using the  BLAH  tool in October, 1995.\n At that time I noted that he has had virtually no formal schooling\n\nand had basic first language literacy needs.\n Although English is his only language, his inability to read and\n\nwrite beyond signing his name ( which, he told me, was all he could do), and\n\nmy inability to understand his dialect ( though I knew he was speaking "\n\nfluently") placed him at a Pre-  BLAH  1 level.\n Knowing that the Adult ESL Centre has an " Intake Stream" of\n\ninstruction for

the physical property retains its beauty and has been augmented by\n\nsuccessful building projects in the last four years; the camp has a healthy\n\nstable of horses; investment in youth leadership has produced an enthusiastic\n\ngroup of junior counsellors; this is one of the few tangible ways our church\n\nreaches out to youth and children; the committee has an openness to God\'s\n\nvoice and is ready to consider change in the future. \n\n  The camp also has real concerns: The camp committee members are\n\nfew in number and very tired, the physical distance and other challenges have\n\ncontributed to a lack of a real sense of ownership on behalf of the\n\ncongregations and outreach ministries of  King Albert  and \n\nRegional  Presbyteries; Congregations are not supporting the camp!\n The camp has had operating deficits during the last few years and is\n\ndrawing upon accumulated funds from logging revenue that was marked for\n\ncapital improvements and also appears to have been exhausted as a resource.\n\n\n\n  The camp wants to provide you with an opportunity to make your\n\nfeelings and willingness to support the camp known.\n As such, we ask that you bring the attached questionnaire before your\n\nAnnual General Meeting and reply to the camp before February 28th, 1996.\n Please take time to consider the letter before that date and if you\n\nare in need of clarification contact myself or the Camp President, Ms. \n\nLynn Stone  ,  or by phone  1-800-445-7735  . \n\n  IF YOU DO NOT RESPOND, WE WILL BE FORCED TO ASSUME THAT YOU HAVE\n\nNO PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE MINISTRY OF THE CAMP.\n Please take this request seriously.\n Please take time to strategize, perhaps including the questionnaire\n\nin your annual report so that your response is both considered and helpful.\n\n\n\n  Presbytery\n\ndelegate to the committee  \n\n\n\n\n  and\n\n Anna-Belle Dumont  will be married this forthcoming summer in a Roman\n\nCatholic service in New Brunswick. \n\n  We are very pleased to hear of the celebrations planned and\n\ndelight with them in the occasion. \n\n  is a member in good standing of the United\n\nChurch of Canada and we support him in his freedom to be married in whatever\n\nchurch he and  Anna-Belle  feel is appropriate. \n\n  May God be with them in the day of celebration and long years of\n\nmatrimony to follow. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n  I am sorry I didn\'t find you in the office when I phoned about a\n\nmonth ago.\n You were away doing a training event for ministry of supervision.\n Again, I want to affirm your calling to that all important ministry,\n\nI often reflect on your great help to me.\n\n\nand a personal letter from  Clark Gable  .\n \'s death.\n You might recall that we spent some wonderful time with him and have\n\nkept in touch regularly ever since.\n family.\n I\'d like to share some thoughts with you that I trust you find an\n\nappropriate way to share with the congregation ... many of whom, no doubt,\n\nare new since my time there. \n\n  There was a movie out a few years ago called " Six Degrees of\n\nSeparation."\n The title comes from a theory that everyone on the globe is connected\n\nby " six degrees."\n Put another way, everyone in the world is at least a friend of a\n\nfriend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend.\n I found this to be the most comforting of ideas ... it somehow makes\n\nthe world seem smaller, more friendly and caring.\n\n\ncongregation, even as I am involved in a part of the world far away both\n\ngeographically and in many other ways.\n I like to think this letter as being something that will bring each\n\nof us closer to our " neighbours." \n\n  I wanted to talk to you about The Healing Fund, the fund our\n\nchurch is building to help address the profound hurt that is the unfortunate\n\nlegacy of the Residential School system in which our church participated.\n While some of the Roman Catholic legacy around such schools is all\n\n   too   well known, our own United Church\n\nparticipation has been less well documented.\n James Hobart\n\n at Church House;

it may also be that he was just too busy to spend the time\n\ntrying to work it out.\n However, his remission for coordinating the internship was\n\none-quarter of his workload and as we know, he did find enough time to teach\n\nan extra course at  UMU  during the same period. \n\n  may\n\nlive in but which I have never worked in and which has specialized\n\nterminology that does not equate precisely with English.\n In addition to this, when it was decided to do it in yet another way,\n\ntaking the information from the pink / yellow sheets, after having completed\n\neverything which had been provided to me, it became obvious to me that some\n\nof the  sheets had been omitted.\n I asked for them, was given them and incorporated them.\n Again, after incorporating the additional information and then\n\nchecking through, it was obvious that I still had not been given complete\n\ninformation.\n Then once more, I was assured that I now had everything and I\n\nreturned to the task coming in on a Saturday morning before I was due to have\n\nsome days off so that it would be completed.\n Again, I was able to pick out that some information was still\n\nlacking; I could not get  Rob  on the phone and left the information\n\nwith the documentation in  Rob  \'s box as well as a message on his\n\nanswering    machine   maching pointing out\n\nwhat was still missing.\n was away from his\n\noffice during those months and I am sure that he had many other things on his\n\nmind.\n However, it is not fair or ethical for him to blame others for\n\nomissions when adequate information / explanation is not provided.\n ( I thought this was one of the basic tenets of teacher training.)\n\n\n\n  Incidentally, I have observed a tendency to insolence in the way\n\n Rob  speaks to me.\n A few weeks ago he tried to blame me because he had not submitted one\n\nof his grades; when I remarked that was the responsibility of the individual\n\nfaculty member he suggested that my job description would have to be revised.\n To me, that smacks of bullying.\n Additionally, last week when I pointed out to him that the first\n\ninternship class this fall was scheduled to meet the day before the\n\nuniversity opened for classes, he said the answer was to put up a sign.\n When I pointed out that would not work because the students wouldn\'t\n\nsee the sign before the 3rd ( because they aren\'t here) now he responded\n\nangrily that I could do as I liked.\n\n\n  On to the question of the contracts.\n As you will recall, I asked you for the forms the individuals are\n\nobliged to fill out when applying for courses and you referred me to  Eva\n\n .\n .\n said she couldn\'t find them in the book, i.e. she\n\ndidn\'t have them.\n went off on holiday and I hoped that she would be able\n\nto find them when she returned.\n How can this information disappear?\n I was given a small number of the forms - where were / are the\n\nothers.\n , I explained that I had\n\nnot been able to obtain proper forms containing the information but that I\n\nwould call each of the individuals that afternoon and gather the information\n\nall over again.\n She responded that I shouldn\'t have to do that and to leave the\n\npapers with her - which I did. \n\n  After your remarks late on, I think, Thursday afternoon I went\n\nover to speak to  Linda Gomez  on the Friday morning to check on the\n\nsituation, and she said there was no need to worry because it was a form\n\nletter sent to 30 departments.\n She said, further, that she\'d never heard anything about the\n\n&dollar;15,000 amount that  Ben  had claimed we were being sued for!\n\n\n  One other point I would like to touch on is that the memo seems\n\nto suggest that I spend all my time on the more interesting tasks and leave\n\nthe boring ones.\n I do lots of dull, boring inputting and I would hardly describe\n\nhaving to calm down students who are threatening to pull out of the programme\n\nand abandon the field entirely because of how they perceive their treatment\n\nat the hands of full-time faculty, as interesting or pleasant.\n As another seasoned, mature member of our Certificate programme\n\nexplained to me, she didn\'t feel that there needed to be quite so much \'ego-bruising\'\n\nin TESL classrooms.\n In today\'s retention-conscious climate of trying to keep numbers up\n\nand students in programmes, I believe that this is a question that must be\n\naddressed if we are to try to maintain our reputation as the " best TESL\n\nprogramme in the country". \n\n  In conclusion, an extra large amount of my energy this summer has\n\ngone into calming, placating and fence-mending.\n I find no pleasure or interest in this but do it because someone\n\nmust.  \n\n\n\n  1.\n I am appalled at the memo you received.\n I do not believe that Admissions, if they were unhappy, would not\n\ncontact the Centre, in an attempt to negotiate changes, before complaining\n\nhigher. \n\n  2.\n In response to the above, I think that it is necessary to point out\n\nthat delays into July and August are the result of  own\n\nomissions, and they cannot, therefore, complain that they have not been\n\nproperly treated.\n Indeed, they have been very kindly treated in that their applications\n\nhave not been rejected out-of-hand when official government deadlines have\n\nbeen missed. \n\n  On the other hand, when people in Admissions insist on giving out\n\nincorrect information, such as it being acceptable for part-time applicants\n\nto apply as late as July 15th which they have this year, then it is clearly\n\nnot our responsibility. \n\n  treatment is\n\nour bottom line, I think it should be emphasized that I have been ordered to\n\ncut back on time spent with them.\n My own approach has always been to bear in mind that they are making\n\nor planning to make a major investment of time and money when they enter our\n\nprogramme.\n If we were going to invest from &dollar;5000-6000 a year, surely we\n\nwould expect to be given more than 10-15 minutes from a salesperson.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd451fe91-ea81-46a6-ac60-d7e37d714e5a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.733551+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9836969971656799, 'non_english_score': 0.01630300283432007}
{'text': 'I am very pleased to write this Letter of Recommendation on behalf\n\nof Ms.  Sandra Hurley  , Dr.  Nicholas Joyce  , Mr. \n\nSebastian Herrera  and Ms.  Sarah Poletto  .\n impresses me as being an\n\nexciting and innovative venture with the potential for success. \n\n  During the past seven months I have called upon this creative team\n\non several occasions to assist me in presentations made to various groups:\n\nthe Partners in Industry Breakfast hosted by the Faculty; the orientation\n\nseminars for English and French CEGEP advisors; the live video conference\n\npresentation to   La conférence intérnationale sur\n\nla technologie et l\'éducation européene   in\n\nBlois, France; and, most recently, the Faculty\'s Spring Convocation ceremony\n\nat  Place des Arts  . \n\n  All of these presentations required being able to communicate\n\nmessages clearly and powerfully to diverse audiences, and I was impressed by\n\nthe team\'s ability to grasp quickly the distinct objectives in each case and\n\nto develop an accurate and creative interpretation of the information to be\n\nconveyed.\n Their technical abilities in computer-integrated media design and\n\nproduction and their intrinsic artistic ability were indispensable to the\n\nsuccess which each of these presentations gained.\n Complementing this technical and creative competence was their total\n\ndedication and readiness to complete the task, often within very short time\n\nframes. \n\n  I have been extremely satisfied at all times with the\n\nprofessionalism and expertise exhibited by Ms.  Hurley  , Dr. \n\nJoyce  , Mr.  Herrera  and Ms.  Poletto  .\n I recommend them highly and urge you to lend whatever support you can\n\nto their project. \n\n \n\n\n\n  I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation on behalf of\n\n Manuel Salvatore  , who has applied for admission to the Department\n\nof Communication Studies. \n\n  for the last two months subsequent\n\nto his father\'s request that I meet with him to see if I could help orient\n\nhim in his university studies.\n\n\n  expressed to me his desire to pursue studies in\n\nthe area of communications and his interest in applying to the department.\n I made him aware of the procedure for application and explained to\n\nhim the necessity to know exactly what our program is about and to that end,\n\nadvised that he visit the department to talk with our students to get a\n\nbetter feeling for the nature of our program. \n\n  on several occasions thereafter to give him\n\nmy feedback on his application.\n I did not see the portfolio that he submitted nor do I know who his\n\nreferees are.\n I did read his letter of intention, which he drafted without any\n\ninput on my part, and I made some minor editorial recommendations.\n I also asked him to provide me with a term / research paper he had\n\nwritten recently so that I could get a sense of his ability to do research,\n\norganize his thoughts and articulate them intelligently.\n He submitted to me a paper he wrote for an Art History class at\n\n  l\'Université de Lune   . \n\n  I explain all this in order to provide you with some background\n\nfor my input.\n This letter is written in the context of the process I put him\n\nthrough which allows me, I believe, to provide a more informed\n\nrecommendation. \n\n \n\n are poor, quite poor.\n He explained to me that they are a reflection of his lack of\n\nmotivation for the course of study in which he is currently engaged while\n\nwaiting to get into the program which corresponds to his interests.\n\n\n  The one thing that does tend to make me give him the benefit of\n\nthe doubt, though slight, are his marks at   Coll&egrave;ge Pierre\n\n  .\n This is an extremely demanding institution in the French tradition\n\nand I noticed that  Manuel  , for the greater part, held his marks up\n\nwell in comparison to his peers at  Pierre  .\n He is mostly on average with the group and in some cases, above\n\naverage, which leads me to believe that his intellectual aptitudes are\n\ngreater that what his  UdeL  marks reflect. \n\n  I was impressed with his letter of intention, both for its form\n\nand content.\n I found his written English to be extremely acceptable for a person\n\nwho has been through the French education system.\n In addition, he manifested in this letter a good understanding of\n\nwhat the department does and how that fits in with his personal aspirations.\n\n\n\n  In addition, I believe that he is the kind of student who can do\n\nwell in our department.\n He strikes me as being a creative and sensitive individual who would\n\nflourish in our environment.\n , he certainly\n\nhas the leadership and teamwork qualities essential to make a positive\n\ncontribution to both the department and subsequently the profession.\n Finally, he is an articulate, pleasant and, on the basis of what I\n\nhave been able to observe, resourceful individual whose multicultural\n\nbackground and experience would be an asset for fellow students and\n\nprofessors alike. \n\n  be\n\nconsidered for admission to the department and I am ready to provide whatever\n\nadditional information you may require. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n  I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation on behalf of\n\n Simona Ronchi  , who has applied for the position of Commissioner of\n\nthe  Missa Institute  in Italy. \n\n  since 1982, when she was an\n\nundergraduate student in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics\n\nand I was Dean of Humanities at  Capital University  , Montreal,\n\nCanada. \n\n  was an outstanding student of Italian language\n\nand literature.\n Well-respected by her professors and student colleagues, she also\n\nplayed a leading role in the life of the department.\n She starred in several Italian theater productions of works by\n\nGoldoni and proved to be an able and eloquent spokesperson for her\n\nconstituency. \n\n  became involved\n\nwith the  Italian Commercial Group  in Canada and quickly rose to the\n\nposition of director-general which she occupies today.\n Here again, I had the pleasure of collaborating with her between 1988\n\nand 1992 during which time I occupied the position of  Quebec Envoy \n\nin Italy.\n Posted in Rome, with the responsibility for the operations in all of\n\nItaly, I worked closely with  Simona  in the organization of major\n\neconomic, cultural and institutional missions and events between Quebec and\n\nItaly.\n Forums\n\nItalie-Québec  "  organized in 1989 ( Quebec) and 1991 (\n\nItaly). \n\n  These events included the participation of a large number of\n\nrepresentatives from the economic, political, educational and institutional\n\ndomains.\n \'s organizational abilities proved invaluable in\n\nhelping the  Quebec Envoys  in Italy provide for all the participants\n\nthe most comprehensive and meaningful program of visits possible. \n\n  has gained the recognition and respect of\n\nthe leaders of the economic, cultural, educational and institutional circles\n\nin Quebec and in key areas in Italy such as Rome and Milan.\n An excellent organizer, an articulate communicator in three languages\n\nand a natural leader, she possesses the skill and the poise necessary to\n\nnavigate easily in high circles on both sides of the Atlantic. \n\n  I believe she would be an exciting choice as Commissioner of the\n\n Missa Institute  in Italy and I have no doubt that she would be able\n\nto meet this challenge with great success. \n\n  For all these reasons, I recommend her without hesitation for\n\nthis position and I would be pleased to answer any questions that you may\n\nhave. \n\n \n\n\n\n  , I am very pleased to write this letter\n\nof recommendation on behalf of Ms.  Kristina Teddiman  in her\n\napplication for a  Wonder University  fellowship.\n I have known her for three-and-a-half years in my capacity of Dean of\n\nthe Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science. \n\n  was the Faculty\'s Communications Officer from\n\nJune 1993 to November 1995.\n Her duties were diverse and required that she demonstrate\n\nflexibility, imagination and the ability to balance a number of projects at\n\nany given time.\n Among her duties, she was responsible for researching the Faculty\n\npresentations to senior administration, industrial and government research\n\npartners, CEGEP advisors, and others.\n These presentations were always highly effective and well-received.\n\n\n\n  left her position to return to full-time\n\nstudies in Fall of 1995; however, she has continued to work in the Faculty on\n\na part-time basis and is currently the Co-ordinator of our Native Access to\n\nEngineering program as well as the Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate\n\nTechnical Writing courses.\n While working in the Faculty she has always been well-organized and\n\nhighly committed to her work.\n These attributes lead me to believe she stands to succeed in any\n\nendeavour she chooses to undertake. \n\n \n\nKristina  possesses an exciting complement to the work she is currently\n\npursuing in Media Studies.\n As you know, she also completed the Diploma in Communication Studies\n\nwhere she did outstanding work and proved her aptitude in this area.\n I believe people who have the flexibility to bridge the " hard" and "\n\nsoft" disciplines are a rare minority.\n The insights they gain from these two rather different academic and\n\nprofessional cultures will prove to be extremely valuable and important in\n\nthe ever-evolving economy that is currently upon us.\n As such, persons who demonstrate that kind of aptitude should be\n\nstrongly and vigorously supported by this university. \n\n  to you very\n\nhighly and trust the fellowship committee will give her application the most\n\nserious consideration.\n Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate\n\nto contact me. \n\n \n\n\n\n  It gives me a great pleasure indeed to write this letter of\n\nrecommendation for Ms.  Jane Petro  in support of her application to\n\nthe Ph.D. program in Modern Thought and Literature at  Rutherford \n\nUniversity. \n\n  for the past three years, ever since\n\nshe enrolled in  Capital  \'s Communication Studies program.\n This program is a leader of its kind in North America, has very high\n\nstandards, and accepts only students with excellent academic standing. \n\n  proved to be among the brightest in\n\nthe freshmen class and soon became a top student in the program.\n For many of my colleagues who have taught her, she was without doubt\n\nthe best student they had ever had the privilege to teach.\n Her record both as a student and as a Teaching Assistant speaks for\n\nitself. \n\n  was never in any of my classes, I have had\n\nnumerous occasions to meet with her.\n My discussions with her were always for me highly informative and\n\ntypically marked, on  Jane  \'s part, by creative insight, serious\n\nreflection, sense of purpose, and \x96 importantly \x96 a very pleasant\n\ndisposition.\n She is a person who will be successful as a student anywhere she goes\n\nand will enrich any environment in which she finds herself.\n \'s\n\nbeing awarded last year The  Capital  Medal which goes to an\n\nundergraduate graduating student who has displayed distinctive leadership\n\nability through both academic and non-academic achievements and has won the\n\noutstanding commendation of his / her fellows and of the faculty. \n\n  University ( Ph.D. Classics,\n\n1972) and therefore as someone obviously familiar with the institution, its\n\ntradition, standards and the excellent quality of education offered, I can\n\nhardly think of a place more conducive to the development of this outstanding\n\nperson.\n I cannot think of any limitations, intellectual or other, that would\n\nprevent her continuing to be an excellent student capable of producing\n\nfirst-rate, creative, and important scholarship. \n\n  to you in the highest\n\nterms and trust the admissions committee will give her application the most\n\nserious consideration.\n

{'text': 'I have been a member of Amnesty International for over 10 years.\n My concern for human rights and justice has prompted me to write you -\n\nabout the lack thereof in Rwanda, and about what we are doing or not doing\n\nabout it.\n Rwanda seems to have dropped out of the news lately.\n But unfortunately, in this case, no news does not mean good news.\n According to Amnesty, those responsible for the massacre ( April-July\n\n1994) of approximately 500,000 ( ! ) people, Tutsis mostly, have not yet been\n\nbrought to justice. \n\n  I would like to see our government take a greater role in assuring\n\nthat the perpetrators of these horrific killings are arrested and tried for\n\ntheir crimes.\n Please pressure the United Nations to assist Rwandan authorities in\n\nidentifying and bringing these people to justice.\n I support Amnesty\'s call for the immediate establishment of an\n\ninternational criminal tribunal and I hope that you will offer all the\n\nsupport needed for such a project. \n\n  Thank-you for taking the time to read my letter and for your\n\nattention to this matter.\n\n\n\n\n  , I am a long-time supporter of Amnesty -\n\nI write letters, mail postcards, send donations as often as I can.\n But I will not be sending your Holiday Cards because I don\'t feel\n\nAmnesty should be putting my donation money towards supplying " gifts" to its\n\nsupporters.\n I don\'t like being manipulated, either - it is very obvious that "\n\ngifts" like these are designed to play upon people\'s feelings of guilt and\n\nobligation\n " Thanks for the cards.\n ) . I\n\nresent being the object of such a cheap strategy. \n\n  If Amnesty wants to sell Christmas cards, why not be honest about\n\nit and offer the potential buyer the option of exercising his or her choice?\n I would be pleased to purchase cards ( that were to my taste) from\n\nAmnesty, but I do not wish to receive any more unsolicited " gift" items in\n\nthe mail. \n\n  Thank-you for understanding my point of view.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nNovember   20, 1995) you sent to my note concerning Bill C-68 on gun\n\ncontrol ( you are the only senator who took the time to respond).\n\n\nMehta  \'s speech ( June 20, 1995) - a very thoughtful and well-argued\n\npresentation.\n In spite of such compelling arguments against the legislation, I was\n\npleased that the bill passed.\n spoke of (\n\nprograms for youth, for the unemployed, for women, community policing, better\n\nlaw enforcement, etc.) are essential - but in conjunction with a\n\ncomprehensive nation-wide program of gun registration.\n We can do both.\n We have the resources - I\'m thinking of the billions that are spent\n\non " defence" and the subsidizing of arms manufacturers.\n Maybe if we started a bit of " gun control" in these areas, too...\n\n\n\n  Now I have a favour to ask of you.\n Mehta\n\n \'s speech ( I filled mine with underlinings and margin notes!), as well\n\nas a copy of an equally well-argued speech from one of the senators in favour\n\nof gun control.\n I hope this is not too much of an imposition on your time, but I\n\nwould very much appreciate receiving transcripts of these speeches so I could\n\nuse them in my advanced-level adult English reading class as good examples of\n\nformal argumentation.\n I\'m sure my students would find the subject matter good fodder for\n\ndebate as well! \n\n  very much.\n\n\n\n\n  , Received your letter not long\n\nago, and, yes, I am still interested in participating in the study - I have a\n\nveritable multitude of letters to choose from!\n Personal letters include those to individual friends / relatives as\n\nwell as our annual Christmas newsletters: business letters are those I\'ve\n\nwritten to various government ministers about environmental / peace / tax\n\nissues.\n I don\'t know if that type of correspondence would be of interest to\n\nyou.\n\n\n \n\n Canadian English   - would you prefer a photocopy ( 36 pp.) or a\n\ncopy on diskette?\n I work in IBM and my diskette copy was done in Word Perfect 4.1.\n Let me know and I\'ll send the copy to you as soon as I can.\n However, I\'m off on holiday ( sun and sand and sloth!) as of the 23rd\n\nMarch and won\'t be back until just after Easter; won\'t have time to send you\n\nanything until we get back. \n\n  .\n I had the pleasure of supervising one of her teaching practica.\n\n\n  Looking forward to hearing from you again.\n\n\n\n\n  , I would like to express my support\n\nfor the statement that your predecessor, Mr.  Drolet  , made last\n\nNovember in favour of a Canadian ban on landmines: he said that  "\n\nCanada should lead the world by destroying its own stockpile of landmines and\n\ndeclaring a total ban on the production, export and use of the weapons"\n\n and that the government  " ought to review our policy"\n\n with respect to landmines.\n\n\n  However, Canada has been and still is contributing to the\n\nneedless suffering of hundreds of thousands of people ( civilians, mostly\n\nchildren) who are killed or maimed every year by landmines.\n Not only do we permit the manufacture of these weapons ( or weapons\n\nparts) in Canada, but we also subsidize armaments manufacturers through loans\n\nand tax breaks.\n Canada has declared support for a global ban, but we have yet to\n\nadopt a domestic landmines ban - the Minister of Defence even said last\n\nSeptember that our armed forces still want to keep the option of landmine use\n\nopen. \n\n  Isn\'t it time to put an end to this kind of double-talk?\n Every delay in applying a ban adds to the suffering of innocent\n\npeople who are being killed and injured by the thousands.\n \'s\n\nstatements and ensure that legislation is passed so that Canada will indeed "\n\nlead the world" by totally banning landmines and their manufacture.\n I would like to know what the government is doing to implement and\n\nenforce a comprehensive landmines ban.\n ( I would hope that this ban would also include a ban on\n\nmanufacturing component parts of landmines.)\n When can we expect such a policy to come into effect?\n I would also like to know what Canada is doing to pressure other\n\ncountries to adopt their own domestic bans in order to eventually achieve an\n\ninternational ban. \n\n  Thank-you for taking the time to read this and for your attention\n\nto this important issue.\n\n\n \n\n\n  Please find enclosed a copy of the letter I have sent to the\n\nMinister of External Affairs regarding the issue of a Canadian landmines ban.\n I am very concerned about the use of landmines the world over ( so\n\nmany innocent people mutilated and killed and so much otherwise productive\n\nland gone to waste) and about Canada\'s role in this problem. \n\n  I hope that you will seriously reconsider your last year\'s\n\nstatement to the effect that the Canadian armed forces needed to retain the\n\noption of landmine use and that you will work with the new Minister of\n\nForeign Affairs to ensure that a Canadian landmines ban is enacted. \n\n  Thank you very much for your attention to this important issue.\n\n\n \n\n\n  Hello once again.\n This time it\'s my turn to apologize for not answering sooner - we\n\nwere away on vacation and then there was the garden to get back into shape (\n\nmy veggies are important to me!).\n I do hope it\'s not too late to send you my " stuff".\n I\'ve enclosed a copy of the paper I mentioned to you as well as\n\nsamples of some of my business and personal letters - and receipts for\n\nphotocopy and mailing expenses. \n\n  Setting up the ICE is a huge undertaking, and it\'s exciting for\n\nme to be a part of it, however small.\n But I can\'t help but wonder just how you\'re going to analyze all that\n\ndata! \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n  We are profoundly dismayed by your government\'s recent decision\n\nto continue and to expand low-level training flights over the Innu lands of\n\nNitassinan.\n In spite of numerous testimonies from the local people and\n\nenvironmentalists alike, your government continues to regard the\n\nenvironmental and social consequences as less important than financial gain.\n The environmental consequences of this decision are however very\n\nserious: increasing the flights means increasing the sonic and chemical\n\npollution of the biophysical environment of a vast area with the result that\n\nhuman and animal life there is seriously disrupted, so seriously that the\n\nsurvival of Innu culture itself is threatened. \n\n  You are no doubt aware that the military, world-wide, consumes\n\nvast amounts of resources and produces enormous quantities of toxic\n\npollutants.\n The U.S. military, for example, produces more toxic waste than the\n\nfive largest multinational chemical companies combined, nearly a ton every\n\nminute.\n An F-16 jet taking off for a regular training mission consumes 3,400\n\nlitres of fuel, and in less than half an hour the plane uses almost twice as\n\nmuch fuel as the average U.S. motorist does over one year, approximately 1300\n\nlitres; an F-15 jet consumes about 900 litres of fuel in one minute.\n And to think that the Canadian government is happily contributing to\n\nsuch problems by agreeing to increase the number and intensity of low-level\n\ntraining flights over Nitassinan!  \n\n  The environmental impact of the training flights over Nitassinan\n\nis not simply a local issue: the use ( and abuse) of world resources is\n\neveryone\'s concern.\n Pollutants don\'t respect political boundaries!\n We trust that you, as Minister of the Environment, are as concerned\n\nas we are about the negative impacts of these training flights.\n We would like to know your position on this question and we would\n\nlike to know what you did to speak out against the decision to increase in\n\nmilitary flights over Nitassinan. \n\n  Thank-you very much for reading our letter and for taking the\n\ntime to respond to our concerns. \n\n \n\nComité de l\'environnement de  Timbuktoo   \n\n  , Minister of National Defence,\n\nOttawa  Christopher Boswell  , Director of Innu Rights and the\n\nEnvironment, Nitassinan International Campaign for the Innu and the Earth,\n\nToronto  \n\n \n\n\n  and I work as a teacher of\n\nEnglish as a second language here in the province of Quebec ( Canada) and I\n\nhave been a member of Amnesty International for over ten years.\n My concern for human rights has prompted me to write you about the\n\ncase of Dr.  Ahmed Rahini  , a trade union leader in your country who\n\nwas arrested on November 7 of last year and sentenced to three  imprisonment because of his trade union activities, activities such as\n\nurging workers to ask for a pay raise.\n These activities, according to Amnesty reports, were both legal and\n\npeaceful, but were seen by the authorities in your country as " inciting"\n\nothers to destroy the government. \n\n  a prisoner of conscience,\n\narrested and imprisoned for the non-violent expression of his beliefs and\n\nconvicted in a trial which was unfair and even contravened the Criminal\n\nProcedure Law of your country ( for example the defence was not given\n\nsufficient time to prepare nor were they allowed access to important\n\ndocuments or expert witnesses). \n\n  be immediately and\n\nunconditionally released. \n\n  Thank-you, Sir, for taking the time to read my letter and for\n\nyour kind intervention in this matter.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b385f988-1127-441f-8680-1d9a69736653', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.735999+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9718629121780396, 'non_english_score': 0.02813708782196045}

different from the original which was printed. \n\n  This is the first time that revisions have not been made in the\n\nyear-and-a-half since I started sending articles about academic programmes\n\nback to source for verification.\n I can see how it happened, and I assure you that it won\'t happen\n\nagain. \n\n  However, I must tell you that the article was sent back to the\n\nCentre to have factual errors corrected, not to be completely rewritten.\n The version you sent back was a dry report, not a newspaper story;\n\nthe version  Alice Foreman  wrote gave a profile of the Centre which\n\nI\'m sure many people read with approval and interest. \n\n  There were some factual corrections in your fax which didn\'t get\n\ninto print, for which I am very sorry.\n I would like to offer the following alternatives.\n One is to print a small correction in the January 12 issue which\n\nincludes such items as the correct age of the Centre, and so on. \n\n  Another alternative, which I think would be more appropriate, is\n\nto incorporate the accurate information into the next article that  MER\n\n prints about research at the Centre.\n As I think I\'ve said to you on the phone, we have neglected the\n\nCentre\'s important work too long, and are trying to make up for it by writing\n\nindividual stories about some of the professors and their research. \n\n  Many thanks for your help in making the Centre\'s work known.\n I\'m sorry for any embarrassment this incident has caused you, and I\n\nhope we can continue to work together.  \n\n \n\n\n  I am so pleased that you thought of sending me the address by Mr.\n\n Linderman  .\n\n\n \n\nappears, last year\'s graduating class will be " old news," and my meagre\n\neight pages will be crammed with conferences and other events held over the\n\nsummer, plus orientation sessions for the coming year. \n\n  I always make a special effort to feature a number of\n\nrepresentative students in the last issue of the year, which is published in\n\nearly June.\n This takes considerable preparation, as you can imagine, and I assign\n\na reporter at least a month in advance.\n I always call the Centre for Mature Students, and get excellent\n\nsuggestions. \n\n  .\n While the photo of him didn\'t get into the paper, the story caught\n\nthe attention of a local television station, and they

or three articles by interns were published, and I enjoyed my\n\ncontact with the students. \n\n  Assuming that you want to continue with the project, I have a\n\nsuggestion.\n What distinguishes interns from regular freelancers is that they\n\nspend a little time in the office, and go over their stories and ideas in\n\nsome detail with the editor.\n I would like to see interns for at least an hour on Thursday\n\nafternoons, and I really can\'t deviate much from that schedule when I\'m in\n\nproduction,  so students with no time then should be passed over  .\n\n\n\n  Here\'s my suggested schedule of working Thursdays, aimed at\n\ngetting their articles published in the issue of the following week: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  they should call me a week\n\nbefore their internship is to start  .\n ( Intern number 3 should call me in December.)\n It\'s easier for them to reach me than vice versa.\n plans changed ( one had no time;\n\none dropped out of Journalism), and by the time

have an " employment\n\nauthorization" which costs &dollar;125 and can be arranged through the\n\nInternational Students Office.\n If you have a chance, would you pass this information on to

{'text': 'Nov.\n\n  November   1996) \n\n\n  While separation of Church and State is a concept which has been\n\nassimilated in Canada, and we may agree that the government should not\n\ninterfere in religion, and although some may feel that in Quebec the clergy\n\nhave historically aroused resentment by exercising wide authority on matters\n\nboth religious and secular, still it is both false and destructive to hold\n\nthat faith and religious truth should play no role in interpreting political\n\nevents, or that the Church should have nothing to say in the affairs which\n\ndetermine our lives.\n There occur from time to time political events and situations which\n\ninvolve focused and easily discerned spiritual values.\n The roles of the Churches in Nazi Germany has been much written about.\n Their roles in Yugoslavia and in Ireland will eventually be studied in\n\nthe same way.\n Christendom is on display, and not all the Churches appear to have\n\nbeen true to themselves.\n We would suggest that Quebec is, at this time, involved in one of\n\nthose moments where the Churches, and specifically the Catholic Church, are\n\nchallenged to show their colours .. \n\n  All Quebecers are suffering the same prolonged uncertainty, and\n\nsame experience of endless conflict.\n But there may be a value in presenting this spiritual malaise from\n\nthe specific viewpoint of English Speaking Catholics because we are a\n\nminority, and because we may experience these years somewhat differently than\n\nwill the French-speaking majority.\n Moreover it is important that English-speaking Catholics understand\n\nand feel that the Church in its hierarchy is not indifferent to their\n\nspiritual welfare, but is informed and is actively interested in it, even\n\nthough they are a minority in the Quebec Church.\n For this reason we turn to the Bishops of Quebec for leadership, and\n\nwe trust that just as English-speaking and French-speaking Bishops cooperate\n\nin the Church, so they will be able to lead the various parishes and other\n\ngroupings of the faithful to those resources of our heritage which we share\n\nand which enable us to respect and love one another. \n\n  It must be said that the religious education which we have\n\nreceived was centered on self-denial, on obligations to the Church, on purity\n\nof life, and on loving one\'s brother and sister.\n There was little catechesis about political responsibility, about\n\nsocial justice, about community leadership, about patriotism, about violence\n\nand warfare.\n\n\n\n  Patriotism is an important feeling, and a major ethical\n\ncommitment.\n For a person who has lost all sense of God and religion, patriotism\n\ncan easily absorb religious values and lead to political fanaticism.\n We have seen even secular culture criticizing patriotism, because the\n\nfirst half of this century was marked by its excesses.\n But for people of faith, patriotism is an important formative value\n\nthrough which an individual breaks out beyond instinctive love of self and\n\nfamily and race based on blood, and beyond interpersonal love of men and\n\nwomen, to wider horizons of commitment and charity.\n Patriotic values lead very naturally to the horizons of love of God,\n\nand we can see that mankind has regularly linked the name of God to national\n\nexpressions of loyalty.\n This kind of love is powerful, and its relation to love of God is a\n\ncrucial point where religious faith can be confused with idolatry.\n Reflection, spiritual discernment, and clear instruction in this area\n\nare badly needed. \n\n  English-speaking Catholics have a specific problem in this\n\nregard.\n Often we come from families which, however rooted in Quebec, have\n\nalso lived in two or more provinces in Canada over some generations.\n " in\n\ncelebrating Quebec, but they also burst with pride when we sing " Oh Canada"\n\nat the Olympic games, or at flag-raisings.\n\n\nnewpapers   newspapers   bring us daily stories from right\n\nacross Canada, and our general image of this countries includes Provinces\n\nwith their friendly rivalries.\n Our feelings of patriotism and national pride are centered on Canada\n\nand the Canadian flag and institutions.\n The threat to simply take Canadian citizenship from us, along with\n\nthe relentless defamation we hear daily in public discourse about " the rest\n\nof Canada" and all its institutions, is a radical shock.\n It is very similar to a threat to take our family away from us and a\n\npublic defamation of our dear ones.\n This is not a financial theft.\n\n\n  St. Paul taught that there was no longer any more to be Jew or\n\nGreek, but only followers of Jesus.\n And it is true that some times the religious conversion attendant\n\nupon " finding Jesus" does imply a leaving of one\'s native land.\n Should this be the asceticism recommended to English-speaking\n\nCatholics?\n In the book of Ruth, Naomi is praised for leaving her Moabite origin\n\nand becoming a Jew in Israel out of love for her mother-in-law.\n Is this a model of spirituality to recommend in Quebec?\n This is not a clever question.\n It is a choice which separation plans for our future.\n The alternatives could, in a very few years, be either to leave\n\nQuebec, or to prepare for violence in Quebec.\n Our priests say nothing of this.\n They will need the guidance of the larger Church, and specifically of\n\nthe Bishops, to sort this question out. \n\n  The problem is made more acute in that our friends and often our\n\nimmediate family have left for other provinces, or are planning to leave.\n Many of us live in areas where virtually all the houses carry " for\n\nsale" signs, because even those who are not leaving now are hoping\n\ndesperately to sell their house ( at a 15 to 20% loss!), so that they can be\n\nfree to leave at a later date.\n This is not just one bad year to get through, and shrug off.\n It has been going on so long now that most of us take it as a solid\n\nreality.\n No one wants to leave, and most cannot leave because of financial and\n\nemployment limitations.\n Many of our families have parents and grand parents for generations\n\nback buried here, and the choice is to leave and be cut off from our roots,\n\nor to stay and be cut off from our future.\n This is a bit of death, and a bit of torture, and over time it\n\nbecomes despair.\n What hope can the Church offer, drawing upon its spirituality and\n\ntheological resources? \n\n\n\n One natural response is anger at the source of this suffering.\n Anger is an important energy for fighting evil.\n However, we also know another anger, the anger which lurks in our\n\npsyches and threatens our self-control, disturbs our capacity for judgement\n\nand fills our minds.\n Scripture compares it to a lion which crouches at the door wanting to\n\nconsume us, but which we can and must conquer. ( Gen 4:6-7)\n The media often equate anger with courage, and make it the path to\n\nvictory.\n Of course conflict sells newspapers, and many individuals find\n\npersonal advantage or gratification in inciting anger and hatred among their\n\nfriends or among their enemies.\n And one recurring pathology of crowds is the lust to feel they are\n\ncast in the role of victims, or of avengers.\n One hears this tone now on the radio, both French and English, every\n\nday, and worsening from month to month.\n And yet it is hardly mentioned in the pulpit.\n The silence in the Church about this is astonishing.\n\n\n\n  Another problem is the loss of public trust.\n Society is based on mutual confidence, on the expectation of truth\n\nand justice in public forums.\n The loss of religion and of self-transcending values in Quebec has\n\nnaturally    weakened   expectation of public\n\ntruth and public trust.\n Moreover, the incredible mushrooming of public communication through\n\nmodern media, communication which is 70% fiction, 10% information, and 20%\n\ndeception through various kinds of advertising and news as entertainment, has\n\nflooded our intelligence to the point where we have learned to float on\n\nsystematic scepticism.\n When you can never get to the truth of anything, you train yourself\n\nto live without it.\n But in Quebec the drive for independence has so shaped political\n\ndebate as to exacerbate this scepticism to a dangerous point.\n Independence apparently won\'t be achieved or rejected by simple\n\nnegotiation or honest argument.\n It requires constant posturing for leverage in bargaining position,\n\nconstant manipulation of language and " spinning" of news stories, constant\n\nblurring of lines between politics and law, constant tricking of the public.\n\n\n\n  Deception is better than violence.\n But it has been going on for so many years that we have lost track of\n\nwhat is normal, and have come to accept that political debate be a special\n\nexercise in suspended disbelief.\n Nobody trusts public statements or facts.\n Instead, we systematically look for the deception, and base our\n\ndecisions on instincts rather than reason.\n We no longer know or even want to know.\n Once again, this is not a sickness to be endured for a month or two,\n\nlike the Presidential election in the United States.\n Our poor brains have been so occupied and rotted in this exercise,\n\nthat either apathy or despair seems to be the lot of anybody who reads \n\n  newspapers   or watches news on television on\n\na regular basis.\n It is no wonder that the light of eternal truths often fail to touch\n\nbrains exhausted and steeped in endless lies.\n This is not a small matter.\n Human capacity for truth, and desire for truth, is one of God\'s\n\ngreatest gifts.\n The pleasures of the mind are the truly human pleasures which\n\nconstitute beatitude in this life.\n There is a profound rage building up over this.\n The media tell us that we are angry at politicians.\n The fact is that the anger is about politicians and media equally.\n In this case, the rage is appropriate.\n\n\n  Has the Church something to offer on the topic of public lying?\n Is political deception a fine art or a moral failure?\n Can the Church articulate a serious ideal of honesty in public\n\ndiscourse?\n Can the Church identify and define real values in society, and ask\n\npoliticians to address these directly and simply?\n Must we allow governments to avoid focusing on the visible problems\n\nof poverty and misery in this city, or the general

{'text': 'This is a letter of support for the Centre of Innovation proposal\n\nof the Coll&egrave;ge de  Belleville  ( CEGEP), currently being\n\nsubmitted by  Nathalie P. Dion  . \n\n  approach to the\n\nuse of LAN & WAN linked computers for collegial education using the French\n\nlanguage to foster: study skills, meta-cognition, French language skills, and\n\nmathematical problem definition skills, by peer interaction - as well as\n\nteacher guidance. \n\n  The project should be of appreciable benefit to the francophone\n\neducational community in Canada, and also to the wider educational community.\n is currently pursuing doctoral\n\nstudies at  Collegial  in this area, and is in touch with Mr. \n\nMarcus Jasper  another doctoral student here who is using a MAC\n\nlaboratory at  Lonsdale  University in  Lothersdale  for a\n\nrelated CSCL ( Computer Supported Collaborative Learning) project involving\n\nfrancophone students.\n of\n\nthe  Université d\'Ontario  did her work using CoSy computer\n\nconferencing to train financial counsellors at scattered branches of the\n\nCaisse Desjardins so that we have a base of recent research in CSCL to share\n\nwith Ms.  Dion  and the Coll&egrave;ge de  Belleville  .\n In short there is a network of support and diffusion ( which also of\n\ncourse will involve  Maurice LaFleur  \'s CECM A.I.S. Centre) to ensure\n\nthe transfer of educational benefits from this new  Belleville  Apple\n\nCentre for Innovation. \n\n  Although some interesting collaborative learning support software\n\nfor Appletalk and WAN network use does exist ( such as  Gertrude Hall  \'s\n\nREP GRIDS, and  Tremblay  \'s TIMBUKTU) nothing made to order for the\n\nfrancophone collegial environment is yet available.\n However, constructing suitable CSCL tools, possibly with the new\n\nversion of Hypercard, should be well within the capabilities of the \n\nBelleville  group. \n\n  The aspect of the work that I find to be theoretically most\n\ninteresting relates to the collaborative, or even in a sense collective,\n\nlearning of cohorts.\n It is not merely that you learn what you are are well enough prepared\n\nto almost know already as  Dagneau  pointed out, but also that you\n\nlearn what your cohort of peers almost already knows.\n Collaborative learning in this sense is as much a psycho-social\n\nidentity re-creation based motivational process as a cognitive one.\n at OISE with transformative\n\nadult learning through computer mediated conferencing is perhaps most\n\nrelevant in this respect.) \n\n  has already conducted preliminary\n\nexperiments using PCs on a LAN with e-mail software to support group problem\n\ndefinition and solving processes in mathematics which have produced some\n\ninteresting insights.\n However, the PC e-mail system is too clumsy and too bereft of\n\ngraphics to be adequate for this kind of CSCL research and development\n\nendeavour. \n\n  In summary I think that the proposed centre if created will be\n\nwell used by Ms.  Dion  and her colleagues, and that the knowledge,\n\nand software proto-types that they develop will be made widely available to\n\nthe educational community. \n\n  Hence I strongly endorse this proposal, and will provide whatever\n\nknowledge, contacts, and advice are at my disposal to help them succeed with\n\nit. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n  This letter concerns our, as it were somewhat belated \'beta-test\',\n\nwork with AmigaVision. \n\n  student\n\n  programmer to work with it part time to try out various features\n\nand techniques.\n the results, after about forty hours work spread over two months,\n\nwere very encouraging.\n Our next undertaking will be to produce some lessons for actual use\n\nin various courses. \n\n  With this letter I am sending nine disks which constitute the\n\ndemo-reel we produced for introducing teachers and others to some of the\n\npossibilities of Amiga-vision.\n ( It may be used by your company for any educational or promotional\n\npurpose you see fit.) \n\n  I am also including a letter from our system administrator with\n\nsome short but I think important notes from our student programmers\n\nconcerning difficulties, and added features that they would like in order to\n\nmake AmigaVision authoring more efficient. \n\n  It is becoming clear to us that AmigaVision is not just an\n\nauthoring system, but rather a 4GL ( fourth generation language) with\n\nwide-ranging programming capabilities. \n\n  I was thinking of linking in some dynamic simulations by using\n\nARex but it begins to look as though perhaps we can do the whole job in\n\nAmigaVision, although it would mean creating a lot of new subroutines. \n\n  My own suggestion for an added capability would be the ability to\n\nnest sub-routines within sub-routines.\n Such nesting, or even might one dream: a recursion, capability with\n\nrespect to subroutines would be quite helpful for programming simulations and\n\ngames. \n\n  I have thought of trying to emulate some of the capabilities of\n\nthe simulation program STELLA which we use on Macs, but that may be too\n\ndifficult.\n Also, I am curious to try MAc-ACCESS with AmigaVision\'s execute icon;\n\nhas anyone done that?\n MSdos\n\n  MS-dos   software such as Electronic Workbench via\n\nAmiga-Vision / execute.\n This could be a way of training and / or providing job-aids for users\n\nof an immense variety of software.\n I hope to get a student to do a comparison with Course of Action on\n\nthe Mac as a class project, but have no volunteers yet. \n\n  Overall our initial impression is very favorable ( especially in\n\ncomparison with VIVA) and simple authoring languages such as Pilot. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n  Your Intelligent Instruction Tutor project is of considerable\n\ninterest to us, and we can see a number of possibilities for contributing to\n\nthe project.\n Consequently please keep us on your mailing list, and on the list for\n\nany forthcoming RFPs. \n\n  university graduate programme in\n\nEducational Technology, and  associated Centre for Knowledge\n\nEngineering and System research is very directly involved in the development\n\nof strategies for developing interactive instruction and evaluating learning\n\noutcomes, and in the use of expert-assistant systems for instructional\n\npurposes. \n\n  Donald\n\nSmith  -

{'text': ', currently a student in Modern\n\nLanguages and Literature at the  Eaton  University, has asked me to\n\nwrite a letter of reference to the Canadian Federation of University Women on\n\nher behalf.\n\n\n  She is applying for a Professional Fellowship.\n "\n\nscholarship, potential and personal qualities,"  in this regard. \n\n  Prior to my taking up duties in this position I was a full-time\n\nAssociate Professor in the Department of Communication Studies where  Jude\n\n did her undergraduate degree.\n She is probably the most brilliant student to come through that\n\nDepartment in my twenty-seven years as a teacher there.\n\n\nMedal at her graduation in June of 1996.\n She is the first and only student in our programme to be so honoured.\n This medal, which is not necessarily awarded each year, represents\n\nthe highest honour for an undergraduate student at our University.\n The medal recognizes outstanding achievement, exceptional leadership,\n\ncreativity and substantial service to the outside community. \n\n  In submitting her name for this prestigious award two colleagues\n\nand I contacted each of her previous teachers at this University.\n All of them immediately agreed to write letters of support on her\n\nbehalf and felt privileged to do so.\n\n\n  \'s\n\ndegree is in Communication Studies, the first programme of its kind in Canada\n\nand a recognized leader internationally in scholarship and creativity.\n She came to us with a background in literature and literary\n\ncriticism.\n This afforded her a depth in the analysis and criticism of media and\n\ncommunicative acts.\n It also gave her an appropriate balance in her creative work in film.\n , was reviewed by\n\nthe major Montreal film critic who gave it excellent reviews.\n , is only\n\nfurther testimony to her extraordinary abilities and potential in\n\nscholarship. \n\n  was also hired on two sequential full-time\n\ncontracts to act as teaching assistant in film.\n The students with whom she worked often spoke to me of her\n\noutstanding contribution to them both in her capacity as a teacher and as a\n\nfilmmaker.\n She did and, I am also informed, still commands the respect of both\n\nher fellow students and of her professors. \n\n  She is a delight to work with and I can say, speaking not only\n\nfor myself but her former teachers, that each of us learned as much, if not\n\nmore, from  Jude  as she did from us.\n She has brought renown to the Department of Communication Studies and\n\nto  Collegial  University.\n and\n\nbeyond.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  is applying for a Celanese Canada\n\nInternational Fellowship in order to pursue a post-graduate course of study\n\nin film direction at the National Film School, London, England.\n She has asked me to write this letter on her behalf and I do so with\n\ngreat pleasure and honour. \n\n  since September of 1993.\n She was in the undergraduate programme in Communication Studies at\n\n Collegial  University.\n At the time I was an Associate Professor in the Department.\n I was her teacher in two courses, her supervisor in a directed (\n\nhonours) project and an advisor to her throughout her undergraduate academic\n\ncareer.\n I know her work very well.\n At the time of her graduation I organized with the assistance of\n\neleven of my colleagues, her successful candidacy for the  Collegial \n\nMedal of 1996 - an honour which is not necessarily given each year.\n It was the first time at this University that so many professors of\n\nan individual student had made such a request.\n were not\n\nsurprised.\n \'s graduation in 1996, I have kept in touch with\n\nher on a regular basis in matters regarding her academic and professional\n\nprojects. \n\n  speaks of a " stewardship" of Canadian cultural\n\nmaterial, her plan to attend the National Film School next year, and of her\n\nwork this year at  Eaton  University,  Langwith  College, in\n\nstudying the historical relationship among language, image and symbol.\n Jude\n\nPeters  .\n She has a tremendous intellect and intellectual curiosity.\n Those of us who have worked with her have been constantly struck by\n\nher intricate ability to synthesize and develop nascent conclusions in\n\ninterrelated matters.\n Hence her passion for the relationships among language, imagery and\n\nsymbols and her drive to go to  Eaton  to immerse herself in an\n\nenvironment which allows her to do just that. \n\n  She now plans to direct this energy to the development of film\n\nimagery on an international scale.\n Her choice of the National Film School is particularly apt for it\n\nallows her to build upon one of her many undergraduate strengths for which\n\nthe university recognized her with its medal.\n , won critical\n\npraise from Montreal\'s leading film critic.\n With this second stage, we come to the synthesis of intellect and\n\ncreativity in  Jude  . \n\n  These two stages blend together in a sense of dedication, purpose\n\nand responsibility in  Jude  .\n This is what I understand by her use of the word " stewardship".\n , it is not enough to conceive of a project and\n\nsee it through to fruition.\n She also has the abiding sense of personal and communal\n\nresponsibility for her own acts and thoughts.\n And this quality in her I saw over and over again while she was a\n\nstudent at  Collegial  University.\n I heard it from her fellow students.\n I saw it come to pass in her work with Highland history in\n\nsouth-eastern Ontario.\n And, I heard testimonial after testimonial to this effect from native\n\nand white participants in a documentary  Jude  produced in Northern\n\nQuebec. \n\n  I understand from your own documentation that you are interested\n\nin the applicant\'s academic merit and suitability for the proposed program.\n I believe I have addressed these points above.\n \'s\n\noutstanding undergraduate transcript.\n Her success in this area speaks volumes to her eventual success in\n\nher proposed program at the National Film School, not to mention her\n\ncontribution this year at  Eaton  . \n\n  I find it most encouraging that the Celanese Canada\n\nInternationalist Fellowship provides  " opportunities for\n\ninternational study, or a combination of study / research, or study / work (\n\ninternship)"  for people of academic merit and personal suitability.\n\n\n  was an undergraduate student she was hired on\n\ntwo sequential full-time contracts as teaching assistant in film.\n The students with whom she worked often spoke to me of her\n\noutstanding contribution to them in her capacity as a teacher, filmmaker and\n\nhuman being.\n She did, and I am informed, still commands the deep respect of both\n\nher fellow students and of her professors. \n\n  Her letter of purpose for this fellowship indicates her desire to\n\nwork on the international scale in communication and film media.\n embodies the qualities your fellowship seeks.\n Her entire academic path has been one characterized by a combination\n\nof study, research and work.\n welcomes\n\nchallenges in cross-cultural areas.\n As indicated in my previous comments, this has been a hallmark of her\n\nwork at university and in her personal life as well. \n\n  In closing, I would say that in the evaluation of the applicant\'s\n\nperformance ( number 3 on your reference form) were there a category for top\n\n1%, I would have no hesitation and full justification to locate  Jude \n\nin each of the categories you present in that ranking.\n And I say this having taught a total of over three thousand students\n\nfor twenty-eight years. \n\n  is a delight to work with and I can say, speaking\n\nnot only for myself but for her former teachers as well, that each of us\n\nlearned as much, if not more, from  Jude  as she did from us.\n She has brought renown to this University and she will certainly do\n\nso in her endeavours at  Eaton  and beyond.\n deserves the opportunity to continue her work beyond\n\n Eaton  and I can assure you that she will in this regard also bring\n\ninternational acclaim and honour to our country as well. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  has written to me requesting a letter of\n\nsupport for his application for the position we are advertising.\n I feel quite honoured to do so, especially given the compelling case\n\nfor his candidacy. \n\n  Our field has long recognized International and Intercultural\n\nCommunication as a main thread of study and scholarship.\n This goes back for over half a century.\n comes from this field and has impeccable credentials to\n\nrecommend him very highly as a scholar on the international front.\n However it is not for this reason that I most keenly recommend his\n\nappointment to our Department. \n\n  As academics in the field of Communication we all are aware of\n\nthe central role media and communication play in information, global\n\nawareness and cultural changes.\n , however, we find not only a highly accomplished\n\nscholar in this field, we find a person who clearly integrates scholarship in\n\nthis area with an acutely personal experience of the challenges and problems\n\ncommunication and media now face and will face for the next few decades.\n His letter to the Committee is testimony to that fact.\n This is no small matter.\n To be fortunate enough to find such a scholar allows us, as a\n\nDepartment, to build upon our strengths in the field by welcoming a person\n\nwho simultaneously can operate within objective and subjective areas.\n our Department will have a teacher and scholar who\n\nblends academic rigour with particular insights on the problems at hand\n\nderived from long and fruitful analysis of and presence with the very topics\n\nhe studies.\n Indeed, we have in our own experience with him a proven track record\n\nof my statement. \n\n  His evaluations of teaching at the undergraduate and graduate\n\nlevel are also very persuasive.\n His successful ability to meet those requests and challenges we asked\n\nof him a few years back only serves to underscore the good fortune our\n\nDepartment has in finding a person of his talents in teaching and research.\n\n\n\n  While I was undertaking to direct the MA programme a few years\n\nback and during my term as director, I was often told by colleagues and\n\nstudents of the respect they had for  Ali  .\n I truly believe his departure at the end of his limited term\n\nappointment was a real loss for us.\n We now have a second chance to work with this individual who so\n\nclearly embodies what each of us seeks in a candidate for scholarly\n\nrecognition by those outside our programme and for what we understand as our\n\nphilosophy and direction of Communication Studies. \n\n  As a group we have had several meaningful discussions as to the\n\nfuture of our Department within this University and within the field as a\n\nwhole.\n We spoke about the urgency of developing strategies for\n\nCommunication Studies to contribute meaningfully in areas of global exchange.\n We focused on the development of multi-media projects and global\n\nforms of media and communication.\n we have, given our intent, a person who can\n\ncontribute directly to our own sense of our future and who will bring with\n\nhim a level of international and global respect which we need to move in\n\nthose areas which we have identified.\n .\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n  The following information has now been confirmed at this hour by\n\n Marie Ganier  of  TUP  on behalf of  Chloe Lavigne  (\n\nour regular contact there): \n\n  Sous-commission # 6 will have its first meeting on\n\nWednesday, January 21 and sous-commission #7 will have its first meeting\n\non

Applied Human Science - the old \n\n  Applied   Social   \n\nScience   and Leisure Studies merged; Creative Writing, Chemistry).\n I will be speaking of your interests at that meeting and from there I\n\nwant to sent you one or two items directly for your concern. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n  I wrote to you about two weeks ago to complain about the\n\ninconvenience caused by delayed luggage on my daughter\'s trip to Denver. \n\n  I got a reply today, but the letter and cheque were for someone\n\nelse, Mrs.  Daniella Jones  , reference number is  FP-55-555  .\n Please contact me to tell me whether I should mail the letter and\n\ncheque back to you.\n\n\n  ; my fax number is\n\n 999-9999  .\n I tried to reach you by phone, but couldn\'t get past the automated\n\nsystem. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n  Many thanks for your suggestion about a column on student\n\nachievers. \n\n  I understand the desire for more coverage, but a column is not\n\nnecessarily a good solution.\n In fact, a column tends to ghetto-ize the subject, reducing its\n\nchance of being on the front page or closer to the front of the paper.\n Better, I think, to continue to do full-size features about student\n\nachievers whenever we can, and to include more student items with the\n\nachievements of faculty and staff in " At a Glance." \n\n  As you can see from the enclosed list, student achievers have\n\nbeen featured more prominently in  MER  this year than ever before.\n I look at every item I get about individual students, and almost\n\ninvariably put it in the paper, often as a major article. \n\n  I get such news from professors, secretaries of departments,\n\nnewspaper clippings, student journalists and the achievers themselves, but I\n\ndon\'t get much information from the student associations.\n I would encourage them to pass along any tips about student\n\nnewsmakers, and I\'ll be glad to report on them. \n\n \n\n  P.S. I wonder if you intended your letter of December 7 for\n\npublication on the Letters Page?\n\n\n\n\n \n has volunteered to attend the first meeting\n\nof #6. \n At that time those present will discuss the need ( found at other\n\nuniversities as well) to expand the membership of the sous-commission. \n\n  has asked for two\n\nrepresentatives, including one from Modern Languages. I suggest that  Paul\n\n  also  attend this meeting for the sake of continuity and that\n\n Elle Macpherson  attend since the  TUP  has asked for\n\nrepresentation from Modern Languages.\n I stress that this arrangement is for the first set of meetings ( 6\n\n   and   7) this week. \n\n  would then meet with all five\n\nof us early next week to sort out what our options are and what the  TUP\n\n is proposing. \n\n  know if this is agreeable to\n\nyou ( 5555, Fax 5556).\n ( 5557) with any specific\n\nconcerns you have so that he may represent all our interests at these initial\n\nmeetings as well as possible. \n\n \n\n\n\n  said, yes we are busy - a good thing for\n\npublishers.\n Don\'t hesitate to call if you have any questions while we are\n\nreviewing your manuscript. \n\n  The Ojibwa Community\n\n . \n\n \n\n\n\n  3.\n Perhaps what we need to add in the new mail-out, is that\n\napplications which are not <b> complete </b> by June 15th will not be\n\nconsidered.\n The other point to consider is how much responsibility we have or\n\ndo not have to assume in chasing after students who do not complete their\n\nfiles on their own.\n In addition, of course, this does not address the question of\n\nwhether or not we will have met our quota. \n\n  4.\n You will recall that two years ago when I was driven off to a\n\nmedical leave that all the other departmental staff who spent extra time\n\nattempting to fill my job, were rewarded with commensurate time off, not to\n\nmention buckets of praise.\n This year, however, there has been no mention at all of the extra\n\ntime the rest of us have had to put in to cover for  Janelle  .\n For example, had I not had to play receptionist so much this week,\n\nI would not have had to work from 1.10a.m. this morning until now ( 5:29a.m.)\n\npreparing for my meeting with graduation and for Admissions! \n\n  I do not foresee that we will be back at full staff for some\n\ntime.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'c978723c-0d47-4c6c-b2f2-14a1c610bbb9', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.742517+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9734483361244202, 'non_english_score': 0.026551663875579834}

the reference department, I have worked to establish a\n\nrapport with professors in various departments to encourage their\n\nrecommendations for titles, while maintaining a selection range appropriate\n\nto our market. \n\n  is mainly concerned with textbooks, I feel\n\nmy university background ( both as a student and an employee at the\n\nUniversity of  Langford  ) would also be useful

appreciate the fact that large publishing companies offer the\n\nopportunity for change and advancement within the company itself. \n\n  I am independent and well organized and would bring to the\n\nposition of publisher sales representative a sincere interest in books, as\n\nwell a depth of insight into the " book business" from both the customer\'s\n\nand seller\'s perspective which can

being a dry, narrow account from one person\'s\n\nperspective, this book is a reflection of a generation, and its accuracy has\n\nled one professor to consider it for supplemental reading in his

office\n\nwith requests for repairs,    et cetera   . \n\n  I hope this situation is only temporary; it is much more\n\nconvenient ( and usually more secure) to drop off the rent to someone who\n\nlives in the same building, instead of mailing it days in advance and hoping\n\nit arrives. \n\n  collected the rent cheque in July, I signed a\n\ncopy of the lease, and was told I would receive my copy shortly.\n Has it been sent?\n As well, there was no formal damage inspection done when I moved in,\n\nwhich doesn\'t usually concern me, but since there seems to be a lessening of\n\ncontact between tenant, caretaker and owner, I am concerned that when I move\n\nout, there will be no formal record of the condition when I moved in, only\n\nthe caretaker\'s word.\n ?\n\n\n\n  The items that I would like noted are:\n - no screens on any of the windows\n - numerous cracks in the windowpanes\n - the half-finished paintstripping of the living room baseboards and\n\nsunroom door\n - the numerous nail and screwholes left by previous tenant\n - the light fixture missing from the living room ceiling ( I have\n\ninstalled my own ceiling fan, which will leave when I do)\n - the marks on the bathtub surrounding walls where a shower door\n\ninstallation was removed\n\n\n  With the exception of the screens ( and even this is not a\n\ncrisis), the list is not a request for repairs, simply a notice of the\n\ncondition of the apartment when I moved in, so that at the end of my tenancy,\n\nI am not held responsible for these items. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n  Night Spirits:

( Design and Manufacturing Option)\n\ndegree.\n From all accounts he was a solid student who, while not always\n\nearning the best marks, consistently impressed with his effort, dedication,\n\nconscientiousness, and sense of responsibility and purpose.\n\n\n  did much to\n\ncontribute to the quality of life of his fellow students.\n As President of the Mechanical Engineering Student Association during\n\nthe 1995-96 academic year, he was responsible for organizing numerous events\n\nand activities which, owing to his organizational and interpersonal skills,\n\ntypically proved to be highly successful.\n These included such endeavours as arranging for students tours in\n\nindustry and organizing the annual Mechanical Engineering dinner for\n\nstudents, faculty, and industry representatives. \n\n  assumed a number of\n\nduties in the Faculty\'s Computer Graphics Laboratory, providing fundamental\n\nsoftware maintenance on that facility\'s workstations as well as instructional\n\nassistance to its student users.\n As conveyed to me recently by his immediate supervisor, he was always\n\npunctual, prompt, cooperative, and well liked by those who came in contact\n\nwith him, and performed very well all the tasks assigned to him. \n\n  and from what\n\nI know about him from others, he has always conducted himself in a very\n\nresponsible, honest, and capable manner.\n Should you require any additional information about him, please do\n\nnot hesitate to contact me.  \n\n\n\n  I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation on behalf of\n\n Tania Di Souza  who has applied for admission to the Diploma in\n\nEducational Technology. \n\n \n\nPropaganda, and Media and Cultural Context  .\n In both courses, she proved to be a diligent, keen, intelligent and\n\ninsightful student.\n She participated well in class discussions and was also a valued team\n\nmember in the major team project undertaken for the course in  Media and\n\nCultural Context  .\n She attended class regularly and submitted her assignments on time.\n\n\n\n  I was especially impressed with her great sense of organization,\n\nher ability to do extensive research and to be able then to analyze it and\n\npresent it in a critical fashion in her term papers and final exams. \n\n  has had the opportunity to work since her\n\ngraduation and I believe that her professional experience will make her\n\nreturn to university even more fruitful, both for herself and her classmates.\n\n\n\n  I have no doubt that she posseses the intelligence, determination\n\nand interest necessary to complete the Diploma Program successfully.\n She is an excellent individual who will be a pleasant and valuable\n\nasset to your program.\n for acceptance without hesitation\n\nand I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have.  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nPatricia Ann Grier  in support of her application to the M.A. in\n\nJournalism ( Public Relations) program at the University of  Anneville\n\n . \n\n  for the past two years and more\n\nspecifically since she was a student in a Seminar in Propaganda which I\n\ntaught in the Fall 1995 semester in  Collegial  \'s Communication\n\nStudies program.\n This program is a leader of its kind in North America, has very high\n\nstandards, and accepts only students with strong academic credentials. \n\n  \'s academic record may be surpassed by\n\nothers, it is nevertheless quite solid.\n In class I found her to be mature, articulate, possessing strong\n\nbackground knowledge and critical skills, enthusiasm and determination.\n All of these attributes are of course essential for performing well\n\nat the graduate level and I cannot think of any limitations, intellectual or\n\nother, that would prevent  Patricia  from being successful in that\n\nsetting. \n\n  In addition to possessing quite pertinent academic background and\n\nthe above described abilities, through her employment  Patricia  has\n\nalready acquired a measure of hands-on experience and knowledge about the\n\nfield of public relations.\n In addition, she has travelled abroad and exposed herself to\n\ndifferent cultures and living contexts - an indication that she is not afraid\n\nof novelty or taking up the challeges of new initiatives.\n I strongly believe these points merit highlighting in the\n\nconsideration of her candidacy for entering this graduate program. \n\n  to you highly and\n\ntrust the Admissions Committee will give her application serious\n\nconsideration.\n Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate\n\nto contact me. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nMaria D\'Rossi  in support of her application to the Master in Business\n\nAdministration program at the University of  Capitale  . \n\n  since Summer 1993 in my capacity as\n\nDean of the Faculty of Engineering and Computer Science, while she was\n\npursuing her studies in Electrical Engineering.\n As she was on the executive of the Engineering and Computer Science\n\nStudent Association ( ECA), we met frequently on issues related to student\n\nlife. \n\n  \'s academic record may be surpassed by\n\nothers, she is mature, articulate, well-organized, and possesses strong\n\ncritical skills ( it is noteworthy that she did her best academic work in\n\nseminars and report writing courses).\n All of these attributes are of course essential for performing well\n\nat the graduate level and I cannot think of any limitations, intellectual or\n\nother, that would prevent her from being successful in that setting. \n\n  Maria\n\n made key contributions not only to the students of the association but\n\nto the Faculty as a whole, being an able ambassador for us with the outside\n\ncommunity.\n For example, she was the principal organizer of the very successful\n\nEngineers of Tomorrow Conference which annually exposes dozens of \n\nSmallville  - area elementary and high-school students to the discipline\n\nof engineering.\n Beyond the strict coordination of the event itself, the latter also\n\ninvolved the preparation of a budget, solicitation of funding sponsorships,\n\nand addressing publicly the participants. \n\n  Comité des\n\nfacultés d\'ingénierie du Québec  ,  Maria\n\n was also active at the provincial interuniversity level, in which\n\ncontext she truly excelled by exhibiting very strong interpersonal and\n\nleadership skills. \n\n  to you highly and\n\ntrust the admissions committee will give her application serious\n\nconsideration.\n Should you require any additional information, please do not\n\nhesitate to contact me.  \n\n \n\n\n \n\nAnneville  for  Mary Gauntlet  , more specifically, AD-221.\n , and\n\nbefore that by  Mary  herself.\n There are in fact two offices, one for her and another which would\n\nserve for meetings of the various committees of the association and also for\n\nstorage of the rather voluminous supplies, prizes, and artifacts, with which\n\nshe is presently attempting to deal.\n This space would also be ideal as it is close to Security,\n\nparticularly in view of the memorabilia with which we are being entrusted.\n\n\n\n  I am suggesting this in view of the extended responsibilities\n\nshe has taken on in regard to the 60th Anniversary celebrations and also for\n\nthe auxiliary projects.\n is in agreement with me on this; he is of course\n\nvery aware of the amount of space required storage for the activities of the\n\n Anneville  Association.\n\n\npeople might be prepared to give her a rather more effective printer than her\n\nvintage model she is currently coaxing along. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n  Thank you for your letter of March 20th regarding alumni\n\nsupport for the Faculty of Arts and Science.\n Certainly, our Association is always conscious of the needs of the\n\nuniversity and its students, and is actively attempting to find new ways in\n\nwhich it can be helpful to the institution.\n Currently, for example, we are engaged in studying the feasibility\n\nof setting up various volunteer-staffed auxiliary services, with a project to\n\nenhance  Collegial  \'s services for disabled students scheduled for\n\nSeptember 1996 start-up. \n\n  University Alumni, I\n\nwould like to invite you to our Annual General Meeting and hope that you\n\nwould be prepared to share your ideas of how best we can serve the\n\nuniversity.\n The meeting will be held in H-762 on May 21st, beginning at 6:00\n\np.m. and followed by a reception at 7:00 p.m. in the Faculty Club Lounge.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'ff560f36-8fd7-495c-9f99-52605a9c4a7a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.744758+00:00', 'english_score': 0.975179135799408, 'non_english_score': 0.02482086420059204}
{'text': "'To articulate the past historically does not mean to\n\nrecognize it  'the way it really was'  ....\n It means to seize hold of a memory as it flashes up at a moment of\n\ndanger.' \n 'Theses on the Philosophy of History'\n\n , VI, 255 \n\n  'We are confined to ways of describing whatever is described.\n Our universe ... consists of these ways rather than of a world or of\n\nworlds.' \n\n\n  Artists are the mnemonists of culture.\n Their work is memory work, both personal and social, both intellectual\n\nand material.\n I want to introduce the complexity of this thematics of memory and the\n\nways in which I will discuss it in the chapters that follow with two\n\narresting images, the Toronto painter Sheila Ayearst's  Three Minutes\n\n ( 1988; Plate 1) and  The Unveiling of the Cornucopia: A Mural\n\nFragment from the Room with the Unknown Function in the Villa dei Misteri of\n\nthe 1984 Miss General Idea Pavilion  by General Idea ( 1982; Plate 2).\n\n\n\n  The left side of Ayearst's diptych reproduces in painstaking\n\ndetail, and with close attention to seventeenth-century techniques of\n\nglazing, Rembrandt's fragmentary  Anatomy Lesson of Dr Joan Deijman \n\nof 1656, now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.\n Appended and yet opposed to this visual, art-historical recollection\n\nare two memorial texts, one inside the other.\n The larger, apparently machine-produced text records with the\n\ntechnical, scientific precision of medical terminology the results of an\n\nautopsy.\n Embedded in a cup-like form within this account is a smaller, much\n\nmore personal and emotional homage to the death of a brain:  'The\n\nbrain did not die at once.\n - an account that, as we will\n\nsee, is not Ayearst's, but from which she derives her title.\n Both texts float on an indistinct surface that is visually\n\nreminiscent of the texture of brain tissue. \n\n  reveals\n\nthe complex layering of Ayearst's memory work.\n She has recalled an image from art's history that graphically\n\ndisplays the scientific dismemberment of a cadaver as well as textual\n\nreferences to two other deaths.\n The brain - the seat of memory, as we commonly think - is pictured in\n\nall three instances.\n 'mentalist'\n\n understanding of memory's location, and indeed our resulting\n\nrelations with the human beings who are defined by it.\n Her version of Rembrandt's painting is not as exact as it might\n\nappear: she has accentuated the exposed and excavated body cavity of the dead\n\nman, making this space as important both optically and thematically as\n\nthe brain displayed by the surgeon.\n She remembers both body and brain - those elements that the Cartesian\n\nscience evoked by Rembrandt literally takes apart - and considers the two\n\nsomatically equal in their ability to remember, to record traces.\n On the right side of her work, one putatively objective medical\n\nappropriation of the brain and its memory similarily vies with the other\n\ntext, a text that is also written by a doctor of our time and yet is\n\ncontained in the  'same'  skull cap held by the assistant in\n\n 'Rembrandt's'  image.\n of the\n\nlarger text.\n Ayearst's mnemonic devices thus tie the two sides of her piece\n\ntogether; visually, textually, and metaphorically, they tether the\n\nseventeenth century's science to that performed in the present while\n\nsimultaneously offering subversive alternatives to both practices. \n\n  The rich intricacies of Ayearst's commentaries on memory, the\n\nbrain, and science are made possible by memory, but not simply her memory.\n She relies on Rembrandt's more traditional reflection on Mantegna's\n\n Dead Christ  ( c. 1480), for example, and of the anatomy lessons he\n\nwitnessed - as well as the  recollections she quotes - and\n\nshe also depends on her  viewer's  memories, which might extend from\n\nrecognitions of art-historical allusions to reminiscences of personal\n\nexperiences of death to the nature of medical experimentation and\n\ndocumentation in our society.\n What Ayearst initiates - but cannot and does not wish to control\n\nstrictly - with her evocative image and texts is thus neither simply personal\n\nnor completely historical.\n\n\ntionship between our everyday notion of memory as individual and history as\n\nsomehow collective and objective, History with a capital H.\n In redefining memory and history in terms of one another, she makes\n\nmaterial what Wittgenstein has called a  'memory-reaction'\n\n ( 343), and this reaction or set of reactions animates both her\n\nrecollections and those of her viewers in the present. \n\n  , the artists of\n\nGeneral Idea invite  'the public to participate in the archaeology of\n\nmemory'  ( 40)  .\n ancient mural complete with all\n\nthe proper art-historical and archaeological signs of its antiquity: faded\n\ncolour, often imprecise details, visible traces of damage, and, above all,\n\nfragmentation.\n The central scene, however, is sufficiently intact to arouse our\n\ncuriosity and to encourage attempts at reconstruction.\n Three anthropomorphic poodles seem to be performing some sort of\n\nmystery rite around a form that the title suggests is a cornucopia.\n\n\nart-historical allusion to the famous Dionysiac mystery cult imaged on the\n\nwalls of the Villa of Mysteries at Pompeii  c  . 50  BC\n\n .\n But this quotation - like Ayearst's - is only the beginning of a\n\nmnemonic reconstitution of meaning.\n accompanying their\n\n1984 retrospective ( itself a  'retrospective'  event that was\n\nprojected in much of their earlier work) the artists of General Idea\n\nilluminate a project that uncovers the role of memory in their art and in\n\npostmodernism generally, a project that  begins  ( not ends, as in\n\nmuch current art-historical identification or appropriation) with our\n\nrecognition of their allusion:   The amorphous world of meanings\n\nand functions has traditionally been articulated through the architectural\n\nact of construction.\n de\n\n struction into the architectural process.\n In their long-term project, the 1984 Miss General Idea Pavilion,\n\nruins are created as quickly as rooms are built.\n Accumulated layers of function and meaning slip in and out of focus,\n\ncreating a shifting constellation of images which is the Pavilion itself. (\n\n67)   \n\n  Traditional archaeology is based on the assumption that a stable\n\npast,  a  History, can be recovered, but General Idea mocks this\n\npossibility and the desire behind it by literalizing the  'shifting'\n\n nature of meaning.\n uncovers is General\n\nIdea's self-created and well-marketed past, a past that here passes for\n\nantiquity by deploying culturally specific signs of history: fragmentation\n\nand damage.\n All the elements in this large mural were indeed pre-constructed\n\nprecisely to allow for their partial destruction, their cultural weathering,\n\nwhich in turn permits them to  signify  pastness in an\n\nart-historical framework even though they are not literally old.\n We see General Idea's signature poodles, their famous ziggurat\n\nforms, the cocktail glass spilling its cultural meanings to the left of the\n\ncentral poodle, and of course the cornucopia itself, which never reveals more\n\nthan the perpetually plentiful process of construction/ destruction through\n\nwhich memory creates meaning.\n This image plays in a very telling way with its supposed antecedent\n\nat Pompeii: are we not encouraged by the transformation of the Roman wall\n\npainting's supposedly Dionysian women into poodles to question the\n\nself-serious assigning of meaning that typifies art history's own\n\nappropriation of this and all other 'past' images?\n The ludic frequently proclaims memory's work, as we will see\n\nthroughout this book. \n\n \n\nThe Unveiling of the Cornucopia  introduce the central dimensions of\n\nmemory that I will explore and through which I will elaborate a theory of\n\npostmodernism in recent Canadian art.\n With the above descriptions in mind, let me specify this promise.\n Both works quote from the history of Western art, and this sort of\n\ncitation is widely held to typify postmodernist practice.\n Against the now-fashionable lament - best articulated by Fredric\n\nJameson - that this purportedly fast and loose play with art's history is\n\nnothing more than an empty pastiche , symptomatic of a contemporary loss of\n\nhistorical awareness, however, I want to argue that, in many more\n\ninstances than those in which Jameson and followers like Terry Eagleton can\n\njustify their claims ( and both authors can be criticized for the\n\nabstractness of their arguments, for their unwillingness to offer examples),\n\nart-historical recollections are in fact integral to a new concern for the\n\nstatus of history and the past in art.\n 'Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism'\n\n ( 1984) - an article that has rightly become a touchstone in\n\ndiscussions of postmodernism Jameson bemoans what he sees as postmodernism's\n\n 'weakening of historicity, both in our relationship to public History\n\nand in the new forms of our private temporality'  ( 58).\n This loss of the public and personal past, he claims, restricts an\n\nindividual's  'capacity actively to extend its pro-tensions and\n\nre-tensions across the temporal manifold'  ( 71) - in other words,\n\nhis or her ability to understand the past and to act in a future extending\n\nfrom it.\n Jameson's ultimate regret, then, is for what he sees as a loss of\n\nsocial and political efficacy based on a loss of history.\n , he has written more recently,\n\nin a tone that many critics of the postmodern have adopted without any\n\nattention to its local applicability,   ' ... that most of the\n\npostmodernisms will betray the extinction of even the protopolitical in their\n\nagreeable ironies and their aesthetic cynicisms, their forced\n\naccommodation to the system'   (  'Postmodernism and\n\nUtopia'  , 13). \n\n  Jameson deploys his arguments about the loss of history in\n\nexactly the three areas in which I focalize memory: art's past ( his claims\n\nabout pastiche), the recollective construction of the subject ( which\n\nfor Jameson has lost its sense of past or future time), and social and\n\npolitical recall ( where Jameson sees only a cynical quietism).\n My counter-claim is that postmodern memory as exemplified by\n\nAyearst, General Idea, and the other artists and pieces in this book can\n\neffectively call into question the existence of the  'Real\n\nHistory'  (  'Cultural Logic'  , 68) on which all of\n\nJameson's arguments covertly depend and for which he is nostalgic in spite of\n\nhimself.\n\n\nis  history in a postmodern culture.\n As we have seen, in these examples it is not possible to envision a\n\nRembrandt painting, seventeenth-century medical practices, or Roman mystery\n\ncults except through the mediating lens of memory.\n This is not to suggest that the past doesn't exist, but rather to\n\nspecify the  mode  of its existence, the nature of its 'reality' .\n ` no statement about the past can be\n\nconfirmed by examining the supposed facts'  ( Lowenthal, 187),\n\nhistory cannot exist apart from its viewers and their specific and\n\never-changing perspectives.\n is\n\nnatural about our memories, that the past ... is an artifice'  (\n\nTerdiman, 19) erected and mediated by the interests of the present.\n If we are tempted to defend Jameson by claiming a physical work of\n\nart - its status as physical object - as an irrefragable piece of history, an\n\narchaeological reminder, we need only think of how  The Unveiling of the\n\nCornucopia  or  Three Minutes  augments the possible meanings\n\nof its art-historical referents, how each work  changes  the nature\n\nof its antecedent.\n Art-historical citation, then, can move beyond the superficial\n\npastiche described by Jameson to a profound, though sometimes simultaneously\n\nplayful, engagement with the notions of pastness and history in general.\n\n\n  in particular counters Jameson's notion\n\nthat  'private temporality'  , in the sense of personal\n\nhistory or the definition through time of what we call a subject or person,\n\nis lost in recent art.\n What we often see is just the opposite, an extension of this sense of\n\nhistory - sometimes ( as in this instance) through a recollection of art, but\n\nalso in other memories of past events - into the realm of the subject.\n Ayearst has brought seventeenth-century experimental science ( in\n\nwhat could be argued to be its masculinist invasiveness) into a contemporary\n\nperspective precisely by linking Rembrandt's image with recent medical texts.\n We are thus asked to contemplate how the subject is construed today,\n\nand specifically how memory, mental and/or corporeal, is part of the\n\ndefinition of the subjecthood.\n\n\nThree Minutes  argues for a more inclusive and compassionate\n\nconstruction of the subject than that imaged by Ayearst's Rembrandt.\n And if we construe the political very inclusively as that realm of (\n\nunequal) power relations among members of society, then Ayearst's memories,\n\nin collaboration with those of her viewers, also act politically.\n Art-historical citation, for example - as I will argue throughout\n\nthis book - is never gender-neutral.\n It is important politically that Aycarst, a woman, cites a male\n\nartist's privileged exposure of the seat of identity in memory and his\n\nmirroring of the intrusions of science.\n Ayearst stands back from this invasion precisely by quoting it, and\n\nshe is thus able to insinuate an implicit critique of these cerebral and\n\narguably masculinist practices by embodying the more compassionate small text\n\nabout the brain's death.", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'f5d476a7-d1a3-4e1d-83a4-0a1af9b5bebc', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.746116+00:00', 'english_score': 0.952587902545929, 'non_english_score': 0.047412097454071045}

Ellis Barker,  National and Non-National Armies: A\n\nStudy in Military Policy  ( London, 1907), p. 1. \n Conversely, non-national armies were composed of citizens who were\n\n " compelled to enlist against their will, either by force or by\n\npoverty,"   116   116 Barker, p. 1. \n " cheerfully\n\naccepted by practically the whole nation"  it created a national\n\narmy.  117   117 Barker, p. 1. \n Like Lord Roberts, Barker dismissed the army of Tsarist Russia as an\n\nexample for the British conscriptionists.  118   118\n\nBarker argued that the Russians had  " a non-National Army of the\n\ncompulsory type,"  Barker, p. 7. \n Unlike the Field Marshal, he squarely placed Germany at the forefront\n\nof countries with  " national armies"  he admired while\n\ndismissing the accomplishments of Britain\'s own voluntary army.  119\n\n 119  119 In fact, Barker went as far as arguing that\n\nBritain\'s voluntary system was responsible for the loss of the American\n\ncolonies and unnecessarily prolonged the war against Napoleon.\n armies\n\nraised by conscription are always morally superior to all others.\n " superior moral\n\nforce"  over the degenerate French whose army had allowed\n\nreplacements or substitutes for those who could afford the 2,400 franc cost.\n\nBarker, pp. 9, 12-13.  \n\n  When searching for foreign examples which presented both a\n\nconstitutional and democratic version of compulsory service, conscriptionists\n\noften gazed towards Switzerland.\n The Swiss system of a compulsory militia preserved personal liberties\n\nwhile simultaneously maintaining industrial productivity.  120 \n\n 120 John E. Caimes,  " Our Defences: A National or a\n\nStanding Army?"  in  Political Essays  ( London, 1873), pp.\n\n199-255. \n Better yet, it required no permanent army; only a well structured\n\nreserves system.  121   121 The Swiss system was somewhat\n\ncomplicated but extremely complete.\n Military education was to start at age eight in the primary schools\n\nwith drill and other elementary exercises.\n Secondary schools would include training in the use of light\n\nfirearms.\n At the age of nineteen, citizens would join the ranks of recruits for\n\nfour to seven weeks and the subsequent year a similar amount of training\n\nwould be required in the corps of his canton.\n From age twenty through forty-four, the trained citizen would serve\n\nin the Elite, the Reserve, and the Landwehr respectively, all of which\n\nrequired an annual exercise of a fortnight or less. Caimes, pp. 237-39.\n\n\n The example of the Swiss system held an especially powerful appeal\n\nimmediately after the Boer War.\n George Shee presented the idea of a compulsory militia in his seminal\n\nbook,  The Briton\'s First Duty  .  122   122 Shee\n\nproposed compulsory service for one year in a militia between ages eighteen\n\nand twenty-three.\n After this initial training, all trained citizens would be divided\n\ninto three sections resembling the Swiss system from ages eighteen to forty,\n\neach section devoting a certain period every year to military training. Shee,\n\n Duty  , pp. 176-77. \n His argument was echoed by such league supporters as George Coulton.\n Coulton saw Switzerland as an excellent example of compulsory service\n\nwithout militarism.\n A Strong Army in a Free State: A Study of\n\nthe Old English and Modern Swiss Militias  , he praised the Swiss system\n\nfor its combination of  " instantly available defensive power and\n\nperfect national freedom."   123   123 G.C.\n\nCoulton,  A Strong Army in a Free State: A Study of the Old English and\n\nModern Swiss Militias  ( London, 1900), p. 49. \n These two qualities allowed the Swiss citizenry to be linked into a\n\nsingle organism through an  " inseparable combination of pride in the\n\ncountry and pride in the army."   124   124\n\nCoulton, p. 33. \n The non-militaristic example of conscription in Switzerland was\n\nrepeated fourteen years later by Coulton in his pamphlet,  True\n\nLiberalism and Compulsory Service  .  125   125\n\nCoulton,  True Liberalism  , pp. 27-28. \n Coulton\'s words were confirmed by Lord Newton, one of the founding\n\nmembers of the National Service League.\n In his memoirs, he recalls leading a British delegation to attend the\n\nSwiss manoeuvers of August 1907.\n He stressed that only the military instructors of the Swiss army were\n\nprofessional soldiers.\n Newton pointed out that the Swiss considered military service as\n\n " temporary soldiers"  to be a privilege and exemption a\n\ndisgrace.\n cheerfully and had\n\n " remarkable"  general intelligence and sobriety.\n Such qualities were also evident in the higher ranks.\n Newton described the businessmen officers of the Swiss militia as\n\n " modest, keen and highly educated." \n In the eyes of Lord Newton and others, Switzerland seemed to be a\n\ndemocratic paradise backed by a strong national militia.\n With this in mind, it is not surprising that British conscriptionists\n\nwere certain to paint idyllic pictures of the Swiss militia system whenever\n\npossible.  126   126 Newton, p. 159; A.G. Rickards,\n\n " Social Reform and National Military Training,"  \n\nNational Review  , Vol. 51, October 1908, No. 308, pp. 273-80.\n\n \n\n  As 1914 approached, the conscriptionists sometimes gazed beyond\n\nSwitzerland to the outer reaches of the empire for inspiration.\n In a speech delivered in Bristol on 13 February 1913, Lord Roberts\n\nreferred to the schemes of universal military training in Australia, New\n\nZealand, and South Africa as proof that British political traditions and\n\nconscription were not mutually exclusive.\n He challenged his listeners to prove that such policies had made any\n\nof these dominions  " bellicose and aggressive." \n Australia held a particular fascination for conscriptionists as its\n\nscheme of military training was imposed by a Labour government.\n This fact seemed sufficient to Lord Roberts to rebut charges that\n\n " civilian armies"  would ever be used to put down strikes.\n\n 127   127 Roberts,  " Speech Delivered at Bristol\n\non February 14, 1913"  in  Campaign Speeches  , p. 9.\n This sentiment was repeated in his speeches at Leeds on April 18,\n\n1913 and at Glasgow on 6 May 1913, pp. 35-36, 46.  \n\n  Some conscriptionists preferred to look to the British past for\n\nprecedents.\n George Coulton, a medieval historian and conscriptionist, was the\n\nleading user of historical examples in support of the movement\'s goals.\n , he\n\npresented the example of medieval England as a military power with\n\nconscription.\n According to Coulton, the fourteenth-century army of Edward III was\n\n " trained by the completest system of compulsory service organized by\n\na first-rate European nation until modern times."   128 \n\n 128 Coulton, p. 8. \n Coulton elaborated his point by arguing that all British citizens\n\nwere liable to serve under this medieval scheme according to their personal\n\nmeans.\n He compared the medieval requirement for compulsory archery as a\n\nholiday sport with the inadequate training in shooting given to regular\n\nsoldiers in the early twentieth century.  129   129\n\nCoulton, p. 9.  \n\n  It is interesting to note that few other conscriptionists reached\n\nback into the mists of British history.\n As previously mentioned, Roberts had harked back to the victories won\n\nby the medieval longbow in his appeal for a national system of rifle clubs in\n\nthe years before becoming president of the National Service League.  130\n\n  130 Roberts,  " Rifle Shooting as a National\n\nPursuit." \n\n\n, p. 95. 130 Roberts, " Rifle Shooting as a National Pursuit." Letter to The\n\nTimes, 10 June 1905 in Speeches, p. 95. \n After becoming president, Roberts pointed out in a speech to the\n\ncitizens of Manchester that the annually suspended Militia Ballot Act\n\ncontained  " far more of the objectionable features of the old\n\nconscription than my proposals do"   131   131\n\nRoberts,  " Speech to the Inhabitants of Manchester, January 30, 1906"\n\n in  Nation in Arms  , p. 117. \n However, for the most part, appeals to history were not the main\n\nthrust of the major part of the  call to arms.\n Few of the conscriptionists could match Coulton\'s historical\n\nknowledge.\n Even Coulton was aware that contemporary comparisons might hold more\n\nweight with his readers.\n , only five\n\npages out of fifty deal with detailed historical comparisons.\n References to contemporary, democratic Switzerland seemed far more\n\nfruitful. \n\n  fit\n\nwith conscription?\n Conscriptionist rhetoric lauding domestic peacefulness and\n\nsupport for democracy starkly contradicts their militarist and antidemocratic\n\nimage.\n Gerald Jordan has noted that the conscriptionists appeared to the\n\nBritish public as  " a group of militaristic drum-thumping Colonel\n\nBlimps - a pose which certainly since the Boer War, had little appeal for the\n\nmajority of Englishmen."   132   132 Gerald\n\nJordan,   " The Politics of Conscription in Britain, 1905-16,"\n\n  unpublished Ph.D. diss., University of California, Irvine,\n\n1974, p.40.  However, not all conscriptionists can be written off\n\nas  " Colonel Blimps." \n It is true that many conscriptionists were unsympathetic to the\n\nleading progressive causes of the Edwardian era ranging from Home Rule, the\n\nPeople\'s Budget, the Parliament Act to Women\'s suffrage.  133 \n\n 133 For Lord Roberts\'s feelings on Ulster and the Parliament Act\n\nsee: R.J.Q. Adams,   " Field Marshal Lord Roberts: Army and Empire"\n\n  in J.A. Thompson and Arthur Mejia, eds.,  Edwardian\n\nConservatism: Five Studies in Adaptation  ( London, 1988), pp.41-76.\n For the position of many conscriptionists on the 1909 People\'s Budget\n\nsee: Gregory Phillips,  The Diehards  .\n Some historians claim close links existed between anti-suffragism and\n\nthe National Service League itself, although this is not a theme that appears\n\nin their actual speeches. See: Brian Harrison,  Separate Spheres: The\n\nOpposition to Women\'s Suffrage in Britain  ( London, 1978), p.76.\n\n\n Nevertheless, this opposition should not obscure their social\n\narguments for compulsory military service.\n Equally important, the National Service League was not a\n\nconspiratorial organization but an open one.\n raison\n\nd\'etre  was to mobilize mass support behind an issue and force\n\nparliament to act upon it.\n It is undeniable that the National Service League was in the words of\n\nAnne Summers  " a large, vigorous and flourishing organization."\n\n  134   134 Summers, p. 133. \n Although it is certainly true that most members of the National\n\nService League, including those who called themselves Liberals, were not\n\nenthusiastic supporters of the policies of the Liberal government between\n\n1906-14, it is untrue that they wished to impose their scheme on the nation\n\nby brute force or intrigue.\n R.J.Q. Adams\'s words on Lord Roberts hold true for most of the\n\nconscriptionists: Roberts   " neither understood nor mastered the\n\nways of political democracy.\n [ But] [ t]o his credit, unlike some conservatives in his and other\n\ntimes, he did not attempt to subvert it."    135 \n\n 135 Adams,  " League and Service,"  p.72.\n\n\n When assessing the opinions of the conscriptionists on democracy\n\none other point should be remembered.\n They clearly focused on different aspects of democracy than their\n\nopponents.\n While Lord Milner made no secret of his contempt for the party\n\nsystem, most conscriptionists believed that a national army would lead to a\n\nfar richer democracy than any political system.  136   136\n\nLord Milner once described himself as  " a free lance, a political\n\nIshmaelite who has found hospitality in the Unionist camp."  Lord\n\nMilner,  " A Political Ishmaelite."  Address at Wolverhamp <l>\n\nton, 17 Dec.1906 in  The Nation and the Empire,  p.153. \n For many conscriptionists the true core of democracy was the creation\n\nof  " a nation in arms"  with members of all classes serving\n\nside by side.\n Both Lord Roberts and G.G. Coulton stressed that such an army would\n\nhave an officer class whose position was owed to merit alone and not class.\n\n 137   137 Lord Roberts took great exception to criticisms\n\nthat the offspring of the upper classes would automatically become officers\n\nwhile their social inferiors would serve as rankers. He called this charge a\n\n " gross and inexcusable misrepresentation"  and claimed that\n\n " merit..., character and talent for war will determine who are to be\n\nofficers and who are to be privates."   " Speech Delivered at\n\nWolverhampton on March 14, 1913"  in  Campaign Speeches  ,\n\npp.20-21; Coulton claimed that the promotion of working class men over their\n\nsocial superiors " would be an admirable object-lesson in the best spirit of\n\ndemocracy," Coulton,  True Liberalism  , P.34. \n Switzerland was evoked to show the benefits of a nation\'s citizenry\n\nserving together regardless of class distinctions in the name of a common\n\ncause.\n This idea helped win the conscriptionists the support of a few\n\ndissident Socialists such as Robert Blatchford, the editor of the \n\nClarion,  Harry Quelch, the editor of the Social Democratic Federation\'s\n\npaper  Justice  and even Henry Mayers Hyndham, the founder of the\n\nSocial Democratic Federation.  138   138 Adams, " League\n\nand Service," p.64 \n conscription truly was a\n\ndemocratizing force. \n\n  That being said, it is equally important to note that such views\n\nwere definitely in the minority.\n A majority of both Socialists and British citizens were sufficiently\n\nopposed to compulsory military service that it remained an impossible dream\n\nfor Britain in peacetime.\n It was not until the midst of the First World War in January 1916\n\nthat the government felt secure enough to introduce legislation to make some\n\nform of limited conscription a reality.\n "\n\npeacefulness"  could only go so far in selling conscription.\n The best popular response came by appealing to public fears over\n\ninvasion.\n When such appeals were made, peacefulness faded far into the\n\nbackground. \n\n\n  The conscription movement was not one for ideological\n\nsophisticates.\n Lord Roberts and his followers tried earnestly to convert British\n\nopinion to the need for conscription but were usually outclassed by their\n\nmore agile opponents.  139   139 In his book,  Ordeal\n\nby Battle  ( London, 1915), F.S. Oliver pointed to the limitation of\n\nRoberts\'s debating skills. He admitted that Roberts\'s highest intellectual\n\nquality was his  " instinct"  and that he was  " a poor\n\narguer."  However, Roberts  " had the gift of stating his\n\nconclusion with admirable lucidity."  Unfortunately, his conclusions\n\nlike the reasons he provided in support of them  " were in the nature\n\nof statements; they were not stages in an argument."  As quoted in\n\nJames, pp.489-90 \n Faced with such difficulties, the temptation existed to appeal to\n\nthe public\'s base fears about invasion.\n The fear of invasion was indisputably the trump card of the\n\nconscription movement.\n Although conscriptionists tried to tie their scheme to notions of\n\nhealth, prosperity, and  " peacefulness,"  their strongest\n\npublic response came from graphically portraying the threat that invasion\n\nrepresented. \n\n  The National Service League supported books like William Le\n\nQueux\'s  Invasion of 1910  ( 1906) and even sponsored their own\n\nplay, B.S. Townroe\'s  A Nation in Arms  ( 1990).  140 \n\n 140 For a discussion of Le Queux see stafford,  "\n\nConspiracy and Xenophobia."  For invasion plays see Hynes,  The\n\nEdwardian Turn of Mind.  For a discussion comparing Townroe\'s play with\n\nits rivals see Matthew Hendley, " The Conscription Movement in Great Britain\n\n1899-1914," unpublished M.A. thesis ( McGill University, 1991), pp.102-4.\n\n\n Invasion could be seen as an immediate threat and compulsory\n\nmilitary training could be presented as simply the most effective form of\n\nhome defence.\n Such straightforward arguments reached their peak between 1908-9 and\n\nretained some force until 1914 though complicated by the presence of a new\n\nvoluntary home defence unit - the Territorial Force. \n\n  Although the conscriptionists relied heavily on invasion\n\nrhetoric, especially in their later years, it is necessary to go beyond this\n\nwell-known side to the movement.\n Conscriptionists had other arguments.\n The important point is that they tried to use them at all.\n It is only by assessing the full scope of arguments of the\n\nconscription movement that its place in Edwardian Britain can be full\n\nappreciated and evaluated.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '10715f66-faef-498c-b9cf-526db80db757', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.747507+00:00', 'english_score': 0.964348316192627, 'non_english_score': 0.03565168380737305}
{'text': ': The\n\nIronies of Ethnicity and Race \n\n \n\n 1   with much interest and not a little trepidation:\n\ninterest, because of my own Italian Canadian ethnic background ( I was a\n\nBortolotti before becoming a Hutcheon); trepidation, because of the manifest\n\nand multiple risks any such discussion entails.\n Some of these have been suggested in an article by Robert Harney that,\n\nin the context of its attack on Canadian multicultural ideals, has to have\n\none of the more intentionally ironic titles around:   \'So Great a\n\nHeritage as Ours: Immigration and the Survival of the Canadian Polity\'\n\n  . \n In this article, Harney makes a distinction in terminology between\n\n \'immigrant\'  and  \'ethnic\'  :   \'to\n\nbe called ethnic in Canada is to be called less, as in  " ethnic\n\nwriter"  , and marginal, as in  " ethnic enclave"  \'\n\n ( p. 68). \n \'multicultural\'\n\n ( p. 79)  .\n were limited, as it\n\nusually is, to non-Anglo or non-French, then the associations have indeed\n\ntraditionally been of  \'less\'  and  \'marginal\' \n\nwithin what was once called the  \'vertical\'  mosaic of\n\nCanadian social hierarchies. \n Yet, just as even the English and French were once immigrants to\n\nCanada, so too are they  \'ethnic\'  , at least insofar as they\n\npossess distinctive cultural customs and languages.\n , think\n\nabout cricket and Yorkshire pudding. \n\n  Theorists of ethnicity have also made the distinction between\n\nethnicity as the lived experience of  \'otherness\'  , and\n\nethnicity as  \'governed, packaged, marketed, and consumed\'  -\n\nin Canada, as multiculturalism. \n While not denying that difference, nor denigrating that experience of\n\nalienation ( which I know my own family has faced), I still find myself\n\nreacting against the seemingly cynical view of Canadian multiculturalism that\n\nthis suggests.\n a distinction to be made between\n\nmulticulturalism as lived and multiculturalism as the rewriting of ethnic\n\nhistory as well as present life from the point of view of the dominant\n\nAnglo/French cultures.\n Multiculturalism maps differences - and legitimizes them through\n\ngovernment support for things like academic literary and historical research\n\nand also the various ethnic festivals and events held across the nation.\n But mapping differences can be a positive as well as a negative\n\nthing; it can be a way both of celebrating those differences ( while still\n\nremaining within Canadian culture) and of resisting assimilation.\n And I think that irony is one of the discursive strategies used by\n\nsuch marginalized or  \'minoritarian\'   artists to signal that resistance - perhaps even that\n\ncelebration.\n \'Canadian\'\n\n ) , Antonino Mazza uses this kind of irony with a certain\n\ndeconstructive, critical power:  Because life for him has been labour and\n\nstruggle, Canadese, remember your father. Don\'t try to reject your mother\n\ntongue, in our cage, it is wrong; do canaries smother their private song? Be\n\npatient, don\'t rage, Canadese, in time we\'ll belong; we\'ll acquire our own\n\nsense of this land; we\'ll record life and death of our million births; we\'ll\n\nhave families, above and below the earth. Canadese, you must never forget\n\nwhat you are .. never! because, when you do, they\'ll remind you.   \n\n  - is\n\nspecifically Italian Canadian, and so my response here is likely different\n\nfrom most  .\n The ethnicity of the implied reader is an issue not often addressed\n\nin studies of ethnic writing, yet the  \'we / they\'  double <l>\n\nness, which the irony of this poem foregrounds, is as much the basis of the\n\npolitics of resistance as the source of the alienation of otherness.\n And doubleness - of identity, of culture, of loyalties, often of\n\nlanguage - is the basis of the experience of immigration in general, for\n\nanyone, anywhere.\n But in Canada it continues to define the experience of those of any\n\n \'different\'  ethnicity and race - different from the English\n\nand French white dominants. \n Smaro Kamboureli writes of her move from Greece to Canada in terms\n\nthat acknowledge this:   \'My immigrant condition affords me the (\n\nperverse?) pleasure of a doubled view.\n My language is the window that looks onto my home and into my\n\nhomelessness.\'   \n ,\n\nhowever perverse ( or ironic), can often yield pain for others.\n Yet, as I suggested in the last chapter, in this age of the\n\npostmodern re-valuing of borders and margins as preferred sites of\n\narticulation of difference, many feel that the margins are indeed where the\n\naction is: that resistance and contestation make for more exciting art than\n\ncentrisms of all kinds ( ethno-, phallo-, hetero-, and so on).\n The fact that, in the day-to-day life of either immigrants or\n\nCanadians of  \'different\'  race or ethnicity, that\n\nmarginalization may not be so valued, or so liberating, does not mean that\n\nirony cannot still be an effective tool for articulating both marginalization\n\nand the challenges to it. \n\n  \'ethnic voice\'\n\n in Canadian writing,  Eli Mandel noted that\n\ndoubleness, even  \'duplicity\'  , was what all immigrants live\n\nand grapple with daily ( p. 265).\n The literature that comes out of this experience itself exists at\n\n \'the interface of two cultures\'  :  \'a form concerned\n\nto define itself, its voice, in the dialectic of self and other and the\n\nduplicities of self-creation, transformation, and identities\'  ( p.\n\n274).\n I have been suggesting that irony is one way of coming to terms with\n\nthis kind of duplicity, for it is the trope that incarnates doubleness, and\n\nit does so in ways that are particularly useful to the  \'other\'\n\n : irony allows  \'the other\'  to address the dominant\n\nculture from within that culture\'s own set of values and modes of\n\nunderstanding, without being co-opted by it and without sacrificing the right\n\nto dissent, contradict, and resist. \n\n  The need to retain this right is especially clear in the work of\n\nthose writers who belong to, in the latest terminology,  \'visible\n\nminorities\'  .\n Perhaps this has a lot to do with the discrimination that they feel,\n\neven within what we like to think of as liberal Canada.\n \'may be\n\nsaid to possess that double vision which comes only with alienation from the\n\ndominant group\'  . \n This is the double vision that is a fruitful breeding ground for\n\nironies, ironies that voice the contradictions that the outsider can see,\n\neven within a seemingly homogeneous culture.\n Mukherjee feels that one of the most important roles of literature by\n\nethnic and racial minorities in Canada can be to make the dominant and\n\ndominating culture self-conscious ( p. 95). \n\n  This too - perhaps intensified - is the role of women writers\n\nwithin these minorities.\n As many feminist scholars have noted, ethnic women are doubly marked\n\nas outsiders: as female and as racially or ethnically  \'other\'\n\n .  The double sense of alienation and\n\npowerlessness that accompanies female  \'otherness\'  has led\n\nwriters to use a variety of subversive tactics, such as  \'the\n\nauthorial strategy of the trickster, purporting to tell one story and project\n\none persona and actually implying another message, setting out to mediate but\n\nonly pretending to do so.\'  \n In other words, the basic trope underlying their subversion and\n\nresistance, once again, is irony: saying one thing, meaning another.\n Often the politicized challenges of works considered feminist, then,\n\nare also challenges to  \'centred\'  or  \' - centric\'\n\n notions not only of ethnicity and race, but also of class and, in\n\nCanada, of geographic and social region. \n\n  A good example would be the multiple ironies of Lola Lemire\n\nTostevin\'s poem  about her Northern Ontario roots.\n ( Canadian?)\n\nreaders.\n \'the people from my old home town\n\nwouldn\'t be considered / Real People\'  .\n They would not recognize them from their experience of either life or\n\nart:  \'they wouldn\'t just walk off the page / to remind you of a\n\nmother or a neighbor.\' \n The ironies are double-directed here, as readers are told that none\n\nof them  \'would comfortably find a place\'  here.\n The tone of the narration, from here on, is the familiar one of\n\nironic  na&iuml;veté  , of the poet\'s persona as a\n\nchild growing up in this town as a Franco-Ontarian, Catholic girl who is\n\ntrying to understand her social environment.\n\n\napplied to one of the places in town.\n .\n\n\nin the dictionary, where she found all sorts of  \'cat words\' \n\n- except  \'cathouse\'  .\n is\n\nembedded this satiric, ironic thrust:  \'catgut cat hook / I was\n\nstunned to learn that catholic was defined as universe-/ al and broad in\n\nsympathies and interests.\'  \n\n  Métis\n\n , or Acadian one - is  \'other\'  in Canada, in a way\n\nthat a  Québécois  can probably never be, given\n\nQuebec\'s history and institutions, which have increasingly effectively worked\n\nto protect that particular historically francophone part of Canadian\n\nculture.\n Québécois\n\n , English Canadian, or that of almost any ethnic group, one shared\n\nattribute reappears consistently: they are all usually portrayed as\n\npronouncedly patriarchal, and this explains in part why the feminist and\n\nethnic resistances often dovetail.\n As Myrna Kostash has put it, reacting against the notion that there\n\nis no need to attack female oppression ( or ethnic discrimination)\n\nbecause these are obvious concerns of  \'human\'  liberation:\n\n Well, I think that has been exposed by some feminists for the liberal\n\nfantasy it is, and as an ethnic, I feel much the same.\n a Canadian; I think there is an\n\nobligation among the oppressed minorities and oppressed groups in this\n\ncountry to redefine themselves from their own experience, with their own\n\npurpose in mind and not be misled by the liberal fantasies of the dominant\n\nculture.   \n\n  For immigrants, the need to resist that dominant culture - how\n\n<l> ever liberal or well-meaning - may be intensified because of the weight\n\nof cultural tradition, made heavier ( not lighter) by distance and time, by\n\nmemory, by a sense of exile or simple nostalgia.\n Therefore the drive towards self-definition within a new culture may\n\nwell involve separation from this ethnic past, at least temporarily.\n And irony is a useful device for articulating both the pull of that\n\ntradition and the need to contest it.\n It is also a way to challenge ethnic stereotyping.\n Here is Len Gasparini writing to Pier Giorgio di Cicco, a fellow\n\nItalian Canadian poet:  Let us string our mandolins and sing O Sole Mio\n\nevery night. The joy is ours. Strangled by a spaghetti stereotype, an Italian\n\nis supposed to lay bricks. You build poems with the stars.   \n\n \n\nnism has entailed a re-valuing of difference in culture: difference in terms\n\nof gender, race, ethnicity, class, sexual preference.\n\n\n16  \n The postmodern distrust of centres and the hierarchies they imply can\n\nbe seen in many ways: in the recoding of the ( denigrated) notion of\n\nregionalism into the positive concepts of the local and specific; in the\n\nfocusing of attention on the periphery rather than the metropolis; and in the\n\ngeneral interest in diversity, in the different rather than the same.\n Part of this is simply an inversion of pre-existing hierarchies,since\n\nall binaries indeed conceal hierarchies, as Jacques Derrida has taught\n\nus.\n Poststructuralist thought like his has also suggested that all\n\nmeaning is created by differences and is sustained by reference to other\n\nmeaning.\n So, while this equally binary inversion operates as a powerful\n\nchallenge to the established power of centres ( of economic, political,\n\nsocial, and cultural power), the postmodern also tries to go beyond this and\n\nto rethink binary oppositions completely in terms of the multiple, the\n\nplural, and the heterogeneous: " \'and / also\' " thinking\n\nreplaces " \'either / or\' " . \n\n  For literary and cultural studies, the end result of this\n\npostmodern reassessment has been a new cultivation of cultural difference as\n\npositively valued diversity and plurality.\n A good example of this kind of rethinking in the area of ethnicity is\n\nWerner Sollors\'s book  Beyond Ethnicity: Consent and Descent in American\n\nCulture,   which convincingly argues that\n\nethnicity, despite predictions of its demise within industrialized urban\n\nNorth America, has flourished to the point that ethnic identity is con <l>\n\nsidered a  \'sacred asset\'  rather than a  \'heathenish\n\nliability\'  .\n While the experience of many North Americans might still belie such\n\nacademic confidence, there is no doubt that ethnic and racial minorities play\n\na very visible role in postmodern culture today.\n \'exclusion from\n\npolitical power and cultural recognition has enabled them to cultivate a\n\nsophisticated capacity for ambiguity, juxtaposition, and irony - all key\n\nqualities in the postmodern aesthetic\'  . \n One of the reasons for irony\'s key position in postmodernism,\n\nhowever, is that excentricity is what in fact defines the postmodern,\n\nand resistance to a dominant ( from within) is part of that definition.\n Lipsitz points out that, since ethnic and racial minorities can\n\nneither assimilate nor separate completely from the dominant culture, they\n\nare forced into  \'complex and creative cultural negotiations\' \n\nwith and against that dominant force, negotiations that involve confronting\n\nit with their own history and traditions.\n \'bifocality\'\n\n of the ethnic vision the paradigm for  \'the decentered and\n\nfragmented nature of contemporary experience\'  .\n In other words, ethnic ( and presumably racial) minorities are\n\nparadoxically both marginal and typical:   \'Masters of irony in an\n\nironic world, they often understand that their marginality makes them more\n\nappropriate spokespersons for society than mainstream groups unable to fathom\n\nor address the causes of their alienation.\'  \n Perhaps.\n But this kind of logic denies the specific kind of doubleness of the\n\nethnic vision; it risks ignoring the  doubled  alienation that\n\nparticular vision may represent in an already alienated and alienating\n\nworld.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b8dc20eb-454b-414c-8695-f4e43cd5bf21', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.749740+00:00', 'english_score': 0.962580144405365, 'non_english_score': 0.03741985559463501}

W. Bengough\'s Single-minded \n\nGrip  .\n in May 1878,\n\n  " Whatever sins of omission or commission may be fairly laid to\n\nthe charge of our age and generation, indifference to the momentous\n\nproblems of human life and destiny is not one of them ....\n Men are far too seriously-minded in their search after truth...to\n\ntreat the solemn questions which persistently obtrude themselves for solution\n\non every age, with levity, scorn or a flippant superficiality."  \n\n\n\n  In creating this edifying spectacle, the influence of the Scots\n\nPresbyterians, those relentless educators of themselves and others, can <l>\n\nnot be overstated.\n With the merger of its sects in 1875, the Presbyterian church was\n\nuntil 1925 the largest Protestant denomination.\n Many if not most of the printers, publishers and editors were Scots\n\nand had all the characteristics of that enterprising, argumentative race.\n As Elizabeth Waterston has pointed out, Scotland created a battalion\n\nof literary exemplars: Robert Burns for lyric poets, Sir Walter Scott for\n\nhistorical romancers, Macaulay and Carlyle for the writers of  " Great\n\nMan"  and thesis history, Robert Louis Stevenson for those who wrote\n\nadventure stories for children, J. M. Barrie for those, like Ralph Connor and\n\nL. M. Montgomery, who limned regional idylls. \n\n  Literary taste tended to be conservative.\n " the\n\nintellectual vivisection methods"  of Henry James and W. D. Howells\n\nand  " the loathsome realism and putridity"  of Emile Zola and\n\nAnatole France.\n Literary History of Canada\n\n , in poetry the Canadian critic and writer disliked  " technical\n\nexperimentation, the intellectual, any suggestion of the commonplace and\n\nthe realistic." \n " were elegance of diction, nobility of\n\nsentiment, and clarity and picturesqueness of observation."  \n\n  Despite the bows made to poetry and fiction, what the editors\n\ntook most seriously was intellectual debate.\n The great issues - the conflicting claims of science and\n\nreligion, the overriding question of whether Canada would meld, even merge\n\nwith the United States - were endlessly debated.\n In retrospect, free traders and protectionists, annexationists\n\nand imperialists all seem utopians.\n The free traders and annexationists imagined that a north-south flow\n\nwould produce nothing but prosperity.\n The imperialists supposed not just that their country would have\n\na magnificent future, but that it would become a partner or even leader in an\n\never more glorious British Empire. \n\n  One debate was about how magazines themselves would take form.\n The imperialist ( and future knight) J. G. Bourinot, for many years\n\nthe clerk of the House of Commons and a frequent contributor to periodi <l>\n\ncals, wrote that   No doubt there is room in the Dominion for a\n\nmagazine combining the features of  \'Blackwood,\'  the\n\n \'Contemporary\'  and the  \'Quarterly Review\'  ;\n\nthat is to say, poetry, fiction, criticism, reviews of topics of the\n\nday, and in fact, original literary effort of the higher order, which,\n\nthough mostly ephemeral in its character, must have much influence for the\n\ntime being on the culture and the education of the public mind ... if such a\n\nventure is to succeed hereafter it must have behind it sufficient capital to\n\nengage the assistance of the best Canadian writers, who now send their work\n\nto American and British periodicals.\n Such a magazine must be carefully edited, and not made the\n\ndumping-ground for the crude efforts of literary dabblers or for romantic\n\ngush and twaddle ....   \n\n  That Bourinot, an expert on constitutional history, could comment\n\nauthoritatively on literary matters was typical.\n .\n They were not narrow specialists, but took the world\'s mind and\n\nactions for their domain.\n belles\n\nlettres   , but anything in which verbal analysis and narrative\n\nheld sway.\n Limited as their aesthetic conceptions may have been, they did\n\nsee humanity as a whole, and the best magazines they founded and wrote for\n\nhad the same consonance and comprehensiveness. \n\n\n  If the magazines prior to Confederation were usually short-lived,\n\nat least there were a lot of them.\n Solemnly conceived, desperately hopeful, they were pioneering and\n\nthey knew it.\n The age of advertising had yet to arrive, and they relied on\n\npitifully few subscribers.\n To a modern reader it is a confusing world of innumerable titular\n\nchanges and contributors who were anonymous, pseudonymous or hidden\n\nbehind initials.\n Colonial, these magazines heavily reprinted material from Britain and\n\nthe United States, at the same time as they were tracing the faint outlines\n\nof a new culture. \n\n  Magazines in what is now Canada were not spontaneously generated\n\nby Confederation.\n If Confederation marked the birth of a big nation it also tolled the\n\ndeath of little ones.\n The eastern British North American colonies were, after all,\n\nembryonic independent nations, and ones whose periodicals aspired to serve\n\nself-contained publics. \n\n  The first magazine to appear in British North America was\n\nHalifax\'s  Nova Scotia Magazine and Comprehensive Review of Literature,\n\nPolitics and News  ( 1789-92).\n It reached 200 subscribers - including judges, surgeons and the\n\nBishop of Nova Scotia - and was printed on a wooden screw press by John Howe,\n\nfather of the famous Joseph, who also sold it over the counter of his office\n\n( eighteenth- and nineteenth-century bookshops were often run in conjunction\n\nwith a press and journal).\n Edited by the Reverend William Cochran, the magazine had some local\n\ncontent, though much of it was reprints.\n\n\nNova Scotia and New Brunswick or Historical, Literary, Theological and\n\nMiscellaneous Repository; Acadian Magazine and Literary Mirror; New Brunswick\n\nReligious and Literary Journal; The Pearl; Halifax Monthly Magazine;\n\n and  Nova Scotia New Monthly Magazine  .\n Most had varying titles and were located in Halifax or Saint John.\n\n\n  The most interesting of these, because of the people behind them,\n\nwere  Mayflower, or Ladies Acadian Newspaper  ( 1851-2) and \n\nProvincial, or Halifax Monthly  ( 1852-53).\n Mary Eliza Herbert, the nineteen-year-old daughter of an immigrant\n\nIrish blacking manufacturer, published  The Mayflower  as a\n\nthirty-two-page publication in May 1851, seeking readers in those wishing\n\n " to roam a while in the flowery fields of romance - to hold\n\ncommunion with the Muses." \n As the first female editor of a magazine in British North\n\nAmerica, Herbert narrowly beat out Mary Jane Lawson   née\n\n  Katzmann.\n At twenty-four, Katzmann, the poetical daughter of a German and\n\nhis New England wife, became the  Provincial\'s  editor.\n Aiming for a wider audience - male as well as female - she drew more\n\nfrom regional writers than had Herbert and had higher cultural and social\n\nambitions for her audience. \n\n  In Quebec the first magazine had been started in 1792, the\n\nbilingual  Quebec Magazine  (  Magasin de Québec; ou,\n\nRecueil utile et amusant de Littérature, histoire, politique, etc.,\n\nparticuli&egrave;rement adapté &agrave; l\'usage de l\'Amérique.\n\n \n In its less than two years of life the Quebec City periodical was\n\nedited by Alexander Spark on the press of the Neilson family, prominent in\n\nQuebec printing for the next half-century or more. \n\n  In the Canadas, magazines trailed, doglike, the growth of\n\npopulation, though the potential audience was always small.\n In the 1840s, the market for a Toronto periodical might extend east\n\nto Montreal and south to New York State, but was mainly confined to the\n\nprovince\'s half-million widely dispersed inhabitants.\n The later distinctions among farm, church and literary magazines were\n\nsmudged.\n Agricultural papers were the first family magazines, and the\n\nAnglican, Presbyterian and Methodist church journals often had literary\n\ncontent.\n Still, there were certain fast divisions between country and town.\n Those who aspired to gentility might turn to magazines with titles\n\nlike the  Canadian Gem and Family Visitor  ; the more\n\npractical-minded might opt for the  Canadian Agricultural Journal\n\n ( Montreal, 1848-68). \n\n  Whatever the magazine\'s tack, the power inherent in the press had\n\ncome permanently, if at first precariously, to reside along the Great Lakes\n\nand the southern edge of the Laurentian Shield. \n\n  "\n\nLewis Luke MacCulloh, Esquire"  ) edited the iconoclastic  The\n\nScribbler: A Series of Weekly Essays on Literary, Critical, Satirical, Moral,\n\nand Local Subjects, interspersed with pieses of Poetry  ( 1822-27),\n\nwhich shifted to nearby Rouses Point in Vermont after its first year.\n Canadian Magazine\n\nand Literary Repository  ( 1823-25), which amounted to four volumes of\n\nalmost six hundred pages each, and David Chisholme, a Scot, edited the\n\nquartely  Canadian Review and Literary and Historical Journal  (\n\n1824-26), which published  " The Rising Village"  by Oliver\n\nGoldsmith, grand-nephew of the playwright and novelist who had been Dr.\n\nJohnson\'s friend. \n\n  Christian\n\nExaminer  ( 1819-20), the first illustrated periodical was the \n\nCanadian Literary Magazine  ( 1833).\n Published by George Gurnett in York ( Toronto), each issue had an\n\nengraved portrait,  " the first we believe,"  said the editor,\n\n " ... ever engraved in Upper Canada - engraved too on Canadian stone,\n\nand from thence, by means of a Canadian press, transferred to Canadian\n\npaper."  \n\n  Counting both Canadas, before 1850 there were magazines in\n\nMontreal, York, Kingston, Brockville, Cobourg and Hamilton.\n literary\n\nGarland  ( 1835-51) in Montreal, published by John Lovell and edited by\n\nhis brother-in-law John Gibson.\n\n\nGarland  : John Richardson, Charles Sangster, Rosanna Leprohon, Anna\n\nJameson, Catherine Parr Traill and her sister, Susanna Moodie.\n The Belleville wife of the former Endlish officer and ne\'er-do-well\n\nfarmer Dunbar Moodie, Susanna even edited a magazine herself, rather\n\npathetically entitled  Victoria Magazine: A Cheap Periodical for the\n\nCanadian People  ( 1847-48), and contributed serialized excerpts from\n\nnovels, poems, even a song to the  Garland  ( the first magazine to\n\nregularly publish musical scores).\n In its second year, it began to publish lithographs of\n\nlandscapes, children and well-dressed citizens, with tissue-paper overlays to\n\npreserve the pictures for framing, though these expensive trappings were\n\ndropped in 1849 for reasons of economy.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'dac48a83-d79a-4e61-9313-7d947a47bdf6', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.751251+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9710673689842224, 'non_english_score': 0.028932631015777588}
{'text': "It is well known that mercantilist France did not permit the\n\nsetting up of printing presses in its colony, New France, insisting that all\n\npublications of whatever kind be published in Paris.\n Nevertheless much writing in a variety of genres was inspired by\n\ncontacts with Canada and its aboriginal inhabitants, and some of these were\n\nprinted soon after completion, while others had to wait for years or even\n\ndecades.\n Among the writings of New France were accounts of their voyages by\n\nJacques Cartier and Samuel de Champlain, those of explorers Jolliet and\n\nd'Iberville, the annual Jesuit  reports to their\n\nsuperiors in the mother country issued under the name  Relations  (\n\n1632-1672), detailed ethnographic descriptions of Amerindian life by\n\nSagard and more fanciful ones by LaHontan, the massive correspondence of\n\nMarie de l'Incarnation and that of &Eacute;lisabeth Bégon, the annals\n\nof the  H&ocircumflex;tel-Dieu de Montréal  by Marie\n\nMorin, Pierre Boucher's inventory of the colony's resources, and\n\nhistorical accounts by Lescarbot, Dollier de Casson, and Charlevoix.\n Cartier's texts are believed to have influenced the subsequent\n\nliterary production of Rabelais and Montaigne. \n\n  No novels emerged during the French regime.\n This genre had its beginnings in France as early as the sixteenth\n\ncentury, yet it would be some three hundred years before it made its\n\nappearance in French Canada.\n fiction, the Catholic clergy, whose power\n\nactually increased following the British Conquest,  *  \n\n*From the beginning of British rule, the francophones already began to\n\ndifferentiate themselves from the new rulers by referring to that event as\n\n  la Cession   ( the ceding, or surrender).\n\n lost no time in denouncing such  'dangerous' \n\nbooks.\n As early as 1771, for example, Mgr Briand, Bishop of Quebec, urged\n\nhis parishioners to  'stop reading those impious works that are\n\nspreading through the diocese.' \n In the 1840s, Bishop Bourget of Montreal led a campaign against\n\n 'the reading of immoral novels'  , and in Chauveau's \n\nCharles Guérin  ( 1853) there is a reference to an \n\nauto-da-fé  that nearly destroyed the entire library of M.\n\nGuérin senior, and may have been based on fact.\n In the postscript to another novel, published in serial form in 1846,\n\nPatrice Lacombe's   La Terre paternelle   , we read:\n\n  'Let's leave their blood-soaked novels to the old countries\n\nspoiled by civilization, and paint the child of the land the way he really is ...'\n\n \n When Quebec novelists did begin to publish in the nineteenth century,\n\nthey would write a preface denouncing their very genre, or disclaim their\n\nwork's fictional nature.\n (\n\n1862, 1864):  'This is not a novel ...'  , and a critic\n\nclaimed that this influential work was a  'faithful sketch of ... a\n\nyoung Canadian pioneer ...'  Jules-Paul Tardivel, in his futuristic\n\n  Pour la patrie   ( 1895)/  For My Country \n\n, prefaced the book by noting that  'the modern novel, and especially\n\nthe French novel ... seems to be an arm forged by Satan to destroy the human\n\nrace.' \n Réjean Beaudoin has said that the call in 1861 by the leading\n\nliterary ideologue,  abbé  Henri-Raymond Casgrain, for\n\nwriters to draw on legends as major sources for literary creativity was a\n\ntactic for turning authors away from writing novels:   'One of the\n\nessential functions of the legend seems to have been to build a dike against\n\nthe popularity of the modern novel ... French-Canadian writers were urged to\n\nemulate the simplicity and purity of folk imagery, that direct reflection of\n\nthe beauty of traditional folkways.'  \n In 1866 Casgrain traced the main lines of a national and religious\n\nliterature, which, he said, would be   'chaste and pure like the\n\nvirginal mantle of our long winters ...\n It will have none of the masks of modern realism, that manifestation\n\nof impious and materialist thought.'   \n\n  These factors explain the slow emergence of the novel form in\n\nQuebec, as well as the fact that the first novelist, the\n\ntwenty-three-year-old  Philippe Aubert de Gaspé  \n\n fils   ( 1814-41), and his more famous father - who, it\n\nis believed, authored parts of his son's novel,   L'Influence d'un\n\nlivre   ( 1837), as well as his own classic,   Les\n\nAnciens Canadiens   ( 1863) - both made ample use of legends in\n\nthese two works.\n In fact, in both the central plot is interrupted by the insertion of\n\nlegends and songs drawn from folk traditions.\n André Senécal has rightly stressed that from a generic\n\npoint of view   L'Influence d'un livre   is nothing\n\nmore than the outline of a novel. \n\n  Three narrative elements intertwine in this primitive text: the\n\nstory of the search of an impoverished alchemist, Charles Amand, for the\n\nphilosopher's stone that will make him rich, inspired by the manual of Albert\n\nle Petit; the murder of the peddler Guillemette by the hideous Lepage; and\n\nthe romance between Eug&egrave;ne Saint-Céran and Amand's daughter,\n\nAmélie, which ends happily when the former graduates as a doctor and\n\nis able to bribe the previously obstinate father to consent to the marriage.\n The murder, and the story of Amand's search for the elusive formula\n\nfor gold, were both based on real people and events in the\n\nSaint-Jean-Port-Joli region south-east of Quebec City. \n\n  According to André Senécal, this Gothic work\n\nachieves some unity  'at the level of its moral discourse'  .\n He sees de Gaspé, the son of a penurious aristocrat,\n\nreflecting the unease of his social stratum before the growing materialism of\n\nan emergent capitalism, but not without ambiguity.\n Thus, for Senécal, what ties this loose work together is the\n\nthirst for gold.\n Indeed, in addition to Amand, who dreams of gilded treasure, there is\n\nLepage, who kills for a pittance, and the central figure of a folk legend,\n\nRose Latulipe, who, enticed by luxury, abandons her fiancé for an\n\nelegant gentleman ( the devil in disguise).\n\n\nalter ego  , women, those  'merchants of emotions'  ,\n\nlearn to flaunt their charms  'before those who have gold ... even if\n\nthey are degenerates'  .\n Yet, having made money himself while seemingly condemning an\n\nacquisitive society, he says of his future father-in-law:   'He\n\nmust be as poor as a churchmouse.\n\n\n , thus preparing the  'purchase'  of his betrothed. \n\n  L'Influence d'un livre\n\n  that most Quebec readers would know was that of the  'edited'\n\n second edition of 1864, which was revised by Casgrain and reprinted\n\nseveral times subsequently, with the good  abbé  ,\n\nholder of the copyright, making a tidy sum, especially from the school market\n\nfor which he was responsible.\n The 1968 edition, the first since 1885, is a facsimile copy of\n\nCasgrain's expurgated text, in which the rather mild erotic references and\n\nthe host of quotes of authors who, since the original edition, had incurred\n\nthe wrath of the Church, were unceremoniously removed.\n The title was also changed to give less weight to the alchemist's\n\nmanual, and now became   Le Chercheur de trésors ou\n\nL'Influence d'un livre   .\n ( André Senécal's edition of 1984 is the first to\n\nreproduce the original text and title.) \n\n  The imitative Gothic form represented the first phase of the\n\nemergence of the novel genre in French Canada.\n roman de la\n\nfidélité   , which would be dominant for about a\n\nhundred years.\n This principal mode imposed on writers the task of inspiring readers\n\nto safeguard the French language, and the customs, traditions, and faith of\n\nthe French-Canadian nationality in accordance with the ideological drive for\n\nsurvival (   survivance   ) .\n\n\n- the novel of the land.\n The other branch, the historical novel, would appear later in the\n\nnineteenth century and also have a long life.\n Its main thrust, as we shall see, was to turn its gaze backwards to\n\nthe  'glories'  of the French regime. \n\n  was inaugurated\n\nby   La Terre paternelle   ( 1846), a short novel by\n\n Patrice Lacombe  ( 1807-63), which preached the superior values\n\nof the agricultural vocation over life in the cities and in the lumber camps\n\nor in the fur trade.\n deeds his land to his eldest\n\nson, who mismanages it; he then takes it back, rents it to Anglos, fails in\n\nbusiness, loses his farm and is forced to lead a poverty-stricken existence,\n\nwith his son, in Montreal.\n Salvation comes, however, from a formerly wayward younger son who had\n\nescaped to the   pays  en haut   ( the\n\nfur-trading areas upstream on the Ottawa River) and now returns with money\n\nenough to buy back the farm,   la terre paternelle   .\n\n\n\n  Charles Guérin: Roman de\n\nmoeurs canadiennes   ( 1853), by  P.-J.-O. Chauveau\n\n ( 1820-90), an inherited patrimony is in danger of falling into the\n\nhands of the   étrangers   - the  \n\nAnglais   , clearly named in Lacombe's work and referred to in a\n\nveiled way in   Charles Guérin   .\n It is the story of a family, headed by the widow Guérin, that\n\nnearly loses its property in the St Lawrence valley, owing to the schemes of\n\nWagna&euml;r, a Protestant from Guernsey, and his ( Balzacian) corrupt\n\nlawyer.\n Their plot is thwarted by the return of one of the sons, Pierre, from\n\nEurope.\n La Terre paternelle\n\n  ) and creates an agricultural-industrial enterprise to keep\n\nyoung people from emigrating.\n Chauveau and Lacombe were the first novelists to transcribe\n\nphonetically many characteristic traits of  Québécois\n\n popular speech ( unfortunately, regional vocabulary was set off by\n\nitalics) and to introduce genre scenes of typical Quebec rural life that\n\nwould be imitated in the years to come. \n\n  Jean\n\nRivard  ( 1862, 1864) by  Antoine Gérin-Lajoie  (\n\n1824-82), aimed to stop the mass exodus of French Canadians to the industrial\n\ntowns of New England by urging settlement in as yet uninhabited regions of\n\nQuebec.\n Similarly to its predecessors but on a much larger scale, this epic\n\n 'novel'  projected the establishment of networks of\n\nagricultural centres with seasonal, farm-related industries as an antidote to\n\nemigration and to the surplus of the so-called liberal professionals -\n\npriests, doctors, lawyers, and notaries.\n Like Lacombe and Chauveau, but with much more emphasis,\n\nGérin-L&aacute;joie counterpoised the rural and urban milieus,\n\npurporting to contrast the decadence of the city, which offered both\n\nsuperficial pleasures and profound misery, with the much simpler and\n\nhealthier  'natural'  environment of the countryside. \n\n  Gérin-Lajoie had already established a considerable\n\nreputation as the author of the song  '  Un Canadien errant\n\n '  , about the exiled  Patriotes  of 1837, and of\n\nthe historical play   Le Jeune Latour   , when his\n\ntreatise-like  Jean Rivard  appeared in serial form for the first\n\ntime ( with its statistics, quotes from government reports, and copious\n\neconomic, ethnographic, and linguistic notes).\n This, his one and only work of fiction - whose two volumes are\n\nsubtitled   Le Défricheur   ( The Pioneer),\n\nand   L'&Eacute;conomiste   ( The Economist) - would\n\nbecome the most popular novel of the nineteenth century after  \n\nLes Anciens Canadiens   .\n Reprinted sixteen times up to 1958, it even ran in serial form in the\n\nParis daily,   Le Monde   , some fifteen years after\n\nits first publication.\n l' évangile\n\nrustique de la race   '  ( rustic gospel of the race)\n\nbecause of its preaching of the ideology of   agriculturisme\n\n  , the term coined by historian Michel Brunet for the doctrine\n\nof clerical and lay ideologues who mythified and glorified the forced retreat\n\ninto the countryside of French-Canadian society following the Conquest.\n In epic style, using a military vocabulary ( victory, conquest,\n\nsiege, attack), Gérin-Lajoie tells the story of land-clearing in the\n\nEastern Townships and the growth of his hero's  '   petite\n\nrépublique   '  , a nearly perfect utopian\n\nmicro-society. \n\n  The first volume traces the herculean efforts of Jean Rivard and\n\nhis loyal disciple, Pierre Gagnon, to clear the land and establish a foothold\n\nin the former wilderness.\n The second deals with the development of the colony, its growth in\n\npopulation and prosperity and the meteoric rise of the hero from simple\n\npioneer to mayor, justice of the peace, militia major, and a revered member\n\nof the legislature.\n The colony grows into Rivardville, with its own parish and school\n\nboard.\n The city-country dichotomy is articulated through the correspondence\n\nbetween Rivard and his longtime friend Gustave Charmenil, who is obliged to\n\neke out a living as copyist and translator in Montreal, all the while\n\ncommenting on the striking contrasts between his dismal life and the heroic\n\nfeats of Rivard and his followers.\n Jean Rivard and the parish priest, Octave Doucet, whose name combines\n\nechoes of classical grandeur with gentleness,are the pillars of the\n\ncivil society in Rivardville.\n They are often found past midnight in the presbytery discussing\n\ntheology and philosophy, or planning the future of their community in the\n\nmore unlikely location of the  bedroom where the hero's\n\nwife, the perfect Louise, had long been asleep.\n Thus Gérin-Lajoie, a founding member and three-times president\n\nof the radical-liberal-nationalist  Institut canadien de\n\nMontréal  - a sort of people's university that was to fight\n\nclerical hegemony for several decades - forsakes his earlier forward-looking\n\nideas by conforming to the dominant Church-directed vision of the tradi <l>\n\ntional society and succumbs to the strong ideological pressures of his day.", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '13e0acf6-56c4-44ac-8199-5776b7da6312', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.752833+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9553698897361755, 'non_english_score': 0.04463011026382446}
{'text': "1   1 Earlier versions of this paper were presented at the\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, Swarthmore College, William Paterson College of\n\nNew Jersey, and Wake Forest University; I owe thanks to the audiences at\n\nthose places for useful discussions.\n I am grateful to John Carriero, Bob Fogelin, Ed Minar, Sam Scheffler,\n\nBarry Stroud, Mike Williams, and especially Janet Broughton, for helpful\n\ncomments on and criticisms of various ancestral drafts. \n\n\n\n\n  Treatise\n\n I iv 7 ( the conclusion of Book I).\n He is almost bereft of beliefs; he believes, for a short time, only\n\nthat he cannot believe anything else.\n But, being an assiduous student of human nature, Hume makes this\n\nextreme skeptical crisis into material for naturalistic study.\n He carefully reports how extreme skepticism comes about, what it is\n\nlike, and how it passes.  2   2 Here I follow Fogelin, who\n\nargues that the  Treatise  supplies a  'natural history of\n\nphilosophy'  - a narrative of the phenomenological and causal\n\nsequences of philosophical states of mind.\n (\n\nLondon: Routledge & Kegan Paul 1985), Ch. 7.\n 'The Tendency of Hume's\n\nSkepticism,'  in Burnyeat, ed.,  The Skeptical Tradition  (\n\nBerkeley: University of California Press 1983); and in  'Hume's\n\nScepticism,'  in  The Cambridge Companion to Hume  , David\n\nFate Norton, ed. ( Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1993).\n\n  Part of my aim in this paper is to supplement Fogelin by\n\nexploring in detail the natural history in I iv 7.\n Fogelin,\n\nthat extreme skepticism is a problem rather than a tool for Hume, and that\n\nHume is better at developing extreme skepticism than he is at domesticating\n\nit. \n So I iv 7 has two aspects: involved personal experience of a\n\nskeptical crisis, and detached naturalistic reflection on that crisis.\n Interpreting the text correctly requires taking both these aspects\n\nseriously.  3   3 These two aspects of the text are\n\nmatched by two roles for Hume.\n First, he is the subject of philosophical states of mind; second, he\n\nis the author writing about Hume the subject.\n I try to make clear, either by context or more directly, which of\n\nthese roles the word  'Hume'  picks out in different parts of\n\nthis paper.  \n\n  An old interpretive tradition ignores or downplays Hume's\n\ndetached naturalistic reflections in I iv 7, and focuses only on his involved\n\npersonal experience of skepticism.\n Oddly enough, interpretations in this tradition tend to treat Hume's\n\nexperience dismissively and derisively.\n For instance, Thomas Reid notes that Hume philosophizes and is\n\ndriven to skepticism  'only in solitude and retirement,' \n\nwhile in  'society'  he yields  'to the dominion of\n\ncommon sense,'  and remarks:   'Surely if his friends\n\napprehended this, they would have the charity never to leave him alone.'\n\n   4   4 Reid,  Inquiry and Essays  (\n\nIndianapolis: Library of Liberal Arts 1975), 8-9 \n But this joke is an unfair response to Hume.\n True, only solitude enables Hume to reflect, and so to experience\n\nextreme skepticism; but solitude also makes healthy non-skeptical reflection\n\npossible, so that the problem Hume presses on us is how to sustain reflection\n\nwithout inviting skepticism.\n special\n\n malady, as Reid's joke implies; Hume presents himself as a\n\nrepresentative philosopher, engaging in full and free reflection and for that\n\nreason alone menaced by extreme skepticism.\n He then works hard to understand the character of extreme skepticism,\n\nand its entanglements with reflection in general.\n So Reid's premature ridicule of skepticism only threatens our\n\nchance to understand both skepticism and reflection better. \n\n  It is more common these days to take Hume's naturalism seriously,\n\nbut ignore or downplay ( or treat as a mere mask or stratagem) his personal\n\nexperience of skepticism.  5   5 For a paradigm case of\n\nthis sort of interpretation, see Chapter 1 of Strawson,  Skepticism and\n\nNaturalism: Some Varieties  ( New York: Columbia University Press 1985).\n\n\n But this treatment of the text, by focusing only on the fact that\n\nHume the naturalist doesn't consider a permanent state of extreme skepticism\n\nto be a live ( or livable) option, tends toward a telescoped account of\n\nHume's states of mind in I iv 7.\n 'Hume draws\n\nskeptical conclusions, and can't think of any way to refute them.\n Then he immerses himself in everyday life and returns to everyday\n\nbelief, and that's it.'  \n But Hume really offers a far richer account of the skeptic's states\n\nof mind.\n Attending to this rich account of skepticism helps us to appreciate\n\nmore fully both Hume's naturalism, and his naturalism's problems. \n\n  description of his skeptical\n\nexperiences deserves close and balanced attention.\n\n\n\n  Hume begins I iv 7 in a doubly reflective mood: he has examined\n\nhuman cognition at length, is about to turn to other matters, and feels\n\ninclined to reflect on his results and his prospects.\n But from the start his reflections are negative.\n and\n\nthat memory convinces him that his faculties are weak, disordered, and\n\naltogether in a  'wretched condition'  ( 264).  6 \n\n 6 All parenthetical page references in the text are to the\n\nSelby-Bigge/Nidditch edition of the  Treatise  ( Oxford: Oxford\n\nUniversity Press 1978). \n He sees that he cannot expect any support or comfort from other\n\npeople; for his philosophy has placed him in a  'forlorn solitude'\n\n ( 264).\n for as a philosopher\n\nhe sees their  'deformity'  ( 264).\n But no one will leave the crowd to join him in his unenviable\n\nposition.\n - increase\n\nhis assurance and determination.\n ( 265), he has\n\nno confidence in his own reasoning, but instead dreads  'error and\n\nabsurdity.'  All these reflections flow from and reinforce Hume's\n\n 'melancholy'  and  'despair'  ( 264), and \n\npredispose  him to skepticism. \n\n  This epistemological pessimism engulfs Hume suddenly, and fits\n\nbadly with much of Book I.\n Indeed, someone who has read all of Book I except for the Conclusion\n\nmight reasonably put these words in Hume's mouth:  'having refuted\n\nmetaphysical conceptions of the understanding and having sketched a proper\n\nscientific account of that phenomenon, I am eager to extend the science of\n\nhuman nature by examining the passions and morality.'  How, then, are\n\nwe to understand Hume's pessimistic turn?\n Perhaps in this way: in Book I Part iv, he has seen skeptical\n\narguments ( about reason, body, personal identity) triumph again and again.\n Each time he has maintained his optimism about cognition by noting\n\nthat the skeptic's triumph must be ephemeral.\n have been\n\ntransformed; because of his extended study of skepticism triumphant, despair\n\nhas displaced hope, and he is ready to think the worst about human cognition,\n\neven  before  reflecting on particular skeptical arguments.\n Presently, I will suggest that this sort of pessimistic turn about\n\ncognition is not arbitrary; instead, it ( or, at least, its possibility)\n\nbears an internal relation to investigating cognition naturalistically.\n For now, he important point is that Hume's description of extreme\n\nskepticism is itself naturalistic - causal - from the ground up: he sets the\n\nstage for reviewing extreme skeptical arguments by describing the\n\nhistory and the states of mind that render him receptive to those arguments.\n\n\n\n\n  In the second phase of Hume's skeptical progress, he roundly\n\ncondemns the imagination, the human faculty that is crucial if we are to get\n\nand retain many beliefs, and so he plunges into extreme skepticism. \n\n  Hume reaches extreme skeptical conclusions by citing and\n\nreflecting on arguments from Parts iii and iv of  Treatise  Book I.\n But before citing these arguments, he attacks human cognitive\n\nfaculties in general ( not merely, as in the psychological stage-setting I\n\nhave just discussed, his  own  cognitive faculties).\n 'criterion'\n\n of truth ( 265).\n Second, he laments what's left to him ( and to the rest of us),\n\nnamely  'a  strong  propensity to consider objects \n\nstrongly  in that view, under which they appear to me'  ( 265).\n This propensity is the imagination's crucial feature; without\n\nthe propensity we could have only beliefs about the uninterpreted contents of\n\npresent consciousness.  7   7 See  Treatise \n\n:  'the memory, senses, and understanding are, therefore, all of them\n\nfounded on the imagination, or the vivacity of our ideas'  ( 265).\n\n\n 'seemingly ... so trivial,\n\nand so little founded on reason'  ( 265), at the same time that he\n\nemphasizes the crucial role it plays in ordinary belief.  8 \n\n 8 Two readings of  'seemingly'  are possible.\n On one reading, Hume foreshadows a naturalistic refutation of\n\nskepticism even as he gives his skeptical arguments.\n The imagination's tendency to enliven some ideas beyond others only\n\n seems  trivial; rightly understood, the tendency is an original\n\npropensity of human nature, not subject to the skeptic's condemnation.\n 'A Skeptic's Progress: Hume's Preference\n\nfor the First  Enquiry  , '  in Norton, Capaldi, and\n\nRobison, eds.,  McGill Hume Studies  ( San Diego: Austin Hill Press\n\n1979), 233.\n why\n\ndoesn't this naturalistic argument against skepticism ever become explicit in\n\nI iv 7?\n the negative\n\nepistemic assessment of the imagination ( though of course it also emphasizes\n\nthat this negative assessment can have no durable practical effect).\n is in\n\norder.\n On this second reading, that word points to: ( 1) the fact that the\n\njudgment of triviality is provisional, awaits confirmation ( which it\n\nreceives); and ( 2) the discrepancy between the small role we feel such a\n\npropensity  should  play in determining our beliefs, and the large\n\nrole it in fact plays.  \n\n  This attack on the imagination is curious, just as Hume's\n\npessimistic turn at the start of I iv 7 was curious.\n In the rest of Book I, Hume has shown that the imagination is a\n\ncrucial faculty, without which human beings would have few beliefs.\n He could now underscore this positive naturalistic result.\n before\n\n citing any relevant arguments.\n 9\n\n  9 Note that Hume's derogation of the imagination in I iv 7\n\nhas a precedent.\n In I iv 2, on 217, he says that the qualities of imagination that\n\nlead us to believe in continued and distinct existence of objects ( a\n\nnatural, indispensable belief on Hume's account) are  'trivial.'\n\n Still, it seems to me that Hume makes the charge of triviality\n\nabruptly in both contexts.\n And in both contexts Hume might well have said: the imagination\n\nyields indispensable belief x, so is  ipso facto  not\n\ntrivial.  \n\n  The simplest answer is that Hume has in mind the arguments that (\n\nhe believes) force us to think of the imagination as trivial.\n that is the whole answer.\n But I think that there is also at work here an unacknowledged\n\nshift of attitude, a sudden move from thinking of the human constitution as\n\nepistemically enabling to thinking of it as epistemically disabling.\n To elaborate: once we have isolated and described any crucial,\n\ncausally efficacious feature of human cognition, call it X, X will strike us\n\nin two different ways.\n Sometimes we will be glad that we have X, because it makes possible\n\nso many beliefs ( or even so much knowledge).\n At other times, though, all our beliefs will seem threatened just\n\nbecause they rest on X, and X seems incapable of bearing so much weight.\n When X strikes us as thus insufficient or trivial, arguments against\n\nX will come to mind; the shift comes first, the arguments second.\n The shift makes entertaining the arguments possible, and makes them\n\nseem obviously right.\n a\n\npessimistic turn, which carries the seeds of extreme skepticism.  10\n\n  10 To clarify two important points: ( 1)\n I am not arguing that all naturalists are stuck with pessimism and\n\nskepticism, but only that a form of pessimism that makes skepticism\n\npsychologically possible, and perhaps also argumentatively plausible, has a\n\nnon-arbitrary connection to naturalism. ( 2)\n I do not try here to settle the issue how much of Hume's extreme\n\nskepticism flows only from his naturalistic commitments as deformed by\n\nthe  'theory of ideas,'  and how much of it flows from \n\nother  features of his naturalistic commitments.\n that something other than the theory of ideas\n\ndoes some work in driving Hume to skepticism - partly because, of the three\n\nskeptical arguments Hume cites in I iv 7, only that broached in I iv 4 seems\n\nto me to depend irrevocably on the theory of ideas; and partly because Hume\n\nseems inclined to think that any  'anatomizing'  can  'trivialize.'\n\n\n III iii 6, 620-1;\n\nand ( b) Hume's letter of 17 September 1739, to Hutcheson, in Grieg, ed.,\n\n The letters of David Hume  ( Oxford: Oxford University Press 1932),\n\n32-3. \n\n  For a forceful statement of the position that Hume's skepticism\n\ndepends entirely on the thorough deformation of his naturalism by the theory\n\nof ideas, see Martin Bell and Marie McGinn,  'Naturalism and\n\nSkepticism,'   Philosophy   65  ( 1990)\n\n399-418.\n Despite my prima facie disagreement with Bell and McGinn about the\n\nrole of the theory of ideas, I agree with them that Hume's extreme skepticism\n\nis the ruin rather than the helpmate of his naturalism.\n I also find valuable their suggestion that the indispensable first\n\nstep toward skepticism is a certain sort of open-mindedness: namey, the\n\nthought that it is after all  possible  , though unlikely, that\n\nfundamental parts of  'our ordinary outlook'  are subject to a\n\nthoroughly negative theoretical assessment.  \n\n  Mapping this notion of a shift of attitude on to I iv 7 yields\n\nthe following reading: Hume's pessimistic predisposition to think of the\n\nhuman constitution as an epistemic infirmity creates a tendency to lose all\n\nbelief; that tendency is expressed and developed in slightly different forms\n\nin the different skeptical arguments.\n Hume's resistance to these arguments is perfunctory, his progress to\n\nskepticism smooth, because he is antecedently inclined to reach skeptical\n\nconclusions.\n According to this reading, then, Hume takes the crucial step in his\n\nskeptical progress at the margins of the text; so that, if we are to\n\nunderstand and criticize skepticism in a way that does justice to Hume,\n\nwe must ultimately focus not on his detailed skeptical arguments, but on the\n\ncharacter ( and aptness) of his initial pessimistic shift.  11 \n\n 11 I say a bit more on this score in my concluding section; but my\n\naim there is not to spell out an understanding of the pessimistic shift, but\n\nto add some support to the claim that the shift is what we need to\n\nunderstand.  \n\n  However, even if the detailed skeptical arguments Hume cites in I\n\niv 7 play their role only after a pessimistic shift, still their role is\n\nessential: they turn epistemic pessimism into skeptical despair, they \n\ncause  Hume's suspect beliefs to cease to be beliefs.  12 \n\n 12 For an illuminating account of extreme skepticism as the\n\nnatural causal product of reason, see Janet Broughton,  'Hume's\n\nSkepticism about Causal Inferences,'   Pacific Philosophical\n\nQuarterly   64  ( 1983) 3-18. \n So, continuing the task of looking closely at Hume's narrative of his\n\nstates of mind in I iv 7, we need to see what these arguments are and how\n\nthey do their work. \n\n  Hume cites three skeptical arguments in I iv 7.\n He arranges them so that the second argument removes hopes we are\n\nleft with after the first, and the third removes hopes we are left with after\n\nthe second, so that at the end we are deprived of all cognitive hopes. \n\n  The first argument, from I iv 4, says that the imagination is\n\nunreliable because its operation yields a manifest and irremediable\n\ncontradiction.\n The imagination produces causal beliefs, by enlivening certain ideas\n\nbeyond others when certain impressions are present to the mind.\n The imagination also, by following a convoluted and mistake-strewn\n\npath, produces the belief that objects continue to exist even when we do not\n\nperceive them, and exist distinct from our perception of them.\n 'equally\n\nnatural and necessary'  ( 266).\n And so far, so good, Hume suggests - even though the belief in\n\ncontinued and distinct existence has a dubious heritage, must bear the mark\n\nof the bar sinister. \n\n  'in some\n\ncircumstances'  these  'equally natural and necessary'\n\n operations  'are directly contrary.' \n Why?\n Roughly because good causal reasoning tells us not to believe that\n\nsecondary qualities are anything in the objects themselves, but we cannot\n\nconceive of primary qualities being in the objects themselves without\n\nconceiving of secondary qualities being in the objects themselves, so that\n\ngood causal reasoning tells us that we cannot conceive of objects\n\ndistinct from our perceptions.\n That is to say, if we reason causally and carefully, we render the\n\ncontinued and distinct existence of objects inconceivable, and so \n\n a fortiori   incredible; and if we can conceive of\n\nand believe in continued and distinct existence, that can only be because of\n\na failure in causal reasoning.\n The details here are obscure, and the argument might well tangle up\n\nconception and belief in fatally flawed ways.\n But details and flaws aside, the gist of the argument is this: the\n\nimagination, by means of two natural and necessary operations, produces two\n\nnatural and necessary beliefs.\n We can have no grounds for preferring one belief to the other.\n But the beliefs directly contradict each other.\n This problem taints the faculty of the imagination in general, and\n\nso taints all its products ( our beliefs). \n\n  it is sound, Hume has\n\nalredy dealt human cognition a devastating blow; but worse is in store.\n For Hume's second argument destroys the fallback position we\n\nnaturally take up after the first skeptical argument ( or at least the\n\nfallback position he  thinks  we naturally take up).\n\n\nThis contradiction in our reasoning would be more excusable, were it\n\ncompensated by any degree of solidity and satisfaction in the other parts of\n\nour reasoning ....\n\n\n after by the mind of man, than the causes of every    phenomenon   ; nor are we content with knowing the immediate\n\ncauses, but push on our enquiries, till we arrive at the original and\n\nultimate principle.\n not willingly stop before\n\nwe are acquainted with that energy in the cause, by which it operates on its\n\neffect; that tie, which connects them together; and that efficacious quality,\n\non which the tie depends.\n\n\n \n\n  The suggestion is this: if causal reasoning informs us of\n\nnecessary connections, that in some measure compensates or consoles us for\n\nthe skeptical discovery that the imagination produces contradictory beliefs.\n That skeptical discovery undercuts the rational status of our causal\n\nbeliefs; but, if we can discover necessary connections, our causal inquir <l>\n\nies still reach deeply satisfying resultes.  13   13 Hume\n\npresents his skeptical arguments as additive in this way, so that each\n\ndestroys cognitive hopes that the previous one left intact.\n 'necessary\n\nconnections'  wouldn't furnish  any  solace if the faculty\n\nfrom which all beliefs ( including beliefs about necessary connections) flow\n\nwere irremediably unreliable.\n That is, we might think that the argument against the imagination\n\nalready leaves us as badly off as we can be.\n So, Hume's presentation of the skeptical arguments aside, perhaps\n\nthey are really best conceived of as assaults on cognition from different\n\ndirections.  \n\n  Unfortunately, Hume notes, there are no necessary connections be\n\n<l> tween events ( as he has argued in I iii 14).\n of necessity that we experience\n\nwhen passing from a present impression to the idea of its customary\n\nattendant, a feeling that we mistakenly project onto events or  'objects.'", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd3399cbb-77f2-4b13-a67e-051b05c388d4', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.754492+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9427508115768433, 'non_english_score': 0.05724918842315674}

Landscapes by David McMillan and Gary Wilson,"\n\ncirculated nationally through  CMCP  \'s Travelling\n\nExhibitious Programme. \n\n  David McMillan and Gary Wilson have rejected

the value-less\n\nphilosophy represented by the landscapes that came out of the seventies.\n Campbell\'s attitude reflects a malaise that photographers during the\n\n1980s struggled to overcome.\n The photographs of the period seemed detached; photographers searched\n\nfor a means to reintroduce the personal and emotional, to make visible their\n\nengagement with the land. \n\n \n\nphers in Canada whose landscapes span the last two decades.\n The uncanny similarity of their recent work and the subtle yet\n\nremarkable changes that the portfolios exhibit from previous work reflect a\n\ndesire to openly explore and more critically reveal our relationship with the\n\nland. \n\n  When he began making photographs in the mid-1970s, David McMillan\n\nbrought to the medium his background in the visual arts.\n He had studied painting at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and\n\ngraduated with a degree in Fine Arts before joining the faculty of the\n\nManitoba School of Art in 1973.\n For his first black and white photographs, McMillan created\n\nstill lifes using objects of different shapes and sizes found around the home\n\nand yard.\n He was interested in seeing how the composition translated to\n\nthe two dimensions of the photograph.\n He pursued the formal investigation of space further in a later,\n\nsimilarly composed, series of photographs.\n To accompany each nine-inch square enlargement, McMillan produced a\n\nstereo photograph of the same scene.\n The two slightly different perspectives were mounted side by side on\n\na card, sized to fit a stereoscopic viewer.\n The audience could examine the print and compare it, using the stereo\n\n<l> scope, with the illusory three dimensions of the two photographs com <l>\n\nbined.\n\n\ngation by strategically locating the letter D in three places within each\n\nstill life. \n\n  This organization of objects and formal arrangement on the pic\n\n<l> ture plane still predominated when he ventured beyond his home and began\n\ntaking colour photographs of the urban landscape.\n The landscape was not new to him: his paintings had included\n\nphoto-realist outdoor scenes.\n During the mid-seventies, colour photography, particularly that\n\nof the landscape, was beginning to be recognized as an art form.  1 \n\n 1 In 1976, American photographer William Eggleston exhibited his\n\ncolour photographs at the Museum of Modern Art.\n Stephen Shore was another influential American photographer who\n\nreceived recognition for his colour photographs in the mid-1970s.\n For a discussion of colour landscape photography, see Jussim and\n\nLindquist-Cock 97-102. <footnote/>\n McMillan shifted easily from working with black and white film to\n\ncolour, making photographs that turned street scenes into compositions of\n\nform and colour.\n He chose views of street corners, back alleys, parking lots, and gas\n\nstations.\n In one photograph taken in Banff, Alberta, the perspective is centred\n\non a low peaked-roof building.\n Cinder block walls recede from the picture\'s foreground, converging\n\non either side of the small building and shaping a trapezoidal parking\n\nlot.\n Two cars, one orange and one blue, are parked on either side of the\n\nbuilding\'s open door.\n The elements in the photograph balance the composition.\n A white dog by a black dumpster in the left foreground counters the\n\norange car parked on the extreme right.\n The undulating edge of a large pool of rainwater marks off an area of\n\ndry pavement equivalent to the massive form of a mountaintop that shares the\n\nupper third of the photograph with the sky.\n The puddle mirrors the central components, losing some clarity in the\n\nreflection, but gaining in colour saturation, reinforcing the comple <l>\n\nmentary blue and orange. \n\n  1970s landscapes were\n\nnotable for their regional distinctiveness.\n A native of the Maritimes, born in Fredericton in 1951, Wilson began\n\ndocumenting extensively the countryside in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in\n\n1977.\n As a historical base for his exploration, he studied the work of\n\nnineteenth-century photographers who had been active in the Maritimes.\n He concentrated particularly on the photographs of Isaac Erb, a\n\nturn of the century commercial photographer from Saint John.\n Wilson admired the clarity and consistency of his topographical views\n\n( Craig).\n " Views\n\nof Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,"  Gary Wilson described his\n\nphotographs as documentary:   " This work is an inventory of facts.\n Individual photographs contain an accumulation of details which\n\ncombine to describe a specific landscape.\n This exhibition is an accumulation of landscapes which combine\n\nto describe a specific region."  \n Yet the cumulative message of the photographs is their manifestation\n\nof the political will of a person concerned about the environment.\n Increasingly, Wilson\'s documentation focused on change in the\n\nlandscape and places marked by evidence of industrial incursion.\n His subjects included gravel quarries, gypsum mines, soil erosion,\n\ndrainage ditches and a frozen food processing plant.\n Typical among them was a photograph of a swath cut through a pine\n\nforest as the beginning of a woods road.\n The earth was so churned up by heavy machinery that deep furrows and\n\nhollows held flood waters.\n In another photograph, Wilson depicted the site of a gravel quarry,\n\nits scale indicated by the size of an unloading dump truck and the stifling\n\natmosphere by the dust cloud surrounding a crusher.\n The detail provided by a camera that produced a six by seven\n\ncentimetre negative and the even, mid-tone greys of Wilson\'s print\n\ncontributed to the image\'s concreteness and the pallor of the scene.\n Elsewhere, changes were less readily apparent, but each landscape was\n\nsomehow scarred, whether by the channels of erosion from a clearcut, the\n\nsmoke trail from a grass fire or the tangle of fences and power lines\n\nscreening the view of a cow pasture. \n\n  The dry, factual representation of the early work was typical of\n\nlandscape photographers working during the 1970s and may have been\n\nsymptomatic of their feelings of alienation.\n Photographers suppressed personal expression in favour of a modernist\n\nattention to form and factual accounts.\n The American photographer Robert Adams was a leader of the 1970s\n\ngenre of New Topographic Landscapes, giving it both verbal and visual\n\nexpression in various publications.  2   2 Books by Robert\n\nAdams include:  The New West: Landscapes Along the Colarado Front Range,\n\nFrom the Missouri West,  and  Beauty in Photography: Essays in\n\nDefense of Traditional Values.  \n The name referred to the similarities with the work of the\n\nnineteenth-century geological survey photographers who documented the opening\n\nof the American frontier.\n\n\nDenver: A Photographic Survey of the Metropolitan Area,  tell of the\n\nattitudes that prevailed at the time:    A new city had emerged\n\n( though one that looked prematurely worn), a city much like other large\n\nurban centres across the Southwest.\n To show it accurately required that I stop sorting things out by the\n\ndegree to which they were picturesque; if beauty were to be discovered in\n\nDenver, it had to be on the basis of a radical faith in inclusion.\n Shopping centres, junky arroyos, and commercial streets not only had\n\nto be more fully acknowledged, but acknowledged amidst the dull, hard grey of\n\npollution. \n\n  I determined moreover, to stay clear of the mountains.\n passion for mountaintop\n\nvistas, and decided instead to adopt the perspective of the first settlers,\n\nthose who saw Colorado from the small rises of the prairie.  \n\n\n\n  Usually made with a large-format camera, new topographic photo\n\n<l> graphs were distinctive for their detail, even-toned prints, banal sub\n\n<l> jects, and concentration on man-made environments. \n\n  , cars,\n\nsigns and fences represented humanity\'s intervention in the landscape.\n Nature was shown in bits and pieces.\n The tip of a mountain projected above garage roofs into a space bound\n\nby a hydro pole and wires.\n Shadows criss-crossed a busy intersection as graphic reminders of the\n\nsun.\n Clouds or a patch of blue sky gave nature a very small part in the\n\nprimarily artificial environment.\n McMillan\'s tightly organized and close-cropped images visually\n\nexaggerated the urban conditions with cluttered scenes layering objects and\n\ncolours. \n\n  Two photographs taken in less built-up environments stand apart\n\nboth in the depiction of nature and in the more traditional spatial view\n\nimposed.\n A very old tree dominates one.\n It has aggregated a variety of plant life, but is itself leafless and\n\npossibly at the end of its years.\n\n\nstruction site.\n The pile of earth heaped up beside a hole creates the impression of a\n\ngravesite, suggesting the impending death of nature. \n\n  In retrospect, these photographs, taken in 1981, anticipate the\n\nshift in McMillan\'s recent work.\n He has moved away from contemporary suburbia, literally stepping back\n\nfrom his subject to provide a fuller view.\n Civilization\'s impact on nature is lessened, giving nature a more\n\nprominent role, whether in fact or by implication.\n Even in photographs of towns or industrial locations, nature\'s\n\nform, colour, and atmosphere set the tone.\n The rolling landscape of West Virginia offers pleasant memories to a\n\ntourist, despite the ugliness and environmental threat of the garbage\n\ndump with which it shares the frame.\n In Chester, West Virginia, mist rising from the river mitigates what\n\nwould otherwise be an industrial scene. \n\n  , Gary\n\nWilson neutralizes the impact of industrialization on the land.\n The overall impression has changed.\n His outlook is broader, his subject less specific.\n Addressing the ambivalence of his documentation, Wilson began to put\n\nhis photographs in context.\n " Rather than a journalistic approach to subject matter,\n\nrequiring an extensive literary form and  \'reductionist\'  con\n\n<l> clusion, the symbolic possibilities of certain photographs could be\n\neffectively  \'placed\'  within a body of work to help in its\n\nreading.\n In this way my concern over abusive land-use, and the fear of quick\n\nsentimental and ahistorical interpretations of man / nature interaction\n\nmight be included with the general optimism of the project"   (\n\nWilson, Letter, November 1985).\n Signs of economic growth still appear in the photograph of a clearcut\n\nbut the enduring strength of the land, symbolized by a lone tree that\n\nsurvives the devastation of the hillside, offers hope and represents the\n\npower of nature hidden in the previous work. \n\n  Along with environmental concerns, nature itself appeared to acti\n\n<l> vate the photographers\'s response during the 1980s.\n In the US, the catastrophic affect of natural disasters, particularly\n\nthe eruption of Mount St Helens, served to awaken photographers to nature\'s\n\nexplosive power.\n Photographs taken by Frank Gohlke and others emerged as a strong\n\ncounterpoint to the overwhelming culture of the new topographic landscapes.\n\n 3   3 Gohlke and photographed the aftermath of a tornado\n\nin Wichita Falls, Texas, in 1979.\n He was joined in his documentation of the aftermath of Mount St\n\nHelens\'s  \n\n  BOTH DAVID MCMILLAN AND GARY WILSON clearly demonstrate\n\ntheir great love of nature.\n In these photographs, nature is not simply acted upon but presents\n\nitself in dramatic ways: in a rainbow, in the dark cloud of an impending\n\nstorm, and in the flood waters caused by an ice jam in the St John River.\n\n\n\n  With nature\'s strength comes evidence of our own vulnerability.\n Ultimately we are surrendered to the land, as both photographers\n\nremind us, one with a view of a pioneer cemetery in Coldstream, New\n\nBrunswick, the other of a historic burial plot in northwestern Mississippi.\n Their recent photographs convey our physically and spiritually\n\ncomplex relationship with the land, and how the symbiosis is embedded in our\n\npsyche.\n Spiritual overtones live in the clarity of light reminiscent of\n\nluminist paintings. \n is\n\nan all-encompassing view, taken from a point above the falls.\n The people fishing at the edge of the river are so small in relation\n\nto the landscape that they become simply details in the scene. \n\n  The depth of attention McMillan gives to certain objects, places\n\nor moments imbues his photographs with metaphysical meaning.\n The elements of a fence post shown from a distorted angle, graffiti,\n\na view veiled by a grove of trees all combine with the transient moment of a\n\nship\'s passing to imply a sense of otherness.\n McMillan releases the photographs from a mainly informative function\n\nand leaves them open to poetic interpretation.\n These photographs are not symbolic in a way that metaphorically\n\nequates human and natural forms or qualities.\n Nor are they analogies for the fundamental structures that govern\n\nall life.\n Instead of having such timeless qualities, the sensitivity of Wilson\n\nand McMillan\'s photographs stems more from references specifically linked to\n\ntime and experience. \n\n  Wilson alludes to time through change, by focusing on elements\n\nold and new.\n Man-made structures come and go in relatively rapid succession.\n A Halifax city block is slated for re-development, a heritage\n\nhome is ravaged by fire.\n The oil rig in Halifax harbour is already a historic monument.\n A giant tree in the centre on one photograph marks time as a\n\nconstant in the changing facade of successive historic views of the street.\n\n\n\n  Elm ( Chapel Street) Woodstock, Carleton\n\nCo, New Brunswick  , could depict a street in any number of towns in\n\nNorth America.\n\n\n\n\n  relevance but it stikes a chord in most viewer.\n Signs relate to the past: the architecture, the ample spacing of the\n\nhouses, the perennity of the elm.\n Given its size, the tree must have been significant in the profile\n\nof the street and possibly of the town, serving as a point of reference\n\nin the history and geography.\n Its importance is emphasized in the photograph by its centrality, by\n\nits grandeur in relation to the other objects and vegetation, and by its near\n\nperfect form silhouetted against the sky.\n As the main element in the photograph, the tree influences the\n\nnostalgic character and is chiefly responsible for the warm fellings aroused\n\nby the picture.\n Closer inspection brings the realization that the tree is dead.\n Ironically, the photograph also contrasts the denuded elm with the\n\nsmaller trees in full leaf.\n The photograph\'s negative aspect, that the tree we are looking\n\nat is probably a victim of Dutch Elm disease, is more difficult for us to\n\ncontemplate.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'P.B. WOOD\n\n  Given the special relationship assiduously cultivated in recent\n\nyears by Britain and the United States, it is hardly surprising that during\n\nthe last decade Margaret Thatcher has done more for American universities\n\nthan anyone since Hitler.\n Having created a thoroughly unhealthy climate within the British\n\nuniversity system and driven many talented academics into lucrative exile in\n\nthe us, Mrs Thatcher can at least now rest content with the thought that the\n\nsuccessful export of scholarly expertise helps to silence potential critics\n\nof her brave new world, to improve Britain\'s ailing balance of trade, and to\n\ntrim public expenditure.\n "\n\nMarket Forces Rule  OK  "  and the educational\n\nhooliganism of Thatcher\'s Tory supporters, there has been a veritable\n\nrenaissance in Britain of the study of the history of universities, which has\n\nenriched and sometimes transformed our knowledge of European academic life\n\nsince the foundation of the first universities in Salerno, Paris,\n\nMontpellier, and Bologna in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. \n\n  Prior to the late 1970s, the golden age of university history in\n\nBritain was unquestionably the nineteenth century.\n only point to the volumes\n\npenned by Hastings Rashdall on the medieval European universities, those by\n\nJ.B. Mulinger on Cambridge, those by Alexander Bower and Sir Alexander\n\nGrant on Edinburgh, or the series of Oxford college histories published\n\nbetween 1898 and 1903 to see that the Victorian era witnessed a remarkable\n\nflowering of British scholarship dedicated to the developmentof institutions\n\nof higher learning throughout western Europe.\n But since then, the field has had a more chequered career.\n For much of this century, a large proportion of the literature\n\nproduced has been either anecdotal or antiquarian in character, and\n\noften published to celebrate institutional milestones.\n\n\nmemorative work has been highly valuable, it would also be true to say that\n\nuntil recently comparatively little historical attention was paid to such\n\ntopics as the prosopography of student bodies and of the professoriate, the\n\nchanges in university curricula, or the frequently unedifying realm of\n\nacademic politics; and it was only in the 1960s that the study of university\n\nhistory took on a more analytical edge.\n Books edited or written by George Davie, Hugh Kearney, Sheldon\n\nRothblatt, Lawrence Stone, and E.G.W. Bill signalled renewed vigour, and the\n\nsubsequent appearance of important studies by Robert Anderson, Davie, and\n\nJohn Gascoigne among others has confirmed the scholarly health of the field.\n As if to consolidate this revival, and mark the emergence of yet\n\nanother academic sub-discipline, the annual  History of Universities\n\n was launched in 1981 by the late Charles Schmitt, following a highly\n\nsuccessful conference on the theme held at the Warburg Institute in London in\n\n1978, and the continued vitality of this journal attests to the flourishing\n\nstate of university history ( as opposed to the universities themselves) in\n\nBritain. \n\n  The\n\nHistory of the University of Oxford  , which covers the period c.\n\n1688-1800, and Laurence Brockliss\'s meticulously crafted  French Higher\n\nEducation in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries  .\n is something of a curate\'s egg, for it\n\nis made up of 32 essays of variable quality covering a wide variety of\n\ntopics.\n Historiographically, the volume is highly traditional in its\n\nfocus, since the bulk of the contributions deal with such themes as religion\n\nand politics in the university, while the study of student life, for\n\nexample, is conspicuous by its absence.\n Nonetheless, a number of the chapters, like those by the late G.V.\n\nBennett on the  " rage of party"  in Oxford in the period\n\n1688-1714, are of a high standard, and it must be said that the University -\n\nsupported project from which the  History  derives reflects a\n\nrefreshing and perhaps even enlightened institutional sense of the value\n\nof university history.\n Brockliss\'s monograph, on the other hand, is more in tune with recent\n\nhistoriographical trends, and hence deals with topics like student life and\n\nthe wider cultural significance of the university curriculum in the \n\nancien régime  .\n As befits a work dealing with France, there are even a number of maps\n\nillustrating the geographical distribution of universities and colleges drawn\n\nin typical  Annales  fashion.\n\n\nsionally lacking in analytical rigour, Brockliss combines close archival\n\nresearch with a broad historical vision, and his book exemplifies the consi\n\n<l> derable virtues of the research on the development of European univer <l>\n\nsities currently being produced by British scholars. \n\n\n  Thanks in part to the memoirs of Edward Gibbon, the dominant\n\nimage of eighteenth-century Oxford is one of professorial negligence and\n\nintellectual torpor.\n Looking back on his brief sojourn at Magdalen College in 1752-53\n\nGibbon condemned the  " narrow, lazy, and oppressive"  spirit\n\nprevalent in the two English universities, and affirmed in a memorable\n\npassage that   " [ t]o the University of Oxford  I \n\nacknowledge no obligation; and she will as cheerfully renounce me for a\n\nson, as I am willing to disclaim her for a mother.\n I spent fourteen months at Magdalen College; they proved ... the\n\nmost idle and unprofitable of my whole life"   ( 29-30).\n Adam Smith, who was a Snell Exhibitioner at Balliol from 1740 until\n\n1746, echoed Gibbon\'s harsh judgment.\n , Smith contended that the system\n\nof class fees common in the Scottish universities encouraged professors to\n\nexert themselves in their teaching, and he contrasted the happy effects of\n\ncompetition in the academic market place with the dismal state of\n\nuniversities in which the professoriate was supported primarily by fixed\n\nsalaries.\n Such a method of payment, Smith argued, promoted idleness, and he\n\nobserved that   " [ i]n the university of Oxford, the greater part\n\nof the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even\n\nthe pretence of teaching"   ( I: 247; compare Reid,  "\n\nStatistical Account"  1: 229-31).\n Oxford also came in for some sharp criticism from another Glasgow\n\nacademic, George Jardine, who lectured on logic at the University from 1774\n\nuntil his death in 1827.\n , Jardine\n\nchallenged the smug self-satisfaction of the apologists for the ancient seats\n\nof learning south of the Tweed, and argued that the tutorial system employed\n\nby the English and Irish universities stifled the intellectual development of\n\nthe young.\n Like Smith, Jardine underlined the beneficial effects of competition\n\nor " emulation," and insisted that  " all the faculties of the\n\nmind are exerted, and powers unused before, are awakened into life and\n\nactivity"  in the atmosphere of the ( Scottish) lecture hall ( 464).\n\n \n\n  The French universities did not fare much better in the eyes of\n\nthe enlightened.\n While residing at La Fleche in 1735, David Hume remarked to an\n\nEnglish correspondent:   " As to a celebrated Professor, I do not\n\nknow, if there is such to be met with at present in any part of France,\n\nespecially for the Sciences, in which generally the French are much    inferior   to our own   \n\nCountrymen   "   ( Mossner 32).\n\n\nthat the French universities illustrated the pernicious effects of\n\necclesiastical and political control over academic appointments ( 2: 247-48).\n Predictably, Voltaire sniped at the universities as well.\n Like Gibbon, he associated them with monkishness and barbarism, and\n\nVoltaire contrasted the professoriate ( as well as the Academicians of his\n\ntime) with  " the true scholars shut up in their studies ...

( 635)   \n\n  on both sides of\n\nthe Channel were, therefore, largely hostile to traditional educational\n\ninstitutions like Oxford or the various French universities, but were their\n\ncriticisms entirely just? \n\n\n  In order to answer this question, I want to juxtapose the\n\nintellectual record of Oxford and the French universities in the eighteenth\n\ncentury as presented in the volumes under review, with that of their\n\ncounterparts in Scotland.\n For the assessments of Oxford and the French schools quoted above con\n\n<l> trast markedly with contemporary perceptions of the Scottish colleges (\n\nand not just those of the Scots themselves).\n Recent work on the cultural milieu of eighteenth-century Scotland has\n\nshown that the universities of North Britain helped nurture the Scottish\n\nEnlightenment, which is hardly surprising in view of the fact that such\n\nleading lights as Joseph Black, William Cullen, Adam Ferguson, John Millar,\n\nThomas Reid, and Adam Smith were all members of the professoriate. \n There is little question that the Scots were, on the whole, quick to\n\nassimilate new currents in the arts and sciences into their courses, and\n\nhence their universities provide us with a standard of academic enlightenment\n\nagainst which the developments in the curriculum in France and in Oxford\n\ncan be compared. \n Brockliss himself draws attention to the need for such a comparative\n\ndimension when discussing the history of the curriculum, and in what follows\n\nI shall engage in mapping the kind of  " curricular topography of the\n\nearly-modern university"  which he calls for ( Brockliss 448). \n\n  Let us consider first the cultivation of classical learning.\n are\n\nsometimes seen as championing the cause of the moderns rather than that of\n\nthe ancients, they in fact generally subscribed to the common view that a\n\nknowledge of the classics was necessary in the republic of letters.\n Gibbon, for example, went up to Oxford hoping to master Greek and\n\nLatin, only to have his hopes shattered by the indifference of his tutors,\n\nwhile D\'Alembert claimed that Latin should be the language of philosophy (\n\nGibbon 30, 34-37; D\'Alembert,  Preliminary Discourse  93).\n Indeed, Peter Gay has argued that during the Enlightenment the\n\n  philosophes   drew a good deal of inspiration\n\nfrom the authors of pagan antiquity ( 2: 31-203).\n Some of Gay\'s claims may be difficult to document, but Brockliss\'s\n\nfindings at least corroborate Gay\'s insistence on the centrality of the\n\nclassics in the   Weltanschauung   of the age,\n\nfor even though the teaching of Greek seems to have declined in France during\n\nthe second half of the eighteenth century, in the   ancien\n\nrégime   students spent a good deal of their six years\n\nat university studying Latin.\n Furthermore, they were expected to become fluent speakers as well as\n\nstylish writers, because Latin continued to be used as the language of\n\nclassroom instruction in virtually all of their courses.\n Similarly, at Oxford the classics formed the core of the formal\n\ncurriculum, though here too Greek became an increasingly marginal subject as\n\nthe century wore on, and the extent to which English displaced Latin in\n\nlectures and tutorials is unclear ( Sutherland and Mitchell 513-33). \n\n\n\n  The classics fared somewhat differently in Scotland, in so far as\n\nthere was a revival of Greek scholarship in the early eighteenth century\n\nwhich was linked to the philosophical and mathematical interests of men such\n\nas Francis Hutcheson and his Glasgow colleague Robert Simson, and the study\n\nof Latin occupied a subsidiary, though nonetheless important, place in the\n\ncurriculum of the Scottish universities. \n Thus students usually studied Latin and Greek most intensively at the\n\nbeginning of their course, and after their second year they switched their\n\nattention primarily to mathematics, and to natural and moral philosophy.\n Moreover, from roughly the 1740s onwards their lectures were largely\n\nin English, though Latin was often used on public occasions ( Reid, \n\nPhilosophical Orations  ) .\n Of greater significance is the fact that the professors responsible\n\nfor instruction in Greek and Latin indulged in philosophical or historical\n\nreflections on the materials they dealt with in their advanced classes, so\n\nthat their students were introduced to topics in political theory or to\n\nconjectural history in the context of their classical studies ( Emerson\n\n69-70).\n Consequently, the classical education received by students at the\n\nScottish universities was closer in character to that given in France, and\n\nwas probably more closely linked to the other branches of learning covered in\n\nthe curriculum than was the case at Oxford.\n Having completed their courses on the languages, literature, and\n\nculture of the ancient world, students in eighteenth-century Scotland\n\nnormally proceeded to the heart of the curriculum, namely the study of moral\n\nand natural philosophy.\n , George Davie contended that\n\nthe distinctive feature of the Scottish university system prior to the\n\nAnglicising reforms of the nineteenth century was the philosophical focus of\n\nundegraduate education.\n Subsquent research has largely confirmed Davie\'s intuitions, and\n\nBrockliss\'s work, along with the relevant essays in the Oxford  History\n\n , serves to underline the contrast between the Scottish experience and\n\nthe patterns of instruction in France and at Oxford.\n In Scotland, the philosophy course typically encompassed what we\n\nwould now call the natural sciences and the sciences of man and socirty, so\n\nthat the arts student would commonly attend ( with minor variations) lectures\n\non mechanics, pneumatics, electricity and magnetism, optics, astronomy, the\n\nphilosophy of mind, logic, rhetoric, ethics, jurisprudence, and politics,\n\nwhich would be supplemented by prelections on mathematics, and in some cases\n\non natural and civil history.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '532f324c-582a-4e23-a2ff-0c355f29cba5', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.758146+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9392505884170532, 'non_english_score': 0.06074941158294678}
{'text': 'cinématographe  , described the device that projected moving\n\npictures as  " an invention without a future." \n Anticipating the debates that would plague this curious phenomenon\n\nthroughout its existence, Lumi&egrave;re saw the historical limits and\n\nconditions that would define his invention.\n What is it for?\n What should it be for?\n Who uses it and why?\n While the numerous histories of the cinema that have been produced\n\nsince 1914 ( only 19 years after the  and Thomas\n\nEdison\'s first demonstrations) have supplied ample lists of titles, names,\n\nand dates, these kind of questions are often quelled by the spurious epithet:\n\nentertainment. \n\n  In the last 10 years, increased interest in film history has been\n\nonly partly due to the recognition of the poverty of existing film histories.\n It is also a response to the ahistoricism of the poststructuralist\n\ncritical theory that dominated cinema studies in the I970s.\n The turn to history on the part of many film scholars is in many\n\ncases an attempt to integrate some of the insights provided by textual\n\ntheory into the lived history of film texts.\n History in this sense refers to the constitution of audiences in\n\nterms of class, gender, and race, conditions of reception and funding, and\n\nextracinematic culture.\n Only through consideration of the consumption of film texts can\n\n " the cinema"  as a social phenomenon be adequately\n\naddressed.\n And yet historians with these ambitions do not carry out statistical\n\nanalyses of box office receipts and attendance figures ( although interesting\n\nwork has been done on the urban geography of nickelodeons).\n For the most part, the practice of such historians remains\n\nnarrative analysis, but rather than identifying the redeeming features\n\nof a given work, their aim is to identify the spectator addressed by the\n\ntexts of a given period and the institutionalization of that address in\n\nfilm genres. \n\n \n\n" high points"  of that national cinema - the films of the Weimar\n\nRepublic ( 1920s) and those of the 1970s - are especially acute studies of\n\nthe engagement of contemporary audiences with the films.\n Joyless Streets: Women and Melodramatic\n\nRepresentation in Weimar Germany  is a much needed antidote to the\n\nprevailing historicization of German Expressionism as a prophecy of the Third\n\nReich and to histories that canonized great-but-anxious artist-heroes\n\neventually exiled to Hollywood.\n Thomas Elsaesser\'s lengthy study of an equally brief moment in German\n\nhistory fills in the background and the spaces among the three directors,\n\nWerner Herzog, R.W. Fassbinder, and Wim Wenders, who made  " New\n\nGerman Cinema"  an international phenomenon.\n In both books, the abyss of the Nazi period and its difficult\n\naftermath, in which film production was little more than propaganda ( during)\n\nand American colonization ( after), underlines the urgency of defining the\n\nGerman spectator outside the overwhelming mystifications of fascism. \n\n  "\n\nhistories"  in a conventional sense, isolate groups of Hollywood\n\nfilms that delineate histories within the larger history of American studio\n\nproduction.\n Rick Altman and Robert Lang manage, with different degrees of\n\nsuccess, to trace out histories of American desires in the contexts of the\n\nHollywood musical and melodrama respectively.\n can be handily dismissed\n\nas  " entertainment,"  it is the responsibility of the\n\nhistorian to find out what entertainment has meant at different times.\n For what desires does it portend to offer satisfaction? And whose\n\ndesires are they? The two studies in question take very different approaches\n\nto genre, but in both cases the differences within genre films and the subtle\n\nvariations on a narrative formula demonstrate shifts in modes of address that\n\ncorrespond to different historical spectators. \n\n  While all four of these histories embrace feminist cultural\n\nanalysis, Petro\'s study of Weimar cinema, as its title suggests, takes the\n\nmost systematically feminist approach.\n Her project is to recover an inscription of female spectatorship from\n\na body of films that has been until now discussed as a cinema produced by men\n\nfor men.\n No one, not even Petro, would argue with Siegfried Kracauer\'s\n\nobservation that the male Weimar protagonists tended to be weak, passive, and\n\nanxiety-ridden.\n Indeed Petro expands on the androgyny and homoeroticism of many of\n\nthese films, but rather than situating the representational and narrative\n\ninstability within the context of modernism, as critics since Kracauer have\n\ndone, she suggests that these films might have provided an inscription of\n\n " emancipation"  for female viewers.\n This is not to argue for any actual relief from patriarchal\n\noppression for the women of Germany in the 1920s, but to point to a place\n\nwhere their desires might have found representation. \n\n  is towards\n\nthe analysis of four key films of the 1920s ( one of them titled  Joyless\n\nStreet  ) , Petro sets up these analyses with an examination of the\n\ngender politics of the period, which of course informed other discourses\n\nbesides the cinema.\n In the cultural theories of Kracauer, Walter Benjamin, and Martin\n\nHeidegger ( three important predecessors of the postwar Frankfurt School),\n\nGerman cities, especially Berlin, were consistently described as female.\n Moreover, as these theorists tackled the transformation of vision and\n\nthe gaze that the industrial metropolis was affecting, the female viewer came\n\nto symbolize a distracted and fragmented mode of perception.\n Women were becoming a highly visible presence in Weimar Germany, not\n\nonly at the movies, but in the workplace and on the street.\n But they also remained at home, fulfilling more traditional\n\nroles.\n " mass\n\nculture"  - a term that acquired currency precisely in the Weimar con\n\n<l> text - and for a culture that included not only women, but many different\n\nkinds of women, whose place within a rapidly changing environment was\n\nnegotiated within a politics of spectatorship. \n\n  In the illustrated press, a genre that boomed between the wars,\n\nimages of women tended to fall into two categories that appeared in both\n\nleft- and right-wing publications.\n The first and perhaps the most familiar icon is that of the New\n\nWoman, the female consumer in highly masculinized attire.\n , these\n\nfashion layouts would have been addressed to a female reader, matching\n\nher new buying power with a loss of sexuality.\n The second representation was that of the proletarian mother,\n\ntypically pregnant and drawn or lithographed in round, dark lines.\n Adhering to melodramatic conventions, these images participated\n\nin a discourse of pathos, which in the leftist press (  \n\nInternationale Arbeiterhilfe   and   Arbetier\n\nIllustrierte Zeitung   ) was rhetorically opposed to the\n\nbourgeois New Woman, situating anti-capitalist and reproductive values on the\n\nsite of the female body.\n " The address to female voters emphasizes class\n\ncontradiction, whereas the address to male voters calls for class\n\nreconciliation"   ( 139), suggesting that, when addressed to\n\nfemale readers, the iconography of gender takes on meanings other than\n\n " male anxiety and fear"  ( 110). \n\n  The address to women was therefore paradoxical; on one hand women\n\nwere the symbols of political and economic  " liberation," \n\nand on the other they represented the suffering of the underclasses.\n\n\n Nosferatu   and  The Cabinet of Dr Caligari  ,\n\nfeminine sexuality lurks behind the hysteria of   mise en\n\nsc&egrave;ne   and violence; the deep anxiety of the male\n\ncharacters is almost always released on the terror of virginal brides.\n Not surprisingly, it is in the figure of the prostitute that these\n\ntwo discourses of modernity and pathos come together, and such figures abound\n\nin the Weimar cinema.\n The main actresses of the period - Marlene Dietrich, Louise Brooks,\n\nAsta Nielson, and Henny Porten - frequently played women who, in the latest\n\nfashions ( often tending toward androgyny), used their bodies in desperate,\n\nand almost always failed, attempts to survive in a cruel, cruel world.\n Petro argues that the visual excess of these silent films ( lighting,\n\nstaging, pacing, and violence that strain the bounds of realism) is born of\n\nthe impossible contradiction between the iconic New Woman and the poor\n\nchances of her social mobility.\n In melodrama, the pathos of women\'s contradictory situation is\n\nrealized in concrete situations. \n\n  If mass culture was characterized as female and if modernism was\n\nthe province of male anxiety, then the politics of representation were indeed\n\nthe politics of gender in Weimar Germany.\n The presence of women at the movies in Weimar and elsewhere in the\n\n1920s was in many respects their entry into official culture.\n films with\n\nfemale protagonists who suffer and usually die, and their public exhibition\n\nprovided the  " conditions of visibility"  for women: they\n\nwere addressed as spectators and desiring subjects.\n Petro might be accused of excluding class and sex-bound male\n\nspectators from the pleasures that she identifies in Weimar cinema, and yet\n\nthe work stands as an exemplary model of historiography.\n She manages to acquire some distance from the evaluative discourses\n\nof modernism and mass culture, but not by moving away from the canons of\n\nGerman Expressionism and   Kammerspiel   ( street\n\nrealism).\n In order to point to textual expressions of frustrated desires for\n\nsocial and sexual emancipation, she attends to the social representations\n\nthat underscore the formal innovations of some very well-known films. \n\n  Joyless\n\nStreets  , it is hard not to have lingering doubts about the audiences\n\nthat she assumes for the films.\n also has this problem.\n Where Petro cites a 1914 dissertation to support her claim that\n\n " a vast number of filmgoers in Germany were women"  in the\n\n1920s ( xx), Elsaesser relies rather heavily on the writing of Michael\n\nRutschky ( particularly an essay called  " Dreaming the Real"  )\n\nfor his characterization of the Bohemian politicos who supposedly frequented\n\nGerman cinemas in the 1970s.\n Neither source is either authoritative or terribly convincing, and\n\nyet it seems to be necessary for both historians that they demonstrate the\n\nempirical existence of those spectators who, they claim, are addressed\n\nby the texts in question.\n One would almost prefer that they stuck to the textual evidence alone\n\nif they were not prepared to offer empirical confirmation of their findings.\n It may not be possible to know with any certainty the make-up of\n\nhistorical audiences in terms of gender, class, or political orientation, but\n\nif film history is going to move away from narratives of great works and to\n\nbe able to account for the cinema in its larger sense, it is essential that\n\naudiences be accounted for by some means. \n\n  The New German Cinema, Elsaesser argues, can only be described as\n\na coherent entity in terms of its address to an historically specific\n\naudience.\n In North America, postwar German film has been represented by only a\n\nhandful of directors and very few films made before 1975.\n And yet it was in 1962 that a group of German filmmakers signed the\n\nOberhausen Manifesto, simultaneously tolling the death of the  " old\n\ncinema"  and instituting a system of federal subsidies for\n\nGerman film that continues to the present day.\n The Young German Film, as Elsaesser calls the work that immediately\n\nfollowed Oberhausen, had a  " false start,"  though.\n Its proponents fell into two distinct sets: those ( e.g., Kluge,\n\nStraub) who challenged the Hollywood norm so radically that they antagonized\n\ntheir potential audience, and those who fell too easily into the Hollywood\n\npattern and used the generous subsidies for poor imitations of the American\n\ncompetition.\n The New German cinema did not come into its own until filmmakers were\n\nable to find a middle ground between the avant-garde and the commercial\n\ncinema and were able to address an emergent group of spectators in the wake\n\nof the late 1960s student movements. \n\n  If Weimar cinema was torn between mass culture and modernism, the\n\nNew German Cinema was characterized by a similar split.\n As a subsidized industry, film was ( officially) designated a\n\ncultural product that might revamp a debilitated national cinema, but from\n\nthe outset this cinema was an  " author\'s cinema"  ( \n\n Autoren   ) , built around the efforts of individual\n\ndirectors.\n The duality of art and popular culture, further institutionalized in\n\nthe crucial role of television in this revamped industry, hinged on the\n\nfigure of the  " visionary"  artist hero who became him or\n\nherself a commodity in the culture industry.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL',

{'text': 'a new resident said to me last winter,   " if only it would\n\nstop worrying whether it\'s a world-class one."   I could see what\n\nshe meant.\n For several seasons now the dominant note of the city\'s theatrical\n\nculture has been anxiety, which notoriously impairs most kinds of\n\nperformance.\n First there was the anxiety whether home-made Canadian produce could\n\nstand up to such spectacular invading juggernauts as   Les\n\nMisérables   and  The Phantom of the Opera  .\n That led to some unfriendly notices of the musicals when they arrived,\n\nwhich in turn uncovered odd, congested knots of paranoia among the\n\nbuilders and boosters who rattled gold chains at each other at  The\n\nPhantom\'s  opening galas.\n To knock the glitziest theatrical offering in the city\'s history, they\n\ncomplained to the editor of  The Globe and Mail  , was treason to\n\nthe city itself, its manifest destiny to become the Dallas of the North.\n Any nay-sayer questioning Toronto\'s right to share long-running Lloyd\n\nWebber musicals with London, New York, and Tokyo should be ridden out of\n\ntown on a rail, while we still have rails. \n\n  Both concerns were answered, in different ways, by the startling\n\nsuccess of George Walker\'s local comedy  Love and Anger  , a\n\nglitzless lampoon of those movers and shakers who would make Toronto, as\n\nsomeone in the play put it, a place satisfying only to baseball fans and real\n\nestate dealers.\n Under the probosces of the singing mastodons, this racked up the\n\nlongest run so far recorded by a straight Canadian play ( its nearest rival,\n\nJohn Krizanc\'s  Tamara  , presumably may be classed as bent) in the\n\ncity\'s annals.\n The\n\nPhantom\'s  local franchisee, to the large auditorium of the St\n\nLawrence Centre for a commercial run.\n But this success, as success does, opened new vistas of anxiety.\n Could Walker\'s modest six-character effort live up to its publicity,\n\nor even cover the cost of the campaign that blazoned it on half the bus\n\nshelters in town?\n It is one thing to sell 300 seats for 30 weeks in the unthreateningly\n\ntacky Factory Theatre, out among the warehouses of the garment district;\n\nanother to sell 900 for 10 weeks in a spiffy, plum-carpeted civic showcase.\n And suppose it did succeed there?\n Might that not be more ominous still?\n Might it not signify the fulfilment of every anti-Free Trade\n\npatriot\'s nightmare: that to meet the challenge of American mass\n\nculture, our Canadian arts might shed their shy, specific charm and learn the\n\nblatant trick of vulgar popularity? \n\n  It might have eased the Toronto theatre\'s anxieties had it paused\n\nto consider that it was already world class in its worries.\n Like London, Paris, and most western capitals, it has suffered the\n\npains of subsidy withdrawal during a decade of Thatcherite retrenchment in\n\npublic expenditure.\n The thriving theatrical culture spread across the country by the\n\nCanada Council\'s first 20 years of nurturing has had its milk ration\n\ncut, as Mrs Thatcher cut that of Britain\'s schoolchildren, and been told to\n\nget out and hustle the private sector for sponsorships, the arts bureaucrat\'s\n\neuphemism for advertising.\n Dismay and confusion were inevitable, as a theatre bred up to pursue\n\nart for the sake of art and national expression tried to learn how to blend\n\nthose aims with the wiles of showbiz and the notions of good taste that\n\nobtain in corporate  PR  departments.\n No wonder the face of Toronto\'s theatre of late has sometimes\n\nrecalled that of the wife in Thurber\'s cartoon, a distressed matron near the\n\nend of her tether, at whom her husband has thrown the sardonic question: \n\n " And how do you propose to live?\n\n\n  Fortunately the Toronto stage has at least one wit to live by.\n George Walker\'s remarkable success holds useful lessons for his\n\nco-workers, both in how to do things right in a mixed theatrical economy and\n\nin how to look out for what may go wrong.\n as popular\n\nentertainment, but a few things may have gone wrong for it as a political\n\nstatement.\n As a play, it is an organic growth of subsidized theatre, its form\n\nand language rooted in the complex of attitudes that make for public support\n\nto the arts.\n Yet somehow a larger commercial audience that rejects most of those\n\nattitudes took the play to its bosom.\n Did it convert them?\n Did they not believe it meant it?\n Or did they just hear it wrong?\n\n\n  On the face of it, the last question should be absurd.\n Walker, who has taken to directing his plays himself, does so on the\n\napparent first principle that everyone should shout as loudly as possible, as\n\nactors used to on old radio comedy shows.\n It would be nice to think that he does this from modesty about\n\nhis skills as a comic writer, a fear that his wit would fall dead unless\n\npackaged in a generalized roar of raucous good humour.\n But the evidence suggests rather that it is part of a systematic\n\ncommitment to populism: a belief that to expect audiences to appreciate\n\nthe acting skill that points a deftly turned witticism, or the skill of the\n\nwriting itself, is to trade in élitism, excluding the audience that\n\nenjoys the Canadian Air Farce.\n As a result, he writes scripts whose affinities are with Wilde,\n\nOrton, and Ronald Firbank and entrusts them to casts whose models are Wayne,\n\nSchuster, Fibber McGee and Molly. \n\n  This systematic populism runs deep into the texture of his\n\nwriting.\n In the first full-length academic study of Walker\'s work, Dr\n\nCatherine Smith demonstrates the parodic use his plays make, apart and\n\ntogether, of two of the most popular genres of the old Hollywood: the \n\n film noir   thriller that walked the mean streets of\n\nAmerica and the crazy family comedies of Frank Capra.\n\n\nBetter Living, Beautiful City  , and  Criminals in Love  ,\n\ndraws on both of them.\n The Toronto that lies beyond Petie Maxwell\'s basement law office is\n\nclearly as violent and corrupt as the Los Angeles of  The Blue Dahlia\n\n or  The Big Sleep  , but the tiny   ad hoc \n\n family he gathers around him to fight it is as amiably demented as\n\nthe Sycamores of Capra\'s  You Can\'t Take It With You.  \n\n  The problem with this is that the two genres build from\n\nincompatible premises.\n In Capra\'s comic world there can be no real villains.\n The benign madness of his crazy families is to believe everyone\n\nbasically good, deep down, when liberated from the rat-race of capitalist\n\ncompetition.\n The happy endings that prove them saner than the societies around\n\nthem win the villains over to love, leisure, and apple pie.\n is the\n\nantithesis of this.\n The secret chivalry of its soiled, disillusioned heroes is to go\n\non pitting themselves, hopelessly and romantically as Don Quixote, against a\n\nworld that every morning brings forth a new crop of evil, endemic and\n\nineradicable, for them to challenge again.\n If there were any real chance of their winning more than compromised\n\nlocal victories that turn sour in the mouth, they wouldn\'t be heroes and the\n\nyoung wouldn\'t collect Humphrey Bogart posters. \n\n \n\nLove and

{'text': 'We humans are profoundly social animals.\n The biological success of our species - our numbers, our worldwide\n\ndistribution - depends in no small measure on our ability to acquire\n\nbehaviour socially: to use and, over generations, to improve upon one\n\nanother\'s responses to environmental challenge.\n Members of our species, however, are not unique in using the behaviour\n\nof others to guide their own responses to life\'s demands.\n Like us, various insects, fishes, birds, and mammals can exploit the\n\nbehaviour of conspecifics to bias their own behavioural development in\n\nadaptive directions. \n\n  We humans are, apparently, exceptional in our spontaneous use of\n\narbitrary signs and symbols to communicate with our fellows.\n We may well be unusual both in intentionally teaching others how to\n\nbehave ( Barnett, 1968; Ewer, 1969; Galef & Dalrymple, 1978) and in the\n\nextent to which we acquire motor skills by observing and then imitating our\n\nmore accomplished fellows ( Davis, 1973; Galef, 1988b; Roberts, 1941; Thorpe,\n\n1963).\n However, it is only recently that evidence supporting even these\n\nrelatively simple statements about differences in the processes supporting\n\nsocial learning by members of our own and other species has become available.\n For many decades, the processes used by animals and by humans to\n\nlearn socially were assumed to be identical. \n\n\n  Late in the first half of the 19th century, Franz Gall, father of\n\nphrenology, quoted with approval the following passage from the works of the\n\nFrench philosopher and naturalist Charles-George Leroy to show that animals (\n\nin this case foxes), like humans, used arbitrary sounds,  " verbal\n\nlanguage"  ( Gall, 1835, p. 26), to communicate ideas and emotions:\n\n \n It is certain from observation, that before having been able\n\nto instruct themselves by personal experience, the young foxes on leaving the\n\nburrow, for the first time, are more distrustful, and more cautious in the\n\nplaces where war is often made on them, than in places where the snares have\n\nnever been spread.\n This observation, which is incontestable, proves absolutely the need\n\nthey have of language; for, without it, how could they acquire the knowledge\n\nof proper precautions, which knowledge supposes a succession of facts known,\n\nof comparisons made, of judgments rendered?\n It appears then, that it is absurd to doubt, that brutes have among\n\nthem a language, by means of which they transmit ideas, the communication of\n\nwhich is necessary to them.  ( Leroy, 1802, in Gall, 1835, p. 29)\n\n\n\n  To the modern reader, Leroy\'s views on the mechanisms of animal\n\nsocial learning and Gall\'s uncritical promotion of them ( assuming, for the\n\nsake of argument, that naive young foxes do, in fact, behave as Leroy\n\nasserted they do) may suggest that both gentlemen were singularly thoughtless\n\nor gullible.\n It is, however, probably more reasonable to assume that the failure\n\nof Gall and of Leroy to provide a convincing explanation of the avoidance by\n\nnaive, young foxes of areas containing snares arose not from thoughtlessness\n\nor gullibility, but from a lack of alternative hypotheses to explain the\n\nbehaviour of foxes. \n\n  For the contemporary reader, aware of the existence of\n\npheromones, in general ( Wilson & Bossert, 1963), and of warning pheromones,\n\nin particular ( von Frisch, 1941), or knowledgeable about the ways in which\n\nEuropean blackbirds ( Curio, Ernst, & Vieth, 1978) or rhesus monkeys ( Cook,\n\nMineka, Wolkenstein, & Laitsch, 1985) come to avoid potential predators,\n\nobservations of social influences on avoidance are not evidence of an ability\n\nof animals to communicate using language.\n However, if, like Gall and Leroy working in the 19th century, we\n\ntoday knew of no means other than language for the transmission of\n\ninformation between individuals, then any evidence of animal communication\n\nwould serve us, as it served Leroy and Gall, as evidence of human-like speech\n\nin nonhumans.\n Gall and Leroy did not lack intellectual prowess, they lacked\n\nalternative hypotheses with which to explain the behaviours in which they\n\nwere interested. \n\n\n  Attribution of social influences on the development of behaviour\n\nin animals to their use of language disappeared from the scientific\n\nliterature in mid-19th century.\n Unfortunately, explanation of social learning by animals in terms of\n\nhumanlike speech was replaced by an equally misleading, equally\n\nall-encompassing explanation of social influence on behaviour that proved\n\nconsiderably more difficult to reject than Leroy\'s idea that animals talk to\n\none another about matters of importance. \n\n  Darwin, Wallace, Romanes, Morgan ( for much of his life), and\n\nother, lesser known naturalists of the latter half of the 19th century\n\ntreated learning by imitation as the primary way in which animals acquire\n\nadaptive behaviour.\n The ability of animals to learn by imitation was taken for granted.\n The only question to be asked was whether the ability to imitate had\n\nbeen exercised in particular instances of behavioural development ( Morgan,\n\n1896, p. 184). \n\n  Darwin\'s disciple and immediate intellectual heir in behavioural\n\nmatters, George Romanes, was particularly quick to infer that animals were\n\ncapable of  " intelligent perception of the desirability of\n\nmodification [ in behaviour] on the part of certain individuals and to modify\n\ntheir actions accordingly"  ( Romanes, 1884, p. 229).\n " with animals as with men,\n\noriginal ideas are not always forthcoming at the time they are wanted, and\n\ntherefore it is often easier to imitate than to invent."  \n\n  Indeed, whenever Romanes ( 1882, 1884) saw evidence of social\n\ninfluences on learning in animals - whether in groups of newly hatched chicks\n\nlearning to drink water, weanling lambs avoiding ingestion of toxic plants,\n\nor the acquisition of responses by birds of one species to the warning cries\n\nof another - he attributed the adaptive modifications of behaviour he\n\ndescribed to learning by imitation.\n When a cat, resident in Romanes\'s household, learned to open the\n\ngarden gate by jumping up and grabbing hold of the latchguard with one\n\nforepaw, depressing the thumb piece with the other, and simultaneously\n\nkicking at the gate post with her hind legs, Romanes ( 1882) assumed: first,\n\nthat the cat had observed humans opening the gate by grasping the handle and\n\nmoving the latch, second, that the cat had reasoned   " If a hand\n\ncan do it, why not a paw?"   ( Romanes, 1882, p. 422), and,\n\nfinally, that the cat, motivated by this insight, had attempted to open the\n\ngarden gate and succeeded. \n\n  Introspection had convinced Romanes ( 1882) that much of human\n\nbehaviour was learned by imitation.\n Anthropomorphic inference led Romanes to generalize his\n\nintrospections to explain acquisition of novel behaviours by animals, as he\n\nhad explained acquisition of novel behaviours by members of his own species,\n\nin terms of learning by imitation ( see Galef, 1988c, for further\n\ndiscussion). \n\n\n  In the century since Romanes ( 1882, 1884) published his classic\n\nvolumes on comparative psychology, the anthropomorphism so common in\n\n19th-century monographs on animal behaviour has been purged from the\n\nliterature.\n Discussions of animal intentions and intelligent perceptions have\n\nbeen replaced by analyses in terms of stimuli, responses, and reinforcers.\n This reductionist approach to the analysis of behaviour, advocated by\n\nMorgan, Thorndike, and Watson, profoundly influenced not only interpretations\n\nof the results of animal learning studies but also their methods and subject\n\nmatter.\n Anecdotal reports of cats and dogs learning complex motor skills by\n\nimitating their masters have been superceded by controlled experiments\n\nanalyzing the factors influencing association formation in laboratory\n\nsituations.\n The resultant changes in the focus of studies of animal learning\n\ngenerally, and of animal social learning particularly, have proven a major\n\nadvance.\n However, as is often the case, progress was not entirely without\n\ncost. \n\n  The introduction, early in the present century, of experimental\n\nprocedures for investigating association formation resulted in a precipitous\n\nshift in the subject matter of animal development studies.\n Interest in the development of behaviours exhibited by animals\n\noutside the laboratory ( the centre of attention since the time of Aristotle)\n\nwaned.\n Conversely, study of laboratory situations in which abstract\n\nprocesses of association formation could best be observed and dissected\n\nincreased dramatically.\n This shift in locus of attention had a profound impact on the study\n\nof social learning by animals.\n Following Thorndike\'s ( 1898) explicit rejection, on theoretical\n\ngrounds, of the possibility of learning by imitation in animals and failure\n\nboth by Thorndike ( 1898) and by numerous other laboratory workers ( see\n\nHolmes, 1911; Warden & Jackson, 1935; and Washburn, 1908 for reviews) to find\n\nconvincing evidence of animal imitation, discussions of learning by imitation\n\ngradually disappeared from the behavioural literature.\n Such discussions were replaced by attempts to analyze instances of\n\nsocial learning, demonstrated in laboratory situations, as special cases of\n\neither classical or discriminant operant conditioning ( for examples see\n\nChurch, 1968; Miller & Dollard, 1941).\n Study of particular instances of apparent social learning observed\n\noutside the laboratory seemed unnecessary; in time, all instances of\n\nbehaviour acquisition, whether individually or socially based, would be\n\nexplicable in terms of general laws describing all association formation.\n\n\n\n  Meanwhile, in the world outside the learning laboratory,\n\nducklings continued to follow their mothers, song birds went on singing their\n\nspecies-typical songs, and weaning animals continued to choose the same foods\n\nto eat as their more experienced fellows.\n The psychological community simply didn\'t pay attention to such\n\noccurrences.\n Those learning phenomena that could be explained easily within the\n\nframework provided by laboratory learning paradigms received careful study by\n\nnumerous investigators.\n Those instances of animal learning that were more difficult to\n\nassimilate into either of the prevailing laboratory paradigms were largely\n\nignored.\n Experimental, animal psychologists lost interest in carrying out\n\nanalyses of instances of animal learning observed outside the laboratory, at\n\nleast in part because successful study of learning in unconstrained\n\nsituations required an approach quite different both from the informal\n\nanthropomorphizing of 19th-century naturalists and from the paradigm-bound\n\nexamination of associative processes that dominated the study of animal\n\nlearning. \n\n\n  The development by European ethologists of a complementary\n\nframework to that provided by experimental psychology for the study of animal\n\nbehaviour, in general, and animal learning, in particular, provided the\n\nbackground for a resurgence of interest in the study of behaviours that\n\noccurred outside the laboratory.\n Ethologists studied behaviours exhibited by members of particular\n\nspecies in interaction with their respective natural environments.\n Observations of such naturally occurring behaviours served\n\nethologists as a focus for subsequent developmental, causal, and functional\n\nanalyses.\n Consequently, analyses of the behavioural processes supporting\n\nparticular instances of social learning observed in natural circumstances fit\n\neasily into ethologically oriented research programmes. \n\n  Further, ethologists were more eclectic than experimental\n\npsychologists in discussing processes supporting the acquisition of\n\nbehaviour; ethologists had no particular commitment to operant or classical\n\nparadigms as explanatory systems; and they felt no compulsion to study animal\n\nlearning in situations where it might occur  " free from the helping\n\nhand of instinct"  ( Thorndike, 1911, p. 30).\n On the contrary, ethologists treated learning as an adjunct to\n\ninstinctive behavioural sequences ( Tinbergen, 1951). \n\n  Although ethologists both promoted analyses of the development of\n\nbehaviours observed in uncontrolled environments and maintained an eclectic\n\napproach to the study of behaviour acquisition, they lacked a tradition of\n\nsophistication and rigour in the analysis of behavioural development, in\n\ngeneral, and of animal learning, in particular.\n Of course, experimental psychologists had spent decades developing\n\ntechniques that ethology lacked for the study of acquisition processes in\n\nanimals.\n\n\nethopsychological  framework were available that permitted focus on the\n\nquestion of how naturally occurring behaviours might develop and that\n\nprovided methods needed to arrive at satisfying answers.\n In particular, the question of how animals might use information\n\nacquired from others to guide their own behaviour in adaptive directions, a\n\nquestion that, at least implicitly, had been perplexing scientists for the\n\nbetter part of 2 centuries, was finally open to systematic investigation.\n The issue was no longer whether animals could imitate, but, rather,\n\nhow one individual might use the behaviour of others to bias its own\n\ndevelopment in appropriate directions ( Galef, 1989d). \n\n\n  For the past 20 years, my co-workers and I have been studying the\n\nrole of social interaction in the development of adaptive patterns of food\n\nselection by Norway rats (   Rattus norvegicus   ) .\n The immediate goal of this research programme has been to determine\n\nthe behavioral processes that cause one rat to direct its feeding behaviour\n\ntowards the same foods that others of its social group are eating and ignore\n\npotential foods that others of its social group are not eating.\n Equally important, we hoped to develop a general approach to studies\n\nof social learning that would be of use to future investigators of analogous\n\nbehavioral phenomena. \n\n  My co-workers and I began, as any ethologist would, with field\n\nobservations of a possible case of social learning.\n We brought the behavioral phenomenon observed in the field into the\n\nlaboratory and, as any psychologist would, then tried to determine under\n\ncontrolled conditions how one animal influenced another\'s behaviour. \n\n\n  More than 40 years ago, an applied ecologist who was an expert in\n\nthe control of Norway rats discovered that when he used a single poison bait\n\nin a rat-infested area for several months, despite initial success, later\n\nacceptance of the bait was negligible.\n As might be expected, many members of the target population died as\n\nthe result of eating the poisoned bait.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a9e5643b-c1a8-49b9-9b10-55448a2aba5e', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.762808+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9604547023773193, 'non_english_score': 0.039545297622680664}
{'text': "The Object-Line Effect: Is It Attributable to Intercontext\n\nDifferences or the Structural Properties of Contexts and Task Demands? \n\n\n\n \n Briefly presented target lines are reported more accurately when part\n\nof an object-like context than alone ( Williams & Weisstein, 1978).\n Efforts to explain this effect have tended to focus on structural\n\nproperties that contexts must possess in order to be effective in\n\nfacilitating target-line discrimination ( e.g., Weisstein, Williams, &\n\nHarris, 1982).\n Enns and Prinzmetal ( 1984) take issue with this approach.\n They propose that contexts differ more from one another than do target\n\nlines presented alone, and it is this fact, and not the general structural\n\nproperties of contexts, that underlies their effectiveness.\n Two experiments examined intercontext differences and structural\n\nfactors as determinants of context effectiveness.\n Subjects were found to use intercontext differences to narrow the\n\nrange of possible alternatives, but when this factor was controlled,\n\nstructural properties determined context effectiveness.\n The structural interpretation of context effectiveness was found not\n\nto be as straightforward as generally assumed, however.\n A third experiment showed context effectiveness to be affected\n\nby the character of the discrimination task employed. \n\n \n R&Eacute;SUM&Eacute;\n Des lignes-cibles présentées bri&egrave;vement sont\n\nrapportées avec plus de précision lorsqu'elles font partie d'un\n\ncontexte figural que présentées toutes seules ( Williams &\n\nWeisstein, 1978).\n Les efforts pour expliquer cet effet se sont concentrés\n\nsur les propriétés structurales que le contexte doit\n\nposséder en vue de faciliter la discrimination lignes-cibles ( e.g.,\n\nWeisstein, Williams, & Harris, 1982).\n Enns et Prinzmetal ( 1984) ont considéré cette\n\napproche.\n Ils proposent que les contextes diff&egrave;rent plus l'un de\n\nl'autre que les lignes-cibles présentées seules et c'est ce\n\nfait, et non pas les propriétés structurales\n\ngénérales des contextes, qui sous-tend leur efficacité.\n Deux expériences examinaient les différences\n\nintercontextes et les facteurs structuraux comme déterminants de\n\nl'efficacité du contexte.\n On a montré que les sujets utilisaient les différences\n\nintercontexts pour retrécir l'étendue des alternatives\n\npossibles; cependant, quand ce facteur était\n\ncontr&ocircumflex;lé, les propriétés structurales\n\ndéterminaient l'efficacité du contexte.\n L'interprétation structurale de l'efficacité du\n\ncontexte n'était cependant pas aussi évidente que\n\ngénéralement assumé.\n Une troisi&egrave;me expérience a montré que\n\nl'efficacité du contexte était affectée par le carac <l>\n\nt&egrave;re de la t&acircumflex;che discriminative employée. \n\n \n\n  Briefly presented line segments can be discriminated more\n\naccurately within an object-like context than alone ( Williams & Weisstein,\n\n1978).\n This finding has been termed the object-line effect ( OLE).\n It has attracted much attention because it is contrary to\n\nexpectation.\n Normally, briefly exposed, adjacent line segments interfere with one\n\nanother through lateral inhibitory processes ( Breitmeyer, 1984).\n Line segments, therefore, should be more accurately\n\ndiscriminated when presented alone than when included as one of many line\n\nsegments constituting a context. \n\n  Not all contexts are effective in facilitating line\n\ndiscrimination.\n Weisstein and her associates have shown that contexts which are\n\ncoherent ( i.e., present a unitary configuration), connected ( i.e., have a\n\ncontinuous contour), and three dimensional ( i.e., have a depth inducing\n\nperspective) are effective in facilitating discrimination of constituent line\n\ndetail, and contexts lacking these characteristics are not ( e.g., Lanze,\n\nMaguire, & Weisstein, 1985; Lanze, Weisstein, & Harris, 1982; Weisstein,\n\nWilliams, & Harris, 1982; Williams & Weisstein, 1978).\n Weisstein and her associates suggest that structural properties such\n\nas coherence, connectedness, and three dimensionality increase the\n\ndiscriminability of contexts and allow them to be processed more rapidly than\n\ncontexts lacking these properties or target lines presented alone. \n\n  An alternative interpretation of the OLE has been recently\n\nadvanced by Enns and Prinzmetal ( 1984).\n\n\n  focused   on the structural properties of\n\ncontexts, but on the degree to which contexts differ from one another in\n\nappearance and the degree to which such differences are greater than those\n\nevident among target lines presented alone.\n They contend that, in studies demonstrating an OLE, contexts\n\ncontaining target lines differ more from one another than do members of the\n\nset of target lines presented alone.\n Since each different context is associated with a particular\n\ntarget-line location, subjects can use the distinctive appearance of\n\nindividual contexts as a basis for inferring which target line has been\n\npresented.\n Under such circumstances, better performance is to be expected when\n\ntarget lines are presented within contexts than when they are presented\n\nalone.\n The feasibility of the Enns and Prinzmetal approach has been much\n\nstrengthened by their demonstration that intercontext dissimilarity, in\n\nthe absence of any general configural property such as three dimensionality,\n\nconnectedness, or coherence, can generate an OLE and that making\n\ninformation provided by intercontext differences difficult to use reduces or\n\neliminates the OLE. \n\n  The research to be reported examines the Enns and Prinzmetal (\n\n1984) position.\n It was prompted by doubts that the effectiveness of a given set of\n\ncontexts can be wholly attributed to intercontext differences.\n The principal objective was to determine whether context effects\n\nattributable to the stimulus properties of contexts can be demonstrated if\n\nintercontext configural dissimilarities are controlled. \n\n\n  Experiment 1 was a preliminary study with two objectives.\n One objective was to examine Enns and Prinzmetal's ( 1984) claim that\n\nsubjects use intercontext differences correlated with target-line\n\nlocation to specify acceptable alternatives in studies of the OLE.\n The other objective was to try and determine whether, with intercon\n\n<l> text differences controlled, evidence could be obtained to show that the\n\nstructural properties of contexts remain as an important determinant of the\n\nOLE. \n\n\n  : Subjects were required to\n\nspecify the position of a broken target line presented alone and within two\n\nstructurally different types of contexts.\n The two different types of contexts are shown in Panel A of Figure 1.\n It may be seen that each of the contexts was aligned in two different\n\nways.\n Table\n\n  locations were appropriate targets.\n If the long axis of either context was aligned vertically, a target\n\nline could be located on the left or the right.\n If the long axis of either context was aligned horizontally, the\n\ntarget line could occur at the top or bottom.\n Context alignment was thus correlated with target-line location.\n If subjects are as sensitive to configural variations in contexts as\n\nEnns and Prinzmetal ( 1984) suggest, they should readily discern the\n\nconsequences of context orientation and utilize this information to narrow\n\ndown the range of appropriate response alternatives.\n As a consequence, they should make few errors that involve alterna\n\n<l> tives inappropriate with respect to the orientation of a given context.\n\n\n\n  Although the orientation information provided by the two contexts\n\nis identical, the two contexts are very different structurally.\n One context is flat and unconnected, the other is connected and\n\nthree dimensional.\n If Weisstein is correct and the structural properties of contexts is\n\nan important determinant of the OLE, then the connected, three-dimensional\n\ncontext should generate an OLE effect and the flat, unconnected context\n\nshould not.\n Further, any differences generated should not be attributable to\n\nintercontext differences correlated with target-line locations of the\n\ntype described by Enns and Prinzmetal ( 1984).\n connected, three-dimensional context\n\nand a  single  flat, unconnected context, rather than a set of\n\ndifferent contexts exemplifying each context type, eliminates intercontext\n\nconfigural differences of the type described by Enns and Prinzmetal.\n The only variation in context appearance in both connected\n\nthree-dimensional and unconnected two-dimensional forms is that associated\n\nwith orientation, and variations associated with orientation are identical\n\nfor both types of contexts.\n Any overall difference between lines presented in context and alone\n\nshould reflect the ease or difficulty subjects have in determining the\n\nposition of target-line locations as a function of the structural properties\n\nof the two contexts employed. \n\n  An Imagewriter printer directed by an Apple 2e computer was used\n\nto generate the central square of three-dimensional contexts and to introduce\n\nbroken target lines at the requisite positions.\n Angular wing-like appendages were added by a Koh-I-Nor drafting pen\n\nwith a 0.6 mm nib.\n The number and length and type of the line components used in the\n\nunconnected, flat context were the same as those used in the\n\nthree-dimensional context, and the positioning of broken target lines vis\n\n&agrave; vis the fixation point in outer locations of the unconnected context\n\nwas identical to that used in the three-dimensional context.\n The connected and unconnected contexts subtended visual angles of\n\n2.3&degree; and 2.1&degree;, respectively, along the long axis and\n\n1.7&degree; and 1.8&degree;, respectively, along the short axis.\n Target lines subtended a visual angle of 1.1&degree;.\n Eight naive subjects participated in the experiment in exchange for\n\ncourse credit points. \n\n  : A forced choice procedure required\n\nsubjects to specify the position of the target line after each presentation\n\nby pointing to one of the four possible target-line locations displayed\n\non a response card.\n Twenty-four item presentation blocks were used, and within each\n\nblock, target lines appeared alone and in each of the two different contexts\n\nequally often.\n Both context orientations and all four target-line locations were\n\nsampled equally often within each block.\n Drawings of various contexts and lines examined were provided before\n\nthe start of the study and were available for consultation throughout the\n\nexperiment.\n No information was provided about the fact that horizontal and\n\nvertical alignments of contexts could be used to narrow the range of relevant\n\ntarget-line locations.\n To familiarize subjects with the general procedure, a block of\n\npractice presentations preceded the eight blocks of experimental presen <l>\n\ntations.\n A Gerbrands two-field tachistoscope was used to present stimuli.\n A uniformly illuminated preexposure field containing a small\n\nfixation dot preceded and followed the exposure field.\n As in the Enns and Prinzmetal ( 1984) study, subjects were required\n\nto maintain a predetermined level of accuracy in responding.\n The required accuracy level of 50-70% correct responding was\n\nestablished by holding the illumination level of the exposure field of the\n\ntachistoscope fixed at 1.7 cd/m  2  and varying the illumination\n\nlevel of the uniform field preceding and following the exposure field.\n The preliminary practice period was used to establish an appropriate\n\nperformance level.\n As in the Enns and Prinzmetal study, further adjustments were made,\n\nif necessary, only at the end of a presentation block after all conditions\n\nhad been presented an equal number of times.\n The mean level of illumination of the field which preceded and\n\nfollowed the exposure field was 3.1 cd/m  2  .\n A fixed exposure duration of 20 ms was used throughout the study.\n Subjects were provided no feedback with respect to the accuracy of\n\ntheir responses during the study. \n\n\n  To determine whether typically observed object-line effects were\n\nevident, the proportion of presentations on which target lines were\n\ndesignated correctly was tabulated for each condition.\n The mean proportion of target lines correctly specified was higher\n\nfor target lines within the connected, three-dimensional context than within\n\nthe flat, unconnected context or than when presented alone ( .82, .59, & .55,\n\nrespectively).\n An analysis of variance applied to arc sine transformed proportions\n\nindicated that presentation conditions differed reliably,  F  (\n\n2, 14) = 13.46,  p  < .001. \n Planned comparison tests showed that target lines were discerned\n\nsignificantly more accurately in the three-dimensional context than in the\n\ntwo-dimensional context,  t  ( 14) = 4.81,  p \n\n< .05, or than when presented alone,   t  ( 14) = 4.20,  p \n\n< .05. \n Differences in the accuracy with which target lines were\n\ndiscriminated in the flat, two-dimensional context and line-alone condition\n\ndid not differ reliably.   \n\n  Finding that the two contexts differed in the degree to which\n\nthey facilitated target-line location supports the Weisstein et al. ( 1982)\n\nposition that structural properties of contexts are important, but is\n\ndifficult to reconcile with the approach of Enns and Prinzmetal ( 1984).\n According to Enns and Prinzmetal, pronounced intercontext\n\nconfigural differences have to be evident among the exemplars of a given con\n\n<l> text type, and these differences have to be correlated with target-line\n\nlocations for variations in context effectiveness to be manifest.\n In the present study, each context type was represented by a single\n\nconfiguration.\n The only variation in contexts correlated with target-line\n\nlocation was that associated with context alignment, and that, as has been\n\nnoted, was identical for both context types. \n\n  To determine whether subjects took advantage of context alignment\n\nto narrow the range of appropriate alternatives, the total number of errors\n\nmade by each subject were divided according to whether the alternative\n\nselected matched the orientation of the target line presented or was\n\nnonmatching, that is, orthogonal to the orientation the target line\n\npresented.\n An analysis of variance carried out on the error data indicated that\n\nthere were reliable main effects for error type,  F  ( 1, 7) = 5.67,\n\n p  < .05, presentation conditions,   F  ( 2, 14) = 12.69,\n\n p  < .001, and an interaction between presen tation conditions and\n\nerror type,  F  ( 2, 14) = 32.22,  p  < .001. \n The summary of error data provided in Table 1 shows that the most\n\nimportant factor contributing to the interaction is the marked difference in\n\nerror patterns between the context and line-alone conditions.\n In context conditions, errors involving appropriately oriented\n\nalternatives were more common than errors involving inappropriately oriented\n\nalternatives, whereas in the line-alone condition the reverse was true.\n Why errors involving inappropriately oriented alternatives were twice\n\nas frequent in the line-alone condition ( 19.63 vs. 9.50) as errors\n\ninvolving appropriately oriented alternatives is difficult to understand.\n Inspection of presentation sequences and tabulation operations\n\nreveals no indication of anomalies that could account for the effect.\n Although not readily explained, the distribution of error types in\n\nthe line-alone condition is of only limited interest.", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '437f8980-323c-4f6c-8f48-43fea6bce75f', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.764143+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9023343324661255, 'non_english_score': 0.09766566753387451}
{'text': "This book is about the political belief systems of new elites, the\n\nyouth elites of the 1980s, in the Anglo-American democracies - the old\n\nstates.\n The similarities and differences among and between the political\n\ncultures of Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States\n\nhave been probed, debated, re-examined, and debated again for more than half\n\na century.\n In the 1960s, newly developed cross-national survey techniques\n\nproduced evidence that added fuel to those speculations.\n Remarkably, however, no cross-national attitudinal research comparing\n\nall five countries followed the path-breaking studies of the 1960s.\n This study aims to go some distance towards filling that gap, and the\n\nargument it proposes is a simple one.\n Enormous changes swept across all advanced industrial states during\n\nthe last two decades.\n The Anglo-American democracies, like other countries, experienced the\n\nglobalization of their economies, the information revolution, profound\n\nstructural transformations, and dramatic shifts in population\n\nreplacement.\n Long-standing patterns of political behaviour eroded, traditional\n\nalliances unravelled, and new issues forced their way onto political agendas.\n The ideological climate of the 1980s, we suggest, bore little\n\nresemblance to the ideological climate of the 1960s and, for a variety of\n\nreasons, those shifts in ideology were disproportionately concentrated in the\n\nranks of the new generations.\n In what respects, then, are the political belief systems of new\n\nelites in the Anglo-American democracies similar?\n In what respects are they different?\n\n\nparative cross-national survey evidence from all five countries. \n\n  This book is written with a broad audience in mind.\n Our aim is to make the results of the study accessible to those\n\nwithout formal training in quantitative methods and to those who are being\n\nintroduced to, or who have a general interest in, the contemporary politics\n\nof the Anglo-American democracies.\n Where possible, we present our findings by way of graphic\n\nillustrations.\n Where we resort to summary statistical presentation of evidence,\n\nwe rely on relatively few simple measures, which are explained in the text.\n Our hope is that this study will contribute to a revitalized debate\n\nabout politics both in and between each of the five countries as well as\n\nabout the transformation of advanced industrial states in general. \n\n  This project was truly a collaborative effort.\n We drew heavily upon the goodwill of many colleagues and institutions\n\nin all of the five countries represented in the study.\n We are happy to be able to acknowledge publicly our gratitude for\n\ntheir help. \n\n  The study was ten years in the making.\n In the late 1970s, while orchestrating the Cross Naional Survey\n\nProject, Sidney Verba co-ordinated a number of brainstorming sessions at the\n\nCenter for International Affairs, Harvard University, dealing with the\n\nopportunities, difficulties, and practicalities of cross-national survey\n\nresearch.\n It was during those stimulating meetings that the prospect of\n\nundertaking a comparative Anglo-American study was first discussed.\n This project would never have been started, undertaken, or completed\n\nwithout the intellectual leadership and moral support of Sidney Verba.\n We thank him for allowing us to use the American data for this\n\nproject.\n More importantly, we are very grateful for his continual\n\nencouragement. \n\n  Several other institutions and individuals were also crucial to\n\nthe project.\n The Australian field work was conducted from the Australian National\n\nUniversity at both Canberra and Darwin.\n The University of Essex gave us work space from which we co-ordinated\n\nthe British segment of the study.\n Tony King, Ian Budge, and Ivor Crewe were very gracious hosts.\n Nigel Roberts and Rod Alley made the New Zealand component of the\n\nstudy possible.\n And in Canada we were willingly aided in a variety of ways by\n\ncolleagues across the country.\n We particularly appreciate the contributions of Herman Bakvis,\n\nAndré Blais, Marsha Chandler, Jean Cr&ecircumflex;te, Barry Kay,\n\nRichard Johnston, and Richard Simeon.\n Some of the analysis was undertaken at the Center for Political\n\nStudies, University of Michigan.\n\n\n  The project placed a unique burden on our own institution, the\n\nUniversity of Calgary. For steering us through a maze of computing\n\nrelated matters we are grateful to Thomas Huang and Ted Ziajka.\n We were very lucky to have extremely able research assistants: Robert\n\nBurge got the project underway and Lori Galbraith held it together, carrying\n\nthe bulk of the computational and graphics work through to its conclusion.\n We are very appreciative of their efforts and abilities.\n We also thank our colleagues in the department of political science\n\nfor their congenial support. \n\n  The Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada\n\nprovided the financial wherewithal for the project (  SSHRC\n\n grant\n#410-88-0221).\n We thank them not only for underwriting the hard costs but also for\n\nproviding sabbatical leave fellowships that enabled us to conduct the field\n\nwork and to start attacking the analysis.\n Several individuals provided us with constructive criticism of\n\nthe early drafts of various parts of the book.\n Seymour Martin Lipset, Paul Sniderman, and Sylvia Bashevkin were\n\nparticularly helpful.\n Robert Boardman, Jon Pammett, and Campbell Sharman read the entire\n\nmanuscript and provided both thoughtful commentary and a number of helpful\n\nsuggestions.\n We are very grateful to them, and to Richard Teleky, managing editor\n\nof Oxford University Press, who coaxed us along with the manuscript. \n\n  Both of us borrowed time from our families.\n We extend a special thanks to Susan Bloch-Nevitte and Isabel Gibbins,\n\nwho were understanding when we fell short on what we imagine to be the normal\n\nresponsibilities of spouses in normal families.\n Neil Nevitte\n Roger Gibbins\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n 1   in the five Anglo-American democracies - Australia,\n\nBritain, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States.\n Perhaps no other five countries in the industrialized world are more\n\nalike; they share not only roughly comparable economies, social\n\nstructures, and cultural environments, but also the same political tradition.\n Compared with other industrially advanced states, each of the\n\nAnglo-American democracies has a long history of open, stable, and liberal\n\ndemocratic style of government.\n For the most part, citizens of the Anglo-American democracies view\n\ntheir systems of government as legitimate, and the transfer of power has\n\nrarely taken place in an atmosphere of crisis; it has been routine.\n Throughout this century political contests have not been battles\n\nabout the rules of the game; instead, the battles have been about ideas,\n\npolicies, leaders, and parties. \n\n  It is not surprising, then, that comparative social scientists\n\noften regard the Anglo-American democracies as a special subset of advanced\n\nindustrial states, a distinct analytic category.\n This practice gained considerable momentum in the 1950s and early\n\n1960s with the publication of such landmark works as Louis Hartz's \n\nFounding of New Societies  , Alexander Brady's  Democracy in the\n\nDominions  , Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba's  Civic Culture \n\n, and Robert Alford's  Party and Society  .\n These studies, along with a number of influential articles by Seymour\n\nMartin Lipset, Gabriel Almond, and others, all underscored the same point:\n\nAustralia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States were all\n\n 'different examples of the same type'  .\n 'climate'\n\n or  'spirit'  of politics in the five states.\n Others identified secularism and homogeneity as the unifying\n\nthemes, while yet others pointed up similarities in styles of political\n\ncombat and political values - pluralism, pragmatism, individualism, and the\n\nnon-ideological sense of compromise.\n The language differed but the message was the same - all five\n\ncountries shared a common political culture beyond what one might expect from\n\ntheir similar status as Western industrialized states. \n\n  By the middle of the 1960s, however, the conceptual tide turned.\n Armies of scholars drawing upon a variety of analytical traditions,\n\nand working from national rather than cross-national perspectives, challenged\n\nthe notion that the Anglo-American democracies were  'essentially the\n\nsame'  .\n 'significant\n\ndifferences'  existed, and could be traced to variations in\n\nfounding traditions.\n Variations in political institutions, social structures, and literary\n\ntraditions were probed to bolster the case for the essential differences\n\nbetween national political cultures.\n Canadian scholars, for example, reacting perhaps to concerns\n\nabout the  'Americanization'  of Canadian culture, entered the\n\nfray contending that the differences between Canadian and American values\n\nwere not  'mere nuances'  , but fundamental.\n American analysts, meanwhile, busily mounted a powerful and\n\nincidentally complementary case for American exceptionalism.\n Throughout the Anglo-American democracies, the effort and\n\nconclusions focused on contrasts, not similarities. \n\n  Today the friction between these two visions persists, and in the\n\nfinal analysis it hinges on one central empirical question: Are there\n\nsignificant differences between and among the contemporary political cultures\n\nof the five Anglo-American democracies?\n Certainly there are countless national arguments to support, for\n\nexample, the expectation that the political culture of Australia will differ\n\nsignificantly from that of Britain, and that of Britain from the political\n\nculture of the United States.\n For readers and scholars in those countries whose main concern is to\n\nexplain national political cultures to domestic populations, idiosyncratic\n\nfeatures are often to be treasured and vigorously defended.\n At the same time, however, we have compelling reasons to expect\n\ncultural similarity.\n The Anglo-American democracies not only share the structural\n\ncharacteristics common to all industrial states; they also share a\n\ncommon political tradition.\n Thus the expectation of similarity is driven not only by more general\n\npatterns of structural and ideological convergence within the Western world,\n\nbut also by history.\n At root, however, remains the basic empirical question: Are there\n\nsignificant national differences in political culture?\n Until and unless such differences can be demonstrated, it is\n\npremature to speculate on the reasons why national differences might persist\n\nin an era of global ideological convergence. \n\n\n  Our entry into this debate about cross-national similarities and\n\ndifferences in political values is shaped by three themes that regularly\n\nemerge in these disputes.\n First, we accept, of course, that competing interpretations of\n\nthe same phenomena are a normal part of academic debate in all disciplines,\n\nas are attempts to resolve discrepancies of interpretation.\n In this instance, for example, it might be argued that the\n\ndifferences between the two visions of the Anglo-American democracies can be\n\nsquared away simply by acknowleging that each operates at a diferent level of\n\ngeneralization.\n 'important\n\ndifference'  easily fades into insignificance when global comparisons\n\nare entertained.\n Australians and Canadians might be expected to be alert and sensitive\n\nto differences between the two countries, whereas an observer from Africa\n\ncould be excused for emphasizing their similarities ( climatic differences\n\nnotwithstanding!).\n But that line of reasoning is not entirely convincing either, because\n\nit obscures the fact that much of the debate centres around the same unit of\n\nobservation - national values - and that the empirical question still remains\n\nas to whether or not significant differences exist. \n\n  Second, most comparative judgements about values in the five\n\nAnglo-American democracies rely almost entirely upon indirect evidence.\n National differences in crime rates, for example, might be used to\n\nspeculate on the importance of citizen deference to political elites in\n\nthe civic cultures of the countries under examination.\n However, forming conclusions about contemporary public attitudes\n\non the basis of inherited political institutions and social patterns is\n\nrisky and contentious.\n It is equally hazardous to rely on a theory about founding traditions\n\nto make inferences about the national values of populations several\n\ngenerations removed from founding circumstances.\n The problem is that to get from institutional, social structural,\n\nliterary, and historical evidence to conclusions about national values\n\nin the 1980s and beyond requires a logical leap of faith.\n Many of the existing studies that rely on these impressionistic\n\nsources are both imaginative and persuasive, but they do not escape the\n\nlimitations of having to rely on inference.\n This debate about comparative similarities and differences has raged\n\nnow for more than twenty-five years, during which time comparative social\n\nscientists have continued to use the Anglo-American democracies as a major\n\nanalytic category.\n From that standpoint, it is remarkable that no single study has ever\n\nprovided direct comparative evidence of national values in all five\n\ncountries. \n\n  Third, and relatedly, if claims to the effect that the\n\nAnglo-American democracies share  'essentially the same political\n\nvalues'  ring hollow in the absence of direct evidence of those\n\nsimilarities, then so do counterclaims about national uniqueness.", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '9c2f336a-95a1-4897-a07e-06cbc5cdb1f8', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.765573+00:00', 'english_score': 0.951001763343811, 'non_english_score': 0.048998236656188965}
{'text': 'WARREN BENNIS, in his recent book,\n\n Why Leaders Can\'t Lead  , has suggested that:\n In the 1960s, we wanted to make the world better.\n In the 1970s, we wanted only to make ourselves better.\n Now, at the start of the 1990s, we seem to be uncertain about whether\n\nwe can make anything better.   1    1. Warren\n\nBennis,  Why Leaders Can\'t Lead  ( San Francisco, CA:\n\nJossey-Bass Publishers, 1990), p. xiii.     \n\n  Clearly, such a negative view of possibilities has not\n\nprevailed on the educational scene over the past decade.\n Indeed, education has been bombarded with a staggering variety of\n\nproposed changes in recent years.\n Consider a few examples:\n "\n\ndismal failure"  of Canada\'s education system is to refuse anyone a\n\ndriver\'s license until high school is completed.\n &bullet; Several provinces have moved toward increased amalgamation\n\nof school districts as a means of improving efficiency.\n &bullet; Singer Joni Michell is reported to have suggested at an arts\n\neducation conference that the way to produce more artists is to\n\ndiscourage them.\n &bullet; One of the restructuring initiatives undertaken in a U.S.\n\nschool included the local decision to operate with no principal, but\n\ninstead have five management leaders and 17 committees.\n &bullet; Japanese educational authorities, long characterized in this\n\ncentury as operating the  " model"  education system, are\n\nseriously reviewing North American education because they are concerned about\n\nthe lack of creativity developed in Japanese schools.\n "\n\nbonuses"  to schools exhibiting good standardized test scores.\n &bullet; And in the United Kingdom, long considered a bastion of\n\nlocal school autonomy in curriculum, the central authority has moved toward a\n\nnational curriculum. \n\n  Virtually every western nation and every Canadian province is\n\nundergoing some form of educational reform.\n The real challenge for many becomes one of understanding these\n\nproposals, many of which seem contradictory and some simply ludicrous. \n\n  The way we make sense out of experience is, of course, very\n\nindividual.\n "\n\ncognitive maps,"  in the hope that readers might better understand\n\ncurrent developments and inform themselves for more effective practice.\n Any such attempt would seem to require an indication of the\n\nreasons for action or change, the nature of proposed changes, and the methods\n\nof implementing change. \n\n\n  The voices of demand for improvement in our schools are\n\nmany, varied, and increasingly insistent, but they can probably be grouped\n\nunder two main headings. \n\n  - From within the educational establishment\n\nitself - classrooms, schools, districts, professional associations,\n\nuniversities - come many of these pressures for change. \n\n  Partly, this relates to our knowledge base, which has been\n\ngrowing and developing.\n The practical realities that teachers face from day to day ( for\n\nexample, the recognition of just how difficult it is to motivate the\n\nunwilling learner or to make learning meaningful to students who are subject\n\nto so much stimuli) provide much cause for the search for better approaches.\n\n\n\n  Add to this the theoretical contributions to our knowledge\n\nbase.\n The increased understanding from cognitive psychology of\n\nhow we must place new learning into our own individual meaningful  "\n\nwhole"  or context, or the recognition of Piagetian developmental\n\nstages, are examples of knowledge that place demands on us for change. \n\n  But we also deal constantly with the awareness of unrealized\n\nexpectations in education.\n For how many decades have we known that elementary school science\n\nshould be a much richer experience for students, yet we\'ve managed to change\n\nso little?\n If critical thinking has been a goal of education for the past half\n\ncentury, why does there seem to be so little evidence of its presence in\n\neveryday life? \n\n  - To these voices from within education must\n\nbe added many external concerns. \n\n  Economic realities play a very important part in these external\n\ndemands.\n Not only do we face stress from dimishing public resources for\n\neducation, but the economic environment has changed to the point where there\n\nis little place left for the unskilled in our society.\n So we hear strident voices crying over a dropout rate that would have\n\nbeen considered unimaginably good a few decades ago.\n Can the schools actually develop in all students a level of skill and\n\nknowledge which not long ago was required only of the relatively few?\n\n\nproblem-solving ability as necessary in a complicated post-industrial\n\nsociety? \n\n  And then, of course, we have the pressures of social changes.\n The list seems endless: sexually transmitted diseases, drugs,\n\nviolence, family and community breakdown, a more scientifically and\n\ntechnically based workplace - all demand the school\'s attention. \n\n\n  The demands for change identified above do not lead to a single\n\nconclusion.\n In fact, they not only become mixed, indistinct, and unclear, but\n\noften exist in some tension.\n be a warm, caring\n\nplace where students can find comfort from the fractured home or community in\n\nwhich they exist, for example, is not necessarily compatible with the need\n\nfor more effort, and a more harshly competitive economic climate.\n Similarly, the pressures for reduced drop-out rates may conflict with\n\ndemands that all students have a higher level of technical and\n\nscientific literacy.\n of these demands\n\ncan produce greatly variant conceptions of what the school should be. \n\n  One useful approach is to consider these different pictures of\n\neducation metaphorically.\n "\n\nshould be"  seem common.\n\n\n\n  is presented as\n\nfollows:\n If we expect children to participate fully and equally\n\nin this democratic society, they must learn a  common, shared\n\nfoundation  of knowledge, as well as certain  common beliefs\n\n and standards of conduct  [ Emphasis added].  2 \n\n  2.\n Royal\n\nCommission on Education  ( Victoria, BC 1988), p. 94. \n\n   \n\n  Clearly, this is a picture of the Factory - a place where the\n\nemphasis is on productivity, uniformity and quality control.\n And although educators may recoil at the coldness of that picture,\n\nthey also would find it difficult to disagree with the need for common\n\nlearning and a guarantee of success. \n\n  A modification of this metaphor is heard in the vision of a\n\n " technological laboratory". \n This is still an uncommon view, but increasingly the school of the\n\nfuture is pictured as one dominated by computerized learning, with\n\nwell-programmed software leading all students, on an individualized basis, to\n\nmastery of essential skills and knowledge. \n\n\n  In a department store, or a large convention, we can pick\n\nand choose according to our interests.\n\n ...the larger challenge for the provincial system rests\n\nin attempting to establish what one scholar describes as  " a system\n\nof plurality of excellence"  ... a variety of career paths in formal\n\nschooling leading to different types of high level competence other than\n\nacademic ability.  3    3.\n A Legacy for Learners: The Report of the Royal Commission on\n\nEducation  ( Victoria, BC: 1988), p. 104.   \n\n \n\n  Clearly this metaphor places stress on variety and choice.\n Indeed, in many circles there are suggestions that the choice\n\nshould be extended not only to students in school, but also to parents for a\n\nchoice of the school their children attend. \n\n\n  There are few parents, when sending their first child off to the\n\nfirst day at school, who do not at heart wish that the school will, after\n\nall, be not that different from home - a kind of second family, where love,\n\ncompassion, and co-operation prevail.\n And certainly that desire is echoed by many in society who see the\n\nschool as too harsh, too unsuited to  individual needs and\n\naspirations. \n\n\n  If the family metaphor comes primarily from parents, a\n\nclosely allied picture comes mainly from educators - the view of the school\n\nas a garden ( or perhaps more correctly, an  " untended meadow"\n\n ) , a place where beautiful things grow at their own rate and in\n\ntheir own manner, if only educators provide the right conditions.\n The school, according to this conception, should be characterized by\n\ngrowth, beauty, diversity, and interest.\n\n ... I turn to an activity, a purpose, which really\n\nwarms me - the facilitation of learning.\n When I have been able to transform a group - and here I mean all the\n\nmembers of a group, myself included - into a community of  learners\n\n , then the excitement has been almost beyond belief.\n To free curiosity; to permit individuals to go charging off in new\n\ndirections dictated by their own questioning and exploration; to recognize\n\nthat everything is in process of change - here is an experience I can never\n\nforget.  4    4.\n ( Columbus, OH.\n\nCharles E. Merrill Publishing, 1969).     \n\n\n  One only need imagine a sportscaster ludicrously commenting on a\n\n100-metre dash,  " That was a wonderful race, with no winners,"\n\n to realize the nature of this image.\n For the Olympics are meant, through competition, to bring out the\n\nbest in competitors.\n And while the stress on winners in this metaphor may seem\n\ninappropriate, with slight modification we can all see merit in a conception\n\nof school which sets hurdles and demands excellence. \n\n\n  The vivid pictures we have seen in recent years of the masses\n\nmarching for freedom in Eastern Europe or China call forth this metaphor - a\n\npicture of the school as a place for developing some passion over a\n\nworthwhile cause.\n The voices raised for environmental education or Canadian\n\nidentity have this common theme: school should instil in students, indeed\n\nindoctrinate them, with this intense desire to do something worthwhile.\n\n\n\n\n  The medical model of a clinic, where the patient is referred for\n\nsuccessively more sophisticated investigations and diagnostic procedures, has\n\nits reflection in an image of the school.\n model of\n\nspecial education services, for example, the school should be characterized\n\nby much more precision, as we seek to find the problem in someone\'s inability\n\nto learn, and to fix it. \n\n  The purpose in describing these varying concepts of the\n\nschool is not to denigrate any.\n Indeed, each has some validity in responding to some of the demands\n\nfor change.\n But we should note that these views are often in conflict.\n The result, once again, is part of the tension faced in schools, at\n\nthe board table, and in communities. \n\n\n  At this point, a digression is necessary to outline a framework\n\npresented by John Ingalls.  5    5.

Ingalls,\n\n Human Energy  ( Don Mills, ON: Addison-Wesley, 1976), pp. 9-18.\n\n\n Ingalls has suggested that people have two major categories of needs,\n\nwhich in turn lead to two major types of behaviour.\n Type A Behaviours he identifies as those which represent the\n\nbasic human  need for certainty  , while Type B Behaviours are those\n\nrepresenting a capacity for tolerating  ambiguity or uncertainty\n\n .\n\n\n  major point is that both types of behaviour are\n\nnormal, natural, and universal and, in fact, are required in our society.\n Type A Behaviours, which express our needs for certainty, are the\n\nbasis for all rationality.\n They are, in fact, behaviours of control which represent our efforts\n\nto  " make sense of things,"  and hence they diminish the\n\ndegree of freedom and spontaneity which exists.\n Type B Behaviours, on the other hand, tend to be very accepting, and\n\nhence reduce conflict; however, if they alone are present, they would make\n\nany concerted effort virtually impossible. \n\n  One can speculate that just as such behaviours are natural and\n\nnecessary for individuals, so are they for organizations.\n Both types of behaviour, for example, can be considered essential in\n\nschool systems.\n One type is ideally suited to obtaining maximum information which is\n\na required condition for effective problem-solving.\n The other enables some consistent and co-ordinated effort\n\ntoward common goals. \n\n  This framework can be applied to the variant metaphors or\n\nconceptions of the school.\n Certainly it seems reasonable to suggest that the concepts\n\nunderlying metaphors of the Factory, Olympics, and Freedom March appeal to\n\nthe need for certainty, control, and consistency. \n The Department Store, Garden, Family metaphors, however, present\n\nconceptions of education that provide for behaviours leading to\n\nambiguity, variety, and creativity.\n The clinic can respond to the need for either kind of behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n  Although most would probably accept the internal and external\n\nfactors that demand change, reaching decisions on the desirable types of\n\nchange is much more of a problem.\n Even if such consensus is reached, we also face a variety of\n\navailable approaches to implementing a model of the  " new school."\n\n \n\n  Here again, the educational techniques and the leadership\n\napproaches at our disposal can be categorized under the two types of needed\n\nbehaviours. \n\n  Some significant techniques fall under both headings.\n In the interest of promoting greater consistency, certainty,\n\nand control, for example, we use core curriculum, objectives and\n\ndirections, mastery learning, textbooks, and high student expectations.\n Leadership approaches that create a common vision, or depend\n\nupon centralized decision-making, tend to promote consistency types of\n\nbehaviours as well. \n\n  In the interests of promoting variety, ambiguity and creativity,\n\non the other hand, we use curricular electives, increased professional\n\nautonomy, individualization, a variety of learning materials, and\n\nstudent interest.\n Leadership approaches that increase personal freedom or rely on\n\nhuman relations skills have similar purposes. \n\n  Once again, we observe a certain degree of conflict and tension\n\nbetween the behaviours or approaches we use to promote consistency and\n\ncontrol and those required to encourage variety and creativity.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b4c11e5c-9083-42bb-8b9d-21858d2fb433', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.766916+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9636698365211487, 'non_english_score': 0.03633016347885132}
{'text': 'If one were to ask the majority of sociologists to define the\n\nscope and substance of sociology in a few sentences, they most likely would\n\nreply in something like the following terms.  \n Sociology is a social science devoted to the study of human groups of\n\nall kinds and all sizes.\n A group may be defined as two or more interacting individuals.\n The interaction of individuals gives rise to a variety of social\n\nrelations and social processes such as cooperation, competition, conflict,\n\nand domination.\n The full range of human behavior and relations is the subject matter\n\nof sociology. \n\n  because our main\n\nintellectual aim is to comprehend and explain the workings of the social\n\nworld.\n Like all sciences, sociology pursues truth and knowledge by employing\n\nmethods of inquiry based on logic and evidence and by subjecting theories and\n\nfindings to an ongoing critical examination.   \n\n  However, the statement we have placed in the mouths of our\n\ncolleagues tends to exaggerate their unity of outlook.\n The differences among sociologists are often as significant as their\n\ncommon ground.\n Some sociologists imitate the methods of the natural sciences and see\n\nthemselves working in close parallel with physicists and chemists; other\n\nsociologists believe they share the aims of novelists and poets.\n Between those extremes there is a wide range of research methods,\n\ntechniques, ideas, and just plain notions.\n Nevertheless, the several different sociologies do have something in\n\ncommon that may be called the sociological  perspective  or \n\napproach  . \n\n  The essentials of the sociological approach are best conveyed by\n\nintroducing the student to the pioneers of sociological theory and analysis\n\nwho wrote in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n Their works are now regarded as the classic tradition of sociological\n\nthinking because they have stood the test of time.\n pioneers\'\n\n theoretical ideas; we employ their concepts; we continue to investigate\n\nquestions they raised; and, finally, we emulate their intellectual\n\ncraftsmanship.\n In a word, the classic tradition provides the theoretical foundations\n\nof the sociological perspective. \n\n  In this introduction we cannot fully convey the intellectual\n\nriches of that tradition, nor can we dwell on the specific works and ideas of\n\nthe thinkers who contributed to it.\n Those are among the tasks of this book as a whole.\n All we can do here is to provide a general idea of the tradition\'s\n\nsignificance. \n\n  Not all sociologists would agree on the thinkers to be included\n\nin the classic tradition.\n Some of our colleagues would have longer lists than others.\n However, most lists would have to include at least three of the\n\nmasters who receive detailed consideration in this book: Emile Durkheim, Karl\n\nMarx, and Max Weber.\n Although the names of these men are not likely to mean anything to\n\nthe beginning student, we mention them here and postpone introducing\n\nthem until the appropriate contexts in the following chapters. \n\n  The founders of the discipline which we today call sociology did\n\nnot necessarily look upon themselves as professional sociologists.\n One finds in their writings an exploration of the full scope of the\n\nhuman condition.\n They freely availed themselves of the intellectual resources of\n\nanthropology, psychology, history, economics, and philosophy.\n Today those fields of study are distinct academic disciplines with\n\njealously guarded borders.\n But for the classical sociological thinkers, academic boundaries were\n\neither nonexistent or quite fluid.\n They were more interested in addressing significant questions than in\n\nremaining faithful to this or that academic area. \n\n  It is therefore in the spirit of the classical tradition that\n\nsociology is conceived of and introduced in this book.\n Following in the footsteps of the pioneering masters, we shall try to\n\nfocus attention on key questions.\n In the remainder of this introduction, we merely raise some of those\n\nquestions in the hope that the student will agree on their importance and\n\nlook forward to addressing them. \n\n\n  What are the similarities and differences between humans and\n\nother living creatures?\n It is true that human beings share many physiological characteristics\n\nwith some other members of the animal kingdom.\n But is it not also true that the human possesses something more than\n\nthey do?\n\n\n  A related issue is the nature of human nature.\n Is the human being driven by instincts, by internal, genetically\n\ndetermined biopsychic forces?\n Are humans innately aggressive, as Konrad Lorenz and other\n\nprestigious students of animal behavior have alleged?\n Or to take an opposing but equally influential view, are humans\n\nwholly determined by external, environmental factors?\n The psychologist B. F. Skinner, for example, has claimed that human\n\nbeings are passive entities totally shaped by external stimuli.\n\n\n" will,"   " mind,"   " self,"  and\n\nother forms of consciousness are just so many illusions.\n Finally, there is the question raised anew in recent years by\n\nsociobiologists: How do the principles of human social organization compare\n\nwith those on which animal societies are based? \n\n  As one shifts attention to large human organizations and\n\nsocieties, new theoretical problems emerge.\n How does a society establish and maintain order; that is, ensure a\n\nmeasure of internal peace that will enable its members to attend to their\n\nvital affairs?\n What is the connection between order and justice?\n That question was skillfully explored by the renowned French\n\nsociologist Emile Durkheim, who noted that modern industrial society is\n\nlargely based on formal contractual relations.\n Contracts are often made between social unequals, where one party\n\ndominates and the other has no choice but to serve or to suffer worse\n\nconsequences.\n Durkheim\'s reply, as we shall see, raises the critical question of\n\nwhether a social order resting on basic social inequalities can be stable.\n\n\n\n  However, the social theorist who raised that question most\n\ndramatically was Karl Marx, the well-known nineteenth-century writer whose\n\nideas have had so much political influence in the present century.\n Sociologists have increasingly recognized that Marx made significant\n\ncontributions to sociological theory and analysis, especially for the study\n\nof social classes and social change.\n Though Marx and Marxism are highly controversial subjects, we shall\n\ntry to discuss his work objectively, with the aim of highlighting his\n\nsociological contributions. \n\n  is the term sociologists employ\n\nto describe the study of inequalities based on wealth, power, prestige, and\n\nother social conditions.\n Key questions are: How do basic social inequalities come about?\n How are they perpetuated?\n Are modern societies still structured along social-class lines?\n Some sociologists favor a social-class type of analysis; others do\n\nnot.\n Some sociologists believe that basic social inequalities can be\n\nreduced and even eliminated.\n Others insist on the necessity of social inequality, arguing that a\n\nsociety\'s social positions must be stratified and that the rights and duties\n\nassociated with those positions must be unequal.\n Similarly, some theorists hold that throughout history, from the dawn\n\nof civilization to the present, two classes of people have been evident: One\n\nthat rules and another that is ruled.\n That state of affairs has prevailed whether government has been\n\ndespotic, aristocratic, democratic, or what have you.\n Moreover, the division of society into rulers and ruled, those\n\ntheorists maintain, is inevitable and bound to persist so long as there are\n\nhuman societies on earth.\n We shall subject several such theories to close scrutiny.\n We argue that inequalities can be reduced to a degree, although they\n\nare without doubt stubbornly persistent.\n We also sketch some of the main changes that have taken place in the\n\nclass structures of Canada and other societies, especially during the\n\ntwentieth century, and outline some of the forces likely to cause more change\n\nin the near future. \n\n  One very clear manifestation of social inequality is the status\n\nof ethnic and racial minorities.\n Ethnic and racial minorities the world over have continued to suffer\n\nfrom a variety of disabilities, including prejudice, discrimination,\n\nsegregation, exploitation, and persecution.\n The vastness of the subject constrains us to focus attention on\n\nminorities in Canada.\n We demonstrate that race and ethnicity have roots that are more\n\nsocial than biological or purely cultural.\n We show, moreover, that while most immigrant groups experience\n\nconsiderable upward mobility in Canada, certain groups, notably French and\n\naboriginal Canadians, experience persistent inequality as conquered peoples.\n Thus, we agree only in part with John Porter, one of the founding\n\nfathers of Canadian sociology, who saw Canada as a country of fewer mobility\n\nopportunities. \n\n  have been central to the concerns\n\nof sociology from its very inception.\n In the language of sociology, an institution is a firmly established\n\nsocial practice together with its accompanying form of organization.\n Examples of major institutions are the family and religion.\n In our discussion of the family, we shall concern ourselves mainly\n\nwith the question of whether the family is in a state of decline.\n We demonstrate that nuclear families ( composed of a married man and\n\nwoman living with children) are becoming less common all the time and now\n\ncomprise only a fifth of Canadian households.\n We examine a variety of factors that help account for the\n\nproliferation of family forms: the increased participation of women in the\n\npaid labor force, the increased use of various means of birth control, the\n\nincreased acceptability of homosexuality, and so forth.\n Paradoxically, we conclude that the family is not in a state of\n\ncrisis; in our judgment the growth of various family forms yields increased\n\nfreedom for family members. \n\n  In studying the institutions of religion, sociologists concern\n\nthemselves with the connections between religious phenomena and other facets\n\nof social life.\n What are the social roots of the idea of the divine?\n Why is a belief in the divine found in all societies?\n Why is the sacred everywhere sharply distinguished from the profane?\n Is religion a positive phenomenon in that it meets certain basic\n\nsocial and individual needs?\n Or is it injurious to humans, blinding them to reality and\n\nforestalling a rational understanding of their actual circumstances?\n Is the influence of religion declining in modern society?\n To shed light on those and other intriguing questions, we employ the\n\nclassical writings of William James, Emile Durkheim, Bronislaw Malinowski,\n\nSigmund Freud, Karl Marx, and Max Weber. \n\n  Besides institutions, another central concern of sociology is to\n\nunderstand social movements and other forms of collective behavior.\n Why and how do some small groups become mass movements?\n Throughout history we see evidence of concerted social action on the\n\npart of large numbers of people.\n Religious, political, and other social movements appear again and\n\nagain.\n We analyze the rise of Naziism in Germany in the 1930s, and the\n\ngrowth of the  and  movements in Canada in\n\nthe twentieth century.\n These case studies demonstrate how a variety of social factors -\n\ndiscontent, ideology, leadership, and power resources - shapes the success or\n\nfailure of collective attempts to change society. \n\n  Another major area of sociological concern is deviant behavior or\n\nthe question of why some people deviate from the norms ( rules, standards,\n\nand laws) of society.\n Crime is an example of deviant behavior.\n What makes a person become a criminal?\n replies to that question are\n\nthat a criminal is an abnormal human being afflicted with some defect that\n\naccounts for his or her deviance or that a criminal is an atavism, a kind of\n\nthrowback to an earlier evolutionary stage who possesses ferocious instincts.\n This last view was in fact the doctrine promoted by a well-known\n\nnineteenth-century criminologist, Césare Lombroso. \n\n  However, Lombroso\'s younger contemporary, Durkheim, had a quite\n\ndifferent view of the matter.\n In his pioneering sociological analysis, he put forth the\n\nproposition that deviance, like conformity, is firmly rooted in social\n\nconditions.\n Building on the work of Durkheim, we address such matters as how an\n\nindividual becomes a criminal, the nature of lower-class criminal\n\nsubcultures, the higher incidence of certain types of law violations in the\n\nAmerican ghettos and among aboriginal Canadians, white-collar and corporate\n\ncrime, and, finally, the gender distribution of crime.\n How do societies change?\n What processes account for the transformation of society and\n\nculture?\n Urbanization, for instance, had a beginning and can be traced to the\n\nancient Near East.\n On the site of biblical Jericho, archeologists have uncovered in the\n\noldest strata the remains of a community dating back to the eighth millennium\n\nB.C.\n Those strata appear to be evidence of the earliest human settlement\n\non record.\n Another of the earliest human settlements is Jarmo, located on the\n\nfoothills running along the Tigris-Euphrates plain between Iraq and Iran.\n Archeological methods ( carbon-14 tests) indicate that farming\n\ncommunities existed in that region by about 6750 B.C.\n However, neither of those ancient settlements, though large and\n\nproto-urban in some respects, were true cities.\n Rather, they were tangible evidence of the Neolithic Revolution,\n\nwhich prepared the way for genuine urbanization.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5926bc1a-7212-4547-b8bc-9b4606d5b9ae', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.768381+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9658104181289673, 'non_english_score': 0.034189581871032715}
{'text': "The roots of the federal New Democratic Party lie in the Great\n\nDepression of the 1930s.\n In 1932, 131 delegates from a variety of organizations gathered\n\ntogether in Calgary and decided to form the  'Co-operative\n\nCommonwealth Federation ( Farmer, Labour, Socialist)'  .\n A year later, the CCF held its first annual convention in Regina and\n\ndrafted the Regina Manifesto, a statement of principles that is for many the\n\ntouchstone of Canadian socialism.\n CCF\n\n , celebrates sixty years of  CCF-NDP \n\nhistory.\n Without a doubt, the party can take much pride in its political\n\naccomplishments.\n But that pride is combined with serious reflection and critical\n\nself-appraisal regarding the past, and some concern about the future. \n\n  stalled as a third\n\nparty?\n Has it largely failed in its efforts to be more successful than its\n\npredecessor, the  CCF  ?\n Why, despite its image repackaging, does the NDP continue to make so\n\nlittle progress in Quebec?\n What are the long-term prospects in the industrial heartland of\n\nOntario?\n Is the party's provincial base in the west still its main strength?\n ceased to provide a clear\n\nsocialist alternative to the two old-line parties?\n become more a brokerage party\n\nand less an ideologically-based movement?\n\n\nnot made greater gains?\n In providing an overview of the party, particularly during the 1980s,\n\nthis chapter will suggest some preliminary answers to these questions, which\n\nwill be considered in more detail in later chapters. \n\n\n \n\nCCF  vote dropped consistently in the four subsequent elections:\n\nto 13.4% in 1949, 11.3% in 1953, 10.7% in 1957, and 9.5% in 1958.\n\n\n<fnr> the  CCF  was clearly on the path to oblivion.\n But the birth of the NDP gave new electoral vitality to Canada's\n\nsocialist movement.\n Winning 13.5% of the vote in its maiden election, in 1962, the NDP\n\ndid better than had the CCF in all but one of the elections it contested.\n NDP\n\n has acquired 17.2% of the vote, as compared with 11.1% for the\n\n CCF  - a clear gain of 6.1%, and a 55% increase over\n\nits forerunner's record.\n NDP\n\n has gained a higher percentage of votes than the  CCF\n\n did even in its best year, 1945. \n\n \n\nreceived more than 20% of the federal vote: this was in 1988, when the party\n\nexceeded its 26-year average ( 1962-88) in every province or region except\n\nManitoba and Nova Scotia ( see Appendix Table 1).\n Although it has increasingly surpassed the 20% barrier in Gallup\n\npolls, <fnr>  2  <fnr> it has not yet become a major party on the\n\nbrink of power. \n\n  NDP\n\n 's electoral support shown improvement over the  CCF\n\n 's in all regions equally.\n Regionalization between and within parties is a fact of life in\n\nCanadian politics, and the  CCF-NDP  is no exception.\n When data are compared regarding the average federal vote by province\n\nfor the  CCF  and the  NDP  (\n\nsee Table 1.1), we find that in Saskatchewan support has declined from 34.7%\n\nfor the CCF to 32.4% for the NDP.\n The biggest drop was in the years 1962-65, when the province returned\n\nno NDP MPs - the only period in the combined history of the federal\n\n CCF-NDP  that this has been so.\n Several factors offer explanations: ( 1) resentment over the\n\ntransformation of the  CCF  into the  NDP\n\n in the only province where the  CCF  had\n\nformed a government; ( 2) disappointment over T.C. Douglas's departure from\n\nSaskatchewan politics to return to Ottawa; and ( 3) growing disenchantment\n\nwith the provincial  CCF  as it neared the end of its\n\nsecond decade of uninterrupted power. \n\n  was formed with urban,\n\nlabour-oriented Ontario in mind, and it was in that province that its\n\ngreatest increase in support occurred: from a 10.7% average for the\n\n CCF  to a 20.0% average for the  NDP\n\n .\n The party has seen a virtual doubling of its Ontario vote, a\n\nseven-fold increase in the average number of seats won per election ( from\n\njust over one in the  CCF  era to eight), and an\n\nequally large increase in the percentage of its total seats coming from that\n\nprovince ( from 7.1% to 31.1%).   \n\n  was an electoral disaster in\n\nQuebec, where it averaged a mere 1.5% of the vote.\n Some problems were present right from the start.\n Few Francophones attended the founding convention, and the name Co\n\n<l> operative Commonwealth Federation did not translate well into French.\n Most of Quebec's Roman Catholic population, and particularly its lead\n\n<l> ership, regarded the party as atheistic, materialistic, and\n\nanti-clerical. \n stressed the\n\nneed for a strong federal government and central planning at the expense of\n\nprovincial powers and jurisdiction - another point on which most Quebeckers\n\nwere especially sensitive.\n\n\nCCF  reinforced the CCF's image as a party antithetical to French\n\nCanadian interests. \n\n  Another reason for the NDP's creation was to make a new and\n\nbetter start in Quebec.\n While no significant breakthrough has yet occurred in a general\n\nelection, the  NDP  , with an average 8.1% of the\n\nvote, has fared much better than did the  CCF  .\n its\n\nthird-largest increase in votes over the  CCF  , and\n\nthe third-highest percentage of the party's total votes ( 12.5%); judging by\n\nthe 1988 election, more than one in ten  NDP  voters\n\nare now located in Quebec.\n NDP MP\n\n in a general election, the party has on two separate occasions\n\nacquired a solitary Quebec  MP  ; once by means of a\n\ndefection from the Conservatives ( Robert Toupin, from 1987 until 1988) and\n\nonce, more significantly, through a by-election victory ( Phil Edmonston in\n\nChambly   in 1990).\n Whether these small steps are indicative of potentially greater\n\nfuture gains for the  NDP  in Quebec, particularly\n\nduring a general election, remains to be seen. \n\n  has been better able than\n\nthe  CCF  to establish a presence in all parts of\n\nCanada can be seen both in the greater percentage of ridings in which it has\n\nrun candidates ( 61.3% for the  CCF  vs. 96.0% for the\n\n NDP  )  and in the fact that\n\nit has increased its vote in almost all regions of Canada ( see Table 1.1).\n NDP\n\n in the province in which its record has been the worst - Prince\n\nEdward Island - is still higher than the CCF's average in several provinces.\n\n\n\n  has often been portrayed as a\n\nwestern protest movement ( e.g., Lipset, 1968: 188).\n Certainly its leaders came from the west, as did the vast majority of\n\nits MPs ( 89.3%) ( see Table 1.2). \n However, there has been a tendency by many to overestimate\n\nwestern and  'farmer'  input in the  CCF\n\n vote while underestimating eastern and  'labour' \n\nsupport.\n The CCF's electoral support was greater in the west ( 59.3%),\n\n but not to the degree often assumed ( see Table\n\n1.3): on average, 40.7% of its total votes came from the east.   \n NDP\n\n 's founding, Ontario provided more of the  CCF\n\n 's votes than did the Prairies.  \n\n  NDP\n\n , the more populous east ( i.e., Ontario and Quebec), not\n\nsurprisingly, accounts for the larger proportion: 60.5%, as compared with\n\n39.6% from the west.\n Total votes, however, are far from the only criterion.\n The NDP's representation in Parliament continues to have a western\n\norientation, with 67.3% of its seats coming from the west.\n days,\n\nbut still somewhat at variance with the party's total votes. \n The 1988 election continued this pattern of asymmetry between total\n\nnumber of votes and seats.\n Nevertheless, the imbalance in distribution of seats does\n\nreflect the higher average levels of support for the  NDP\n\n in the west ( X'=25.0% of all votes cast, vs. X'=10.7% for the\n\neast). \n NDP\n\n votes in three western provinces: 44.2% in Saskatchewan, 37.0%\n\nin British Columbia, and 17.4% in Alberta. \n\n \n\nretains a very strong western orientation.\n On the one hand, 1987 data on the 276,128 members of the party\n\naffiliated indirectly through unions <fnr>  10  <fnr> ( see Table\n\n1.4) indicate that the east in general and Ontario in particular accounted\n\nfor the overwhelming majority ( 79.5% and 76.0% respectively)     .\n 11\n\n <fnr> ( see Table 1.5) reveal that 73.0% of these were found in the\n\nwest.\n To a considerable degree this may reflect the\n\n<NDP's strong provincial bases in this re gion, since federal-party members\n\nare also simultaneously provincial-party members ( except in Quebec from\n\n1989 onwards).\n Until the 1990 upset victory in Ontario, the only provinces in which\n\nthe  CCF-NDP  had formed governments were in the west:\n\nfrom 1972 to 1975 in British Columbia, from 1944 to 1964 and 1971 to 1982 in\n\nSaskatchewan, from 1969 to 1977 and 1981 to 1988 in Manitoba, and from 1985\n\nto the present in the Yukon.\n Any decline in the party's provincial fortunes in the west,\n\ntherefore, is likely to have an effect upon the federal party's position in\n\nterms of both membership and finances. \n\n \n\ngovernment had been dramatically defeated in 1982.\n The party received only 37.2% of the vote, its worst showing in\n\nforty-four years, and went from 44 seats to 8, the most precipitous drop\n\never for the provincial  CCF-NDP  in Saskatchewan (\n\nFox, 1982: 682-4).\n base\n\nremained, and in the provincial election of 1986 the party received\n\n45.2% of the vote, a sizeable increase from 1982.\n In fact, this was the highest vote for any of the parties - and\n\nhigher than in 1975, when the  NDP  had formed the\n\ngovernment.\n But because the electoral system was weighted more heavily to the\n\nless populated rural ridings, the  NDP  won only 25\n\nlegislative seats ( Fox, 1987: 414-15); the Conservatives, with only 44.6% of\n\nthe vote but 38 seats, formed the government and stalled Allan Blakeney's\n\nattempted comeback.\n It would remain for Roy Romanow, Blakeney's successor in the province\n\nthat pioneered Canada's socialist programmes, to return the provincial\n\n NDP  to power.\n 's record-high 1988\n\nfederal vote in Saskatchewan gave renewed reason for optimism on the eve of\n\nthe 1991 provincial election, which was fought on the issues of\n\nprivatization, government decentralization ( Pitsula and Rasmussen, 1990),\n\nand the economic plight of Prairie farmers.\n Romanow was elected Premier with over 50% of the vote and a massive\n\n55 of 66 seats.\n\n\nfold. \n\n  NDP\n\n , which had formed the government under Dave Barrett from 1972\n\nto 1975, failed twice to return to power.\n However, with 44.2% of the vote in 1983, and 42.6% in 1986, down\n\nslightly from its previous high of 45.2% in 1979, the party was still in good\n\nhealth organizationally, and the record-high vote and seats won in the\n\nprovince in the 1988 federal election were promising.\n The ongoing financial scandals of Bill Vander Zalm's Social Credit\n\ngovernment and the lacklustre performance of his successor Rita Johnston\n\ncontributed to the collapse of the Social Credit vote in the 1991 provincial\n\nelection.\n vote itself again fell\n\nslightly to 39.8%, it was still sufficient to thwart the resurgent Liberal\n\nParty.\n won 51 seats and provincial leader\n\nMike Harcourt became Premier of British Columbia. \n\n  The NDP's greatest success stories in the 1980s were its two\n\nprovincial victories in Manitoba.\n\n\nnot only won the most seats in its history ( 34), but also received its\n\nhighest vote ever ( 47.4%).\n In 1986, despite a decline in its vote to 40.6% ( second place to the\n\nConservatives), the party retained a slim majority of seats ( 30, to the  26) and continued, albeit precariously, as the provin <l>\n\ncial government for another two years.", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'dbbf52dc-932a-4799-b305-af704110378f', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.769967+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9742673635482788, 'non_english_score': 0.02573263645172119}

was paid less.\n I do have a lot of responsibility and I think my contribution is as\n\nvaluable as their contribution, and my salary should be at least equal ....\n\n\n\n  Investigation into the income differences between women and men\n\nhas been dominated by three types of studies: quantitative estimations by\n\neconomists and sociologists of the components of the gendered wage gap;  estimations of the actual or expected economic and\n\nemployment effects of equal-pay legislation;  and\n\nlegal analyses of the grounds for litigation ever unequal pay. \n There have been virtually no analyses of the dynamic political\n\nstruggles along class and gender lines over the formulation of legislation on\n\nequal pay for equal work, or equal pay for work of equal value. \n\n  The purpose of this book is to examine the three basic areas in\n\nwhich the political struggles over pay equity have been waged.\n ( offices and\n\nfactories), the capital and labour  marketplace  ( where jobs are\n\nobtained in exchange for wages), and the  household workplace \n\n( where the work involved in bearing and raising children is performed).\n Most of the examples in this book are drawn from the federal levels\n\nin Canada and the United States, the provinces of Manitoba and Ontario, and,\n\nto a lesser extent, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. \n\n  The first thesis of this book is that in both countries a\n\ncoalition of business and neo-conservative anti-feminist organizations has\n\nopposed equal pay for work of equal value by seeking to restrict questions of\n\ngender-based income to non-discriminatory factors in the household and\n\nmarketplace, and to prevent state intervention in the capitalist\n\nworkplace and marketplace.\n At the same time, a feminist-labour alliance of women\'s organizations\n\nand trade unions has supported state intervention in the form of equal pay\n\nfor work of equal value by struggling to place responsibility for unequal pay\n\non the shoulders of employers in the workplace, who by their discriminatory\n\nhiring and promotion practices have, in effect, taken advantage of women\'s\n\ndouble day of labour in the household and the paid labour force.\n The polar-opposite participants in these struggles have been\n\nactivist trade-union and new middle-class women on the one side and senior\n\ncorporate executive men on the other.\n Corporate women have leaned towards gender rather than class in\n\nsupporting pay equity, though not without some compromise with their\n\nprivileged class position.\n After decades of socialization into patriarchal ideologies;\n\ntrade-union men have leaned towards gender and class interests to support\n\nequal-pay legislation, though not without a painful struggle with their\n\nsister unionists.\n In danger of being left out of the struggle over pay equity\n\naltogether, men in the new middle class of professionals, managers, and\n\nintelligentsia in both the public and private sectors have been pulled\n\ntowards both sides.\n This split has been especially evident among male economists,\n\ncorporate consultants, lawyers, media writers, and state bureaucrats, al <l>\n\nthough their centre of gravity, especially in the United States, appears to\n\nhave shifted somewhat to an ideological defence of the male business-class\n\nposition.  \n\n \n\nden agenda in the campaign for equal pay for work of equal value is the\n\ndestruction of the patriarchal nuclear family.\n Giving women pay equivalent to men\'s would make them less dependent\n\non men, loosen their ties to the home, and provide them with greater\n\nincentive to pursue careers outside.\n It has therefore been important for anti-feminist\n\nneo-conservatives to maintain the traditional separation between the public\n\nsphere of the state, the capitalist workplace, and the marketplace, and the\n\nprivate sphere of the household, since they see the labour and women\'s\n\nmovements as attempting to link them in assessing the causes of, and recom\n\n<l> mending the solutions to, unequal pay.\n The irony is that feminist and labour organizations have not\n\nforcefully made such links between the private and public spheres, even\n\nthough they have often been made by both socialist and radical feminists.\n\n\n\n  In each of the three areas of struggle ( paid workplace,\n\nmarketplace, and household workplace), the focal points are class and gender.\n A third issue, race / ethnicity, has often been pushed into the\n\nbackground  , and in response, women-of-colour or\n\n<l> ganizations have fought to bring this issue to the centre of pay-equity\n\nstruggles. \n A dialectical relation exists between the structures and struggles of\n\nclass, gender, and race / ethnicity: even though the structuring of class,\n\ngender, and race / ethnicity imposes limits on the kinds of struggles\n\nthat can emerge, class, feminist, and anti-racist struggles may set the\n\nagenda as to the content of structural changes that will occur through\n\nequal-pay legislation.\n For example, the structural differences in wealth between white\n\nbusinessmen and visible-minority working-class women has meant that the\n\nformer could use high-priced lawyers and consultants in lobbying governments\n\nover pay equity while the latter could not.\n Structure thus places limits on struggles.\n At the same time, the struggle by trade unions and working-class\n\nwomen\'s organizations to ensure that pay equity is not achieved simply by\n\nlowering the wages of men has put so much pressure on governments that they\n\nhave inserted clauses in pay-equity acts forbidding employers to lower men\'s\n\nwages to equalize the pay between women and men.\n Thus struggles affect the content of structural changes in women\'s\n\nand men\'s wages.\n As noted in Appendix A, in the 1980s the women\'s movement has become\n\nmuch more conscious of racism both in the broader society and within itself.\n But business and neo-conservative elements within the new middle\n\nclass have sought to exploit racial and ethnic ( as well as gender) divisions\n\nin both the women\'s movement and the labour movement in order to divide the\n\nsolidarity of the campaign for a political solution to gender-based unequal\n\npay.\n Trade unions and visible-minority women\'s organizations have fought\n\nback by minimizing their internal racial, gender, and class differences. \n\n \n\n, a second thesis will be suggested in Chapter 5: that ( a) racist and\n\nanti-feminist neo-conservative elements, reacting to a perceived threat to\n\nthe patriarchal nuclear household from the labour-feminist alliance, have\n\ntried to fracture the solidarity of the labour and women\'s movements along\n\nthe lines of classism, racism, and sexism; and ( b) patriarchal capitalist\n\nstates have tried to co-opt these movements by framing weak pay-equity\n\nlegislation containing numerous loopholes and defects that make it difficult\n\nfor women to win pay-equity adjustments.\n The legislation of equal pay for work of equal value, although a\n\nvictory for feminists and trade unionists, also represents an attempt on the\n\npart of the state to co-opt the labour and women\'s movements not only on\n\nbehalf of business, anti-feminist, and neo-conservative interests, but at\n\ntheir behest. \n\n\n  Six caveats are in order here.\n First, this book deals almost exclusively with those\n\njurisdictions where equal-pay-for-work-of-equal-value legislation is now in\n\nplace.\n of such legislation in\n\nAlberta, British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Saskatchewan.\n And it pays only cursory attention to developments in Prince Edward\n\nIsland and Nova Scotia, both of which legislated equal pay for work of equal\n\nvalue in the public sector in 1988, and in Quebec, which legislated proactive\n\nequal value in its human-rights law of 1975. \n\n  Second, although it is possible to analytically separate the com\n\n<l> ponents of the gendered wage gap in terms of workplace, marketplace, and\n\nhousehold, those three areas overlap considerably: together they form a\n\ntriangle, with each merely an extension of the other two. \n\n  Third, the intricacies of the strategies negotiated between\n\nwomen\'s groups and labour organizations, and the gender tensions between\n\nthem, are not dealt with in detail in this book.\n That is a separate research project requiring intensive in-depth\n\ninterviewing of participants in both kinds of organizations as they\n\ndevelop their respective tactics in the fight for pay equity. \n\n  Fourth, the intricate process of collective bargaining over the\n\nsetting up of job-evaluation and pay-equity plans - in other words, the\n\nimplementation of legislation, once it is on the statute books - is not\n\ndiscussed.\n This is another subject that requires a separate project, based,\n\nagain, on in-depth interviewing of participants in the process. \n\n  .\n Although working-class trade-union organizations have clashed with\n\nbusiness-class associations over the shape of pay-equity legislation,\n\nthere is a sense in which class has not been a consideration.\n Framers of pay-equity legislation have tended to ignore the question\n\nnot only of ethnic and racial differences, but also of class differences, in\n\nfavour of an exclusive emphasis on gender differences in rates of pay.\n There has been little discussion of the value of working-class labour\n\ncompared to that of the work performed by managers and employers, the class\n\nsuperiors of workers.\n In a retrospective critical examination of equal pay for work of\n\nequal value, George Ehring, legislative assistant in the NDP caucus of the\n\nOntario legislature, observed:   \'What we really need is a\n\nmechanism that compares the relative value of the work performed by\n\nsecretaries, childcare workers and hair-dressers with that of their bosses.\'\n\n   \n\n  The sixth caveat is the most difficult to discuss.\n There is considerable ambiguity in the literature as to the precise\n\nmeanings of " \'equal pay\' " , " \'equal work\'\n\n" , " \'equal value\' " , " \'equivalent\n\nvalue\' " , " \'comparable worth\' " , and " \'pay\n\nequity\' " .\n " \'Equal work\' " is based on comparisons between\n\njobs that are identical.\n " \'Similar work\' " depends on comparisons between\n\njobs that are similar or substantially similar.\n " \'Equal value\' " or, to use the American term,\n\n" \'comparable worth\' " , is based on comparisons between\n\njobs that may be quite dissimilar but that can be equated in terms of a\n\ncomposite of effort, skill, responsibility, and working conditions ( some\n\nsubdimensions of these four factors are listed in Appendix B).\n The ambiguity in the use of these terms reflects in part the nature\n\nof class and feminist struggles as business and anti-feminists attempt to\n\nrestrict the meaning of pay equity to equal pay for identical or similar\n\nwork, while labourites and feminists attempt to broaden the term to include\n\nequal pay for work of equal or comparable value. \n\n  The Vancouver Women\'s Resource Centre has raised the question of\n\nwhether the state has used the term " \'pay equity\' " -\n\nrather than the more potent " \'equal pay for work of equal value\'\n\n" - to co-opt or defeat the feminist drive for truly equivalent\n\nwages between women and men.\n One example might be the use of " \'pay equity\' " in\n\nthe 1987 Ontario Pay Equity Act, which went into effect on 1 Jan. 1988. \n As this Act was being debated and amended between 1985 and 1987,\n\nlobby groups on both sides of the issue widely interpreted it to mean equal\n\npay for work of equal value.\n Although the term " \'equal value\' " appears in the\n\nAct, the complete phrase "  \'equal pay for work of equal value\'\n\n " does not, despite the efforts of the Ontario Equal Pay\n\nCoalition to have it inserted. \n In 1989, after the dust in the debate had settled, the Ontario Pay\n\nEquity Commission stated that  equal pay for work of equal value \n\nmeans that  \'male and female employees must be equally compensated\n\nwhere work undertaken within an establishment is of equal value.\n Jobs are deemed to be comparable where the same skill, effort,\n\nresponsibility and working conditions apply.\'  \n \'a policy\n\nor legislated provision requiring that work performed by women which is\n\ncomparable in value to that performed by men in the same establishment should\n\nbe paid the same.\n Jobs are evaluated according to the composite of skill, effort,\n\nresponsibility and working conditions.\'  \n These two definitions look the same.\n abstract\n\nprinciple  of equal pay for work of equal value and the  concrete\n\nlegislation  of pay equity?\n The Pay Equity Commission has pointed out a significant difference:\n\nequal pay for work of equal value is  \'often interpreted more broadly\n\nthan the concept of pay equity in that it is not necessarily restricted to\n\nsystemic discrimination in compensation based on gender\'  .\n Although the commission does not say so, an example of such\n\ndiscrimination might be that directed against \'visible minority groups\'.\n Yet the equal-value language occurs throughout the Ontario Act, and\n\nlobby groups and the public should be forgiven if they confuse the Act with\n\nequal pay for work of equal value. \n Why would the state, after passing a pay-equity act incorporating the\n\nequal-value principle, now point to a difference between pay equity and\n\nequal pay for work of equal value?\n Why would it now raise the issue of non-gender grounds of\n\ndiscrimination when it always resisted extending pay equity to these areas?\n Is the reason to reassure business and neo-conservatives that the\n\nprovincial state has not, in fact, implemented equal pay for work of equal\n\nvalue?\n Or is the state now agreeing with women-of-colour organizations that\n\nequal pay for work of equal value should be implemented on non-gender\n\ncultural grounds as well?', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "*An earlier version\n\nof this chapter was read and commented upon by Sandra Burt, Henry Jacek, and\n\nLeslie Pal.\n I wish to thank them for their assistance and to absolve them of any\n\nblame for the shortcomings of the final product. \n\n  Political science assumes that sound analysis has to be built on\n\ncategorization.\n Without having defined what we are studying we cannot observe it,\n\nmeasure it, or describe it - and therefore we cannot make verifiable general\n\nstatements about it.\n This chapter will look at the progress - or lack of progress - that\n\npolitical scientists have made in building a system of categories to\n\ninvestigate the relationship between a country's general political\n\nsystem and the pressure groups that work within it.\n\n\n\n  Pressure group studies boast remarkably few efforts to build\n\nsystems for categorization ( also known as typologies or taxonomies).\n Perhaps this is because it is quite easy to identify and to study\n\nformal interest groups that indisputably fit a broad definition, such as the\n\none presented in the first chapter, once one has been agreed upon.\n Pressure groups are clearly not political parties ( they seek\n\ninfluence, not power), not government agencies ( they make their own\n\ndecisions and appoint their own officers), and not even interests ( they are\n\ndefined as being formal associations).\n Scholars may quarrel over marginal cases, but the broad category,\n\npressure groups, is generally recognized.\n Consequently the literature is full of case studies - many of them\n\nexcellent - of particular groups and observations of groups engaged in\n\nvarious phases of pressure politics.\n There is even a growing number of empirical studies of groups that\n\nare clearly alike, such as business interest associations. \n\n  These studies tell us a lot about how groups have adapted to\n\ndifferent political systems and have exercised influence.\n They are not, however, very helpful when we try to develop general\n\ntheories of political life.\n They do not help us make verifiable generalizations about the\n\npolitical behaviour of organized groups, about their relationship to the\n\nstate, or about their role in political systems, and it is very hard to set\n\nout a grand theory that does not include such generalizations.\n Of course, political scientists, myself included, have succumbed to\n\nthe temptation to propose grand theories, but we all know that these theories\n\nare little more than informed speculation, flawed because the studies on\n\nwhich they are based are not comparable.\n While such studies generally share a common definition of the term\n\n 'interest / pressure group'  - although even here, as we have\n\nseen, differences persist - there is only rudimentary agreement about the\n\nkinds of interest groups that are to he found.\n This prevents us from understanding why very different kinds of\n\npressure groups emerge, why their behaviour varies, and why some groups\n\nappear to be more influential than others.  *   *Two\n\nfactors may be forcing us to become more rigorous.\n First, the growth of empiricism in social science has fostered\n\nprecision in definition and led to increasingly accurate observation of\n\npressure groups.\n Second, the popularity of comparative studies has encouraged us to\n\nwork out an analytical terminology that permits accurate    comparison   .\n The corporatists have contributed significantly to this effort.\n\n \n\n  Before exploring these issues more fully, it is useful to review\n\nthe principles that guide categorization.\n We can apply those principles to some of the rudimentary typologies\n\nthat have been used in studying pressure groups, and use them to build a\n\nsystem of categories of our own.\n The principles we shall draw upon, which have been widely used in the\n\nsocial sciences, can he expressed as five rules: \n\n\n  The categories must be set up to address an explicitly defined\n\nresearch problem.\n Interest Groups and the\n\nBureaucracy  , divides the groups in his study of California energy\n\npolitics into two categories: cost-bearers and beneficiaries.\n This approach is pertinent to a case study that tries to explain\n\ngroup behaviour in a single policy dispute, but it would not help us classify\n\ninterest groups in general because groups are seldom consistently\n\ncost-bearers or beneficiaries. \n In other words, the categories may vary a good deal according to our\n\nresearch interests, but it is important to ensure that they are appropriate\n\nto the research question being addressed. \n\n\n  The categories should take into account every type of group that\n\nexists in the system under study.\n If we want to study the pressure group system in a country, we cannot\n\nbe content with a typology that captures only business, women's, or religious\n\ngroups. \n\n\n  The categories should be mutually exclusive and independent.\n This is a most difficult requirement, but it is essential since it\n\nforces us to discriminate between groups and allows us to explore their\n\ndifferences.\n The distinction between 'public interest groups' and 'special\n\ninterest groups' is popular because a public interest can be distinguished\n\nfrom a private, or special, interest.  *   *Later we will\n\nshow that this popular view can be misleading. \n On the other hand, even though a distinction between 'lobby' groups\n\nand 'protest' groups is equally popular because it evokes colourful images of\n\nthe different behaviour of the 'ins' and the 'outs', the distinction is not\n\nhelpful analytically.\n This is because so-called 'protest' groups often lobby and\n\noccasionally even powerful lobby groups protest.\n The activities of protesting and lobbying, in other words, do not\n\nconsistently differentiate groups. \n\n\n  We cannot build individual categories by combining\n\ncharacteristics that have been established on the basis of different\n\nprinciples.\n For example, when we refer to organizations as 'business', 'environmental',\n\nor 'civil rights' groups we are implicitly using a single principle to\n\ndifferentiate them.\n In this case, we are sorting them out according to their central\n\nobjectives, which we have concluded are to promote business, or environmental\n\nconcerns, or the protection of civil rights.\n Suppose that we tried to combine this principle with another one: the\n\nlevel of organizational complexity attained by each group.\n How would we do it?\n Would we say that all business groups are highly organized and all\n\nenvironmental groups not?\n If we were to do so, how would we categorize Greenpeace, which, with\n\nits extensive international network, is a highly complex environmental group\n\n- probably more complex than most business interest associations.\n Clearly, by combining two different methods of distinguishing\n\ngroups we make the task of sorting them out much more difficult, if not\n\nimpossible.\n We would be better off if we analysed one category in terms of\n\nanother; we could look at protest groups, for example, to determine how many\n\nare highly organized, weakly organized, and so on. \n\n\n  Each set of categories enables us to carry out analysis at a\n\nspecific level.\n A set of categories designed to study the pressure groups operating\n\nin a particular policy field will not help us examine the efforts made by\n\npolitical parties, lobbying firms, corporations, officials, and individuals\n\nto influence those policies.\n To do that, we would have to move to the next level of analysis, the\n\npolicy system, and to employ a new set of analytical tools.  \n\n  How well do our categories for pressure groups adhere to these\n\nrules?\n When we set out to distinguish pressure groups from other political\n\nactors we seem to be on firm ground.\n The distinctions drawn between pressure groups, parties, government\n\nagencies, and so on in Chapter 1 have been generally accepted for a number of\n\nyears and have helped keep us from violating the level of analysis precepts\n\nof Rule 5.\n Similarly, we have learned to distinguish between the three types of\n\ninterests - latent, solidary, and organized or formal - and to maintain a\n\nclear distinction in analysis between organized groups and the other two\n\ntypes.  \n\n  organized\n\npressure groups we run into trouble, largely because we tend to ignore our\n\nfirst rule of categorization.\n We do not keep in mind the research questions that different methods\n\nof categorization are designed to address.\n Consequently we often fall into the trap of using a category designed\n\nto explore one question to address others.\n Equally, there is a danger of criticizing a typology developed for\n\none purpose simply because it does not address another.\n To ensure that the following critique avoids this trap, we will\n\nbriefly consider the research question that a general typology should\n\naddress. \n\n  The questions at the heart of political science have to do with\n\npower, specifically, the power of the state - what it consists of, how it is\n\nused, who gets to use it, when and where.\n Pressure groups, by definition, do not seek to use state power\n\ndirectly, but rather to influence it.\n Consequently, the broadest and central questions that political\n\nscientists ask when they study pressure groups have to do with how groups\n\nexert influence and how their efforts are received by the state.\n In short, they are most concerned with the relationship between the\n\nstate and pressure groups.\n There are, of course, many other questions political scientists ask\n\nabout pressure groups - questions about how groups determine which issues\n\nthey will pursue and about the effect membership characteristics and opinions\n\nhave on group behaviour, for example - but the core questions have to do with\n\nstate / group relations and all others are subsidiary.\n Any method of classification intended for general use in political\n\nanalysis should be designed to address this central concern.\n Guided by this conclusion, the critique that follows is intended to\n\nassess the capacity of widely used typologies to assist our explorations of\n\nthe core questions of political science.\n It should be remembered that typologies shown to be inadequate for\n\nthis level of analysis may be extremely useful in addressing other questions.\n\n\n\n  Two methods of categorization are popular with academics,\n\njournalists, and interest group members themselves.\n The first divides organized groups according to their objectives -\n\nprotest, environmental, civil rights, and public interest groups, to name a\n\nfew.\n Collectively those groups that pursue public-regarding objectives are\n\noften referred to as 'public interest' groups, while those that attend to the\n\nexclusive and generally material benefits of their members are often labelled 'special\n\ninterest' groups.\n The second classifies by the character of the members - business,\n\nethnic, or women's groups for example. \n\n  Research that applies this two-fold division of groups shows that\n\nit fails to conform to two of our five rules of categorization, and therefore\n\nfails as a typology.\n\n\nment that a category should be based on a single principle.\n Some scholars assure us that despite the considerable overlap between\n\ngroups that fall into the material benefit category and those designated as\n\nattitude groups,  'one is able to assign a group to one or the other\n\ncategory quite easily'.   \n This is not in fact the case.\n It is extremely difficult to show that there are characteristics\n\nunique to groups in each category. \n\n  A good illustration is found in Jeffrey Berry's survey of 83\n\npublic interest groups based in Washington in the early 1970s and his case\n\nstudies of two of them.\n These studies show that when groups focus exclusively on public\n\ninterest objectives, they tend to experience problems of organization,\n\naccess, and resource mobilization, and that these circumstances generally\n\nlead them to use some pressure strategies - such as publicity, confrontation,\n\nand litigation - rather than others, like consultation and co-operation.\n However, if we compare Berry's findings with research into material\n\nbenefit groups, we discover similar characteristics.\n Business interest associations are more likely to use consultation\n\nand co-operation rather than publicity and confrontation, but they may still\n\nuse the latter techniques.\n Organizational characteristics are more likely to be distinct.\n Business interest groups tend to be better developed organizationally\n\nand to have more extensive membership participation in policy-making than\n\npublic interest groups, while public interest groups are more likely to have\n\nbeen created by individuals whose charisma and entrepreneurial skills keep\n\nthem alive and draw media attention to their causes.\n Even on this dimension, however, it is possible to find public\n\ninterest groups that are more fully developed than many business groups and\n\nothers that encourage membership participation.  \n It is also possible to find business interest associations, such as\n\nthe Canadian Federation of Independent Business, that have been established\n\nby chiarismatic entrepreneurs.  \n We have to conclude, then, that we cannot create water-tight\n\ndivisions between groups by associating material benefit objectives with\n\none category of group and altruisic objectives with the others.", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'afe08b3c-44cf-4653-bf10-e387fe30119a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.772983+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': "The Canadian political system is shaped by a wide variety of\n\nconstitutional rules that go well beyond the provisions of our formal\n\nConstitution.\n While section 52 of the 1982 Constitution Act declares that some two\n\ndozen British and Canadian statutes and orders-in-council comprise our\n\nConstitution, and are the  'supreme law of Canada'  , Canadian\n\nconstitutional law also includes many other legal rules found in\n\nstatutes, orders-in-council, and judicial decisions relating to the\n\nexecutive, the judiciary, and the legislature.\n But even when they are added to the Constitution, we have only an\n\nincomplete and distorted view of our political system.\n is actually composed of three\n\nelements: the formal  Constitution  ; the legal rules relating to\n\nthe three branches of government; and, in addition, vitally important\n\ninformal rules, called conventions, that have arisen through political\n\npractice.  *   * In the discussions that follow I shall\n\nmaintain this distinction between the whole  constitution  ,\n\nand the subset of rules found in the entrenched documents of the \n\nConstitution  that are described in s. 52 and in the Schedule of the\n\nConstitution Act, 1982. \n As many areas of the constitution are structured by archaic or\n\nincomplete laws, the political arena has given birth to binding conventions\n\nand customary usages that not only direct political actors in these matters,\n\nbut ultimately determine the full substance and character of the\n\nCanadian constitution.\n of the Constitution is often\n\nremoulded by the force of conventions, which both complete the constitution\n\nand allow it to evolve with changes in prevailing values. \n\n  Every major aspect of the constitution depends on conventions.\n The sweeping legal powers of the Governor General are transferred by\n\nconvention to the Cabinet.\n The very basis of responsible government - with the requirements that\n\nboth individual ministers and the Cabinet collectively must account to\n\nthe legislature for the activities of the executive branch of government - is\n\na vital matter that has been entirely left out of the formal Constitution.\n Both the operation of disciplined parties, which give the basic\n\ncharacter to our legislatures, and the relationship between the House of\n\nCommons and the Senate, are similarly determined by convention.\n Many of the rules giving effect to the federal principle have arisen\n\nfrom political practice rather than from the formal division of powers,\n\nfound in the original Constitution Act of 1867 and in subsequent judicial\n\npronouncements.\n The basic independence of the judiciary has grown to a large extent\n\nout of informal rules as well as legal guarantees. \n\n  With the role conventions play in transforming the formal\n\nConstitution, it is crucial to have a full appreciation of the manner in\n\nwhich the legal and conventional rules of the constitution interact.\n Perhaps the greatest weakness of traditional examinations of the\n\nCanadian constitution is the over-simplification of both the character of\n\nconstitutional conventions and their relationship with the positive laws of\n\nthe constitution. \n\n  Two distinct and somewhat contradictory trends relating to\n\nconstitutional conventions appear to be at play in Canada.\n One tendency is to draw a clear boundary between law and convention.\n In its opinions on the 1981 reference questions about the amendment\n\nof the Constitution, the Supreme Court of Canada drew a sharp distinction\n\nbetween conventions, as political rules, and the legal rules enforced by the\n\ncourts.\n 'Constitutional\n\nconventions plus constitutional law equal the total [ c]onstitution of the\n\ncountry.'   \n Although this statement illustrates the importance of conventions, it\n\ndrastically oversimplifies the variety of rules that make up the\n\nconstitution, as well as how they interrelate. \n\n  The second major trend lies in an increasing propensity to seek\n\nthe legal regulation or judicial resolution of issues normally governed by\n\nconvention.\n The justiciability of conventions may become an increasingly impor\n\n<l> tant issue in Canadian constitutional theory.\n Peter Russell has noted that Canadian political culture has become\n\nmore litigious in recent decades, with legal solutions sought for political\n\ndisputes. \n In recent years a number of cases explicitly involving\n\nconstitutional conventions have come before Canadian courts for judicial\n\ndetermination. \n The inclination to seek a legal resolution of matters involving\n\nconventions was further exemplified after the 1985 general election in\n\nOntario.\n When the Liberals and the New Democratic Party announced they had\n\nreached an agreement ensuring that the NDP would support a Liberal government\n\nfor two years, Premier Frank Miller immediately sought legal advice about\n\nwhether this agreement could be challenged in the courts - even though it\n\nclearly related only to matters governed by convention.\n For his part, Lieutenant Governor John B. Aird consulted with a noted\n\nconstitutional lawyer, J.J. Robinette, about the avenues of action open to\n\nhim.\n Thus a trend seems to be developing where legal solutions are sought\n\nfor problems involving conventions. \n\n  The outcome of these two trends should be of great interest to\n\nstudents of the Canadian constitution.\n If conventional rules come to inhabit some legal dimension, there may\n\nbe significant consequences for the constitutional process.\n Any increased propensity to seek judicial remedies for matters\n\ninvolving conventions could further enhance the power of the judiciary to\n\nregulate the activities of elected officials.\n Some concern might be expressed at this prospect, since conventions\n\nhave always represented a valued method by which a constitution may evolve\n\ninformally through the actions of politicians who both respond and are\n\naccountable to the electorate.\n If conventions become increasingly justiciable, there is some danger\n\nthat the democratic quality of constitutional evolution might be eroded.\n On the other hand, too clear a boundary between court-enforceable\n\nconstitutional laws and conventional rules might see the courts enforcing\n\noutdated rules that not only lack any political legitimacy but may also be\n\ndestructive. \n\n\n  In the interests of clarity, a working definition of conventions\n\nis needed before proceeding further.\n What exactly is meant by a constitutional convention may be most\n\neasily explained by citing the formulation of Geoffrey Marshall and\n\nGraeme Moodie: \n By conventions of the constitution, we mean binding rules of\n\nconstitutional behaviour which are considered to be binding by and upon those\n\nwho operate the Constitution, but which are not enforced by the law courts (\n\nalthough the courts may recognise their existence), nor by the presiding\n\nofficers in the Houses of Parliament.   \n\n  Curiously few Canadian writers have ventured their own\n\ndefinitions of conventions.\n 'the acknowledged, binding,\n\nextra-legal customs, usages, practices and understandings by which our system\n\nof government operates.'  \n 'rules of the [\n\nc]onstitution that are not enforced by the law courts.'  \n Both of these definitions, however, fail to distinguish conventions\n\nfrom the  'laws and customs of Parliament'  , a distinction\n\ninsisted upon by most British authors. \n\n  Despite the importance of conventions to the Canadian\n\nconstitution, surprisingly little has been written on the subject by Canadian\n\nscholars.\n Canadian constitutional lawyers seldom seem to give much attention to\n\nthe topic, perhaps heeding A.V. Dicey's injunction of over a century ago that\n\nthe subject of conventions  'is not one of law but of politics, and\n\nneed trouble no lawyer or the class of any professor of law.'  \n A few constitutional lawyers have included interesting, if brief,\n\ndiscussions in their texts; Hogg  is perhaps\n\nthe best example among anglophone law teachers, while Henri Brun and Guy\n\nTremblay provide the superior coverage found in the French-Canadian\n\nliterature. \n Apart from these general discussions, particular constitutional\n\nconventions have occasionally been examined in greater detail: Paul\n\nGérin-Lajoie's work on constitutional amendment,  Frank Mackinnon's on the monarchy,  John\n\nT. Saywell's book on Lieutenant Governors,  and\n\nForsey's series of papers  on different aspects of\n\nparliamentary government are among the better-known examples.\n The Supreme Court's handling of the Patriation case prompted a\n\nreawakening of academic interest in conventions. \n The Quebec Veto case ( 1982) also prompted some speculation on\n\nthe nature of conventions in an article by Marc Gold. \n In general, however, much of the discussion in the Canadian\n\nliterature has focused over the years on the terms of particular conventions.\n Very little attention has been paid by Canadian scholars to the\n\nnature of conventions and how they may relate to other constitutional rules.\n\n\n\n  The most rigorous discussions of constitutional theory and the\n\nnature of conventions may be found in a number of works by British scholars.\n 17\n\n  remain the most prominent earlier authors, but quite a few\n\nBritish scholars have recently undertaken wide-ranging examinations of\n\nconventions. \n Geoffrey Marshall has given conventions the most comprehensive\n\ntreatment to date. \n The only other full-length book to examine constitutional conventions\n\nwas published in 1979 in Australia by L.J.M. Cooray.  \n\n  The distinction between law and convention is often implicitly\n\ntreated by constitutional writers as dating from A.V. Dicey's  An\n\nIntroduction to the Law of the Constitution  , first published in 1885.\n Certainly Dicey's examination of conventional rules was more\n\nthorough than any previous work and has come to be one of the leading texts\n\nin British constitutional theory.\n However, scholarly attention to the difference between the legal\n\nrules and the political practices and principles of the constitution predates\n\nDicey's work considerably.\n Hood Phillips has detailed the evolution of British constitutional\n\ntheory and the growing distinction made between law and political practice.\n\n\n The existence of these two types of rules was noted by Edmund Burke\n\nin the eighteenth century and was progressively expanded upon by later\n\nauthors.\n But Dicey laid much of the foundation of modern constitutional theory\n\nwhen he drew a fundamental distinction between  'the law of\n\nthe constitution', which, consisting ( as it does) of rules enforced or\n\nrecognised by the courts, makes up a body of 'law' in the proper sense of\n\nthat term, and the 'conventions of the constitution' , which, consisting ( as\n\nthey do) of customs, practices, maxims, or precepts which are not enforced or\n\nrecognised by the courts, make up a body not of laws, but of constitutional\n\nor political ethics ...   \n Dicey's clear separation of law and convention, on the grounds of\n\ncourt-enforceability, has been a pervasive element in theories of\n\nconstitutional law ever since. \n\n  There is a clear consensus among scholars since Dicey's time\n\nabout the general purposes that conventions serve.\n Their main function is to allow the exercise of legal powers in some\n\nmanner other than that prescribed by the letter of the law.\n ' ... they provide the flesh which\n\nclothes the dry bones of the law.'   \n Some conventions stipulate that the powers of a certain office be\n\nexercised only in certain circumstances; for example, the Governor General's\n\npower of dissolution is limited to a few situations.\n\n\ntively exercised in practice by someone else; thus much of the prerogative\n\npower of the Crown is determined exclusively by Cabinet rather than by the\n\nmonarch.\n Finally, a few conventions negate some existing legal power or duty;\n\nfor instance, a convention now releases the Governor General from the duty\n\nimposed in s.56 of the 1867 Constitution Act to send copies to the Queen of\n\nall federal legislation enacted into law.\n The primary benefit of these functions of conventions is that they\n\npermit the adaptation of constitutional rules to changes in the general\n\npolitical principles and values of the day, without the need for formal\n\namendment of existing positive law. \n\n  There is, however, some uncertainty over how conventions come to\n\nbe established and how they may be identified.\n Moreover, there is a fundamental division of opinion concerning\n\nthe legal character of conventions.\n The near dichotomy that Dicey drew is both hotly defended and\n\ncriticized. \n\n\n  Dicey set the battle-lines for a continuing debate on the nature\n\nof conventions in 1885, when he declared that conventions  'are\n\nnot in reality laws at all since they are not enforced by the Courts.' \n A good number of modern-day authorities continue to stress that a\n\ndistinction between legal rules and conventions based on court enforceability\n\nshould be maintained, especially because conventions primarily inhabit the\n\npolitical dimension. \n 'First and foremost, they are\n\npolitical: political in their birth, political in their growth and decay, and\n\npolitical in their applications and sanctions.'   \n Laws are enforced in the courts, while conventions are said to\n\nbe enforced in the political arena alone; this is the essence of the\n\ndistinction made between law and convention. \n\n  Some authors, however, have taken issue with the neatness of this\n\ndividing line.\n Jennings has been the most influential constitutional theorist\n\nto argue that conventions are not so easily separated from legal rules as the\n\njudicial-enforcement test implies.\n He has claimed that, in their substance, laws and conventions\n\nare often inextricably interrelated;  for example,\n\nlaws that refer to the prime minister or the government presuppose the\n\nconventions that create those offices. \n As a consequence, the courts have had to resort to conventions for\n\nguidance and interpretation in a number of cases involving constitutional\n\nissues.\n E.C.S. Wade has also echoed these points in his assertion that a\n\ndistinction based on judicial enforceability cannot consistently serve one in\n\ndiscussing the nature and functions of both law and convention. \n Although both authors willingly point out certain differences between\n\nlaw and convention, neither would accept Dicey's assertion that these rules\n\nare  'of a totally different character.'  \n\n  The main bone of contention between these two schools of thought\n\nis the role conventions may play in judicial proceedings.\n The debate focuses not only on the more empirical question of how\n\njudges have treated conventions, but also on the normative issue of how the\n\ncourts should treat them.", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '6af2a611-e35b-4e3d-b294-fbb5fa14643e', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.774221+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9641437530517578, 'non_english_score': 0.03585624694824219}
{'text': "The struggle over pay equity has affected most centrally the\n\ncapitalist workplace: the offices, factories, and mines where women and men\n\nare employed to earn a measure of subsistence so that others may profit by\n\ntheir labour.\n Changes in the capitalist labour process ( the way tools and equipment\n\nare combined with labour to produce commodities) have interacted with the way\n\nwages are divided up between women and men.\n This interaction occurs in three ways.\n 'equal pay\n\nfor work of equal value'  , employers and union bargaining agents are\n\nmandated to negotiate pay-equity plans in the capitalist workplace itself.\n These plans attempt to define more precisely the value of work and how\n\nit is divided up between women and men.\n Second, unions interpret pay-equity legislation as holding out the\n\npossibility of increasing their control over the labour process, while\n\nemployers regard such legislation as a threat to their control.\n Where unions have not existed in particular workplaces ( and this has\n\nbeen typical for women), pay-equity plans reaffirm managerial control over\n\nworkers by giving employers the right to unilaterally impose their own\n\ndesired form of pay equity, subject to the approval of state pay-equity\n\ncommissions or bureaus.\n Third, both unions and employers have contended that pay equity\n\nwould have long-reaching implications for the structure of work.\n The labour-feminist alliance has argued that pay equity would\n\nincrease the productivity of women by making them more satisfied with their\n\nlevel of monetary compensation; managers and employers have argued that equal\n\npay for work of equal value would lead to a restructuring of the labour\n\nprocess in the direction of more part-time work, more subcontracting of work,\n\nand faster replacement of intensive labour with labour-saving technology.\n It will be argued in this chapter that the labour-feminist affiance\n\nhas invited state intervention in the capitalist workplace primarily to\n\nredress women's lower wages, but in a form that would increase the control by\n\nwomen workers and unions over the labour process, while business has opposed\n\nstate intervention in the paid workplace for this very reason. \n\n\n  There are three main pay-equity models: complaint, employer-in\n\n<l> itiated or pro-active, and integrated.\n model, common in human-rights\n\nlegislation, women employees are entitled to file complaints alleging that\n\ntheir jobs are not being paid on a basis equal to similar or comparable male\n\njobs.\n This method exists in the 1978 Canadian Human Rights Act, the\n\nEmployment Standards Acts of Manitoba and Ontario, and the Quebec\n\nCharter of Human Rights and Freedoms enacted in 1975.\n model\n\nrequires the implementation of job-evaluation and pay-equity plans by the\n\nemployer in non-unionized establishments and jointly by employees and\n\nemployers through collective bargaining in unionized workplaces.\n This model is prominent in the legislation of Minnesota in the\n\nUS, the Manitoba Pay Equity Act of 1985 ( where disputes are referred to\n\narbitration or the labour board), and the 1988 Nova Scotia Pay Equity Act (\n\nwhich has no dispute-settlement mechanism).\n model provides for combinations of the\n\ncomplaint and pro-active models.\n This was the approach adopted in the 1986 Ontario Public Service Pay\n\nEquity Bill, the 1987 Ontario Pay Equity Act, and the 1988 Prince Edward\n\nIsland Pay Equity Act: the pro-active model is effective in an initial phase,\n\nwhen employers and employees are to negotiate a pay-equity plan; later,\n\ncomplaints could be lodged for failure to comply with the plan.\n Complaints may be made only about contraventions of the acts and are\n\nlimited to how the acts define pay equity, its implementation, restrictions,\n\nand exemptions.\n A fully-integrated act would not impose such restrictions on the\n\ncomplaints that could be lodged. \n Generally, business and the neo-conservatives, if they had to accept\n\nany type of equal-pay legislation, favoured the complaint model,  or one based on  'voluntary compliance'  , in\n\nwhich it was left up to employers to decide how best to equalize wages. \n Managers and personnel officers in the new middle class fell in line\n\nwith this position. \n The feminist-labour alliance, on the other hand, favoured the\n\npro-active model either by itself or in combination with the complaint\n\nprocedure in the integration model.\n The Equal Pay Coalition of Ontario came up with a relatively\n\ninnovative plan: the pro-active setting-up of pay-equity plans was to apply\n\nonly to unionized workplaces and workplaces with 100 employees or more;\n\nworkplaces with fewer than 100 employees and unorganized workplaces would\n\nonly have to follow the complaint model.  \n\n\n  In several national, Canadian provincial, and US state jurisdic\n\n<l> tions there are three issues variously at stake regarding the coverage of\n\nwomen by pay-equity legislation:  gender predominance  , ( should\n\njob comparisons be made between female-dominated and male-dominated jobs, or\n\nbetween all jobs, regardless of their gender composition?); \n\nestablishment  ( should job comparisons be made only within a single\n\nestablishment of the same employer, or between establishments of the same and\n\n/ or different employers?); and  sector  ( should the legislation\n\napply only to the public sector, or a subpart of that sector, or to the\n\nprivate sector as well?).\n Business has wanted to exclude as many women as possible from\n\ncoverage, while feminist and trade-union organizations have wanted the\n\nbroadest possible coverage.\n\n\n\n  In pro-active and integrated pay-equity legislation, gender\n\npredominance is usually specified, so that the law covers only  'women's\n\npositions'  , or those occupied mainly by women.\n The 1985 Manitoba Pay Equity Act applies only to those jobs in the\n\npublic sector in which 70 per cent or more are women; comparisons can be\n\nmade only with those jobs in which 70 per cent or more of the occupants are\n\nmen.\n These levels can be changed through negotiations between employers\n\nand employees. \n The 1988 Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island Pay Equity Acts define\n\nboth female and male predominance at the 60 per cent level. \n it was suggested\n\nthat pay-equity adjustments could be carried out only by comparing\n\nfemale-predominant with male-predominant jobs, but the question of\n\ndetermining gender predominance was left open.\n A number of methods from other jurisdictions were discussed: a\n\nsliding scale of 55 to 70 per cent, based on the number of employees per\n\nestablishment, proposed by the Canadian Human Rights Commission; a\n\nstatistical formula proposed by a comparable-worth commission in New\n\nYork State; consideration of historical patterns, especially in those\n\noccupations that were once female-predominant and consequently still receive\n\nlow pay; or the arbitrary 70 per cent cut-off figure plus the possibility of\n\nnegotiating other levels, as in the Manitoba legislation. \n The Ontario Public Service Pay Equity bill and the 1987 Ontario Pay\n\nEquity Act provide for a 70 per cent cut-off for predominantly male jobs and\n\na 60 per cent cut-off for predominantly female jobs unless these levels are\n\nchanged through negotiation between employers and employees. \n In many complaint-based human-rights and employment-standards\n\nacts, gender predominance is not formally defined or acknowledged. \n\n\nCHRC  ) Task Force recognized the issue of gender predominance in\n\nthe case of group complaints. \n accepted a\n\nsliding scale based on the number of employees in an occupational group to\n\ndetermine gender predominance. \n The cut-offs were as follows: fewer than 100 employees, 70 per cent;\n\n100 to 500, 60 per cent; and more than 500, 55 per cent. \n In smaller occupational groups, because the cut-off is higher, there\n\nis a greater chance that women will not qualify for equal-pay adjustments.\n Regardless of group size, the Canadian Human Rights Act applies to\n\nall persons in each occupation.\n It does not have the minimum-of-ten threshold found in the 1985\n\nManitoba and 1988 Nova Scotia Acts. \n\n\n  Business interests have either rejected any definition of gender\n\npredominance or wanted the cut-off to be set as high as possible and made\n\ninflexible, so that very few women qualify for pay-equity adjustments.\n In Canada in 1986 the Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association\n\nopposed defining gender predominance in any way. \n The Ontario Chamber of Commerce thought that the 60 per cent to 70\n\nper cent contemplated by the government was too low, and wanted the levels\n\nfor both male- and female-predominant jobs established at between 80 and 90\n\nper cent. \n Other business associations wanted a level higher than the 60 to\n\n70 per cent range without specifying exact percentages. \n Such employer groups as the Ontario Mining Association, Ontario\n\nHydro, the Municipal Electric Association, and the Canadian  Association took the less extreme position of\n\nfavouring the 70 per cent cut-off level. \n The Board of Trade of Metropolitan Toronto wanted to have a phase-in\n\nperiod for gender predominance: during the first year of pay equity, the\n\nthreshold for male- and female-predominant jobs would be set at 90 per cent,\n\nto fall 5 per cent in each subsequent year until it reached a 70 per cent\n\nplateau.\n To avoid the uncertain effects of fluctuations in the thresholds, it\n\nrecommended a three-year stabilization period before a level could be\n\nestablished, and wanted a ban on any negotiations between unions and\n\nmanagement to reduce the figure below 70 per cent. \n The Day Care Advisory Committee of Metropolitan Toronto, which on\n\nother issues leaned more towards the business position than the feminist one,\n\nfavoured a 50 per cent threshold for female predominance on the grounds that\n\nwomen's participation rate in the labour force would soon reach this\n\nlevel. \n Association also wanted the 70 per cent\n\nfigure, which it favoured, to be non-negotiable and applicable to groups of\n\nno less than 10 employees, with  'group'  defined as  'occupation\n\n<l> al type rather than evaluated grade level'  , and a three-year\n\nstabilization period.  \n\n\n  In the Ontario and Manitoba debates, the feminist-labour alliance\n\nmounted seven responses to the neo-conservative business approach to\n\ngender predominance. \n\n  .\n As one option, many in the feminist-labour alliance rejected\n\ncompletely any automatic numerical cut-off figure, whether applied to female-\n\nor male-predominant jobs. \n The Ontario Equal Pay Coalition stated its objection\n\ngraphically:   'A fixed percentage could work like a guillotine and\n\nautomatically exclude large numbers of women who deserve the right to file a\n\ncomplaint.'   \n The National Action Committee on the Status of Women warned that\n\nautomatic cut-off figures for gender predominance would give employers\n\ngrounds to launch court appeals under the Canadian Charter of Human Rights\n\nand Freedoms, resulting in years of delays in implementing pay equity. \n 'any\n\nthreshold level that restricts the initiation of a complaint is a direct\n\nviolation of Section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'\n\n .  \n\n  .\n As another option, several feminist and labour organizations\n\nsuggested lower numerical figures than 70 per cent in the determination of\n\ngender predominance.\n The Charter of Rights Coalition in Manitoba and the Manitoba\n\nAssociation of Woman and the Law suggested a 60 per cent figure for both\n\nfemale- and male-dominated jobs. \n Organized Working Women, and Ontario Equal Pay Coalition, the Ontario\n\nCoalition for Better Daycare, and the Federal of Women \n\nAssociation of Ontario suggested that, since women make up 44 per cent of the\n\nlabour force, gender the predominance should be set at a level just above\n\nthis figure.  \n\n  .\n Trade unions and feminist groups wanted as much flexibility as\n\npossible in the determination of gender predominance. \n In particular, they said, sex stereotypes and the historical patterns\n\nof gender predominance should be taken into account. \n For example, some low-paying occupations that are now dominated by\n\nmen were once dominated by women, and this historical pattern has influenced\n\ncurrent wages. \n Women in such occupations should be able to qualify for the\n\npay-equity adjustments despite the fact that they are not in\n\nfemale-predominant jobs. \n The Ontario Equal Pay Coalition suggested a dual approach to gender\n\npredominance: in the pro-active setting-up of pay-equity plans, use a\n\nflexible approach that takes into account historical patterns and sex\n\nstereotyping of some occupations; in the complaint procedure, abandon\n\nthe notion of gender predominance completely.  \n\n  .\n Trade unions more than feminist organizations pushed for the\n\ndetermination of gender predominance through collective bargaining rather\n\nthan unilaterally, by management fiat. \n Although many feminist organizations accepted collective\n\nbargaining as a means to achieve pay equity, some were suspicious of male\n\ndomination in negotiations, resulting in the dropping of  'women's\n\nissues'  ( such as child care or affirmative action) from packages\n\npresented to employers in favour of general wage and benefits increases\n\ndesired by male majorities in many unions.", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'c2c27295-608f-4d96-a7f6-1e3221bf7f98', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.775672+00:00',

{'text': 'The number of elderly people in our society is increasing.\n This is, of course, a result of population growth.\n The proportion of our population that is elderly is also increasing,\n\nboth because of declines in the birth rate and because of increased life\n\nexpectancy.\n Demographers do not agree on the exact details of the shifts in the\n\nage composition of our population and disagree even more strongly regarding\n\nwhen and if the current trends will abate.\n However, no matter which demographic calculations are used it is clear\n\nthat, at least for the next 50 years, the proportion of elderly individuals\n\nin our society will be increasing ( Chappell, Strain, and Blandford). \n\n  These demographic projections have given rise to a variety of dire\n\npredictions.\n It has been suggested that, as a result of longer life expectancy and\n\ndramatic improvement in life-extending technologies, elderly people of the\n\nfuture will experience longer periods of infirmity before death than today\'s\n\nelderly people ( Gruenberg; Simmons-Tropea and Osborn).\n The suggestion that the price we will pay for longer life\n\nexpectancy is a longer period of infirmity before death strikes dread to most\n\nhearts.\n The constellation of loss of independence, being a burden on others,\n\nand pain or suffering for an extended period seems a high price for a few\n\nextra years of life.\n Indeed, the greatest fear of elderly people is not death or\n\npoverty or loneliness, but incapacity ( Harris). \n\n  Also derived from demographic projections is the suggestion that\n\nhealth care costs will sky-rocket because resources are disproportionately\n\nexpended for care of chronically ill elderly people ( Schulz).\n In addition, because both increased health care and pension costs\n\nwill have to be borne by a proportionately smaller number of workers,\n\nthe financial burden of the elderly population will contribute to\n\nintergenerational conflict over expenditure of available resources (\n\nNeugarten; Tindale and Marshall).\n Indeed, Callahan ( 1986) has argued that we will approach the point\n\nwhere the only sensible decision on the societal level will be to terminate\n\nexpensive health care practices for elderly individuals in favour of\n\ndirecting virtually all health care resources to younger more productive ( or\n\npotentially productive) individuals.\n Debates on the ethics of such a position have already begun (\n\nSummerville). \n An Alternative View: The Compression of Morbidity Hypothesis\n\n \n\n  Some experts take issue with the bleak scenario of longer periods\n\nof infirmity occurring as average life expectancy increases and propose a\n\nvery different view ( Fries; Maddox).\n Most controversial among these is James Fries, who, in a 1981 book,\n\n Vitality and Aging  ( with Lawrence Crapo), proposed that as more\n\npeople live to old age they can live  less  of their old age with a\n\nserious infirmity.\n " compression of morbidity"\n\n hypothesis.\n ( " " Morbidity" " refers to the presence of\n\ndisease, " " infirmity" " to the debilitating effects of\n\ndisease.\n In writing about his hypothesis, Fries uses the terms morbidity,\n\ninfirmity, and disease interchangeably, and in this respect we have followed\n\nhis lead.) \n\n  The compression of morbidity hypothesis is stated in terms of two\n\npremises: that the maximum human life span is fixed at about 115 years and\n\nthat with increased use of techniques of prevention and intervention the age\n\nat which infirmity first occurs will increase.\n Taken together these two premises lead to the conclusion that the\n\n duration  of infirmity will decrease.\n Although the basic idea has been around for some time ( Pearl), Fries\n\nis currently its most ardent and articulate proponent.\n If the compression of morbidity hypothesis is correct, its\n\nimplications are far-reaching, both to individuals and to society.\n In this paper we will elaborate the hypothesis, evaluate criticisms\n\nof it, and discuss the implications both of accepting and rejecting it.\n\n\n\n  This premise has two components, one specifying that the maximum\n\nlife span is fixed and the other specifying the particular age at which it is\n\nfixed.\n These two components differ both in terms of their contentiousness\n\nand in terms of the availability of supporting evidence. \n\n  Before proceeding, it is helpful to differentiate among average\n\nlife expectancy ( the statistically determined age to which an\n\nindividual born at a particular time, in a particular place, is likely to\n\nlive), normal life span ( the age to which the average human would live if\n\nenvironmental conditions were optimal), and maximum life span ( the\n\nmaximum age to which an individual human being living under optimal\n\nenvironmental conditions could possibly live).\n At the present time, average life expectancy in the developed\n\ncountries is approaching 80 years for women and is only 5 - 7 years less for\n\nmen ( Myers and Manton).\n According to Fries the normal human life span is about 85 years and\n\nthe maximum human life span is about 115 years. \n\n  Inherent in the concepts of a normal and a fixed maximum life\n\nspan is the notion that there is such a thing as a normal process of aging.\n Although not taking a strong position regarding the specifics, Fries\n\nholds that such a process is probably genetically controlled and determines\n\nthat as we age: 1) the capacity of each of the body\'s organs to function\n\ndeclines; 2) because the body is composed of multiple organ systems, each of\n\nwhich is declining, there is an exponentially increasing probability that one\n\nof the systems will fail; 3) because the homeostatic processes of the body\n\nare very finely tuned and easily disrupted, as organ systems deteriorate, the\n\nability of the body to recover from disruption lessens.\n Thus, in old age, as a result of the normal process of aging and in\n\nthe absence of pathology, the stage is set for death to occur reasonably\n\nquickly, as a result of what would have been a minor disruption earlier in\n\nlife - for example, pneumonia, a minor infection, or a drug interaction\n\neffect.\n From this perspective the normal process of aging will lead to\n\ndeath if some pathological process does not do so first. \n\n  Most experts in the area of biological gerontology hold either\n\nthat the body\'s cells and/or organs break down from regular use ( i.e., in\n\nthe absence of pathology), or that there are intrinsic genetic factors which\n\nregulate, somehow, such breakdowns ( Sacher).\n Despite much debate on the precise nature of the process controlling\n\nnormal aging, there is widespread agreement that such a process exists\n\nand defines some upper limit on the human life span ( Perlmutter and Hall).\n This is consistent with the fact that all other species seem to have\n\na fixed maximum life span.\n The majority position has not, however, gone unchallenged.\n Because the biological changes that occur with increasing age involve\n\ndecline and deterioration, it is extremely difficult to determine whether\n\nparticular declines are the result of pathological processes or of\n\nintrinsic factors.\n Indeed, some argue that there may be no such thing as normal aging,\n\nthat all changes are the result of pathology ( Walford).\n It follows from such a position that if the lethal chronic diseases\n\nafflicting humans could be eliminated, life could continue indefinitely. \n\n  Although most biological gerontologists agree that there are\n\nnormal processes of aging and that a fixed maximum life span must\n\nfollow, there is substantially less agreement about what this maximum might\n\nbe ( Simmons-Tropea and Osborn).\n Many do not see the question as particularly urgent or important.\n It is, however, a point crucial to Fries\'s position.\n For Fries to argue that compression of morbidity can be achieved in a\n\nforeseeable time frame requires that maximum life span be not very far from\n\nthe currently documented maximum age of about 115 years.\n As he notes, although the proportion of individuals living to close\n\nto this apparent maximum has steadily increased from 1900 to 1980, there is\n\nno evidence to indicate that the maximum itself has shifted during this\n\nperiod.  1   1 Some have mistakenly concluded that the\n\nincrease in average life expectancy since 1900 ( 47 years in Canada in 1900\n\nto 75 in 1981) may be taken as evidence either that there is no upper limit\n\nto the increase in average life expectancy ( i.e., no fixed maximum life\n\nspan) or that the maximum human life span is greater than that which has been\n\nobserved to date.\n However, the increase in average life expectancy in this century\n\nin the developed countries is the result of reduction in infant\n\nmortality, the virtual elimination of death from acute infectious diseases,\n\nand increased attention to occupational safety.\n This increase in average life expectancy cannot be taken as relevant\n\nto determination of the maximum human life span \n The fact that average life expectancy has increased but maximum life\n\nspan has not is reflected in the increasing  " rectangularization"\n\n of survival curves ( the percentage of individuals surviving to a\n\ngiven age in a given year) that has occurred during this century.\n diagram\n\n \n\n  Among the additional arguments Fries cites in favour of the fixed\n\nmaximum human life span being about 115 years are: that despite many\n\nclaims to extremely long life, the oldest individual whose age was documented\n\n( up to 1981 when the Fries and Crapo book was published) was a Canadian who\n\ndied at age 113 years, 124 days; that maximum life span for mammalian species\n\nmay be predicted by brain size / body weight ratio; and that there has been\n\nno evidence of change in the maximum human life span over the past 100,000\n\nyears.\n Let us turn now to examine the second premise of Fries\'s position.\n\n\n\n\n  A model developed by the scientific advisory group of the World\n\nHealth Organization ( WHO) is useful in conceptualizing the relationship\n\nbetween health and longevity.\n This model distinguishes among morbidity-free life expectancy,\n\ndisability-free life expectancy, and total life expectancy.\n In the typical case there is some period of time between onset of\n\nmorbidity and onset of disability, and between onset of disability and death.\n The length of these two periods varies as a function of age of onset\n\nof morbidity and cause of morbidity.\n Thus, in the case of relatively rapidly-lethal diseases ( e.g.,\n\ncoronary heart disease, stroke, cancer) both the periods of disability-free\n\nmorbidity and of disability preceding death tend to be relatively short (\n\nperhaps only two or three years each), whereas for degenerative diseases (\n\ne.g., osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, senile dementia) each period can be\n\nmuch longer ( perhaps as long as 15 years).\n For different causes of morbidity the length of time in each\n\nperiod will differ somewhat as a function of age of onset of morbidity. \n\n  The current thinking is that as average life expectancy converges\n\non normal life expectancy for the species more individuals are likely to\n\ndevelop at least one chronic disease ( e.g., coronary heart disease,\n\natherosclerosis, respiratory disease, cancer, osteoporosis, senile dementia,\n\ndiabetes, etc.) that progresses to the point that he or she will experience a\n\nlong period of increasing incapacity ( Schneider and Brody; Simmons-Tropea\n\nand Osborn).\n Fries argues, however, that it is possible to postpone the onset of\n\nthe common chronic diseases by a variety of measures, mostly preventive and\n\nmostly involving aspects of life-style such as weight control, nutrition,\n\nexercise, stress management, elimination of smoking, control of salt intake,\n\nmoderation in consumption of alcohol, etc.\n Timely and appropriate application of such measures would allow\n\nmost individuals to remain vital into old age and postpone the onset of\n\nchronic disease, so that most would die as a result of the normal process of\n\naging before becoming seriously incapacitated by a chronic disease. \n\n\n  Fries\'s compression of morbidity hypothesis has attracted an\n\nenormous amount of attention and controversy.\n There have been countless scholarly and not so scholarly articles\n\ncriticizing, supporting, or otherwise commenting on his formulation.\n Among gerontologists few issues have generated as much controversy in\n\nthe past 20 or 30 years.\n The responses have been varied.\n Some have seemed motivated by an intensely personal, emotion-laden\n\ndesire to believe that the life span is not finite or at least that it is\n\nlonger than Fries\'s 115 years.\n Such a desire may be fuelled by fears of death, wishes for\n\nimmortality, or other aspects of individual psychodynamics.\n Most responses, however, have been of one of two sorts: criticisms of\n\nFries\'s interpretation of the data presented to support the compression\n\nof morbidity hypothesis, or warnings regarding the implications of accepting\n\nthe compression of morbidity hypothesis.\n\n\n  Criticism of the compression of morbidity hypothesis is directed\n\neither to the premise of a fixed maximum life span of about 115 years or to\n\nthe possibility of delaying the onset of chronic disease.\n Given the reasonably compelling evidence across species that the\n\nmaximum life span is fixed and that in humans it is in the vicinity of 115\n\nyears, we find it surprising that most criticism focuses on whether the\n\nmaximum life span is 115 years, rather than the seemingly more problematic\n\nsuggestion that prevention programmes can succeed in altering life-styles\n\n to the degree  necessary to significantly delay the onset of\n\nchronic disease.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '87d0bb4e-7e9e-4258-925e-93836951642f', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.776904+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9529977440834045, 'non_english_score': 0.04700225591659546}
{'text': "Across the northern half of North America, there are two natural\n\nregions - the Arctic and the Subarctic.\n Climate has played a key role in forming these two biomes.\n The arctic climate, for instance, is associated with a particular type\n\nof natural vegetation, soils, and biological life.\n All these natural features are interrelated.\n Their natural vegetation provides the most visible spatial pattern (\n\nFigure 2.1).\n These same natural regions form the cultural homelands of the Inuit\n\nand Indian peoples. \n\n  The common denominator found in both regions, but particularly in\n\nthe Arctic, is the presence of a cold environment, which results in slow\n\ngrowth of biological life, natural vegetation, and soil formation.\n Because of the polar climate, the presence of permafrost, cold ocean\n\nbodies, and the chilling effect of the Labrador current, only the continental\n\nareas of the Subarctic experience warm weather for any length of time.\n Besides being a cold environment, most of the North receives so\n\nlittle precipitation that it is termed a cold desert.\n These two factors, low temperatures and low precipitation, make the\n\nNorth among the least productive biological areas of the world ( Figure 2.2).\n At the same time, such a slow rate of plant and biological life means\n\nthat the natural environment is slow to recover from natural or anthropogenic\n\ndamage.\n The fragile nature of the polar environments is indicated by the\n\nrelationship of temperature and precipitation to plant growth ( Figure 2.2)\n\n    . \n\n  The Arctic has the coldest environment in Canada.\n It lies north of the treeline, found primarily in the Northwest\n\nTerritories but also in Quebec, Newfoundland, Ontario, Yukon, and Manitoba.\n It is characterized by a very cold climate where the warmest month\n\nhas a mean monthly temperature of less than 10&degree;C.\n Under such climatic conditions, normal tree growth is not possible\n\nand a tundra vegetation is formed.\n True zonal soils are not found in the Arctic.\n In many places, rock and unconsolidated gravels and sands form the\n\nground surface.\n Where thin soils have formed in the continuous permafrost zone, they\n\nare often classified as cryosols ( soils which have an active or thawed layer\n\nof less than one metre in depth).\n Under these conditions, soil-forming processes work extremely slowly\n\nbecause soil temperatures are often just above the freezing point.\n Even when summer air temperatures thaw the top few centimetres of the\n\nground, the presence of permafrost beneath this thin active layer acts not\n\nonly as a cooling agent but also as a barrier to water. \n\n  Arctic vegetation is often divided into two zones - Low Arctic\n\nand High Arctic.\n The Low Arctic occupies the mainland while the High Arctic is found\n\nin parts of Keewatin and the Arctic Archipelago.\n The Low Arctic zone is characterized by nearly complete plant cover,\n\nincluding many shrubs, sedges, and scrub trees such as birch and willow.\n Tussock sedge and low tundra shrubs are the summer grazing of barren\n\nground caribou, which are still a major source of food for Native people.\n Heath, herbs, and lichen are the typical plants.\n While trees such as willows do grow, they reach a height of only a\n\nfew centimetres. \n\n  In the High Arctic zone, freezing temperatures occur almost daily\n\nand permafrost is present near the surface throughout the year so that even\n\ntundra vegetation growth is inhibited.\n Periglacial features - bare rock and a variety of unconsolidated\n\nmaterials - are commonly found.\n Such barren arctic lowlands are called polar deserts ( Vignette 2.1).\n\n \n\n\n  usually describes\n\nbarren areas of bare rock, shattered bedrock, and sterile gravel.\n These conditions are essentially an extreme form of fell field, with\n\nvegetation cover, at least of higher plants, reduced to near zero.\n Actually, this initial impression of barrenness is usually\n\ninaccurate.\n It is hard to find a square metre of polar desert that has no form\n\nof vegetation growing on it.\n\n\n  ) are the foot\n\nsoldiers or unsung heroes of the tundra environment.\n Lichens are in a sense a group of primitive plants, although it is\n\nmore correct to think of them as a colony or association of two kinds of\n\nplants living together.\n The main body of a lichen is called a thallus; it consists of a\n\ndense, tangled mass of threadlike fungal material.\n This fungal matrix varies greatly in shape from one kind of lichen\n\nto another, but each kind has a characteristic form by which it can usually\n\nbe identified.\n Encapsulated with the fungal strands are quantities of single-celled\n\nalgae.\n\n\n \n\n  The treeline often serves as the boundary between the Arctic and\n\nthe Subarctic.\n ` break'\n\n between the two regions, though in fact the  'break' \n\nis a gradual one consisting of a wooded tundra ( Vignette 2.2). \n\n\n  The treeline represents a dividing zone between the Arctic and\n\nSubarctic regions.\n It closely corresponds to the 10&degree;C monthly mean temperature\n\nfor July.\n Other natural factors, such as the depth of the active layer of\n\npermafrost, protection from wind, south slope radiation, and well drained\n\nland, may result in patches of trees growing north of this isotherm, or\n\nconversely, tundra occurring south of it.\n Then too, weather varies from year to year, causing the annual\n\nposition of the isotherm to fluctuate somewhat.\n During the relatively warm decade of the 1980s, for instance, summer\n\ntemperatures were much higher in high latitudes than in most previous\n\ndecades.\n All of these factors have produced a transition zone of wooded\n\ntundra between the Arctic and Subarctic regions. \n\n  Three centres close to this imaginary line are Aklavik (\n\n68&degree;12'N), Churchill ( 58&degree;48'N), and Cartwright (\n\n53&degree;36'N).\n Aklavik, located on a deltaic island at the mouth of the Mackenzie\n\nRiver, has a warmest-month average mean temperature of 14&degree;C;\n\nChurchill, situated near the shore of Hudson Bay, has an average July\n\ntemperature of 11.8&degree;C; and Cartwright, lying along the Labrador Coast,\n\nhas a mean July figure of 12&degree;.\n About 250 km inland from the coast, temperatures are much higher\n\nand, at Happy Valley-Goose Bay, the mean July temperature is 15.8&degree;.\n The continental effect of this large land mass coupled with the\n\nsummer cooling caused by the ocean waters of Hudson Bay have resulted in a\n\nnorth-west to south-east trend to the 'treeline'.  \n The proportion of tundra to forest varies but, toward the Arctic\n\nzone, only a few stunted trees are found in the more protected areas of river\n\nvalleys.\n Spruce and larch are the predominant species found in the wooded\n\ntundra.\n This transition zone also represents a biological and cultural\n\nboundary.\n Many subarctic animals, including the beaver and moose, are not found\n\nin the Arctic and of the aboriginal peoples only the Inuit developed the\n\ntechnology permitting year-round life in the Arctic. \n\n  The Subarctic, the largest natural region in North America, is\n\ncovered by the boreal forest in a continuous belt from Newfoundland to the\n\nRocky Mountains.\n Its summers are short but warm, allowing for a much richer vegetation\n\ncover than that found in the Arctic.\n Coniferous trees predominate.\n Variation in this forest allows for the identification of four\n\nsubzones: wooded tundra, lichen woodland, closed boreal forest, and forest\n\npark-land.\n The wooded tundra forms the transition zone beyond which lies the\n\ntundra.\n Patches of spruce and larch are found in sheltered, low-lying areas\n\nwhile high, more exposed lands are treeless.\n The lichen woodland is a savannah-like area consisting of a thick\n\ngroundcover of lichens interspersed with stands of spruce and pine.\n The closed boreal forest, a dense forest of fir, spruce, and pine, is\n\nfound in southern Yukon, a small part of the Northwest Territories (\n\nprincipally the upper Mackenzie Valley), and the seven provinces.\n Within this zone, the forest cover, is broken by a variety of\n\nwetlands including muskeg and peat bogs.\n In this wet environment, black spruce and larch are the most common\n\nspecies.\n On the better drained land, species of spruce, fir, pine, and larch\n\nare common along with stands of poplar and birch.\n Towards its southern limits, broad-leaf trees, particularly aspen and\n\nbirch, are found.\n The forest parkland, a narrow transition area adjacent to the\n\nCanadian Prairies, is a combination of forest and mid-latitude\n\ngrasslands.\n Small bushes, including blueberries, and grasses form the floor\n\ncover. \n\n  Infertile podzolic soils are common in the Subarctic.\n These thin, acidic soils are best formed under cool, wet growing\n\nconditions where the principal vegetative litter is derived from a\n\nconiferous forest.\n A low evaporation rate, immature drainage, and permafrost ensure an\n\nexcess of ground moisture, resulting in severely leached soils and the\n\nwidespread occurrence of marsh and bogs.\n In spite of these environmental handicaps, soil formation is much\n\nmore active in the Subarctic than it is in the Arctic.\n One reason is that the longer summer temperatures allow the ground to\n\nthaw to a depth of several metres, promoting biological activity and chemical\n\naction.\n Another is that the vegetation cover is much denser in the Subarctic\n\nthan in the Arctic, thus providing much more plant litter for soil formation.\n\n\n\n  Subarctic lakes and forests provide an attractive environment for\n\nmany animals and wildfowl.\n Unlike animals in the Arctic, wildlife in the Subarctic often\n\nhibernates during the winter months.\n Within this forested biome, a wide variety of animals make their\n\nhome, including the beaver, moose, and grouse.\n The abundance of lakes, marsh, and muskeg provides a favourable\n\nhabitat for many waterfowl and big game animals such as moose which graze on\n\nshoreline vegetation.\n In the winter, caribou herds migrate from the Arctic into the\n\nnorthern forest. \n\n\n  The cold nature of the North has shaped the vegetation, soils,\n\nand biological life found in Arctic and Subarctic.\n This cold environment - the polar climate - results primarily from\n\nlow receipts of solar energy.\n It is this limited solar energy entering the northern hemisphere\n\nwhich creates the two types of polar climate: the arctic and the subarctic.\n\n\n\n  Polar climates lie in high latitudes.\n They are characterized by low levels of solar energy and\n\nprecipitation.\n On average, the earth's poles receive 40% less radiation than the\n\nequator ( Lawford 1988: 144).\n At the Arctic Circle, solar radiation is reduced to zero for one day\n\nand, at higher latitudes, for longer periods of times, reaching six months at\n\nthe North Pole.\n Such low levels of radiation result in continuous cooling of the land\n\nand the build-up of masses of frigid arctic air which are associated with\n\ndaily high temperatures of - 40&degree;C or lower.\n These frigid arctic air masses often surge southwards, causing\n\nblizzard conditions in the Canadian Prairies, subzero temperatures in\n\neastern Canada and freezing temperatures in the southern United States.\n In the spring, solar radiation increases but, because of the\n\nreflective snow-cover, much of its effect is lost, with up to 80% of the\n\nsolar radiation being reflected.\n Until the snow cover melts, the breaking of winter's grip is slowed.\n Once the snow is gone, temperatures recover rapidly and the ensuing\n\nwarm weather quickly melts the ice from lakes, rivers, and the sea coast.\n By early July, sea ice has disappeared from Hudson Bay and, a few\n\nweeks later, from along the edge of the arctic sea coast.\n Polar Pack Ice, of course, continues to occupy most of the Arctic\n\nOcean.\n During the short summer, massive amounts of solar radiation reach\n\nthe northern lands and waters.\n With long daylight hours, the landscape warms and plants quickly\n\nappear and flower.\n Daily summer temperatures in the Mackenzie Valley and southern Yukon\n\ncan reach into the low 30&degree;C.\n By September, however, cooling begins and winter soon regains its\n\ngrip on the polar lands and waters. \n\n  The seasonal pattern of air temperatures is illustrated in\n\nFigure 2.3.\n The winter regime is shown by the mean daily temperature for\n\nJanuary, demonstrating its cold continental nature.\n The coldest January temperatures are found in two places - the\n\nnorth end of Ellesmere and Axel Heiberg islands and just south of Boothia\n\nPeninsula.\n On the other hand, the mean daily temperature for July demonstrates\n\nboth the warming effect of the northern land mass and the cooling effect of\n\nthe Arctic Ocean ( both open water and permanent ice pack), Hudson Bay, and\n\nthe Labrador Current.\n There is a marked northwest to southeast trend in the July isotherms\n\nwith a warm 'corridor' extending down the Mackenzie Valley. \n\n  Precipitation in the North is generally light with the least\n\namount falling in the Arctic ( Figure 2.4).\n The main reasons are the inability of cold air to absorb moisture\n\nand the existence of ice on northern lakes, Hudson Bay, and the Arctic Ocean\n\nfor much of the year.\n For these reasons, it is not surprising that the lowest annual\n\nprecipitation occurs in the ice-locked islands situated in the Arctic\n\nArchipelago.\n Victoria Island, for example, has such scant rain and snowfall (\n\noften less than 140 mm annually) that it is described as an 'arctic desert'.\n Resolute Bay, which is located just 16&degree; south of the North\n\nPole, receives less than 140 mm per year.  \n Further south, at the northern edge of the Subarctic, precipitation\n\nis heavier.\n At Yellowknife, the annual precipitation is around 250 mm.\n The Subarctic, on the other hand, generally receives more\n\nprecipitation, usually over 300 mm annually.\n Precipitation does vary, however.\n A few areas do receive much greater precipitation.\n The greatest amount of precipitation occurs in the Cordillera and\n\nalong the Atlantic coast.\n In these two areas, the high terrain results in orographic\n\nprecipitation ( rain or snow caused when warm, moisture-laden air is forced\n\nto rise over hills or mountains and is cooled in the process).\n The south coast of Baffin Island receives around 400 mm annually\n\nwhile the figures for the southern coast of Labrador and the mid-North of\n\nQuebec exceed 800 mm.\n Most precipitation falls as snow.\n In the spring, rivers and streams are swollen by melting snow and\n\nice.\n Some communities along the Mackenizie River are subject to spring\n\nflooding.\n Fort Simpson, situated on an island at the confluence of the Liard\n\nand Mackenzie Rivers, has been inundated a number of times, and Aklavik,\n\nlocated in the delta of the Mackenzie River, is threatened by spring flood\n\nwaters almost every year.  \n The occurrence of spring flooding at Aklavik is so regular that, in\n\nthe late 1950s, the federal government decided to create the new town of\n\nInuvik rather than expand the community of Aklavik. \n\n  In addition to the Arctic and Subarctic climatic types, most\n\nclimatic maps also depict a Cordillera climate, a composite of several\n\nclimates.\n In this text, the mountainous area of northern British Columbia,\n\nYukon, and Northwest Territories is

{'text': 'Americans may best remember 1973 for the night their president\n\nappeared on television to accept responsibility for the Watergate scandal.\n Canadians may recall it as the year world oil prices quadrupled in\n\nresponse to declining production by members of the OPEC cartel.\n Still others may recollect it most vividly for the event that\n\nprecipitated that embargo, the outbreak of war in the Middle East.\n In time, though, much of the world may come to remember it best for\n\ntwo relatively uncelebrated men, Herbert Boyer and Stanley Cohen, and a\n\nnameless grey toad.\n That year, in a relatively short and characteristically undramatic\n\narticle in the scientific press, the California researchers described an\n\nexperiment in which they had stitched together a DNA molecule from parts of\n\ntwo distinct species - a toad and a bacterium - and inserted it into a\n\nliving bacterial cell.\n Though hardly a classic scene of impending revolution, their\n\nexperiment marked the beginning of a fundamental shift in humanity\'s\n\nrelationship to the organic world.\n Boyer and Cohen had become the first people to engineer an entirely\n\nnovel form of life. \n\n  Though the public could not have been expected to fathom it then\n\n- and indeed has yet to appreciate it fully - the pair\'s cryptic account\n\nplaced at technology\'s disposal the basic mechanism of heredity.\n Humans had taken control of the molecular code that commands\n\nbiological growth and regeneration, and with that achievement has come the\n\npotential to combat some of the world\'s most pressing problems.\n The products of so-called genetic engineering - hardier and higher\n\nyeilding crops, more productive livestock, new vaccines, organisms that\n\nextract oil and minerals from the earth, and bugs that gobble waste - promise\n\ndeliverance from hunger, disease, environmental decay, and declining energy\n\nresources.\n Not to mention relief from a host of more benign aggravations: soon\n\nwe may produce vegetables that ripen on the vine without going soft, coffee\n\nplants with naturally decaffeinated beans, and  " super pigs" \n\nthat yield low-fat pork. \n\n  Yet along with the hopeful prospects, the Boyer-Cohen experiment\n\nalso succeeded in bringing to the forefront a litany of profound questions\n\nabout the risks of applying this new technique to humans and the environment.\n While the chemical industry began to dream of crops with greater\n\nresistance to herbicides and pesticides, some consumers began to challenge\n\nthe scant knowledge available about the toxicity of these chemicals.\n While other consumers began dreaming of flawless fruits and vegeta\n\n<l> bles, some farmers began to wonder about the ability of uniform crops to\n\nwithstand genetic diseases.\n While other farmers dreamed of microbial treatments to protect\n\nseedlings against frost and drought, doctors began to wonder about the\n\naccidental spread of experimentally concocted microbes to more vulnerable\n\nhabitats and about their effects on human health.\n\n\nitary deficiencies in humans, social scientists and theologians began to\n\nwonder about the propriety of  " playing God." \n Although these unsettling questions had been suggested by earlier\n\ngenetic research, it wasn\'t until 1973 that dealing with them became a\n\ncritical exercise.\n The sudden urgency with which they had come to be asked also\n\nconfirmed that Boyer and Cohen had, at the very least, given birth not only\n\nto a new form of life but to a major technological revolution. \n\n  Less than two decades later, the revolution known as\n\nbiotechnology has taken concrete shape around the world.\n Researchers at government, university, and private laboratories\n\nare now working at a feverish pace to develop new products for industrial and\n\nhousehold consumption - a pace that is understandably leaving legislators and\n\nregulators far behind.\n In biotechnology, Canada stands with a handful of countries at the\n\nvanguard of promoting an unprecedented economic and humanitarian opportunity.\n Like the development of nuclear power - to which biotechnology is so\n\noften compared - however, it is an opportunity in need of careful\n\npublic-policy attention.\n Accordingly, the federal government, chiefly through the National\n\nBiotechnology Advisory Committee of the Department of Industry, Science\n\nand Technology, has embarked on a process to develop just such a set of\n\nregulations.\n The nature of those regulations and the government\'s diligence\n\nin enforcing them will determine in large measure whether Canada succeeds in\n\nharnessing biotechnology\'s benefits while avoiding its risks.\n The opportunity is unique, and the issues are complex and varied.\n\n\n\n  Biotechnology, broadly speaking, is not new.\n Its origins date back eight to ten thousand years, when humans first\n\nbegan selecting plants for food crops.\n Most of our main staples can be traced back to those early discover\n\n<l> ies.\n Gradually our ancestors learned to breed new, more palatable and\n\nproductive varieties by means of cross-breeding.\n Animal domestication also has a long heritage, and the vast diversity\n\nwe see today in species like the dog is the result of primitive but\n\nintentional breeding.\n The ubiquity of livestock such as the cow is a reflection of the\n\nsuccess and economic relevance of that human intervention. \n\n  Though they could not be aware of it then, primitive plant and\n\nanimal breeders were brewing new combinations of the basic units of heredity\n\n- genes.\n By mating different varieties of the same species, and in rare cases\n\nmembers of different but sexually compatible species, genes became slightly\n\nmodified and expressed in subsequent generations.\n Genetic engineering, the process pioneered by Boyer and Cohen,\n\nhowever, represents a radical departure in speed and effectiveness.\n Its essence lies in the direct manipulation of the hereditary\n\nblueprint found in living cells, the deoxyribonucleic acid molecule, or DNA,\n\nof which genes are constructed. \n\n  First identified in the 1940s by Oswald Avery and described\n\nchemically in 1953 by Nobel Prize-winning researchers James Watson and\n\nFrancis Crick, DNA has become a synonym for modern biotechnology.\n Its celebrated double-helix structure is a wondrous example of\n\nchemistry\'s graceful symmetry.\n The DNA molecule consists of two long, spiralling strands of sugar\n\nand phosphate which are joined horizontally - as steps join the sides of a\n\nwinding staircase - by an alternating sequence of chemical structures.\n consists of a pair of\n\nchemicals called base pairs which jut out from the sugar-phosphate strands\n\nand are joined by weak chemical bonds in the middle.\n There are four bases - adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine - and\n\neach has an affinity for joining with only one of its potential partners:\n\nthymine with adneine and cytosine with guanine.\n It is in the sequence of these chemicals up and down the DNA strands\n\nthat genetic information is encoded, like the sequence of binary digits that\n\ninstructs a computer to perform its calculations.\n Depending on the order of the chemicals along distinct portions of\n\nthe DNA strand, the DNA molecule will instruct the body to synthesize a\n\nvariety of distinct chains of amino acids known as polypeptides.\n A gene is a linear segment of the DNA strand that contains enough\n\ninformation to direct the cell chemistry to compile a polypeptide.\n Polypeptides, in turn, are the building blocks of complex molecules\n\nknown as proteins. \n\n  Responsible for a wide range of biological functions in plants,\n\nanimals, and micro-organisms, proteins come in many different kinds and com\n\n<l> prise much of the dry weight of living organisms.\n They are composed of 20 different amino acids, differing in character\n\naccording to the number and order of amino acids in the protein chain.\n An average protein is composed of about 100 amino acids.\n The order of variously shaped amino acids causes a protein to fold\n\ninto a specific shape, and by virtue of that shape the protein possesses\n\ncertain properties that determine organic function and structure.\n Proteins, for example, can link with oxygen molecules in the air and\n\ncarry them to required parts of the body, or they can join together and form\n\nvisible body features such as hair and muscle.\n It is proteins, more than anything else, that are the stuff of life.\n\n\n\n  Biotechnology, whether through the direct intervention of genetic\n\nengineering or the relative pot luck of conventional breeding, exploits the\n\nrelationship between genes and the protein structures they are pro <l>\n\ngrammed to build.\n What permitted Boyer and Cohen to become direct causal agents in the\n\nfusion of genetic information from unrelated species was the discovery in\n\n1970 of a specific set of natural chemical tools known as restriction\n\nendonucleases that make it possible to splice segments of DNA from different\n\nstrands.\n These enzymes generally exist to restrict DNA from a foreign species\n\nfrom mingling with the genetic material in bacterial cells.\n Since the rules of DNA construction in theory permit DNA from any two\n\nspecies - whether bird, insect, fungus, or human - to intertwine, one of the\n\nways nature ensures the survival of living organisms by maintaining diversity\n\nis by erecting barriers to this intermingling.\n An example of such a barrier is the restriction endonuclease.\n When foreign DNA strays into a bacterial cell, these enzymes identify\n\nthe strand as foreign and defend the bacterial DNA by shattering it to\n\npieces.\n Fortunately for the genetic engineer, the attack is very\n\nsystematic.\n Each type of restriction endonuclease is trained to splice a DNA\n\nstrand at a specific sequence of base pairs to which it has an aversion.\n In doing so, it leaves the broken pieces of DNA - there can be\n\nmillions of them, depending on the length and make-up of the original DNA -\n\nwith split ends, like the dangling copper ends of a severed extension cord.\n These dangling, unmated bases have a tendency to recombine either\n\nwith their original base-pair partners or with other dangling bases that\n\npossess a complementary sequence to their own.\n But because of the great numbers of broken pieces of DNA created by\n\nthe shattering, it is unlikely they will recombine directly with the\n\ncomplementary bases of their original DNA mates.\n So they recombine randomly with neighboring DNA segments, producing a\n\nhost of small and disordered DNA strands. \n\n  Genetic engineers use the destructive capacity of restriction\n\nendonucleases to shatter and combine DNA strands from different species.\n In laboratories, DNA strands from two species are mixed with the\n\nrestriction endonucleases.\n Pieces from the two previously distinct DNA strands, having been\n\nshattered at similar base-pair-sequence points, have an equal tendency to\n\ncombine with each other as with pieces from their original DNA strands.\n The random recombination yields a mixture of thousands ( and perhaps\n\nmillions) of diverse molecules, many of them consisting of DNA from both\n\nspecies, known as recombinant DNA.\n To this mixture, the genetic engineer then adds enzymes known as\n\nligases to cement the bonds. \n\n  For a piece of recombinant DNA to be useful in industrial\n\napplications, many copies are needed.\n Since living cells are capable of dividing rapidly - and in so doing\n\nmake identical copies of their DNA - genetic engineers use them as DNA\n\nfactories.\n To accomplish this they mix a collection of recombinant DNA into a\n\npool of bacterial cells.\n There, parts of cells known as plasmids, pieces of DNA which normally\n\nmove benignly in an out of cells, latch on to stray bits of foreign DNA and\n\nshuttle them into cells.\n In some cases, viruses, which also have a tendency to latch on to\n\nDNA, are used.\n When a virus succeeds in invading a cell, it may also carry with it\n\nbits of foreign DNA.\n In either case, out of the vast and disorganized colony of altered\n\ncells in the broth, cells containing the desired DNA segments ( which are far\n\ntoo small to be detected microscopically) must be identified.\n This can be accomplished using a variety of methods.\n In one method, the broth is laced with radioactivated RNA molecules\n\nwhich hone in on the desired DNA strip and mark it.\n According to another, the protein produced by a selected cell is\n\nisolated and matched against the protein known to be produced by the desired\n\nDNA segment.\n Once a bacterium possessing the desired DNA segment - or gene - is\n\nlocated, it can be removed from the broth.\n These cells can then be cultivated in large quantities to become\n\nthe drugs, the chemicals, and the microbes of modern biotechnology.\n They are what hold the promise and the threat of an industry which,\n\njust two decades ago, was relegated almost exclusively to government and\n\nuniversity laboratories, and which, propelled by private enterprise, has\n\nbecome a multi-billion-dollar business.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'dbccfa8f-1908-4e95-b3f5-ffb69149acd2', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.780186+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9600706696510315, 'non_english_score': 0.039929330348968506}
{'text': 'The first sector to capitalize on genetic engineering was health\n\ncare, particularly in the US.\n In 1983, 10 years after Boyer and Cohen performed the first\n\nrecombinant DNA experiment, scientists cultivated large quantities of\n\nthe human gene responsible for synthesizing insulin and marketed it as a\n\ntreatment for diabetics.\n Among the most commercially significant products to emerge since the\n\nearly 1980s, in addition to insulin, are human growth hormone ( which combats\n\ndwarfism), alpha interferon ( an immune-system stimulator which helps ward\n\noff disease), tissue plasminogen activator ( which can dissolve blood\n\nclots in heart-attack patients), a hepatitis-B vaccine, Ortho  OKT-3 ( which helps prevent kidney transplant\n\nrejection), and a drug called Epogen ( which fights anemia).\n Annual worldwide sales of just these seven products have reached\n\n&dollar;1.25 billion US ( Gianturco 208).\n Worldwide sales of all biotechnology products last year reached\n\n&dollar;6 billion.\n By the turn of the century sales are expected to soar to more than\n\n&dollar;100 billion (  Canadian Biotech  12). \n\n  That remarkable growth is now being fuelled by rapidly evolving\n\npatent legislation.\n In perhaps the most sensational event in the brief history of modern\n\nbiotechnology, the US Patent and Trademark Office in 1987 passed a policy\n\nstating that it  " considers non-naturally occurring nonhuman\n\nmulticellular living organisms, including animals, to be patentable subject\n\nmatter"  ( Wallis 78).\n That declaration prompted fierce opposition from animal-rights\n\nactivists who feared the policy would promote the exploratory production of\n\nmisfit animals incapable of fighting pain or disease.\n In Canada, after 10 years of controversy, Parliament this summer\n\npassed Bill C-15, the plant  rights act.\n Though not as sweeping as the US policy, the legislation for the\n\nfirst time puts plant breeders on a par with inventors of machinery and\n\nmanufacturing processes, permitting them to protect their new plant varieties\n\nwith 18-year patents.\n As a result, plant breeders will not only be able to collect\n\nroyalties for the seeds they sell but also for the seed adult plants\n\nsubsequently produce.\n Since the bill was introduced in its original form by the liberal\n\ngovernment in 1980, some farm groups, led by the National \n\nUnion, have been insisting it will hand over control of the food supply\n\nto a handful of large multi-national corporations. \n\n  Even in the absence of incentive legislation, however, the\n\nCanadian biotechnology industry\'s growth to date has been impressive.\n Sales of Canadian biotechnology products reached &dollar;660 million\n\nin 1988, while the industry as a whole posted a net after-tax loss of only\n\n&dollar;3 million, a remarkably strong performance for an infant industry\n\nthat is having to invest considerably in manufacturing facilities and\n\nmarketing efforts.\n During that same year, Canada\'s biotechnology companies spent a\n\nsubstantial &dollar;275 million on research and development.\n While many of Canada\'s biotechnology enterprises are newly created\n\ndepartments of large industrial firms, most are privately owned\n\nstart-ups employing fewer than 50 people. \n\n  Building on Canada\'s historical strength in agricultural,\n\nmetallurgical, and forestry research, the industry is distinguished by its\n\nprimary focus on resource-based products and by its diversity.\n A recent survey of the industry sponsored by the Department of\n\nIndustry, Science and Technology and the National Research Council ( NRC )\n\nreveals that: \n The products and processes invented and sold by Canadian\n\nbiotechnology companies involve nearly every industrial sector.\n They include cloned varieties of ornamental plants, bioleaching\n\nin the mining of uranium and gold, quick tip-of-the-tongue tests to measure\n\nblood alcohol, anaerobic digestion systems for the treatment of pulp mill\n\neffluents, the world\'s first conjugate vaccine, cattle improvement through\n\nnuclear transplantation and embryo cloning, monoclonal antibodies for blood\n\ntyping, soil microbes to improve plant growth, diagnostic kits for AIDS, the\n\nbrewing of beer, biological pesticides, and mass production of bio <l>\n\nlogical reagents from eggs and plants. (  Canadian Biotech  1)\n\n  \n\n  According to that survey, more than 10,000 products are currently\n\nunder development, 76% of which are being developed by seed companies.\n\n\n\n  The Canadian industry\'s plans for future growth are equally\n\nimpressive.\n Companies plan to spend almost &dollar;7 million each on new manufac\n\n<l> turing facilities by 1992.\n By the same year, the industry expects to hire 5,000 new employees,\n\nnearly doubling its 1989 work-force.\n Sales are expected to grow at an average annual rate of 46% between\n\n1988 and 1992, reaching &dollar;5 billion.\n The expectations seem realistic, too.\n About half of the 220 companies involved in biotechnology in Canada\n\nreported net profits in 1988.\n Overall, the firms are less indebted than those of many established\n\nindustrial sectors, with an average debt-to-equity ratio in 1988 of 0.47.\n The average assets-to-liability ratio for the industry was a\n\nrelatively healthy 2.3 (  Canadian Biotech  6). \n\n  Such statistics reveal a vibrant and remarkably strong industry.\n Yet the overall picture points to more than an increase in efficiency\n\nand quantity of research.\n It also reflects an impressive shift in demographics.\n Private-sector involvement is rapidly growing against public-sector\n\nactivity.\n Where once research proceeded almost exclusively according to\n\npublic-policy objectives and at the discretion of government funding bodies,\n\nprivate capital is fuelling an expanding proportion of the new growth.\n The dynamics of the marketplace will inevitably play an increasingly\n\nvital role in the guidance of that growth.\n Clearly, the power and priorities of Canadian biotechnology\n\nresearch are changing.\n What will some of those early priorities be, and what are the\n\nimplications for public policy? \n\n\n  The risks associated with the progress of biotechnology can be\n\ndivided into two categories, those that arise from the research activities\n\nthemselves and those that arise from the application of its products.\n With the Canadian biotechnology industry still in its infancy, and\n\nthe bulk of its products still in development, the most imminent risks to\n\nconsider stem from the process, as opposed to the application, of\n\nresearch.\n Ominous signs of the level of ignorance among biotechnology\n\nresearchers of the regulations that apply to their industry are already\n\nevident.\n In the survey of 84 companies conducted by the federal government and\n\nthe NRC from November 1988 to February 1989, only 29 respondents were\n\nfamiliar with the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and its implications\n\nfor industrial biotechnology.\n Although ignorance of regulations will not be tolerated as a plea by\n\nthe courts, that can only be cold comfort when irresponsible practices have a\n\nvast potential to alter - or even destroy - parts of  <-> the <->  the\n\n  environment.\n If biotechnology has the capacity to do irrevocable damage to humans\n\nor their surroundings, retroactive enforcement through punishment could\n\nbe irrelevant.\n Measures to ensure compliance will be - and clearly already are -\n\nessential.\n Regulatory authorities will thus have to work alongside the\n\nindustrial biotechnology community to assist in making every member\n\naware of the laws and guidelines that apply to their practices. \n\n  Enforcement presents another challenge.\n As in nuclear research, the containment of potentially hazardous\n\nmaterial is a genuine problem, albeit only in a very small minority of cases.\n While established firms are likely to conform voluntarily with public\n\npolicies associated with research methods, smaller firms, which prevail in\n\nbiotechnology, are likely to take more risks.\n This situation stands in stark contrast to the nuclear industry\n\nwhere, because of the scale required by the research and its complexity,\n\nsmall companies are effectively precluded from participating.\n A sound regulatory policy should contain provisions for random\n\ninvestigation of private laboratories - not unlike the scrutiny to which the\n\nfood industry is subject - to ensure that proper measures are taken to\n\nminimize the accidental release of potentially hazardous organisms. \n\n  The risks associated with the testing or application of products\n\nin the environment, especially micro-organisms, represent perhaps the\n\nmost critical area for regulation ( Doyle 50).\n to alter the\n\nenvironment.\n Concerns for the long-term, broad ecological impact of biotechnology\n\nwill have special relevance to Canadian research and development, where the\n\nvast majority of products are emerging from the natural-resource sectors,\n\nparticularly agriculture.\n Monitoring and controlling the effects of that alteration will\n\nbe the key issues. \n\n\n  When considering ramifications of the products of biotechnology,\n\nthe vast majority of which have yet to enter the market, an immediate dilemma\n\npresents itself.\n Is it possible to regulate effectively an enterprise in which\n\npotential risks have yet to be uncovered?\n The constant pressure to anticipate risks means regulatory\n\nagencies must place strong emphasis on the evolution of policy itself.\n The explosive growth of the industry underscores the urgency of that\n\nneed.\n Co-operation from private industry would help identify areas of\n\npotential public concern, but it is insufficient.\n Neutral expertise is critical.\n In an era when so many publicly-funded research institutions have\n\nseen their direct government support diminish against the growth of even\n\nmoderately expanding industries, and have seen their historical neutrality\n\ncompromised by the growing tendency to make federal funding for research\n\ncontingent upon industrial investment, the capacity of the vibrant\n\nprivate biotechnology industry seems poised to outstrip the resources of\n\nthose very scientists whose independent expertise will be critical for\n\ninforming public policy.\n Even if funding for public research were to be maintained at a\n\nrelatively high level of 4%-6% of real growth, it is hardly a match for the\n\n46% annual rate at which the industry plans to expand.\n Government and university research efforts in biotechnology cannot be\n\nallowed to languish in their present state of underfunding.\n Among other things, public and university laboratories will have to\n\nstep up research into mathematical modelling and controlled-field testing in\n\norder to establish a predictive ecology before widespread release takes\n\nplace. \n\n  Another systematic trend that may compromise the goal of a sound\n\nand publicly supported regulatory system is evident in the the manner in\n\nwhich the newly formed National Biotechnology Advisory Committee operates -\n\nnamely, under the auspices of the federal Department of Industry, Science and\n\nTechnology.\n "\n\ndevelopment, exploitation and applications of strategic technologies to\n\nimprove Canada\'s international competitiveness"  (  " Regu <l>\n\nlatory Concerns"  ) .\n Environment Canada, on the other hand, has no such mandate, and its\n\nadvice ought to take a prime role in the formulation of regulations.\n Can the Department of Industry, Science and Technology and the\n\nregulatory advisory body it oversees continue to be regarded as neutral\n\nsources of scrutiny by the biotechnology industry\'s present critics, while\n\nthat department offers direct or indirect subsidies to industry and publicly\n\nchampions industry\'s attempts to become globally competitive? \n\n  Even more important, because more than three-quarters of the prod\n\n<l> ucts under development in Canada fall into the category of seed research,\n\nCanadian regulations will require specific attention to the impact of this\n\nresearch on accidental transmission and genetic diversity.\n Plant research, unlike chemical, pharmaceutical, and animalian\n\nresearch, will in many cases require widespread dispersal of experimental\n\ngenetic material into the environment.\n Geographically dispersed material is generally more susceptible\n\nto the influences of a host of uncontrollable environmental factors, such as\n\nbioleaching into soil and transport by wind, micro-organisms, and animals.\n Measures for assessing the potential of accidental transport, as well\n\nas the eventual fate of experimental material in the environment, will be\n\ncrucial. \n\n  Because agricultural applications of biotechnology can be\n\nexpected to produce key crops with higher commercial value, it can be\n\nexpected that biotechnology companies will find willing customers in the\n\nCanadian farming industry.\n Measures should be taken to ensure that any reduction in genetic\n\ndiversity through the widespread planting of these key crops will not make\n\nthe food supply more susceptible to genetic diseases.\n This may entail preserving a greater number of existing varieties in\n\nseed banks.\n The potential for lost diversity also raises an interesting question\n\nfor the issue of farm support.\n Will farmers who attempt to remain competitive by planting only those\n\ncrops with the highest commercial value be required to bear the burden of\n\nsudden losses to their incomes if their crops are wiped out by disease? \n\n  Insurance against such catastrophes might be obtained in another,\n\npotentially more controversial way.\n " super"\n\n varieties, it is possible to  promote  the desirable goal\n\nof genetic diversity by taxing the consumption of these crops.\n While the idea of limiting consumer choice through disincentives\n\nmight seem antithetical to a market-driven economy, it is nevertheless\n\nconsistent with a society that places high value on environmental security\n\nand human health.\n Many western societies have already set precedents for\n\nmarket-intervention where public health and safety have been concerned.\n\n\ninterests, have enjoyed widespread public support in many countries,\n\nincluding Canada.\n Would it be unthinkable, then, to impose taxes on crop varieties\n\nthat, because of their popularity, limit diversity and thus threaten the food\n\nsupply?\n It has been suggested in the case of tobacco, and not without\n\nreasonable justification, that a portion of the proceeds from taxes be\n\ndiverted to hospitals for the treatment of cancer and heart disease.\n Would it be unreasonable to divert the proceeds from taxes on popular\n\ncrops toward maintaining seed banks? \n\n  As important as any specific regulatory consideration, finally,\n\nis the active participation of the public throughout the advisory process.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '0a8caa0e-36fd-48bb-ae4f-c0e4ed90e6b2', 'added':

Bot.  67  : 954-960. \n\n  Wetland vegetation on lowlands of northern Yukon was related to\n\ngradients of pH, peat depth, and active-layer depth using detrended\n\ncorrespondence analysis.\n Seven vegetation types were distinguished by two-way indicator\n\nspecies analysis:   Arctophila  shoreline \n\nmarsh,   Carex aquatilis - Sphagnum - Chamaedaphne \n\n wet meadow,   Scorpidium   - sedge\n\ncarpet,   Carer rotundata - Andromeda - Sphagnum orientate\n\n  lawn,   Sphagnum   - heath on\n\nfirm peat, thickets and tussock tundra, and   Calamagrostis\n\ncanadensis   meadow.\n marshes and tussocky\n\nshrublands resemble other sites in the subarctic and low arctic wetland\n\nregions of North America while   Sphagnum   -\n\nheath on firm peat is typical of high boreal and subarctic wetlands.\n The wet meadow, carpet. and lawn types of sedge - moss vegetation\n\ncannot be characterized as arctic or boreal because the geographic patterns\n\nof sedge - moss wetlands in northwestern North America remain unclear. \n\n\n\n\n  Vegetation associations and habitat gradients have been\n\ndetermined from a few wetland complexes in the Canadian Arctic ( Muc 1977;\n\nVitt and Pakarinen 1977; Sheard and Geale 1983; Miller and Alpert 1984) and\n\nfrom several complexes in the low and mid-boreal ( see Kenkel 1987) wetland\n\nregions, as mapped by the National Wetlands Working Group ( 1986).\n Comparable studies are rare in the subarctic and high boreal wetland\n\nregions, which include the most extensive peat deposits of North America.\n Permafrost influences the development and morphology of wetlands\n\n( Zoltai and Tarnocai 1975) in these regions, which include the zone of\n\ndiscontinuous permafrost and the southern fringe of the continuous perma <l>\n\nfrost zone ( Brown 1977).\n Polygonal peat plateaux, peat plateaux, and patterned fens\n\ncharacterize subarctic wetlands.\n Permafrost underlies all wetlands but shoreline fens in the high\n\nsubarctic, but is absent from patterned fens in the low subarctic ( National\n\nWetlands Working Group 1986). \n\n  A peatland project in northern Yukon Territory provided a chance\n\nto describe several sites in a large wetland complex of the high subarctic\n\nwetland region.\n This paper provides a floristic and structural description of these\n\nwetlands and relates them to other reports of wetland vegetation in\n\nnorthwestern North America. \n\n\n  Two large old lake basins occur near the village of Old Crow,\n\nabout 150 km south of the Beaufort Sea ( Fig. 1).\n Glacial meltwater deposited a thick bed of grey clay during the Late\n\nWisconsinan stadial and finally drained away by 12 000 years BP ( Matthews et\n\nal. 1987).\n Today the basins are poorly drained expanses of patterned peatland\n\nand shallow thermokarst lakes.\n Shoreline erosion is active in many lakes.\n Regional treeline is just north of the Old Crow Flats.\n Mean July and January temperatures at Old Crow are 14.2 and -\n\n33.1&degree;C, respectively, and mean annual temperature is - 10.1&degree;C.\n Mean annual precipitation is 215 mm ( Environment Canada 1982).\n The mean annual number of thawing degree-days is about 1900 ( Burns\n\n1973).\n The area lies within the southernmost part of the continuous perma\n\n<l> frost zone ( Brown 1977). \n\n\n  In July of 1979 and 1981, field studies were carried out by the\n\nfirst author.\n The second author identified most moss collections, except for\n\n  Sphagnum   specimens, which were identified by\n\nD. H. Vitt, University of Alberta.\n Voucher specimens of the mosses are deposited at Memorial University\n\nand the Univesity of Alberta. \n\n  At each vegetation site, the percent cover of each species was\n\nestimated within an area of 50 - 100 m  2  .\n In fields of low-centre polygons, separate species lists were\n\ncompiled for the wet centres and dry ridges of the polygons.\n Mosses that could not be identified in the field were characterized\n\nand collected: as a check, several handfuls of moss were gathered at random\n\nthroughout the site and later identified. \n\n  Three habitat variables at each site were measured: pH ( using\n\nnarrow range dual strip test paper), depth to frost table, and depth of peat\n\n( defined as material with loss-on-ignition greater than 80%).\n Water pH at each site was tested, either in a polygon trough, between\n\ntussocks, in an adjacent pool, or as seepage into a soil pit.\n To convert depth to frost table to a less date-dependent estimate of\n\nactive layer depth, 0.2 cm was added to the measurement for each day before\n\nAugust 1 that it was made.\n Since rate of thaw is highly dependent on moisture conditions at a\n\nsite ( Brown 1977: Ryden and Kostov 1980), this estimate of active-layer\n\ndepth is an index of the relative wetness of each site.  \n\n  Estimates of percent cover were obtained for 65 vascular and 70\n\nmoss taxa noted from 74 vegetation sites.\n This data set was condensed by removing taxa that occurred in two\n\nsites or less, and by grouping species within some genera.\n Structure in the resulting data set, of 50 vascular and 39\n\nnonvascular taxa, was explored by ordination ( detrended correspondence\n\nanalysis, DECORANA ) and classification ( two-way indicator species analysis,\n\nTWINSPAN ) procedures. \n\n\n  The first axis of the ordination reflects a strong moisture gra\n\n<l> dient ( Fig. 2), indicated by a high correlation (  r  = 0.79)\n\nof stand score on this axis with active-layer depth.\n At all but two of the sites ( 27, 30) with scores over 100 on the\n\nfirst axis, the water table occurred at or above the vegetation surface. \n\n  The second axis is significantly correlated with peat depth (\n\n r  = - 0.44,  p  &lt; 0.05).\n Sites with a mineral substrate have high scores on this axis and\n\ninclude species that are early colonizers of drained lakebeds on the arctic\n\ncoast ( Ovenden 1986):   Arctophila fulva, Calamagrostis\n\ncanadensis, Arctagrostis latifolia, Equisetum arvense   ,\n\nand   Stellaria longipes   .\n The distribution of ice wedge polygons is also related to peat depth\n\n( all sites with &gt; 80 cm peat have polygonal patterns).\n Consequently, most sites that lack distinct ice wedge polygons have\n\nhigh scores on the second axis. \n\n  Although pH is an imperfect index of dissolved nutrients in fen\n\nwaters ( Sj&ouml;rs 1983), it is closely related to the vegetational gradient\n\npoor fen - rich fen ( Sj&ouml;rs 1983) and may be linked to trophic status (\n\nPakarinen and Ruuhij&auml;rvi 1978).\n The pH of the Old Crow sites varies from 4.2-5.8; this gradient is\n\nsignificantly correlated with both the first axis (  r  = 0.46)\n\nand second axis (  r  = 0.41) of the vegetation ordination.\n Sites with low pH and species characteristic of poor fens and\n\noligotrophic mires in Scandinavia ( Sj&ouml;rs 1983; Pakarinen and\n\nRuuhij&auml;rvi 1978) have low scores on both the first and second axes,\n\nwhile sites with pH &gt; 5.0 and species typical of more minerotrophic mires\n\nhave high scores. \n\n  Scorpidium scorpioides,\n\nCalliergon trifarium, Campylium stellatum   , and\n\n  Tomenthypnum nitens   , are indicators of rich\n\nfens ( pH &gt; 5.8; Sj&ouml;rs 1950, 1983), but these species grow profusely\n\nand commonly in the study area at a pH of 5.0-5.6.\n This phenomenon has also been observed on nutrient-deficient\n\npeatlands of the Soviet tundra zone ( Botch and Masing 1983). \n\n  TWINSPAN identified seven physiognomic vegetation types ( Table\n\n1).\n Observations of aquatic vegetation in lakes of the region will be\n\nprovided first, followed by descriptions of the seven vegetation types. \n\n\n  Most of these lakes are 2-3m deep ( Matthews et al. 1987) with a\n\npH of 5.0-5.6.\n (\n\nespecially in the Bluefish Basin and southern half of the Old Crow Flats) and\n\nmore rarely,   Ceratophyllum demersum   ( Cwynar\n\n1983).\n A large shallow lake in the western Old Crow Flats ( XV on Fig. 1) is\n\nmostly 65 cm deep with 5-40% cover of   Potamogeton richardsonii\n\n  .\n\n\nPotamogeton alpinus   subsp.   tenuifolius, Pota\n\n<l> mogeton cf. Berchtoldii, Hippuris vulgaris, Myriophyllum spicatum, and\n\n  Callitriche hermaphroditica   are abundant.\n\n\nNitella   occur in the surface sediment of some lakes (\n\nOvenden 1985). \n\n\nmarsh  \n\n  Each of the three sites studied is a band of marshy vegetation\n\ngrowing in up to 65 cm of water in silty sediment.\n\n\nCarex aquatilis   are the dominant vascular taxa. Loose,\n\nfloating mats of   Drepanocladus exannulatus, Potentilla\n\npalustris   , and   Myriophyllum spicatum \n\n are also important.\n Ranunculus trichophyllus, R. gmelinii, Eleocharis\n\nacicularis   , and   Senecio congestus \n\n , which occur as seeds in nearshore sediments of the lakes (\n\nOvenden 1985), are probably present, in addition to other taxa listed in\n\nTable 1. \n Carex aquatilis - Chamaedaphne -\n\nSphagnum   meadow  \n\n  These sites consist of scattered low shrubs in a moderately dense\n\nsward of rhizomatous sedges and cottongrass.\n The moss cover is almost continuous and occurs in semisubmersed,\n\nfloating, and soft cushion forms.\n\n\n Andromedia polifolia, Chamaedaphne calyculata, Carex aquatilis \n\n , and   Eriophorum russeolum   .\n\n  Drepanocladus   and   Sphagnum\n\n  grew at each site, particularly   D.\n\nlapponicus, D. exannulatus, S. squarrosum, S. rubellum, S. warnstorfii, and\n\nS. fuscum   .\n Betula glandulosa, Potentilla palustris, Oxycoccus,\n\nCarex chordorrhiza   , and   Meesia \n\n spp. are also characteristic.\n Of the five sites in this group, two occurred in recent meander\n\nswales of the Old Crow River, one bordered a small pond, and two formed broad\n\nmeadows in young thermokarst basins.\n The pH was 5.0 at the two last sites.\n None displayed obvious ice-wedge polygons or oriented peat ridges.\n\n   \n sedge\n\ncarpet  \n\n  This distinctive assemblage usually contains the following taxa:\n\n  Scorpidium scorpioides, Drepanocladus revolvens, Cal <l>\n\nliergon trifarium, Carex limosa, Carex rotundata, Carex chordorrhiza,\n\nEriophorum russeolum, Eriophorum angustifolium, Utricularia intermedia \n\n , and   Menyanthes trifoliata   .\n They form a loose mat that floats over flocculent organic mud.\n is lacking or sparse except\n\nat site 54, where S.  jensenii  is dominant.\n Five sites from group 3 border ponds or lakes and exhibit no peat\n\nridges or evidence of polygons.\n The remainder are enclosed by a polygonal or more irregular network\n\nof frostcored peat ridges.\n Frozen substrate occurred 39 - 58 cm beneath eight of the sites, but\n\nnone was found ( within 80 cm) at the remaining three sites.\n The pH ranged from 5.0 - 5.8 except at site 54, where it was 4.4.\n\n\n Carex rotundata - Andromeda -\n\nSphagnum orientale   lawn  \n\n  All sites in this group are low-centre polygons.\n At most, the vegetation is a diffuse lawn of sedges and dwarf shrubs\n\nin a floating moss mat, with an active layer of 46 - 56 cm.\n Site 9 is firmer.\n\n\nmeda polifolia   , and   Sphagnum orientale \n\n .\n Oxycoccus, Eriophorum russeolum,\n\nPedicularis, Trichophorum caespitosum, Sphagnum balticum   ,\n\nand   Drepanocladus   are usually present.\n\n heath on\n\nfirm peat  \n\n \n\ngonal peat plateaus with level or slightly concave polygons 20 - 30 m in\n\ndiameter.\n Most are acidic ( pH = 4.4), with a shallow active layer.\n At some sites ( 39, 40, 49, 56, 60, 66), the peat is over 1.5 m deep\n\nand represents 5000 - 11 000 years accumulation ( Ovenden 1985).\n The younger, shallower peat deposits are indistinctly polygonal or\n\nlack ice wedges.\n Low shrubs and mosses generally predominate, although most of the\n\nground cover is ericaceous litter and lichens at the drier sites.\n The peat forms a firm, even ground surface and sedge tussocks are not\n\nimportant, as they are in group 6.\n Ledum\n\ndecumbens, Vaccinium vitis - idaea, Andromeda, Rubus chamaemorus, Betula\n\nglandulosa, Eriophorum vaginatum, Polytrichum, Aulacomnium turgidum,\n\nDicranum angustum   , and lichens.  \n Sites of group 5 are distinguished from those in group 6 by the\n\npresence of   Sphagnum lenense, S. fuscum, S. balticum, \n\n and abundant   Rubus chamaemorus   .\n\n\n spp.) throughout the Bluefish Basin and along the southern margin\n\nof the Old Crow Flats. \n Group 6: Tall shrub thickets, tussock tundra, and tussock\n\nwoodlands  \n\n  Salix\n\npulchra, Salix glauca, Betula glandulosa   , and ( or)\n\n  Alnus crispa   , with a ground layer of sedge\n\nor cottongrass tussocks and dwarf shrubs.\n\n\nstaphylos rubra, Carex lugens, Sphagnum fimbriatum, Hylocomium splendens,\n\n  and   Aulacomnium palustre  \n\ndistinguish this group.", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5e131b16-17ae-4be7-8c21-18a65fca64e2', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.783080+00:00', 'english_score': 0.8804864287376404, 'non_english_score': 0.11951357126235962}

Bot. 67: 961 - 969. \n\n  Species - area relations of vascular plants and the effect of\n\nnesting colonies of gulls on plant species composition were investigated\n\nfor 77 islands in Georgian Bay and Lake Huron in the Great Lakes region of\n\nCanada.\n The percentage of plant species classed as alien, annual, or biennial\n\nwas significantly greater on islands with gull colonies.\n The slope of the species - area curve was significantly steeper on\n\nislands supporting gull colonies compared with islands lacking gull colonies.\n The expected decline in species richness with increased island\n\nremoteness was not detected statistically using multiple regression analysis.\n The difference in species - area slopes does not appear to reflect a\n\nlower propagule immigration rate to islands with gull colonies, because gulls\n\nare important in the dispersal of alien plant species to these islands.\n Larger islands with gull colonies tended to have richer floras than\n\nislands of similar size without gull colonies.\n It is suggested that on these larger islands the presence of gull\n\ncolonies produces a gradient of soil nutrient and disturbance regimes, thus\n\nincreasing habitat heterogeneity and species richness.  \n\n\n \n\ntion is often strongly affected by guano deposition and physical disturbance\n\nassociated with nesting activity ( Gillham 1956; Sobey and Kenworthy 1979:\n\nHogg and Morton 1983).\n\n\nnials to be replaced by annuals, and for native species to be replaced by\n\nalien weeds ( Gillham 1961; Hogg and Morton 1983).\n The severe conditions associated with active seabird nesting sites\n\ncan also result in species-poor plant communities ( Gillham 1960, 1962;\n\nWeseloh and Brown 1971; McCain 1975; Sobey and Kenworthy 1979; Hogg and\n\nMorton 1983).\n\n\nbirds because of the protection that they offer against mammalian\n\npredators ( Southern et al. 1985; Timoney et al. 1985).\n However, few studies of island biogeography have specifically\n\ninvestigated the impact of nesting seabirds on the composition and species\n\nrichness of island floras. \n\n  In Georgian Bay and the Canadian part of Lake Huron, there are\n\nnumerous small islands, many of which harbour large colonies of nesting\n\nRing-billed and Herring Gulls (   Larus delawarensis \n\n and   Larus argentatus   ) .\n The population of nesting gulls in the region was estimated at 172\n\n000 pairs in 1980,which represents a major increase during the previous 20\n\nyears ( Weseloh et al. 1986).\n Human disturbance is minimal on most of the islands, thus providing\n\nan excellent opportunity for a phytogeographic study of island floras, some\n\nof which are being strongly affected by gull nesting activity.\n The objective of this study was to examine the floras of these\n\nislands in relation to their size, distance from the nearest mainland,\n\nand the presence or absence of nesting gulls. \n\n  , of the power function relationship\n\nbetween species number and island size has received considerable atten <l>\n\ntion in the literature ( Gilbert 1980).\n were often used to test\n\npredictions arising from the MacArthur and Wilson ( 1963, 1967) equilibrium\n\ntheory of island biogeography, but this approach has recently been\n\ncriticized for several reasons ( see Connor and McCoy 1979: Gilbert 1980;\n\nMartin 1981; Abbott 1983).\n for islands with\n\nand without gull colonies primarily as a tool to examine the influence of\n\nnesting gulls on plant species richness over a wide range of island size.\n We also used multiple regression analysis to factor out the\n\neffect of area on species diversity ( Connor and McCoy 1979) so that the\n\neffect of gull colonies and island remoteness on plant species number could\n\nbe investigated.   \n\n\n  The islands selected for this study are limestone and dolomite\n\nislands of Lake Huron, Georgian Bay, and the North Channel ( Fig. I).\n Most have a low relief, rising only a few metres above present-day\n\nlake levels.\n During the Nipissing period, which lasted from about 6000 to 4000\n\nyears ago, lake levels in the region were about 16 - 23 m higher relative to\n\npresent-day shorelines ( Nichols 1972; Morton and Venn 1984, 1987).\n Thus, nearly all of these islands have emerged as dry land since\n\nthen, and many are probably no more than a few hundred years old.\n As a result, their floras have been derived from the neighbouring\n\nmainland and islands by dispersal across the intervening expanses of fresh\n\nwater.\n Most of the species show clear adaptations for dispersal by water and\n\nbirds, while a few appear to have been dispersed by wind or human activity (\n\nJ. K. Morton and E. H. Hogg, unpublished). \n\n  Many of the islands have extensive, sparsely vegetated beaches of\n\ngravel, cobbles, and slabs pushed up by waves and winter ice.\n On several, there are limestome pavements that support a rich\n\nherbaceous flora.\n These beaches and limestone pavements provide nesting habitat for\n\nlarge colonies of Ring-billed and Herring Gulls that strongly affect the\n\nvegetation of their nesting sites ( Hogg and Morton 1983).\n The larger islands are mainly wooded, usually with a dense scrub\n\nforest of   Betula papyrifera, Populus tremuloides, Prunus\n\nvirginiana, Thuja occidentalis, Abies balsamea,   and\n\n  Picea glauca   with occasional  \n\nSorbus decora, Populus balsamifera, Fraxinus pennsylvanica \n\n , and   Ulmus americana   .\n\n\n\n  The analysis is based on the vascular floras of 77 limestone and\n\ndolomite islands in Georgian Bay, Lake Huron, and the North Channel in\n\nOntario, Canada.\n Floristic data used in the analysis came from the following sources:\n\nMorton and Venn ( 1984) for the islands adjacent Manitoulin Island; Morton\n\nand Venn ( 1987) for the Tobermory Islands off the northern tip of the\n\nBruce Peninsula; J. K. Morton and E. H. Hogg ( unpublished) for Barrier\n\nIsland near Cape Croker on the Bruce Peninsula; and J. K. Morton and J. M.\n\nVenn ( unpublished) for North and South Limestone Islands in eastern Georgian\n\nBay ( Fig. 1).\n The area of each island was determined from 1 : 50 000 scale\n\ntopographic maps or, for the smaller islands, from nautical charts ( 1 : 40\n\n000 or 1 : 15 000 scale), based on the number of 1 - mm grid squares occupied\n\nby the island on graph paper overlaying the map or chart.\n The distance of each island to the nearest mainland was also\n\ndetermined.\n ) and narrowly\n\nseparated from the north shore of Georgian Bay and the North Channel, was\n\nconsidered to be  " mainland"  for the purposes of this study.\n\n\n\n  i\n\n ) islands with a high density of nesting seabirds (  " gull\n\nislands"  ) and (  ii  ) islands lacking seabird nests or\n\nhaving a low nest density (  " non-gull islands"  ) .\n For most islands, the mean number of nests per hectare was\n\ncalculated using the 1980 seabird census data provided by the Canadian\n\nWildlife Service ( Weseloh et al. 1986).\n However, because of variability in seabird colony size from year to\n\nyear, we supplemented this information with field observations made\n\nduring the present study and from an earlier seabird census ( Ludwig 1962).\n Of the 77 islands examined, 27 were designated as gull islands ( mean\n\nnest density ranged from 35 - 4000 nests/ha) while the remaining 50 were\n\nclassed as nongull islands ( 0 - 8 nests/ha).\n Ring-billed and Herring Gulls were by far the most abundant seabird\n\nspecies, but there were also nesting populations of Common and Caspian Terns\n\n(   Sterna hirundo   and   Sterna\n\ncaspia   ) and rookeries of the Great Blue Heron ( \n\n Ardea herodias   ) on several of the islands. \n\n  Each vascular plant species recorded was categorized according to\n\nits probable origin ( i.e., native or alien) following Morton and Venn (\n\n1984, 1987); and its life history characteristic ( annual, biennial, or\n\nperennial) was categorized according to Fernald ( 1950), Gleason ( 1952), and\n\nMcDonald ( 1937).\n For each island, the number of species in each of the following\n\ncategories was recorded: alien annual, alien biennial, alien perennial,\n\nnative annual, native biennial, and native perennial.\n The percentage of species in each category was then calculated\n\nfrom the total flora of each island.\n The aresine transformation ( Zar 1984) was applied to the percentage\n\ndata and two-sample  t  - tests were used to compare the floras of\n\ngull and nongull islands.\n Because of the influence of human activity on several of the larger\n\nislands, this portion of the analysis was restricted to small islands that\n\nare &lt;50 ha in size.\n The small island category included all 27 of the gull islands and 35\n\nof the nongull islands.\n One of the gull islands ( White Shingle) was omitted from the\n\ncomparison because its flora contained only eight species. \n\n  The relationship between species number and island size was\n\ninvestigated for (  i  ) gull islands, (  ii  ) small\n\nnongull islands, and (  iii  ) all nongull islands.\n Linear regressions were conducted using several transformations of\n\n S  ( number of species) and  A  ( island area in hec <l>\n\ntares), which gave equations of the following forms:[ 1] log  S\n\n = z log  A  +  k   1  i.e.,  S  =\n\n c   A  z  , and where  k   1  = log\n\n c  [ 2]  S  =  z  log  A  +  k \n\n 1  [ 3]  S  =  z  log (  A  + 1) + \n\nk   1  [ 4]  S  =  z  log (  A  +\n\n10) +  k   1  .\n Equations 1 and 2 are the power function and exponential model,\n\nrespectively, that have both been commonly used in regression analyses\n\nof species - area relationships ( Connor and McCoy 1979).\n Equations 3 and 4 were used in the attempt to more adequately\n\nlinearize the relationship between species number and area in the exponential\n\nmodel. \n\n  ( distance to\n\nmainland measured in kilometres), on species number was also examined by\n\nmultiple linear regression.\n\n\n2  x  D  , were used (  k   2  is a\n\nconstant). \n\n\n\n  The combined floras of the 62 small islands with areas of &lt;50\n\nha consist of 591 species, including 115 aliens ( 19%), 68 annuals ( 12%),\n\nand 45 biennials ( 8%).\n Of the alien species, 32 ( 28%) are annuals, 21 ( 18%) are biennials,\n\nwhile the remaining 62 ( 54%) are perennials.\n Table 1 gives the number of species, area, distance to mainland,\n\nand percent composition of the floras ( divided into origin and life-history\n\ncharacteristic) for each of these small islands and also for the 15 larger\n\nislands. \n\n  The comparison of floras on the small islands ( Table 2) shows\n\nthat species categorized as either alien or annual are more strongly\n\nrepresented on islands with nesting gull colonies.\n Where these two features coincide the difference is most striking:\n\nthe percentage composition of alien annuals is four times as high on gull\n\nislands ( 8.2%) than on nongull islands ( 2.0%).\n Alien biennials are also strongly favoured on gull islands, but to a\n\nlesser extent ( ratio = 3.0) than alien annuals.\n Alien perennials and native annuals, which each have only one\n\ncharacteristic favoured in gull colonies ( i.e., alien or annual) are both\n\nfavoured on gull islands by a modest and approximately equal amount ( ratio =\n\n1.8).\n The proportion of native biennials is about the same on gull and\n\nnongull islands.\n The percentage of native perennials ( which lack both of the favoured\n\ncharacteristics for gull islands) was significantly greater on nongull\n\nislands ( 83%) than on gull islands ( 64%). \n\n\n\n\n  Linear regressions of species richness in relation to island size\n\nare given in Table 3.\n For each of the four equations used, the slope of the species - area\n\ncurve (  z  ) was significantly greater for gull islands ( size\n\nrange of 0.2 - 39 ha) than for small nongull islands with a similar size\n\nrange ( 0.4 - 44 ha) ( Fig. 2).\n When the analysis was expanded to include large nongull islands\n\n( up to 4970 ha), the difference in  z  between gull and nongull\n\nislands remained significant using [ 1] and [ 4], but was not significant\n\nusing [ 2] and [ 3].', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '86e52635-0caf-4b34-b72a-4a70513ce9f8', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.784454+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9327918291091919, 'non_english_score': 0.0672081708908081}

Canada T6H 3S5  \n\n\n\n  Three distinct volcanic-ash layers were identified in peat\n\ndeposits through visual, microscopic, and chemical means.\n 14\n\n C dating of 34 peat samples.\n The upper layer was probably Bridge River ash, deposited about 2350\n\nyears BP.\n The middle layer was possibly St. Helens Y tephra, deposited around\n\n3400 years BP.\n The lower ash was related to Mazama tephra, deposited about 6600\n\nyears BP.\n Ash-enriched layers were formed in the accumulating peat as aerial\n\ndeposition of tephra occurred, often for several hundred years before and\n\nafter the presumed main eruption, as shown by  14  C dates and peat\n\naccumulation rates.\n This implies periodic eruptions by the volcanoes, not all of which\n\nproduced distinct ash layers in areas distant from the source.\n Redeposition from wind-eroded beds of Mazama ash during the dry\n\npostglacial climatic maximum is a possibility.  \n\n\n\n  The widespread occurrence of volcanic ash in western North\n\nAmerica is well documented ( Powers and Wilcox 1964: Westgate and\n\nDreimanis 1967).\n Late Quaternary volcanic-ash beds have been associated with Glacier\n\nPeak in Washington, Mount Mazama in Oregon ( Powers and Wilcox 1964), Mount\n\nSt. Helens in Washington, Plinth-Meager Mountain area near Bridge River in\n\nBritish Columbia ( Valentine  et al  . 1987), and Mount Bona in the\n\nSt. Elias Range in Alaska ( Lerbekmo and Campbell 1969). \n\n  The particle size and abundance of tephra diminish with distance\n\nfrom the source volcano.\n Alberta is hundreds of kilometres from the sources; hence only\n\nlimited amounts of fine-grained tephra can be found.\n The distribution of the tephra is often limited to narrow plumes,\n\ndetermined by the prevailing winds at the time of the eruptions.\n Close to the source continuous volcanic ash mantles the entire\n\nlandscape, but in Alberta the ash layers are discontinuous, often concen <l>\n\ntrated by secondary deposition in areas sheltered from the wind.\n Peatlands are particularly suited for the study of volcanic-ash\n\ndeposition.\n The peatland surfaces are wet and well vegetated, trapping the\n\natmospherically deposited tephra.\n Furthermore, light amounts of volcanic ashfall do not kill the\n\nvegetation and a continuous record of ash enrichment is preserved in the\n\naccumulating peat. \n\n  Peat bogs have long been used by researchers to reveal the\n\npresence of one or more volcanic-ash layers ( Hansen 1949; Fryxell 1965;\n\nWestgate  et al  . 1969).\n Not only are the ash layers well preserved in this quiescent\n\ndepositional environment ( Westgate  et al  . 1970), but also\n\nthe peat enveloping the tephra layers provides a ready source of carbon for\n\n 14  C analyses. \n\n  In central Alberta, over 500 km from the nearest of the tephra\n\nsources, the volcanic-ash layers can be very thin ( 1-2 mm) and barely\n\nvisible with the naked eye ( Westgate  et al  . 1969;\n\nLichti-Federovich 1970).\n Under the microscope, however, additional volcanic-ash-enriched\n\nlayers that are otherwise invisible to the unaided eye may become evident.\n In this paper the occurrences of both visible and nonvisible\n\nvolcanic-ash layers are presented and their possible source is discussed on\n\nthe basis of radiocarbon dates. \n\n\n  During 1981, 1984, and 1986 a total of 76 peatlands were cored in\n\nAlberta and adjoining Saskatchewan, generally north of the North Saskatchewan\n\nRiver.\n A modified Macaulay peat corer with an inside diameter of 34 mm was\n\nused and samples were collected at the surface and at 15 cm intervals.\n In many peatlands more than one core was taken to determine the\n\nphysical, chemical, and floristic variability of the peat deposits.\n A number of samples were taken with a peat profile cutter ( Wardenaar\n\n1987), which extracted 170 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm peat columns.\n .\n\n1975), the main difference being that bogs receive only atmospheric water but\n\nthe fens also receive seepage water. \n\n  In the laboratory the samples were oven dried and then ashed at\n\n480&degree;C.\n The ash was treated with hot nitric and hydrochloric acid, and\n\nthe residue was extracted with hydrochloric acid and filtered.\n The filter paper was burned, and the weight of the residual\n\nacid-insoluble ash was expressed as a percentage of the dry sample.\n The filtrate was analyzed with an inductively coupled argon plasma\n\nspectrometer for Ca, Mg, K, Al, S, P, Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu. Ni, Pb, Ti, and Na.\n the instrument and\n\nsample preparation were reported elsewhere ( Ali  et al  .\n\n1988). \n\n  The volcanic-glass content was determined under a polarizing\n\nmicroscope.\n A small amount of acid-insoluble ash was examined by counting 200\n\ngrains of soil particles, including crystalline and tephra grains.\n The volcanic-glass content was expressed as a percentage of all\n\ncounted particles.\n The morphology of individual tephra grains and the abundance of\n\nvarious forms were noted.\n C dating to\n\nBrock University ( BGS) and to Alberta Environmental Centre Vegreville (\n\nAECV). \n\n\n\n  Volcanic ash was found in 24 of the investigated peatlands.\n The ash deposits can be identified visually where they occur as\n\ndistinct layers, microscopically where the ash is dispersed in a peaty zone,\n\nand chemically through the analysis of some elements. \n\n  Visible volcanic-ash layers occur as distinct white- to\n\nbuff-coloured layers.\n They can be straight and even, or they can be contorted by\n\ndifferential movements in the peat after deposition.\n In many cases the ash layers are discontinuous and have variable\n\nthickness, possibly reflecting the contour of depositional surfaces.\n At an intensively studied site ( site 7) the peat-land was cored on a\n\n200 m grid.\n A visible ash layer was found between 1.5 and 2 m depth at only 6 of\n\nthe 21 cored sites.\n Attempts to relocate an ash layer for further sampling often failed\n\neven when cores were taken only a few centimetres from a core that showed a\n\nclearly visible ash layer.\n On the other hand, at many sites in the western part of the study\n\narea there are two or three parallel volcanic ash layers, separated by up to\n\n10 cm of peat ( Fig. 1). \n\n  Identification of nonvisible volcanic-ash-enriched zones can be\n\naccomplished by the examination of the acid-insoluble peat residue under a\n\npolarizing microscope.\n The individual volcanic-glass shards are usually &lt;20 &mu;m in\n\ndiameter and can be recognized by their noncrystalline structure.\n Their irregular shape distinguishes them from biogenic silicate\n\nmaterials.\n The ash-enriched zones are invariably thicker than the visible ash\n\nlayers, extending both above and below the visible ash.\n Some of these zones are 80 cm thick.\n Nonvisible ash zones could be found more consistently at different\n\nlocations in the same peat-land than visible ash layers.\n At the intensively surveyed site 7 all 21 cores had an ash-enriched\n\nlayer between 1.5 and 2 m. \n\n  The morphology of individual tephra grains consists of three\n\ndistinct types.\n The most common form is thin polygonal plates with straight edges,\n\noften associated with elongated three-sided prisms.\n Such prisms often contain inclusions of minerals or gas.\n This type is informally identified as bubble-wall material.\n The second type is thick, irregular to somewhat elongated grains\n\nthat have large amounts of gas and mineral inclusions.\n This material resembles comminuted pumice.\n The third type is elongated cylindrical shapes that have an oval\n\ncross section ( needles).\n Enclosures of gas are often present as bubble trains elongated along\n\nthe long axis. \n\n  The treatment of ached peat residue with hydrochloric and nitric\n\nacid (  aqua regia  ) removes the readily acid-soluble\n\nminerals leaving resistant minerals, such as quartz and feld  spar, in the residue ( Jackson  et al  .\n\n1986).\n ( silica),\n\nis not dissolved in the acid treatment, as shown by the close relationship\n\nbetween amounts of acid-insoluble ash and volcanic ash ( Fig. 2). \n\n  Volcanic ash is composed of elements that are considerably\n\ndifferent from the components of the peat.\n 3\n\n , with significant amounts of FeO, Na  2  0, CaO, and K  2\n\n O ( Westgate  et al  . 1970).\n is noteworthy.\n magnetites present\n\nin the tephra ( King  et al  . 1982).\n Most of the major elemental constituents occur commonly in peat,\n\noriginating from airborne dust and from water-soluble and biologically\n\ngenerated sources.\n However, it was found that Ti and Al are associated with high levels\n\nof volcanic ash ( Si was not determined) ( Fig. 2).\n Titanium is particularly useful as an indicator because\n\nbackground levels of Ti are low in the study area and the main source is the\n\nvolcanic aerosol. \n\n  The advantage of using microscopic and chemical means to identify\n\nthe nonvisible ash layers is demonstrated in Fig. 2.\n In the upper and middle zone the ash grain count and the Ti and Al\n\nanalyses show distinct peaks, although the acid-insoluble ash is low,\n\npossibly because of the small size and low weight of the volcanic-ash grains.\n At the base of the lower ash zone all indicators show high values,\n\nbut the underlying mineral soil is distinguished by the absence of\n\nvolcanic-ash grains and low Ti values. \n\n  The examination of peat through radiocarbon dating and through\n\nvisual, microscopic, and chemical methods resulted in the identification of\n\nthree distinct volcanic-ash layers and ash-enriched zones.\n In cases where radiocarbon control was not available the tephra was\n\nassigned to an ash zone on the basis of stratigraphic position and tephra\n\nmorphology. \n\n  The depth at which the ash-enriched zones and ash layers occur is\n\nnot constant because of different rates of peat accumulation in\n\ndifferent kinds of wetlands.\n The relative position of the ash-enriched zones within the peat\n\ndeposit is, however, relatively constant, except in anomalous, eroding peat\n\ndeposits such as site 11.\n The base of the upper ash-enriched zone is about a third of the way\n\ndown the peat column, the middle zone is at about the middle of the peat\n\ncolumn, and the lower zone is near the base of the peat column ( Table 1).\n\n\n\n  The upper ash-enriched zone was found at 13 locations in peat\n\ndeposits in the western part of central Alberta ( Fig. 3).\n It had an average thickness of 13 cm ( Table 1).\n Visible ash was relatively rare in this area ( sites 5, 6, and 11;\n\nFig. 3); where present, it was thin and discontinuous ( Kearney and Luckman\n\n1983).\n The ash consists of about equal proportions of pumice and bubble-wall\n\nmaterials, with rare but constant vesicular needle grains. \n\n  At 12 sites in the peatlands of central Alberta the middle\n\nash-enriched zone was found in about the same areas as the upper zone ( Fig.\n\n4).\n The middle zone had an average thickness of 11 cm ( Table 1).\n Visible ash layers were common ( sites 2, 7, 8, 9, and 11; Fig. 4).\n At site 7 three distinct layers could be discerned ( Fig. 1), but the\n\nash generally occurred in a single layer.\n The ash consists primarily of pumice, with much lower proportions of\n\nbubble-wall material. \n\n  The lower ash-enriched zone had the widest distribution in the\n\npeatlands of central Alberta ( Fig. 5).\n It contained one or two visible ash layers in the sites west of\n\nEdmonton, but visible volcanic ash was not detected in the peat to the\n\nnorth-east.\n The ash-enriched zone was thick, averaging 23 cm ( Table 1).\n\n\n\n  C dates are available for samples\n\nfrom 10 peatlands and one lake in central Alberta where the organic deposits\n\nwere directly relevant to the volcanic-ash layers and ash-enriched zones (\n\nTable 2).   \n These dates provide an approximation of the time of visible ash\n\ndeposition and the period during which the ash-enriched layer was deposited.\n However, most of the dates are some centimetres above or below the\n\nash layer, necessitating a projection of the date on the basis of the rate of\n\npeat accumulation.\n By assuming a uniform rate of peat formation, one can calculate the\n\nrate of peat accumulation between a dated section and the surface ( 0 years)\n\nor between two dated sections.\n This rate can then be used to estimate the projected age of any\n\npoint within the peat section.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

Okulitch 1984; Brown  et al  .\n\n1986; Brown and Journeay 1987).\n The décollement was subsequently reactivated by early Tertiary\n\nbrittle normal faulting ( Lane 1984a) related to regional extension, uplift,\n\nand quenching of isotopic systems ( e.g., Mathews 1981, 1983; Parrish  et\n\nal  . 1985; Bardoux1985; Carr  et al  . 1987).\n As an example of a Cordilleran metamorphic core complex (\n\nCrittenden  et al  . 1980; Brown and Read 1983), the Monashee\n\nComplex has been the subject of ongoing debate on the relative importance of\n\nMesozoic shortening versus Tertiary extension in the geologic evolution of\n\nthe region. \n\n \n\nward underthrusting of the deforming Cordilleran orogen by the North American\n\ncraton created a crustal-scale duplex that uplifted and cooled the Monashee\n\nComplex ( Brown  et al  . 1986).\n The Monashee Décollement was interpreted as the roof thrust of\n\nthe duplex, forming primarily as a result of regional shortening of Jurassic\n\nto Cretaceous age.\n Regional uplift and cooling occurred primarily in the Mesozoic\n\nbecause of crustal duplexing, with later reactivation by modest early\n\nTertiary extension and uplift. \n\n  An alternative model was based on data from the Valhalla and\n\nOkanagan complexes in southern British Columbia ( Parrish and Carr 1986;\n\nCarr  et al  . 1987).\n It differed in that the role of well-documented Eocene extension was\n\nemphasized as the mechanism of uplift and cooling of the metamorphic complex.\n\n\n\n  Tertiary extensional faulting of 10 - 15 km magnitude on the\n\nmargins of the Monashee Complex near latitude 51 &degree;N has been\n\ninterpreted previously ( Read and Brown 1981; Lane 1984a; Brown and Journeay\n\n1987).\n Recent models of major Tertiary extension across the Okanagan Complex\n\nin southern British Columbia suggest extension by as much as 60 - 100 km,\n\naccommodated by ductile shearing at depth and brittle faulting at higher\n\nstructural levels ( Tempelman-Kluit and Parkinson 1986; Parrish and Carr\n\n1986; but see Okulitch 1987).\n These models either imply that a similar magnitude of extension\n\noccurred on the Monashee Décollement and Columbia River fault\n\nzone or require a rapid decrease in extension magnitude northward along\n\nstrike. \n\n  The recognition of important Tertiary extension in southern\n\nBritish Columbia results in part from precise dating of synkinematic\n\nmagmatism, which is widespread in the Okanagan and Valhalla complexes.\n The magmatism is spatially, and perhaps genetically, related to major\n\nextension ( e.g., Mathews 1981; Carr  et al  . 1987).\n Conversely, the timing of displacements along the Monashee\n\nDécollement is relatively poorly constrained, correlative with a lack\n\nof important synkinematic plutonism.\n A different approach is therefore required to answer the questions of\n\nwhen and under what conditions Mesozoic shortening was replaced by Tertiary\n\nextension. \n\n  This paper begins to address those questions by documenting\n\nthe microstructures, metamorphic-mineral assemblages, and pressure -\n\ntemperature (  P - T  ) conditions as preserved in metasediments at\n\nthe Revelstoke damsite.\n During construction of the dam across the Columbia River valley, the\n\neffects of ductile shearing and brittle faulting on the Monashee\n\nDécollement and Columbia River fault zone were temporarily well\n\nexposed.\n We elaborate on earlier microstructural evidence for top-to-the-east\n\nsense of shear on the décollement north of Revelstoke ( see Brown and\n\nMurphy 1982) by documenting multiple kinematic criteria that are consistent\n\nover 50 km of strike length.\n The microstructural and metamorphic data are then compared with the\n\nlocal cooling history.\n From these data we evaluate the extent to which the relative\n\nimportance of Mesozoic compression and Tertiary extension can be con <l>\n\nstrained. \n\n\n  Development of the orogen began in the Jurassic with the collapse\n\nof a marginal basin and obduction of a magmatic arc.\n Middle Jurassic west-verging deformation shortened and thickened the\n\ncontinental-margin sedimentary prism, resulting in regional metamorphism.\n That was followed by westward underthrusting of the thickened\n\nmetasedimentary pile by the North American cratonic basement and the\n\nformation of a crustal-scale duplex in Late Jurassic through Cretaceous time.\n Early Tertiary extension later modified the compressional orogen (\n\nsee Brown  et al.  ( 1986) for a comprehensive treatment).   \n\n  The Monashee Complex ( Fig. 1) is exposed as a tectonic window\n\nthrough the overlying Selkirk Allochthon ( Read and Brown 1981; Brown and\n\nJourneay 1987).\n Structural geometry in the hanging wall is complex as a result of\n\npolyphase deformation ( e.g., Brown and Tippett 1978; Raeside and Simony\n\n1983; Brown and Lane 1988).\n The structural geometry in the footwall Monashee Complex is also\n\ncomplex ( Read and Klepacki 1981; H&ouml;y and Brown 1980; Journeay 1986),\n\nbut neither structures nor metamorphism can be directly correlated\n\nacross the Monashee Décollement to the Selkirk Allochthon ( Wheeler\n\n1965; Okulitch 1984; Journeay 1986). \n\n  On the west side of the complex, where the décollement\n\ndips shallowly westward, two periods of ductile thrusting ( west over east)\n\nwere interpreted as Late Jurassic and Late Cretaceous to Paleocene in\n\nage ( Journeay 1986).  \n Ductile and brittle west-side-down normal faulting of presumed Eocene\n\nage reactivated the earlier mylonite zones in an extensional mode ( Brown and\n\nJourneay 1987).\n The transition from contraction to extension is marked on the west\n\nmargin of the complex by a vergence reversal in the shear zones ( Brown and\n\nJourneay 1987). \n\n  Because west and east margins are contiguous around the north end\n\nof the complex ( Fig. 1), there must have been a contractional history\n\non the east margin.\n However, the contractional and extensional parts of the history\n\nhave never been distinguished because the kinematics are the same for both.\n Although brittle extensional faulting on the Columbia River Fault is\n\nunequivocally early Tertiary in age ( Lane 1984  b  ) , the question\n\nof how much, if any, of the ductile fabric relates to Tertiary shearing (\n\ncontractional or extensional) has not yet been addressed. \n\n\n\n  Detailed studies at several localities along the mylonite zone\n\nindicate a consistent, broadly east-west mylonitic extension lineation and\n\nshallow eastward- or northward-dipping mylonitic foliation ( Fig. 2)   .\n Foliations axial planar to Middle Jurassic southwest-verging folds in\n\nthe hanging wall ( S  2  ) and variably oriented lineations ( L \n\n2  ) parallel to hinge lines are progressively reoriented toward the\n\nmylonitic fabrics ( S  m  , L  m  ) in the\n\ndécollement ( Fig. 2).\n Variability of the mylonitic foliation reflects syn-mylonite folding\n\n( Fig. 3).\n Hinges of tight to isoclinal syn-mylonite ductile minor folds at the\n\nRevelstoke damsite form two clusters adjacent to the southeast-trending\n\nmylonitic extension lineation when plotted on an equal-area stereographic\n\nprojection ( Fig. 3  a  ) .\n Hinges trending easterly have Z shapes viewed down-plunge and those\n\ntrending southerly have S shapes, indicating a local southeastward dis <l>\n\nplacement of the hanging wall. \n\n  Later folds, which probably represent a late increment of the\n\nductile shearing, locally rotated the mylonitic foliation and lineation.\n Such folds are well exposed in metasediments at the damsite ( Fig.\n\n4).\n Axial-surface orientations are highly variable, but hinges\n\nplunge shallowly towards the east or northeast ( Fig. 3  b  ) .\n A weak crenulation of micas is locally observed parallel to the fold\n\nhinges but at an angle to the mylonitic stretching lineation, particularly\n\nnear hinge zones.\n The late structures refold earlier structures but are usually\n\ndistinguishable from the earlier folds by their more open form (\n\ninterlimb angles near 90&degree;) and by their round hinge zones ( Lane 1984\n\n a  , Fig. 7).\n The folds described here are disrupted and offset by the brittle\n\nextensional-fault zone ( Lane 1984  a  ) . \n\n  The late-stage folds are relative time markers because they\n\ndeform mylonitic textures in the quartzite units, unlike the earlier tight to\n\nisoclinal minor folds where the

apart parallel to the lineation ( Figs. 7  b  - 7  b\n\n ) .\n In siliceous layers the extension lineation is usually defined by\n\ndismembered porphyroclasts or aggregates of plagioclase and

King  et al  . 1968; Layne 1969;\n\nLayne and Ehrhart 1970; Wolff  et al  . 1983; Wolff 1985; Wolff and\n\nDurr 1986), but only a few behavioral studies ( Sullivan 1977; Halpin and\n\nSullivan 1978; Halpin 1981) have compared adjacent insular and mainland\n\nconspecific populations. \n\n  In the laboratory, we compared activity and climbing behavior,\n\nincluding nest height preference, in   P. maniculatus \n\n from Isle Haute in the Bay of Fundy and from adjacent main <l>\n\nland Nova Scotia.\n species, including\n\n  P. maniculatus   , appear morphologically and\n\nbehaviorally adapted to a semiarboreal existence ( Horner 1954; Taylor and\n\nMcCarley 1963; King  et al  . 1968; Klein and Layne 1978; Tadlock\n\nand Klein 1979; Dewsbury  et al  . 1980; Newton  et al  .\n\n1980; Stah 1980; Harney 1983).\n These adaptations are usually related to habitat structure ( Meserve\n\n1976) or to selective pressures from ground-dwelling predators ( Foster\n\n1965) or competitors ( M\'Closkey 1976; Holbrook 1978, 1979; Newton \n\net al  . 1980; Harney 1983).\n Since habitats of the mainland and island populations in our study\n\nwere structurally similar, differences in arboreality or locomotor behavior\n\nbetween the two groups would likely reflect differences in predation or\n\ninterspecific competition, or random change, between the two locations. \n\n \n\nland populations could reflect genetic differences ( selection pressures,\n\norigin, or drift) or differences in experience.\n To separate the evolutionary and genetic components of these\n\nbehaviors, we compared the behavior of wild-caught and captive-born mice from\n\nthe two populations.\n We predicted that island mice, relative to mainland mice, would be (\n\n i  ) more active and less evasive of open space, (  ii  )\n\nless arboreal, and (  iii  ) less likely to construct aboveground\n\nnests. \n\n\n  Deer mice were collected from Isle Haute, an isolated island\n\nplateau in the upper Bay of Fundy ( 45&degree;15\'N, 65&degree;00\'W), and on\n\nthe mainland in Cumberland and Colchester counties, Nova Scotia (\n\n45&degree;20\' - 45&degree;50\'N, 63&degree;50\' - 64&degree;55\'W).\n Isle Haute is similar topographically and vegetatively to the\n\nmainland study areas ( Rowe 1972), but lacks the mainland complement of\n\nterrestrial quadrupedal predators and interspecific competitors.\n is the only\n\nterrestrial mammal resident on the island.\n Extensive divergence in cranial morphometry between Isle Haute and\n\nmainland populations indicates long-term isolation of the island populations\n\n( Colquohoun 1983). \n\n \n\n at Acadia University included wild-caught and first-generation\n\ncaptive-born mice from both study areas.\n The colony was established in 1980 and until 1984 was supplemented\n\nannually with wild-caught mice.\n Few litters were conceived in the laboratory.\n Rather, females that were pregnant when captured bore their young in\n\ncaptivity. \n\n \n\nstyrene cages with stainless steel lids.\n Cage floors were covered with wood shavings, and nonabsorbent cotton\n\nwas supplied for nesting material.\n Laboratory chow, sunflower seeds, and water were provided\n\n  ad libitum   .\n Cages were kept in a vivarium at 17&degree;C with photo-period set at\n\n16L:8D. \n\n  Two sets of experiments, climbing trials and nest height\n\nselection, were conducted within an indoor observation room measuring 2.8 x\n\n1.6 x 2.4 m.  \n The observation room floor was gridded into 28 ( 4 x 7) 40-cm squares\n\nand was lightly covered with moistened leaves or wood shavings.\n Individuals were observed through a 58 x 44 cm window of one-way\n\nglass.\n The observation area was illuminated by three 40-W incandescent red\n\nlights.\n During each trial, fresh water and sunflower seeds were provided\n\n  ad libitum   .\n After each trial, the observation room and furnishings were cleaned\n\nwith soap and hot water ( 70&degree;C) before new litter was applied to the\n\nfloor. \n\n  In each group ( i.e., Isle Haute wild-caught and captive-born,\n\nmainland wild-caught and captive-born), adult mice were randomly chosen\n\nfor both experiments from a pool in which most males were nonscrotal and\n\nfemales were not pregnant or lactating.\n In each experiment mice were used only once; however, most mice\n\nwere used for both experiments. \n\n  Climbing trials were conducted at least 2 h after " sunset" and\n\nnot later than 2 h before " sunrise."\n An expanding wooden clothes rack was placed in the center of the\n\nobservation area to serve as a climbing structure ( Fig. 1).\n This " tree" ( 64 x 50 x 100 cm, outside dimensions) consisted\n\nof a series of horizontal and diagonal rungs that progressed vertically.\n Horizontals occurred at levels 25, 47, 73, and 100 cm above the\n\nfloor.\n , a waterproof\n\npreservative, for ease of cleaning.\n Mice were placed singly inside the observation room and were observed\n\nfor 30 min ( three consecutive 10-min periods).\n Total ground locomotor activity, i.e., number of squares travelled\n\nper unit time ( ACT ) , number of climbing encounters, i.e., all physical\n\ncontacts with the tree that resulted in a climb ( CLIMB ) , total climbing\n\ntime ( seconds) on tree ( TIME ) , and number of nonclimbing encounters,\n\ni.e., olfactory encounters or physical contacts not resulting in a climb (\n\nNCLIMB) were recorded on audio tape and later transcribed.\n Total number of encounters ( ENCT = CLIMB + NCLIMB), climbing time\n\nper climbing encounter ( T / CLIMB), ratio of climbing encounters to\n\nnonclimbing encounters ( CLRAT ) , and thigmotaxis or wall-seeking tendency (\n\nWSEEK = ACT / ENCT ) were then calculated. \n\n  For the nest height selection experiment, three equally spaced\n\nnest boxes were set on a raised platform ( 135 x 14 x 2 cm) located in the\n\ntree 90 cm above the floor.\n Three additional nest boxes were placed on the floor directly below\n\nthe elevated nest sites, with a seventh box placed away from the tree in the\n\nmiddle of the floor.\n The modified tree was placed at one end of the observation room\n\nopposite the food and water ( Fig. 2). \n\n  Nest boxes were constructed from 13-mm plywood and measured 10 x\n\n10 x 10 cm inside, with a removable lid and a 2.5-cm entrance-exit hole in a\n\nlower right quadrant of one of the sides.  \n ( R)\n\n .\n Before each trial, all nest boxes contained an equal amount of fresh\n\nnonabsorbent cotton for bedding. \n\n  To reduce the chances of deer mice selecting specific nest boxes\n\nbecause of cues other than nest location, the seven nest boxes for each trial\n\nwere randomly chosen from a pool of nine and were randomly positioned on the\n\ntree. \n\n  Mice were chosen randomly and placed singly inside the observa\n\n<l> tion room approximately 2 h before " sunrise" and left for 6 - 8 hours.\n Each nest box was then examined for disturbance and presence or\n\nabsence of a nest and ( or) mouse.\n All materials, including the tree, were thoroughly cleaned before the\n\nnext trial. \n\n  Results were analyzed nonparametrically.\n Spearman rank order correlations between each behavioral variable and\n\nthe number of days in captivity were computed to test for the effects of\n\nprolonged captivity on behavior.\n Friedman two-way analysis of variance ( 10-min blocks) was used to\n\ndetect any changes in behavior over the 30-min period.\n Nesting preferences were analyzed with single classification goodness\n\nof fit tests ( Sokal and Rohlf 1969).\n All other comparisons within and between groups were made with\n\nMann-Whitney  U  - tests. \n\n\n\n  One hundred and four ( with 21 mainland wild-caught, 32 island\n\nwild-caught, 32 mainland captive-born, and 19 island captive-born mice)\n\n30-min climbing trials were performed.\n Although the median number of captive days for wild-caught mice was\n\nsignificantly greater in island (  M  = 59.5) than in mainland (\n\n M  = 24.5) groups (  U  = 230,  p  = 0.04), the\n\nfrequency distributions of time in captivity were similar for both areas\n\n(  G  = 1.56,  p  &gt; 0.1).\n Total number of tree encounters ( ENCT ) , total climbing time ( TIME )\n\n, wall-seeking tendency ( WSEEK ) , and climbing time per climbing encounter\n\n( T / CLIMB ) were not significantly affected by prolonged captivity in mice\n\nfrom either location.\n Ground locomotor activity ( ACT ) , ratio of climbing encounters to\n\nnonclimbing encounters ( CLRAT ) , and total number of climbing encounters (\n\nCLIMB ) decreased significantly with extended captivity in the island\n\npopulation.\n In mainland wild-caught deer mice, only the number of non-climbing\n\nencounters ( NCLIMB ) decreased significantly over a 270-day period ( Table\n\n1).\n With the exception of nonclimbing encounters ( Table 2), no\n\nsignificant differences between sexes were found within groups. \n\n  Both wild-caught and captive-born deer mice from Isle Haute\n\nencountered and climbed the tree significantly more often than did their\n\nmainland counterparts.\n However, both mainland groups spent significantly more time on the\n\ntree per climbing encounter ( Table 2).\n Ground locomotor activity did not differ in the two wild-caught\n\ngroups, but in captive-born groups it was significantly higher in island mice\n\nthan in mainland mice ( Table 2).\n As well, mainland groups engaged in wall-seeking behavior\n\nsignificantly more than did island groups ( Table 2).\n The number of nonclimbing encounters was significantly higher in Isle\n\nHaute mice ( males and females) than in mainland males, but not females (\n\nTable 2).\n Total climbing time and the ratio of climbing to nonclimbing\n\nencounters were similar in island and mainland wild-caught groups. \n\n  In Isle Haute mice, ground locomotor activity and number of\n\nnonclimbing tree encounters were significantly greater in captive-born than\n\nin wild-caught animals ( Table 3).\n The number of climbing encounters and the ratio of climbing to\n\nnon-climbing encounters were significantly greater in wild-caught mice.\n However, total climbing time and climbing time per climbing encounter\n\ndid not differ significantly between these groups.\n The tendency to seek the wall was also similar in the two groups (\n\nTable 3). \n\n  In mainland deer mice as well, the number of climbs and ratio of\n\nclimbing to nonclimbing encounters were significantly greater in wild-caught\n\nthan in captive-born animals, but the time per climb was significantly less (\n\nTable 3). \n\n  Although the pattern of change in behaviors during the 30-min\n\ntrials varied slightly, for most behaviors it was similar in mice from both\n\nlocations ( Table 4).\n Birthplace had less effect on the pattern of responses of mainland\n\ndeer mice during the 30-min trial than on the pattern in island deer\n\nmice.\n Although wall-seeking tendency remained constant, ground locomotor\n\nactivity decreased significantly for all groups during the 30-min trial.\n Total number of encounters and total non-climbing encounters\n\ndecreased significantly during the trials in all wild-caught groups.\n In captive-born groups total number of encounters decreased in island\n\nanimals but not in mainland animals; nonclimbing encounters decreased in\n\nmainland animals and island females but not island males.\n Total climbing encounters and the ratio of climbing to nonclimbing\n\nencounters remained constant within all groups except wild-caught island\n\nmice, which experienced significant decreases in both of these behaviors.\n Total climbing time increased significantly in wild-caught island and\n\ncaptive-born mainland mice.\n As well, climbing time per climbing encounter increased in all groups\n\nexcept captive-born island mice ( Table 4). \n\n\n  One hundred and thirty-nine wild-caught ( 19 mainland, 34 Isle\n\nHaute) and captive-born ( 56 mainland, 30 Isle Haute) adult deer mice were\n\ntested for preference for elevated or ground-level nest sites.\n In every trial all nest boxes were explored, as evidenced by soiled\n\nor disturbed cotton.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '10814b07-b06b-4749-8262-ffa740239613', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.788398+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9494779109954834, 'non_english_score': 0.0505220890045166}

Zool.  67  : 872 - 883.\n\n\n\n  The diving patterns of 10 adult female California sea lions (\n\n  Zalophus californianus   ) were examined during\n\nthe summer breeding season on San Miguel Island, California, in 1982 and 1983\n\nusing time-depth recorders.\n During 17 feeding trips, representing 40.6 days at sea, animals made\n\nover 8900 dives, the deepest of which was estimated at 274 m, while the\n\nlongest was 9.9 min.\n The majority of dives, however, were less than 3 min in duration and\n\n80 m in depth.\n From estimates of body oxygen stores, we predict that dives up to 5.8\n\nmin can be supported aerobically.\n Therefore, cost-benefit considerations based on prey availability and\n\nencounter rate may be more important than physiological limits in shaping the\n\nforaging patterns of   Zalophus   .\n Sea lions were active virtually throughout their time at sea, resting\n\non the surface for only 3% of the average trip.\n Peak diving frequency occurred during the twilight hours near sunrise\n\nand sunset.\n Dives were frequent, however, during all hours of the day and were\n\ntypically clustered into bouts that lasted a mean ( \n\nSD) of 3.3  1.5 h.\n We suggest that these bouts represent active feeding on discrete prey\n\npatches.\n During short bouts ( &lt;3 h), dive depth was less variable than for\n\ndives occurring between bouts.\n During longer bouts, dive depth changed in a manner consistent with\n\npursuit of vertically migrating prey.\n During the 1983 El Ni&ntilde;o, sea lions compensated for a reduction\n\nin food availability by lengthening dive bouts.\n These seasonal and diel variations in diving patterns suggest that\n\nthe rate of prey encounter strongly influences the depth and duration of\n\nindividual dives.  \n\n\n  Unlike terrestrial predators, the foraging activities of aquatic\n\nmammals take place during breath hold.\n Feeding depths and time available for search, pursuit, and prey\n\ncapture are limited by oxygen stores available upon submergence.\n These constraints undoubtedly influence the decision rules used by\n\naquatic predators in locating and pursuing prey.\n However, physiological limits to breath hold may not be the most\n\nimportant factor shaping the diving patterns of foraging marine mammals.\n Instead, energetic cost-benefit considerations based on prey\n\navailability and encounter rates may have a more pronounced effect.\n Recent data indicate that many fur seal species rarely approach the\n\ncalculated limits of dive depth and duration ( Gentry et al. 1986  a\n\n ) .\n Their dives are normally shallow and of short duration.\n Consistent, diel variations in dive patterns also suggest that prey\n\navailability and location strongly influence the depth and duration of\n\nindividual dives.\n Within absolute physiological limits, there may be considerable\n\nflexibility in the ways that marine mammals find and pursue prey. \n\n  Theoretical treatments of foraging by terrestrial predators have\n\ndescribed a number of alternative strategies that animals in different\n\nhabitats should use to maximize their net rate of energy intake ( Schoener\n\n1971; Pyke et al. 1977; Krebs 1978; Orians and Pearson 1979).\n\n\na  , 1979  b  ) have addressed the question of foraging\n\noptimization.\n They investigated the trade-off between the benefits of continued\n\nsearch and the cost of losing the prey because of oxygen depletion during\n\npursuit by the mink (   Mustela vison   ) .  \n The results of these studies demonstrated that search and pursuit\n\ntimes were negatively correlated, but that oxygen limits accounted for\n\nconsiderably less of the variation in hunting patterns than did optimal forag\n\n<l> ing considerations based on prey encounter rates. \n\n  Empirical evidence of the interactions between marine mammals and\n\ntheir prey, which might be used to test predictions of optimal\n\nbreath-hold foraging, is lacking.\n Recent advances in recording instruments, however, now permit the\n\ncollection of data on the behavior of foraging animals.\n\n\ncies is now available and provides a basis with which to compare their\n\ndiving and feeding patterns ( Kooyman 1981; Kooyman et al. 1982; Nagy et al.\n\n1984; Croxall et al. 1985; Gentry et al. 1986  a  ; Le Boeuf et al.\n\n1988).\n Constraints imposed by an animal's physiology, morphology, and\n\nhabitat and the energetic decision rules common to aquatic predators can be\n\nclarified by these comparisons. \n\n  Zalophus californianus\n\n  ) is an ideal subject for studies of diving behavior.\n Its large size provides an interesting comparison to previous studies\n\nof smaller fur seals ( Gentry et al. 1986  a  ) .\n Like other otariid pinnipeds, sea lions make repeated trips to sea\n\nduring the breeding season, returning each time to suckle their pups.\n This enables the deployment and retrieval of dive recorders.\n Because they must return with sufficient energy to nourish their pups\n\nduring their brief onshore fast, there is no doubt that feeding occurs during\n\nthese offshore periods ( Costa 1986). \n\n  In this study, we examined the diving patterns of female sea\n\nlions during these foraging trips.\n Although no information was obtained on prey availability, inferences\n\nbased on optimal foraging predictions were made as to the factors that might\n\ninfluence the observed behavior.\n Average dive durations were compared with predicted values to assess\n\nthe effects of oxygen limitations on feeding patterns.\n Comparisons with other species, for which similar data are\n\navailable, give insights into the foraging constraints imposed by the\n\nenvironment and those that reflect functional limits. \n\n\n  This study was conducted at San Miguel Island, California (\n\n34&degree;N; 120&degree;25'W).\n Time-depth recorders ( TDRs) were deployed on nine lactating, adult\n\nCalifornia sea lions between mid-July and mid-August 1982, and on five\n\nanimals during mid-July 1983. \n\n  The TDR is a 500-g mechanical device that records, in real time,\n\nthe depth and duration of every dive an animal makes over a 2-week period.\n A complete description of this 5 x 20 cm instrument is given by\n\nKooyman et al. ( 1983) and Gentry and Kooyman ( 1986).\n Dives, along with time marks are recorded on photographic film by a\n\nlight-emitting diode ( LED) mounted on a movable, pressure sensitive bourdon\n\ntube.\n Only dives greater than 10 m in depth and 30 s in duration can\n\nbe resolved.\n Before deployment and after recovery, all TDRs were calibrated to a\n\nmaximum depth of 207 m using a portable pressure station. \n\n  The appearance of the LED trace can also provide an indirect\n\nmeasure of activity ( Gentry and Kooyman 1986).\n Along with dives that appear as pointed traces on the film, the\n\nbaseline ( recorded when the animal is on the surface) may be either broad\n\nand wavy, or narrow and flat ( Fig. 1).\n A broad baseline is caused by movement or chatter of the bourdon tube\n\narm, and we interpret this trace to indicate surface swimming.\n Similarly, we interpret a flat baseline as representing inactivity of\n\nthe animal or its resting on the surface.\n From these images a time budget of the animal's activities at sea can\n\nbe constructed ( Fig. 1). \n\n  Sea lions that were observed nursing a pup were captured with\n\nhoop nets and physically immobilized using a large restraint board with a\n\ndetachable neck brace ( Gentry and Holt 1982).\n TDRs were fastened to each animal with a harness constructed from\n\nstraps of 2.5 cm wide tubular nylon webbing ( Gentry and Kooyman 1986).\n A very high frequency ( VHF) radio transmitter ( 5 cm length x 2 cm\n\ndiameter; Advanced Telemetry Systems) was also attached to the harness\n\nto facilitate locating the animal on shore.\n When animals returned from sea they were recaptured, the TDR removed,\n\nand the animal released. \n\n\n  Upon recovery, the film was developed and enlarged.\n Dive traces and timing marks were digitized and printouts obtained of\n\nthe time each dive occurred, its depth, duration, and length of the following\n\nsurface interval ( Gentry and Kooyman 1986).\n During analysis, it became clear that dives occurred in clusters,\n\nseparated by comparatively long surface intervals.\n To analyze these dive bouts, we established their ending points\n\nin time using a bout-ending criterion ( BEC) that was determined by\n\nconstructing surface interval - survivorship curves ( Gentry and Kooyman\n\n1986).\n For each animal, the number of post-dive surface intervals with a\n\nduration greater than a given time  t  was plotted logarithmically\n\nagainst  t  on the ordinate ( Fig. 2).\n This formed a decreasing function with a slope proportional to the\n\nprobability of a surface interval of given duration occurring at any time\n\nafter the last surface interval recorded ( Fagen and Young 1978).\n A break in the slope, therefore, signifies a change in the\n\nprobability of surface interval occurrence. \n\n  For each animal two inflection points were observed: one at 2 to\n\n3 min and the other between 7 and 11 min ( Fig. 2).\n Following the procedures outlined in Gentry and Kooyman ( 1986), the\n\nsecond point was chosen to represent the BEC.\n To further define a bout, the minimum number of dives was\n\narbitrarily set at 10.\n A dive bout, therefore, consisted of 10 or more dives not\n\nseparated by a surface period exceeding the BEC. \n\n  Dive bouts were analyzed separately for mean dive depth,\n\nduration, and surface interval length.\n Interbout intervals were calculated as time from the last dive in a\n\nbout until the first dive of the next.\n Transit times to and from the feeding grounds were established by\n\ncalculating the time from shore departure to the first dive bout and that\n\nspent in returning to land from the last dive bout. \n\n  Activity budgets were constructed from records with clear swim\n\n<l> ming and resting traces.\n Time spent swimming was determined as all surface activity excluding\n\nresting and time spent on the surface between dives occurring within bouts.\n During a dive bout, surface intervals between dives were generally\n\nbrief and likely did not indicate travel, but instead were associated\n\nwith replenishing 0  2  stores.\n Time spent diving was calculated as the total time that the animal\n\nwas submerged.\n Sea lions were considered resting when the dive trace appeared flat (\n\nFig. 1). \n\n  To calculate distance travelled from the amount of time spent\n\nswimming, estimates were made of both swim speed and the instrument's\n\nhydrodynamic impact ( Appendix).\n These calculations indicate that adult sea lions should travel at an\n\naverage velocity of 2.5 m/s ( 9 km/h) when carrying the TDR package.\n Empirical data collected on other otariid species of differing body\n\nsize, however, suggest that this value may be slightly high owing to the\n\nassumption of similar relative transport costs between juveniles and adults (\n\nP.

Ponganis, personal communication).\n The average velocity of 9 km/h should therefore be viewed as\n\napproximate and the calculated foraging ranges regarded as maximum estimates.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nment package.\n One TDR failed, so that eight diving records were obtained ( ZC-5\n\nthrough ZC-12).\n In 1983, only two of the five animals returned to the study site (\n\nZC-17 and ZC-20).\n A total of 10 dive records was therefore obtained from individual\n\nanimals.\n Because several of the animals made more than one trip to sea prior\n\nto recapture, a total of 17 feeding trips was recorded ( Table 1).\n On 6 of these, film in the TDR ran out while the animal was still at\n\nsea.\n\n\n  Since all animals carried radio tags, it was possible to tell\n\nwhen they returned to San Miguel Island.\n However, records clearly showed that two animals ( ZC-10 and ZC-17)\n\nwere on land for periods ranging from 12 to 33 h although they did not return\n\nto the study site.\n Nevertheless, because offshore rocks and other islands occur near San\n\nMiguel, these onshore periods are taken to represent the end of a trip to\n\nsea. \n\n\n  Over 8900 dives were logged in 40.6 recorded days at sea.\n The trace of the deepest dive, although completely recorded on the\n\nfilm, exceeded the calibration of the instrument and was estimated at 274 m (\n\nZC-9; Table 1) by assuming a linear correlation between pressure and the\n\ndistance travelled by the recording arm.", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '7cb27ce3-91f2-4ba6-b641-d603044f6696', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.789651+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9570326209068298, 'non_english_score': 0.042967379093170166}

(  ii  ) the application of search\n\ntechniques; (  iii  ) support for heuristic analysis; (  iv\n\n ) a limited capacity to infer " new knowledge" from existing knowledge;\n\n(  v  ) symbolic processing; and (  vi  ) an ability to\n\nexplain its own reasoning. \n\n  Knowledge-based systems are finding their place in the field of\n\nwater resources engineering with all the dangers of being oversold or     misused    .\n Recent publications by Ortolano and Steinemann ( 1987) and Simonovic\n\nand Savic ( 1989) present a survey of expert systems in environmental and\n\nwater resources engineering, respectively.\n The following paragraph briefly summarizes the review of Simonovic\n\nand Savic ( 1989) because of its relevance to this paper. \n\n  The roles of water resources engineering and the science of\n\nhydrology have expanded beyond the traditional concepts of design and\n\nsynthesis to a large multidisciplinary function serving a broad social\n\nenvironment.\n Development, in time, of these fields follows three basic phases: (\n\n i  ) construction ( emphasis on the design and construction); (\n\n ii  ) planning ( emphasis on the examination of wider range of\n\nalternatives); and (  iii  ) operation and maintenance ( emphasis on\n\nthe careful management of existing projects).\n This has created a pressing need for an overall review of engineering\n\neducation with the main accent on its increased multidisciplinary character,\n\nsupported by the available knowledge base and experience ( Simonovic 1989b).\n\n\n\n  Since their first introduction to the field of water resources in\n\nthe early 1980\'s, expert systems have been used in design, planning, and\n\noperation.\n water resources\n\ndesign  .\n HYSIZE and its simple modification HYSTOR are expert systems for\n\ndetermining the optimum layout for a particular hydroelectric site.\n These systems are able to rank alternatives in order of economic\n\npriority and to test the sensitivity of assumed variables ( Dotan and Willer\n\n1986).\n SISES is an expert system used for selecting an appropriate site for\n\na specific use ( Findikaki 1986).\n DMWW is an expert system for designing a municipal water well ( K.\n\nStrzepek, University of Colorado, personal communication, 1988).\n The design process can be very complex and require much information\n\non procedures and related knowledge ( Russell 1989).\n The design is created in the first phase, and then modified in the\n\nsecond phase until the user feels comfortable.\n Experience and judgement play important roles in both phases, and\n\nthis is why expert systems by exploiting experience may help, thereby,\n\nenhancing the design process. \n\n  a water resources system is another field of\n\nexpert systems application.\n RAISON is a system developed for the analysis of acid rain data.\n It is designed to examine the relationship between the terrain\n\nsensitivity index, which assesses susceptibility to acid rain deposition and\n\npossible deposition levels ( Swayne and Fraser 1986).\n WATQUAS is an expert system for extracting knowledge from a large\n\nquantity of available historical water quality data and interpreting it in a\n\nuseful form ( Allen 1986).\n ARIANE is an intelligent decision-support tool for guiding the user\n\nthrough the multi-annual operation planning process in Hydro-Quebec ( M.\n\nHanscom, Hydro-Quebec, personal communication, 1988).\n RRA is an expert system for the administration of the\n\nacreage-limitation provision of the US Reclamation Reform Act of 1982.\n It provides a means for determining the status of the landholder, as\n\nwell as the number of acres on which subsidized reclamation water can be\n\nreceived ( K. Strzepek, University of Colorado, personal communication,\n\n1988).\n SID, Seattle Water Department\'s integrated drought management expert\n\nsystem, is an expert system designed to evaluate and display information for\n\ndrought-management planning.\n A linear programming model is used to generate optimal operating\n\npolicies as a function of numerous past drought experiences.\n These policies are incorporated into an expert system and the user is\n\nrequired to identify the degree to which the current drought situation is\n\nsimilar to past events ( Palmer and Tull 1987; Palmer and Holmes 1988). \n\n  of water resources systems, expert\n\nsystems are slowly taking their place in practice.\n SID, an expert system already mentioned, is used for planning and\n\noperation of Seattle water distribution system during the drought.\n JOE is an expert system designed to aid in operations of the Jenpeg\n\ngenerating station in Manitoba.\n Manitoba Hydro\'s Jenpeg generating station is located near the outlet\n\nof Lake Winnipeg into the Nelson River system.\n The operation of Jenpeg during the freeze-up period is very complex,\n\ninvolving many judgemental calls, and has a major impact on the hydro\n\npower generation downstream ( Raban 1989).\n EMMAES is an expert system built around the EMMA model used within\n\nManitoba Hydro to plan the integrated operation of hydro and thermal power\n\ngeneration and tielines, as well as with maintenance considerations.\n )\n\npreparation of an annual budget; (  ii  ) preparation of weekly\n\nschedules for releases, thermal and hydro power generation, and imports and\n\nexports of energy; and (  iii  ) long-term planning that includes\n\nsuch tasks as evaluation of benefits from installing additional capacity and\n\nexamining particular operational conditions that may occur in the system\n\n( Nagy  et al.  1989; Grahovac and Simonovic 1990). \n\n  The relative importance of expert systems to improvements in\n\nwater resources projects has not yet been established, but some practical\n\nexperience has already been documented ( Nagy  et al.  1989; Raban\n\n1989; Palmer and Holmes 1988). \n\n  The following sections present definitions and approaches\n\nappropriate for the application of expert systems in the field of hydrology.\n These are followed by an review of present research.\n To illustrate their development, a case study of the use of an expert\n\nsystem for the selection of a suitable method for flow measurement in open\n\nchannels is presented. \n\n\n\n\n\n  Expert systems have been identified, by a number of authors, as a\n\nway to successfully apply AI techniques\n Through the application of AI techniques, expert systems capture the\n\nbasic knowledge required to assist an individual dealing with problems of\n\nvarying complexity ( Rolston 1988).\n Expert systems function as an assistant to an expert; a partner\n\nto an expert, or a replacement for part of an expert\'s knowledge.\n The following definition, derived by the author, seems appropriate\n\nfor the field of water resources.\n A water resources expert system is a computer application that\n\nassists in solving complicated water resources problems by incorporating engi\n\n<l> neering knowledge, principles of systems analysis, and experience,\n\nto provide aid in making engineering judgements and including intuition in\n\nthe solution procedure  ( Simonovic 1990; Simonovic and Savic 1989).\n\n\n\n \n\nlowing components: user interface; explanation subsystem; knowledge\n\nacquisition subsystem; knowledge base; and inference engine.\n Figure 1 illustrates the basic structure of an expert system.\n is responsible for requesting and\n\ntranslating user input, and presenting generated results to the user.\n is a very important part of an\n\nexpert system, as it is responsible for explaining the reasoning behind any\n\nconclusion the system reaches.\n is used to perform\n\nmodifications to the knowledge base.\n contains the facts and rules associated\n\nwith the application field.\n These rules can vary from being strictly procedural ( well-defined\n\nand invariant) to heuristic ( practices and procedures that are valuable\n\nbut are incapable of proof and are gathered through experience).\n controls the execution of the system\n\nand determines how to solve a particular problem.\n It uses the knowledge base to modify and expand the contents of\n\nworking memory.\n In simple words, the inference engine is a search mechanism.\n Most expert systems are based on backward or forward search\n\ntechniques.\n In backward chaining, the system begins with the desired goal and\n\nworks towards the requisite conditions to satisfy this goal; whereas forward\n\nchaining uses the known conditions and works towards the desired goal of the\n\nconsultation. \n\n \n\nform.\n Therefore, expert systems use a collection of the rules and facts to\n\nmimic expert behaviour related to problem solving.\n In an expert system, knowledge can be represented in the form of the\n\nrules, semantic nets, or frames.\n are the simplest and most popular knowledge\n\nrepresentation scheme.\n They are most appropriate when the domain knowledge results from\n\nassociations between facts that have evolved through years of problem\n\nsolving.\n Another approach is to represent domain knowledge through a network\n\nof nodes and arcs, known as a  semantic net  .\n The nodes represent the objects, concepts, or events; and the\n\narcs represent the relationships between the nodes.\n refers to a special way of\n\nrepresenting concepts and situations\n Essentially, it is the same as a semantic net, in that it consists\n\nof a system of nodes and arcs.\n However, in the case of a frame representation all the properties of\n\nan object or concept are collected together at a node in a package.\n Frames and semantic nets are most helpful in grouping and\n\nstructuring a large number of rules. \n\n  The tools for developing an expert system can be divided into\n\nthree main classes; (  i  ) general purpose languages; (  ii\n\n ) representational languages; and (  iii  ) expert system\n\nbuilding shells and environments.\n\n\nprogram language  , such as FORTRAN, C, or PASCAL  \n Using these languages, the developer has complete flexibility, but\n\nthe entire expert system structure must be developed and this is very costly\n\nin time and required resources.\n , such as\n\nPROLOG, SRL, or OPS5, require only organization and expression of the domain\n\nknowledge.\n As with the programming languages, a significant portion of\n\nthe code necessary to produce an expert system must be written by the\n\ndeveloper.\n are\n\npackages that aid in the rapid prototyping of application expert systems.\n They usually provide one or more knowledge representations and\n\nreference mechanisms.\n Using these tools, the level of effort that must be applied to\n\ndeveloping expert systems is greatly reduced, allowing the developer to focus\n\non acquiring knowledge and refining the system behaviour.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '942295aa-50b6-4695-977d-1d88214b4edd', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.791027+00:00', 'english_score': 0.906733512878418, 'non_english_score': 0.09326648712158203}

however, CSA ( 1989) permits lower loads\n\nin some cases.\n These are intended to deal with overstrength members, selected to\n\nsatisfy stiffness requirements, for example.\n Thus, for a ductile braced frame, when twice the seismic load, plus\n\nthe specified gravity load, is less than the brace yield load, the lower load\n\nmay be used for design.\n This load is approximately equal to the load that the brace would\n\ncarry if the frame was being designed as the third category of structure,\n\nthat is, without special provisions for ductility.\n For the braced frame with nominal ductility, the load is 1.33 times\n\nthe seismic load, plus the gravity load, which also brings the load to\n\napproximately the same level as for the third category of structure. \n\n \n\nture to perform as assumed, there may be some reluctance to design the\n\nconnections for less than the brace yield load.\n\n\nFigure   2  a  were assumed to resist the full brace yield\n\nload.\n The effect of using loads less than the tensile yield load will be\n\nexamined in the light of the analytical results for another braced frame in\n\nwhich connection resistance less than the full yield load was assumed.\n\n\n\n  ( b) Axial loads induced in the columns by the yielding of\n\noverloaded braces must be added to the specified gravity loads to obtain the\n\ndesign loads for columns under the severe seismic load condition.\n Because of the low probability of all braces being overloaded\n\nsimultaneously, a column in a lower floor need not be designed to carry the\n\nsum of the maximum brace loads induced at each higher floor.\n For the subject designs, the loads in any column due to braces were\n\ntaken as the maximum loads induced at any level above the column considered,\n\nplus the square root of the sum of the squares of all other brace-induced\n\nloads above that level.\n The validity of this combination rule will be examined herein.\n\n\n\n  ( c) Yielding of braces leads to redistribution of the horizon\n\n<l> tal shear carried by the braces, which then leads to a change in load\n\ncarried by beams forming part of the lateral load resisting system.\n Depending on the bracing configuration, some beams have no axial\n\nforces induced under lateral load until brace yielding occurs.\n The assumptions used to estimate these loads for the beam design will\n\nalso be examined.\n These assumptions significantly influence the design of the short\n\nbeams, i.e., those supported at their centre by the intersecting braces, and\n\nare described in detail by Redwood and Channagiri ( 1991).   \n\n  For comparative purposes, in addition to the DBF design shown in\n\n   Figure   2  a  , other designs were\n\nproduced for the same structural configuration and also for the Victoria,\n\nB.C., location ( Channagiri 1990).\n A braced frame with nominal ductility, NDBF, corresponding to\n\ncategory (  ii  ) and designed according to Clause 27.5 of CSA (\n\n1989) is shown in    Figure   2  b  .\n Again, it is assumed that brace yield loads are transmitted to the\n\nother members. \n\n  iii\n\n ) , that is, one for which no consideration of ductility has been\n\ngiven.\n It should be recognized that, by virtue of Sentence 4.1.9.3(1) of NRC\n\n( 1990), the latter design would not in fact be permitted in Victoria, B.C.;\n\nnevertheless, it provides a useful comparison, since it should\n\ncorrespond to very limited ductile behaviour. \n\n  Parallel to these designs, three braced frame designs were also\n\ngenerated for the location of Montreal, thus incorporating the effects of a\n\nsignificantly lower seismic-to-gravity load ratio.\n 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n  The dynamic analysis was performed using the program DRAIN-2D (\n\nKannan and Powell 1973), modified to include bracing elements ( Jain and Goel\n\n1978).\n Assumptions made for the analysis corresponded to those on which the\n\ndesign was based, and may be summarized as follows: \x97 columns and braces are\n\npin-ended, and are without lateral support between floors; \x97 effective length\n\nfactors of 1.0 are used for all columns and braces; \x97 beams are simply\n\nconnected to the columns, and in those floors where they intersect the\n\nbraces, the beam is continuous through the intersection point; beams are\n\nlaterally supported.       \n\n  Gravity loading equal to the specified dead and live loads was\n\napplied to the structures throughout the imposed earthquake excitation\n\nhistories.\n These loads impose initial compressions in columns and braces\n\nand tensions in some beams.\n\n\nnagiri ( 1991). \n\n  The DRAIN-2D program carries out nonlinear time-history analysis\n\nof two-dimensional frame structures.\n Mass is lumped at nodes; viscous damping with both mass and stiffness\n\ndependence was incorporated, and was assumed to be 5% of critical for\n\nthe highest and lowest modes.\n Constant acceleration is assumed in each time-step, and equilibrium\n\ncorrections are made by applying corrective loads in the succeeding\n\ntime-step.\n Fundamental periods of the structures analyzed lie in the range 1\x971.7\n\ns ( the structure of    Figure   2  a \n\nhad periods of 1.47, 0.51 0.37, 0.28, and 0.22 s for the first five modes),\n\nand an integration time-step of 0.02 s was therefore assumed.\n The total integration time used in the analysis was 30 s for each\n\nearthquake record.\n P-&DELTA; effects were approximated by including a geometric\n\nstiffness based on the element axial force under static load ( Kannan and\n\nPowell 1973). \n\n  A primary purpose of the analysis was to determine if the\n\nstructures could be expected to perform as assumed in their design.\n For the DBF, the primary interest was to determine if the beams and\n\ncolumns would indeed remain elastic if the braces yielded.\n Thus for this structure, beams and columns were modelled as elastic\n\nelements, and only braces were modelled as yielding elements.\n If beams or columns then proved to be overloaded, the extent of\n\noverload would provide a guide to selection of a section with the necessary\n\nincreased capacity.\n The same modelling is appropriate for the NDBF, whereas for the SBF,\n\na fully elastic model would be adequate if the basic design assumptions were\n\nvalid.\n However, the braces were modelled to exhibit nonlinear hysteretic\n\nbehaviour for this structure also. \n\n  The resistance of yielding elements used in the analysis and the\n\nresistances of members used to compare with the analytical results were based\n\non their most probable values, i.e., the nominal values with the resistance\n\nfactor  = 1.0. \n\n  The brace members were modelled as " buckling elements," denoted\n\nEL9 by Jain and Goel ( 1978).\n This is a multi-linear hysteretic model which may yield in tension or\n\nbuckle in compression.\n An example of the hysteretic behaviour modelled by this element is\n\nillustrated in    Figure   4.\n , is\n\nequal to the unfactored axial compressive resistance of CSA ( 1989).\n |\n\n   u  , applies, the amount of reduction being based on\n\nempirical data ( Jain 1978).\n The load versus deflection path followed as the brace compression is\n\nreduced and loading becomes tensile is a function of loading history, and is\n\nbased on empirical results.\n\n\n u  and the compressive displacement occurring since the last load\n\nreversal.\n Point B indicates the degree of pinching and is related to the\n\nslenderness ratio, and point C is a function of residual displacements.\n The element does not model local buckling, and thus the deformations\n\npredicted by the analysis must be critically examined in relation to the sec\n\n<l> tion width-to-thickness ratios provided. \n\n  Columns were modelled as elastic truss elements, and beams as\n\nelastic beam \x97 column elements, in view of the large axial forces expected\n\nwhen braces yield\n Because beams were considered to be laterally supported by floor\n\nslabs, only their yield behaviour, and not buckling, is modelled.    \n Contribution of the slab in resisting axial or bending loads was\n\nignored. \n\n\n  For the structure located in Victoria, earthquake records from\n\nthe western U.S.A. were used as input to the analysis   Ten components\n\nof six recorded earthquakes were considered, as listed in Table 1.\n Some of these same records were used for the Montreal structures,\n\nin view of the lack of strong motion records for eastern Canada, and, in\n\naddition, the Saguenay earthquake of 1988 was also considered.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'e45a9880-f5cd-45b7-869d-f950857f1fe9', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.792426+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9243478775024414, 'non_english_score': 0.0756521224975586}
{'text': "CHANGE DETECTION USING PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS\n\nAND FUZZY SET THEORY   \n\n\n\n\n\n  Cet article présente deux nouvelles\n\nméthodes permettant de faire un meilleur usage de l'information\n\nmultibande obtenue &agrave; partir de données de\n\ntélédétection pour la détection des changements\n Au lieu d'effectuer une analyse des composantes principales sur une\n\ncombinaison d'images multibandes initiales, celle-ci a été\n\neffectuée sur des données résultant de\n\ndifférences d'images\n Ainsi, la plupart des informations relatives aux changements ont\n\nété conservées sur les premi&egrave;res composantes\n\nprincipales\n Des opérations fondées sur la théorie des\n\nensembles flous ont été proposées en vue de combiner les\n\ninformations sur les changements provenant des différents canaux en\n\nune seule image\n Les zones ayant subi des changements peuvent alors &ecircumflex;tre\n\nextraites de cette derni&egrave;re image\n Des images de Kitchener-Waterloo, en Ontario, acquises par le capteur\n\nthématique de Landsat pendant deux années successives sont\n\nutilisées pour illustrer ces méthodes\n Un certain nombre de stratégies sur l'utilisation des\n\nopérations fondées sur la théorie des ensembles flous\n\nsont également presentées.    \n\n\n  In this paper two procedures that were developed to make\n\nbetter use of multispectral information from remotely sensed data for change\n\ndetection are discussed.\n Instead of applying principal component analysis ( PCA) to a combined\n\ndata set of original multispectral images, PCA was applied to difference\n\nimages.\n Thus, most change information was preserved in the first few\n\nprincipal component images.\n Operations based on fuzzy set theory were proposed to combine change\n\ninformation from different image channels into a single-image channel.\n Changed areas could then be extracted from this single image.\n Landsat Thematic Mapper ( TM) images acquired in two successive year\n\nover Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, are used to illustrate these methods.\n Some strategies on the use of fuzzy set operations are discussed.\n\n \n\n\n  In remote sensing, changes can be determined by comparing\n\nthe spectral response differences at the same spatial location among a set of\n\ntwo or more multispectral images acquired at different times.\n These images are first spatially registered.\n A commonly used change detection procedure then follows in which\n\nchanges are identified via thresholding a difference image that has been\n\nobtained by subtracting one band of image on one date from the same band of\n\nimage on another date.\n However, it is usually not possible to detect changes occurring in a\n\nregion using only one spectral band because different types of changes may be\n\ncaptured in different bands.\n Therefore, changes have to be enhanced and extracted from\n\nmultispectral imagery. \n\n  Two types of procedures for using multispectral data in\n\nchange component enhancement are commonly used.\n The first type involves simple image arithmetic between images of the\n\nsame spectral band for two dates.\n For convenience, we define the two images obtained for two different\n\ndates of the same spectral band as band-pair images.\n Image arithmetic includes rationing and differencing band-pair\n\nimages.\n Images so generated are referred to as change component images.\n To locate and identify change automatically, change component images\n\nare thesholded or classified ( Jensen, 1986; Fung and LeDrew, 1988; Pilon\n\n et al.  , 1988; Singh, 1989).\n To detect changes visually, rationed or differenced band-pair images\n\ncan be analyzed based on their colour displays on a video monitor or\n\nphotographic products ( Howarth and Wickware, 1981; Howarth and Boassan,\n\n1983).\n Although logically straightforward due to increased data\n\nredundancy and display difficulties, this type of procedure becomes\n\ninefficient to use when the image dimension ( that is, the number of spectral\n\nbands) exceeds three. \n\n  To overcome these difficulties, a second type of change component\n\nenhancement procedure employs image transformation methods.\n Transformation methods include vegetation indexing ( VI) ( Tucker,\n\n1979), tasseled cap analysis ( KT-Transform) ( Kauth and Thomas, 1976),\n\nchange vector analysis ( CVA) ( Malila, 1980), and principal component\n\nanalysis ( PCA) ( Lodwick, 1979; Byrne  et al.  , 1980; Ingebristen\n\n et al.  , 1985; Fung and LeDrew, 1987).\n\n\nnal multispectral data can be preserved in a relatively small number of\n\ncomponents.\n Rather than serving as general enhancement tools, the VI and\n\nKT-Transform methods were developed specifically for such purposes as\n\nenhancing the vegetation or the soil component.\n While CVA has the potential of summarizing various types of change\n\ncomponents and their magnitudes into separate image channels, it has rarely\n\nbeen applied since its introduction.\n Among these transformation techniques, the PCA method has been most\n\ncommonly used.\n Researchers using PCA for change detection have reported that the\n\nminor component images are likely to contain most of the change information\n\nwhen multispectral images that have been obtained on two dates are applied as\n\nan integrated data set.\n The amount of change information contained in each principal\n\ncomponent image, however, may vary from image to image.\n It may not be an easy task to determine which principal component\n\nimage to work with.\n In addition, the use of PCA in such a manner is subject to the\n\ncondition that the areas of changes have to be a small proportion of the\n\nentire study area ( Richards, 1984; Fung and LeDrew, 1987). \n\n  It would be desirable to deal with only one image channel and to\n\nextract most, if not all, change information from this channel of image.\n In this paper, a method is presented for transforming change\n\ninformation into one image channel from images of different spectral bands.\n The main objectives are: &bullet; to introduce an alternative method\n\non the use of PCA for change component enhancement with which change infor\n\n<l> mation is guaranteed to be preserved in the major component images\n\nregardless the proportion of changed area in a study area; and &bullet; to\n\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of fuzzy set theory in combining change\n\ninformation from different image channels into a single-image channel. \n\n\n  The change detection procedure proposed in this study can be\n\ndivided into six steps: &bullet; spatially register images from two different\n\ndates; &bullet; undertake a band-pair image differencing for each spectral\n\nband and reduce registration noise; &bullet; apply PCA transformation to the\n\nmultispectral difference image; &bullet; determine change membership\n\nfunctions for a number of selected change component images; &bullet; apply\n\nfuzzy operations to combine change information in different change component\n\nimages into a single image; &bullet; determine changed areas based on the\n\nimage generated at step five. \n\n  At step one, two images from different dates can be registered\n\nusing a geometric correction program.\n After the image-to-image registration, two images with the same\n\ncoordinate system are obtained: X = { x  i  | i = 1, 2,\n\n&dotted-line;, n} of date one and Y = { y  i  | i = 1, 2,\n\n&dotted-line;, n} of date two, where x  i  ' = [ x  i1  , x\n\n i2  , &dotted-line;, x  ip  ] and y  i  ' = [ y\n\n i1  , y  i2  , &dotted-line;, y  ip  ] .\n The parameter n denotes the number of pixels in an image and p the\n\nnumber of spectral bands. \n\n  , for\n\neach spectral band j, can be created, where DIF  j  = { &delta; \n\n ij   =(x  ij  - y  ij  ) | i = 1, 2,\n\n&dotted-line;, n} and j = 1, 2, &dotted-line; p.\n A grey-scale mapping can then be applied to every difference image,\n\nDIF  j  , j = 1, 2, &dotted-line; p.\n This further reduces registration noise in each difference image (\n\nGong  et al.  , 1992). \n\n  In traditional change detection, one difference image of a\n\nspecific spectral band is selected among these difference images.\n This difference image should contain more change information than the\n\nother difference images for a particular application.\n An image thresholding technique is then applied to detect changes\n\nusing the selected difference image ( Jensen, 1986; Fung and LeDrew, 1988).\n , the red spectral band difference\n\nimage of Landsat multispectral scanner ( MSS) data is usually considered to\n\ncontain more information on rural to urban land-cover changes than the other\n\nthree MSS bands.\n can be determined on the\n\nhistogram of DIF  2  using the mean ( ave) and standard deviation (\n\nstd) (  Figure 1  ) .\n Deciding whether a pixel has changed is simply a matter of testing\n\nwhether &delta;   ij   falls outside of range [ T  1\n\n , T  2  ] .   \n\n  Two problems are associated with the above-mentioned traditional\n\nmethod, and they will be overcome by subsequent steps three to five.\n As mentioned in the introduction, the first problem is that different\n\ntypes of change information are contained in different spectral bands;\n\nthus, the use of one spectral band usually does not allow every type of\n\nchanges to be detected.\n The second problem is that once thresholding is applied to a\n\ndifference image, change information occurring at smaller magnitudes (\n\nthat is, within range [ T  1  , T  2  ] ) will be lost.\n Also, noise could be included as change if its magnitude falls\n\noutside range [ T  1  , T  2  ] . \n\n  At step three, the difference images are used to generate a\n\nvariance-covariance matrix.\n This is used to find a new set of axes according to the eigen\n\nstructure of the feature space.\n With the variance-covariance matrix, PCA can be applied to the\n\ndifference images.\n The resultant principal component images are called principal\n\ncomponent difference images, denoted by PCD  j  = { &delta;  eij\n\n | i = 1, 2, &dotted-line;, n} where j = 1, 2, &dotted-line;, p ;\n\n&delta;  eij  is a pixel value for pixel i in the jth principal\n\ncomponent which results from a linear transformation of the difference\n\nimages with the transformation coefficients determined with PCA.\n i\n\n - y  i  | i = 1, 2, &dotted-line;, n} instead of the\n\ntraditional application of PCA in change detection where a combined\n\ntwo-date data set,{(x  i  ' y  i'  ' ) ' | i = 1, 2,\n\n&dotted-line;, n} of two p dimensions, is used.\n Because the variance in a difference image represents primarily\n\nchange information and the purpose of PCA is to preserve most variances into\n\nthe first few principal components, the application of PCA to difference\n\nimages will result in most change information preserved in the first few PCD\n\nimages. \n\n  At step four, the first two or three PCD images containing change\n\ninformation are selected.\n The exact number of PCDs is determined according to the eigenvalues\n\nand the correlation matrix of difference images.\n Each selected PCD image and its histogram are analyzed, and a fuzzy\n\nmembership function of change is empirically defined based on the analysis\n\nresults.\n , it is reasonable to assume that the\n\nmore distant a pixel value &delta; is from the average, ave, the more likely\n\nis that pixel to fall into the change class.\n Based on the shape of the histogram of a PCD image, parameters of a\n\nfuzzy membership function of change can be determined.\n While a fuzzy membership function may take a variety of forms (\n\nZadeh, 1978), in the case of  Figure 1  an inverse\n\ntriangular-shaped function may be suitable.\n A more sophisticated change membership function may be determined\n\nbased on the knowledge of the various types of change in the study area.\n For example, statistics on various change types can be estimated from\n\nselected training samples. \n\n  e\n\n ) , can be defined as:  where &mu; \n\ncj  ( &delta;  e  ) represents the degree of pixel value\n\n&delta;  e  in image PCD  j  belonging to a fuzzy set of\n\nchange, C.\n L&delta; , ave, and H&delta; are the three parameters defining the\n\ninverse triangular-shaped function.\n L&delta; and H&delta; can be determined empirically by examining the\n\nhistogram distribution of image PCD  j  , and ave is the average\n\npixel value in image PCD  j  .\n ) is\n\nshown in  Figure 2  .\n (\n\n&delta;  e  ) , to an image, PCD  j  a change membership (\n\nCM) image, CM  j  = { &mu;  cj  ( &delta;  ei  ) |\n\ni = 1, 2, &dotted-line;, n}, is obtained. \n\n  At the fifth step, various change information from different CM\n\nimages can be combined into one image, CCM, by applying the fuzzy set theory\n\n( Zadeh, 1965).\n Most operations based on the fuzzy set theory can be realized by\n\nusing three basic types of fuzzy set operator: fuzzy union ( &square-root;),\n\nfuzzy intersection (  ) , and fuzzy complement (\n\n ) .\n While there are a number of definitions for fuzzy union and fuzzy\n\nintersection, the maximum and minimum rule are used in this study.\n is\n\nequivalent to max ( &mu;  1  , &mu;  2  ) , and their fuzzy\n\nintersection is min( &mu;  1  , &mu;  2  ) .\n .\n For example, if one wishes to combine change information in three CM\n\nimages in such a manner that both the subtle changes in CM  3  and\n\nchanges in either CM  1  or CM  2  are included in the\n\nfinal resultant image, CCM = { &mu;(&delta;

{'text': 'WIND TUNNEL INVESTIGATION OF A WING-PROPELLER MODEL\n\nPERFORMANCE DEGRADATION DUE TO DISTRIBUTED UPPER-SURFACE ROUGHNESS AND\n\nLEADING EDGE SHAPE MODIFICATION  \n **\n\n   *Guest Worker, Applied Aerodynamics Laboratory\n\n  **Research Officer, High Speed Aerodynamics Laboratory\n\n\n\n\n  A wind tunnel investigation has assessed the effects of\n\ndistributed upper-surface roughness, and leading-edge ice formation on a\n\npowered wing propeller model.  \n\n  In the unpowered state, it was found that roughness reduces\n\nthe lift slope, and maximum lift by 30 to 50 percent, depending upon particle\n\nsize and Reynolds number.\n The leading edge region is especially sensitive to these disturbances;\n\nhowever, removal of the roughness over a small portion of the nose restored\n\nthe wing to close to its original performance.  \n\n  The application of power to the wing, with an increase of\n\nslipstream dynamic pressure, increases the lift slope and maximum lift;\n\nhowever, this benefit is lost if the wing is roughened.\n Subtraction of the propeller reactions indicated that the slipstream\n\ninteraction accounted for half the lift increase and also resulted in reduced\n\ndrag for the clean surface.\n This drag reduction was removed when the wing was roughened,\n\nindicating that the degradation of wing performance due to roughening is\n\nrelatively greater when a slipstream is present, compared with the unpowered\n\nwing.  \n\n  Leading-edge ice accretion causes similar large losses in\n\nlift and increases of form drag although a comparison of the two types of\n\ncontamination showed that leading-edge ice produces a smaller reduction of\n\nlift slope prior to flow separation.\n In both types of contamination, Reynolds number is important, and\n\nemphasizes the necessity of testing under near full-scale conditions. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\ntions in the form of freezing rain or snow, have focused attention, on the\n\ndegradation of aerodynamic surfaces.\n One of the most recent accidents, involving a Fokker F-28, mk 1000\n\njet aircraft, and the subject of a Commission of Inquiry in Canada, dealt\n\nspecifically with the degradation of such surfaces due to ice and snow\n\ncontaminants on the wings.\n The information contained in this paper stems in part from the\n\ninvestigation conducted for the Commission of Inquiry into the Air Ontario\n\nCrash at Dryden, Ontario, March 10, 1989.\n 10 Morgan, J.M.,\n\nWagner, G.A. and Wickens, R.H.  -  A Report of the Flight Dynamics\n\nof the Fokker F-28 mk 1000 as they pertain to the accident at Dryden,\n\nOntario, March 1989.   NRC/NAE misc. 64.  \n Investigations of the effects of uniform roughness on airfoils shows\n\nclearly that stalling is premature, loss of maximum lift can range from 30 to\n\n50%, ( depending on Reynolds number) and form drag reaches very high levels\n\nat angles of attack below normal clean wing stall. \n\n  The effect of upper surface roughness on complete aircraft\n\nconfigurations is less well known; however, there is a long history of\n\naircraft accidents related to flight in icing conditions and several recent\n\naccidents, including the Air Ontario F-28 accident, involving swept-wing jet\n\naircraft have highlighted the problem.\n\n\n that early flow separation and stalling was a characteristic\n\nresult of ice and snow contaminants on the wing   11\n\nCommission of Enquiry into the Air Ontario crash at Dryden, Ontario.

May 1966.  \n Thrust coefficient was estimated from the isolated propeller data of\n\nReference 5.   \n\n\n \n\ndum grit was applied over various portions of the chord.\n Three grades of standard grit were used: 150 ( .0041", 80 ( .0083"),\n\n46 ( .0165").\n These correspond approximately to average roughness heights of .03", .06",\n\nand .11" respectively on a full-scale wing of 10    feet\n\n  chord giving roughness height/chord ratios of 0.000227, .000461 and .000916\n\nrespectively.\n In addition, a heavy grade ( 50 grit) of commercial sandpaper was\n\napplied to the wing surface.\n The roughness height and concentration of this application was\n\nconsidered to be significantly greater than the standard grit particles\n\napplied manually to the wing surface. \n\n \n\nface from the lower leading edge stagnation region to the flap hinge line.\n Since only the forward portion of the chord was found to be sensitive\n\nhowever, most of the investigation was performed with only the first 25-30%\n\nof the chord roughened and the results presented in this report are for\n\n30% coverage.       \n The density of application was not varied or determined\n\nprecisely, and in the case of sandpaper application, the transition was\n\nabrupt. \n\n \n\nresenting rime and glaze ice accretions were applied to the wing leading\n\nedge.\n The shapes were similar to those of Reference 6 and are shown in\n\nFigure 2c. \n\n\n\n  With the application of power on the clean wing, the resulting\n\nslipstream interaction produces an increase in both lift slope and maximum\n\nlift by about 25%, and an increase of stalling angle of about 4 degrees.\n Roughly half of this lift increment comes from the propeller thrust\n\nand normal force reactions; the other half is attributed to the interaction\n\nof the slipstream with the wing ( Figure 3a). \n\n  The wing drag polar, as seen in Figure 3b, is shifted by an\n\namount that corresponds to the thrust force plus a leading edge thrust on the\n\nwing due to increased leading edge suction.\n The drag equivalent of the estimated propeller thrust has a value of\n\nabout 0.085, which, when subtracted from the total wing force at zero lift\n\napparently produces a negative drag or thrust on the wing.\n This effect, known as the ` Squire Effect\', has been alluded to\n\nbefore  and is attributed the effects of increased\n\npressure and flow rotation in the slipstream.  7 Squire, H.B. and\n\nChester, W. - Calculation of the Effect of Slipstream on Lift and Drag. ARC\n\nR&M 2368, 1950.  \n\n  With roughness applied to the wing upper surface there appears to\n\nbe a loss of lift slope and maximum lift of about 25 to 35% depending upon\n\nroughness element size ( Figure 4a).\n In effect, the benefits of powered lift, resulting from slipstream\n\ninteraction, is significantly reduced.\n Drag also increases as the flow separates prematurely, and there\n\nalso is an increase in the parasite drag at zero lift due to roughness, and\n\nincreased dynamic pressure in the slipstream.\n The effect of roughness on wing pitching moment is small at angles of\n\nattack below stall, ( &alpha; &lt; 10&degree;) but the moment becomes more\n\nnose down as roughness size increases ( Figure 3c). \n\n  The application of the heavy sandpaper roughness further\n\ndeteriorated the wing performance under power at the Reynolds number of 1.3\n\nmillion.\n Maximum lift decreased slightly, as did the lift slope; although the\n\nstall was not sharply defined.\n Drag also increased near zero lift but the pitching moment did not\n\nchange significantly, although the tendency continued to be nose-down. \n\n  A comparison between the powered and unpowered wing drag polars\n\nshows the relative effects of roughness with and without power ( Figure 6).\n It is clear from these graphs that roughness, especially when it\n\nreaches the heavy proportions of sandpaper coverage, has a much more adverse\n\neffect on drag of the powered wing near maximum lift than for the unpowered\n\nwing in uniform flow.\n At lift coefficients below stall however, drag increases between\n\npowered and unpowered wings are similar.\n The lift curves exhibit about the same degree of degradation of\n\nperformance between powered and unpowered configurations . The pitching\n\nmoment change appears to be smaller when the wing is powered and is\n\naccompanied by an increase in slope ( C  m    \n\nversus to   alpha) and a small change in the nose-up direction (\n\nFigure 5c).                 \n\n   \n\n  In order to simulate the scrubbing action of the slipstream, a\n\nportion of the roughness was removed at the propeller location.\n This resulted in a modest improvement of performance ( Figure 5a).\n\n\n\n\n  In order to separate the propeller reactions from the total wing\n\nforces, and to compare unpowered wing characteristics with those with the\n\nwing immersed in the slipstream, the isolated propeller thrust, normal force\n\nand pitching moment were estimated from Reference 5 and were removed from the\n\nmeasured wing force and moment data.\n No attempt was made to correct the propeller data for the blockage\n\nand upwash events of the wing; however the comments of Reference 8 and\n\nthe experimental data of Reference 4 suggest that these interactions may be\n\nsmall.\n\n\n  Typical wing characteristics with the propeller reactions removed\n\nare shown in Figure 6.\n for the clean wing ( Figure 6a) is\n\nroughly half the total powered lift increments.\n The loss of lift due to roughness increases with roughness scale and\n\nis apparently greater for the unpowered wing than for the powered wing.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '7743b871-223f-45d1-85f9-3d7ad49f3b63', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.795204+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9564939141273499, 'non_english_score': 0.043506085872650146}

  r   , where  r    n  , is not new; it is called the  node placement\n\nproblem    \n\n .\n The node placement problem is a well-established problem in other\n\nfields of research; for instance, in the design of circuit board layouts in\n\nwhich a node has to be placed on a two-dimensional board \n\n   .\n In such problems there are two basic objectives: 1) the minimization\n\nof total wire length connecting the nodes; and, 2) the minimization of the\n\ncircuit board area. \n\n  In power systems, however, the geographical placement of a bus\n\ncannot be changed by an electric utility company, since this is defined by\n\nthe distribution of population and placement of energy sources.\n Moreover, the wire length cannot be modified since the transmission\n\nlines only connect the various energy sources to the loads.\n Nevertheless, it is extremely important to mathematically define a\n\nposition on &beta;   r   for each bus of the system.\n By doing so, according to an electrical criterion, we make the bus\n\nposition a part of the data required by this approach to partitioning of the\n\npower network. \n\n  buses\n\nand an  n    n  symmetric\n\nconnection matrix  C  =  C  ij   , where \n\nC  ij   is the connectivity weight between buses  i\n\n and  j  (  C  ii   = 0 and  C  ij\n\n   for  i    j  ,  i  = [ 1, &dotted-line;,  n  ] ) .\n buses that minimizes\n\nthe weighted sum of the squared distances between the buses.\n coordinates of\n\nbus  i  , and  S  denotes the weighted sum of squared\n\ndistances between the buses, then the one-dimensional problem is to find the\n\nrow vector  x  T   = (  x   1  ,\n\n&dotted-line;,  x   n  ) which minimizes  ,  where  T  denotes\n\nvector transposition\n = 0, for\n\nall  i  , the following quadratic constraint is imposed:  .  \n\n  mathematical\n\nequation  \n =\n\n C  j   ) ,   .\n\n\n ) such that   .\n\n\n\n b\n\n ii   , of  B  is the  i  th   row (\n\nor column) of the connection matrix  C  , and the off-diagonal\n\nelement of  b  ij   is the negative of the corresponding\n\nentry in  C  .\n .\n\n \n\n  The Lagrangian of the nonlinear optimization problem described by\n\n( 2.7) and ( 2.2) is defined as  \n\n , from which the necessary condition is given\n\nby  .  \n\n  x\n\n if and only if  is an eigenvalue of\n\n B  , and  x  is the corresponding eigenvector.\n and imposing (\n\n2.2), we obtain \n Consequently, the value of the objective function described by ( 2.7)\n\nis the value of the eigenvalue of  B  .\n B\n\n , and the solution,  x  , is the eigenvector\n\nassociated with the smallest eigenvalue of  B  . \n\n  is\n\nsimply the sum of  r  quadratic terms, one for each dimension, and\n\nthe minimum of  S  is given by the sum of the  r  smallest\n\neigenvalues of  B  .\n To illustrate the application of the node placement algorithm [ 9],\n\nconsider a four-node graph; its connection matrix,  C  , and the\n\nweighted connectivity matrix,  B  , are described in    Figure   1.\n It is required that all four nodes be placed in one dimension in a\n\ncertain order, such that the total wire length connecting the four nodes\n\nis a minimum.\n are\n\nformulated as follows:   if nodes  i\n\n and  j  are directly connected otherwise  \n and their associated\n\neigenvectors  E   l  ,  E   2  ,  E\n\n  3  and  E   4  are given in    Figure   2.\n\n\nFigure   2, where  E   2  has been used as the \n\ny  coordinate.\n Any other combination of node placement ordering gives a larger total\n\nwire length. \n\n  If the same placement procedures are used in power-network\n\npartitioning, only the physical connections of the network will be considered\n\nin a resulting partition; therefore, strongly connected buses may be assigned\n\nto different clusters.\n A modification in the placement algorithm is required so that the\n\ntechnique can be sufficiently utilized in power-network partitioning;\n\ni.e., so that buses belonging to the same cluster are strongly connected\n\nelectrically. \n\n  , as described above, is a weighted\n\nconnectivity matrix that measures the distance among buses.\n\n\nconnecting two buses of a system as a link, and the electrical distance\n\nbetween two such buses as the value of the link\'s transfer impedance, we can\n\nreplace matrix  B  by the bus impedance matrix  Z  \n\nbus \n However, it is computationally impractical to calculate the smallest\n\neigenvalue of  Z   bus  and the corresponding eigenvector\n\nbecause, in general,  Z   bus  is nonsparse.\n as the bus\n\nadmittance  Y   bus  , which is very sparse, and maximizing\n\n S  in ( 2.7) is equivalent to minimizing the transfer impedance\n\nbetween buses within the same cluster.\n Y\n\n  bus  , and the solution is the eigenvector associated with\n\nthe largest eigenvalue of  Y   bus \n is large\n Consequently, in many cases, it is possible to neglect the\n\nresistances.\n by its\n\npurely imaginary part, hereafter denoted as  B   bus  .\n\n\n\n  r\n\n largest eigenvalues of  B   bus  represent the\n\ncoordinates of the buses on &beta;   r   .\n mathematical\n\nequation  ,  where  x   *\n\n   i   is the largest value of ( - log  10  |\n\n x  i   |), for all  i  = 1, 2, &dotted-line;,\n\n n  .\n Applying ( 2.9) to each component of each eigenvector associated with\n\nthe largest  r  eigenvalues transfers the coordinates of the buses\n\nsuch that distances are measured with respect to the order of magnitude.\n Moreover, the negative sign always keeps the data for these buses in\n\na positive coordinate.\n clusters is\n\nobtained by applying the  leader  algorithm [ 10] to the transformed\n\ncoordinates of the buses. \n\n  algorithm constructs a number of clusters\n\nof buses, a leading bus ( centroid), and a distance  TH  for each\n\ncluster, such that every bus in a cluster is within a distance  TH \n\nfrom the leading bus.\n The algorithm makes one pass through the transformed\n\nbuses-coordinates, assigning each bus to the first cluster whose leader is\n\nclose enough, and making a new cluster and a new leader for buses that are\n\nnot close to any existing leaders.\n and the leader of any cluster\n\nis defined as  , where  x  ,  y\n\n and &gamma; are the leader coordinates. \n\n  is selected such that it creates no\n\nmore than the required number of clusters\n As an example, suppose a three-dimensional placement of seven buses\n\nwhose transformed coordinates are as follows: \n It is required that the previous seven-bus system be partitioned into\n\nthree clusters.\n = 2,\n\nthen three clusters are created.\n = 4, only two clusters are created\n to 3, we ensure that three clusters are\n\ncreated, such that buses 1, 3 and 5 are placed in the first cluster, buses 2\n\nand 7 are assigned to the second cluster, and buses 4 and 6 are located in\n\nthe third cluster. \n\n\n  A popular class of algorithms for partitioning the nodes of a\n\ngraph begins with a random partition and tries to improve it by interchang\n\n<l> ing nodes, one at a time, between pairs of clusters in the partitition\n\n  [ 11] B.

{'text': 'For those with a taste for statistics the first fifty years of the\n\nRoyal Winnipeg Ballet could be counted in numbers of toeshoes beaten to\n\na pulp, of cities visited on five continents, of original ballets created,\n\nand of disasters that have periodically challenged the 26-member\n\ncompany\'s legendary stamina and pure grit.\n Impressive, but meaningless without the story of the remarkable\n\nhuman beings who have consistently breathed life into an institution that by\n\nall common-sense reckoning should never have happened. \n\n  First, let\'s take Winnipeg.\n No one would imply that the Prairie capital was a cultural wasteland\n\nwhen those redoubtable and very English ladies Gwenneth Lloyd and Betty\n\nFarrally arrived in 1938.\n There was music, there was theatre; above all there was a burning\n\ncivic pride.\n Even so, great ballet companies have traditionally emerged in larger,\n\nricher, more cosmopolitan and more strategically placed cities.\n Winnipeg was a long way from anywhere and even now when curious\n\nforeigners reach for an atlas to discover exactly where it is they must be\n\nstruck by the seeming improbability of such a city giving birth to a vigorous\n\ncultural flower. \n\n  Second, let\'s take Canada.\n Until Lloyd and Farrally decided to make a go of things in their\n\nadopted home nobody else had succeeded in establishing a permanent\n\nballet troupe here.\n There were attempts, of course - most notably by Boris Volkoff in\n\nToronto - but none that had the originality and vigour of the new\n\nWinnipegers.\n Canada in 1938, though receptive enough to distinguished ballet\n\ncompanies from abroad, was still unfertile soil for the growth of an\n\nindigenous dance culture. \n\n  Lloyd and Farrally turned both conditions to their advantage.\n If Winnipeg was isolated, they could forge a company that suited\n\ntheir environment; a robust troupe that would appeal to the people, that\n\ncould dance ballets about wheat and hydro-electricity as easily as it could\n\nrecreate the elegance of traditional toeshoes and tutus.\n If Canadians seemed content to patronize imported dance\n\nattractions, Lloyd and Farrally would deliver something different,\n\nsomething more attuned to the particular energy of a young, ambitious nation.\n\n\n\n  It took more than Lloyd and Farrally to bring these dreams to\n\nfruition.\n Although the Winnipeg Ballet ( it picked up the useful " Royal" title\n\nin 1953) can trace its formal origins to 1939 it could not call itself fully\n\nprofessional until a decade later.\n By then rival Torontonians were beginning to formulate plans for\n\ntheir own " Canadian" ballet company.  (\n To this day Celia Franca, founder of the National Ballet of Canada,\n\nmaintains that on her arrival in 1950 she was assured that the Winnipeg\n\nBallet had ceased operations.) \n\n  A tenuous first decade proved that homegrown dance could find a\n\nfooting against such odds as chronic lack of money and an inadequate supply\n\nof well-trained dancers.\n Even the disastrous fire of June 1954, which destroyed most of\n\nthe RWB\'s material assets - including the notes of Lloyd\'s many\n\nchoreographies - could not consume the ambitions of those who stayed to\n\nclear up the mess.\n This crippling, almost paralyzing disaster ushered in a\n\nturbulent period in the RWB\'s history that saw the final exodus of Lloyd and\n\nFarrally and the installation ( in 1958) of Arnold Spohr as artistic\n\ndirector.\n Spohr was a former company dancer, a tall, lean, elegant partner for\n\nthe Winnipeg Ballet\'s leading ladies.\n When American choreographer and director Benjamin Harkarvy shook the\n\ndust of Winnipeg from his heels just weeks before scheduled perfor <l>\n\nmances, the company board turned to Spohr for temporary help.\n The result was the best shows the RWB had given in years and Spohr\n\nwas persuaded to take up permanent residence.\n He stayed for thirty years and still has his own office in the\n\nimpressive new &dollar;10 million home the RWB built for itself in 1988. \n\n  Under Spohr the company began to attract international attention,\n\nbut it was another decade before the RWB\'s triumphant gold-medal-winning\n\nvisit to the 1968 Paris International Ballet Festival.\n Before that Spohr and his board of directors had had to deal with the\n\nthreat of extinction as the young Canada Council debated whether the country\n\ncould really afford three ballet troupes.\n Spohr, always a great believer in tradition and loyalty, had no\n\ndesire to wrench the RWB from the populist image it had enjoyed under Lloyd\n\nand Farrally.   \n Although the RWB presented Canada\'s first indigenous full-length\n\nballet (  Rose Latulippe  , with choreography by Brian Macdonald) in\n\n1966, the company did not tackle another full-length work until John Neu <l>\n\nmeier\'s version of  The Nutcracker  ten years later.\n For the most part Spohr stuck to the proven formula of a repertoire\n\nof shorter works that could be mixed and matched to create programs with\n\nbroad appeal. \n\n  The mixing and matching, however, was artful in the extreme.\n It was accomplished with one eye cannily focussed on audience taste\n\nand the other on the needs of the RWB\'s constantly improving ensemble of\n\ndancers.\n In this respect Spohr served both sides of the footlights well.\n\n\nplished at grabbing emerging choreographers - Macdonald, Vesak,\n\nNeumeier, Araiz - before they became too well known.\n He was willing to shock his audiences with the uncompromising realism\n\nof Vesak\'s  The Ecstasy of Rita Joe  , jolt their political\n\nsensitivities with Kurt  classic anti-war ballet  The\n\nGreen Table  or make an appeal to the youth of Canada with Neu <l>\n\nmeier\'s  The Game  ( set to a rock version of Mussorgsky\'s \n\nPictures at an Exhibition  ) .\n Spohr\'s vision of dance encompassed a range that also included the\n\nelegant dance-fordance\'s-sake of Dutch choreographer Hans van\n\nManen, the foot-stomping good humour of Agnes de Mille\'s  Rodeo  ,\n\nthe prettiness of Frederick Ashton\'s  Les Patineurs  and the\n\npoetic charm of Fokine\'s  Les Sylphides  . \n\n  The RWB embraced eclecticism long before other companies around\n\nthe world acknowledged it as a valid - and marketable - approach.\n Then, just when the RWB had been pigeonholed as the "\n\nsomething-for-everyone" company of mixed bills, Arnold Spohr set about giving\n\nWinnipegers the kind of multi-act spectacles that everyone had come to assume\n\nwere the prerogative of the National Ballet.\n\n\nGiselle  and most recently  Swan Lake  .\n The timing of these productions, as critics hastily pointed out,\n\ncoincided with the rise to fame of the RWB\'s most brilliant and bankable\n\ndancer, 1980 gold medal-winner at the prestigious Varna ballet competition,\n\nEvelyn Hart.\n Certainly it made sense to mount the kind of ballets that could do\n\njustice to Hart\'s talent and ambition. \n\n  In 1970 Spohr had encouraged former principal dancer David Moroni\n\nto develop a professional training program as an extension of the RWB\'s\n\ngeneral and profitable community ballet school.  \n When Hart felt smothered by the hothouse pressures of Toronto\'s\n\nNational Ballet School it was to Moroni that she had come for help.\n Both Moroni and Spohr looked to Russia for inspiration and through\n\nthe legendary teacher Vera Volkova, in her time the major exponent of the\n\nVaganova training system, the RWB\'s professional school began to produce\n\ndancers with a distinctly more expansive and dynamic way of moving than those\n\nto be found in either Montreal or Toronto.   \n\n  When Spohr decided to mount the big story ballets it was because\n\nthe company was ready for the challenge, because it had to prove itself\n\nin works that are still regarded as the acid test of a ballet troupe\'s clas\n\n<l> sical credentials.\n It was an antidote to those perhaps unintentionally patronising\n\ndescriptions of the RWB as  " prairie fresh"  and  "\n\nyouthfully exuberant"  .\n It was proof that the RWB was not somehow caught in permanent\n\nadolescence. \n\n \n\nSwan Lake  or  Giselle  with the same depth and finesse as the\n\nmuch larger seventy-member National Ballet.\n The RWB is still a company of individuals with a variety of\n\nphysiques that often run counter to the demands of pure classicism.\n Nevertheless, Spohr would never have produced these works if he\n\nhad doubted for a moment that his company could dance them with integ\n\n<l> rity - an integrity founded in total dramatic conviction and a sensitiv\n\n<l> ity to the nuances of style.\n The RWB dances the classics its own way, but they are still the\n\nclassics. \n\n  One of the dangers of artistic eclecticism as practiced by Spohr\n\nduring his thirty-year directorship is that the company itself never assumes\n\nan identity, that it remains faceless.\n Yet nobody who has seen the RWB perform would ever call it faceless.\n Even if it lacks a consistent physical style it has a distinctive\n\napproach to the business of performing that is strongly linked to the\n\ntroupe\'s populist roots.\n Where the National Ballet at times looks more concerned to\n\nimpress with its sheer magnificence, the RWB always evinces an insistent\n\nurge to communicate.\n It is a company with personality, with a winning stage manner that\n\nsometimes flirts dangerously with cuteness, that overtly sets\n\nout to entertain and that ( in David Moroni\'s words)  " never\n\nlooks down at its audience."  \n\n  Oddly enough, it is questionable whether that enduring\n\npersonality that survives the perennial flow of dancers, of staff\n\nchanges and even changes of director, could have happened anywhere else but\n\nWinnipeg.\n " there is a special commitment\n\nabout the people who come to work here.\n\n\n  Now, as it is celebrating its 50th anniversary, the RWB is having\n\nto endure one of the most emotional upheavals in its history, the cumulative\n\neffect of three deaths.\n One, that of co-founder Betty Farrally, is a symbolic loss; the other\n\ntwo, those of newly installed director Henny Jurriens and principal dancer\n\nDavid Peregrine, are of more practical consequence.\n Jurriens, who died with his wife in a car crash ( on the same day\n\nFarrally died of cancer), had already proved himself an exceptional leader.\n The dancers still feel genuinely bereft.\n The vision of the future shown them by Jurriens appears to have been\n\nsnatched away and the company must begin its second half-century under a veil\n\nof uncertainty.     \n\n  That future, however, became a little clearer on February 2, when\n\nthe Royal Winnipeg Ballet announced it had found a new artistic director to\n\ntake over immediately from interim head André Lewis.\n After an intensive search, the RWB\'s board of directors named\n\nAustralian-born John Meehan.\n As Meehan himself admitted, the company is taking a calculated\n\nrisk picking him since Meehan has no previous experience directing a ballet\n\ncompany.\n However, he has much else to recommend him.\n As a former star of the Australian Ballet and of American Ballet\n\nTheatre, Meehan won critical acclaim for the nobility and theatrical flair of\n\nhis dancing.\n Canadian audiences had a chance to sample this two years ago when\n\nMeehan starred with Karen Kain in a CBC-TV production of  The Merry Widow\n\n .\n Meehan, who turns 40 in May, says he has now retired from dancing but\n\nthe wealth of experience gained in a career that spans Broadway, London\'s\n\nWest End and even a stint on television\'s  The Love Boat  is certain\n\nto prove valuable as he takes over the Royal Winnipegers. \n\n  Those who know Meehan well describe him as friendly and open -\n\nqualities that should suit him admirably to the almost family atmosphere\n\nof Canada\'s oldest dance troupe.\n Meehan\'s task is to build on the traditions established by\n\nArnold Spohr and on the vision of the future offered by Henny Jurriens. \n\n  The Arts\n\nTonight.  \n\n\n\n Kevin Teichroeb personally shortens the distance from sea to\n\nshining sea  \n\n  There\'s a man with a mission at Theatrebooks, Toronto\'s\n\nperforming arts specialty bookstore.\n Manager Kevin Teichroeb wants to put information about the arts\n\ninto the hands of readers all over Canada.\n Travelling across the country revealed to Teichroeb a surprisingly\n\nhigh demand for Canadian material.\n " People are isolated because we make them isolated,"\n\n he says.

{'text': 'Jock Carroll got the assignment of a lifetime when he was sent to\n\nphotograph Marilyn Monroe on the set of Niagara.\n\n\n  It was over forty years ago on Thursday, June 5, 1952.\n Harry Truman was president, the Cold War had escalated into the Korean\n\nWar, the United States had set off its first nuclear bomb, and the popular\n\nsongs of the year were " Kisses Sweeter Than Wine" and Hoagy Carmichael\'s\n\nversion of " In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening". \n\n  I was about to have lunch with Marilyn Monroe.\n A few days earlier, Marilyn had descended on Niagara Falls, Ontario,\n\nwith a film crew of sixty, which included the actors Joseph Cotten, Jean\n\nPeters, and Casey Adams, and the famous director Henry Hathaway.\n\n\n  At my elbow a chubby film publicity man named Frank Neill was on\n\nthe phone to Marilyn, arranging a lunch for the Rainbow Room in the General\n\nBrock Hotel overlooking the Falls. \n\n  I heard him say, " All right, honey.\n He\'s here to do a photo spread for Weekend Magazine.\n That\'s the biggest publication in Canada.\n Fine, honey.\n\n\n  Hanging up, Neill turned to me.\n " She says she\'ll come right up.\n But that may mean one hour or two hours."\n He shook his head.\n " God knows what she\'ll be wearing.\n Here\'s somebody who\'s potentially one of the richest women in\n\nHollywood, and she\'s arrived here with practically no clothes.\n No clothes, but lots of books.\n\n\n  " Apart from that, I don\'t go out to nightclubs.\n I don\'t go out much at all \x97 even to premieres.\n The studio made a fuss when I wouldn\'t go to the premiere of All\n\nAbout Eve.\n They said it was a must.\n But they got over it.\n Sometimes, after putting in a good day\'s work, I can enjoy a glass of\n\nwine with friends.\n But I can\'t force myself into that sort of thing.\n And of course I read a lot."\n " What are you reading now?"\n " I\'m reading The Thinking Body by Mabel Ellsworth Todd.\n And I\'ve just finished Letters to a Young Poet by Rainer Maria Rilke.\n I read The Prophet.\n And I love Whitman and Thomas Wolfe."\n She looked at me.\n " What do you think of Wolfe?"\n Flustered, I replied, " Well, I think he\'s a great subjective writer.\n Maybe somewhat undisciplined.\n I read that he turns in million-word manuscripts and that his editor,\n\nMaxwell Perkins, has to cut them in half in order to get them to book size"\n " You\'d understand all that," said Marilyn, " if you read his book\n\nHow to Write a Novel.\n\n\n  Perhaps thinking that I would get lost in literature, Neill\n\naddressed a question to Marilyn.\n " Is it true what you said to Hathaway about the calendar?" Marilyn\n\nlaughed.\n " Yes, it\'s true.\n But it wasn\'t Hathaway."\n She explained to me.\n " They keep asking if it\'s true I had nothing on when I posed for\n\nthat calendar nude.\n Yesterday I said, ` Oh, no.\n\n\n  We all laughed.\n I asked, " If it wasn\'t Hathaway, who was it?"\n " It doesn\'t matter," said Marilyn.\n " If you want to use it, give it to Hathaway."\n She went on.\n " Funny how shocked people in Hollywood were when they learned I\'d\n\nposed in the nude.\n At one time I\'d always said no when photographers asked me.\n But you\'ll do it when you get hungry enough.\n It was at a time when I didn\'t seem to have much future.\n I had no job and no money for the rent.\n I was living in the Hollywood Studio Club for Girls.\n I told them I\'d get the rent somehow.\n So I phoned up Tom Kelley, and he took these two colour shots \x97 one\n\nsitting up, the other lying down.\n I didn\'t think I\'d done anything wrong.\n His wife, Natalie, was there during the shooting.\n I earned the fifty dollars that I needed.\n\n\n  The nude photo for which Marilyn was paid fifty dollars was sold\n\nby the photographer for\n\n$500.  The calendar manufacturer was reported to have made a million\n\ndollars when the calendar caught on. \n\n  Marilyn\'s lunch was interrupted by a procession of autograph\n\nhounds who pushed bits of paper and menus almost in her face.\n Marilyn obliged with a smile, but she observed in an aside, " I look\n\nforward to the day when I\'ll be free of all this."\n\n\n  As it was becoming almost impossible to talk, Neill called for\n\nthe check and we left the Rainbow Room. \n\n  For the next several days I dogged Marilyn\'s footsteps around the\n\nset of Niagara with a couple of Leica cameras around my neck.\n Picture opportunities were few but I came to be accepted as part of\n\nthe scenery by the crew and, more importantly, by Marilyn. \n\n  One afternoon I accompanied her on a publicity tour put on for\n\nlocal officials.\n She made presentations, posed for group photos, and did a dutiful\n\ntour of a local factory.\n Marilyn brightened up my factory photos by loosening the straps of\n\nher blouse, leaning over a piece of machinery to give my camera a good view\n\nof her breasts, and flashing her best smile. \n\n  Another day Neill arrived at my room with news.\n " Marilyn isn\'t shooting today," he said, " and she says she\'ll go\n\nout with you for colour shots after she\'s through with her hairdresser and\n\nmake-up man." \n\n  On our way to Marilyn\'s room, Neill said, " She likes you.\n Because you\'re taking time to get to know her."\n Neill seemed to think this was cleverness on my part, whereas it was\n\nsimply my lack of experience. \n\n  After the hairdresser and Neill departed for other duties, I was\n\nleft with Marilyn and her make-up man, Whitey, who went to work on Marilyn\'s\n\nface.\n Some time later the phone rang.\n " It\'s New York calling," said Marilyn.\n Whitey and I knew this meant Joe DiMaggio so we discreetly withdrew\n\nto the hotel corridor. \n\n  Whitey liked Marilyn and began talking about her.\n " She takes life pretty seriously.\n Have you noticed while she\'s sitting around on the set, she always\n\nhas a script in her hands?\n Well, she\'s not studying her lines.\n No, she has one of those deep soul books hidden in the script.\n Rilke, Franck, Freud, or maybe Emerson.\n She finds something in a book she thinks is true and she writes\n\nherself a little note about it.\n You know, ` You don\'t save souls in bunches,\' or, \'All life is a road\n\nof discovery leading to yourself."\n\n\n  " She wants to be right, all the time.\n They don\'t have much of a life, you know.\n Reporters or photographers all the time.\n If they go out in public, a crowd gathers.\n\n\n  Marilyn let us back into her room and began skipping about like\n\na little girl.\n " I\'m going to New York for the weekend!" she cried.\n\n\n  She put in a call to the director and, while waiting for him to\n\ncall back, ran around the room picking up clothes and a little hat and\n\nholding them against her while she examined herself in the mirror. \n\n  She groaned.\n " I haven\'t got a thing with me \x97 just slacks and a skirt.\n When they said Canada, I thought it would be up in the mountains\n\nsomewhere.\n Jean Peters lent me this suit \x97 but it doesn\'t fit around the hips,\n\ndoes it?\n\n\n \n\n  She dumped the clothes on the bed and grabbed the phone, talking\n\nexcitedly.\n She made another call.\n\n\n  When she put down the phone, she said, " They\'re passing the\n\nbuck.\n Hathaway says I can leave if the unit manager says I can.\n The unit manager says it\'s all right with him, but Hathaway will\n\nhave to take the responsibility.\n Neither of them will.\n And they promised before that I could go if I didn\'t have scenes\n\ncoming up." \n\n  She sat down and Whitey began working on her face again.\n " Whitey," she asked, " do you think I\'m being unreasonable?"\n\n\n  " Don\'t say so," said Marilyn, " if you think I am.\n\n\n  " I don\'t think you\'re unreasonable," Whitey replied.\n " But, on the other hand, I didn\'t think they\'d let you go, either.\n If the weather\'s bad tomorrow, they\'ll have to shoot indoors and\n\nthey\'ll need you." \n\n  Marilyn went to the phone again.\n " I\'ll have to put in another call to Joe and tell him they won\'t\n\nlet me come." \n\n  When the call came through Whitey and I trooped outside once\n\nmore, but this time we could hear her voice through the door - \n\n  " But darling!\n They won\'t let me come!\n Don\'t you understand?\n Don\'t you believe me, darling?"\n Her voice was distraught.\n\n\n  The call ended abruptly as though Joe had slammed down the\n\nphone.\n It was a long ten-minute wait before Marilyn opened her door again.\n\n\n  She sat down in front of the mirror and looked at herself.\n She managed a kind of smile.\n " I\'m sorry, Whitey, but I guess you\'ll have to do my eyes over\n\nagain."\n By the time Whitey had repaired her face the afternoon had almost\n\ngone, but Marilyn said we should take our planned drive.\n It was a beautiful sunny afternoon and I drove around the Niagara\n\npeninsula looking for a haystack.\n I had some naive idea that I needed one as a backdrop for a\n\ncolour photo.\n We couldn\'t find a haystack and in retrospect I realize I should\n\nhave just stopped anywhere and photographed her against a rail fence, a barn,\n\na field of grain.\n\n\n  After a while I looked over and saw that Marilyn had fallen\n\nasleep, curled up in the front seat beside me.\n I didn\'t have the heart to pursue the project any more that day and\n\ndrove her back to the hotel.\n She walked barefoot up the front steps of the hotel, carrying her\n\nshoes in her hand.\n\n\n  When I had parked my car and returned, the hotel doorman called\n\nme over.\n He was almost beside himself with delight.\n " When you let her out of your car and she came in barefoot, - she\n\nstopped in front of my desk to put on her shoes.\n "\n\n\n  Later that evening Neill caught up with me.\n " Well," he asked, " have you or haven\'t you?\n You have to admit I gave you every opportunity today."\n I began to explain that it hadn\'t been that kind of day, but he\n\nthought I was evading the question and interrupted me. \n\n  " Okay," he said, " you\'re not going to talk.\n Probably just as well.\n A good friend of mine with Associated Press was banging Rita\n\nHayworth regularly.\n When Zanuck [ head of 20th Century-Fox] found out, he had him barred\n\nfrom the lot.\n Permanently.\n\n\n  " Two grab shots," I said.\n " One trying on Jean Peters\'s clothes.\n The other of her walking barefoot up the steps of the hotel."\n " Well, better luck next time," said Neill.\n\n\n  I was having some success in getting candid shots of Marilyn\n\naround the set over the next few days, but little success in setting up a\n\nsession for a colour cover.\n It depended on her shooting schedule and sufficient time for her\n\nhairdresser and make-up man to prepare her for colour close-ups. \n\n  rest\n\nof paragraph  \n\n \n " The secret of a base," she said, " is to take most of it off.\n That\'s where most women go wrong."\n She applied witch hazel, then patted herself with tissue.\n " See?', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5b0147c5-678f-4f4c-9f88-09774fec1f97', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.808345+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9899557828903198, 'non_english_score': 0.010044217109680176}
{'text': 'During the early morning of 12 November 1838, Nils Gustaf von\n\nSchoultz crossed into Upper Canada at the head of a 190-man American invasion\n\nforce.\n "\n\ntyranny"  from North America, and the establishment of a domestic\n\nrepublican form of government for Canadians. \n\n  Their landing at a place called Windmill Point, located two\n\nkilometres east of the community of Prescott on the upper St. Lawrence\n\nRiver, was to be the launching of a  " bloodless liberation" \n\nof Upper Canada sponsored by an American group called the \n\nSociety of Onondaga County, New York.\n In the ensuing five days of fighting between Americans and\n\nCanadians, 37 men died and 89 were wounded.\n This attempted American invasion was an episode in the rebellions of\n\n1837-38. \n\n  Less than one month later on 8 December Nils von Schoultz was\n\nhanged and buried at Fort Henry in Kingston.\n Like others before him and since, von Schoultz came to learn that\n\nCanadians are different from their American neighbours.\n On the night before his execution, in a final letter to a friend, he\n\nwrote:\n Let no further blood be shed; and believe me, from what I\n\nhave seen, that all the stories that were told about the sufferings of the\n\nCanadian people were untrue.   \n\n  Nils von Schoultz was a tragic figure whose brief appearance on\n\nthe stage of Canadian history helped shape the development of this emerging\n\nnation.\n In the days between his capture and execution, he also came to have a\n\nsignificant impact on the political development of a future Canadian\n\nprime minister. \n\n  Nils Gustaf von Schoultz was born on 7 October 1807 in Kuopio,\n\nFinland, the second son of a circuit court judge.\n In 1808, during the Napoleonic wars, Russian troops crossed the\n\nFinnish frontier and his family fled to Sweden. \n\n  After the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1808 many officials and\n\nrefugees returned to Finland, but von Schoultz\'s parents chose to remain in\n\nSweden. \n\n  In 1821, the young Nils von Schoultz qualified for the Royal\n\nMilitary Academy in Stockholm where an older brother was already following a\n\nmilitary career.\n By December 1823, von Schoultz was promoted to second lieutenant in\n\nthe Svea Regiment of Artillery.\n In November 1830, he received an honourable discharge from the\n\nmilitary. \n\n  In early 1831 stories from Poland reached Sweden that told of\n\nczarist repression and of fierce resistance by students and cadets in Warsaw.\n\n\nters.\n One of these was von Schoultz who left for Poland in secrecy in 1831\n\nand plunged headlong into the defence of Warsaw. \n\n  Von Schoultz later made his way to France where he joined the\n\nForeign Legion in North Africa, moving on, in March of 1833, to join his\n\nfamily in Florence where his sister was studying music. \n\n  A year later he married Ann Cordelia Campbell in the English\n\nchurch at Florence.\n His wife was a member of a well-established Scottish merchant family\n\nfrom Edinburgh.\n The couple settled in Karlskrona, Sweden, where both their daughters\n\nwere born. \n\n  Von Schoultz tried to settle down to a normal family life as a\n\nbusinessman-inventor but does not seem to have been successful.\n In June 1836, he visited London on business.\n His family remained in Sweden.\n A month later, without telling anyone, he left for the United States.\n\n\n\n  While he officially gave his nationality as Swedish, von Schoultz\n\nbegan passing himself off as a Pole.\n He was known to everyone as a former officer in the Polish Army who\n\nhad been forced to leave his homeland by Russian oppressors.   \n\n  Von Schoultz became interested in the salt industry developing\n\naround the upstate New York towns of Syracuse and Salina ( Salina later\n\nmerged to become part of Syracuse).\n He came to have many friends in Salina, which was located near the\n\nCanadian border. \n\n  In December 1837 authorities in Upper Canada put down an\n\nattempted rebellion.\n Many of the leaders of this uprising fled to the United States where\n\nthey found sympathetic support for their proposals to liberate Canada from\n\nthe oppression of British colonial rule. \n\n  Throughout 1838, a number of forces operating out of the United\n\nStates conducted a series of raids and acts of piracy along the Canadian\n\nborder.\n Newspapers, local government officials and merchants in the border\n\nstates led the campaign to  " liberate"  Canada.\n Officials in Washington, under the administration of President Martin\n\nvan Buren, however, were more cautious, so these liberation enthusiasts had\n\nto operate under the cloak of secrecy. \n\n  One organization that sprang to life in 1838 was the Patriot\n\nHunters which formed hundreds of  "  Lodges"\n\n throughout the border states, recruited some 40,000 members and\n\nraised tens of thousands of dollars for the purchase of arms. \n\n  Lodge of Salina recruited von Schoultz to\n\ntheir cause.\n Von Schoultz, for his part, eagerly accepted the role of liberating\n\nCanada from what he believed to be the oppression of Britain. \n\n  One of the leading Hunters in New York state, John Ward Birge,\n\ndevised a plan to capture the British garrison of Fort Wellington\n\nlocated in Prescott.\n Directly opposite Prescott was Ogdensburg, New York, which was a\n\nhotbed of Hunter sympathizers.\n Birge believed that the seizing of Fort Wellington, one of the main\n\nBritish garrisons along the Canadian-American border, would prompt\n\ndissatisfied Canadians to rise up in revolt. \n\n  Birge began recruiting a force of some 300 men, arms and\n\nammunition, cannon, and vessels for this attack.\n One of those he recruited was the recently arrived Nils von Schoultz.\n\n\n\n  Through the summer and fall of 1838, the Government of Upper\n\nCanada heard reports from informants living in the United States regarding\n\nthe growth of popular American sentiment in favour of invading Canada and of\n\nthe buildup of men, money and weapons in American communities along the\n\nborder.\n The government began to re-build Fort Wellington, and to establish a\n\nnumber of militia units in communities near the American border. \n\n  During the night of Sunday, 11 November an American steamer\n\ntowing two schooners entered Canadian waters.\n The private invasion force assembled by Birge - who had given himself\n\nthe grandiose military title of  " Major-General"  - was\n\naboard these vessels. \n\n  Near Prescott, the lines to the two schooners were cut.\n An attempt at a surprise docking at the wharf in Prescott was sighted\n\nby residents who raised the alarm.\n The two schooners retreated into the waters of the river and then\n\nseparated. \n\n  At this point, the invasion of Canada by the Hunters became a\n\ncombination of organizational chaos and low farce.\n The larger of the two schooners grounded on a sandbar in American\n\nwaters.\n The smaller one, which had von Schoultz on board, landed on the\n\nCanadian side of the river at Windmill Point and began unloading its men\n\nand equipment. \n\n  Birge\n\nsuddenly developed what he claimed was a stomach disorder and abruptly\n\nretired from the scene.\n Others also decided to remain in Ogdensburg.\n More than one hundred insurgents never made it to the Canadian side.\n\n\n\n  Later that Monday, officials of the United States Navy arrived in\n\nOgdensburg and prevented any more attempts by American vessels to cross.\n By Tuesday, there was little communication between Ogdensburg and\n\nWindmill Point. \n\n  When the insurgents at Windmill Point realized that Birge would\n\nnot be joining them, von Schoultz was chosen as commander. \n\n  The American insurgents might have been more successful despite\n\ntheir appalling lack of preparation.\n While the landing at Windmill Point was totally unplanned, the\n\ninsurgents were fortunate to find a massive stone windmill some 20 metres\n\nhigh surrounded by several stone buildings.\n From the top of the mill one could easily reconnoitre the surrounding\n\narea for enemy troop movements.\n For an experienced military commander such as Nils von Schoultz, Wind\n\n<l> mill Point could have served as a perfect site for establishing a\n\nbeachhead on enemy territory until reinforcements arrived. \n\n  The British and Canadians quickly collected a large force of\n\nregular soldiers and militia numbering nearly 2,000 men.\n On Tuesday morning of that week the two sides engaged in a fierce\n\nrifle and musket battle.\n Finding the insurgents too strongly entrenched, the Canadians\n\nretreated to await the arrival of their heavy artillery. \n\n  As the week progressed, the situation for the insurgents\n\nbecame increasingly hopeless.\n The Canadians had not risen in rebellion against their colonial gov\n\n<l> ernment.\n In fact, the very opposite was happening as hundreds joined their\n\nlocal militias to repulse this invasion.\n Some of the Americans either escaped to the United States or were\n\ncaptured while trying to leave.\n Many suffered from wounds incurred in the Tuesday battle.\n\n\n  Although the insurgents held their position for five days, no\n\nreinforcements came.\n What was particularly frustrating for the hard-pressed American\n\ninvading party throughout the week was to look across the river and see\n\nthousands of Americans, most of whom were sympathetic to the cause of \n\n" liberating"  Canada from British rule, standing along the\n\nshorelines watching events unfold on the Canadian side.  \n\n   \n\n  On Friday afternoon, the British artillery began bombarding the\n\nAmerican positions.\n The insurgents began to either surrender or attempt to escape.\n Von Schoultz himself was captured late Friday evening as he hid in\n\nbushes along the river bank. \n\n  Many of the battles fought in 1838 between American raiding\n\nparties and the British/Canadian forces were little more than bloody\n\nskirmishes lasting less than an hour.\n The American invaders lacked the discipline of the British\n\nregular soldiers or the determination of Canadian militia members defending\n\ntheir own homes. \n\n  It is to von Schoultz\'s great credit as a military commander that\n\nthe rag-tag fighting unit he led ( some of whom were only 14 years old and\n\nnone of whom had any real military experience) held out for five days in a\n\ndesperate situation after sustaining heavy initial losses. \n\n  The prisoners spent one night in Fort Wellington.\n They were then transferred by steamer to Kingston and the military\n\nprison at Fort Henry where the government held its courts-martial. \n\n  A young Kingston lawyer, John A. Macdonald, had been retained to\n\ngive legal advice to one of the other prisoners.\n Macdonald met von Schoultz at this time and gave him some legal\n\nadvice for conducting his defence at his court-martial.\n\n\n  At his court-martial, von Schoultz made a distinct impression on\n\nthe British regular soldiers and others of his Canadian captors.\n As leader of the insurgents, von Schoultz assumed all responsibility\n\nfor the tragedy at Windmill Point.\n He made no attempt to defend himself except to say he had treated his\n\nwounded prisoners well.\n He never displayed any bitterness and refrained from censuring those\n\nwho had let him down with promises of reinforcements. \n\n  A total of eleven of the prisoners were executed.\n Sixty others were sent into exile to the penal colony of Van Dieman\'s\n\nLand ( present-day Tasmania). \n\n  The first of the insurgents to hang was Nils von Schoultz.\n As a mark of respect for his military background, von Schoultz\n\nwas the only one of the eleven to be hanged and buried at Fort Henry. \n\n  Throughout the time of his capture until his execution, von\n\nSchoultz maintained his posture of being a former Polish officer.\n It was perhaps essential that he continued to do so.\n The fact that von Schoultz had a Scottish wife and that he had\n\nabandoned her and their children would hardly have improved his situa <l>\n\ntion.\n It would probably have dissipated the respect he had been able to\n\ncreate among his captors as an honourable, albeit misguided, lover of\n\nliberty. \n\n  For more than 130 years, Canadian and American historians\n\nregarded von Schoultz as the former Polish army officer he had portrayed\n\nhimself to be.  \n It was not until 1971, when Ella Pipping, von Schoultz\'s\n\ngreat-granddaughter, published a biography on her ancestor that historians\n\nlearned that von Schoultz was actually a Finn by birth, a Swedish national\n\nand that, in fact, this " Polish" freedom-fighter had only spent some six\n\nmonths in Poland. \n\n  Macdonald drew up von Schoultz\'s will.\n Money was left to the Roman Catholic college in Kingston and to\n\nfamilies of the Canadian militiamen killed at the Windmill.\n He wrote a last letter to friends in Salina.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '91e774c1-f436-4fd8-bc6b-e9e9c0f141da', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.809568+00:00', 'english_score': 0.982883870601654, 'non_english_score': 0.017116129398345947}
{'text': 'BRAVE NEW BALLET: ideas and athleticism shape an exciting work\n\n\n\n  New York City-born choreographer William Forsythe says that\n\nnothing would surprise him more in life than  " no surprises."\n\n\n And when the National Ballet of Canada presented the world premiere of\n\nhis 25-minute work " the second detail" in Toronto last week, the surprises\n\nexploded in rapid succession.\n The uniformly grey set, designed by Forsythe, was reminiscent of a\n\nrehearsal hall - but at one point, snow began falling inside it.\n heads, a filmy white dress\n\nremained suspended in the air,  attainable  as a cloud, throughout the\n\npiece.\n Meanwhile, the choreography, both cerebral and daringly athletic,\n\nprovided surprises of its own.\n Now 42 and the artistic director of Germany\'s Frankfurt Ballet,\n\nForsythe has been hailed by critics as one of the most original interpreters\n\nof classical dance since George Balanchine, the Russian-born master of the\n\nmid-20th century. \n\n  Forsythe\'s decision to create a work for the National was a major\n\nhonor for the Toronto-based company - and a welcome respite from the\n\nrecessionary gloom that has been gathering around the troupe in recent\n\nmonths.\n Earlier this year, artistic director Reid Anderson announced that as a\n\ncost-cutting measure, he would not renew the contracts of five company\n\nmembers, among them two principal dancers.\n The company also cancelled plans to produce three ballets for a 1991\n\nMozart festival in Toronto.\n National Ballet officials predict that, even with those cuts, the\n\ncompany\'s accumulated deficit will mount to &dollar;2 million by the end of\n\nthe 1991-1992 season, up from the current &dollar;1.6 million. \n\n  Still, at last week\'s opening, the performers looked strong and\n\nadventurous.\n Forsythe\'s distinctive vocabulary of angular, ferociously swift\n\nmovements is already familiar to the company\'s dancers - his 1985 work,\n\nSteptext, entered the National\'s repertoire in 1989.\n one word\n\n</unclear> , risk-taking freedom to the diamond-hard precision of classical\n\ndance.\n Forsythe, who used to dance the classics in New York\'s Joffrey\n\nBallet, told Maclean\'s:  " A lot of my stuff doesn\'t look like ballet,\n\nbut only ballet dancers could do it."  \n\n  In person, the lanky, freckled choreographer is a mixture of\n\nbubbly humor and intellectual adventurousness.\n "\n\nM. C. Hammer is the greatest"  ) to French deconstructionist Michel\n\nFoucault\'s Archeology of Knowledge (  " a really groovy book"  ) .\n The eclectic nature of his creativity is readily apparent in " the\n\nsecond detail".\n For several minutes, a film of icebergs, underwear and other random\n\nimages is projected onto a blank wall, competing with the dancers for\n\nattention.\n The effect is distracting - but ultimately stimulating.\n For everyone involved, a Forsythe ballet is an exhilarating workout.\n\n \n\n\n EXISTENTIAL ACROBATICS: Robert Desrosiers choreographs a life\n\n\n\n  The best-known works of Toronto-based choreographer Robert\n\nDesrosiers have unfolded in a strange and spectacular dream world - a place\n\nwhere athletic dancers in elaborate, unearthly costumes cavort among the\n\nspecial effects.\n In Blue Snake, the choreographer\'s 1985 commission for the National\n\nBallet of Canada, a 30-foot-high giant\'s head gobbles up zebra-suited\n\ndancers.\n Incognito, which the artist created for the 1988 Calgary Winter\n\nOlympics arts festival and revised in 1989, combines surreal imagery with\n\nhigh-tech trickery.\n By comparison, his latest work for his own company is a surprisingly\n\nstraightforward piece.\n Jeux ( Games), which debuted last week at Toronto\'s\n\nPremiere Dance Theatre, is about the phases of human life from conception to\n\nthe grave.\n It is a production in which dance rather than spectacle is dominant.\n Unfortunately, the absence of spectacle is all too conspicuous: on\n\nits own, Desrosiers\'s choreography proves to be only intermittently\n\ninteresting. \n\n  " a\n\nportrayal of the cyclical nature of our lives,"  Jeux begins with two\n\nlovers conceiving a child on a billowing sheet.\n In an inventive scene change, the sheet becomes the wall of a womb,\n\nrevealing Desrosiers as the fetus within.\n He bursts through the sheet, simulating birth.\n In the rest of the first act, members of the Premiere Dance Theatre\n\nand guest artists from the Canadian Children\'s Dance Theatre portray\n\nsuccessive stages of life.\n " Life Carnival,"\n\n the narrative disappears and the relationships among the dancers\n\nbecome abstract.\n At the end, an old man totters onto the stage and dies, completing\n\nthe life cycle. \n\n  Desrosiers\'s choreography is dynamic, and his dancers are, for\n\nthe most part, equal to the punishingly acrobatic demands that he places on\n\nthem.\n But he relies heavily on a fairly limited range of swirling, churning\n\nmovements that eventually seem repetitive.\n Jeux\'s other major weakness is that the first and second acts bear\n\nlittle relation to each other; the finale with the old man seems <unclear>\n\none word </unclear> on and fails to draw the two halves together.\n Like the wizard of Oz, Robert Desrosiers looks disconcertingly human\n\nwhen he emerges from his arsenal of special effects.  \n\n\n\n\n  When Joanne Tod was a student at the Ontario College of Art in\n\nthe early 1970s, painting was a decidedly unfashionable activity.\n Making art with a video camera, or by arranging rocks on a gallery\n\nfloor - that was fashionable.\n And for those who felt compelled to paint, there was always abstract\n\nart.\n But in her large canvases, which often addressed thorny social\n\nissues, Tod persisted in depicting subjects realistically.\n Since the 1970s, such figurative painting has made a comeback - and\n\nTod, now 38, is one of its most celebrated Canadian practitioners.\n A major exhibition of her work opened recently at Toronto\'s Power\n\nPlant gallery, where it will be on view until Aug. 25.\n It then travels to Saskatoon\'s Mendel Art Gallery ( Sept. 20 to Nov.\n\n3), the co-organizer of the show with the Power Plant, and to the Winnipeg\n\nArt Gallery ( Nov. 29 to Feb. 16).\n The artist says that she does not regret having been out of step in\n\nart school.\n " It was a good experience because it put me in a position to\n\nbe contrary,"  said Tod. \n " I find it really interesting to put myself in opposition\n\nto other things."   \n\n  What is clear from the show, which features 20 large paintings\n\nfrom the past decade, is that Tod\'s work simmers with opposition to sexism,\n\nracism and absolutist thinking.\n Those topics have led many other artists into the mire of diatribe.\n But Tod has confronted such issues with engaging originality and, on\n\noccasion, mordant humor.\n Institutions including the National Gallery of Canada and the\n\nVancouver Art Gallery have acquired her work.\n And now she is starting to gain recognition abroad: in the fall, some\n\nof her paintings, which currently sell for between &dollar;15,000 and\n\n&dollar;35,000 each, will be part of a group show at the Thaddaeus Ropac\n\nGallery in Paris.\n Said Mendel curator Bruce Grenville, who put together the current\n\nshow:  " Anyone can be a flash in the pan, but Joanne has been\n\nproducing very strong, articulate work for 10 years."  \n\n  A vibrant, affable woman who rode her bicycle to a recent\n\ninterview with Maclean\'s, Tod recalled that she began drawing and painting\n\nduring her childhood.\n Raised in Mississauga, Ont., she was the only child of computer\n\ntechnician Andrew Tod and his homemaker wife, Georgina Tod.\n After graduating from the Ontario College of Art in 1974, Tod worked\n\nas an assistant in a private gallery for a number of years.\n But since 1982, she has been able to devote herself to painting full\n\ntime.\n The artist now lives in downtown Toronto with Bob Becker, a musician\n\nwith the award-winning percussion group Nexus. \n\n  While Tod\'s work has become more complex and less direct over the\n\npast decade, one constant has been her use of photographs as the basis for\n\nher paintings.\n Self Portrait, a 1982 canvas that is perhaps her best-known work, is\n\nderived from a 1940s advertisement showing an elegant, formally gowned woman\n\nposing on a flight of steps beneath a night sky.\n Calling the glamorous figure a self-portrait appears to be a simple\n\nact of fantasizing - except for one thing.\n In yellow letters printed over the figure\'s dress are the words\n\n "    beneath   my arm is the\n\ncolor of Russell\'s Subaru." \n That prosaic stray thought - it refers to the shade of a friend\'s car\n\n- stomps across the dreamy vision, challenging its outdated conception of\n\nideal womanhood without entirely cancelling out the image\'s nostalgically\n\nromantic allure. \n\n  In 1983, Tod turned that painting into a picture within a picture\n\nwith Self Portrait as Prostitute.\n In the latter work, the earlier painting hangs on the wall of a\n\ntasteful dining room.\n Clearly, the original work has become a commodity, something to be\n\nconsumed along with dinner.\n Tod now says that at that point in her career, she worried whether\n\nthe need to sell paintings would cause her to compromise her work.\n\n\n" it\'s in my best interest to have the financial autonomy that selling\n\npaintings makes possible.\n I haven\'t had to take jobs that would take away from my painting\n\ntime.\n\n\n  By the mid-1980s, Tod was dealing with race-related questions in\n\nher work.\n The 1984 canvas A Diamond Is Forever shows a well-dressed elderly\n\ncouple evidently posing for the camera in their own upper-class home - the\n\nwoman\'s hand rests on a table in a proprietary fashion.\n The picture would be a typical society portrait, except that the\n\ncouple is black.\n And that unexpected element forces viewers to confront their\n\npreconceptions about who belongs where in society. \n\n  For several years, Tod has been combining disparate, often\n\nperplexing images in her work, which on the whole has become more <unclear>\n\none word </unclear> .\n Tod says that Purple Heart, a massive ( 10 feet by 15 feet) 1989\n\ncomposition, was inspired by the massacre in Beijing\'s Tiananmen Square two\n\nyears ago.\n In the painting, a pair of intricately carved Chinese panels frame a\n\nclose-up of two traditionally decorated Chinese vases.\n Incongruously, a vertical row of chevrons painted in a flat, abstract\n\nstyle bridges a gap between the two vases.\n\n\n  Like much of Tod\'s work, the painting is a highly personal\n\nresponse to a larger event.\n " Something that\n\nstruck me was a news report about students throwing cans of paint at the\n\nofficial portraits of Mao." \n She added that among her own early works had been a series of\n\nidealized Mao portraits.\n The smears also recall the work of American abstract painter Morris\n\nLouis, while the chevrons allude to a shape repeatedly used by another,\n\nKenneth Noland.\n " In referring to those painters, I was referring back to my\n\nown education, and to when I made those Mao paintings with all this hope and\n\nidealism,"  said the artist.\n She noted that the combination of the chevrons and the smears in\n\nPurple Heart also suggested a spinal column and a rib cage:  " It\n\nanthropomorphizes the image and puts it back to the real thing that happened\n\nthere - mass killing."  \n\n  While it was Tod\'s contempt for a repressive political regime\n\nthat inspired Purple Heart, she opposes absolutism in all of its lesser\n\nguises as well.\n In particular, she balks at the kind of art that screams out its\n\nmessage without allowing any room for dissent or ambiguity.\n " I have gone through a really vehement political phase,"\n\n she said,  " but I never felt I was trying to be didactic in\n\nthe sense of saying  \'This is how I feel and this is what is right and\n\nthis is what you should feel, too.\'  " \n Combining passionate commitment and a questioning intelligence,\n\nJoanne Tod has a knack for probing unsettling issues.  \n\n\n A DECADE THAT ROARED: a Montreal show explores the manic 1920s\n\n\n\n  Perhaps more than any decade this century, the 1920s were years\n\nof social flux and artistic frenzy.\n The desolation of the First World War gave way to the machine age -\n\nand an acceleration in all aspects of life.\n It was the era of sprouting skyscrapers and Charles Lindberg\'s\n\nhistoric transatlantic flight.\n In the smoke-filled cabarets of Berlin, the crowded cafes of Paris\n\nand the steamy nightclubs of New York City, there was a frantic burst of\n\ncreative energy.\n A number of artists provided glimpses of the technological furture:\n\nGerman film-maker Fritz Lang\'s Metropolis ( 1926) and French painter Fernand\n\nLeger\'s industrial paintings visualized the  " robot,"  a word\n\ncoined in 1921.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '919acc4e-81ec-4db9-8891-e9cc00dabef6', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.810975+00:00', 'english_score': 0.970126211643219, 'non_english_score': 0.029873788356781006}
{'text': 'A SPECIAL SPIRIT: Jack Shadbolt combines intellect and passion\n\n\n\n  The people in the lineup moved slowly towards the elderly man\n\nseated at a table at Calgary\'s Glenbow Museum.\n Surrounded by 100 works collected for the first retrospective of his\n\ncareer since 1969, Vancouver artist Jack Shadbolt, 82, cheerfully signed\n\nexhibition posters and catalogues.\n An art student told Shadbolt that she liked his 1977 collage of 46\n\nbrightly colored butterflies entitled Homage to Vladimir II, a tribute to\n\nauthor-lepidopterist Vladimir Nabokov.\n he told her as he scrawled\n\nhis name across the poster, a detail of his 1978 landscape Wild Grass Suite.\n\n\n " I used bits of pictures from a bundle of fashion magazines.\n I knew fabrics because my mother was a dressmaker and used me as a\n\nclotheshorse."  \n After more than six decades as an artist and influential teacher, the\n\ndressmaker\'s son is now a revered senior statesman of domestic art.\n Said the retrospective\'s curator, Patricia Ainslie, the Glenbow\'s\n\ncurator of art:  " He is central to western Canadian art and was of\n\nmajor significance nationally in the 1950s and 1960s to Canadian art."\n\n \n\n  The Calgary show, called Correspondences: Jack Shadbolt, makes\n\nclear that its subject is an artist of both intellect and passion, a restless\n\ncreator who has mastered a wide variety of styles.\n The retrospective will remain on view in Calgary until Jan. 5 before\n\nit travels next summer to Vancouver, and then on to the Art Gallery of\n\nWindsor in Ontario and the National Gallery in Ottawa.\n The show traces Shadbolt\'s introduction to, and assimilation of,\n\nstyles including social realism, surrealism and abstractionism.\n Along the way, he found inspiration in such artists as Emily Carr,\n\nEdvard Munch, Paul Cezanne, Pablo Picasso and Diego Rivera.\n Yet the retrospective also demonstrates that early on, Shadbolt\n\nforged his own esthetic - a vibrant, sensual and urgent approach to his\n\nsubject matter, which has often included native mythology, and nature and its\n\ndestruction.\n " You don\'t\n\njust copy other artists - you move alongside to see if what they do can\n\ncontribute to your own resources."  \n\n  Shadbolt\'s rise to prominence - and financial success - was slow.\n he said in an\n\naddress to mark the Glenbow retrospective opening on Nov. 2. \n " Then, in the 1960s, I got a Canada Council grant.\n Then another.\n One award leads to another.\n I got the Order of Canada.\n Gradually, I became known as one of those western intellectuals who\n\ncounted."  \n Now, a commercial Shadbolt exhibition stirs collectors to a frenzy.\n Last February at Vancouver\'s Bau-Xi Gallery, buyers began lining up\n\nmore than 24 hours in advance for a show of recent works by the artist.\n Within 15 minutes, 23 of the 28 paintings were sold.\n A small Shadbolt work sells for about &dollar;6,000, while his larger\n\npaintings command between &dollar;30,000 and &dollar;50,000. \n\n  Shadbolt recalls that as a boy, he planned a career in commercial\n\nart.\n Born in Essex, England, in 1909, Jack Leonard Shadbolt was the second\n\nof five children born to sign painter and paperhanger Edmund Shadbolt and his\n\nwife, Alice.\n Jack was 3 when his parents moved to British Columbia, where they\n\neventually settled in Victoria.\n In his late teens, he committed himself to fine art and to teaching.\n\n\n\n  Over the years, Shadbolt taught art in a number of high schools,\n\nmoving in 1938 to the Vancouver School of Art, where he worked off and on for\n\n28 years, becoming a valued and influential instructor.\n He also travelled, working and studying in Toronto, New York City and\n\nEurope.\n During the Second World War, Shadbolt served in London as an\n\nadministrative officer for the Official Canadian Army War Artists Programme.\n One of his duties was to file and catalogue photographs that\n\nadvancing Allied soldiers had taken of the Buchenwald and Belsen\n\nconcentration camps.\n The war was a sobering lesson in human brutality, inspiring such\n\nbleak works as Dog Among the Ruins ( 1947) and Bird Image ( 1948).\n But Shadbolt says that it also helped him to understand abstract art.\n " A bomb hits a building, blows it up and then, in memory,\n\nthe pieces fall back together for an image of what it used to be," \n\nhe said. \n\n\n  In 1945, Shadbolt returned to Vancouver to work and teach.\n That year, he married Ottawa resident Doris Meisel, who went on to\n\nbecome an influential critic and art curator ( they have no children).\n Back in Canada, Shadbolt refined his artistic vision, cultivating the\n\nWest Coast influences that recur throughout his work.\n Many of his drawings and paintings echo the work of Carr, who had the\n\nyoung Shadbolt to afternoon teas in the 1930s.\n The Winter Barns ( 1936) is a moody, Carr-like evocation of a rustic\n\nscene.\n And Shadbolt pays explicit tribute to his mentor in the 1968 charcoal\n\nwork Hornby Suite ( Homage to Emily Carr), a brooding landscape. \n\n  Shadbolt\'s mature work shows him to be a quintessentially West\n\nCoast painter, immersed in the land and native mythologies of British\n\nColumbia.\n Said Xisa Huang, owner of the Bau-Xi galleries in Vancouver and\n\nToronto, which have represented Shadbolt for two decades:  " He made\n\nhis choice long ago to live and interpret things from a western Canadian\n\nperspective.\n\n But the artist also suffuses his works with a more universal,\n\npsychological resonance, as in Night Fears ( Fetish Series\n#12), a 1970 painting incorporating Inuit imagery, and in the surrealistic\n\nDarkening Foreshore ( 1989). \n\n  Huang adds that Shadbolt\'s failure to penetrate the international\n\nmarket is not a major concern for the artist.\n\n\nsaid the Bau-Xi owner.   " Instead, he is extremely interested in\n\nart and his own community."  \n Indeed, in 1988, Shadbolt and his wife set up the Vancouver Institute\n\nfor the Visual Arts, a foundation that offers financial support to young\n\nartists. \n\n  Huang says that Shadbolt is as prolific as ever.\n The artist\'s current studio works will be exhibited next February in\n\nVancouver and Toronto and, noted Huang,  " they will be abstract and\n\nfull of energy.\n\n\n  Throughout his career, Shadbolt has grappled with, in his words,\n\n " reconciling nature with abstraction, and deliberation with\n\nintuition." \n His art derives much of its power from that duality - its appeal to\n\nboth heart and mind.\n And Shadbolt continues to address those issues with an intense\n\ncommitment.\n says the artist in the\n\nretrospective catalogue,  " it is simply that the problem becomes less\n\nhow to paint than what to paint; to become concerned with a statement of\n\nauthentic response to the complexity of life." \n In his art, Jack Shadbolt makes that complexity both pleasurable and\n\nprovocative.  \n\n\n STRIKING ORIGINALS: celebrating a Group of Seven contemporary\n\n\n\n  Ontario-born artist David Milne had strikingly simple desires.\n " hills to sit on while painting\n\nother hills"  ranked high on his wish list.\n Primarily a landscape painter, Milne, who died in 1953 at age 71, led\n\na life that was hill-rich but cash-poor.\n In 1934, while living in a tar-paper shack near Georgian Bay, he\n\nattempted to sell his entire body of work, approximately 1,000 pictures, to\n\nVincent Massey and his wife, Alice.\n Asking price: &dollar;5 apiece.\n The future governor general and his wife did in fact buy 300 of them\n\nat that humble rate.\n More recently, however, one of Milne\'s paintings sold for\n\n&dollar;85,800.\n And last week, the largest retrospective ever of Milne\'s eloquent and\n\noriginal work opened at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg,\n\nOnt., 30 km northwest of Toronto. \n\n  The 155-piece show, which travels in January to the Vancouver Art\n\nGallery, co-organizer of the exhibition, and then in July to the National\n\nGallery in Ottawa, seems likely to consolidate the reputation of a\n\nlong-undervalued artist.\n Funded by Trimark Investment Management Inc., Amex Bank of Canada and\n\nThe Financial Post, the &dollar;1-million show includes watercolors, oil\n\npaintings and prints from major public galleries and private collections.\n " He remains for\n\nme an endlessly fascinating artist." \n Added Thom, formerly on the McMichael staff and now a senior curator\n\nat the Vancouver Art Gallery:  " In his pictures, he was constantly\n\nchallenging himself and doing the unexpected."  \n\n  But Milne has always remained in the shadow of his famous\n\ncontemporaries, Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven.\n His own approach to landscape was very different from theirs - or\n\nanyone else\'s, for that matter.\n While their bold canvases tend to celebrate nature in its full\n\nresplendence, Milne\'s art has a  wintry  , introspective quality, an\n\nintensity rooted in restraint.\n Partly because of the smallness of his pictures - many of them are no\n\nbigger than a place mat - they have brought relatively modest sums at\n\nauction.\n The record price for a Milne was set in Toronto in 1987, when the oil\n\npainting Temagami from Above the Railroad sold for &dollar;78,000, plus the\n\nauction house\'s premium of &dollar;7,800. (\n Emily Carr\'s works of similar size have sold for comparable sums;\n\nsome Group of Seven oil paintings have sold for more than &dollar;500,000.)\n Milne\'s art never shouts to be heard - but, as Thom told Maclean\'s,\n\n " if you really take the time to look at it, you will be rewarded."\n\n \n\n  Early in life, Milne learned to work hard and live frugally.\n Raised in Paisley, Ont., 180 km northwest of Toronto, he was the\n\nyoungest of 10 children.\n His parents, both Scottish immigrants, barely managed to support the\n\nfamily by running a home laundry and selling produce from their garden.\n As a young man, Milne taught school for three years in Paisley and\n\nsaved his money.\n In 1903, after borrowing additional funds from one of his brothers,\n\nhe moved to New York City to attend art school.\n After three years of study at the Art Students League, he remained in\n\nthe city, eking out an existence as a commercial artist. \n\n  All the time that he was painting signs and illustrating\n\nmagazines, he continued to work at his own painting.\n By frequenting the most progressive galleries, Milne came into\n\ncontact with the work of such influential French artists as Georges Seurat\n\nand Henri Matisse.\n Soon, his own work, which relied on the bright colors and animated\n\nbrushwork that Postimpressionism had popularized, was gaining critical\n\nacclaim.\n Five of his pictures were included in the 1913 International\n\nExhibition of Modern Art, a shock-of-the-new collection that enraged\n\nart-world conservatives and went down in history as the Armory Show, a\n\nreference to the building in which it was held. \n\n  But at the same time that he was gaining recognition, the\n\ndiffident and contemplative artist was restless in the city.\n He wanted to move somewhere less expensive in order to abandon the\n\ntime-consuming commercial work and focus wholly on his art.\n In 1916, Milne and his wife - he had married a New Yorker, bookkeeper\n\nMay ( Patsy) Hegarty, in 1912 - moved to Boston Corners, a village in the\n\nhills of Upstate New York.\n By the time he left the city, he had begun to develop his distinctive\n\npreference for subdued colors, applied so sparingly that areas of unpainted\n\nbackground showed through.\n It was in Boston Corners, however, that he truly came into his own as\n\nan artist. \n\n  A pencil-and-watercolor work from his first year here, Bishop\'s\n\nPond, provides stunning evidence of Milne\'s gift for capturing contrasting\n\ntextures.\n While the trees on the shore are scratchily depicted, the artist gave\n\ntheir reflections a fluid look by brushing a watercolor wash over the pond -\n\na beautifully simple idea, and one that is entirely consistent with Milne\'s\n\nphilosophical approach to his art.\n " simplifications of line\n\nand color intended to produce a thrill, a kick." \n " doesn\'t try to reproduce the\n\nthing before him: he simplifies and eliminates until he knows exactly what\n\nstirred him."  \n\n  Milne\'s Boston Corners years were interrupted by service as an\n\nofficial Canadian war artist in 1918 and 1919.\n The current retrospective contains an artistically and historically\n\nfascinating sampling of the paintings he executed in England near the end of\n\nthe First World War, and in France soon after the fighting had ceased.\n Better at portraying stark stillness than human figures in motion,\n\nMilne\'s most effective work depicted the war\'s desolate aftermath in such\n\nplaces as Vimy Ridge.\n " I never could quite decide if I was the last soldier of\n\nthe first tourist,"  he wrote with characteristic wryness,  "\n\nbut it was thrilling."', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '99d7e974-306e-489d-8b6f-c70f440df83a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.812275+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9781360626220703, 'non_english_score': 0.021863937377929688}
{'text': 'INFLAMMATORY SHOWS: Derek Goldby delights in provoking audiences\n\n\n\n  The current economic downturn does not seem to be hurting Derek\n\nGoldby.\n While many of his fellow freelance theatre directors wait by the\n\ntelephone, Goldby just keeps on working.\n He recently took his eccentric and highly popular version of Moliere\'s\n\nTartuffe from Theatre Calgary to the Canadian Stage Company in Toronto, where\n\nit runs until Oct. 26.\n Meanwhile, he has staged an off-Broadway production of Edmonton\n\nplaywright Brad Fraser\'s Unidentified Human Remains and the True Nature of\n\nLove.\n The 50ish Goldby is also preparing Chekhov\'s The Cherry Orchard for\n\nToronto\'s Tarragon Theatre, where it will run from Nov. 5 to Dec. 15.\n In the midst of all that activity, he and Canadian Stage artistic\n\ndirector Bob Baker are discussing the possibility of opening a school for\n\nCanadian actors. \n\n  Goldby is busy for the simple reason that he is considered to be\n\none of the country\'s best directors.\n Born in Australia and raised in Britain - he immigrated to Canada in\n\n1976 - he is also reputed to be arrogant and hard to please.\n Goldby, who works frequently in the United States and Britain, is\n\nopenly critical of Canada\'s theatre culture.\n " You cannot really become a star in Canada, you cannot reach\n\na point where you are held in real esteem,"  he said in an interview.\n "\n\nmiddle-of-the-road, safe actors, instead of actors who take risks.\n If you go to Stratford, you\'ll see some jolly good respectable\n\nacting.\n\n\n  Goldby\'s best productions - including last year\'s vibrant The\n\nImportance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde ( for the Canadian Stage) and his\n\ngripping version of August Strindberg\'s psychodrama The Father ( for the\n\nTarragon) - have often set the scenery smoking.\n He has a talent for giving a new, often disturbing edge to classic\n\nplays.\n He has transformed that pompous religious hypocrite Tartuffe, played\n\nby Brent Carver, from a 17th-century French Catholic into a contemporary\n\nevangelist in the Jim Bakker mould.\n He speaks with a southern drawl, and in the famous seduction scene -\n\nin which the supposedly pious Tartuffe makes torrid advances on a married\n\nwoman - he wears outrageous black leather pants with no bottom in them.\n The approach works - at times brilliantly.\n When Tartuffe\'s hypocrisy is finally exposed, Carver screams out his\n\nhatred while grovelling on a floor that Goldby has covered with peat moss.\n Rarely has the sheer animality underlying Tartuffe\'s pretences been\n\nso powerfully exposed. \n\n  Meanwhile, the critical response in New York City to Goldby\'s\n\nHuman Remains, now in an indefinite run at the 350-seat Orpheum Theatre, has\n\nbeen mixed.\n But so far, audiences are flocking to see it.\n " The play is going to be much more\n\ntested in New York than it was in Toronto [ where director Jim Millan\'s\n\nproduction ran for a total of four months in two separate theatres].\n In Toronto, a six-week run is a big success.\n But in New York, it has to go for six months or a year - in a much\n\nbigger theatre - before you can call it a hit."  \n\n  Goldby travels frequently to Britain, New York and his small\n\nholiday house in Morocco.\n But he keeps returning to Canada, and particularly to Toronto.\n - a state which\n\nhis inflammatory productions seem determined to change.  \n\n\n PRIDE AND REMORSE: an old woman grieves her way to\n\nself-forgiveness \n\n Adapted by James W. Nichol\n Directed by Brian Richmond\n\n  Hagar Shipley, the most prominent old woman in English-Canadian\n\nfiction, has taken to the stage.\n Played by Barbara Chilcott, the embattled heroine of Margaret\n\nLaurence\'s novel The Stone Angel appears in a new theatrical version that\n\nopened this summer at Ontario\'s Blyth Festival and is now running until Oct.\n\n6 at Toronto\'s Theatre Passe Muraille.\n Finding a dramatic equivalent for the interior monologues and\n\nshifting perspectives of fiction is always difficult.\n But in adapting The Stone Angel, playwright James W. Nichol has given\n\nHagar a credible second life.\n If she fails to fully satisfy, the fault is less with Passe\n\nMuraille\'s production than with the novel itself. \n\n  The play closely follows the book, which was written in 1964, 23\n\nyears before Laurence died.\n It begins and ends with Hagar dying - while she reminisces about her\n\nfailed life.\n Hagar\'s problem is that she has too much pride.\n It has ruined her marriage to Prairie farmer Bram Shipley ( Thomas\n\nHauff) and destroyed the life of her favorite son, John ( Elliot Smith), whom\n\nshe schemed to separate from his lover, Arlene ( Allegra Fulton).\n Fortunately, she grieves over her errors before she dies and so\n\nachieves a measure of self-forgiveness. \n\n  Director Brian Richmond seamlessly manages Hagar\'s movement in\n\nand out of her past.\n Chilcott\'s transitions to girlhood are particularly affecting.\n When Hagar\'s father ( Alan Williams) punishes her by striking her\n\nwith a ruler, Hagar\'s entire life is summed up by her brave but somehow\n\ninhuman refusal to cry. \n\n  Yet the play cannot escape the gothic sentimentality of the\n\nnovel.\n Most of Laurence\'s characters are caricatures, and not very original\n\nones.\n Hagar herself is a stereotype of the ranting, indomitable granny,\n\nfamiliar from countless pioneer epics - an impression underlined by\n\nChilcott\'s brassy-voiced delivery, which glosses over the true fragility and\n\nterror of old age.\n Despite much excellent acting from the supporting cast, The Stone\n\nAngel seems naive and old-fashioned.\n Although there is human truth at the core of the production, it lacks\n\nthe biting originality of the best theatre.  \n\n\n TRIUMPH IN EDMONTON: Lloyd Webber\'s latest work reaches Canada\n\n\n\n  Its producers say that it is the most popular show ever mounted\n\non an Edmonton stage.\n Nearly every day, they receive about 1,000 orders for tickets to\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber\'s Aspects of Love, which started a seven-week run at the\n\nCitadel Theatre on Sept. 4.\n By last week, the box office had already reached break-even point on\n\nthe &dollar;3.2-million production, after selling about three-quarters of the\n\n40,000 seats available.\n To have secured the rights to Aspects in the first place was a major\n\ntriumph for the Citadel and its director general, Robin Phillips.\n And Lloyd Webber, who attended the opening-night performance at the\n\nCitadel\'s 685-seat Shoctor Theatre, applauded the Edmonton version, which\n\nmoves to Toronto for a limited run beginning on Dec. 3.\n Attending a gala reception following the performance, the composer\n\ntold Maclean\'s:  " It is so thrilling to have a new production."\n\n\n Added the diminutive multimillionaire Englishman, creator of such\n\nmusical extravaganzas as Cats and Phantom of the Opera:  " It worked\n\nso well."  \n\n  For the 43-year-old Lloyd Webber, one of the century\'s dominant\n\ntheatrical composers with at least 13 productions of his musicals currently\n\nplaying around the world, it was a chance to breathe new life into one of his\n\nless successful works.\n Certainly, Phillips, 49, who became the Citadel\'s director general\n\nlast year after a high-profile career that included six years as artistic\n\ndirector of southern Ontario\'s Stratford Festival, has managed to\n\nreinvigorate Aspects by giving it a tighter story line.\n The musical first opened in London in 1989, where it is still\n\nrunning, but the New York City production closed in 1991 after a 10-month\n\nrun.\n It lacks the stage hydraulics and blockbuster antics of Lloyd\n\nWebber\'s other hits.\n But Phillips\'s talented international cast ( none of the leads is\n\nCanadian), which includes veteran Australian-born Shakespearean actor Keith\n\nMitchell, endows the production with passion. \n\n  Based on a 1955 novella by David Garnett, who was on the\n\nperiphery of Britain\'s famed Bloomsbury Group, the musical touches on the\n\nentanglements among five people over three generations.\n As it opens, the focus is on 17-year-old London theatre fan Alex (\n\nAmerican Ron Bohmer), who takes Rose ( American Linda Balgord), an\n\nimpoverished, older Parisian actress, to the retreat of his wealthy uncle\n\nGeorge ( Mitchell) in the south of France.\n George is away from the idyllic seaside villa, and the lovers help\n\nthemselves to his bed and his brandy.\n sings Rose.\n rejoins Alex, moments before George\n\nreturns - to fall in love with, and ultimately marry, Rose.\n Over the years, the sybaritic George, whose solution to life\'s\n\nproblems is a glass of champagne, has other romantic interests - including\n\nItalian sculptress Giulietta ( American Kelli James).\n Meanwhile, Rose becomes a leading actress and plumbs other aspects of\n\nlove in a brief liaison with Giulietta and nostalgic flings with Alex.\n Eventually, George falls on hard times financially and immerses\n\nhimself in paternal love for his daughter, Jenny, played by Toronto actresses\n\nMiranda de Pencier as the younger child and Lori Alter as the teenager.\n And, in a further convolution, when Jenny grows up she becomes\n\nenamored of her cousin Alex. \n\n  Phillips\'s control of the rebuilt musical is evident: the story\n\nis more lucid than it was in the New York version.\n And the director\'s use of just one set, which transforms almost\n\nimperceptibly from Parisian bar to train to villa through a series of subtle\n\nlighting changes, serves to highlight the music itself.\n " I used the set to open up Andrew\'s own colossal score,"\n\n Phillips said in an interview. \n " It is one of his best - intricate, deep and varied and\n\nsearingly accurate about the pain and pleasures of love."   \n\n \n\nnonprofit  Citadel with the high-stakes world of international theatre.\n " There is a terrific opportunity for a Canadian circuit for\n\nthis type of show,"  he said.\n " We must come up with new ways to present theatre,\n\nespecially now that government funding is not the greatest." \n Aspects was co-produced by the Citadel in partnership with the\n\nToronto-based Live Entertainment Corp. of Canada, which produced Phantom in\n\nCanada, and with Lloyd Webber\'s London-based Really Useful Theatre Co. Ltd.,\n\nwhich also staged the New York version.\n said\n\nLive Entertainment chairman Garth Drabinsky, who negotiated with Webber\'s\n\ncompany to secure the Canadian rights. \n " There is a vital implication here for all commercial\n\ntheatres that private and nonprofit sectors can fuse successfully on\n\nprojects."   \n\n  The brisk sales for Aspects are a welcome development for\n\nPhillips, whose first full season at the theatre also includes the\n\nShakespearean favorite Romeo and Juliet and the premiere of Calgary\n\nplaywright John Murrell\'s Democracy, about the American Civil War.\n But Citadel insiders say that many intangible benefits will also flow\n\nfrom attracting a big production by Lloyd Webber.\n "\n\nwonderful theatre space,"  said that he is anxious to stage another\n\nshow there.\n\n\n\n\n\n  For a moment near the end of Laurier, a ghostly presence\n\nelectrifies the stage at Toronto\'s Theatre Passe Muraille.\n Dressed and made up to look like Sir Wilfrid Laurier, one of Canada\'s\n\ngreatest prime ministers, Stephen Ouimette moves out of a spotlight and\n\nappears in vivid silhouette.\n For a magical instant, his resemblance to Laurier - with the high\n\nforehead and flyaway hair so familiar from the &dollar;5 bill - transcends\n\nmere imitation.\n It is as if the ghost of the dead politician had been caught in the\n\nact of manipulating events on stage.\n The best of Laurier has that kind of urgency.\n The fifth instalment of Toronto playwright Michael Hollingsworth\'s\n\nepic dramatization of Canada, The History of the Village of the Small Huts,\n\nthe play examines issues of Laurier\'s time that are of pressing concern now:\n\nQuebec\'s place in Confederation and the question of what it means to be\n\nCanadian. \n\n  Hollingsworth, 41, claims that post-Meech Lake anxiety helped\n\ntransform his play, which runs until July 21.\n In a recent interview, he told Maclean\'s that he had originally\n\nintended to write a farce about Edwardian Canada.\n But then, the constitutional crisis compelled him to explore\n\nLaurier\'s story more deeply.\n He discovered that Laurier - who was prime minister from 1896 to 1911\n\n- played a major role in shaping contemporary Canada.\n " We tend to think that it\'s institutions and social\n\nmovements that change the nature of the country,"  he said. \n " But it\'s these wild, wired individuals who make things\n\nhappen."  \n " Just look at Mulroney.\n\n\n\n\n  his dark glasses and black vest, Hollingsworth\n\nexudes the tough-guy air of a gambler who tells it like it is.\n He argues that if Laurier came back now and saw the predicament\n\nCanada is in,  " he\'d be so grossed out he\'d be speechless." \n In Hollingswoth\'s view, Laurier\'s greatest accomplishment was to\n\ntranscend the forces of racial and religious divisiveness that have always\n\nthreatened to tear Canada apart.\n " Laurier defined Canada as a multinational state that\n\nbelieves in liberty,"  he said.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'df20f3e2-e800-4d8b-86f3-20144a43c613', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.813700+00:00', 'english_score': 0.964720606803894, 'non_english_score': 0.03527939319610596}
{'text': 'ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT\n A REPORT BY GORDON NICKEL\n\n  In the midst of sharing God\'s Word at a Baptist retreat on the\n\nshores of the Mediterranean Sea near Alexandria, Egypt, I had to ask myself\n\nonce more what I had ever done to deserve this privilege.\n Beside me, my enthusiastic translator, a veterinarian from Assiut,\n\nrendered my English into a melodious Arabic.\n The Baptist young people sitting before me accepted the words\n\nthey were hearing as God\'s message for them.\n Through my northern European eyes, these Egyptian Arab evangelicals\n\nlooked very attractive.\n I felt it an honour to have them welcome me, a stranger, into their\n\nfellowship - never mind to have them invite me to preach! \n\n  Of course, I had done nothing to deserve the privilege, and that\n\ncame back to me again and again as I enjoyed a nine-day visit to Egypt in\n\nAugust, 1995.\n The entire trip was arranged by Samir Youssef, a Mennonite Brethren\n\nwho pastors the Arabic Evangelical Church in New Westminster, B.C.\n He had lived most of his life in Egypt, and only a few years ago\n\nimmigrated to Canada with his wife Lewiza and sons David and Martin.\n\n\n\n  Samir had come to Egypt several weeks earlier and had arranged\n\nthe schedule for us ahead of time.\n My son Matthew and I arrived August 21.\n We were on our way back from Pakistan, where we had worked for three\n\nweeks together with MB Missions/Services workers Tim and Janine Bergdahl in\n\nwitness to the Baluch people in Karachi. \n\n  Samir met us at the Cairo airport and took us straight to the\n\ncity of El-Fayyoum, where he was preaching in a Free Methodist church.\n After two evenings there, we overnighted back to Cairo for a meeting\n\nin a lively church on the poor side of town. \n Then we took the train to Upper Egypt for three days in Assemblies of\n\nGod and Presbyterian churches in Assiut and Tema.\n Finally we overnighted to Alexandria, for this Baptist\n\nretreat and for revival meetings in another Free Methodist church. \n\n  The Christians welcomed Matthew and me because they knew Samir.\n Samir has many friends in Egypt through his earlier ministry as a\n\npastor there.\n His father was a famous pastor and leader in the Presbyterian\n\nChurch in Egypt.\n I saw that Samir is greatly loved by a wide variety of Christians in\n\nEgypt, and seemed to know just about everyone.\n He is a fine evangelist and revival preacher, and it was great to see\n\nhim in action.\n Samir sings songs which inspire the people; when he preaches, he\n\nseems to have everyone in the palm of his hand with humour and emotional\n\nappeals, all the time taking full advantage of the beauty and rhythm of the\n\nArabic language. \n\n  We met several former professionals who are now in full-time\n\nministry because of Samir\'s encouragement.\n\n\npressed with their strength of character and their competence in ministry.\n Though they spoke in a very realistic way about the difficulties\n\nof being Christians in an extremist environment, they did not complain\n\nbut rather testified that God is blessing the church.\n During our days in Egypt, I saw a variety of very solid\n\nministries done by the evangelical churches, including Christian education,\n\nradio witness and follow-up, development of discipleship materials, and\n\ncompassionate ministries such as a large orphanage in Assiut. \n\n  Samir and I were glad to represent the Mennonite Brethren in\n\nEgypt, and during his stay Samir handed out to his church leader friends\n\nabout 1000 copies of the Mennonite Brethren Confession of Faith.\n When Samir had first accepted the MB Confession and joined the MB\n\nchurch, he had translated the Confession into Arabic.\n\n\n  Church leaders read through the Confession and responded in\n\nthoughtful, interesting ways.\n On one occasion, I was conversing with two young Baptist pastors, and\n\ntold them that Mennonites have traditionally not participated in war or even\n\nin military training. \n\n  " Do you still not participate in\n\nmilitary training?"  \n\n \n\nswered for us.\n This is no insignificant point for Egyptian men, who are required by\n\nlaw to take two years of military training. \n\n  Preaching 11 times in eight days did not leave a lot of time for\n\nthe sightseeing we wanted to do.\n But Matthew and I were able to see the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid\n\nat Giza, and we spent an afternoon at a resort beside Lake Qaroun near\n\nEl-Fayyoum.\n Later on in the trip, we were able to do a bit of shopping in\n\nAlexandria and take a dip in the blue-green waters of the Mediterranean\n\nthere. \n\n  On the last day of our time together, sitting in the living room\n\nof Samir\'s mother\'s apartment in Alexandria with a pleasant breeze\n\nblowing in through the open balcony doors, we reflected on the possibilities\n\nof European-background Mennonite Brethren and Arabic Mennonite Brethren doing\n\nsomething together in the Middle East. \n\n  " There are millions of people who need a ministry in\n\nEgypt,"  we agreed.   " Our goal is to bring people to\n\nJesus Christ.\n\n\n  Samir and many Egyptian evangelicals have a special burden for\n\nmembers of the Orthodox Coptic Church who do not yet have the joy of\n\nknowing Jesus Christ.\n When they speak of " evangelism", they normally have these people in\n\nmind. \n\n  Mennonite Brethren Missions/Services, on the other hand, has a\n\ndesire to expand its gospel witness among Muslims, the religious group which\n\nmakes up the majority of Egypt\'s population.\n It was clear from our explorations that this kind of witness\n\nwould only be possible through local Egyptian Christians themselves. \n\n  Considering an entry into a new region raises important questions\n\nabout how we relate to local churches.\n The Orthodox Coptic Church, for example, goes back to the time of the\n\nearly church, and it has been faithful through nearly 1350 years of Muslim\n\nrule.\n Another crucial question is how MB initiatives might relate to\n\nthe established work of Mennonite agencies in the region, such as Mennonite\n\nCentral Committee. \n\n  Samir and I didn\'t have the authority to make decisions in any\n\ncase; we were only there to explore.\n But that didn\'t stop us from dreaming together.\n When Arabic Mennonite Brethren open up windows for us into a region\n\nwhere we have not yet worked as a church, might these not at some point be\n\n<l> come doors of opportunity?\n\n\nlowships have led us into privileges of ministry which we\'ve done\n\nnothing to deserve.\n - Gordon Nickel, an instructor at Bethany Bible Institute in\n\nHepburn, Sask. and an MBM/S consultant on outreach to Muslims.  \n\n\n\n\n AIDS crisis imperils Botswana; MBM/S missionaries call for\n\nprayer  \n BOTSWANA\n\n  MBM/S missionaries in Botswana, Bryan and Teresa Born, have\n\nissued an urgent plea for prayer in September for the AIDS-decimated\n\npopulation of Botswana.\n The country has the highest rate of HIV infection in the world. (\n HIV is the virus which develops into AIDS, eventually resulting in\n\ndeath.) \n\n  In August, the Borns attended a gathering of ministers and health\n\nofficials where the grim statistics, say the Borns,  " broke our\n\nhearts and brought us to our knees." \n The numbers are staggering; they represent a horrendous toll of\n\nhuman suffering, grief and death that threaten to wipe out Botswanan society.\n\n\n\n  &bullet; 50% of the students at the University of Botswana - the\n\nonly university in the country - are HIV+.\n Barring a major medical break-through, almost all the infected will\n\ndie in 5-10 years. \n\n  * In the major towns and cities, 40% of pregnant women test\n\npositive for AIDS; many of the children will be born under a sentence of\n\ndeath. \n\n  &bullet; 25% of all persons over 15 are infected.\n\n\n\n  At the August meetings, the concerned Christians declared\n\nSeptember a month of prayer and repentance.\n Churches are being challenged to follow the pattern prescribed in II\n\nChronicles 7:14:  " If my people, who are called by my name, will\n\nhumble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways,\n\nthen I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal\n\ntheir land."  \n\n  Along with the call for national repentance, special events will\n\nbe organized in major towns and villages.\n " to take care of the sick\n\nand dying, as well as help the grieving,"  say the Borns. \n\n\n  The president of Botswana, Sir Keitumile Masire, will open the\n\neducational campaign on September 1 with a speech decrying rampant\n\nsexual promiscuity and embracing  " the biblical principles of\n\nabstinence before marriage and absolute faithfulness within mar <l>\n\nriage"  . \n\n  Meanwhile, the Borns need fresh energizing from the Holy\n\nSpirit. \n\n  " and\n\nat times we\'re exhausted and discouraged.\n Please pray for us; this is a battle for the hearts souls and lives\n\nof this people." \n North American Mennonite Brethren are urged to join the prayer\n\ncrusade and write a note of encouragement to Bryan and Teresa Born, Box\n\n10789, Selebi Phikwe, Botswana.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  For many years Zaire Mennonite conferences concentrated most of\n\ntheir outreach efforts in Kinshasa, Bandundu and Kasai provinces.\n In 1994, with the outbreak of ethnic conflicts in Rwanda, attention\n\nturned to eastern Zaire, first with humanitarian assistance and now for\n\nchurch planting in Bukavu, near the Great Lakes Region. \n\n  The three Mennonite conferences in Zaire, in collaboration with\n\ntheir partners, Mennonite Brethren Missions/Services, Africa Independent\n\nMennonite Missions and Mennonite Central Committee are sending two couples\n\ninto the region.\n In affirmation, the MBM/S Board has allocated &dollar;5,200 to share\n\nin this partnership. \n\n  Two features of the Great Lakes Project are especially\n\nnoteworthy. \n\n  1. The excellent advance work of two lay leadership couples al\n\n<l> ready involved in organizing a local congregation. &bullet;\n Fidel and Christa Lumeya were sent by MCC to work in the area as\n\ncoordinator of MCC program in the region.\n Before going to Bukavu, they were very involved in Kinshasa church\n\nlife of the Zaire MB conference. &bullet;\n\n\nshasa.\n This tent-making couple went to Bukavu with the blessing and\n\nfinancial assistance from their congregation and with the hope of planting a\n\nchurch. \n\n  Thanks to these two couples, a local international congregation\n\nhas fully organized in Bukavu with 50 people meeting each Sunday for worship.\n\n\n  2. Mission Training Through Local Structure.\n In addition, two Mennonite pastor couples are getting ready to be\n\nsent to Bukavu as the first missionaries to the region.\n Before starting, both couples are immersed in a nine-week training\n\nprogram especially designed for them by the International Missiology Center\n\nrun by Dr. Nzash Lumeya.\n Courses include Anabaptist history, history of the Great Lakes\n\nregion, history of African religions, cultural anthropology, biblical\n\ntheology of mission, conflict resolution, cross-cultural communication,\n\npersonality studies, church administration and group dynamics. \n\n  " We praise God for the work being started in this\n\nregion,"  declares MBM/S Regional Secretary for Africa, Pakisa\n\nTshimika. \n " The long term goal is to reach out not only to eastern\n\nZaire but also to Rwanda and Burundi."  \n The organizers ask prayer support for:&bullet;\n\n\ntion: Dr. and Mrs. Kalumuna; Christa and Fidel Lumeya; Mr. and Mrs.\n\nTshihuluka; Brothers Francois, Namuira, Nyamulinduka and Ange.&bullet;\n\n\nship training&bullet;\n\n\n&bullet;\n\n\n&bullet;\n peace and tranquillity in the region.\n\n\n\n\n John H. REDEKOP\n\n  During the 26 years I lived in Waterloo County, Ontario,\n\nthe Old Order Mennonites were a constant source of fascination, at times also\n\nof inspiration, and occasionally of disappointment.\n The fascination related to their dogged determination to retain a\n\ndistinctive and very old-fashioned lifestyle.\n The inspiration arose from their insistence on being a separate,\n\npeaceful people who practised authentic simplicity and mutual assis <l>\n\ntance, and avoided all forms of vengeance.\n The disappointment pertained to their preoccupation with exter\n\n<l> nalities, especially dress codes, their rejection of compromise on\n\nnon-essentials of the gospel, their adamant insistence on conformity, their\n\napparent indifference to the Great Commission, and their general legalism.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '33b38a40-fadf-4ea3-803a-e133a6edb751', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.815090+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9643683433532715, 'non_english_score': 0.035631656646728516}
{'text': 'roll kill the\n\nvintage art of Celtic fiddling?\n Not in Cape Breton, boys.\n\n Article by ALFRED LEBLANC\n\n\n  The Saturday square dances in West Mabou, on the southwest coast\n\nof Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, would be enough to make poor old Fa <l>\n\nther Kenneth MacDonald turn over in his grave.\n A century ago, the local priest fought to stamp out fiddle music for\n\nits devilish influence.\n Judging from the action tonight in this community hall, the music\n\nstill has the power to possess. \n\n  Michael Rankin\'s Reel\n\n , a yelp of glee comes from the floor.\n says 70-year-old\n\nDonnie MacDougall from nearby Inverness, pouring sweat from the last set. \n\n In the third figure of the square set, the men and women peel away\n\nfrom each other, forming facing lines the length of the hall.\n Then there\'s the swoosh and tap of shoes on worn plywood as partners\n\nstepdance back to each other.\n After the set, the dancers clear space for Margie and Dawn Beaton, 9-\n\nand 12-year-old sisters from Mabou, to show off their steps.\n They finish to a loud cheer and give way to 22-year-old Rodney\n\nMacDonald, who dances to spirited versions of  Miss Lyle  , \n\nDail in the Kitchen  , and other classic strathspeys and reels.\n After a little coaxing, even 50-year-old Alex Hughie MacDonald from\n\nJudique gets up and has a go. \n\n  Traditional Celtic-style fiddling, piping, and stepdancing are\n\nthriving arts in Cape Breton.\n In the summers, there are hundreds of square dances, concerts, and\n\nceilidhs ( parties) scattered about the island.\n The Ceilidh Trail, running along the west coast, likely boasts more\n\nmusicians per capita than anywhere else in Canada.\n It is a rich cultural soil that has nurtured such musical greats as\n\nThe Rankin Family, recent winners of four Juno awards, and 19-year-old\n\nAshley MacIsaac, an innovative young fiddler just starting a recording\n\ncareer that could push the Cape Breton sound onto the world stage and into\n\nthe 21st century.\n So strong is the local tradition that the island\'s musicians are\n\noften invited to give workshops in Scotland to coach the founders in their\n\nown lost arts.  \n\n  For every Cape Breton star who travels the world, there are\n\ndozens more musicians who stay home to play a vital role in local life.\n To an area that has been economically depressed for generations, the\n\nCape Breton fiddler brings self-forgetting joy.\n The unique driving pulse of the music leads irresistibly to the\n\ndance, which sets spirits free.\n says Patsi Palmer, who\n\nfell in love with Cape Breton\'s music and life and moved here from upstate\n\nNew York. \n " This music cheers people up.\n\n\n \n\nsilient spirit that has seen it through some rough times.\n Many of the tunes played by a fiddler such as 38-year-old Kinnon\n\nBeaton were imported by his forefathers when they first came from Scotland to\n\nCape Breton during the Highland Clearances ( the forced expulsion of\n\nsharecroppers) in the early 1800s, then passed down through the generations.\n ( Beaton\'s grandfather, Angus Ronald, and father, Donald Angus, were\n\nboth great fiddlers.)\n But during Beaton\'s own youth, fiddling became unfashionable.\n As I witnessed myself while growing up in the late 1960s and early\n\n1970s in Margaree Forks, television and rock  roll seemed to\n\nbe getting the upper hand.\n\n\n" The Vanishing Cape Breton Fiddler."  \n\n  recalls Father\n\nJohn Angus Rankin, one of the music\'s biggest supporters in recent\n\nyears.\n\n\ntinues,  " but they were in the woods.\n\n To prove his point, Rankin got 100 fiddlers on stage for the first\n\nGlendale fiddle festival in 1973.\n Since then, the music has made a comeback, slowly at first, then\n\nexploding in the past 10 years.\n " When I started, you were made fun of if you played,"\n\n says Beaton with a chuckle. \n\n\n\n\n  To sample the surviving heart and soul of the classic Cape Breton\n\nfiddling style, you could do no better than drop by one Thursday night at a\n\ntiny white parish hall at Glencoe Mills.\n It is to this isolated spot that Cape Bretoners drive for miles,\n\nthe last 10 along a dirt road, to catch Hugh " Buddy" MacMaster play.\n Dressed typically in slacks and a dress shirt, 69-year-old Buddy\n\nshows little emotion as he looks over his fiddle at a swirl of happy faces\n\ndripping with sweat.\n Though he has performed throughout North America and Europe -\n\nand has even taught at the Valley of the Moon School of Scottish Fiddling in\n\nCalifornia - this is his home turf; he has been working his magic here for 30\n\nyears. \n\n  Before this dance is over, Buddy will have played 150 tunes.\n He couldn\'t tell you how many he knows in total; there are simply too\n\nmany.\n Traditional Celtic Fiddle Music of Cape Breton\n\n , author Kate Dunlay ranks Buddy as  " one of the greatest\n\nScottish fiddlers ever to have lived." \n " There are so\n\nmany good fiddle players around today, they wouldn\'t miss me if I stopped\n\nplaying."  \n\n  What makes a great Cape Breton player?\n It\'s a combination of precise tricks with the bow, a rock-solid\n\nsense of rhythm that is perfect for the dance, and a rich repertoire of old\n\nScottish tunes and Scottish-style compositions by Cape Breton composers. \n While contemporary Scottish and Irish fiddlers are given to slurring\n\nthe bow, Buddy executes more notes with single, or articulated, bow strokes.\n He bounces his bow to produce several distinct notes without\n\nreversing direction or replaces some single notes with three " cuts" executed\n\nby rapid changes in bow direction.\n says\n\nBuddy of the manoeuvres he picked up from older players when he was\n\ngrowing up.\n Old-time Cape Breton fiddlers will also play notes to sound like\n\nbagpipes or play the same note on two strings at once to give a fuller sound.\n The result is music with great drive and lift.\n " If you\'re not dancing, you\'d better pinch yourself,\n\nbecause you\'re probably dead,"  says fiddler and Inverness\n\nnative Sandy MacIntyre. \n\n \n\ntening in on visiting fiddlers at  " kitchen rackets,"  or\n\nceilidhs, in his  home, then going to bed jigging (\n\nmouthing) tunes to himself.\n After starting to play at the age of 11, he soon advanced to\n\nperforming at weddings and parties and at 14 played his first dance for\n\nmoney.\n As an adult, Buddy spent 45 years working as a CN stationmaster, but\n\nmusic was his life.   " Even while I was at work, music was on my\n\nmind all the time."  \n He has played regularly since 1949, in summer sometimes almost every\n\nnight for weeks on end.\n Despite decades of persuasion by friends and recording studios,\n\nhe waited 50 years before putting out a tape:  " I didn\'t think I\n\ncould.\n I never had the urge to record.\n\n\n  In the hall at Glencoe Mills, Buddy is partway through John\n\nMorris Rankin\'s  The Way to Mull River Reel  when a slight smile of\n\nsatisfaction crosses his face.\n He has noticed 6-year-old fiddler Robbie Fraser sitting at the edge\n\nof the stage, looking up admiringly at his hero.\n Fifteen years ago, Carmelita and Angus MacIsaac brought their\n\n4-year-old son, Ashley, to soak up Buddy\'s music in this same hall.\n I still recall attending a dance there some nine years later.\n A new set was starting.\n The music was good, but it wasn\'t Buddy.\n I looked up to see a little fellow with curly brown hair, hardly big\n\nenough to hold the fiddle and looking awkward bowing with his left hand.\n It was Ashley - a future great fiddler pumping away for all he was\n\nworth. \n\n  If Buddy is all that Cape Breton fiddling has been, Ashley\n\nis poised to become its somewhat controversial future.\n He was raised as solidly as Buddy in the traditional style -\n\nstepdancing as a small child, taking up the fiddle at the age of 8, and\n\npractising like a fiend, sometimes till midnight.\n But he also received some formal music training, made his first\n\nrecording at 16, and moves readily from traditional duets with a pianist to\n\nmore raucous experiments fronting a rock-\'n\'-roll band. (\n During a typically furious performance in Halifax, he shocked\n\npurists by smashing and step-dancing on his fiddle.)\n While the music is everything for Buddy and he keeps his own presence\n\nsmall, Ashley seems to know instinctively that the music will get him only so\n\nfar.\n he says -\n\nand if that means changing the music, it\'s okay by him.   " If you\n\npick it up for the crowd in Chéticamp, they love it.\n If that is a cop-out, so be it.\n\n\n  " Picking it up" is what Ashley is doing the afternoon of\n\nChristmas Eve at Le Gabriel Lounge in the bustling Acadian village of\n\nChéticamp.\n Ashley is sweating profusely, both feet pounding the floor and his\n\nbody lurching.\n There is a loud cheer as he slips a few bars from a Christmas carol\n\ninto a traditional fiddle tune.\n " He kills his piano players,\n\nbecause he never stops." \n When he has worn out a few stepdancers who come forward, he gets up\n\nand stepdances to his own playing. \n\n  Ashley got his big break when he came to the attention of theatre\n\ndirector JoAnne Akalaitis and her husband, New York avant-garde composer\n\nPhilip Glass, who have summered in Cape Breton for years.\n " The music was flowing out of him as if it was the most\n\nnatural thing in the world,"  recalls Glass of his first listen to\n\nAshley.\n He and Akalaitis were putting together a production of Georg\n\nB&uuml;chner\'s  Woyzeck  for the Joseph Papp Public Theater in New\n\nYork and decided they wanted Ashley to fiddle and stepdance in it.\n " It was a big decision for us to let him go [ to New York],"\n\n says his mother.\n That move and the friendship he formed with Glass opened up new\n\npossibilities.\n He has already made two appearances at Carnegie Hall and has\n\nrecorded with the likes of Paul Simon.\n This fall, Ashley will release his own first major-label recording on\n\nA&M. \n\n  Some Cape Bretoners consider Ashley\'s new popularity a mixed\n\nblessing, fearing that foreign influences will corrupt Cape Breton\'s\n\nold-style fiddling.\n says\n\n79-year-old Joe Kennedy, as he takes a break from playing me some tunes in\n\nhis cluttered house deep in the woods near Inverside.\n Kennedy also objects to the flamboyant body language of fiddlers such\n\nas Ashley in full-flight performance.\n he\n\nsays.   " Now their bodies swing every way, so wild.\n Pounding away with their feet.\n\n\n  Beyond the obvious theatrics, the younger generation of Cape\n\nBreton fiddlers are also changing the music in subtler ways.\n Many now read music, and even more of them greatly emphasize precise\n\ntechnique and tonal clarity in their playing.\n " With the modern ear, there has been some streamlining of\n\nthe music,"  observes author Dunlay.\n And because of the easy access to other music through recordings and\n\ntravel, Cape Breton fiddlers now measure themselves against the international\n\ncommunity and are more apt to pick up outside influences.\n Irish fiddling, which can be very fast, has great impact.\n Noting the foreign feel of some of the playing of his talented\n\nniece, Natalie, Buddy McMaster says,  " She has been in with some\n\nIrish players."  \n\n  An overarching concern of the purists is that the newer players\n\nare losing the ineffable sense of rhythm that makes Cape Breton fiddling\n\nperfect for the dance.\n worries\n\nFather John Angus Rankin.\n " People are playing for the money.\n If a lot of people follow Ashley, they\'ll all get faster and\n\neventually the timing will get lost."   \n\n  Sitting in a hotel restaurant in Toronto, Ashley sips a Coke and\n\nshifts about like a puppy as if to shake off the criticism.\n " Those people who think I play too fast should listen to\n\nsome of the old recordings, especially those of Angus Chisholm,"  he\n\nsays, referring to a giant in the tradition.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '69728598-8440-494d-b4cc-49cbd581fbb0', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.816318+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9813296794891357, 'non_english_score': 0.018670320510864258}
{'text': 'The values of High Modernism are not quite as monolithic as\n\nthe Mendel Gallery\'s current exhibit of art from Emma Lake implies \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Workshops as the\n\ncentrepiece exhibition for the Mendel Gallery\'s twenty-fifth birthday\n\ncelebrations provides an appropriate occasion to consider the way in which\n\nartists, critics and historians have sought to construct the histories\n\nof Saskatchewan art since the nineteen thirties.\n Before discussing the exhibition itself, it is appropriate to consider\n\nbriefly how the art schools and workshops were organized and what their  and  particular agendas actually were.\n\n  \n\n  Organized artistic activity in Emma Lake had in fact begun\n\nsometime before the workshops dealt with in the Mendel exhibition, when\n\nPresident Murray of the University of Saskatchewan had established the Murray\n\nPoint School of Art in 1936.\n The idea for the school originated with Augustus Kenderdine, a\n\npainter and lecturer in art at the university, who directed the annual camp\n\nuntil his death in 1947.\n Kenderdine\'s own painting was based upon a European training in which\n\nthe prairie landscape was colonized and appropriated to accord with the\n\nideologies of western settlement during the nineteen thirties and forties.\n view\n\nof the northern lakes and forests effectively formed the basis for the\n\ntype of work produced by the students at the school, who included artists\n\nsuch as Joanne Gifford, Ingrid Kaldor, Isabel Kaldor, Ruth Roeher and Ruth\n\nPawson. \n\n  These individuals, many of whom were teachers, produced and in\n\nnumerous cases continued to produce work of considerable quality.\n This output has subsequently been largely ignored, mainly\n\nbecause of the increasing institutionalization and professionalization\n\nof the provincial art community ( the Murray Pointers were rarely " full\n\ntime" artists), and the growing hegemony of Modernist art practices - as\n\nopposed to Kenderdine\'s academic training - particularly in the art\n\ndepartments on the Saskatoon and Regina campuses. \n\n  This attitude that the Murray Point school was at best of passing\n\nsignificance, is reflected in the catalogue to the current exhibition.\n Here the extensive output and exhibiting activities of individuals\n\nwho attended the school is marginalized as being of " less importance" than\n\nthe later workshops, the production of " teacher artists" who are not quite\n\nof the appropriate status ( i.e., professional) to belong to a history\n\nof Saskatchewan art.\n " Beginnings: The\n\nMurray Point Summer School of Art 1936-1955,"  when taken with an\n\nunexplained token painting by Kenderdine at the beginning of the exhibition,\n\nindicates that the idea of an old fashioned evolutionary art history in which\n\ncertain " styles" and artists are valorized over others, is not entirely\n\nabsent from the construction put forward by the organizers of  The\n\nFlat Side of the Landscape  .\n In this case, the Murray Point school is represented as a minor\n\ncurtain raiser, a secondary event before the arrival of what another\n\ncatalogue essayist, Terry Atkinson, calls the  " grandees," \n\nthe famous artists bringing Modernist art to the prairies from New York. \n\n  Fortunately, a sense of the kind of work produced by artists who\n\nattended the Murray Point school before 1955 can be obtained from another\n\nexhibition -  The Forgotten Emma Lake  - currently on view at the\n\nGordon Snelgrove Gallery in the Department of Art and Art History at the\n\nUniversity of Saskatchewan.\n The exhibition is an initial study of the school, and contains work\n\nby the artists mentioned above as well as that of Mina Forsyth, who\n\nsubsequently became a full professor in the University Art Department and who\n\nattended the summer school subsequent to Kenderdine\'s death.\n The resulting exhibition, while by no means comprehensive, is an\n\nimportant first step in the retrieval of one of the early histories of\n\nSaskatchewan art. \n\n  During the years immediately following Kenderdine\'s death in\n\n1947, the balance of power in the two Saskatchewan university art departments\n\nchanged from an Anglo-Canadian one to a closer identification with the\n\nModernist influences being promoted by the powerful art interests in New\n\nYork.\n This was effected in Saskatoon by the new department head, Gordon\n\nSnelgrove, a promoter of Modernism and an occasional visitor to the USA,\n\nwho hired Nikola Bjelajac and the American artist Eli Bornstein to teach on\n\nthe faculty.\n They were followed later by a series of other American appointments,\n\nincluding Warren Peterson, Stanley Day and James Thornsbury, and by a new\n\ngeneration of Canadian-born artists, who like Otto Rogers and Mina Forsyth,\n\nor Kenneth Lochhead in Regina, were either trained in the USA, or looked to\n\nthat country as a useful centre of exhibition and museum resources.\n As a result of these events, the art institutions of the province\n\nwere, therefore, largely re-oriented towards and in some cases colonized\n\nby the USA. \n\n  Given these circumstances, it is not surprising that when Kenneth\n\nLochhead, the new director of the Regina College School of Art, proposed\n\na new two-week workshop at Emma Lake, he looked to outsiders and ultimately\n\nto New York for the workshop leaders.\n There was afterall only a tiny audience and an even smaller\n\nmarket on the prairies for the kind of work being produced by the Modernist\n\nartists.\n In order to establish themselves so far from the centres which\n\nsupported this form of artistic practise, they needed not only the helpful\n\nartistic influence of famous imported Modernist " stars," but also critical\n\nrecognition and gallery connections in Toronto, New York and elsewhere.\n It is the workshops which resulted from those needs which are the\n\nsubject of the Mendel Gallery\'s exhibition:  The Flat Side of the\n\nLandscape: The Emma Lake  Workshops.  \n\n  Beginning with Canadian leaders, Jack Shadbolt and Joseph\n\nPlaskett in 1955 and 1956 respectively, the workshop coordinators then\n\nturned mainly to Americans like Barnett Newman ( 1959), Jules Olitski ( 1964)\n\nand Clement Greenberg ( 1962), and British participants, notably Anthony\n\nCaro ( 1977) and Terry Atkinson ( 1987).\n From the long list of leaders who attended Emma Lake between 1955 and\n\n1989, John O\'Brian, the curator / editor of the exhibition, has selected five\n\nworkshops which for reasons which I will examine he believes to be "\n\npivotal:" those led by Shadbolt, Newman, Greenberg, Steiner and Dzubas /\n\nElderfield.\n This choice dictates the shape of the exhibition which is broken up\n\ninto five sections, each representing one of the workshops and containing a\n\nsmall selection of works produced at or near the time of those workshops.\n Accompanying the exhibition is an excellently produced catalogue\n\ncontaining five useful essays on various aspects of Emma Lake, together with\n\nentries on exhibited works, an extensive chronology, and a series of handy\n\nappendices listing the workshop leaders and participants - the Mendel Gallery\n\nhas excelled itself. \n\n  In fact the history of Emma Lake is due for just such an exten\n\n<l> sive reassessment, particularly at a time when recent workshops have\n\nshown an increasing tendency to become inward looking and self-referential,\n\nan act of closure which is common in art on the margins as well as an\n\ninherent condition of late Modernism itself. \n\n  What then does the exhibition say about activities of the\n\nworkshop, and how effective is it as an intervention in the histories of\n\nCanadian art?\n In his catalogue introduction, John O\'Brian proposes that the\n\nshow is intended to  " reclaim something of the complexity"\n\n of Emma Lake\'s history from the  " litter of anecdotes and\n\nillusions"  which surround the workshops.\n The complexity and the anecdotes certainly exist but they are often\n\nmore effectively dealt with in some of the catalogue essays than in the form\n\nof exhibition itself. \n\n  The clearest example of this difficulty lies in the selection of\n\nworkshops for inclusion in the exhibition.\n " observers"\n\n ( which ones?) felt that they were  " pivotal"  ( to\n\nwhom?), and yet at the same time reflected a  " sense"  of\n\ncontinuity in the workshops from one year to the next.\n Artists who were part of this continuity, who attended repeatedly,\n\nlike Knowles, McKay and Christie, were therefore spotlighted.  \n While the parts of this statement suggest contradictory situations -\n\npivotal after all implies a decisive change in direction - the opposite is\n\ncloser to the truth.\n Flat Side of the Landscape\n\n are those which first introduced Modernist practices at Emma Lake (\n\nShadbolt, Newman, Greenberg) and then reasserted that same ideology (\n\nSteiner, Dzubas / Edlerfield) on those occasions when its purity was either\n\nchallenged ( by Judd in 1968), or appeared to be diluted by the workshops of\n\nthe mid-seventies.\n The result is an exhibition which, far from showing the complexity of\n\nthe workshops, instead firmly situates itself within a Modernist selective\n\ntradition whose most distinctive characteristic is its attitude of\n\nclosure or exclusion with regard to other artistic discourses. \n\n  In the case of the Emma Lake exhibition, this means that the\n\nworkshops which do not fit into this tradition, or indeed were intended to\n\nease the logjam of Modernist ideology, are marginalized or ignored.\n These include workshops led by Donald Judd ( 1968), R.B. Kitaj (\n\n1970) and the mid-seventies series co-ordinated by Ray Allen, who sought to\n\nachieve a wider mix of approaches to the process of art production.  \n\n\nimportant, while the art community in the province was exposed to a\n\nfresh set of ideas.\n By the late seventies these kinds of workshops were probably more\n\nuseful than the specifically Modernist ones which reappeared in the eighties.\n O\'Brian\'s opinion of the importance of the latter is unclear,\n\nalthough his decision not to include any of the post-1979 workshops in the\n\n Flat Side of the Landscape  could perhaps be seen as a statement of\n\nhis own position. \n\n  The same flattening out of the meanings of Emma Lake also recurs\n\nin the choice of works for the exhibition.\n Because of the emphasis on the continuity and stylistic homogeneity\n\nof the workshops, the complexity of the activities which took place in the\n\nstudios at Emma Lake is lost.\n For example, John Nugent, a participant at the Shadbolt and\n\nGreenberg workshops, is not included because his work is " liturgical" and\n\ntherefore does not fit with the flat, non-objective ( and rather poor in the\n\ncase of the Greenberg session) paintings which were used to represent that\n\ncontinuity. \n\n  Similarly, the large number of women who attended the workshops\n\nare also at best thinly represented.\n While John O\'Brian rightly states that the project of Modernism\n\nfavours male control and effectively marginalizes women who are artists, the\n\nexhibition itself simply repeats this process.\n The work of relatively few women is included, and the catalogue\n\nessays do not address the problem effectively.\n The opportunity for a useful intervention in the discourses of Emma\n\nLake has been missed. \n\n  That this issue was, and is, an important one is evident from the\n\nresponse of a former participant, Andrew Hudson, who, in a panel discussion\n\non the exhibition, responded to a question of why so few workshop leaders\n\nwere women, by suggesting a round of applause for the wives of artists ( note\n\nthe gendering of artists here) who worked so that their husbands could\n\nconcentrate on success in the art world. \n\n  The result of the kinds of exclusion referred to above is an\n\nexhibition which seeks to represent the Emma Lake " tradition" as a series of\n\nmanoeuvers with the dominant aesthetic of Modernism.\n All the awkward edges are smoothed away and the triumph of the\n\ncritical theories propounded by the New York writer, Clement Greenberg,\n\nbecomes the central agenda of the exhibition; an agenda reinforced by the\n\npresence of paintings by the early  " grandees"  of\n\nModernism who were imported to lead the workshops.\n While this is only one possible representation among several, as\n\nO\'Brian with reference to Edward Said, the author of  Orientalism  ,\n\nremarks, it is nevertheless the only one which will be seen and which will\n\ntherefore be assumed to have stood for the " real" history of the Emma Lake\n\nworkshops. \n\n  While the exhibition is problematic, the accompanying\n\ncatalogue essays provide a more effective forum for addressing the issues\n\nsurrounding Emma Lake.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5471390f-0aa6-4ba8-abe3-f39f05efa68d', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.817634+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9717134237289429, 'non_english_score': 0.02828657627105713}
{'text': 'Those who still think that " " early music" "\n\nmeans dry, fussy performances on scratchy,  instruments\n\nneed only hear a Tafelmusik performance to understand how compelling period\n\ninstruments can be.\n Interest in " how Bach would have heard it" is only part of the reason\n\nwhy musicians like those in Tafelmusik, Toronto\'s baroque orchestra on period\n\ninstruments, have spent so much time and energy mastering the\n\nintricacies of the old instruments and why their annual audience of 50,000\n\nkeeps coming back for more. \n\n  The music of the 17th and 18th centuries was written to be played\n\non instruments constructed quite differently from those normally used today.\n In the hands of accomplished players these instruments almost\n\nalways make for naturally convincing performances, especially in terms of\n\nbalance and tonal blend.\n This is because they produce different sounds than those of\n\nmodern orchestral instruments: lighter and less imposing sounds, which are\n\nalso more subtle and colourful. \n\n  Now that period-instrument ensembles are firmly established\n\nin the musical life of Europe and North America, all that groups like Tafel\n\n<l> musik ask of a new audience member is that he or she take the performance\n\non its own terms and ask themselves: is the music pleasing or not?\n More and more, concert-goers who never expected to be captivated by\n\nsuch a seemingly esoteric approach are saying that it is very pleasing\n\nindeed. \n\n  In fact, once settled into the red cushions at Toronto\'s\n\nTrinity-St. Paul United Church, audience members find it hard not to be\n\npleased.\n The warmth of the surroundings matches the warmth of the ensemble\n\nonstage; there is no mistaking the fact that the musicians are having fun.\n Since the ensemble normally has no conductor ( music director Jean\n\nLamon directs from her place at the head of the first violins), the players\n\nmust relate to one another as they would when performing chamber music.\n The resulting involvement in the music is heightened by the\n\nfact that in most of Tafelmusik\'s repertoire each member of the ensemble\n\nis frequently allowed - even expected - to improvise ornamentation and\n\nnew melodic lines. \n\n  Tafelmusik is now entering its second decade with all the\n\nenergy and ambition that it had in its very first season eleven years ago.\n Although the orchestra is larger and many of its members have\n\nchanged, the drive to be the best and to show the world what it can do has\n\nremained constant.\n In the beginning the ensemble - founders Ken Solway ( baroque oboe)\n\nand Susan Graves ( baroque bassoon) with friends they gathered together -\n\nwere happy to play in whatever venues they could find.\n The move to Trinity-St. Paul in the orchestras third season brought\n\nsome stability to the ensemble, although the building seemed to mirror the\n\ngroup\'s situation: full of spirit but a little ragged at the edges. \n\n  The church\'s fortunes have improved with those of the\n\norchestra and now shining wooden staircases, long pews with red seat cushions\n\nand a refurbished \'backstage\' area all reflect the polish and success which\n\nhave come to Tafelmusik in the last few years under Jean Lamon\'s leadership.\n Where once the orchestra had to work hard to half fill their halls,\n\nthey now present each subscription concert two and sometimes three times.\n Run-out appearances around southern Ontario have turned into\n\nworld-wide tours to some of music\'s most prestigious centres.\n Most important, those heartfelt but sometimes scrappy early\n\nappearances have become thoroughly accomplished, energetic performances by up\n\nto 23 people as Tafelmusik\'s repertoire has expanded beyond the baroque to\n\ninclude the symphonies of Haydn and his contemporaries. \n\n  Of great importance is the fact that the core group of twelve\n\nstring players and one harpsichordist receives a full-time salary and is able\n\nto devote its entire attention to the ensemble, unlike most period-instrument\n\norchestras.\n In fact, San Francisco\'s Philharmonia is the only other North\n\nAmerican baroque orchestra that can afford to operate this way.\n\n\n\n  The schedule for Tafelmusik\'s current season shows the variety\n\nand careful planning which has always been the group\'s hallmark under the\n\ndirection of long-time general manager Ottie Lockey.\n Guest soloists include both world-famous performers such as\n\nthe conductor and harpsichordist Ton Koopman, besides less well known artists\n\n- like soprano Ann Monoyios - who are nonetheless first class musicians. \n\n  This season\'s programs include old favourites ( one of Bach\'s\n\nBrandenburg Concertos) as well as more unusual repertoire ( a concert\n\npresentation of Handel\'s opera  Floridante  ) and a performance of\n\none of the greatest and most difficult masterpieces of the Baroque, Bach\'s\n\n Mass in B minor  . \n\n  Tafelmusik continued its traditional heavy touring schedule\n\nwith a visit to several American music festivals in November 1989.\n They embarked on a cross-Canada tour in January and, to cap the\n\nseason, a three-week European tour ( the orchestra\'s fifth) in June.\n As well, a ground-breaking trip to the Far East is planned for next\n\nNovember. \n\n  These tours are important to the orchestra not only in financial\n\nterms ( unlike larger and more unwieldy ensembles, Tafelmusik\'s touring helps\n\npay the bills for its home-town concert series).\n They also bring the somewhat specialized world of period-instrument\n\nperformance to communities that would otherwise have little access to such\n\nmusic-making. \n\n  Tafelmusik\'s recent agreement to record for the\n\ninternational BMG ( formerly RCA) group on the Deutsche Harmonia Mundi label\n\ngives the orchestra the opportunity to reach thousands of new listeners\n\nall over the world.\n The infectious nature of the orchestra\'s live performances comes\n\nthrough on their first two recordings for BMG, six Concerti Grossi by\n\nArcangelo Corelli and Concerti and Symphonies by Luigi Boccherini with Dutch\n\ncello soloist Anner Bylsma. \n\n  Critical reaction to these discs has been very favourable.\n magazine comments that in the\n\nCorelli performances  " virtuosity and vitality are both present\n\nin generous quantities"  and chooses the album as one of the best of\n\nthe year, while Nils Anderson in  Fanfare  enthuses that the disc is\n\n " a joy from beginning to end"  and that  " the [\n\nrecorded] sound is broad and clean with fine ambience"  . \n\n  With the release of these recordings, almost anyone can now\n\nhave easy access to Tafelmusik, whether in concert at Trinity-St. Paul, on\n\ntour - or at home in front of the stereo.  \n\n\n\n  I picked up one of her books.\n .\n .\n " About relaxing, partly.\n\n\n  She stood up and began jogging up and down the room.\n she said.\n She let her wrists go limp and her arms fly about.\n Inside her white robe other parts of that marvellous body jiggled and\n\njounced around.\n I was so totally stunned by all this activity I didn\'t even think to\n\nraise my camera.\n I realized later that it would have been useless.\n I would have needed a motion-picture camera to record this memorable\n\nperformance.\n\n\n  Marilyn returned to her mirror.\n " Speaking of relaxation, I went to a Yoga church for a\n\nwhile. \n They teach complete relaxation, and there are a lot of good things\n\nin it.\n But I don\'t go for complete nirvana.\n They finally reach a state of desired nothing.\n Not now.\n\n\n  Marilyn stopped putting on her make-up and stared quietly out the\n\nwindow for a good five minutes.\n She had apparently been thinking about her childhood, for somewhat\n\nirrelevantly she asked,  " Was it Freud who said that parents are the\n\npsychological murderers of their children?"  \n\n  Marilyn\'s childhood had been an unhappy one: a father who\n\ndisappeared before she was born; a mother she barely knew, who was\n\nhospitalized for mental illness; an orphanage; a series of foster homes, one\n\nrun by religious fanatics and another where she was molested by an elderly\n\nboarder who gave her a nickel " not to tell".\n\n\n  Today, Marilyn chose to dwell on some of the happier moments.\n rest of\n\nlong quote   \n\n  She returned to her make-up, applying eye shadow to the top of\n\nher eyelids and soft pastel lipstick from a small jar.\n She fastened on false eyelashes, half-length, extending from the\n\nmiddle of her eyes to the outer edge.  \n\n  " I\'ll just give you\n\nthe last verse of one.\n\n O, Time Be Kind. Help this weary being To\n\nforget what is sad to remember. Loose my loneliness, Ease my mind, While you\n\neat my flesh.  \n\n\n \n\nroom to shed her white robe.\n She reappeared in slacks and a low-cut red blouse that buttoned up\n\nthe back, but was undone. \n\n \n\n\n  Marilyn propped herself up on her bed.\n " I have to learn\n\nto smoke a cigarette for my next picture.\n Give me a cigarette and you can take pictures of me practising.\n\n \n\n  she demonstrat\n\n<l> ed.\n Here\'s how I roll the cigarette from one side of my mouth to\n\nthe other with my tongue."  \n\n  She ran through pose after pose and I shot off a whole roll of\n\nfilm.\n For the final picture she leaned forward directly into the\n\ncamera - and winked one eye. \n\n  As we finished, there was a knock at the door.\n I opened it and found Frank Neill in an excited state.\n He looked at my cameras and before entering he muttered to me in an\n\naside,  " Boss, we got a big deal going.\n\n Having no intention of screwing anything up, I retreated to a chair\n\nin the corner of the room. \n\n  Alive with excitement, Neill turned to Marilyn.\n\n Hy Gardner wants to use you on his coast-to-coast show tonight.\n Along with Vice President Barkley.\n\n\n\n\n  said Marilyn.\n " But you talk to him first and find out what questions\n\nhe\'s going to ask me.\n\n\n\n  Neill picked up her phone and sat down on the bed beside her.\n It took some time for Neill to get through to New York and the\n\nconnection was apparently not very good because eventually he was\n\nshouting.  \n\n  Neill put his hand over the mouthpiece.\n " Honey, he says this thing between you and Joe is the\n\nhottest thing in New York - " \n said Marilyn.\n " I don\'t care!\n After all, this is my personal life.\n And I know Joe wouldn\'t like it.\n If he wants to mention Joe\'s name, I won\'t do it, that\'s all."\n\n \n\n  Neill removed his hand from the mouthpiece.\n " HELLO, HY?\n LOOK, HY, MARILYN DOESN\'T WANT ... YES ... YES.\n DON\'T THINK I DON\'T UNDERSTAND THAT, HY.\n I AGREE WITH YOU BUT ...\n\n He covered the phone again.\n\n " Sure.\n\n\n  Marilyn crouched on the bed and put her head beside Neill\'s ear\n\nso she could overhear Hy Gardner\'s voice. \n\n  " HY?\n YES BASEBALL IS OKAY, HY.\n WHAT? ...\n\n He spoke to Marilyn.\n " While you\'re talking about baseball, can he ask just\n\none question about Joe?"  \n Marilyn shook her head back and forth.\n While they huddled over the phone I took a picture.\n I think it was the first time I ever tried to photograph a telephone\n\nconversation.  \n\n  In the lull, Marilyn appealed to me.\n " Don\'t you think I\'m right?\n I don\'t want to turn my personal life into publicity.\n I know Joe wouldn\'t like it.\n\n\n  Neill covered the phone again.\n\n\n\n  long quote\n\n \n\n  " All right, honey.\n Neill soothed.\n He spoke into the phone again.\n " HY?\n NO ...\n YES, I AGREE WITH YOU, HY.\n BUT - NO.\n\n He handed the phone to Marilyn.\n\n\n  Marilyn took the phone.\n She listened.\n\n She listened some more.\n " I would like to help you.\n But not at the expense of someone else.\n No.\n All right.\n I\'m sorry.\n\n\n  She put the phone down.\n " He\'s going to skip it.\n\n Neill wiped a hand over his face.\n he said regretfully.\n\n\n  Marilyn became upset.\n she cried.\n " This is my personal life!\n They wouldn\'t ask Jean Peters about Howard Hughes!\n He wanted to ask me about Butch!\n I think that\'s terrible!\n I don\'t care that much about publicity!\n\n\n\n  Neill held up his hands to stem the flow of words.\n " Honey, it\'s perfectly all right.\n We\'re only trying to look after you.\n\n\n\n  A day or two later the three of us were together again.\n Marilyn finished work early and there was some time for a walk\n\naround Niagara for some sightseeing pictures. \n\n  Neill was full of ideas.\n " You could be buying some postcards.\n\n\n\n \n\nagara Gorge for close-up viewing of the Falls.\n\n\n  said\n\nMarilyn,  " but no photos.\n That\'s corny.\n Like in New York they say, \'Look up at the skyscrapers.\'\n Do they think you\'ve never seen a skyscraper before?\n I like pictures that have some warmth, some human quality to\n\nthem."   \n\n  After Marilyn had peered at the Falls, we continued our stroll\n\nuntil we came to a poster advertising the  Maid of the Mist  boat\n\nride.\n On the spur of the moment, Marilyn announced that she wanted to make\n\nthe boat trip.\n Neill said he had another appointment and he left Marilyn and\n\nme to make our way down to the  Maid of the Mist  landing at the\n\nriver\'s edge.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '3b49589d-7a05-4658-9b48-5d2c09e1f116', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.818918+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9781877994537354, 'non_english_score': 0.02181220054626465}

the surrounding mountain and ocean views, and the easy\n\naccess to Vancouver Island\'s rugged outdoors. \n\n  To outsiders, Victoria is well-known for its predictable,\n\nold-world charm.\n Canada\'s city of gardens, high teas, and heritage.\n " bit\n\n   of   England,"  which is,\n\nparadoxically, true and false. \n\n  A few of the heritage buildings are gone, replaced by new\n\ndevelopment, and some new ones are built to look old.\n Yet, to retain that Victorian flavor, considerable money is being\n\npoured into the restoration of significant buildings. \n\n  Two hundred of B.C.\'s heritage buildings are in the downtown core\n\nand many embellish residential areas.\n These old buildings are reminiscent of the city\'s beginnings in 1843\n\nas a Hudson\'s Bay Fort and as a gold-rush stopover in the 1850s and  .\n It was then that much of Victoria\'s modern-day appearance began to\n\ntake shape.\n The city centre now is charmingly irregular with cobblestone squares\n\nand Europeanlike alleys, an easy, pleasant downtown to wander.\n At the heart of the city is its harbor, where major development on\n\nits downtown side has been kept to a minimum. \n\n  Though development is most noticeable in the downtown core, it is\n\nhappening all over the region.\n In 1988, 8,642 building permits worth nearly &dollar;400 million were\n\nissued. \n\n  There is, the skeptics say, no real reason for the building boom,\n\nexcept to serve a flourishing tourist trade.\n Others disagree and say the development is healthy and will prevent\n\nVictoria from remaining a sleepy backwater town. \n\n  Today, some buildings that speak eloquently of Victoria\'s past\n\nare being brought back to life.\n The city\'s largest hotel, the Empress, has recently undergone a\n\n&dollar;45-million facelift.\n The 82-year-old landmark has been restored to reflect its original\n\nopulence, yet it is also modernized.  \n An addition, styled after the original building, has been built to\n\nprovide more rooms, a new registration area, a pool and recreation rooms.\n Older rooms have new wiring, new plumbing and new decor that reflects\n\nthe dignity of past eras. \n\n  Considerable sums were spent renovating the Crystal Ballroom,\n\nBengal Lounge, and Palm Court.\n In the Palm Court alone, &dollar;50,000 was invested into\n\nrefurbishing a striking domed ceiling with ornate plaster shields and stained\n\nglass that had been covered and lost in the 1960s. \n\n  A few blocks from the Empress is the new Eaton Centre, a\n\ndevelopment that has divided many Victorians.\n When it was proposed in 1986 by Cadillac Fairview, a Toronto firm,\n\nthere had been no increase in downtown retail space for 10 years.\n Instead of welcoming the company, normally quiet, uninvolved\n\nVictorians joined to fight the  " boys from Toronto." \n\n\n  Proponents said the massive new shopping complex would revitalize\n\nthe downtown core.\n Opponents said it would gut a block of the old town, wiping out 11\n\nheritage buildings.\n These included the Driard Hotel ( c.1892), which was the premier\n\nhotel until the Empress took over in 1908.\n It would also jeopardize those independent downtown merchants who had\n\nheld the core together for so long.\n Diverse groups of heritage lovers, merchants, and concerned citizens\n\nformed the Save Our City Coalition which collected more than 7,000 names on\n\npetitions. \n\n  Despite the opposition, Cadillac Fairview was permitted to build\n\nits &dollar;100-million, 150-store centre, and efforts taken to preserve the\n\n " old English"  look of Victoria.\n Through the sale of Broad Street, a downtown lane partially lost in\n\nthe development, the city made &dollar;1.9 million to put into a downtown\n\ninvestment fund for preserving and upgrading the heritage buildings that were\n\nleft. \n\n  The new Eaton Centre is built to look old, a four-story,\n\nbrick-faced structure with the salvaged facades of some demolished heritage\n\nbuildings.\n It even has imitation windows with venetian blinds painted on for\n\neffect. \n\n  Many heritage lovers were appalled.\n It was, they cried, a compromise that had nothing to do with\n\nheritage. \n\n  " It\'s a sad, obscene mockery of what was there,"\n\n in the opinion of Mark Madoff, Hallmark Society president and\n\nfounding member of the Save Our City Coalition.   " We would have\n\npreferred a good, modern design over what we got. We\'re sacrificing quality\n\nby putting up these pseudo-heritage type buildings. They don\'t satisfy\n\nanyone."   \n\n  It seems, however, shoppers, browsers, and sightseers don\'t\n\nagree: they\'re flocking around Eaton Centre, and there\'s no doubt that this\n\nstructure has added presence to the city\'s heart. \n\n  With the first phase of the Eaton Centre open, the second phase\n\nis due for completion in August.\n City planner Len Vopnfjord says it\'s the beginning of a trend for\n\ndowntown, and many, he adds, share his satisfaction with the development.\n\n\n\n  Though people may be split on the Eaton Centre, the new Victoria\n\nConference Centre has been well-received.\n Erected behind the Empress Hotel at a cost of &dollar;22 million, the\n\n1,500-seat complex takes advantage of the landmarks all around it: the\n\nEmpress, the B.C. Legislative Buildings, the Crystal Gardens, Thunderbird\n\nPark. \n\n  " The conference centre either shows these things up as a\n\nbackdrop or it incorporates elements of their design into its own design,"\n\n says Robert Amos, a local artist well-known for his watercolor\n\nstreet scapes.   " So there is harmony and resonance from one\n\nbuilding to another."   \n\n  With its large, outdoor plaza, towering atrium, cupolas and\n\ndomes, the conference is an example of a well-executed new design.\n It has restored the confidence of many discriminating Victorians.\n " Whoever heard of a major new building being erected lower\n\nthan the surrounding buildings,"  exclaims Amos.   " It\'s a\n\nbrilliant idea."   \n\n  " It has given us a different vision of what we can look\n\nlike,"  says Marilyn Callahan, director of the School of Social Work\n\nat the University of Victoria.   " In the past we\'ve looked at new\n\ndevelopments and found them wanting. Now we see they can be high-quality and\n\ntasteful and fit into the downtown ambience."   \n\n  That ambience, particularly on the waterfront, is changing\n\nquickly.\n Across the harbor from the Empress, the Songhees Indian land, once an\n\nindustrial eyesore, is turning into upscale condominiums and green space.\n When finished, there will be 1,500 housing units, a major marina,\n\nfloating restaurant, and 250-room hotel: total price - &dollar;75 million.\n The development includes a waterfront walkway from the Songhees land\n\nto neighboring West Bay. \n\n  Development on the Songhees land and in West Bay is adding a new\n\ndimension to an area considered  " on the wrong side of the ( Johnson\n\nStreet) bridge"  for years.\n However, a five-kilometre seaside promenade will soon join the two\n\nsides of the harbor. \n\n  Speculators now are looking to other parts of the harbor.\n Two sites on Wharf Street, between the Songhees land and the Empress,\n\nare being eyed as areas for an open public market, a new maritime museum, and\n\ntransportation facilities for passengers arriving by plane or boat. \n\n  Though development is being emphasized, heritage buildings\n\nare not being ignored, particularly on Government Street, which the Eaton\n\nCentre fronts.\n One of the oldest streets in the city, Government was the centre of\n\nVictoria 100 years ago.\n It has become a tourist mecca in recent years, with some shops\n\nstaying open until 11 p.m. during summer.\n Now, international retailers like Ralph Lauren clothiers are moving\n\nonto Government, giving the street an upscale feel. \n\n  Across from the Eaton Centre on Government, Munro\'s Books is in\n\na 1909 Royal Bank of Canada building.\n In 1984, after sitting idle for three years, the interior had become\n\nshabby.\n Owner Jim Munro refurbished it in just eight weeks.\n Today, original Corinthian-topped columns tower up the high ornate\n\nceiling.\n Stained glass and beautiful artwork shows above dark wooden\n\nbookshelves. \n\n\n  Lower Johnson, another key street in those early days, is also\n\ncoming back to life.\n During the Cariboo and Klondike gold rushes, Johnson was Victoria\'s\n\nfront door since boats berthed at its foot.\n Virtually everyone who arrived travelled up Johnson.\n Over the years, Johnson Street declined into a skid row.\n\n\n  In the mid-1970s, the Market Square project on Johnson was\n\nunveiled.\n Rundown buildings and an old ravine were turned into three levels of\n\nshops, restaurants, and offices opening onto a plant-filled courtyard.\n Today, Market Square is popular with residents and tourists alike,\n\nbut for some years it sat like a fresh new island in the middle of\n\ndecrepitude. \n\n  About four years ago, when developer Michael Williams turned his\n\nattention to lower Johnson, the area began picking up.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '76704c31-da72-43ea-a588-9e15559d9e32', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.820391+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9688999652862549, 'non_english_score': 0.031100034713745117}
{'text': 'Anchored amid the swirling mists and breakers off northwestern\n\nVancouver Island is a place so small and seemingly inconsequential it\n\nremains virtually unknown.\n But to more than one million seabirds, Triangle Island is British\n\nColumbia\'s greatest nesting colony.\n In a province with 27,300 kilometres of rugged and largely unpopulated\n\ncoastline, this remote island is the nesting place of one-fifth of B.C.\'s\n\nbreeding seabirds.\n Its numbers nearly equal those of the Queen Charlotte Islands\n\ncombined. \n\n  Located 45 kilometres northwest of Cape Scott, at the outermost of\n\nthe Scott Islands group, 85-hectare Triangle Island is on the marine highway\n\nto nowhere.\n The island served as a lighthouse station from 1910 to 1919.\n However, that function was all but useless, even though the\n\nlighthouse was, at 210 metres, the highest one on the coast.\n In 1912 a hurricane blew the well-secured tower over a cliff.\n Soon rebuilt, it was doomed to close because heavy fogs frequently\n\nobscured its light.\n Today only mice, voles, and rabbits permanently inhabit this\n\nforbidding island.\n Human visitors, thankfully, are as infrequent as sunshine.\n They are occasional fishermen seeking safe haven in Pacific storms,\n\nand researchers pondering the propagation of seabirds. \n\n  Each year, however, between April and September, a hail of birds\n\narrives from the surrounding North Pacific.\n in a frenzy to\n\nselect nesting sites, defend them from predators, and raise their chicks.\n Species include Cassin\'s and rhinoceros auklets, tufted puffins,\n\ncommon murres, glaucous-winged gulls, pigeon guillemots, pelagic cormorants,\n\nblack oyster catchers, bald eagles, and peregrine falcons. \n\n  About one million Cassin\'s auklets - more than 40 percent of\n\ntheir world population - are the first to arrive.\n They burrow under the tufted hair grass and salmonberry bushes that\n\ncarpet the green and brown landscape.\n Like some 84,000 of their rhino cousins, the stubby Cassin\'s auklets\n\ncommute each day from ocean feeding waters to hungry chicks waiting in\n\nburrows.\n They return under the protection of darkness, their unmistakable\n\nsilhouettes drawn in thick fluttering waves to the steep 210-metre-high\n\nhillsides. \n\n  remarks Ken Summers, 42, of\n\nAldergrove, who has conducted research at Triangle Island for four years. \n " They come in at night and know exactly where to go. When\n\nthey leave in the morning, you just hear the wind whistling through their\n\nwings."   \n\n  Cassin\'s auklets are the most prolific breeders among B.C.\'s 15\n\nseabird species, with as many as 400 separate burrows in a single\n\n10-metre-square space on Triangle Island. \n\n  Some 52,000 tufted puffins, the largest colony on the Pacific\n\ncoast south of Alaska, are active, even brazen, around their burrows during\n\nthe day.\n On congested breeding sites such as Puffin Rock, they circle, holding\n\nsilvery sand lance crossways in their beaks, orange feet trailing awkwardly,\n\nand distinctive locks of pale yellow hair flowing. \n\n  Crowded together on exposed rocks and cliff ledges, an estimated\n\n10,000 common murres stand penguinlike over their young.\n They lean into the rock, shrieking madly, guarding against airborn\n\npredators like gulls, crows, eagles, and falcons.\n Murres are well-adapted, perhaps too well, to cliff nesting.\n Birds that fail to breed continue with their normal nesting behavior\n\nas though nothing had happened. \n\n  " They\'ll bring in fish and lay them down, or go through\n\nall the motions of nesting, even rolling the egg over, with nothing beneath\n\nthem,"  says Summers.\n Protected from hunters on the west coast, murres remain traditional\n\ngame birds under Newfoundland\'s terms of Confederation in 1949, explains\n\nSteve Wetmore, B.C.\'s chief of migratory birds for the Canadian Wildlife\n\nService. \n " They\'re shot by the boatload on the east coast.\n\n\n \n\n  Elsewhere on Triangle Island, wide-eyed gull chicks huddle on the\n\nuppermost ledges, sizing up the lethal surf below, preparing for a first\n\nflight.\n On nearby rocks, cormorants stand with waterlogged wings\n\noutstretched, as if in worship to the setting sun.\n And, with Triangle Island being one of four breeding rookeries in\n\nB.C., up to 800 Steller\'s sea lions writhe about in harems, protecting their\n\nwrinkled pups with an incessant chorus of barks and belches. \n\n  That this treeless, windblown refuge has continued to thrive\n\nwhile some other key seabird sites in B.C. have declined is due as much to\n\nits geographic isolation as its prime breeding habitat and abundant marine\n\nlife.\n To date it has avoided the disruption facing nesting sites in the\n\nnewly created South Moresby National Park Reserve, namely from introduced\n\nrats and raccoons, recreational boaters, and uneducated nature lovers. \n\n  Triangle Island also receives some provincial protection as the\n\nAnne Vallee Ecological Reserve, named after a University of British Columbia\n\nmaster\'s student from Québec who fell to her death in 1982.\n The province issues visitor permits only for scientific and\n\neducational purposes, although lack of enforcement staff and penalties makes\n\nconformance largely voluntary. \n\n  The ineffectiveness of current regulations protecting B.C.\n\nnesting sites was shown during an 875,000-litre spill of bunker C fuel oil in\n\nDecember, 1988, from the  Nestucca  barge off Grays Harbor, Wash.\n\n \n Oil from the barge drifted northward into Canadian waters against the\n\nprediction of the U.S. Coast Guard, fouling Vancouver Island\'s west coast and\n\nclosing commercial shellfish harvesting.\n At least 12,500 seabirds - more than three-quarters of them common\n\nmurres - were found dead in B.C. and Washington, although the actual kill may\n\nbe closer to 50,000 birds. \n\n  Isolated, fist-sized blobs of oil floated with the prevailing\n\ncurrents as far as Triangle Island, more than 500 kilometres north of the\n\nspill site.\n The experience made a mockery of a federal 10-kilometre exclusion\n\nzone around seabird colonies and other land sites in the event offshore oil\n\ndrilling proceeds on the west coast.\n A final decision on drilling awaits a five-year moratorium imposed by\n\nthe B.C. government in March, 1989, shortly after the  Nestucca \n\nspill. \n\n  Concerned about the spill\'s impact on Triangle Island, the\n\nCanadian Wildlife Service hired Summers and fellow researcher Michael Rodway,\n\n38, of Ladner, to conduct a &dollar;72,000 census of the nesting seabirds\n\nlast summer. \n\n  Dividing the island into sample plots, they scour its surface on\n\nhands and knees, checking for egg shells, feces, and feathers that mark an\n\nactive burrow. \n Sometimes they ferret out chicks to determine breeding success.\n They also photograph rock cliffs from a five-metre-long inflatable\n\ncraft, using a telephoto lens, <unclear> unclear word </unclear> counting the\n\nadult birds by putting the photos under a binocular microscope. \n\n \n\nsays Rodway, staggering to focus his lens and pointing to the waterfall of\n\nguano pouring off a crowded ledge.\n As Summers works the outboard motor against the rising ocean swells,\n\nRodway watches the young murres and adds:  " At 20 days, they jump off\n\nthe cliff.\n The males lead them out, and the females, needing to build up their\n\nreserves, stay for a couple of extra days."  \n\n  The luxury of studying such abundant wildlife has its own\n\nproblems.\n For example, getting the information without disrupting your subjects\n\ncan be nerve-wracking.\n The island is like a mine field.\n A heavy foot can easily collapse shallow burrows, squishing the chick\n\nor exposing it to predators.\n Researchers made amends by carrying around tiny wooden shingles for\n\nquick repairs.\n Even approaching too close while photographing the cliffs can spook\n\nentire colonies of murres: they tend to exit en masse, like crowds after a\n\nconcert, and leave their young undefended. \n\n  While the federal study shows total populations are healthy on\n\nTriangle Island, the virtual breeding failure of some 2,000  murres \n\non nearby Castle Rock is possibly linked to the oil spill. \n\n  Despite the ever-present threat of oil spills and the\n\nundetermined impact of both high seas and inshore gill-net fishing, the  future on Triangle Island looks stable, provided humans keep\n\naway  .\n\n  Bird research on the island is still in its infancy.\n Experience at other irreplaceable wildlife sites, most notably the\n\nkiller whales rubbing beaches at Robson Bight on northern Vancouver Island,\n\nshow even small-scale public viewing has a negative impact. \n\n  In the meantime, the public must be content with seabirds serving\n\na more practical purpose - providing an early-warning system to environmental\n\nproblems that could affect man. \n\n  " Often they are the first indication of something going\n\nwrong with the food chain,"  notes Steve Wetmore, holding a gull\n\nchick which will probably spend the winter at a garbage dump rather than at\n\nthe remote landscape where it was born.  \n\n\n\n Photography by Karl Spreitz\n\n  The town of Osoyoos bears a revolutionary message for all British\n\nColumbia communities, especially those which are always trying to attract a\n\nbig-industry panacea, like a pulp mill.\n The message comes in a promotional videotape the Okanagan Valley town\n\nhas produced after it had learned its own hard historical lessons. \n\n  The tape opens with a re-creation of gold rushers coming into the\n\narea during the last century, all looking for that elusive pot of gold in\n\ncreek beds.\n They don\'t find it.\n Then they wake up to the realization that the real gold is all around\n\nthem.\n It\'s the environment.\n It\'s the beauty of the land.\n It\'s the fresh air.\n It\'s the fresh water.\n It\'s the warm climate.\n\n\n  Recent generations in Osoyoos have had to relearn this lesson.\n prey to the same illusion, but in other\n\nform.\n We must, they had said to themselves, attract the pot of gold to us.\n We must seek industrial development.\n Meanwhile, they began to worry about their environment.\n They feared raw effluent would begin to make its way into Lake\n\nOsoyoos, a gem of a lake - warm, beautiful, filled with fish. \n\n  Town administrator Lockie Miles chuckles philosophically over\n\nwhat Osoyoos used to do, vainly, to attract industry. \n " Like many other B.C. communities, for instance, we got a\n\ngrant in 1981 under the B.C.

{'text': 'At a UN conference in Turkey, Ottawa\'s strident homo\n\n<l> feminist agenda provokes an angry counter-attack from the Third World\n\n  \n\n  When Canada\'s delegates to the Second United Nations Conference on\n\nHuman Settlements arrived at their quarters in the posh Istanbul Hyatt three\n\nweeks ago, they knew what their mission was: to manipulate yet another UN\n\nconference into endorsing far-left social policies that could never be sold\n\nopenly to their own citizens.\n In particular, even though the Habitat II conference was\n\nostensibly about housing issues, the Canadians intended to ensure that\n\nfeminist goals such as contraception, abortion on demand and\n\nschool-based sex assistance clinics were enshrined in the conference\'s\n\nfinal document.\n "\n\ninclusive"  definition of family that sanctions homosexual\n\nunions. \n\n  Opposing Canada and its allies in the U.S. and European Union\n\ndelegations were dozens of developing countries which are becoming\n\nincreasingly enraged over the unrelenting Western campaign to impose de\n\n<l> generate policies on their impoverished and unsuspecting people.\n Also opposed was the Vatican delegation and a small but dedicated\n\ncollection of pro-family and pro-life non-governmental organizations ( NGOs).\n\n\n\n  Still, the Canadians had every reason to feel confident.\n After all, they had led the successful charge to feminize the\n\nfinal conference documents at the 1994 International Conference on Population\n\nand Development in Cairo and last year\'s Fourth UN Conference on Women\n\nin Beijing.\n Furthermore, the unprecedented input being granted in Istanbul\n\nto feminist NGOs - many of which are directly funded by Western governments -\n\ngave Canada\'s veteran negotiators yet another reason to anticipate easy\n\nvictory. \n\n  But things didn\'t go as planned.\n While Habitat II\'s final document predictably contained a host\n\nof references to  " environmental sustainability"  and\n\nother liberal buzz-words, Third World resistance forced the deletion of all\n\nsignificant references to  " re-productive health"  (\n\nabortion) and  " sexual health"  ( mandatory sex instruction).\n\n\n\n  Even more embarrassing, a bid by developing countries to\n\nstress the crucial social role of the natural mother-and-father family\n\nforced Canadian delegates to reveal their own anti-family program.\n This, in turn, earned Canada an unprecedented public condemnation\n\nfrom the Vatican\'s chief spokesman.\n And even a key U.S. delegate felt compelled to complain that Canada\'s\n\nmilitancy was preventing proper international recognition of parental\n\nresponsibility. \n\n  These contentious Canadian manoeuvres abroad are not merely\n\nintended to force Western liberalism on  " backward" \n\nThird Worlders.\n The manipulation of the UN process, family advocates warn, is a key\n\ncomponent of the Chretien government\'s strategy to impose social radicalism\n\nback at home. \n\n  The Canadian delegation wasted little time before showing its\n\nhand in Istanbul.\n After conference-opening formalities were dispensed with on\n\nMonday, June 3, delegates got down to deliberations.\n\n\nument had been prepared at a series of pre-conference meetings known as\n\nPrepComs.\n Phrases that delegates could not agree on at the final PrepCom had\n\nbeen placed in brackets.\n Those phrases would now either be deleted or their brackets removed.\n\n\n\n  Shortly after deliberations began in Committee One, which\n\nwas charged with resolving most of the contentious passages, nation\n\nafter nation spoke in favour of removing the brackets around a phrase\n\nacknowledging parental responsibilities for children.\n But just when it appeared this seemingly innocuous affirmation would\n\nbe approved, Canada and the European Union objected.\n U.S. support for the phrase thereupon wavered, forcing the paragraph\n\nin question to be set aside.  \n\n  " parental responsibility"\n\n centred around the phrase\'s alleged failure to conform with the 1989\n\nUN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n That document - which the Alberta government ( alone in Canada) has\n\nrefused to ratify - sets out a number of children\'s  " rights"\n\n which exist independently of parents. \n\n  But when word of the American refusal to endorse parental\n\nresponsibility seeped back to the U.S., outrage was immediate.\n Why, Congressional conservatives demanded, was their country\n\ndenigrating parents? \n\n  By Friday, June 7, that anger had borne fruit.\n U.S. delegate Mike Stegman told a lobbyist that the American\n\ndelegation now wanted to endorse parental responsibility, but was being\n\nstymied by Canada.\n Not until the following week, with Canadian delegates this time\n\nmaintaining a studious silence, was the phrase finally able to make its way\n\ninto the document. \n\n  That muteness by no means signalled a Canadian change of heart,\n\nhowever.\n Another paragraph contained a bracketed reference stressing\n\nthe vital role of the family in human settlements.\n Throughout days of heated debate, Canada consistently opposed\n\nliberating the phrase from its brackets.\n "\n\ninclusive"  language, Canada insisted, to acknowledge  " a\n\nvariety of forms"  of families.  \n\n  " families"\n\n it wished to recognize, delegations from predominantly Catholic and\n\nMuslim countries concluded that one objective was to obtain tacit\n\nrecognition of homosexual partnerships.\n They also suspected Canada was deliberately undermining\n\nrecognition of the foundational role of the two-parent heterosexual marriage.\n\n\n\n  On Thursday, June 13, the deadlocked paragraph was referred to a\n\nclosed-door  " working group"  convened to resolve such\n\nimpasses.\n According to three delegates who participated in the private\n\nnegotiations, the Canadian delegate complained that the family was\n\nalready over-represented.\n would be referred to three times in the\n\nfinal document, the Canadian huffed, whereas other important terms like\n\n " gender"  enjoyed only a single mention.\n phrase had to be\n\ndeleted, even though none of the other 168 countries represented in\n\nIstanbul had objected. \n\n  This Canadian insistence on disparaging the traditional family\n\nmystified developing-world representatives.\n Marthe Lorena de Casco, a Honduran journalist who served on the\n\nVatican delegation, recounted a conversation she had with a female\n\nCanadian delegate.\n " Your ancestors made Canada what it is with beautiful\n\nfamilies that overcame the harsh conditions they faced,"  Mrs.\n\nde Casco told the woman.   " Without the family, you would not\n\nhave what you have today. Why do you want developing countries not to\n\nhave good families?"  \n\n\n  Dr. Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the chief spokesman for Pope John Paul\n\nII and the Vatican delegation\'s press liaison in Istanbul, castigated\n\nthe Canadian stance at his June 14 conference-closing press conference.\n By its consistent opposition to the use of the word family, and its\n\nattempt to compare the number of times  " family"  and\n\n " gender"  occurred in the document, Canada was in effect ar\n\n<l> guing that  " the family is a concept prejudicial to women,"\n\n Dr. Navarro-Valls charged. \n\n  Not only was this anti-family position a contravention of the\n\nUN\'s 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Dr. Navarro-Valls added, it\n\nwas a prime example of how Western liberals had poisoned the entire Is <l>\n\ntanbul gathering.   " It is a pity these kinds of discussions,\n\nwhich have nothing to do with Habitat, will compromise the unanimity of the\n\nfinal document."   \n\n  By then, in fact, the revolt of the developing world against the\n\nWest\'s homo-feminist agenda had tied up debate for days.\n In the conference\'s first week, the U.S. - firmly backed by Canada -\n\nhad introduced language recognizing  " reproductive health"\n\n and  " sexual health"  services into four ad <l>\n\nditional sites in the Habitat II document. \n\n  Since Western delegates had deliberately failed to specify what\n\nthe language really referred to, conservative NGOs quickly tipped the\n\ndeveloping world as to what was at stake.\n " reproductive\n\nhealth"  means providing individuals with access to  "\n\nmeans of fertility regulation of their choice." \n "\n\ninterrupting unwanted pregnancies,"  a euphemism for abortion.\n services, meanwhile, was code\n\nfor school-based sex instruction. \n\n  The Western goal was to extract a UN endorsement that could be\n\nused to club national and local governments to accept contraception,\n\nabortion, and sex-ed services.\n But the feminist scenario did not play out as scripted.\n Once the real meaning of the phrases was explained, predominantly\n\nCatholic and Muslim nations dug in their heels.\n Such programs are anathema to their fundamental beliefs, they\n\nprotested.\n Furthermore, Istanbul was supposed to be about human\n\nsettlements, they noted, not advancing the pro-abortion and anti-family\n\nagendas that dominated Cairo and Beijing. \n\n  Faced with such Third World obstinacy, the Western negotiating\n\njuggernaut mobilized all of its resources.\n a collection of feminist NGOs\n\nled by former U.S. congressman Bella Abzug\'s Women\'s Economic and Development\n\nOrganization ( WEDO), had already been granted unprecedented\n\nfreedom to lobby delegates.\n The feminist NGOs redoubled those efforts while simultaneously making\n\na naked bid to hijack the official NGO document by assuring themselves a\n\npreponderance on the roster of of 20 NGO spokesmen slated to address\n\nCommittee Two delegates dealing with Habitat II\'s implementation. \n\n  Both feminist powerplays were thwarted.\n Toronto lawyer Gwen Landolt, who chaired the pro-family and pro-life\n\nCaucus for Stable Communities, had astutely secured a slot on the NGO\'s\n\nInternational Facilitating Group after arriving in Istanbul.\n When the feminist NGOs tried to import their agenda into the NGO\n\ndocument on June 9, Mrs. Landolt calmly deleted every reference to\n\n " re-productive health"  and  " sexual orientation."\n\n \n\n  And when the feminist NGOs appeared before Committee Two to\n\ndeliver their pitch the next day, another unpleasant surprise lay in store\n\nfor them.\n After Ms. Abzug and three Women\'s Caucus partisans delivered the\n\nopening NGO addresses, the Vatican successfully petitioned for opposing\n\nNGO viewpoints be heard.\n Delegates thereupon listened raptly as a battery of conservative NGOs\n\ndetailed how the entire NGO process had been improperly kidnapped by the\n\nfeminist caucus with the blessing of UN officials and Western delegates.\n\n \n\n  Mrs. Landolt took the opportunity to point out that many of the\n\nsupposedly  " grass-roots"  feminist NGOs were really unrepre\n\n<l> sentative  " phantom"  agencies sustained by government\n\nfunding.\n\n\nment\'s &dollar;40,000 grant to WEDO. \n\n  Since the previous Thursday, the homo-feminist camp had been\n\nwaging a campaign of  " exhaust and conquer." \n\n\nments to the draft document in an obvious ploy to tire Third World delegates\n\ninto submission.\n Committee One chairman Shafqat Kakakhel declined to condemn openly\n\nthe Canadian manoeuvre as a stalling tactic, but conceded that it was\n\n " undeniable"  that  " it burdens other\n\ndelegations with other material."  \n\n  Mercedes Wilson, chief Guatemalan delegate, was less\n\ndiplomatic.\n she commented.\n\n  " They are so arrogant. It would be comical if it wasn\'t so\n\ndestructive."   \n\n  Once the Western nations had created an appropriately massive\n\nbacklog of unresolved paragraphs, they referred as much of the con <l>\n\ntentious language as possible to the smaller closed-door working groups.\n Canada, the U.S. and the EU, who generally controlled the chairmen of\n\nthese subgroups, tried to obscure the location of the working groups,\n\nand restrict provision of translation services.\n When this procedural manipulation failed, threats began to suspend\n\ncrucial aid projectsor to increase interest rates on development loans. \n\n\n\n  Mrs. Landolt spoke with a Tanzanian delegate who confessed\n\nsadly that she was unable to speak out against Western initiatives she\n\nopposed.\n\n\nthe delegate said. \n\n  Abdulaziz Al Khedeiri, one of Saudi Arabia\'s chief\n\ndelegates, said that the Western bloc also used a threat to relocate the\n\noffices of the UN Commission on Human Settlements from Nairobi as a\n\nlever against African delegates.\n Mr. Khedeiri added that further pressure was exerted through hints\n\nthat the developed  willingness to ratify the conference\n\ngoal of devoting 0.7% of gross national product to supporting human\n\nsettlements was contingent upon adopting the West\'s social platform.\n\n\n\n  British Secretary of State for the Environment John Gummer,\n\nthe head of the British delegation, was the sole Western leader to condemn\n\nthis bullying publicly.\n " the\n\nimperialistic view of poor people who live a long way away."  \n\n  But unlike in Beijing and Cairo, the West\'s bullying and\n\nobfuscation proved largely unavailing.\n Led by Saudi Arabia, which was immune to western economic\n\nthreats, developing nations forced the deletion of one  "\n\nre-productive health"  reference after another.\n At 7 a.m. on Friday, after developing-world representatives had\n\nrebuffed a last-ditch Western ploy to sneak its abortion and\n\nsex-education agenda past exhausted delegates under the guise of a  "\n\nhealth"  definition lifted from the Beijing document, U.S. delegate\n\nMelinda Kimble stalked from the Committee One meeting room shaking with rage.\n\n\n\n  " reproductive health"\n\n reference had survived, as did language endorsing  "\n\nfamily planning"  .\n But at Saudi insistence, the unimpeded right of countries to\n\ninterpret all aspects of the Habitat document in the context of their\n\nindividual cultural, religious and ethical values was explicitly\n\nconfirmed. \n\n  As the conference wound down, criticism of the efforts of Canada\n\nand other Western nations was widespread.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b28892e1-b2d5-47aa-bcae-89e4e82ef680', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.823506+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9700978398323059, 'non_english_score': 0.029902160167694092}

\n\n  Yet to North Americans, there\'s no mistaking Montreal for any\n\nother city on the continent: raffish, risqué, carefree, a wide-open\n\ntown, nightclubs packed till all hours.\n Certifiably French, foreign.\n An exotic place, romantic, sensual, its past filled with adventure\n\nand colorful characters. \n\n  Montreal is a city of diversity and complexity, with a non-French\n\nethnic population that is a mixture of English and a hundred other\n\nminorities.\n Greeks, Italians, Portuguese, and Jews each have a community\n\n100,000-strong.\n There are Asians and Haitians too.\n Montreal is also cosmopolitan, fashionable, intellectual, a political\n\nhotbed, a university town, bohemian, a mecca for artists and nonconformists\n\nwho gather here to slip the stifling bonds of provincialism.\n And it is a cultured city that supports fine-arts museums, two\n\nsymphonies, ballet companies, an opera company, and French and English\n\ntheater.\n Not to mention the Festivale de Thé&acircumflex;tre des\n\nAmériques biennial, which takes over the city every odd year and has\n\nestablished an international reputation for presenting superior avant-garde\n\nand over-the-edge theater. \n\n  As in France, dining out in Montreal tends to be a ritual: The\n\nbest meals are evening-long affairs with a late start, uncounted courses,\n\nunrestrained conversation, uninhibited conviviality.\n The city\'s café society, perhaps the largest on the\n\ncontinent, thrives on Bishop, Crescent, Laurier, St-Denis, St-Laurent ( the\n\nMain), St-Paul, and half a dozen other lively thoroughfares.\n\n\n - more than 400 at last count - may be the quintessential Montreal\n\nsocial forum.\n Striped awnings are unrolled; bright umbrellas bloom above sidewalk\n\ntables.\n , a carafe of\n\nwine, a mug of beer, and spirited companions combine with a comfortable\n\nsetting for watching the world go by and savoring the precious days and\n\nevenings of the few warm months.\n\n\n  This vivacious city is on a roll.\n les autres\n\n  once again predominates, except for the die-hard factions\n\non either side.\n The Parti Québecois of the late René Lévesque\n\nwas a painful but necessary instrument for asserting the primacy of French\n\nlanguage and culture in the province of its North American birth.\n The last decade has seen the ascendancy of a well-educated, bilingual\n\nQuébecois business class that has displaced priests, politicians,\n\nlawyers, and bureaucrats as the province\'s elite. \n\n  This new generation of Québecois has shattered long-time\n\nAnglophone domination of the province, even elbowing into  \n\nle haute monde   .\n soirée\n\n at the Ritz ( what could be more Anglo?) reads like a  Who\'s Who\n\n of Francophone high society, with a sprinkling of WASPs for old time\'s\n\nsake.\n\n\ndently   ma&icircumflex;tres chez nous   . \n\n  For the most part, the province and the city have turned from\n\ncultural affairs to economic ones.\n\n\nsigns that sprouted like mushrooms on front lawns in predominantly\n\nEnglish-speaking neighborhoods during the threatening days of separatism have\n\nbeen replaced with the signs of a vigorous economy flexing its muscles after\n\na decade of political confinement - soaring property values, gentrification\n\nof run-down neighborhoods, new Metro ( subway) lines, new museums, a\n\ndowntown construction boom.\n\n\n  The Montreal street grid is actually oriented on a\n\nnortheast-southwest axis, but no one in the city follows that.\n The convention is that rue Sherbrooke runs east-west, and boulevard\n\nSt-Laurent ( The Main) runs north-south.\n So, for example, Université de McGill is west of St-Laurent,\n\nand Vieux-Montréal and the river are at the southern end of town. \n\n\n  From Quai Victoria, the patinated spires and gleaming domes in\n\nVieux-Montréal present an essentially antique picture; the eye\n\nwillingly overlooks the dissonant details of modernity.\n At the district\'s eastern extremity a copper statue of the Virgin\n\nMary stands behind the tiny  Notre-Dame-de-Bonsecours chapel  .\n chapel, its roofline is cluttered\n\nwith steeple and tower.\n This is the 1773 Our Lady of the Harbour, celebrated in the song\n\n " Suzanne"  by Montrealer Leonard Cohen.\n Beside the church shines the silver dome of Bonsecours Market,\n\nCanada\'s Parliament from 1849 to 1852 and, for decades following, Montreal\'s\n\nprincipal market ( it now houses municipal offices).\n classical\n\nfa&ccedille;ade rises the Second Empire roof of City Hall, where, on a\n\nthird-floor balcony in 1967, Charles de Gaulle fanned the flames of\n\nseparatism with his disruptive exhortation,  "   Vive le\n\nQuébec libre   ! " \n Farther west, sunlight gleams off the white cupola of the former\n\nPalais de Justice.\n Still farther west, twin Gothic spires nicknamed Temperance and\n\nPerseverance soar above the nave of Notre-Dame Basilica, cynosure of the\n\nRoman-Catholic faithful since 1829. \n\n  Behind these archaisms, the more familiar North American\n\ncityscape to the north and northwest reaffirms itself in concrete apartment\n\nbuildings and office high-rises, undistinguished except for the anodized\n\nelegance of the Bourse de Montréal ( Stock Exchange Tower) and the\n\ncruciform mass of Place Ville-Marie.\n Then the eye looks deeper into the scene and alights on another of\n\nMontreal\'s unique views: Behind the downtown spires, Mont Royal lifts a\n\nleafy crown bejeweled with a metal cross, the thematic antecedent of Place\n\nVille-Marie. \n\n  But this view is fast-changing: Both the expanded Palais des\n\nCongr&egrave;s de Montréal convention center and the World Trade\n\nCentre office-retail and hotel complex will open in 1991.\n The latter will occupy several city blocks in Vieux-Montréal,\n\nincluding rue St-Jacques, formerly the  " Wall Street"  of\n\nCanada. \n By then, the area will be home to two other megascale commercial\n\nprojects: A &dollar;250-million, 51-story office tower project with a winter\n\ngarden and year-round outdoor skating rink  &agrave; la  New\n\nYork\'s Rockefeller Center will be nestled between Place Bonaventure and Place\n\ndu Canada.\n Rivalling it will be the 45-story IBM-Marathon building, facing the\n\nSheraton Centre, that will feature an adjoining eight-story winter garden.\n\n\n\n  The waterfront area has also undergone critical development\n\nin the past six years, critical because the harborside and  rue\n\nde la  Commune form the southern boundary of Vieux-Montréal -\n\ncradle of the city, its greatest tourist attraction, and, second only to\n\nQuebec City\'s Place Royale, a repository of the nation\'s past.\n The 95-acre historic district extends west to rue McGill, east to\n\n rue  Berri, and north to  rue  St-Antoine -\n\nroughly corresponding to the perimeter of the old walls of the city.\n\n\n\n  More changes are in store, planned to coincide with the city\'s\n\n350th-anniversary celebration in 1992.\n The Montreal Archeology and History Centre, opening near Place\n\nRoyale at the precise site of the first European settlement in Montreal, is\n\npart of a scheme that will restore Montreal\'s waterfront to its former\n\nglory. \n\n  Most of the architecture here is Victorian, although there remain\n\nenough crooked alleys and cockeyed houses from earlier eras to proclaim the\n\ndistrict\'s 350 years of habitation.\n The old quarter is enclosed and intimate, the scale human.\n Around every corner a new scene presents itself - a confusion of\n\nancient masonry and fire escapes, a carriageway leading to an enclosed\n\ncourtyard, a curving row of century-old gray-stone buildings ( no two of them\n\nalike), a blue sliver of the St. Lawrence glimpsed between dwellings. \n\n  Since the area\'s revival in the 1960s, scores of field-stone\n\ndwellings and warehouses along the narrow streets have been scrubbed down and\n\nrenovated; they are now occupied by shops, restaurants, clubs, businesses,\n\nstudios, museums, and private homes.\n has become a\n\nvibrant place in which to live, work, eat, and play. \n\n  There\'s little danger that Vieux-Montréal will turn into a\n\ntouristy museum piece like New York City\'s South Street Seaport or Boston\'s\n\nFaneuil Hall-Quincy Market.\n Even when it was down at the heels, this was still a working\n\nneighborhood, with banks along rue St-Jacques, law offices and\n\ncourthouses on rue Notre-Dame, and, along lesser thoroughfares, import-export\n\ncompanies, shipping firms, photography studios, book publishers, printers,\n\nnightclubs, restaurants, even a costume emporium.  \n\n  After its revival, Vieux-Montréal was still cut off from\n\nthe river - its lifeline since the 17th century - by fenced dockyards,\n\nrailroad tracks, and a phalanx of five grain elevators that seemed to crush\n\nthe old city with their mass.\n Then, in the late 1970s, the bulk of the dockyard operations shifted\n\nseveral miles east.\n Down came the fences and the elevators.\n What remained were the railroad tracks, several hangars, and\n\nfour empty piers as broad as aircraft-carrier decks: Alexandra, King Edward,\n\nJacques-Cartier, and Victoria.\n to the city, and\n\na great debate began: What to do with this wonderful new resource? \n\n  Fortunately, the city spurned the usual pressure to construct a\n\nmegaproject and instead chose a modest, step-by-step plan.\n Two phases have thus far produced grassy, landscaped expanses, ponds,\n\nand flower-filled planters on both sides of the tracks; grade crossings for\n\npedestrians; cycling paths; and renovation of the 1922 Sailor\'s Memorial\n\nTower at the tip of Victoria Pier. \n\n  People drift down from Place Jacques-Cartier, the heart of\n\nVieux-Montréal, to stroll around the piers or rent bicycles and\n\nquadricycles.\n Clowns, jugglers, musicians, balloon sculptors, and food vendors add\n\nto the festive air as a once moribund part of town comes alive with activity.\n Concerts take place on summer nights beneath a big-top tent on Quai\n\nJacques-Cartier; later in the evening, the musical torch is passed to\n\nQuébecois   chanteurs   performing on a\n\nbeer-garden boat docked at the end of the pier. \n\n  A flea market occupies part of former Hangar No. 8, while the\n\nhangar\'s upper level is devoted to one of the Vieux-Port\'s two major annual\n\nsummer exhibitions,  Images du Futur  .\n This international showcase highlights the latest technological\n\nadvances in the visual arts: laser and video displays, computer graphics,\n\nholography, sound-and-light-wave sculptures, computer-synthesized\n\nsound-scapes, and multi-sensory, multi-media installations.\n Each year the exhibition presents a different country\'s artists,\n\ncultural organizations, and corporations.\n Next door in Hangar No. 9 is Expotec, an equally popular annual\n\nexhibition presenting interactive displays about the latest scientific\n\nresearch and technological developments of interest to the general\n\npublic.\n Attracting some 300,000 people, the 1990 exhibition was about sports\n\nof every kind.\n Also here is the 7-story-high, 70-foot-wide IMAX Super Cinema screen,\n\nwhich presents films year-round. \n\n  Those who would like to see Canada at work can tour the Great\n\nLakes freighter  Maplecliffe Hall  , which carries grain from\n\nThunder Bay to a deep-sea transfer terminal at Baie-Comeau on the north shore\n\nof the Gulf of St. Lawrence; from late June to early September, business\n\nis slow, so the owners dock the  Maplecliffe  at the Vieux-Port and\n\nwelcome visitors on board. \n\n  , a cobbled\n\nrectangle sloping down from the ornate City Hall to  rue de la\n\n Commune, was the city\'s busiest open-air market ( the only reminders\n\nof this function are flower stands on a narrow median).\n Today the plaza justifiably remains the focal point of\n\nVieux-Montréal.\n Place Jacques-Cartier can be magical, especially on a warm summer\n\nnight, with the splashing Vauquelin fountain, the shadowy columns on the City\n\nHall\'s floodlit fa&ccedille;ade, the sidewalk vendors and street musicians,\n\nthe   cal&egrave;ches   drawn by stoic nags snuf <l>\n\nfling battered oat bags.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'ad6156df-d4b3-41da-acb4-97837b6e4bf7', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.824921+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9179957509040833, 'non_english_score': 0.08200424909591675}
{'text': 'METRAC ( The Metro Action Committee on Public Violence\n\nAgainst Women and Children) was established in 1984 by the council of\n\nMetropolitan Toronto.\n It succeeds a task force initiated by the council in 1982 to address\n\nthe concerns of women in Toronto after a series of rape-murders in the city.\n\n\n\n  The task force involved 80 volunteer members from a wide range of\n\nbackgrounds: doctors, lawyers, politicians, police, social workers, urban\n\nplanners, workers from rape crisis centres, and other women\'s organiza <l>\n\ntions.\n They established a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach which\n\nMETRAC has carried forward in its work on violence prevention. \n\n  The recommendations of the task force were both extensive and\n\nfar-sighted.\n METRAC\'s function, therefore, is to act as a catalyst for the\n\nimplementation of these recommendations addressing criminal justice,\n\npolicing, support services, public education and urban planning. \n\n  Since its inception, METRAC has been able to rely on the support\n\nof municipal politicians for its advocacy work.\n In fact, METRAC carries out extensive consulting work with all three\n\nlevels of government, as well as with community groups and the media to\n\ndevelop pioneering initiatives, programs, policies and practices to enhance\n\nthe safety of women and children in Metro Toronto. \n\n\n  Women\'s safety is affected by a multitude of factors.\n These include: public understanding of sexual assault; urban\n\ndesign; treatment of offenders by the criminal justice system; the\n\nimpact of pornography; and standards of professional conduct.\n In Canada, the sexual victimization of women and children is\n\npervasive; often it is only nominally discouraged.\n It is crucial that we admit this and acknowledge that women\'s fears\n\nare based in reality.\n As we women go about our daily lives in the city, we know when we\n\nfeel unsafe, and why.\n METRAC stresses the importance of consulting with women as a\n\nprimary step in any project undertaken to make the city a safer place. \n\n  As an organization, METRAC is informed by women\'s\n\nexperience, guided by a carefully developed analysis, committed to the\n\neradication of violence and energized by recognition of the need for change.\n\n\n\n  Working in the areas of prevention and education, METRAC has\n\nrecommended and launched many initiatives.\n With the long-term goal of 24-hour safe access to the city, METRAC\n\nhas placed women\'s safety and security issues firmly on the public agenda.\n\n\n\n\n  Much of the work done by METRAC has an important crime-prevention\n\ncomponent.\n Since assault by a stranger is, to some extent, a crime of\n\nopportunity, various physical/geographical features may enhance or\n\ndetract from the use of a particular site for assault.\n A number of METRAC\'s pilot projects, therefore, concentrate on urban\n\ndesign.\n\n\n\n  This was a groundbreaking project designed to document\n\nwomen\'s concerns about urban planning and design.\n With support from Women Plan Toronto and the Faculty of Environmental\n\nStudies, York University, METRAC interviewed many women ( including\n\nsingle mothers, older, immigrant and disabled women).\n Women in\n\nSafe Environments  (  " the WISE report"  )  .\n\n\n  METRAC successfully encouraged the establishment of a City of\n\nToronto committee to review the standards of illumination and security\n\nin underground garages in Toronto.\n Over two years, the committee\'s work has resulted in an amended\n\nby-law and higher illumination levels, improved signage, the whitewashing of\n\nall walls and the installation of new door-locking devices. \n\n\n\n\n  Together with the Toronto Transit Commission ( TTC) and the\n\nMetro Toronto Police Force, METRAC initiated a safety audit of the 65\n\nstations in the subway system.\n This involved assessment of the safety, accessibility and\n\ndistance from help of parts of the station buildings and grounds and was\n\naimed at sexual assault prevention.\n The 63 recommendations of the report have been adopted by the\n\nTTC, and audits of surface routes in the transit system have begun. \n\n\n  METRAC conducted safety audits of Toronto\'s largest park and made\n\nextensive recommendations designed to improve its safety for the women and\n\nchildren who use it. \n Safety Audit Kit\n\n \n\n  Recognizing that women limit their use of public and semipublic\n\nspaces when they feel unsafe, METRAC has developed a safety audit kit which\n\nwomen can use to analyse and document their safety concerns in the city, in\n\ntheir home neighbourhood or in their workplace. \n\n\n  Working with the Metro Toronto Police Force, METRAC has developed\n\ntraining programmes for sexual assault investigators and other police\n\npersonnel to increase police sensitivity to sexual assault survivors.\n The improved quality of investigations and consequent increase\n\nin reporting rate for sexual assault cases will have significant results\n\nfor crime prevention. \n\n\n \n\n  With impetus and information from METRAC, City of Toronto\n\npoliticians produced an urban safety report,  Safe City: Municipal\n\nStrategies to Prevent Violence Against Women and Children  .\n With the aid of the Safe City Committee, recommendations from\n\nthe report are currently being implemented  .\n\n\n  METRAC is currently preparing a discussion paper on women\'s\n\nsafety and urban standards in order to facilitate the development of\n\ncriteria for guidelines and standards for all buildings in the city:\n\nconstruction and renovation projects; shopping centres and housing\n\nprojects; parks; and all other public and semipublic spaces. \n\n\n  With schoolboards and educators, METRAC is working on both\n\ncurriculum development and staff training in the area of violence prevention,\n\ntogether with the institution of supportive policies. \n\n\n  METRAC initiated a series of community-based conferences\n\ncalled  Stopping Rape  to raise awareness and prompt action at a\n\ncommunity level.\n METRAC has also supported greater access to Wen-Do self-defence\n\nprogrammes in schools, recreation centres and community buildings, noting\n\nespecially that these need to be accessible for disabled women. \n\n\n  It is METRAC\'s experience that when city officials and urban\n\nplanners and designers think about safety, their thoughts turn to fire and\n\ntraffic regulations.\n There is a tendency to overlook the necessity to create an\n\nenvironment which can be safely used and which, by deliberate planning and as\n\n<l> sessment, reduces the likelihood of attack and assault. \n\n  Those who are in any way vulnerable - children, women, disabled\n\nor elderly people - still have the right to safe access to the city they live\n\nin.\n The explicit addressing of women\'s concerns about safety and sexual\n\nassault prevention results in urban design which enhances everyone\'s safety.\n\n  \n\n  METRAC ( The Metro Action Committee on Public Violence\n\nAgainst Women and Children) is located at 158 Spadina Road, Toronto M5R 2T8.\n\n<l> Telephone: ( 416)-392-3135.

Donald, and\n\nPat Freeman Marshall.  \n\n\n  Many women never go out alone after dark.\n Many try to arrange for friends to meet them at the bus stop, or\n\nspend scarce dollars on taking a cab.\n Many women who work shifts in low-paying jobs cannot make either of\n\nthese arrangements.\n When we do go out, we avoid places that we judge to be unsafe.\n Women simply do not have the freedom of movement in the city that\n\nmost men enjoy without question: our use of public space is deeply\n\naffected by the pervasive threat of sexual assault. \n\n  Between a third and half of these sexual assaults take place in\n\nurban public space.\n Unfortunately, the image of sexual assault by a stranger in a public\n\nplace has all too often been that of a deranged man lurking in the bushes.\n Similarly, the assault has often been blamed on the woman who is\n\nits victim: she was in the wrong place, at the wrong time, in the wrong\n\nclothes, acting in the wrong ways.\n Endless work of feminist organizations over the decades has\n\nbegun to debunk this mythology, although sadly there is still a lot of work\n\nto do. \n\n  Changing the environment to fit our needs can be one step in the\n\nfight against violence against women.\n When itcomes to women\'s safety, women have the knowledge and\n\nexpertise that the  " professionals"  lack.\n It does not require a degree in planning or design to\n\nrecognise what makes a place unsafe and threatening.\n It requires relevant experience, and women have a lifetime\'s worth of\n\nthat.  \n\n\n\n\n &bullet; One in four women in Canada can expect to be\n\nsexually assaulted at some point in their lives, one half of these women\n\nbefore the age of 17. \n &bullet; One million women in Canada are abused by their hus\n\n<l> bands or live-in lovers each year. \n &bullet; 15% of all homicides are murders of women by their\n\nhusbands, but only 6% of all homicides are murders of men by their wives.\n\n\n\n\none other than their husbands or ex-husbands each year.   \n\n\n  Women live in realistic fear of this high risk of violence.\n 56% of urban Canadian women feel unsafe walking alone in their own\n\nneighbourhoods after dark, while only 18% of men said they feel unsafe in the\n\nsame circumstances.\n Women\'s fear is escalated not only by their high risk of violence,\n\nbut because the nature of women\'s victimization gives women the strong\n\nmessage that there is no safe place for them and no one they can trust. \n\n\n  Women\'s fears are further escalated by daily experiences,\n\nresponsibilities and perceptions which are tied to negative social\n\nvalues surrounding women\'s bodies and sexuality, to women\'s unequal economic\n\nand social status in our society and to their primary responsibility for the\n\ncare of children.\n Women\'s common experiences with sexual harassment as well as\n\ndemeaning portrayals of women and their sexuality in the media and in\n\nbillboard advertising, contribute to women\'s feelings of being at risk  .\n Violence Has More Serious Consequences for Women\n\n \n\n  Women who are victims of violence suffer higher risks of serious\n\ninjuries and trauma than men who are victims of violence.\n Women who are victims of violence are more likely to suffer economic\n\nhardship than men who are victims of violence.\n Women who are abused by their husbands may be forced to flee their\n\nhomes, possessions and economic security to escape the violence.\n Because women are more likely to be poor than are men, they are also\n\nless able to afford needed repairs, medical procedures and/or\n\ncounselling necessitated by their victimization. \n\n  When women who are victims of violence seek help from legal,\n\nhealth and social services, they frequently find the services\n\ninsensitive to their particular form of victimization or their experiences as\n\nwomen.\n " double victimization"\n\n at the hands of helping agencies.\n Immigrant, visible minority and disabled women also report that avail\n\n<l> able services are often unknown to them and, even where they are known,\n\nare inaccessible because of language barriers, physical barriers,\n\ndiscrimination and/or the lack of specialized services to meet their\n\nparticular needs. \n\n\n  Fear exaggerates the inequality between rich and poor because the\n\nrich can afford sophisticated security systems and protection, leaving\n\nthe poor even more vulnerable to crime, relatively speaking.\n Withdrawal leaves the streets open to criminal behaviour, and\n\ncontributes eventually to deteriorating business conditions.\n The quality of life of the entire community is eroded, city life\n\nbecomes devalued, degraded, and the collapse of the community eventually be\n\n<l> comes inevitable. \n\n\n  If the demise of our urban centres is to be reversed, women\'s\n\nfear and victimization must be reduced.\n Strong political will is needed to energize local,\n\nprovincial/territorial, national and international communities.\n\n\n\n  We must build strategies for change rooted in an acceptance of\n\nthe validity and appropriateness of women\'s fear.\n We must build change through the promotion of women\'s rights to\n\nsafety, dignity, respect, justice, empowerment and involvement in the\n\ncommunity.\n Municipal politicians are connected to the lives of their\n\nconstituents and are empowered to coordinate and mobilize their communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  &bullet;

{'text': 'A privileged minority is using private insurance to jump the\n\nhealth-care queue \n\n\n  Dr. M. is a noted urologist practising in a large Toronto hospital\n\nin a suite of offices he shares with several others.\n Yet these offices are as quiet as if they were in a private clinic.\n The chairs are soft.\n The attractive young assistants and secretaries dress well; with\n\npatients and doctors alike, they remain honey-voiced and discreet.\n Dr. M. and his colleagues specialize in prostate patients, some of\n\nthem high-profile ones: the offices are full of bankers and lawyers and\n\nbig investors. \n\n  Unlike his colleagues, however, Dr. M. is a member of a\n\nspecialist-referral network, a group of doctors organized and hired by a\n\ncompany known as an independent medical-assessment service.\n These companies recruit doctors from big hospitals and small\n\nclinics: cardiologists, urologists, psychiatrists, back doctors, ophthal\n\n<l> mologists; specialists in livers and kidneys and glands, in impotence and\n\ngastrointestinal problems.\n\n\ncess to the service through the company insurance plan.\n The assessment service then sends the employee to one doctor or\n\nanother within the network.\n\n\n  " " Rapid medical attention" " means calling up\n\na doctor, usually on short notice, and asking if there\'s a time slot\n\navailable for, say, a checkup that afternoon.\n If a time isn\'t available with the first member doctor, the\n\nassessment service will place the client with another.\n But since the doctors are paid, by some estimates, nearly twice as\n\nmuch for some procedures as they would get from the public health-insurance\n\nplan, the first doctor called is almost always available.\n If an ordinary medicare patient is scheduled for that time slot,\n\nand his visit is not a medical emergency, Dr. M.\'s secretary will call with\n\nthe regretful news of the doctor\'s urgent staff meeting or nasty cold or sud\n\n<l> den personal family crisis.\n The visit will be postponed, and the matter will stay between the\n\ndoctor and his secretary, the one who keeps his appointment book. \n\n  Every so often, someone from Dr. M.\'s particular\n\nmedical-assessment company comes by to drop off some forms for him to fill\n\nout.\n When Dr. M. hired a new secretary recently, the company\'s\n\nrepresentative came by to tell her about the basic arrangement.\n says Fred Holmes, a\n\nhealth-benefits consultant with the firm Towers, Perrin, who is familiar\n\nwith assessment companies,  " is to book some time with a group of spe\n\n<l> cialists.\n They say, \'okay, we\'ll pay you these dollars, and we get bumping\n\nprivileges in your list.\'  " \n And their clients get to jump the queue.\n A health-insurance executive in Waterloo, Ontario, describes\n\nassessment companies as having  " developed a network of expert\n\nbastards that are resident in our [ health-care] system, that are prepared to\n\ntake private billings and do private physicals.\n\n Indeed they have.\n " crowing"\n\n about all the money he can make this way, they say he is especially\n\nproud of one thing - it\'s all completely legal. \n\n  Dr. M. is not alone in his desire to make more money.\n Caps and clawbacks on their fees have many doctors, particularly\n\nspecialists, on the warpath.\n In Ontario this summer, both obstetricians and orthopaedic surgeons\n\nthreatened service cuts if the governing Tories didn\'t revoke these\n\ncaps, and a coalition of specialists advised its members to stop\n\naccepting new patients after October 1. \n\n  Nor is Dr. M. alone in heeding the siren call of private medical\n\nservices.\n The Canadian Medical Association put private funding for health\n\ncare - in other words, two-tier medicine - back on the agenda of its annual\n\nconference.\n ( Its members had voted down the issue in 1994.)\n Dr. M., though, has found a simpler way into the world of private\n\nmedicine.\n In expansive moments, he\'s confided that he\'s found a loophole in the\n\nsystem, one that, as Fred Holmes puts it,  " is, or can be, mammoth."\n\n \n\n  The loophole is this: the Canada Health Act guarantees all\n\nCanadians universal and equal access to medically necessary services.\n But it also contains something called the " " Exclusion\n\nParagraph." " The Exclusion Paragraph has two main points.\n - compensation\n\npremiums, then its  job-related injuries and illnesses are\n\npaid for by  Compensation, and not by the provincial\n\nhealth-insurance plan.\n Two, if an employer, or a life-, disability-, or auto-insurance\n\ncompany requires you to have a medical checkup, that checkup is not con <l>\n\nsidered " medically necessary."\n , and,\n\nagain, provincial health plans won\'t cover it. \n\n  Clearly, the Exclusion Paragraph was designed to keep the system\n\nhonest:  Comp pays for work-related medical problems;\n\nthird parties - employers and insurers - pay for what they require; and the\n\npublic system pays for everything else that\'s medically necessary, for\n\neveryone.\n Ironically, the Exclusion Paragraph has also served to open a window\n\nof opportunity for doctors to make more money than they would in the public\n\nsystem, by doing private or " third-party" work.\n That\'s why specialist-referral networks and medical-assessment\n\nservices have sprung up and are growing quickly.\n OHIP, for instance, pays a doctor &dollar;51.40 for a "\n\nconsultation," &dollar;105.40 for a " consultation for respiratory disease."\n\n(\n Every provincial health plan has its own schedule of fees.)\n But if a service is provided on a private basis, the fee is whatever\n\nthe doctor and the third party, whether it\'s an insurer or an assessment\n\ncompany, agree to. \n\n  So doctors have an incentive to look for private work\n\nAssessment-service companies operate as middlemen, working between\n\nthe employer and the doctor, or between the employer\'s insurance company\n\nand the doctor. (\n Perhaps because of this, not all insurance companies look kindly on\n\nmedical-assessment services.\n Some prefer to build their own stable of doctors directly.)\n There are assessment companies, like Rapid-Med, that work only with\n\nlife-, auto-, and health-insurance companies, hiring doctors to do\n\npre-employment medicals and the checkups needed for long-term\n\ndisability-insurance claims.\n Others, like Medcan Health Management Inc., offer comprehensive\n\nin-house checkups for executives, disability-claims assessment for injured\n\nline workers, and a specialist-referral network that in some cases by <l>\n\npasses the insurance company altogether to form its own exclusive triangle:\n\nemployer, high-ranking executive employee, and specialist-network\n\nphysician. \n\n  The idea is to get patients diagnosed faster than provincial\n\nmedicare can manage.\n Of course, if these patients had stayed in the public health-care\n\nsystem, they would be waiting in line precisely because the checkups they\n\nneed aren\'t considered medically necessary.\n An irony of assessment companies is that they can get their\n\nclients a procedure that\'s not considered urgent faster than one that is.\n\n\n\n  The clients who take advantage of the kind of organized\n\nqueue-jumping assessment services offer can be divided into several\n\nmajor groups.\n There are the employers who are frustrated and want their sick\n\nor hurt employee back to work.\n They\'d also like to make sure the employee isn\'t just faking it.\n\n\nnosed as quickly as possible.\n And there are employers who provide access to specialist networks as\n\na perk to a select senior-management group. \n\n  What they get is preferred access to top specialists like Dr. M.,\n\nand checkups that are more leisurely and that can be more comprehensive than\n\nthose offered to regular medicare patients.\n There is also the benefit, for both patient and doctor, of networking\n\nover the stethoscope - of chumminess and social cachet. \n\n  Dr. Bob Francis has been president of Medcan since the\n\nmid-1970s.\n As Francis seems to be the godfather of specialist networks, I\n\nexpected a chat with the Prince of Darkness when I phoned him up.\n Instead, he sounded kindly and a little befuddled, more like Mr.\n\nMagoo than Dr. Doom.\n After outlining his company\'s specialist-referral network for\n\nme, Dr. Francis told me earnestly,  " I don\'t call that two-tiered med\n\n<l> icine.\n\n Francis, in other words, claims he\'s simply helping his clients down\n\na  different  avenue to certain medical services.\n When I asked him if that didn\'t amount to helping his clients nose in\n\nahead of public patients waiting to see the same doctors, he had clearly been\n\nwaiting for the question. \n " The way I answer that is, what\'s not recognized ... is\n\nthat he [ the doctor] doesn\'t bump OHIP patients.\n OHIP has already decreed that he can see only so many patients\n\nper month.\n And by he or she seeing one of our patients it actually frees up a\n\nspot for another OHIP patient.\n So, if anything, it has the reverse effect.\n You\'re also freeing up some dollars.\n The person who\'s coming through our system is actually helping to\n\nsubsidize the system."  \n\n  Dr. Philip Berger, a family practitioner in downtown Toronto\n\nwho has cultivated a reputation as a critic of the medical\n\nestablishment, snorts at the notion that private service speeds the public\n\nsystem along.\n " Other people will have a longer, not a shorter, wait,\n\nbecause the doctors aren\'t available, because the wealthy and the\n\nbeneficiaries of insurance plans keep pushing themselves in.\n If you\'re standing in line at a movie theatre and someone in a white\n\nfox coat hurries to the head of the line and goes inside and calls back over\n\ntheir shoulder, \'See, the line is shorter now,\' would you believe it?"\n\n  \n\n  " Yep.\n\n slipping people in.\n But, you know, a doctor has the total choice, in his office\n\npractice, to choose who he sees and who he doesn\'t see, and who he stays late\n\nfor, and who he slips in first thing in the morning."   \n\n  Those in the medical-assessment business simply do not\n\nconcede that this causes problems.\n Alexander Gourley, president of Health Resource Management Ltd., a\n\n " diagnostic and assessment facilitator"  that works in\n\nAlberta, defends his business in much the same way as Bob Francis, depict <l>\n\ning it as a nonthreatening departure from medicare.\n HRM, he stresses, covers only diagnostic assessments - which aren\'t\n\ncovered under Alberta Health - and not the treatments themselves, which\n\nare.\n " Any of the services we require are, by definition,\n\nuninsured,"  Gourley says.\n " When a patient requires a treatment service covered by\n\na provincial health plan, then they\'re treated as equally as anyone\n\nelse.\n They bill the Alberta health-insurance plan.\n And we don\'t influence their movement through the queue.\n What we\'re looking for is a return-to-work diagnostic\n\nassessment.\n Then we negotiate terms and conditions with doctors, as does\n\neveryone else."   \n\n  This raises a few questions, however.\n " expediting and facilitating specialist referral"\n\n to  " establish or confirm diagnosis and duration of\n\ndisability"  as Gourley describes his company\'s services, still\n\njust a nice way to say paying for faster medical attention?\n And once a patient has jumped ahead for a referral, isn\'t his\n\ntreatment inevitably speeded up as well, even if it is done in the\n\npublic system?\n As Philip Berger, in discussing the private sector\'s impact on\n\nthe public one, points out:  " A doctor can\'t sit there and say \'Well,\n\nthe only reason you\'re here is because your employer sent you, therefore\n\nI\'m not going to listen to your chest. \n I\'m not going to pay attention to the fact you\'re drenched in\n\nsweat and hot.\'\n You have an obligation to do something for them, if that is the\n\ncase."   \n\n  And can we really be sure that all these private patients are\n\nslipped in at the end of the day, or first thing in the morning, as\n\nassessment companies claim?\n If they\'re not, if a regular OHIP patient waiting to have a medically\n\nnecessary service performed has to wait longer because the doctor\'s in\n\nwith someone whose appointment is not medically necessary, common sense\n\nsays that this amounts to organized queue-jumping, and that it contravenes at\n\nleast the spirit, if not the letter, of the Canada Health Act. \n\n  And is there always a hard and fast distinction made between\n\ndiagnosis and treatment?\n Or might doctors, particularly specialists protected by the privacy\n\nof their offices, be persuaded to provide a medically necessary service\n\nfaster, and off-OHIP, as it were, if the price were right? \n\n  The very existence of this alternative, private avenue to\n\nmedical service, never mind its growth in recent years, opens the door to all\n\nkinds of abuses that are difficult to track.\n Comp specialist at the\n\nOntario Federation of Labour, says he knows of injured line workers who have\n\nbeen pressured into filing disability-insurance claims rather than\n\nfiling  Compensation claims, and so receiving a far smaller\n\nsettlement.\n Comp premiums rise\n\ndramatically the more claims it files, it\'s often cheaper in the long run for\n\nthe company to do this).\n Fred Holmes says he has heard of an assessment service trying to\n\nconvince companies that, so long as they are paying \n\nCompensation premiums for their line workers, then  all  their\n\nemployees are eligible to have their medical services handled \n\noutside  medicare.\n That provides justification, in other words, for having their\n\nexecutives treated by specialist-referral network on a private basis, even\n\nfor medically necessary services.\n " Then you\'re into a world of illegal acts, as I understand\n\nthe law,"  says Holmes. \n\n  Third-party-payer procedures also create at least the potential\n\nfor doctors to bill the public system for services performed, and paid\n\nfor, on a private basis.\n " We deal\n\nwith people who are first class, and whose integrity would never, never allow\n\nthem to be so compromised." \n But the fact remains that there\'s no way of knowing for sure, and\n\ncritics charge that, in Ontario at least, the government seems to be little\n\nconcerned with enforcing third-party-payer procedure laws.\n says Ontario Ministry of Health\n\nspokesman Paul Kilbertus,  " We\'re not working too quickly towards it.\n But it is something we\'re committed to doing.\n It\'s never been a grey zone.\n\n In Ontario, the health professions are self-regulating.\n he concedes,\n\n " there\'s no way we\'re going to know about it.\n what doctors are billing\n\n them  for."  \n\n  And as for Bob Francis\'s contention that private service can\n\nsave the public system money, the opposite is more likely to be the\n\ncase.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '9db2ecd5-137b-4fc6-9148-fb42724c6642', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.827573+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9741566777229309, 'non_english_score': 0.025843322277069092}
{'text': "As our population grows older, profound implications will arise\n\nfor Canadian society.\n Many important public issues are and will be emerging as a result.\n\n\n\n  This booklet is an attempt to profile Canada's seniors as they are\n\nand as they see themselves.\n It is not intended to provide a comprehensive description, but rather\n\nan overall perspective on the seniors population  .\n\n  As seniors themselves well know, there are many inaccurate\n\nperceptions and even stereotypes about aging in our society.\n We often view aging as a process that begins later in life, usually\n\naround age 65.\n Those who have passed that age, then, are often regarded as passive\n\nand dependent, rather than as active and independent members of society. \n\n  Such generalizations completely miss the fact that aging is a\n\nlifelong process which encompasses a whole series of changes from birth to\n\ndeath.\n There exists no sudden or artificial transition to old age.\n Even many of the changes usually associated with aging, such as\n\ngreying hair, begin long before seniors status is acquired at age 65. \n\n  The following presentation will challenge some of the commonly\n\nheld myths and misperceptions about seniors.\n The perspective here is drawn from statistical data, but behind the\n\nstatistics are the lives of almost three million Canadians who are an\n\nintegral and dynamic part of our society. \n\n\n \n\n  The aging of the baby boom generation, combined with a\n\ndramatic decline in the birth rate since the early 1960s, will mean further\n\ngrowth in the proportion of Canada's seniors population well into the next\n\ncentury.\n Falling mortality rates will also continue adding to the number of\n\nseniors.\n The proportion of seniors who are over 85 will continue to increase.\n But the ratio of women to men, which has grown rapidly since the\n\nearly 1960s, will decline.  \n\n  &bullet; In 1986, 2.7 million Canadians were over 65; that's 11\n\nper cent of our population, compared to 6 per cent in 1931. \n\n  &bullet; By the year 2031, the percentage of seniors could rise\n\nto 22 per cent of the population or 7.5 million Canadians.  \n\n  &bullet; The proportion of seniors in the provinces ranges from\n\n13 per cent in Prince Edward Island, Manitoba and Saskatchewan to 9 per cent\n\nin Newfoundland, 8 per cent in Alberta and 4 per cent in the Yukon\n\nTerritories.\n By the year 2000, provincial variations are expected to converge\n\ntoward the national average. \n\n  &bullet; Seniors in Canada constitute a smaller percentage of the\n\npopulation than do seniors in many other industrialized countries.\n In Sweden, seniors make up 17 per cent of the population, in the\n\nUnited Kingdom 15 per cent and in the United States 12 per cent. \n\n  &bullet; Among seniors, the percentage of those over 80 could\n\ngrow from 20 per cent in 1986 to 25 per cent in 2001. \n\n  &bullet; Life expectancy continues to increase.\n Life expectancy at birth for women is 80 years, up from 74 in the\n\nearly 1960s; for men it is 73 years, up from 68 in the early 1960s. \n\n  &bullet; At age 65, a woman can expect to live 19 more years and\n\na man 15 more years. \n\n  &bullet; There are 120 women for every 100 men in the 65-69 age\n\ngroup.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Seniors as a group are not homogeneous.\n The differences among them in health, marital status, housing, income\n\nand ethnicity are as great as they are among younger Canadians.\n The living situations of older women often differ considerably from\n\nmen of the same age.\n As Canadians live longer, this diversity will continue to grow.\n for seniors is\n\nbecoming increasingly arbitrary. \n\n  Seniors, like other Canadians, are of different generations, each\n\nwith their own history of social experiences.\n others'\n\n memories do not pre-date the Depression.\n In addition to a particular set of social experiences, seniors, as a\n\ngroup, differ from younger Canadians in several ways: \n\n  &bullet; Eleven per cent of Canadians over 65 speak neither\n\nEnglish nor French at home - nearly double the percentage of those under 50.\n\n\n\n  &bullet; Older Canadians are more likely to be of British origin\n\nthan are younger ones.\n Fifty-five per cent of those 80 and over are of British descent\n\ncompared to 39 per cent of those under 65. \n\n  &bullet; Older Canadians are less likely to be of French origin\n\nthan are younger ones.\n Twenty per cent of those 80 and over are of French descent, compared\n\nto 27 per cent of those under 65. \n\n  &bullet; Seniors make up 14 per cent of the population of\n\nvillages with 1000 to 2499 people - a higher concentration than in rural\n\nareas and large urban centres. \n\n  &bullet; Seventy-seven per cent of men 65 and over are married,\n\ncompared to 41 per cent of women of the same age. \n\n  &bullet; Thirty per cent of women in the 65-69 age group are\n\nwidowed compared to 6 per cent of men.\n By age 90 and over, more than 84 per cent of women are widowed,\n\ncompared to 54 per cent of men. \n\n  &bullet; Between 1961 and 1986, the proportion of women 65 and\n\nover living alone doubled from 15 per cent to 34 per cent.\n The proportion of men 65 and over living alone increased from 9 per\n\ncent to 14 per cent in the same period.  \n\n  &bullet; In 1986 only 2 per cent of seniors between 65 and 69\n\nlived in institutions, compared to 37 per cent of Canadians 85 and over. \n\n\n\n  &bullet; Twenty-eight per cent of men aged 85 and over live in\n\ninstitutions, compared to 40 per cent of women of that age group. \n\n\n  People over 65 are too often viewed as passive and\n\ndependent.\n In reality, the vast majority are as independent as adults under 65.\n Maximum independence for seniors, as for younger adults, is achieved\n\nthrough interdependent living, that is, in mutually supportive relationships\n\nwith others.  \n\n  Most Canadians receive - and give - a great deal of social\n\nsupport, most of it within their network of family and friends.\n Far less is provided through institutions and social services.\n When aging creates special needs, seniors want to make choices about\n\nthe aid required with daily activities, for example, as well as about the\n\nsupport they give to others.  \n\n  A majority of seniors have the financial resources to live\n\nin their own homes.\n Many seniors also give money to their children.\n However, the income of seniors is concentrated at the lower end of\n\nthe income scale.  \n\n  &bullet; Fifteen per cent of seniors give babysitting help to\n\nfriends and family living outside their home. \n\n  &bullet; Twenty per cent of seniors need help with grocery\n\nshopping and 4 per cent need help with personal care. \n\n  &bullet; Eighty per cent of women and 50 per cent of men over 80\n\ndo their own housework. \n\n  &bullet; Sixty-four per cent of seniors own their own home, most\n\nof them mortgage free. \n\n  &bullet; Eight per cent of older Canadians live in institutions\n\nin which some custody or care is provided.  \n\n  &bullet; In 1986, 45 per cent of families with heads aged 65 and\n\nover had incomes under &dollar;20,000, compared to 18 per cent of families\n\nwith heads under 65. \n\n  &bullet; Fifty per cent of single individuals aged 65 and over\n\nhad incomes under &dollar;10,000 in 1986. \n\n  &bullet; Income support from governments, including Old Age\n\nSecurity and the Guaranteed Income Supplement ( OAS and GIS), is the single\n\nlargest source of income for people aged 65 and over, providing 40 per cent\n\nof the income of older married couples and 58 per cent of the income of\n\nunattached individuals 65 and over.  \n\n  &bullet; Investment income was the second largest source of\n\nincome for seniors in 1986, accounting for 19 per cent of the income of older\n\ncouples. \n\n  &bullet; Wages and salaries accounted for 21 per cent of the\n\nincome of families with heads 65 and over and 3 per cent for unattached\n\nindividuals 65 and over. \n\n\n  Aging and poor health are not synonymous.\n In fact, the vast majority of seniors remain healthy enough to live\n\nindependently.\n Most seniors also believe they are in good health, although reported\n\nhealth status differs widely among those with different income and education\n\nlevels.\n Older people drink less, smoke less and have increased their physical\n\nfitness more than other age groups.  \n\n  Seniors, as a group, are heavy users of health care\n\nfacilities, but extended hospital stays occur only among a small proportion\n\nof older people.\n However, many chronic health conditions usually associated with old\n\nage often require longer term care.  \n\n  But the frequent occurence of specific physiological changes\n\ndoes not mean that seniors are necessarily unhealthy or disabled in any\n\nsignificant way.\n When certain activities do become difficult for seniors, changes in\n\nthe physical and social environment can often compensate for any loss in\n\nfunctional ability.  \n\n  &bullet; Sixty-seven per cent of seniors aged 65 to 74 said their\n\nhealth was good or excellent.\n\n\ngraph \n\n  &bullet; Women over 65 report somewhat poorer health than men\n\nover 65. \n\n  &bullet; Seventy per cent of seniors over 65 stated that life was\n\nnot very or not at all stressful.\n\n\n  &bullet; Fifty-six per cent of Canadians aged 65 to 74 report\n\nvisiting a general practitioner three or more times in the previous year,\n\ncompared to 40 per cent of those aged 45 to 54. \n\n  &bullet; Among older Canadians who consider themselves very poor,\n\n46 per cent say they are in very good or excellent health.\n Sixty-eight per cent of seniors who are upper middle class report the\n\nsame degree of health. \n\n  &bullet; Seventy-two per cent of seniors who have completed\n\npost-secondary education report that they are in very good or excellent\n\nhealth, compared to 35 per cent of seniors who have an elementary education\n\nor less. \n\n  &bullet; Nineteen per cent of Canadians over 65 smoke compared to\n\n37 per cent of those under 55.\n Eighteen per cent of seniors never drink alcoholic beverages,\n\ncompared to 6 per cent of adults under 55. \n\n  &bullet; The proportion of able-bodied seniors who exercised\n\nregularly increased from 50 per cent to 60 per cent between 1976 and 1981.\n\n\ngraph \n\n  &bullet; Seniors account for 49 per cent of hospital patient\n\ndays.\n But a small number of seniors account for most lengthy hospital\n\nstays. \n\n  &bullet; Fifteen per cent of individuals aged 65 to 74 reported\n\ntwo or more disability days in the past two weeks, compared to 12 per cent of\n\nthose aged 45 to 54. \n\n  &bullet; Two out of three Canadians over 65 say they have no\n\nlong-term activity limitations.\n More specifically, 9 per cent of seniors aged 65 to 74 report that\n\ntheir vision limits their activities and 21 per cent are restricted by their\n\nhearing ability. \n\n  &bullet; Although 85 per cent of seniors have at least one\n\nchronic health problem, this does not affect the majority's ability to\n\nfunction independently. \n\n\n  When Canadians retire from the work force, their place in\n\nsociety appears completely altered.\n But seniors continue to participate in numerous other social and\n\neconomic activities.\n They continue to earn income, spend money on goods, donate money,\n\nact as volunteers, vote in elections, use mass media and entertainment, and\n\nsome are students.  \n\n  The concept of mandatory retirement is being challenged\n\nwith a view that ability, rather than chronological age, should be the basis\n\nfor work force participation.\n The ability to choose the time of retirement means much less\n\ndisruption personally.\n It also means that age 65 is becoming a much less socially\n\nsignificant transition.  \n\n  accumulation of a lifetime of experience\n\nand knowledge is far often an under-utilized resource for Canadian society.\n contributions will\n\nbecome more important than ever.  \n\n  &bullet;

based Hemlock Society, which promotes legalized\n\neuthanasia.\n On Aug. 18, the book reached the top of The New York Times list of\n\nbest-selling advice and how-to books.\n But Wantz described Final Exit as a disappointment.\n " It tells you to use Seconal, but you can\'t get\n\nit unless a doctor writes a prescription for you."  \n\n  According to many doctors and legal experts, the popularity of\n\nFinal Exit reflects a growing public preoccupation with terminal illness.\n But some of the experts contend that the book\'s author, Derek\n\nHumphry, founder of the 42,000-member Hemlock Society, represents the radical\n\nfringe of the debate in North America about euthanasia and the rights of the\n\nterminally ill.\n They say that a more accurate measure of public opinion will emerge\n\nfrom a Washington state plebiscite on Nov. 5.\n Voters will be asked to approve or reject a proposed law that would\n\nmake Washington the first American state to let doctors help terminally ill\n\npatients end their lives.\n In Canada, meanwhile, two members of Parliament have introduced\n\nprivate  bills dealing with euthanasia.\n One would strengthen a patient\'s right to refuse treatment, while\n\nthe second would allow terminally ill patients to take their lives after\n\nappearing before a government-appointed referee. \n\n  The success of Final Exit has injected new vigor into the debate\n\nover euthanasia.\n The 192-page book examines in clinical detail various ways of\n\ncommitting suicide.\n\n\ndescribes an unreliable suicide method popularized by movies in which an\n\nindividual injects air into his veins.\n\n\ndescribes death by rattlesnake bite and by driving a car into a tree.\n The book recommends neither method.\n According to Humphry, the best method, because it is quick, clean\n\nand painless, is to take an overdose of barbiturates on an empty stomach and\n\naccompanied by alcohol. \n\n  The &dollar;23.50 book is distributed and promoted by New York\n\nCity-based Carol Publishing Group.\n Carol\'s 34-year-old publisher, Steven Schragis, a co-founder, with\n\nToronto-born Graydon Carter, of the New York-based satirical magazine Spy,\n\nsaid that he was eager to help promote Final Exit because he belongs to the\n\nHemlock Society.\n Initially, Carol Publishing printed a total of 40,000 copies of the\n\nbook, of which about one-half were sold by mail order through the Hemlock\n\nSociety.\n Humphry said that Carol sent 300 review copies to media outlets\n\nacross the United States, but no reviews appeared.\n Then, on July 12, The Wall Street Journal published an article about\n\nthe book, and within 10 days bookstores had sold the entire first edition.\n Hemlock and Carol are now printing another 125,000 copies, and\n\nSchragis said that bookstores have already placed orders for 227,000. \n\n  Two major Canadian bookstore chains, Cole\'s The Book People and\n\nW. H. Smith Classics, were both awaiting delivery of their first copies last\n\nweek.\n Cole\'s president Thomas Bryden said that he expects to have the book\n\nin most of Cole\'s 236 stores by early September.\n Said Charlotte Caplan, a book buyer with the 180-store Smith chain:\n\n " There has been an incredible demand for it."  \n\n  The second printing of Final Exit is likely to begin reaching\n\nbookstores just as another potentially controversial book on suicide is\n\npublished.\n On Sept. 2, Buffalo, N.Y.-based Prometheus Books plans to publish\n\nDr. Jack Kevorkian\'s Prescription: Medicide, subtitled The Goodness of\n\nPlanned Death.\n Kevorkian, who lives in a Detroit suburb, is the inventor of a\n\nso-called suicide machine.\n He gained international attention in June, 1990, when Janet Adkins,\n\na 54-year-old Portland, Ore., woman who had been diagnosed as having\n\nAlzheimer\'s disease, killed herself in a community outside Detroit while\n\nattached to his machine.\n When she pressed a button, the device injected a lethal quantity of\n\npotassium chloride into one of her veins. \n\n  Kevorkian is a man with a mission.\n He told Maclean\'s last week that he is determined to create a new\n\nmedical specialty called obitiatry.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'e8059cfe-3e77-45db-9c28-57187eed08b6', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.830526+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9725397229194641, 'non_english_score': 0.02746027708053589}
{'text': 'FAST TRACK TO FAILURE: experts study the perils of work addiction\n\n\n\n  During the success-oriented 1980s, the term " "\n\nworkaholic" " was often a positive term used to describe fast-track\n\nbaby boomers who earned their corporate reputations with long hours and a\n\ntireless devotion to detail.\n They carried bulging briefcases, worked late and sacrificed their\n\nweekends in the hope of promotions, higher <unclear> unclear word </unclear>\n\n- and higher profits for their employers.\n But some psychologists now say that for some people, the relentless\n\npursuit of on-the-job perfection actually results in diminished productivity.\n Indeed, some experts say that eventually, workaholics can lose their\n\nsense of control over their work and their lives.\n When that occurs, the person who is addicted to work can turn moody,\n\nbecome prone to rages and alienate his or her family, friends and colleagues.\n " At their\n\nworst, workaholics are soulless - there\'s nothing inside, they have lost\n\ntheir integrity."  \n\n  According to Killinger, whose book Workaholics: The Respectable\n\nAddicts was published by Key Porter Books in April, workaholics are men or\n\nwomen who are addicted to working and who, as a result, experience\n\npersonality changes.\n Yet despite the sometimes alarming consequences of the addiction,\n\nKillinger says that the problem is still widely misunderstood.\n She and other experts say that an increasing number of people are\n\nseeking treatment for workaholism.\n Because the addiction takes hold so slowly, Killinger said that\n\nco-workers and spouses tend to dismiss the early symptoms of workaholism -\n\nanxiety, irritability and restlessness - as the temporary side effects of\n\noverwork. \n\n  At the same time, Kenneth Des Roches, an Ottawa-based employment\n\ncounsellor with Peat Marwick Stevenson & Kellogg, a management consulting\n\nfirm, says that employers sometimes make the problem worse by assuming that\n\nsomeone with workaholic attributes will be a model employee.\n By giving a workaholic more responsibility and prestige, says Des\n\nRoches, who regularly counsels individuals suffering from workaholism,\n\nemployers can unwittingly push the workaholic too far.\n Still, Des Roches says that the main problem is the obsession itself.\n " People get a high from their work, and it becomes something\n\nof a vortex that they get caught up in,"  he said. \n " Before long, they need it, and they don\'t want to live\n\nwithout it."   \n\n  Although the word " " workaholism" " has been in\n\nuse for only about 20 years, psychologists say that the addiction has existed\n\nfor much longer.\n They add that the problem has recently gained greater recognition\n\nbecause people in the largest segment of the North American population, those\n\nbetween the ages of 25 and 45, are at the stage in their careers when,\n\naccording to Des Roches, workaholism  " tends to get to people."\n\n\n But Bart, a recovering Vancouver workaholic who at one time juggled a\n\nfull-time job and a private business during 18-hour days, told Maclean\'s that\n\nhis addiction began in his childhood.\n Bart, 55, who asked that his last name be withheld, said that it was\n\nonly by stopping work completely that he was able to deal with his\n\nworkaholism.\n " Work is a way of avoiding your feelings, like booze or\n\ndrugs,"  he said. \n " Work gives you the feeling that you\'re in control."\n\n  \n\n  Killinger, who has studied workaholism for eight years, says\n\nthat the classic workaholic starts off as a perfectionist who desperately\n\nneeds the approval of others.\n Over time, she says, working becomes a compulsion and, finally, a\n\nsingle-minded pursuit of self-glorification that can lead to emotional\n\nproblems and personality changes.\n Striving for power and control, workaholics suffer from chronic\n\nfatigue and guilt, are racked by fears and sometimes even become incapable of\n\ndistinguishing right from wrong.\n For her part, Susan Butt, a psychologist at the University of British\n\nColumbia in Vancouver, says that workaholics reach the crisis stage when they\n\nbegin to lose control over their lives.\n " they lose\n\ntheir sense of well-being."  \n\n  According to Killinger, workaholics are capable of lying,\n\ncheating and, in extreme cases, violence if it serves their purposes.\n Increasingly bound to their work, yet feeling out of control, they\n\nmay become impatient with their children and lash out at their spouses.\n " I am\n\nrealizing how much damage is done to the spouse."  \n\n  According to Des Roches, companies and their employees have to\n\nrecognize workaholism as a risk factor in order to prevent it from\n\ncausing problems in the workplace.\n " Many companies are beginning to realize that being obsessed\n\nwith work is counterproductive,"  he said.\n Individual employees, he added, must learn to work within realistic\n\nlimits and not rely on work to feed their egos.\n Otherwise, the successes gained from overwork can ultimately lead to\n\npainful failure. \n\n  Killinger says that many work addicts can be cured if they get\n\nhelp early.\n Most important, she said, was for them to gain an understanding of\n\ntheir own feelings, and a realization of how their addiction has harmed their\n\nfamilies and friends.\n " In most cases, what they have left behind is a pile of\n\nbroken lives,"  she said.\n Killinger added that if workaholics can feel remorse for the damage\n\nthey have done, then they can usually recover.\n But, for the minority of workaholics who are unable to do that, the\n\nfuture is likely to turn into a fast track to failure, both on and off the\n\njob.  \n\n\n\n\n  The slender, intense young man, with wire-rimmed glasses and\n\nimpeccably groomed hair, says that he has a solid marriage, two happy\n\nchildren and a rewarding job.\n But, for three years, the Toronto computer technician found that he\n\nincreasingly wanted to have sex with prostitutes.\n After finishing his night shift at a downtown office, he said, he\n\nwould drive along streets that he knew prostitutes favored.\n He said that he watched them, regularly talked to them and\n\noccasionally paid for their services.\n But, he said, by early last year he had become convinced that his\n\nobsession was out of control, and he began seeing a psychotherapist.\n While he chose to turn to a professional for help, thousands of other\n\nNorth American men and women have chosen a different way of dealing with\n\nsimilar obsessions.\n They have joined self-help groups, modelled on Alcoholics Anonymous (\n\nAA), to overcome what they regard as a damaging and potentially dangerous\n\nproblem: so-called sexual addiction. \n\n  The self-help approach to sexual problems began to flourish\n\nduring the late 1970s and, since then, three major organizations have\n\nemerged: Boston-based Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous ( SLAA),\n\nMinneapolis-based Sex Addicts Anonymous ( SAA) and California-based\n\nSexaholics Anonymous ( SA).\n All of them have members in Canada, although they are reluctant to\n\ndisclose details about their activities.\n One of the leading proponents of the theory that sexual activity can\n\nbe addictive is Patrick Carnes, a Minneapolis-based family therapist.\n He operates an in-patient clinic that treats people he describes as\n\nsexually addicted individuals.\n " Sex addicts do things even though it may cost them their\n\nmarriage, their job and lots of money,"  Carnes told Maclean\'s. \n\n\n\n\n  Indeed, individuals who claim to be sexually addicted frequently\n\nadmit that their sexual behavior is partly due to other personal problems.\n A 31-year-old Minneapolis man named Bob, who has been a member of SAA\n\nfor two years, said that he was a victim of incest as a child and later\n\ndeveloped alcohol and drug problems.\n The man said that he is bisexual and, before joining SAA, sometimes\n\nhad daily sexual encounters.\n He admitted that he visited homosexual bathhouses and massage parlors\n\nfor anonymous sex, and occasionally purchased sex from prostitutes of both\n\nsexes.\n " I don\'t go to bathhouses, massage parlors,\n\nbars or any place that might tempt me."  \n\n  But many mental health professionals dispute the notion that sex\n\ncan be addictive and warn that treatment based on the AA model should be\n\naccompanied by professional therapy.\n Sidney Folb, a Toronto psychologist who has treated people with\n\naddictions and sexual problems for 20 years, said that excessive sexual\n\nactivity is frequently connected to drug or alcohol abuse.\n He added that he has rarely encountered anyone whose only problem is\n\ncompulsive sexual behavior.\n Howard Ruppel, a former sex therapist who is now executive director\n\nof the Iowa-based Society for the Scientific Study of Sex, also expressed\n\nskepticism about sexual addiction.\n " It incredibly oversimplifies the issues.\n I see this as a catchy, marketable tool that some people are using to\n\nencourage negative attitudes about sex."  \n\n  But those who are involved with self-help groups dismiss the\n\ncriticism of therapists and psychologists.\n The manager of SAA\'s national office in Minneapolis, a 29-year-old\n\nman who identified himself only as Douglas, said that he joined the\n\norganization four years ago.\n Before that, he said, he was obsessed by pornography and was\n\nconstantly cheating on girlfriends by looking for other sexual partners.\n " I felt compelled to do what I was doing.\n Sex addicts experience powerlessness over their sexual behavior.\n\n Douglas said that since joining SAA, he has dated eight women but\n\nbecame sexually involved with only one. \n\n  The self-help groups rely on the 12-step program first developed\n\nby AA to deal with alcoholism.\n The same principles have been applied to a number of other problems,\n\nincluding drug addiction, compulsive gambling and overeating.\n Among other things, the AA program urges participants to admit that\n\nthey are powerless to control their problem.\n They are advised to make an inventory of the wrongs that they have\n\ncommitted and the people whom they have hurt.\n As well, participants are urged to accept the existence of a god, or\n\nsome form of " higher power," and to try to rely on that power to help\n\novercome their problems. \n\n  The major difference among the three main groups that deal with\n\npeople who are excessively sexually active is in their definitions of\n\n" " sexual sobriety." "\n Two of the groups, SAA and SLAA, attract a few homosexuals, while\n\nSA\'s rigid approach tends to discourage gay participation.\n The most conservative, and secretive, group is SA, which was founded\n\nin 1979 and is based in Simi Valley, Calif., about 60 km north of Los\n\nAngeles.\n A woman called Nan, who described herself as an executive secretary,\n\nsaid during a telephone interview that SA members must refrain from any type\n\nof sexual activity outside  " a traditional, legal, heterosexual\n\nmarriage." \n She said that there are SA groups across the United States and in\n\nCanada, Europe and South America.\n But she declined to disclose the number of groups or total\n\nmembership. \n\n  A woman employee at SLAA\'s national office in Boston said that\n\nthe organization has 850 groups, mostly in the United States and Canada.\n She said that SLAA allows its members to create their own definition\n\nof sexual sobriety.\n " Everybody comes into a group with different behavior that\n\nis making their life unmanageable,"  said the woman, who declined to\n\ngive her name,  " so you create your own bottom line." \n A Toronto spokesman named Peter said that there are several SLAA\n\ngroups in the city. \n\n  SAA, which has groups in Vancouver, Winnipeg and Ottawa, also\n\nallows its members to define sexual sobriety in consultation with other\n\nmembers.\n Douglas, the manager of the national office in Minneapolis, said that\n\nSAA has 350 groups across the United States.\n He added that about 80 per cent of the participants are male.\n " When people get into recovery, they\'re generally not in\n\ngreat shape,"  said Douglas. \n " They\'ve usually suffered major consequences, such as\n\ndivorce, job loss or arrest."   \n\n  During the past six years, about 1,700 patients have checked into\n\nthe 50-bed Sexual Dependency Unit at the Golden Valley Health Center near\n\nMinneapolis.\n Family therapist Carnes, Who is founder of the unit, said that 35-day\n\nprogram that he supervises involves group discussions about excessive sexual\n\nbehaviour and instruction by physicians and psychotherapists on such subjects\n\nas healthy sexuality and the causes of addictive behavior.\n Carnes said that full recovery from sexual addiction can take up to\n\nfive years. \n\n  According to Carnes, self-described sex addicts often share\n\ncommon backgrounds and personality traits.\n A book by Carnes, entitled Don\'t Call It Love, which will be\n\npublished in March, is based on a survey of 1,000 recovering sex addicts.\n Carnes said that 83 per cent of the people he surveyed had a second\n\naddiction, usually alcohol or drugs, and a similar percentage said that they\n\nhad experienced sexual abuse as children.\n He also found that 27 per cent of the sex addicts he talked to had\n\nbeen dismissed from jobs, demoted or arrested as a result of their sexual\n\nbehavior.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd7307322-e518-4b2d-9dcc-8626544d5ec0', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.831882+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9815917015075684, 'non_english_score': 0.01840829849243164}
{'text': 'By his own admission, Willard Estey was a compromise choice for\n\nthe Supreme Court of Canada.\n " They happened to need a guy from Ontario and they couldn\'t\n\nagree on who,"  recalled Estey of his 1977 appointment to the Supreme\n\nCourt bench just nine months after becoming Ontario\'s chief justice.\n The deadlock was resolved, said Estey, who at the time was reluctant\n\nto leave the Ontario court, by  " grabbing the Ontario chief justice."\n\n\n Now retired from the Supreme Court and practising law in Toronto, the\n\nhighly regarded former judge added:  " I got moved into that job the\n\nsame way I was moved around by the Air Force during the war." \n And Estey, like all other justices of Canada\'s top court, began his\n\nnew job without being subjected to the public examination that U.S. Supreme\n\nCourt nominees have to undergo according to the American Constitution. \n\n  Canadian Supreme Court judges are named by the governor general on\n\nthe advice of the prime minister.\n The only fixed requirements are that at least three of the judges must\n\nbe members of the Quebec bar, and that any appointee must have been a member\n\nof a Canadian bar for at least 10 years.\n As well, all federal judges have been screened since 1967 by the\n\nCanadian Bar Association and, since 1988, by a five-member advisory committee\n\nmade up of federal and provincial legal authorities that privately assesses\n\ncandidates. \n\n  In practice, the power to shape the composition of the Supreme\n\nCourt has rested with the prime minister, who is under no legal obligation to\n\nfollow the advisory committee\'s recommendations.\n Since Prime Minister Brian Mulroney took office in 1984, he has\n\nappointed eight of the nine current justices, and some Canadians have\n\ncomplained that the present appointment process could allow a prime minister\n\nto stack the court with political friends.\n As a result, some critics of the system have urged the introduction\n\nof a public review process for prospective justices.\n Said Frederick Vaughan, a political science professor at Ontario\'s\n\nUniversity of Guelph:  " With the introduction of the charter of\n\nrights in 1982, these people exercise extraordinary power. \n They should undergo some measure of public scrutiny by our\n\nlegislators.  "  \n\n  But other experts contend that such a process would merely graft\n\nanother element of the U.S. political system onto Canada\'s parliamentary form\n\nof government.\n And even those calling for changes to the system, including Vaughan,\n\nacknowledge that all Supreme Court justices since the 1960s have been well\n\nqualified.\n " The legal community does a very good job of regulating\n\nitself and weeding out bad lawyers,"  said Vaughan.\n But as the influence of the Supreme Court grows, calls for an open\n\nreview of new judges may increase.  \n\n\n THE WAR OF THE SEXES: new calls for rules on sexual harassment\n\n\n\n  The 44-year-old black woman, who took her complaint to Ontario\'s\n\n Compensation Board, said that she was constantly harassed\n\nduring a six-year period in the 1980s by male co-workers at the\n\nColgate-Palmolive Canada soap factory in the Toronto area.\n The woman, whose name was not made public, worked on a packing line\n\nand said that men there would frequently leave obscene drawings in her\n\nlocker, make racist and sexist remarks and, in one incident, gave her a piece\n\nof soap carved in the form of a penis.\n Despite a complaint to her union and to the company\'s management, the\n\nwoman said that she received little support and eventually suffered a nervous\n\nbreakdown.\n\n\nCompensation Board hearings officer ordered the company to pay an\n\nas-yet-undetermined amount for illnesses that stemmed from the stress of\n\nenduring sexual harassment on the job.\n Colgate officials vowed to fight the award, but late last month\n\nwithdrew their appeal.\n one word\n\n</unclear> complaint for victims of sexual harassment in the workplace.\n Still, many experts say that it remains widespread in Canadian\n\nsociety - and often is not dealt with seriously enough. \n\n  The dramatic confrontation this month between University of\n\nOklahoma law professor Anita Hill and her former employer, U.S. Supreme Court\n\nnominee Clarence Thomas, focused new attention on the issue.\n After Hill testified before the Senate judiciary committee in\n\nWashington that Thomas harassed her by repeatedly asking for dates, boasting\n\nof his sexual prowess and describing pornographic movies, the Senate last\n\nweek ratified Thomas\'s appointment to the court by a vote of 52 to 48. \n\n  For its part, the Supreme Court of Canada, in deciding a case in\n\n1989, defined sexual harassment as  " unwelcome conduct of a sexual\n\nnature that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse\n\njob-related consequences for the victims of the harassment." \n According to studies carried out in the United States and Canada,\n\nsexual harassment in the workplace affects an estimated 80 to 90 per cent of\n\nwomen at some point in their lives.\n ( Only a small number of men ever complain of sexual harassment.)\n In 1990, federal and provincial human rights commissions received\n\nhundreds of complaints of sexual harassment in the workplace.\n Said Maxwell Yalden, chief commissioner of the federal human rights\n\ncommission:  " It is a problem that is very much present and very much\n\nfelt by women across the country." \n " Whatever the numbers are, it\'s a shattering\n\nexperience for the individual."  \n\n  Telling jokes, putting an arm around a co-worker or asking a\n\ncolleague for a date is not, according to experts in the field, unacceptable\n\nbehavior in the right context.\n But they concede that what does constitute sexual harassment in the\n\nworkplace is difficult for some people to grasp.\n Experts say that the offending behavior typically takes one of two\n\nforms.\n The first occurs when there is an implied or explicit link between\n\nrequested sexual favors and a promotion or job security.\n The second form of harassment occurs when a person - particularly a\n\nsuperior - subjects an employee to unwelcome attentions that create a\n\npoisoned, uncomfortable or hostile working environment.\n\n\nsaid lawyer and criminologist Judith Osborne, harassment policy co-ordinator\n\nat Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C.\n " It\'s not always the blatant touching, feeling or making\n\nsexual requests.\n It\'s often wrapped up as a joke - often not a very funny joke."\n\n \n " In many workplaces, those kinds of off-color\n\nconversations - the sort of dissecting of people\'s sex lives - is seen as\n\nbeing the regular Monday-morning conversation."  \n\n  Many experts say that the reason sexual harassment has become\n\nmore of an issue in recent years is the increasing number of women in the\n\nworkforce.\n The resulting change in rules for workplace behavior, they add, has\n\nconfused many men.\n " Men say, \'Anyone could accuse me of sexual harassment and I\n\ndidn\'t mean to do it at all,\'  " said Nancy Adamson, co-ordinator for\n\nthe status of women and a sexual-harassment adviser at Carleton University in\n\nOttawa.\n " I say, think about whether you would like someone to do\n\nthis to your mother, your daughter, your wife.\n\n\n\n Adamson and others concede that it is difficult to make people fully\n\nunderstand the seriousness of sexual harassment.\n\n You can\'t say to men, \'Imagine if a woman were doing this to you.\'\n\n\n  Still, some critics maintain that existing definitions of sexual\n\nharassment are too vague and can have the effect of trapping innocent people.\n said Howard Levitt, a\n\nToronto lawyer who specializes in wrongful-dismissal suits.\n\n\n\n Levitt also claims that the potential exists for people to\n\nfrivolously accuse someone of sexual harassment.\n " The very fact of the allegation is so\n\ndestructive to their career that the person who is being accused is likely to\n\npay a tremendous amount of money to keep the accuser quiet."  \n\n  The effects of genuine sexual harassment on a victim can be\n\ndevastating according to experts.\n " It has a real, sinister, debilitating kind of effect on\n\none\'s self-esteem,"  said Debi Forsyth-Smith, president of the\n\nHalifax-based Nova Scotia Advisory Council on the Status of Women.\n " People say, \'Why is this happening to me?\'\n And sexual harassment generally happens in isolation, behind a\n\nclosed door when nobody else is around."  \n As well, victims are often harassed by superiors.\n " When you are in a position of power and you\n\nstart touching or making sexual jokes or innuendoes, those under you have to\n\nthink about their position before they challenge your behavior." \n\n\n\n  Following through with a formal complaint in Canada can be a\n\ndaunting and lengthy process for sexual-harassment victims.\n According to Yalden, the victim will usually file a complaint with\n\nthe federal or provincial human rights commission against both the alleged\n\nharasser and the employer ( under Canadian law, employers have a\n\nresponsibility for a harassment-free workplace).\n If officials believe that there are grounds for the complainant\'s\n\ncase, they will begin gathering evidence. \n\n  Throughout the process, Yalden explained, the commission will\n\nmake every attempt to arrive at an informal settlement between the parties.\n If none can be reached, the commission will, if warranted, appoint a\n\nconciliator to try to find a settlement.\n Failing that, a tribunal can be established to hear testimony in\n\npublic.\n Finally, the board reaches a conclusion and issues an order, which\n\ncould involve the awarding of financial damages, the reinstatement of a job\n\nor the granting of a promotion that was previously denied as a result of the\n\ncomplainant\'s refusal to comply with the harasser\'s demands.\n The employer and the individual charged with harassment could then\n\nappeal the commission\'s decision before the courts.\n In some cases, the process can take years before all the appeals have\n\nbeen heard and a final ruling has been rendered. \n\n  Some experts maintain that victims of sexual harassment in the\n\nworkplace are not served well under the current system.\n Because sexual harassment is not a criminal offence, a complainant\n\nhas no recourse but to go to a human rights commission.\n In most provinces, commissions have large backlogs of cases.\n Another problem, according to Levitt, is that the commissions tend to\n\n " give notoriously puny awards for anything other than proof of\n\neconomic loss." \n Financial damages typically range from &dollar;250 to &dollar;3,000.\n Indeed, the consequences of filing a complaint may outweigh the\n\nbenefits.\n " have to go to the human rights\n\ncommission, make a complaint, prove they\'re harassed, wait a number of years\n\nand, even if they win, it might be difficult to get a job somewhere else\n\nbecause they\'re seen as shit-disturbers." \n But ultimately, experts agree, most victims of sexual harassment are\n\nreally only seeking one thing: for the offensive behavior to stop.  \n\n\n\n\n  Edmonton Police Chief Douglas McNally seemed shaken last week\n\nwhen he appeared in public at his headquarters.\n Just 3 hours earlier, Edmonton detectives had arrested one of their\n\nown, Const. Roy Gordon Lawrence, 33, in a car a few blocks from his home in\n\nSt. Albert, a suburb of the Alberta capital.\n Charged with kidnapping and sexually assaulting two eight-year-old\n\nboys and a 10-year-old girl, Lawrence was immediately suspended without pay\n\nfrom his beat at the West Edmonton Mall shopping centre.\n McNally, who said that he and the Edmonton police force were\n\nembarrassed by the case, declared that the matter was an  " isolated\n\nincident"  and insisted that the vast majority of his officers\n\npossessed  " high moral standards." \n But some Edmontonians expressed concern.\n " You teach your kids that the police are their friends and\n\nyou go to them when you are in trouble,"  said Guy L\'Heureux, 38, an\n\nEdmonton housepainter.\n\n\n  Lawrence\'s arrest followed several recent scandals that McNally\n\nacknowledged had shaken public confidence in the Edmonton force.\n Twice during the past two months, city policemen have been charged\n\nwith drinking-and-driving-related offences.\n And in June, Const. Jens Goldgrabe, 30, was sentenced to six years in\n\nprison after being convicted of sexually assaulting a suspected shoplifter.\n " a disgrace to the uniform,"\n\n had forced the handcuffed woman to perform oral sex on him and call\n\nhim  " master." \n In another incident the previous month, a judge authorized private\n\ncharges of assault and torture against three police officers who allegedly\n\nroughed up a 32-year-old man on the steps of a courthouse in May, 1990. \n\n  Other scandals have also hit the Edmonton police force in recent\n\nyears.\n In 1989, Const. Jerry Donovan, 34, who had been charged with the\n\nsexual assault of a female officer in 1988, shot and killed his wife, Const.\n\nShannon Donovan, 28, before fatally shooting himself.\n In the same year, Hans Bredeman, 40, a 17-year veteran of the\n\ndepartment, was sentenced to 15 years in prison after being convicted of\n\ndevising a plan that resulted in his mistress shooting and injuring his wife,\n\nFaye.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'dd5c27e2-886d-4a91-8f0a-2e6de60640b4', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.833149+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9757866859436035, 'non_english_score': 0.024213314056396484}
{'text': 'by Stephen Stamp\n\n  If there is a common thread among the astronomers at UVic, it is\n\nthe sense that they find the universe so awe-inspiring that they have no\n\nchoice but to try to learn its secrets and to try to communicate their\n\nfindings and their sense of awe to others.\n Their activities range from lab instructor Russ Robb demonstrating the\n\npower of the sun for high school students by burning a pencil with a\n\ntelescope, to Dr. Chris Pritchet determining the distance of quasars\n\nmillions of light-years away. \n\n  The diversity and quality of astronomy research being\n\nconducted at UVic is among the reasons that the Herzberg Institute of\n\nAstrophysics ( HIA) of the National Research Council plans to relocate\n\nfour of its sections to the university from their present location in Ottawa.\n The Institute is still awaiting final approval for the move, but the\n\ngovernment of B.C. has committed &dollar;22 million for the construction\n\nof a new building on campus to house it.\n The HIA was established in 1975 and is a significant world-class\n\ncentre for space sciences and astrophysics.\n The HIA cited the work of UVic\'s astronomers and their links with\n\nother institutions such as the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory ( DAO),\n\nwhich is a section of the HIA, as primary reasons why it wishes to move to\n\nUVic.\n This move would bring about 100 more professional scientists and\n\nsupport staff to the university and would create an improved environment for\n\nUVic\'s already admirable graduate and undergraduate programs in physics\n\nand astronomy. \n\n  The roots of UVic\'s astronomy program can be traced to\n\nSaskatchewan in the 1920s and  .\n\n\nents\'  farm and stare upwards, captivated by the beauty and wonder of the\n\nsky.\n " I\'ve had a long-standing interest in the stars since I was\n\na boy,"  Climenhaga says, and  " Saskatchewan\'s clear, trans\n\n<l> parent sky"  was perfect for viewing them. \n\n  " it\'s human curiosity to want\n\nto find out how the universe functions. \n You want to understand the physical universe.\n "\n\n\n For much of his early life, Climenhaga didn\'t have much time to\n\nworry about it, either.\n He helped his father run the family farm for several years before\n\nenrolling at the University of Saskatchewan at the age of 25, where he earned\n\nhis B.Sc. in honours math and physics.\n He taught at Regina College while completing his master\'s degree and\n\nthen took a job at Victoria College in 1949, at age 33.\n At the time, he was one of only two physics instructors at the\n\ncollege. \n\n  In Victoria, his interest in the sky was rekindled when he worked\n\nas a summer research assistant at the DAO.\n The lure was strong enough that in 1954 Climenhaga took a\n\ntwo-year unpaid leave of absence to earn his Ph.D. in astronomy from the\n\nUniversity of Michigan.\n Two years after returning to victoria College, he became the first\n\nhead of the Department of Physics, a post he held for 11 years. \n\n  During that time, Climenhaga convinced the university\n\nadministration to add an astronomy component to the physics department.\n The first astronomy courses were introduced in 1964, shortly after\n\nVictoria College had become UVic.  \n He continued to instruct students and conduct research full-time\n\nuntil his retirement in 1982.\n He was Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science from 1969-72.\n Since his retirement, Climenhaga has continued his research and has\n\ntaught courses in the Department of Physics and Astronomy most years. \n\n  As impressive as his academic record has been, Climenhaga has\n\nearned an equally illustrious reputation as a researcher.\n His primary focus has been on the carbon 12 to carbon 13 ratio in\n\ncarbon stars, which are stars with an enhanced abundance of carbon.\n By studying the nuclear reactions in a star and measuring how much\n\ncarbon 13 is present, one can learn about how heat is produced in the star.\n\n\n\n  Climenhaga has also worked with Dr. Jan Smolinski of the\n\nCopernicus Astronomical Centre in Torun, Poland, studying\n\nsuper-giant stars.  \n To demonstrate how enormous one of these stars is, Climenhaga\n\nexplains that if the centre of one were at the centre of our sun, the outer\n\nedge would be around Mars.\n The pair of astronomers has concentrated on interesting features of\n\n spectra, which sometimes involve two or three gaseous\n\nenvelopes expanding outwards at different rates. \n\n  The extent to which Climenhaga is respected by his peers is shown\n\nby the honours which he has received.\n Upon his retirement in 1982, the dome and astronomy laboratory on top\n\nof the Elliott Building were named for him.\n In 1985, an asteroid was officially named Minor Planet No. 3034\n\nClimenhaga, in honour of his research, his academic record, and his\n\nimportance in establishing the astronomy program at UVic. \n\n  That program has grown to include several world-class\n\nastronomers.\n Dr. Don VandenBerg is an Associate Professor and is recognized\n\nas one of the world\'s premier theorists in the evolution of stars.\n In 1989, he received the E.W.R. Steacie Award, one of the most\n\nprestigious awards for science and engineering in Canada.\n " a star can be modelled by solving a\n\nnumber of fairly straightforward differential equations, though a\n\nthorough understanding of nuclear physics and thermodynamics is required."\n\n \n\n  VandenBerg has developed a sophisticated code that creates\n\ncomputer-generated models of stars.\n These models allow astronomers to determine with great precision,\n\namong other things, the ages of stars, by simulating their evolution.\n For example, with VandenBerg\'s models one can follow the sun from its\n\nbeginning, when it was just a ball of gases with no nuclear reactions occur\n\n<l> ring, to its present state.\n He can then theorize what will happen in the next five to 10\n\nbillion years. \n\n  To those who may wonder why he wants to look billions of years\n\ninto the past or future, VandenBerg says that he is  " just\n\noverwhelmed by the idea that relatively simple equations can describe so much\n\nabout the universe. \n I find it almost unbelievable that one can understand as well\n\nas one does something as complicated as the sun.  " \n It is the pure pursuit of knowledge that attracts him to astronomy.\n He also likens the &aeligature;sthetic pleasure of his work to that\n\nof a musician\'s. \n\n  " on the fence between theory\n\nand observation." \n Collaborating extensively with the DAO, he does very little observing\n\nhimself.\n Rather, he engages in critical comparison of observation and\n\ntheory.\n Thanks in large part to VandenBerg\'s research, theoretical models are\n\nnow becoming more and more sophisticated and more closely tied to\n\nobservations.\n This correspondence allows astronomers to view estimates of the ages\n\nof stars with much more confidence.\n In fact, the ages VandenBerg has derived for stars are now used\n\nworldwide as the standard ages, and his work has led astronomers to regard\n\nhis estimate of 14 billion years for the age of the universe as quite reli\n\n<l> able. \n\n  While VandenBerg has been trying to establish the age of the\n\nuniverse, colleague Dr. Chris Pritchet has been busy determining its\n\nsize.\n " but\n\ngive us two or three years and I think we\'ll be able to tell you." \n\n\n\n  Pritchet studies galaxies, both very distant and closer, to\n\nestablish a distance scale of the universe; that is, how far apart objects\n\nare from each other.\n He says that because the universe is expanding, the distances\n\nare increasing.\n This leads to the conclusion that the universe was once compressed,\n\nuntil the build-up of heat caused a giant explosion which has become known as\n\nthe Big Bang.\n The force of the explosion has been pushing the edges of the universe\n\noutward ever since. \n\n  Because of the great distances involved in his research, Pritchet\n\nsays that a characteristic of his work is that he uses very big telescopes.\n Rather than creating photographic plates in telescopes to\n\nproduce images of the objects he views, Pritchet primarily relies on a charge\n\ncoupled device ( commonly called a CCD) which turns images into data on\n\nsilicon chips.\n Those data can then be fed into Pritchet\'s computer to be reduced,\n\nconverting them to a format in which they can be used for calculations.\n " for every nigh observing, I probably\n\nspend 10 nights or more reducing data."  \n\n  " Things are happening very quickly in astronomy now,"\n\n Pritchet says,  " because of advances in detector, tele <l>\n\nscope, and computer technology. \n We could hardly do anything if we didn\'t have complex computers to\n\nreduce data.  " \n An example of the advancing technology is a project in which Pritchet\n\nis involved which would see Canada, the United States, and Britain work\n\ntogether to build and operate two of the largest telescopes in the world (\n\napproximately eight metres in diameter) over the next 10 years.\n Pritchet has also worked on the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope in\n\nHawaii and, along with VandenBerg and Dr. David Hartwick, has time booked on\n\nthe Hubble space telescope.\n This telescope was launched by NASA in 1989 and is expected to\n\nproduce extremely accurate images. \n\n  NASA is working to overcome current problems which at\n\npresent make the Hubble useless for many astronomical purposes.\n This prospect is exciting, Pritchet says, because a space telescope\n\neliminates the distortion caused by the earth\'s atmosphere and thus provides\n\nmuch sharper images. \n\n  " intrinsically a very exciting\n\nscience. \n There is some of the same beauty and elegance in modern astronomical\n\nscience that can be found, though in a completely different form, in such\n\nthings as productions in the fine arts.  "  \n\n  Hartwick, who has been at UVic since 1968, has made breakthroughs\n\nin determining the mass of galaxies.\n 11\n\n times that of the sun, but thanks in large part to Hartwick we now know\n\nthat it is at least 10 times bigger than that.\n He was part of a group of scientists who proved that about 90\n\npercent of the matter in the galaxy is  " dark matter," \n\nwhich can\'t be observed by telescopes.\n This discovery has radically altered estimates of the mass of the uni\n\n<l> verse as a whole. \n\n  Dr. Colin Scarfe came to UVic in 1965 primarily because of its\n\nassociation with the DAO and says that he has probably put in more\n\nobserving time at the DAO than any other outside observer.\n The major emphasis in his work involves determining basic\n\nastrophysical quantities of binary stars, including their stellar masses and\n\nradial velocities.\n Scarfe measures the Doppler shift, which is the shift in a star\'s\n\nspectrum due to its motion.\n For over 20 years he has also run a program from Climenhaga\n\nObservatory to study period changes in binary stars which eclipse each other.\n He uses a photometre attached to the main telescope to time the\n\neclipses and record the times at which the light is faintest. \n\n  Dr. Ann Gower has been a member of the Department of Physics and\n\nAstronomy at UVic since 1973.\n She also sees a connection between astronomy and the arts.\n " Beginning to achieve an understanding of the universe\n\nmakes one appreciate it more, just as getting to know about the theory of\n\nmusic lets you appreciate Chopin\'s music even more."   \n\n  Gower is an expert in radio astronomy.\n This involves studying very distant quasars and galaxies which give\n\nout an unusually high intensity of radio waves.\n She often works with the Very Large Array ( VLA) in New Mexico,\n\nmaking radio images of objects.\n Of particular interest is what brought about the existence of\n\nthe radio galaxies.  \n Another interesting aspect is the common occurrence in radio\n\ngalaxies of jets shooting out from either side of the core of a galaxy.\n At the core is an object which may be a black hole.\n A passing galaxy may disturb material near it and cause it to fall\n\ninto the hole, releasing tremendous amount of energy which may power the\n\njets.\n There are a large number of people in the field, trying to find out\n\nhow and why the process occurs. \n\n  " The feeling of studying the distant universe is so\n\nawe-inspiring,"  Gower says.\n She also finds that students are very interested in astronomy.\n Gower\n\nsays.\n An indication of how devoted she is to the task can be seen on the\n\nfirst day of each course she instructs.\n She brings her camera to class and photographs each student to help\n\nher learn their names.\n But carrying out her own research is also very important to Gower,\n\nboth for its own sake and because it renews her excitement and enthusiasm to\n\nreturn to the classroom and pass on to students how exciting the world of\n\nastronomy is.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1ea254a6-9134-4ed6-b678-0f14cf3a7b1d', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.834506+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9813544750213623, 'non_english_score': 0.018645524978637695}
{'text': 'Keeping the tall-grass prairie alive and well in the heart\n\nof Winnipeg  \n\n\n  It\'s the middle of a hot and breezy summer afternoon on the\n\nprairie and all around the hum of grass-hoppers, crickets and sparrows drones\n\non.\n A small group of school children follows a naturalist on a voyage of\n\nexploration through one of the most unusual museums in Canada.\n On all sides the concrete dwellings of a modern city are held at bay\n\nby a low chain-link fence. \n\n  It\'s hard to believe that these 30 acres of tall-grass prairie,\n\nwith over 100 different types of flowers growing in seeming disorder, can\n\nremain undisturbed in the midst of a busy metropolis.\n But that\'s exactly what the Living Prairie Museum attempts to do.\n For centuries the prairie has withstood all that Mother Nature\n\ncould muster - drought, fire, extreme temperatures and grazing - why\n\nshould the progress and political storms of modern day Winnipeg be any\n\ndifferent? \n\n  The great St. James controversy of 1970, when preservationists\n\nwere pitted against developers over the future of the 150 acres of\n\nprairie in the city\'s heartland, was one tempest the prairie endured and to\n\nwhich the Museum owes its very existence.\n The spirit of the fight lives on, especially in Pete de Wet, an\n\n87-year-old naturalist who angrily swung his cane at politicians during the\n\ncontroversy to such effect that the vote was tipped in favour of preserving\n\nthe land. \n\n  In 1968, a Manitoba subcommittee of the International Biological\n\nProgram recognized that the true or tall-grass prairie was in peril.\n Once occupying one and a half million acres in the south-central\n\nregion of the province, it now covered less than one per cent of its former\n\nrange. \n After great debate, the Museum was created in 1971 as a City of\n\nWinnipeg park.\n Today, lack of funding and political will is again threatening the\n\npark\'s existence. \n\n  The Living Prairie Museum protects North America\'s largest\n\nand finest remnant of undisturbed tall-grass prairie.\n\n\nterfly enthusiasts and birdwatchers every year, it offers educators the\n\nopportunity for study and provides visitors the chance to discover that\n\nprairie means more than flatlands and grain fields.\n It\'s a complex ecosystem, shared by a variety of wildflowers,\n\ngrasses, birds and animals that have adapted to survive their extreme\n\nenvironment. \n\n  From early spring until late fall, the Museum\'s small\n\ninterpretive center functions as the starting point for visitors, who\n\nassume that the squat brown building is the main attraction.\n But the Living Prairie Museum is not conventional by any\n\nstandards.\n says Cheryl Neil\n\n<l> sen, one of the Museum\'s naturalists.   " The real museum is\n\noutside."   \n\n  Surrounded by commercial and residential development, it\'s a tiny\n\noasis of prairie grasses and wildflowers where no flower beds or artificial\n\nlandscaping exists.\n Here, as people wander the narrow grass paths, they are able to\n\nexperience the uniqueness and diversity of a true prairie in much the same\n\nway the early settlers of the region did. \n\n  Their first impression will be of the native grasses that sweep\n\nthe area, from the knee-high spear grass (  Stipa spartea  ) , to\n\nthe elevated reaches of the big bluestem (  Andropogon gerardi  ) ,\n\nwhich stretch shoulder high and beyond. \n\n  " The premier species of the tall-grass prairie is the\n\nbig bluestem, which can reach six to eight feet ( 1.8 - 2.4 m) in more\n\nsoutherly prairies,"  says Neilson.   " But the Museum\n\ncontains 160 prairie plant species.\n Silphium integrifolium\n\n ) , compass plant (  S. laciniatum  ) and prairie dock ( \n\nS. terebinthinaceum  ) were reintroduced to the area during one of the\n\nMuseum\'s restoration projects."   \n\n  The tall-grass prairie boasts some of the hardiest members of the\n\nplant kingdom.\n Their well-developed root systems, some reaching down more than 23\n\nfeet ( 7 m), enabled them to withstand the harsh realities of their\n\nenvironment, including yearly temperatures ranging from - 40&degree;C to\n\n+ 40&degree;C, as well as sporadic and torrential rains and an\n\never-present wind. \n\n  " This is what makes prairie flowers so hardy and so\n\ndifferent from other flowers,"  says J.H. Ball, a local\n\nenvironmentalist.   " Even in very hot or dry periods you can\n\nalways find three or four different species in bloom.\n\n\n  April, known as Crocus Days at the park, marks the beginning of a\n\nfloral show that will continue until the first snowfall in October.\n Most of the Museum\'s visitors arrive in the final cool weeks of the\n\nmonth to celebrate the coming of spring and the arrival of the prairie crocus\n\n(  Anemone patens  ) . \n\n  Unlike its English namesake, this crocus ( also known as the\n\nPasque flower and the blue tulip), is not grown from bulb but from seed.\n When it\'s cloudy, it appears as a thumb-sized mauve flower bud\n\npushing up through the snow.\n When the sun is out, regardless of below-zero temperatures, it\n\nunfolds its six petals to reveal a brilliant yellow center. \n\n  Hugging the earth, the croci\'s furry stems and flowers are\n\nvelvety to the touch, and their soft shiny petals are either pale purple,\n\nmauve, a very pale blue or white.\n They reflect the sun towards the flower\'s bright center, which is\n\nseveral degrees warmer than the surrounding air, offering a haven to spring\n\ninsects. \n\n  " You can explore the prairie with a guide or follow the\n\nself-guiding trail, but you\'ll probably find more if you just wander around\n\nalone,"  says Ball.   " In May you\'ll see lots of prairie\n\nbuttercups (  Ranunculus rhomboideus  ) , small in size but\n\nwith a big, bright, buttery yellow colour."   \n\n  June is called Wild Rose month at the Museum because of the abun\n\n<l> dance of low prairie roses (  Rosa arkansana  ) .\n The entire landscape becomes a sea of pink, red and white, all sway\n\n<l> ing to the call of meadowlarks and finches.\n\n\n  Rosa woodsii\n\n ) , and the prickly rose (  Rosa acicularis   ) , the low\n\nprairie rose rarely exceeds 12 inches ( 30 cm) in height.\n It is considered an endangered species in Canada and is not easily\n\ngrown from seed.\n The successful gardener, however, will be rewarded with\n\nplentiful blooms and a harvest of tasty rose hips for teas, jams and jellies.\n\n\n\n  Not all of the Museum\'s resident flowers are like the showy\n\nroses.\n Criss-crossing the site on a given day you are likely to encounter\n\nthe delicate bird-foot violet (  Viola pedatafida  ) snuggling\n\ndown to avoid the ever-present wind.\n Resembling a bird\'s foot, this blue violet is far hardier than many\n\nsuspect and is able to survive fire as well as drought. \n\n  Liliurn\n\nphiladelphicum  ) are unmistakable.\n Standing with their blooms just above the surrounding plants, they\n\nsometimes fall victim to the unscrupulous picker.\n The tiny, pale amethyst-coloured trumpets of the lilac bearded tongue\n\n(  Penstemon gracilis  ) don\'t seem to worry about pickers.\n They raise their blossoms up high for all to see, but you have to\n\nbend over and look carefully to find them. \n\n  June is also the time of year when the heady smell of the\n\nwolfwillow, or silverberry (  Elaeagnus commutata  ) flows across\n\nthe landscape.\n This shrub has yellow flowers that are so tiny they seem incapable of\n\nproducing such a heavy, sweet fragrance, but you only have to follow your\n\nnose for proof of its origin. \n\n  July and August are very quiet at the Museum.\n Temperatures of over 30&degree;C typify the prairie day in summer and\n\nkeep away all but the hardiest of explorers.\n But many still come, meandering happily, accompanied by the\n\nmusic of crickets and grasshoppers.  \n\n  " You get a terrific array of colour during the hottest\n\ndays.\n And plants are a lot taller - usually about a meter high by August,"\n\n says Ball, who walks the trails of the Museum once or twice a month.\n\n  " You\'ll find purples and golds mainly.\n\n\nand  P. purpureum  ) dot the site, looking a lot like little\n\ncattails."   \n\n \n\nand  L. punclata  ) appear as dirty, plum-coloured paint brushes.\n A variety of sunflowers with their sulphur yellows and tarnished\n\ngolds stretch just above their neighbours to take advantage of the wind\n\nand insects for pollination. \n\n  This is the time of year to find the blue-purple funnels and\n\noblong leaves of the small, elusive and late-blooming gentian (  Gentiana\n\naffinis  ) , which grows only to a height of ten inches ( 25 cm).\n With the rest of the prairie striving for the meter mark, it pays to\n\nask the naturalist for direction to the newest blooms. \n\n  ) ,\n\nsilver leaf psoralea (  Psoralea argophylla  ) and wolfwillow give\n\nthe prairie a hoary look in July, so much so that one area of the park is\n\ncalled Silver Heights.\n By August some of the more somber tones of the late summer flowers\n\nstand out against the subtle silvers.\n ) ,\n\nused to make Earl Grey tea, in bloom.\n The pink-purple fists of these flowers smell suspiciously of pizza,\n\nbut the crushed stem will yield the familiar smell of the oil that flavours\n\nthe tea. \n\n  While it may appear that there is little active management\n\nof the Museum, in the summer months three naturalists ( only one is kept on\n\nover the winter) and assorted volunteers are regularly at work struggling to\n\nmaintain the prairie given its location in the middle of the city. \n\n  People who come to the Museum in June are often shocked to see\n\nthe staff running about with brooms and rubber flappers, setting fires\n\nand guiding their course.\n Though it occasionally appears that a disaster is in progress, the\n\nopposite is true.  \n\n  " We burn about one-fifth of the prairie every year, much\n\nto the annoyance of the surrounding home owners."  says Neilsen.\n\n  " It\'s an annual event, complete with leaping flames and huge\n\nclouds of smoke."  \n Not a bad day\'s work for the staff and helpers, but a little daunting\n\nfor nearby residents, whose complaints and protests make managing the prairie\n\na constant controversy. \n\n  But the prairie must burn if it\'s to remain healthy.\n Fire is a natural part of prairie life; in fact, the plants have\n\nadapted to it and need it.\n Burning encourages the growth of native species and inhibits\n\nsuccession by forest species, most notably the trembling aspen (  Populus\n\ntremuloides  ) .\n It also allows seed to break dormancy and contributes to improving\n\nthe nutrient level in the soil. \n\n  The entire 30-acre site is weeded by hand.\n This back-breaking and tedious work is necessary to control the invad\n\n<l> ing weed species that spring up in the small disturbed areas, where paths\n\ncut across the site or ground has been broken either by accident or past\n\nagricultural activity. \n\n  " On occasion they use some of the local law-breakers,"\n\n says Ball.   " They work off their fines by pulling weeds.\n\n The primary species designated as weeds in the prairie are Canada\n\nthistle (  Cirsium arvense  ) , yellow sweet clover (  Melilotus\n\nofficinalis  ) and alfalfa ( Medicago sativa). \n\n  A unique Canadian heritage, the Living Prairie Museum is a\n\nnatural celebration of life and colour.\n With nearly 200 native species of plants and fauna living alongside\n\nthe monarch butterfly, western meadowlark, white-tailed jack rabbit and red\n\nfox, this museum provides a welcome contrast to the houses and highrises that\n\nencompass it.\n Ensuring its survival into the next century will require the strength\n\nof spirit and deep commitment of Canadian naturalists everywhere.\n\n\n An environmental biologist and past naturalist at the Living\n\nPrairie Museum, George R. Kynman works as a freelance environmental\n\njournalist in Manitoba.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Summer can be deadly for houseplants.\n With the sun high in the sky and the backyard beckoning,\n\ngardening and the other outdoor activities sometimes take precedence over\n\ntheir care.\n But now is hardly the time to leave your houseplants to their own\n\ndevices.\n During these hot months most plants ( some are dormant during\n\nthe summer) need more water and food and probably less light as temper <l>\n\natures and light increase. \n\n  Some plants do well on the same windowsill year after year, but\n\nothers need to be moved as the seasons change.\n When fall becomes winter, light duration and intensity drop, but as\n\nthe earth moves towards the sun in the spring light intensity and duration\n\nincrease.\n Many of your plants will respond to these changes; it\'s up to you to\n\ngage their response and attend to your plants accordingly. \n\n  Every day the sun rises in the east and sets in the west.\n To select the appropriate houseplant for any one of your windows,\n\nit\'s important to know which direction they face.\n The following is a description of the type of light to expect\n\nfrom each exposure and includes a list of the plants that will grow well\n\nthere. \n\n\n  There is no direct sun from a north-facing window, but the light\n\nis constant and cool.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '3e554d88-85fc-41d4-b591-8cdee9271f07', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.835764+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9522655606269836, 'non_english_score': 0.04773443937301636}
{'text': "Canadians are an odd and fortunate people.\n Odd because we spend the better part of every year alternately\n\nsteeling ourselves against the winter freeze and rushing out in a whirl of\n\nscarves and hats to embrace the pleasures of the frozen landscape. \n\n  Fortunate because every year spring follows winter with only\n\nslight irregularity.\n Invariably, ever warmer breezes, melting snow and mud lead to new\n\ngrowth.\n This renewal of life, however, is too often taken for granted, with\n\nlittle thought given to the consequences that even our most basic actions\n\nhave on our natural surroundings.\n As gardeners, we share the responsibility to contribute to the\n\nwell-being of the environment by choosing to work our gardens in a healthy\n\nmanner. \n\n  With the onslaught of green advertising from every sector of our\n\nconsumer society, organic gardening methods are undergoing an identity\n\ncrisis.\n In this issue, we've decided to try and put a couple of methods in\n\nperspective.\n Don Brenneman's report on fertilizers distinguishes between feeding\n\nyour plants and feeding your soil, and in no uncertain terms lets you know\n\nwhich is better for your garden.\n Ken Taylor provides fruit tree growers with a rundown of how and when\n\nto use dormant oil sprays to control pest problems. \n\n  Our feature article is bound to take some of the chill

enjoy, and what aspects of\n\ngardening in Canada you'd like to know more about. \n\n \n\n\n\n\nPhotograph \n\n Like harbingers of spring, a multitude of flowering plants become\n\navailable at this time of year.\n Many are popular a gifts, and all appeal to the plant lover looking\n\nfor a splash of colour or a new plant to care for indoors.\n The following six plants are given as gifts more often than any\n\nothers.\n Whether you're doing the buying or the receiving, it helps to know\n\nwhat to look for in the store and then how to care for your plant once it's\n\nsafely home. \n\n\nphoto Linda Link \n\n\n  Resembling daisies, the cheery cineraria is a profuse bloomer\n\nwhose flowers often completely cover the plant's foliage.\n The flowers come in a wide range of both pastel and brilliant\n\ncolours, in pinks, blues, purples and white, and will last up to three weeks.\n\n\n\n  Water your plant regularly; the mound of blossoms will wilt\n\nreadily if the soil is allowed to dry out.\n Cooler temperatures of 19 degrees C maximum and no direct sun will\n\nkeep cinerarias happy, and remember not to fertilize while they are in\n\nbloom.\n After flowering the leaves deteriorate rapidly.\n Because cinerarias are annuals and cannot be reflowered, they\n\nare usually discarded after blooming. \n\n  With patience, cinerarias can be grown from seed.\n Sow by summer and gradually pot up the individual plants.\n Flower bud initiation occurs during a three-to-four month period\n\nwhere night temperatures cannot exceed 16 degrees C.\n If you want to hasten flowering, give your plant long hours of light.\n Cinerarias and white flies seem to go together, so keep them isolated\n\nfrom your other plants. \n\n\n  Easter lilies are gift plants everyone loves; the\n\ntraditional flower for Easter is the pure white lily, while hybrid lilies in\n\nreds, oranges and yellows are marketed for Mother's Day.\n When buying, choose a plant with buds to make sure you will have a\n\nlong flowering period.\n Individual blooms will stay attractive for two or three weeks.\n\n\n\n  Place your plant in a bright, cool window and water only when the\n\nsoil begins to dry.\n Daytime temperatures of only 16 to 18 degrees C are preferred,\n\nand lilies will benefit by being moved to an even cooler spot at night.\n It is believed that removing the yellow pollen-bearing anthers from\n\nthe center of the flower will help the blooms last longer. \n\n  Cut off the flowers as they fade.\n Lilies can't be brought into bloom again indoors as they have already\n\nbeen forced to flower before their natural season, which is summer.\n Although lilies are perennial plants, they are unlikely to overwinter\n\nin most areas.\n Try keeping them in a bright area until they can be safely planted\n\ninto a sunny part of the garden where they may bloom again at summer's end\n\nwithout any special treatment. \n\n\n  For fragrance the gardenia is unsurpassed as an indoor bloomer.\n The flowers, which may last up to three weeks, give off a heavy\n\njasmine-like scent and their creamy-white colour contrasts beautifully\n\nwith the glossy, dark green leaves of this woody plant. \n\n  Gardenias are so fussy about temperature that they disappoint\n\nmany would-be growers.\n During the day keep these sun lovers in maximum light at 21 to 23\n\ndegrees C and at night, 16 to 17 degrees C.\n Warmer daytime temperatures will reduce the development of flower\n\nbuds and will encourage buds to drop, and cooler temperatures during the\n\nnight will cause leaves to yellow.\n Any sudden change in temperature, exposure to drafts or lack of\n\nhumidity will also cause the buds to drop. \n\n  To keep these plants healthy a very high humidity level, much\n\nhigher than is normal in most homes, is essential.\n Also, constant moisture and acid conditions are required.\n Mist your plant daily or place it on a humidity tray, water as\n\nneeded, then water monthly with an acid solution of ammonium sulphate (\n\none level teaspoon to one liter of water. \n\n  Gardenias must be in constant growth to be able to bloom freely.\n Feed routinely ( every two or three weeks) during active growth but\n\nnot during the winter months.\n If you meet the temperature and humidity requirements of your plant,\n\nyou will be rewarded with more flowers in the fall and then again in winter.\n\n\n\n  Hydrangeas can only be found around Easter and Mother's Day.\n The large, round flower clusters in pastel pink or blue that form at\n\nthe top of the plant's woody stems are long lasting, staying showy for one or\n\ntwo months.\n Easy to keep, hydrangeas require average temperature and\n\nhumidity and indirect, bright light.\n Constant moisture is a must, however, or your plant will deteriorate\n\nrapidly.\n Soil acidity is relatively neutral for pink blooms ( pH 6.2 to 6.5)\n\nwhile blue hydrangeas develop in more acidic conditions ( pH 4.5 to\n\n5.0). \n\n  If you're keeping your plant to reflower next year, prune it back\n\nwhen the flowers have dried up to just above the old wood and water and\n\nfertilize monthly throughout the summer.\n Buds will form when the plant is kept in a bright spot in\n\ntemperatures of below 18 degrees C for six weeks.\n Further development will occur over the next six weeks ( equal to the\n\nwinter dormancy period) if you keep your plant in continuous darkness at\n\ntemperatures of 5 to 7 degrees C.\n A cold but frost-free garage or cellar is suitable.\n Hydrangeas can then be brought into bright light and forced into\n\nbloom if kept at 16 degrees C at night and 18 to 21 degrees C during the day\n\nfor about three months. \n\n\n  This citrus plant is everbearing, meaning that it flowers and\n\nsets fruit all year long.\n Both the flowers, which are sweetly fragrant, and fruit, which can\n\ngrow up to 2 inches ( 5 cm) in diameter, can be on the plant at the same\n\ntime.\n The juicy, acidic fruit is edible and can be used in beverages or\n\nwhen making jam as a substitute for lemons and limes. \n\n  These upright, compact, slow-growing trees demand full sun;\n\nwithout it the foliage will drop and the formation of blossoms will be\n\nretarded.\n If sufficient light is not available, miniature oranges can be grown\n\nsuccessfully under fluorescent lights.\n Room temperatures and humidity should be average.\n A humus-like, acidic soil that is kept moist but never saturated is\n\nbest. \n\n  During periods of active growth be sure to supply a balanced\n\nall-purpose fertilizer.\n Spending the summer outside will give them a lift.\n If flowers fail to develop into fruit, pollinate them yourself using\n\na child's paintbrush by lifting the yellow pollen from the stamens ( the\n\nthread-like protrusions that are coated in pollen) of one blossom and\n\nbrushing it on top of the pistil ( the bulbous protruding part in the\n\nflower's center) of another.\n Transplant to a slightly larger pot only when necessary, when\n\nthe plant becomes pot bound and there is not enough soil to hold the water.\n\n\n\n\n  Miniature roses, which come in the complete range of rose\n\ncolours, are delightful for indoor plant culture.\n You'll find the largest selection available just before\n\nMother's Day.\n , which doesn't\n\nexceed one foot ( 30 cm) in height and bears single blooms that are half an\n\ninch to an inch ( 1 - 3 cm) across and leaves that are equally small, and the\n\ntaller  Rosa X polyantha  , which produces one- to two-inch ( 3 - 5\n\ncm) blooms in clusters.\n\n\n  If provided with maximum light miniature roses will flower\n\ncontinuously.\n If sufficient light can't be provided during the winter months,\n\nplace your plant in a cool or unheated well-lit room to give it a rest\n\nperiod.\n Miniatures are best suited to average to cool daytime temperatures\n\nand like a nighttime minimum of 10 to 13 degrees C.\n The soil, which should be kept moist but not wet, should contain\n\nsome humus and permit good drainage. \n\n  To encourage bushiness and more abundant winter blooming, put\n\nyour plant outdoors for the summer and water and fertilize regularly.\n Prune to a symmetrical shape in the fall and reduce watering\n\nuntil new growth appears.\n Occasional pruning of the flowering stem will encourage new bud for\n\n<l> mation.\n Side branches that don't bloom should also be pruned to prompt\n\nbranching.\n If your rose is well protected you can plant it permanently in\n\nthe garden. \n Jean Harris is an ornamental horticulturist and avid

undertaken significant theoretical studies\n\non the formation of stars and on the interstellar medium, which is the dif\n\n<l> fuse gas between stars.\n Recently he has concentrated on teaching and administration.\n He arrived at the university in 1968, has served on the Senate for\n\nmost of the past ten years, and is the current chair of the Senate Honorary\n\nDegrees Committee. \n\n  Dr. Jeremy Tatum and Dave Balam, a research assistant who has been\n\nat    University of Victoria   for 14 years, work\n\nas a team to observe asteroids ( which are referred to as minor planets),\n\ncomets and other bodies in space.\n\n\npositions and compute their orbits.\n This aspect of the discipline is called astrometry, and Tatum\n\nsays that Balam is \x93one of the finest astrometrists that Canada has ever pro\n\n<l> duced.\x94 \n\n  Tatum and Balam form one of only about eighteen observing teams in\n\nthe world, and there are even fewer orbital computing teams, Balam says.\n Usually the two functions are performed by distinct groups, but\n\nthe    University of Victoria   duo is diver <l>\n\nsified enough to do both. \n\n  Tatum and Balam have several tasks, one of the most significant\n\nof which is observing minor planets which have been provisionally numbered by\n\nthe international Minor Planet Center.\n Tatum and Balam calculate precision orbits so that the objects may be\n\npermanently numbered.\n They also obtain precise positions of short period comets.\n The most timely of their objectives is to provide rapid astrometry\n\nfor newly-discovered comets and unusual asteroids in response to\n\ntelegrams from the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams of the\n\nInternational Astronomical Union in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n They are often able to provide this information within a few hours of\n\nreceiving a telegram. \n\n  \x93The main emphasis in the study of the solar system is on what\n\nthings are, but first you have to know where they are,\x94 Balam says.\n\n\n  A central irony in the discipline is captured by Balam when he\n\nsays, \x93Over the years, I have seen only three of the things I have worked\n\nwith: comet Halley and two others.\x94\n While many astronomers are drawn to the field by their love of\n\nlooking at the stars, like John Climenhaga, once they enter the field as\n\nprofessionals their major contact with stellar objects is by looking at pho\n\n<l> tographic plates or CCD-generated images.\n Even for people who are primarily observers, computations are\n\nmuch more a part of their daily astronomical routine than staring into space.\n\n\n\n  That romantic notion of astronomy is not lost completely,\n\nhowever.\n University\n\nof Victoria   Buildings and Grounds, is one of the world\x92s foremost\n\namateur astronomers.\n He carries his eight-inch Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope around with\n\nhim, and \x93can\x92t pass by a clear night without looking at something.\x94\n Most clear evenings Spratt, who lives in a condominium that does\n\nnot afford good viewing, will drive to Cattle Point or a friend\x92s house\n\nand observe for two to three hours.\n He says that September through October and March through April are\n\nthe best times of year for visual observations. \n\n  Spratt also works in conjunction with Balam and Tatum.\n He receives the coordinates of a comet from them, then is able\n\nto locate it with his telescope.\n He gathers information, especially on new comets, and enters it into\n\na computer at home.\n Spratt is able to measure the

verge of\n\nbursting into flames when he pulls it out of the ray.\n He then shows guests the inside of the dome and explains the\n\noperation of the main telescope; if Venus or some other body is visible on\n\nthe day of the tour, he will focus the telescope on it to give the guests an\n\nextra treat. \n\n  Humans have always been fascinated by the sky and what lies\n\nbeyond our

flower\n\nand lean towards a light source, move them to an east window where they will\n\nget more light.\n Plants in a north window in the summer may have to be moved to a\n\nbrighter location in the winter. \n\n\n  Many plants benefit from the cool morning sun that radiates\n\nthrough an east-facing window.\n Eaves and overhangs lessen the duration of direct sun from this\n\nexposure.\n If you are unsure about a plant\x92s light requirements, an east window\n\nis a safe bet.\n It receives up to four hours of sun per day, which many flowering\n\nplants appreciate. \n\n\n  The seasonal variation in light from the south is greater than\n\nany other exposure.\n In the summer, bright, direct light fills the room and is at its most\n\nintense at midday.\n Tropical flowering plants, cacti and succulents do well in this\n\nwindow. \n\n\n  Even though the sun is not at its highest in this window, it is\n\nat its hottest for four hours in the afternoon.\n Cacti, succulents and some tropical foliage plants do well here.\n West-facing windows are not always hot because elevation and latitude\n\nplay an important role in light intensity, which is higher in the mountains,\n\nwhere the air is thinner, than at sea level. \n\n  Many tropical flowering plants do well with a western exposure\n\nduring the summer.\n If possible, cacti and succulents should be moved to a window\n\nthat faces south in the winter. \n\n\n  Many hanging plants may suffer from too little light even when\n\nplaced in a bright, sunny window.\n When ceilings are high and windows are low the plant dangles\n\nabove the light.\n To rectify this, attach brackets to the wall beside the window\n\nand hang the plant there, tie a rope to the hanger to lengthen it or select\n\nplants that need less light. \n\n\n  Many people have skylights in their homes, which add extra light\n\nfor plants to grow.\n How big the skylight is and how far it is from the ceiling of the\n\nroom to the top of the skylight determines the type of plant that should\n\nbe placed there. \n\n  Some openings are over six feet ( 2 m) from the ceiling to the\n\nroof of the house, which allows for limited light.\n To grow plants up the shaft is an appealing idea but it\x92s hard to\n\nmaintain the plants.\n Note the hours of direct sun and the intensity of light the skylight\n\nreceives and select plants accordingly.  \n\n\n\n  Ronald Worton, geneticist-in-chief at Toronto\x92s\n\nHospital for Sick Children, said that, until recently, various organizations\n\nthat fund Canadian scientific studies, including the National Research\n\nCouncil, the Medical Research Council ( MRC) and the Natural Sciences and\n\nEngineering Research Council ( NSERC), have as yet been unable to agree on\n\nwhich agency should provide the money, or where the money will come from.\n One problem is that agencies want specific research proposals, which\n\nscientists say they need money to provide.\n Said Worton: \x93It\x92s a fairly complex undertaking that can\x92t be\n\npresented as a regular research proposal, or funded from the existing pot.\n\n\n  The global project that Canadian scientists want to join is aimed\n\nat producing, by the early 21st century, a complete so-called map, actually a\n\nhuge chart, showing the exact molecular sequence of about 100,000 genes, the\n\ngenetic code-carrying units that are embedded in the deoxyribonucleic acid,\n\nor DNA, that makes up the core of human cells.\n Each gene contains part of the overall genetic blueprint that\n\ndetermines the physical makeup of all forms of life.\n The information is encoded in combinations of four chemical \x93bases,\x94\n\nas scientists call them \x96 adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine.\n Each piece of genetic information directs cells to produce proteins\n\nthat determine everything from the height of a man and the color of his hair,\n\nto the shape of a woman\x92s foot and her tendency to develop certain illnesses.\n , a total of three billion DNA bases are involved in\n\ndetermining human characteristics. \n\n  The project that involves charting each of the bases and the\n\ngenes they make up, so that doctors will some day know exactly which gene is\n\nresponsible for every function of the human body, is the first comprehensive\n\nproject to embrace the science of molecular biology.\n The brainchild of Robert Sinsheimer, then chancellor of the\n\nUniversity of California at Santa Cruz, the idea attracted the attention in\n\n1986 of James Watson, the American biologist who, with British biologist\n\nFrancis Crick, discovered the molecular structure of the DNA molecule in\n\n1953.\n In 1988, the Bethesda, Md.-based U.S. National Institutes of Health (\n\nNIH) established an office of human genome research, led by Watson, to\n\nco-ordinate American efforts to map the genome. \n\n  Despite the delay in establishing a Canadian contribution to the\n\nproject, Canada is a highly regarded participant in genetic research.\n Last August, doctors at Toronto\x92s Hospital for Sick Children located\n\nthe gene responsible for cystic fibrosis, a fatal disorder that affects one\n\nin every 2,000 children and causes excess mucus to clog the lungs and\n\ndigestive system.\n The team leader was Dr. Lap-Chee Tsui, who says a complete genome map\n\nwould have allowed the discovery to take place three years earlier.\n \x93Right now, scientists have to start locating genes again with each\n\nnew project,\x94 he said.\n Tsui and other supporters say the proposed computerized map would\n\neliminate that need, increasing scientific efficiency and enabling small labs\n\nto work in complex genetics. \n\n  The same hospital\x92s Worton is a member of the executive of the\n\nHuman Genome Organization, a Geneva-based group of about 250 scientists from\n\ntwo dozen countries that was set up last year to promote international\n\ncollaboration in the genome effort.\n Said Worton: \x93Canada is a world leader, so people will naturally ask\n\nwhy we\x92re dragging our feet on a project that will have huge payoffs for the\n\npublic and industry.\x94\n Last October, Worton helped to write a general proposal for Canadian\n\ngenome research, which called for grants from Ottawa of between\n\n$25 million and\n\n$50 million during the next five years.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL',

{'text': 'Tinkering with the stuff of life, scientists are on the edge of\n\nengineering cures for the deadliest diseases of our time \n Article by MARK WITTEN\n\n  AT 8 O\'CLOCK ON THE MORNING OF June 5, 1992, DENISE ROCHEAU, A\n\n28-YEAR-OLD QUEBEC CITY woman, was wheeled into an operating room at the\n\nUniversity of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor.\n A heavy black mask was placed over her nose and mouth, and taking\n\ndirection, she began inhaling deep drafts of an anaesthetic.\n Waiting for the patient to lose consciousness, a team of about a dozen\n\nmedical experts, briefed to the final detail, made a last inspection of\n\nthe high-tech apparatus scattered around the room.\n Off to the side, the team\'s leader, Jim Wilson, a tall, boyish-looking\n\ndoctor, watched intently. \n\n  A mother who worked as a seam-stress and part-time bank teller,\n\nDenise ( a pseudonym to conceal her identity) suffered from a deadly\n\ninherited heart disorder called familial hypercholesterolaemia ( FH).\n FH is caused by the lack of an essential gene in the liver that helps\n\nremove " bad" cholesterol - the type that sticks to artery walls and\n\nclogs blood vessels - from the bloodstream.\n The disease had already killed two of her brothers and had been\n\nresponsible for her heart attack at the age of 16.\n Either with great faith or in great desperation, Denise agreed to be\n\na human guinea pig in a medical fantasy now being brought to life by gene\n\ntherapist Jim Wilson.\n She was gambling that Wilson and his team could safely treat the\n\ndisease by replacing her fatally flawed genes with new ones.\n Failure could cost Denise her life.\n Success would usher in a revolution in modern medicine more sweeping\n\nthan the discovery of vaccines or antibiotics. \n\n  With clinical precision, lead surgeon Steve Raper dragged\n\nhis scalpel across Denise\'s skin just below the rib cage, producing a crimson\n\nstreak.\n Raper then cut through layers of abdominal tissue until he\n\nreached his target, Denise\'s liver.\n He paused, probed for a lobe of the vital organ, and cut away a\n\n255-gram section while the assisting surgeon hastened to stop the\n\nbleeding.\n To the naked eye, there was nothing to suggest that this hand-sized\n\nslab of pinkish brown tissue harboured a fatal genetic defect that caused De\n\n<l> nise to have cholesterol levels three times greater than normal.\n The severed lobe hung from a pair of forceps and then dropped into a\n\nplastic bag that rested in a basin filled with ice.\n Wilson grabbed the container, tucked it under his arm like a\n\nfootball, and rushed to a laboratory where his colleague, Mariann\n\nGrossman, was ready to begin the exacting process of inserting healthy genes\n\ninto the patient\'s liver. \n\n  It would take four intense days of activity in the medical\n\ncentre\'s laboratories, operating room, and intensive-care unit before\n\nthe gene-therapy procedure was completed, and several months more before\n\nWilson was certain that the new genes were bringing about a lasting\n\nimprovement in Denise\'s cholesterol levels.\n Early this spring, nearly two years after the operation, Wilson,\n\nGrossman, and their gene-therapy team made medical history when they\n\npublished the results of the experiment in the scientific journal \n\nNature Genetics  .\n Their landmark report, which made front-page headlines around\n\nthe world, was the first to show the lasting therapeutic benefits of gene\n\ntherapy for a patient with a life-threatening inherited disease. \n\n  Wilson was able to report that Denise\'s harmful-cholesterol\n\nlevels had dropped by almost 20 percent after gene therapy and that the level\n\nof " good" cholesterol was raised significantly.\n She was administered a cholesterol-lowering drug, which had not\n\nworked prior to the treatment, and her harmful cholesterol dropped by about\n\n30 percent overall from pre-treatment levels, although it still remained\n\nat more than twice normal levels.\n The most encouraging news, however, was that her cholesterol had\n\nremained low for the full 28 months since she had received the treatment.\n Since Denise\'s operation, four other FH patients have undergone\n\nWilson\'s experimental gene therapy: a 12-year-old boy from Cyprus, an\n\n8-year-old girl from Colombia, an 11-year-old girl from China, and a\n\n41-year-old woman from Quebec.\n The results of these treatments should be known by the end of 1994.\n\n\n\n  " We\'ve demonstrated the long-term safety and\n\neffectiveness of gene therapy in this patient,"  says Wilson. \n\n " By doing so, we have opened the doors for the potential of gene\n\ntherapy in treating various forms of inherited lethal disorders.\n I believe that gene therapy will become a part of every medical\n\ndiscipline."   \n\n  At 39, Jim Wilson is in the vanguard of a generation of\n\nscientists whose ability to manipulate and reconstruct DNA in the labora <l>\n\ntory gives them the power to alter the genetic makeup of people.\n In biological terms, gene therapy uses DNA information technology to\n\nre-program human cells in the hope of correcting critical genetic-coding er\n\n<l> rors.\n A few years ago, the idea of using gene therapy to treat patients\n\nwith life-threatening diseases was an exciting but only theoretical\n\npossibility.\n Today, gene therapy is one of the hottest areas of medical research.\n More than 70 clinical trials are under way in the United States,\n\nGreat Britain, Italy, and China, and a number of tests are being planned\n\nacross Canada.\n Trials include Wilson\'s treatment of five FH patients and a\n\nsecond major test in which he plans to treat 22 patients with cystic fibrosis\n\n( CF), the most common genetic disease among Caucasians. \n\n  Gene therapy excites medical researchers because, in theory,\n\nit offers a way to treat the root cause of any inherited disease,\n\nincluding many fatal illnesses for which there is currently no effective\n\ntreatment or cure.\n Instead of treating the symptoms that result from a genetic defect,\n\ngene therapy seeks to correct the problem at the source and, in this way,\n\nprovide a lasting cure. \n Gene therapy offers new hope in the seemingly one-sided battle\n\nagainst some 4,000 inherited diseases that are known to result from a\n\ndefective single gene.\n The better-known ones include muscular dystrophy, CF,\n\nsickle-cell anaemia, Tay-Sachs disease, and amyotrophic lateral scle <l>\n\nrosis ( Lou Gehrig\'s disease). \n\n  The potential applications of gene therapy go far beyond\n\nsingle-gene disorders.\n Genetic defects are also known or suspected to play a role in\n\nsociety\'s most common and deadliest diseases, including many types of cancer,\n\nAlzheimer\'s disease, haemophilia, and diabetes.\n In many instances, the underlying genetic basis of the illness\n\nis not yet understood and may involve a complex interaction of several genes.\n As the processes become known, researchers hope that gene\n\ntherapy will help correct the conditions. \n\n  But for all its huge promise, human gene therapy has been thin on\n\nhard clinical data to show that it works.\n Scientists such as 57-year-old French Anderson, who led the first\n\ngovernment-approved human gene-therapy trial four years ago, have been theo\n\n<l> rizing about it since the late 1960s.\n The New\n\nEngland Journal of Medicine  , where it was rejected after a heated\n\ndebate. \n\n  Why did it take 25 years before Jim Wilson could successfully\n\napply the concept of gene therapy for the first time?\n In theory, the idea is simple: Just insert a healthy gene to do the\n\nwork of a defective gene.\n In reality, gene therapy is anything but simple.\n First, scientists must find and clone the right gene among a\n\nhundred thousand others packed into the DNA in each human cell.\n Second, they must be able to deliver the right genes safely into the\n\nright target cells, in either the bloodstream, liver, lung, or brain.\n Then they must get the transplanted genes to work properly in order\n\nto correct the biochemical breakdown that causes the disease. \n\n  Finding a gene is enormously difficult.\n As the basic units of heredity, genes are segments of DNA in the nu\n\n<l> cleus of each cell that contain instructions to make proteins, the\n\nbasic building blocks of life.\n The famous DNA double helix is a winding molecular ladder three\n\nbillion rungs long.\n A specific gene can be a segment of DNA that is as short as a\n\nthousand rungs or as long as several hundred thousand rungs.\n Gene hunter Francis Collins likes to observe that locating a gene is\n\nmuch harder than finding a needle in a haystack.\n The needle stands out because it looks different, but a gene is\n\njust another piece of DNA. \n\n  Until the 1980s, only a few of the genes that cause single-gene\n\ndisorders had been cloned.\n These included the adenosine deaminase ( ADA) gene that causes severe\n\ncombined immune deficiency ( SCID); the gene that causes Lesch-Nyhan\n\nsyndrome, a rare degenerative disease of the nervous system; and\n\nthe beta globin gene that causes thalassaemia, a deadly blood disorder common\n\namong Mediterranean peoples. \n\n  At first, each of these diseases was considered a potential\n\ncandidate for human gene therapy.\n The idea was so tantalizing that Martin Cline, a brilliant and\n\nambitious California scientist, conducted a rogue experimental gene-therapy\n\ntrial in the summer of 1980.\n Cline, who had been denied permission to conduct human trials in the\n\nUnited States, secretly flew to Israel and Italy, where he inserted beta\n\nglobin genes into two young women afflicted with thalassaemia.\n\n\nview committee about the methods he was using.\n The research superstar lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in\n\ngrants after U.S. funding authorities found out about the tests. \n\n  The Cline fiasco highlighted both the severe technical\n\nlimitations of gene therapy at the time and the need for a new government\n\nregulatory body to review the technical and ethical merits of any\n\nproposed human gene-therapy trials in the future. In 1980, scientists had not\n\ncloned many genes, nor had they developed effective methods for\n\ntransferring genes into human cells and getting those genes to work.\n The technical hurdles were so great that in 1981, French Anderson,\n\none of gene therapy\'s strongest proponents, abandoned research for\n\nseveral years.\n With Anderson temporarily out of the field, Richard Mulligan, a\n\nyoung researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT) in\n\nBoston, filled the void.  \n He showed that specialized retroviruses could perform the critical\n\njob of delivering genes into animal and then human cells and getting the\n\ngenes to work.\n The retroviruses, really bundles of genes and proteins, act like\n\nmolecular delivery vans that attach to a target cell and then insert the\n\nhealthy gene that they carry into the DNA of the host cell.\n In Mulligan\'s laboratory, genetically engineered mouse leukemia\n\nretroviruses successfully delivered human genes into mouse DNA.\n\n\n  In the fall of 1990, French Anderson, Michael Blaese, and\n\nKenneth Culver at the National Institutes of Health ( NIH) in Bethesda,\n\nMaryland, performed the first human gene-therapy trial when they treated\n\ntwo girls with SCID.\n The girls were born with a mutant chromosone that kept them from\n\nproducing the ADA enzyme.\n Without the enzyme, the body cannot produce new T-cells ( a type\n\nof white blood cell) to fight disease, leaving the children defenceless\n\nagainst infection.\n In a widely publicized experiment, the NIH team used genetically\n\nengineered retroviruses to put normal ADA genes into the \n\ndeficient T-cells.\n\n\ning enough ADA to boost their immune systems.\n Four years after the initial treatments, the first gene-therapy\n\ntrial remains controversial because no scientific paper has been published\n\nshowing the trial\'s results. \n\n  Scientists were just learning how to manipulate genes when Wilson\n\nentered the University of Michigan\'s M.D./Ph.D. program in 1978, but it\n\nwas an area that fascinated him.\n As part of his research with geneticist Bill Kelley, Wilson helped\n\ndiscover the genetic flaw that causes Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, a devastating\n\ninherited disease that leads to mental retardation and compulsive\n\nself-mutilation in boys.\n Wilson vividly recalls how excited and happy he was when he told\n\nfamilies whose children had Lesch-Nyhan about his discovery of the mu <l>\n\ntant gene, only to be greeted with disappointment from one mother:\n\n " She didn\'t respond.\n "\n\n\n\n To treat Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, gene therapists must overcome the huge\n\nobstacle of effectively delivering genes into brain cells.\n The incident brought home to Wilson very early in his career the\n\nhuge gap between finding and fixing a gene. \n\n  During the 1980s, Wilson eagerly followed the viral-engineering\n\nbreak-throughs of Richard Mulligan.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '11643e6b-d609-40a9-9258-b67317344a64', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.840025+00:00', 'english_score': 0.965017557144165, 'non_english_score': 0.03498244285583496}
{'text': 'The cry of the loon is a symbol of the Canadian wilderness.\n The less we hear it, the more it tells us about the declining state of\n\nour mutual home. \n Essay by JEFF FAIR\n\n  AT NOON ON A DAY IN LATE May, I drive my little skiff into the\n\nnorthernmost bay of Aziscohos Lake, a hydroelectric reservoir not far\n\nfrom the Quebec border in western Maine.\n Right on schedule: I have spent half the day wandering along the\n\nwestern shoreline, spying on loon pairs and recording evidence of\n\nnesting, and will spend the remainder floating leisurely back down the\n\neast side with an eye out for my charges.\n\n\n  For 11 years, I was employed by the Audubon Society of New\n\nHampshire as chief biologist and philosopher of its loon-recovery project.\n Now I work directly for the loons and am paid for my efforts largely\n\nby power companies, which are inspired by the Federal Energy Regulatory Com\n\n<l> mission in Washington, D.C., to worry about how water-level changes on\n\ntheir impounded lakes affect the resident loons and their reproductive\n\nsuccess.\n Consultant seems too formal, too brassy a title.\n\n\n  This large bay is the territory belonging to and protected by a\n\npair of loons that I\'ve known for eight years as the Little Magalloway\n\nPair.\n They are fishing out in the middle when I arrive.\n I motor off to a far corner with a view of the entire territory, sun\n\nat my back, and shut off the outboard.\n Through binoculars, I watch them diving.\n They alternate, each dive lasting less than a minute.\n I suspect that eventually one of them will move toward their\n\nnest.\n Ten minutes into the program, as if by coincidence, the two dive\n\ntogether.\n A full minute passes.\n Two, three, Five.\n Under these conditions - lightly overcast sky, calm water the colour\n\nof wet concrete - a child could spot the black periscope-like head of a loon\n\nfrom a kilometre away. \n\n  I see nothing.\n I pour a cup of coffee from my thermos, eat my sandwich.\n Still nothing.\n I pour more coffee, finish lunch, all the while watching.\n Half an hour later, I still have not seen them.\n\n\n  Pretty crafty.\n But not surprising.\n Much of our attraction to the loon, after all, derives from its\n\nclandestine behaviours.\n Nothing like a taste of the unknown, the mysterious, to haunt the\n\nhuman mind with intrigue and inspire it toward romance.\n However, there is a dark side to our romance with the loon.\n These days, many of us feel a powerful and unrequited longing\n\nfor this wild spirit on lakes from which it has disappeared completely,\n\nchased off by human meddling or poisoned out by toxins we have dealt upon the\n\nlandscape.\n But this loss only inspires a greater affection: across Canada, a\n\nlarge network of vigilantes now monitors and fosters the loon\'s\n\nsurvival.\n\n\n  " Canadians have a historical gravitation toward loons,"\n\n a paddler in the outback of Ontario once explained to me. \n\n " Our national expansion was along waterways, by canoe.\n\n\npicture  \n\n  And exactly what is it about the call of the loon, I asked.\n " There\'s a certain piercing, haunting quality that tells you\n\nthere is still life out there,"  he said. \n\n " Sometimes there\'s something ... almost\n\nhuman to it."   \n\n  Gavia immer\n\n , provincial bird of Ontario, or  huart &agrave; collier  (\n\n " cry in a necklace"  ) to French Canadians.\n Three to seven kilograms of gristle, dance, fish oil, feather, web,\n\nwail, and deception.\n Not to be confused with the little red-throated loon of ponds along\n\nthe subarctic coast and on the tundra, the Pacific loon of larger,\n\ndeeper lakes of northern Canada west of Hudson Bay, or the yellow-billed loon\n\nof the far north. \n\n  The common loon nests on lakes and ponds throughout the boreal\n\nforest across North America.\n In Canada, its heartland, it numbers between a quarter- and a\n\nhalf-million birds.\n Its beauty is one more part of its allure.\n Sexes are similar, their backs and sides spangled white on a\n\nfield of black and otherwise adorned with two necklaces of legendary origin,\n\none black dagger of a beak, glowing white breast, and eyes redder than rubies\n\nset in a black head, sleek as satin, known by aficionados to reflect dark\n\niridescent green when seen up close under a particular angle of sunlight.\n Every part has its purpose - even the gaudy chessboard back serves as\n\ncamouflage on sun-dappled water or on the nest under the stippled shadows of\n\nwillow or blueberry. \n\n  The ecologist\'s eye discerns yet a different kind of beauty, that\n\nof a superbly designed organism engineered, in this case, to catch fish.\n The graceful shape allows torpedolike speed under water, powered by\n\ntwo huge feet set as far aft as possible for optimal leverage.  \n The loon\'s bones are solid and heavy; by flattening its feathers to\n\nremove interstitial air, a loon can make itself heavier than water and sink\n\nvertically.\n Though their pulmonary air capacity may last only a few minutes,\n\nloons have been captured in fish traps 60 metres down. \n\n  The loon pays in trade-offs for these specialties.\n Because its feet are set so far back on its heavy body, it moves awk\n\n<l> wardly on land.\n It builds its nest at the Water\'s edge, therefore, and can gain\n\nflight only from a liquid runway.\n\n\n  And to good avail: a loon can slip beneath the surface of a\n\nlarge, quiet lake on a clear day and disappear forever.\n How does it do it?\n At some indeterminable distance and direction, the escaping loon\n\nraises just its bill above the surface, grabs a quick breath, and\n\nresubmerges, leaving not a ripple.\n I saw it once, by luck, through my cheap Sears 7 x 35 extrawide-angle\n\nfield glasses.\n A series of these fast-snorkeled breaths allows a loon to put\n\nkilometres between itself and the dumbfounded human observer. \n\n  More alluring than its physical beauty is the cry of the loon,\n\nlorn and lonely, reaching you as you stand on shore under a wine-coloured\n\nsky, feeling much the same.\n A single wail at first.\n Then another, followed by yet others, excitement growing, blending\n\ninto a chorus of laughter and shrieking until the night is redundant with an\n\n<l> cient emotion. \n\n  Acoustic biologists have identified four distinctly meaningful\n\ncalls: the hoot ( a quiet contact call uttered among individuals close\n\ntogether), the wail (  " Where    are  \n\nyou? ... Come    here   "  ) , the\n\ntremolo ( a quavering cry signifying alarm), and the yodel ( most radically\n\ninsane of all, given by males to establish territory or express extreme\n\nalarm, as when a chick is threatened). \n\n  In native legends across Canada, the loon\'s calls forewarned of\n\nstorms or presaged the resurrection of a human soul.\n They were calls between lovers, for the return of a companion, of joy\n\nat being awarded those lovely necklaces in return for restoring sight to\n\na blind human.\n Ojibwa warriors heard promise of victory.\n Cree heard the voices of their dead.\n Our cold-hearted behavioural scientists postulate that the wild\n\nnighttime choruses are a function of territorial behaviour.\n Perhaps so.\n But why not consider deeper emotions?\n Joy?\n Celebration?\n\n\n  Through the season, I drop in on the Little Magalloway Pair,\n\nwatching for the sequence of behaviours typical of nesting loons.\n Shortly after ice-out, the male arrives to establish the\n\nterritory with song and dance.\n Then the female comes, and the two remain on the lake, often close\n\ntogether, after the migrants pass through.\n In late May or early June, you begin to notice only one bird at a\n\ntime.\n If you are lucky, you may hear a solitary wail and see a second bird\n\narrive just before the first disappears to take its shift at incubation. \n\n  But I do not see this sequence with the Little Magalloway\n\nPair.\n Instead, I observe two birds - when I see them at all - out on the\n\nwater together.\n In an endearing tableau,\n\nyoung loon chicks nestle in the feathers of their parent\'s back, enjoying\n\ngreat warmth and keeping a safe distance from aquatic predators such as\n\nsnapping turtle and northern pike \n No nest, no eggs at any of their traditional nesting sites.\n I\'ve seen it before.\n Even the most productive pairs take a year off from family\n\nresponsibilities once in a while, primarily to aggravate the local loon\n\nbiologist. \n\n  In early September, I am showing off my study area to a loon\n\nbiologist from Alaska, attempting to appear proficient at my trade.\n When we reach the Little Magalloway territory, I explain that\n\nthis pair has failed to nest this year.\n says my companion, peering through\n\nher binoculars. \n\n I take a look.\n\n\n  This was all two years ago, and I never did find the nest.\n Not that I needed to.\n As my Alaskan friend pointed out, a chick is a fairly strong\n\nindication that an egg had been laid.\n Nor did I mind the subterfuge.\n I had studied loons for only 16 years at the time.\n Had a lot to learn.\n Still do.\n No one knows, for example, which loons occupy which portions of\n\ntheir broad winter range, whether young adults return to their natal\n\nareas, why some lakes that offer apparently good loon habitat remain\n\nvacant, or how many chicks a loon pair must raise in a lifetime in order to\n\nbalance attrition.\n For decades, we believed that loon pairs fiercely maintained\n\nfidelity toward both mate and territory.\n Then a young biologist, Dave Evers, working out of Whitefish Point\n\nBird Observatory on Lake Superior, fashioned a technique for catching\n\nloons to colour-band them so that individuals could be recognized.\n Early results indicate that at least one-fifth of his banded birds\n\nswitch mates or sneak onto other territories each year.\n One wonders what else remains veiled in the loon\'s mystique.\n\n\n\n  The common loon may live to be 25 or 30 years old.\n Typical of long-lived birds, the loon lays a small clutch -\n\nnearly always two eggs - and gives its young full care through the summer.\n Both mates participate in everything but egg laying.\n A loon may ride the young on its back or disappear with them after\n\nhatching.\n But the mystical nature of this creature does not always work in its\n\nfavour.\n Loons will dance and sing in the summer twilight, year after year,\n\ninforming the night and our dreams with their presence while never re <l>\n\nvealing a chronic failure in reproduction.\n Until one spring, in their absence, there reigns an empty and\n\nterrible silence. \n\n  Is it possible that the common loon, this stable creature with\n\n60 million years of evolutionary fine-tuning, signature voice and spirit of\n\nCanada\'s wilds, symbol of this vast and haunting land that the entire\n\ncontinent once thought was inviolable, is disappearing from its haunts? \n\n  "\n\na vast uninhabited solitude"  by 19th-century naturalist Charles\n\nFathergill had suffered enough human habits and habitation to turn away its\n\nnative loon population.\n This prompted the Long Point Bird Observatory in Port Rowan to form\n\nits Ontario Lakes Loon Survey, later to become the nationwide Canadian Lakes\n\nLoon Survey, now under the direction of biologist Harry Vogel and\n\nempowered by 3,500 volunteers from Nova Scotia to the Yukon.\n The survey records the presence and breeding success of loons from\n\n reports and provides information to the public.\n I asked Vogel about the status of the loon in Ontario.\n The southern edge of its breeding range is still receding, he told\n\nme.\n Why?\n\n\n  Not the mere presence of humans but the behaviour of our modern\n\nmonoculture - the incredible busy-ness we inflict upon our public\n\nwaters.\n Not only is loon habitat lost to shoreline development, but nesting\n\nsites are disturbed - by berry pickers, picnickers, part-time naturalists,\n\ncanoeists and rowboaters, clandestine lovers, anglers, and campers - fre <l>\n\nquently enough to frighten the loons off their clutch of eggs and dissuade\n\nthem from returning.\n Similar human blunders separate adult loons from their chicks,\n\nleaving the little ones susceptible to predation or eventual starvation. \n\n  Dieter Schoenfeld is a charter volunteer member of the Loon\n\nSurvey who with his wife, Marlies, monitors loon populations and reproduction\n\non 10 lakes in the Sudbury area, including McFarlane, on which they live.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'c986a55f-b9b8-482b-89a5-3a8cc5229544', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.841526+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9551941752433777, 'non_english_score': 0.044805824756622314}
{'text': 'Almost 60 million of the majestic animals once roamed the forests\n\nand flatlands of North America.\n But European settlers brought a brutal end to that era when they\n\nkilled off nearly all of the continent\'s bison.\n By 1885, fewer than 1,000 remained.\n Now, the world\'s largest free-ranging herd consists of an estimated\n\n4,000 bison ( the animals are widely, but erroneously, referred to as\n\nbuffalo) that live under federal protection in northern Alberta.\n But until last week, when federal cabinet ministers intervened with a\n\npromise to look for alternatives, the bison seemed destined for mass\n\nslaughter.\n The drastic measure was proposed by a federally appointed panel that\n\nsaid that many of the bison are dangerously diseased. \n\n  The recommendation to systematically exterminate the entire herd\n\nin Wood Buffalo National Park created a storm of controversy over Canadian\n\nwildlife policy.\n If, as the Aug. 29 federal report said, at least half of the bison are\n\ncarrying tuberculosis or brucellosis ( a disease that causes pregnant bison\n\nto abort), they might infect other wild bison.\n Also at risk are domestic cattle, which come into contact with bison\n\nthat often wander outside the park.\n Brucellosis spreads when animals graze in pastures contaminated by\n\nthe afterbirth of ailing female bison.\n Tuberculosis can spread to other animals by airborne contact or\n\nthrough tainted water.\n Agriculture officials said that the epidemic could arouse U.S.\n\nsuspicions about Canadian beef, forcing Ottawa to spend millions of dollars\n\non inspection tests. \n\n  As a result, some federal officials say that the bison should be\n\nslaughtered.\n But the proposal led to widespread protests by naturalists and native\n\ngroups, who claimed that there was not sufficient proof of widespread illness\n\namong the animals.\n As the controversy deepened, Environment Minister Robert de Cotret\n\ncame to the  rescue.\n " I don\'t think the solution is to go out and shoot,"\n\n said de Cotret after meeting with native groups in Edmonton. \n " What we want is a healthy herd, and there are other ways\n\nto get that."   \n\n  Still, some wildlife experts contend that extermination is the\n\nbest way to prevent the contamination of other herds.\n The scientists say that tuberculosis and brucellosis are difficult to\n\ndetect, and can lie dormant for years.\n They also claim that rampant disease ( according to some estimates,\n\nas many as 80 per cent of the bison are infected) has helped to reduce the\n\nherd to fewer than 4,000 from more than 12,000 a few decades ago.\n Said Stacy Tessaro, a veterinary research scientist with Agriculture\n\nCanada in Saskatoon:  " It comes down to emotion versus scientific\n\nassessments.\n Nobody wants to destroy an animal, but we have no vaccine and no way\n\nto cure it."  \n\n  To bolster their arguments, agriculture experts point to a\n\nsimilar epidemic of tuberculosis among water buffalo in northern Australia.\n Officials had 7,000 infected animals killed in about 146 square miles\n\nof dense jungle between 1983 and 1985.\n " Complete depopulation was cheaper and a lot less painful to\n\nthe animals,"  said William Bulmer, the Ottawa-based director of\n\nanimal health for Agriculture Canada. \n " Thorough management will solve the problem, whereas\n\ninaction could mean the extinction of wood buffalo."   \n\n  For their part, defenders of the bison say that no one really\n\nknows how many animals are infected by disease.\n Opponents of the proposed slaughter include some Alberta-based\n\nemployees at Parks Canada who, late last month, released an unofficial memo\n\nthat condemned the findings of the environmental assessment review panel.\n In their memo, the employees said that the allegations of widespread\n\ndisease may be unfounded because the most recent thorough study of the herd\n\ntook place in 1975.\n As well, the memo\'s authors claimed that the proposed slaughter put\n\nthe interests of cattle farmers above the integrity of Canada\'s national\n\nparks.\n But agriculture experts say that the risk of contamination to cattle\n\ncould prove more costly in the long run.\n Officials declared Canada\'s 14 million cattle free of brucellosis in\n\n1985 and expect them to be rid of tuberculosis by next year, creating greater\n\nexport opportunities in the United States and fewer inspection requirements.\n Federal officials say that Ottawa\'s &dollar;500-million fight to\n\neradicate both diseases in cattle may now be in jeopardy because of the Wood\n\nBuffalo herd.\n Said John Kellar, Ottawa-based associate director of disease control\n\nat Agriculture Canada:  " We might risk our reputation for safe beef\n\nexports.\n Slaughter seems drastic, but it\'s the only way to solve this."\n\n \n\n  Meanwhile, Agriculture Minister Donald Mazankowski supported de\n\nCotret in opposing the proposed mass slaughter.\n said that he plans to\n\nseek cabinet support for a quarantine and partial slaughter of the animals\n\ninstead.\n That approach drew support from some naturalists and wildlife experts\n\nwho say that mass slaughter would be a destructive solution to an exaggerated\n\nproblem.\n Said Lindsay Wasylyshyn, vice-president of the Metis Association in\n\nFort Smith, N.W.T., just across the Alberta border from Wood Buffalo Park:\n\n " Those buffalo are part of a food chain that extends from the wolves\n\non down to the bugs.\n\n But, without a cure or vaccine on the horizon, many of the park\'s\n\nbison may still be facing a death sentence.  \n\n\n A battle for control: Islanders take on the mighty Irving empire\n\n\n\n  During the 1860s, violent riots broke out on Prince Edward Island\n\nas tenant farmers tried to gain ownership from absentee British landlords who\n\ncontrolled the island\'s farmland.\n The farmers eventually succeeded.\n But now, Island farmers are up in arms again over what they claim is\n\nan attempt by a single, powerful family to gain control over a large block of\n\nP.E.I. farmland.\n The dispute places Premier Joseph Ghiz, who is also the province\'s\n\njustice minister, in opposition to billionaire industrialist K. C. Irving and\n\none of his granddaughters.\n In April, Ghiz wrote to Mary Jean Irving, telling her and her\n\nhusband, Stewart Dockendorff, that he had reason to believe they had acquired\n\nmore land than the province permitted and ordered them to divest themselves\n\nof some of it.\n If Irving is charged and found guilty of contravening the Lands\n\nProtection Act, she could face a fine of &dollar;5,000 or up to six months in\n\njail. \n\n  Ghiz is placing the resources of his tiny island against the\n\nmighty Saint John, N.B.-based Irving industrial empire, with an estimated\n\n&dollar;10 billion in assets in 1989.\n Irving interests now own or control nearly 25,000 acres of P.E.I.\n\ncropland - about six per cent of the provincial total.\n Said Daniel Hendricken, who farms 125 acres of land near\n\nFanningbrook, 35 km east of Charlottetown:  " Island farmers fought\n\nhard to get control of their land.\n\n\n  Since 1971, the Irving family plant at Cavendish Farms at New\n\nAnnan, 62 km southwest of Charlottetown, has processed potatoes grown on\n\n3,000 acres of their land and another 17,000 acres leased or controlled by\n\nthem.\n In April, Conservative opposition leader Leone Bagnall declared that\n\nMary Jean Irving and her husband had purchased 4,800 additional acres of\n\nfarmland individually and on behalf of Indian River Farms Ltd., the\n\ncorporation they control.\n ( Under Island law at the time, corporations could own a maximum of\n\n3,000 acres; individuals could own 1,000 acres each.)\n Bagnall\'s revelation led 135 Island farmers to stage a protest march\n\nin Charlottetown on April 23.\n Said James Rodd, a regional co-ordinator for the National Farmers\n\nUnion:  " We don\'t want to go back to the time on P.E.I. when we were\n\ntenants."  \n\n  Pressed to take action, Ghiz\'s Liberal government rushed a bill\n\nthrough the legislature limiting future corporate acquisitions to five acres.\n For her part, Mary Jean Irving, who has until July 22 to reply to\n\nGhiz\'s letter, insists that there is no connection between her grandfather\'s\n\nempire and the land she and her husband own.\n Meanwhile, the dispute may have contributed to a slowdown in Irving\n\ninvestments.\n Some Islanders say that a planned expansion of Cavendish Farms was\n\nput on hold after Ghiz\'s government began taking on the mighty Irving empire.\n\n \n\n\n MYSTERY IN THE FIELDS: Experts study bizarre marks on the ground\n\n\n\n  Jennifer Skinner says that only aliens could have caused what\n\nhappened in her wheat field outside of Lethbridge, Alta.\n Skinner\'s son-in-law, Cyril Hubbard, was the first member of the\n\nfamily to spot the strange occurrence: on Sept. 1, while harvesting in a\n\nfield, he noticed two 15-foot-wide circles connected by paths to a\n\n20-foot-wide circle.\n said Skinner after viewing the\n\nsite.  <\n " There\'s no tracks, nothing.\n This has been done from the air somehow.\n\n Skinner\'s is one of at least six mysterious " crop circle sites" that\n\nhave appeared in southern Alberta fields since Aug. 21.\n Circles of flattened grain have been reported in hundreds of\n\nlocations across North America, Britain and Australia.\n Researchers are baffled by the phenomenon.\n Says Herman Austenson, a professor of crop sciences at the University\n\nof Saskatchewan in Saskatoon who studied a site near North Battleford, Sask.:\n\n " I can tell you one thing - it absolutely is not a hoax.\n\n\n  In Canada, the first crop circles were reported in Langenburg,\n\nSask., in 1974.\n In the past two years, about 20 more circles have been found in\n\nSaskatchewan and Alberta, and more have been reported across the western\n\nUnited States.\n The largest concentration of circles is in England.\n According to Ralph Noyes, secretary of the 800-member, year-old\n\nCentre for Crop Circle Studies in London, scientists have documented more\n\nthan 1,000 so-called circle events in Britain.\n About half of those have occurred in a 20-square-mile corner of the\n\nsouthern English county of Wiltshire.\n There, Britons have seen and photographed an assortment of patterns\n\nof flattened grain. \n\n  Theories about the causes of crop circles range from unconfirmed\n\nassumptions about extraterrestrial spaceships allegedly hovering over\n\nagricultural land to scientific explanations involving lightning, magnetic\n\nfields and unusual wind patterns.\n Ieuan Evans, a supervisor in the Alberta government\'s plant-diseases\n\nsection in Edmonton, offers an agriculturally based theory: he says that a\n\nlack of nutrients, such as copper, in the soil could cause grain to collapse\n\nunder its own weight.\n Still, the most widely accepted explanation comes from Terence\n\nMeaden, director of the Circle Effects Research Group in Bradford-on-Avon,\n\nnear Bath, England.\n Meaden, who was once a physics professor at Dalhousie University in\n\nHalifax, says that the circles are created by " ring vortices" - electrically\n\ncharged spinning balls of air that form when winds flow over hills.\n According to Meaden, the vortices sometimes touch down briefly in\n\nfields, flattening the crops growing there in a circular pattern. \n\n  Some other experts offer more fanciful explanations.\n "\n\ndisplays an almost limitless inventiveness, an ability to design and\n\nredesign." \n " What the hell it is, what degree of intelligence\n\nit exhibits, I wouldn\'t know."  \n\n  But whatever their cause, the circles have a strong effect on\n\nsome of the people who see them.\n Last summer, Darrell Roth spotted circles in a neighbor\'s wheat field\n\nnear Christopher Lake, 50 km north of Prince Albert, Sask.\n Roth, the editor and publisher of the Lake-scapes Weekly, a tourist\n\nnewspaper, said that one circle was between 60 and 70 feet in diameter and\n\nthat the wheat inside it was completely flattened.\n Around it was a four- to five-foot-wide band of wheat that was still\n\nstanding and, beyond that, another two- to three-foot-wide circle in which\n\nthe wheat had collapsed.\n Roth said that about 300 yards away, there was a smaller set of\n\ncircles.\n said Roth.\n\n\n \'Who the heck are we?\'\n\n when you see something like what I saw."   \n\n  Even pranksters are considered a possible cause of the circles.\n Says Gordon Kijek, director of an Edmonton-based group that studies\n\nreports of unidentified flying objects:  " We could end up tomorrow\n\nwith a group stepping forward and saying, \'We did it, and here\'s how we did\n\nit.\' " \n After the two crop circles were discovered near Lethbridge last week,\n\nKijek collected grain and soil samples from one site and sent them to a\n\nprovincial laboratory in Edmonton for testing.\n Still, he says that he suspects some form of intelligent being was\n\ninvolved.\n Kijek\n\nadded. \n\n\n\n But the search for the real answers about the mystery so far has\n\ntaken a circular route. \n\n  Illustration: Photo: A circle site near Lethbridge: the\n\ntheories range from unusual wind patterns to extraterrestrial spaceships. <O>', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'bd79d3b7-15e4-42a9-8a5c-84c45510e7a7', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.842772+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9637688398361206, 'non_english_score': 0.036231160163879395}
{'text': 'A GLIMPSE OF HEAVEN: the sun\'s corona blazed in a darkened sky\n\n\n\n  It was an event so rare in nature that some scientists and curious\n\nlaymen travelled thousands of miles to points along Mexico\'s Baja peninsula\n\nto watch.\n Others viewed last week\'s eclipse of the sun in Hawaii after arriving\n\nby aircraft or aboard luxury cruise ships.\n Altogether, millions of people, including at least 200,000 visitors\n\nfrom scores of countries, watched from Hawaii to Brazil as the longest and\n\nmost spectacular solar eclipse of the century briefly plunged some parts of\n\nthe world into darkness on July 11.\n said\n\nMichael Watson, a Toronto lawyer and amateur astronomer who led 155 members\n\nof the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada to Baja for the eclipse. \n\n\n  During a period in which the eclipse was visible in the best\n\nviewing locations for a maximum of six minutes and 54 seconds, the moon\n\npassed between the Earth and the sun, causing the shadow of the moon to blot\n\nout the sun\'s light.\n In an area stretching from Hawaii through Baja and over mainland\n\nMexico, south through Latin America and Brazil, darkness descended.\n In some areas on the path of the eclipse, birds grew silent and\n\nanimals acted as though night had fallen.\n It was the longest total eclipse of the sun since 1973; there will\n\nnot be another to equal it until the year 2132.\n In most parts of the United States and Canada, the event that some\n\nenthusiasts called " the eclipse of the millennium" was seen as partial:\n\ntypically, in the cloudy sky over Vancouver, only 15 per cent of the sun was\n\nobscured. \n\n  Working from one of the locations where the eclipse could be seen\n\nmost completely, scientists at Hawaii\'s Mauna Kea observatory trained seven\n\ntelescopes and dozens of cameras on the sun in the hope of gathering\n\nscientific data that may answer fundamental questions about the sun\'s\n\nchemistry.\n Said David Naylor, a professor of physics at Alberta\'s University of\n\nLethbridge and one of two Canadian scientists who saw the eclipse from Mauna\n\nKea:  " It was an absolute miracle that the path of the eclipse passed\n\nright overhead of the best observing site on Earth." \n For those standing directly beneath the umbra, or dark inner part, of\n\nthe moon\'s shadow, the sun\'s corona, or outer atmosphere, blazed in a\n\ndarkened sky.\n " This is a once-in-three-lifetimes\n\nphenomenon." \n But in the end, scientists said, the less-than-perfect weather\n\nconditions somewhat obscured the eclipse. \n\n  Scientists said that few events in nature surpass the eerie\n\neffect of a total solar eclipse.\n About once every 16 months, the moon briefly passes between the sun\n\nand the Earth, blocking the sun\'s rays.\n But such eclipses last only seconds and are visible only on some\n\nparts of the Earth\'s surface.\n What made last week\'s eclipse uncommon was that the moon was\n\nexceptionally close to the Earth and the Earth was at its farthest annual\n\npoint from the sun.\n\n\n  Solar eclipses have inspired awe and terror since the dawn of\n\ncivilization.\n Indeed, the word eclipse is derived from the Greek word for\n\nabandonment, reflecting an ancient fear that the sun might abandon Earth.\n As far back as 2000 BC, Babylonian astronomers discovered how to\n\npredict accurately when the moon would obscure the sun.\n Historical records show that an eclipse of the sun in 585 BC inspired\n\nsuch fear among warring Medes and Lydians in what is now Turkey that they\n\nagreed to make peace. \n\n  Over the centuries, observations of solar eclipses have produced\n\nimportant scientific results.\n During an eclipse in 1868, the English scientist Norman Lockyer\n\ndiscovered the element helium, which makes up a large part of the sun\'s\n\nburning mass of gases.\n Starting in 1919, scientists began measuring starlight patterns\n\nduring solar eclipses in an effort to prove Albert Einstein\'s theory of\n\nrelativity.\n More generally, the blockage of intense solar light during an eclipse\n\nallows scientists to measure the size, activity and composition of the star\n\nthat sustains life on Earth.\n " We have basically just a few seconds to get an\n\nenormous amount of information."  \n\n  Astronomers said that data gathered during the latest eclipse may\n\nconfirm suspicions about the changing diameter of the sun, which is believed\n\nto be 4.5 billion years old and slowly diminishing.\n For their part, American and Mexican scientists launched a small\n\nrocket 50 miles into the atmosphere during the eclipse from Santiago\n\nIxcuintla, about 200 km north of Guadalajara along the Pacific coast.\n Although the &dollar;184,000 mission was supposed to record\n\ninformation about solar particles, it failed because of technical\n\ndifficulties. \n\n  Most of those gathered for the century\'s most spectacular\n\ncelestial event said that they were awestruck by the eclipse.\n Said Andrea Hansen, a Toronto screenwriter who saw the eclipse in\n\nBaja California, Mexico:  " It makes you feel a part of the universe."\n\n\n Added Watson, who saw his first eclipse from Quebec\'s Gaspe Peninsula\n\nin 1972:  " You really get hooked by these astronomical events."\n\n\n Clearly, for addicts, last week\'s celestial fix was truly a glimpse\n\nof heaven.  \n\n\n\n\n  In the fall of 1984, John Simpson, a professor of physics at\n\nOntario\'s University of Guelph, carried out an experiment that produced\n\nresults that could be crucial to  understanding of the\n\nuniverse - and its ultimate destiny.\n Simpson was trying to measure the mass of elementary particles called\n\nelectron neutrinos, which are emitted from atoms during radioactive decay.\n In December of that year, Simpson made a discovery that many other\n\nscientists said was probably erroneous: he found that some neutrinos had a\n\nmuch higher mass than scientists had previously believed possible.\n But last November, scientists at a laboratory in Berkeley, Calif.,\n\ndisclosed that they had duplicated Simpson\'s results.\n Some physicists said that, as a result, theorists now may face the\n\nprospect of having to rethink some widely held theories about the creation\n\nand composition of the universe.\n Said Gerald Roy, a nuclear physicist at the University of Alberta in\n\nEdmonton:  " If the theory is correct, it will turn a lot of things\n\nupside-down in the physics world."  \n\n  Simpson said that what he discovered in 1984 and in follow-up\n\nexperiments were neutrinos with two different masses, including some with\n\nmasses of 17 kiloelectronvolts ( the mass of subatomic matter is quoted in\n\nunits of energy).\n Scientists previously said that neutrinos have little or no mass.\n Simpson made his discovery with the help of a particle accelerator, a\n\ndevice that shoots atomic particles at one-tenth the speed of light, at\n\nMcMaster University in Hamilton.\n But after Simpson published his findings in the New York City-based\n\njournal Physical Review Letters in April, 1985, scientists in Canada, the\n\nUnited States and Europe were unable to duplicate his findings in experiments\n\nof their own.\n As well, Simpson, a 51-year-old native of North Bay, Ont., who won a\n\nscholarship in 1962 to England\'s Oxford University, where he earned a PhD in\n\nphysics, said that there was widespread skepticism about his discovery\n\nbecause it caused  " some problems with physics as we know it."\n\n\n " People were not ashamed to tell me they did not\n\nbelieve it."  \n\n  Now, the experimental findings reported by scientists at the U.S.\n\ndepartment of energy\'s Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in Berkeley could change\n\nthat.\n Eric Norman, a nuclear physicist at that lab, disclosed at a physics\n\nconference held in Czechoslovakia in November that experiments carried out in\n\nthe Berkeley laboratory appeared to confirm Simpson\'s discovery.\n Norman told Maclean\'s that he subsequently submitted a paper on his\n\nfindings to Physical Review Letters, and editors at the Review said that\n\nNorman\'s paper has been considered for publication early in 1991. \n\n  The confirmation of Simpson\'s discovery could lead to a major\n\nrevision of accepted theories about the nature, and eventual fate, of the\n\nuniverse.\n According to a body of scientific thought known as the big bang\n\ntheory, the universe was created in a cosmic explosion about 15 billion years\n\nago.\n Supporters of the big bang theory say that, ever since, all the\n\nmatter in the universe, including stars and planets, has been moving away\n\nfrom the starting point and will continue to do so throughout eternity.\n But adherents of a rival theory contend that the expanding universe\n\nmay reach a point at which, if the total mass of the universe is great\n\nenough, it will slow down, stop and then begin contracting again towards the\n\ncentre.\n If that happens, some theorists say, the densely compacted mass at\n\nthe centre of the universe will eventually heat up and destroy itself by\n\nexploding again - and set a new universe in motion. \n\n  Until recently, most physicists calculated that the total mass of\n\nthe universe was not sufficient to cause it to stop expanding.\n But those calculations were based on the belief that neutrinos have\n\nvirtually no mass.\n Although Simpson\'s findings would only apply to about one-third of\n\nall neutrinos, Roy said that if heavy neutrinos exist, then previous\n\ncalculations would mean that the effect of gravity on them would eventually\n\ncause the universe to contract.\n The discovery of the heavy neutrinos, said Clifford Hargrove, a\n\nphysicist at the Ottawa-based Centre for Research in Particle Physics,\n\n " challenges the underpinnings of physics regarding the building\n\nblocks of matter."  \n\n  Roy added that if Simpson\'s findings are widely verified, he\n\ncould be in line for the Nobel Prize in physics, which is awarded annually to\n\nscientists who achieve major breakthroughs.\n " are that important."\n\n\n For his part, Norman said that when he began his experiments in\n\nCalifornia two years ago, he was skeptical about the possibility of heavy\n\nneutrinos.\n But he added that the result of his laboratory work turned out to be\n\n " the most exciting thing I have ever been involved with." \n\n\n\n  Simpson told Maclean\'s that he had arranged for a leave from his\n\nteaching post for the 1990-1991 school year to work on the planned\n\n&dollar;61-million neutrino observatory under construction more than a mile\n\nunderground in a mine shaft near Sudbury, Ont.\n There, according to Simpson and other scientists, by studying\n\nneutrinos that penetrate the Earth\'s crust from outer space, they may be able\n\nto learn more about the tiny particles and the role they play in the\n\nunfolding of the universe.\n Despite the Sudbury commitment, Simpson said that he would continue\n\nto work on his neutrino mass experiments in an effort to confirm the\n\nexistence of heavy neutrinos.\n If he succeeds, excitement over Simpson\'s discovery would almost\n\ncertainly be tempered by the questions they raise about the creation, and the\n\nfuture, of the universe.  \n\n \n\n\n  The quest is for the Holy Grail of modern science - a\n\nmultibillion-dollar international crusade to map in meticulous detail the\n\nhundreds of thousands of bits of information that make up the human genetic\n\ncode, or genome.\n Scientists say that the information they hope to discover will offer\n\nclues to the causes - and possible cures - of more than 4,000 inherited\n\ndiseases, as well as many others with suspected genetic links, including\n\nheart disease, schizophrenia and Alzheimer\'s disease.\n Others predict that the 15-year project will ultimately allow people\n\nto know, and perhaps change, their genetic makeup - or the genes of unborn\n\nchildren.\n The project has prompted debate in some medical circles over the\n\nethical implications.\n Indeed, some scientists say that the growing fund of genetic\n\nknowledge could lead to human rights infringements if people are rejected for\n\njobs or insurance policies because of flaws in their genetic makeup.\n At the same time, some Canadian scientists say that bureaucratic\n\nwrangling has helped to stall efforts to secure funding for a Canadian role\n\nin the massive project. \n\n  Expected to cost up to &dollar;4 billion over the next 15 years,\n\nthe U.S. Genome Project, launched in 1989, has grown into an international\n\neffort involving the work of an estimated 3,000 scientists in the United\n\nStates, Europe, the Soviet Union and Japan.\n Now, Canadian scientists say that they will need up to &dollar;150\n\nmillion to fund a Canadian contribution to the genome map during the next 15\n\nyears.',

{'text': '" SOON DOZENS, THEN HUNDREDS, APPEAR, AND THE BIG COTTONWOODS SAG\n\nUNDER THE WEIGHT OF SO MANY BIRDS" \n\n  Brackendale is asleep as the eagles gather on the Squamish.\n One by one, in pairs and threes, they come down from their night\n\nroosts to the river.\n Soon dozens, then hundreds, appear, and the big cottonwoods sag under\n\nthe weight of so many birds.\n In the dreary, winter-grey drizzle, a treetop candelabrum of feathered\n\nivory heads is silhouetted against the granite walls of the Tantalus Range.\n\n\n\n  The air is rank with rotting salmon.\n Sunrise softens an overcast sky as the eagles move onto the carcasses.\n The hungry birds are alone in this hour after dawn, scant respite\n\nfrom the joggers and dogs, paddlers and tourists that soon will disrupt\n\ntheir feeding. \n\n  For as long as the salmon have come home to spawn, the bald\n\neagles have followed the autumn fish runs to the coastal rivers of British\n\nColumbia.\n The Bella Coola, Harrison, Dean, Qualicum, Cowichan, and many more.\n Day after day, each bird devours nearly a tenth of its own body\n\nweight in fish - as much as half a kilo.\n In a bountiful year, when 250,000 chum return to the Squamish, the\n\neagles could consume a hundred tonnes of dead salmon.\n By February, when all the fish have spawned, the feast is over: the\n\navian carnivores again face the hardship of hunting herring, waterfowl,\n\nrabbits, and rodents. \n\n  The Squamish River runs down from the Coast Mountains into Howe\n\nSound, on the northwest side of Vancouver.\n It is the second-largest river, after the Fraser, bringing fresh\n\nwater to the Strait of Georgia.\n When chum are running in the Squamish, huge flocks of scavenging\n\neagles congregate near the community of Brackendale, 10 kilometres\n\nupstream from Howe Sound.\n The birds feed on the banks of the mainstem and tributaries - the\n\nCheakamus, Cheekye, Mamquam, and Ashlu.\n In the winter of 1994, the Squamish had the largest concentration of\n\nbald eagles on Earth - 3,769 - 274 more than the world record set in the\n\n1980s at Alaska\'s Chilkat River.    \n\n  " When you start talking about 4,000 eagles, you\n\nsometimes forget that 25 eagles is a lot,"  says Thor Froslev,\n\ncurator of the Brackendale Art Gallery.\n When Froslev organized the first Brackendale Winter Eagle Festival in\n\n1986, some 537 were counted.\n Each year, with changes in counting effort, weather, and fish runs,\n\neagle numbers vary considerably.\n In 1988 more than 2,500 were recorded; in 1991 only 737.\n The tallying teams were optimistic in 1994, but on the count day no\n\none expected a world record. \n\n \n\nning the board in the art gallery, writing down the numbers as they come\n\nin,"  Froslev recalls excitedly. \n " In one area there were 200 eagles, then all of a sudden\n\nthere were 600.\n I\'m going, \'hmm, that\'s good.\'\n But then there was an area where we usually count 600 eagles - there\n\nwere 1,365.\n I nearly fell off the chair.\n\n\n  Froslev, a 62-year-old transplanted Dane, is an outdoorsman with\n\nan entrepreneurial bent.\n To him, thousands of eagles landing halfway up the highway\n\nbetween Vancouver and Whistler augur a tourist boon, dependent on the\n\ngood health of his beloved Squamish River.\n The eagles peak around Christmas when tourism is highest at Whistler\n\nski village.\n Eagle viewers are increasing, but more could be encouraged to\n\nstop over a few hours at Brackendale as they head to the slopes. \n\n  Eighty percent of the Squamish eagles concentrate on a\n\nnine-kilometre stretch of stream between the Cheakamus and Mamquam rivers.\n Brackendale sits at the centre of this area, on the east bank where\n\ndikes provide access for wildlife watchers.\n The river forms a natural boundary, separating the town and\n\ntourists from the west bank, where nobody lives. \n\n  The only protected place for eagles on the Squamish is a\n\n71-hectare ecological reserve at Baynes Island, set aside to save old\n\ncottonwoods used by the eagles as daytime perches.\n Local conservationists have asked the provincial government to create\n\na 1,077-hectare eagle refuge along both sides of the river.\n Alaska\'s Chilkat Bald Eagle Reserve, by comparison, is 20,000\n\nhectares. \n\n \n\nFroslev stresses. \n " We need that timber on the far side for the eagles, and to\n\nhelp slow the runoff.\n It\'s no good having a river, trying to have fish in it, trying\n\nto encourage and enhance birds, unless you\'ve got trees."   \n\n  Recent research suggests that roosting trees could be as\n\nimportant as the food that attracts the eagles.\n With adults weighing between three and six kilograms, they\n\nconsistently choose the largest trees.\n On many coastal rivers they perch during the day on the stout\n\nbranches of mature cottonwoods, close to the water and fish. \n\n  At night the eagles roost communally, sometimes as far as five\n\nkilometres from their food.\n Some night roosts are deep in old-growth coniferous forests,\n\nsheltered from winter winds, rain, snow, and people.\n The same roost sites may be used year after year, yet biologists are\n\nuncertain why eagles pick particular places.\n If these night roosts and daytime perches are logged, there\'s no\n\nguarantee the birds will simply move to another stand of trees.\n\n\n  This year more than 1,600 wintering eagles gorged themselves on\n\nspawning salmon in the Fraser Valley.\n Half these birds foraged the banks of the Harrison River, a Fraser\n\ntributary that usually has the third-highest annual count on the continent.\n Some 18 communal night roosts are known in the lower Fraser where\n\nlogging companies are working with wildlife experts to reduce disturbance to\n\nwintering eagles.\n Seasonal logging in some areas has been delayed until the eagles have\n\nleft the streams.\n At Carey Islands, 10 kilometres downstream from Agassiz, Scott Paper\n\nLtd. became the first B.C. forestry firm to preserve a communal night roost\n\nfor bald eagles. \n\n  Eagle advocates hope industrialists at Squamish, on the opposite\n\nside of Vancouver, will follow the Fraser Valley example.\n The seaport of Squamish has already displaced much of the estuary\n\nwith its logging, rail yards, dikes, and dredging.\n Upstream, logging has begun on the west bank, where the eagles have\n\nenjoyed at least some sanctuary from the Brackendale bustle.         \n\n  Other concerns are pressing.\n BC Rail wants to expand its operations in the lower valley.\n An American airline is pushing for scheduled service into Squamish\n\nMunicipal Airport, which now takes only charter flights.\n And increasing helicopter traffic at tree level along the river\n\ncorridor is often scaring off feeding eagles. \n\n  " We\'ve got a gem, an absolute world-class gem of a\n\nconcentration of eagles up there,"  says Dave Dunbar of the B.C.\n\nWildlife Branch in Surrey. \n " It\'s an envious position to be in for a province to\n\nhave something that\'s a world spectacle, yet a lot of people take it for\n\ngranted."   \n\n  One would hope we\'d heed the warnings from earlier in this\n\ncentury when disdain for North American birds of prey almost caused their\n\nextinction.\n Like other predators, eagles were exterminated by humans as\n\nvermin.\n Even more devastating was DDT, an insidious pesticide that reduces\n\nthe calcium content in eggs, causing them to break.\n It was spread liberally across North American farms shortly after the\n\nSecond World War.\n Eagle populations were still crashing in 1970 when Canada\n\nseriously restricted the use of DDT.\n\n\n  Dunbar now is helping assess the bald eagle\'s recovery.\n A bird and non-game specialist, he\'s responsible for province-wide\n\neagle counts, which began in 1986.\n Each year on a day in mid-January, hundreds of volunteers don winter\n\nwoollies and gumboots to scour riverbanks, beaches, and wetlands.\n The emphasis is on the coast, where ice-free waters, abundant salmon,\n\nherring, and waterfowl entice eagles from Alaska, Montana, Idaho, Washington,\n\nOregon, and Interior B.C. \n\n  This year 6,129 eagles were counted in B.C.\n The province\'s total mid-winter population is estimated at 20,000 to\n\n30,000 eagles, about one-third more than in all of the lower 48 states.\n With an Alaskan population of 30,000 to 40,000 wintering eagles, the\n\nheraldic American national emblem has only this year been downgraded from an\n\nendangered to a threatened species in the U.S. \n\n  With a guesstimated nesting population of 9,000 adults, B.C.\'s\n\nbald eagles are far from endangered.\n But their day-to-day life is nonetheless fraught with hazards,\n\nparticularly on the urbanized south coast.\n Nanaimo veterinarian Ken Langelier examined 490 dead, injured,\n\nor ailing bald eagles between 1988 and 1994.\n He discovered that one of the most frequent killers - 17.6\n\npercent - is electrocution. \n\n  Langelier contends that the accelerated pace of oceanfront\n\ndevelopment is the cause.\n As houses go up, trees come down, depleting nesting and perching\n\nsites.\n Utility poles servicing new subdivisions are an eagle\'s next best\n\nchoice.\n A skilful fisher, a bald eagle may saturate its wings with salt\n\nwater as it swoops down to pluck a fish from the sea.\n When it perches atop a power pole and spreads its wings a full two\n\nmetres to dry, it may touch two wires, electrocuting itself as it shorts out\n\nthe neighbourhood.\n Langelier, who has submitted a report to BC Hydro, suggests that\n\nwires be strung farther apart and eagle perches be placed above the lines.\n\n\n\n  Another common killer is poisoning - 11.4 percent in Langelier\'s\n\nstudy.\n When they eat tainted prey, eagles ingest carbofurans, barbiturates,\n\nmercury, and dioxins. \n\n  One of the most agonizing toxins is lead.\n During the autumn hunting season, eagles often swallow lead shot when\n\nfeeding on dead or dying waterfowl.\n " Lead poisoning is a real insult to the bird\'s whole\n\nphysiology,"  Langelier explains.   " It affects the blood\n\nvessels, especially in the heart, so they actually develop tiny infarcts, or\n\nblockages, like little heart attacks.\n Some bald eagles with lead poisoning simply starve to death because\n\nthey can\'t breathe, hear, or see, or don\'t have the physical stamina to\n\ncapture food.\n Or they can be so acutely poisoned that they go into convulsions and\n\ndie."   \n\n  Thanks to Langelier\'s vociferous persistence, the government\n\nbanned hunters across B.C. this year from using lead shot to shoot waterfowl.\n " A lot of people feel that eagles are extremely abundant\n\nhere and there\'s no need to worry,"  observes Dave Dunbar. \n " I just feel that would be a dangerous attitude toward a\n\nspecies that is highly vulnerable."   \n\n  Ironically, promoting respect for wild eagles also poses a\n\nthreat.\n " are having a profound impact\n\non the  ability to forage there,"  Dunbar warns.\n The eagles are most active in the morning, but early-rising\n\nbirdwatchers often frighten feeding eagles up into the trees. \n\n  At Victoria\'s Goldstream Provincial Park, a " quiet zone" allows\n\nthe eagles to feed in peace.\n In the early 1990s, an average of five dozen foraged the lower\n\nreaches of the Goldstream River, where access was restricted.\n When the quiet zone was expanded this year to encompass the entire\n\nestuary, the number of eagles jumped to 90.  \n\n  Park naturalist Carol Berryman has witnessed the effect people\n\nhave on foraging eagles.\n On one winter morning the tide was low and the salmon carcasses were\n\nexposed, yet there were no eagles on the flats.\n Berryman then noticed two people walking on the estuary.\n She chased them off and several eagles immediately came down to\n\nfeed. \n\n  " People are really good about not going out there when\n\nyou explain why,"  says Berryman.\n A video camera and monitor now are set up in a nature house above\n\nthe estuary to provide a televised view of the birds.\n Those who want a closer look can bring high-powered spotting scopes.\n\n\n " They see many, many more eagles: they just can\'t get\n\nclose."   \n\n  Hikers, cyclists, kayakers, and river rafters on the Squamish\n\nmay face similar restrictions, says Dunbar. \n " We could just merrily go on promoting wildlife viewing\n\nfor eagles and kill the very thing that we\'re trying to promote ....\n We\'ve got just a little golden egg here in British Columbia.\n Truly, the province is blessed with a special thing and we\'ve got\n\nto make sure we can hang onto it.\n We should promote it in a way that doesn\'t harm the birds."\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n TEN TIMES THE SIZE OF STANLEY PARK, VANCOUVER\'S UNKNOWN\n\nWILDERNESS JEWEL IS BEING EATEN AWAY BY DEVELOPMENT AND GARBAGE \n\n  After hours of hiking through waist-high Labrador tea and sala,\n\nI\'m beginning to appreciate the enormous size of Burns Bog.\n We enter a grove tea of stunted trees, and my guide, Don DeMille,\n\npoints out mature pines, the tallest barely two metres high.\n he grins.\n I\'m more concerned with the ground, quivering beneath me like a\n\ngiant waterbed.\n DeMille says, striding\n\nahead.\n Lagoons in a bog?\n\n\n  Barely out of the " magic forest," I stop, stunned by the wild\n\nbeauty ahead.\n A series of lagoons, bright yellow with blooming water lilies.\n Brown and red sphagnum moss carpets the sides of the lagoons.\n Two hawks shriek overhead as they spiral upward, their broad tails\n\nglowing red.\n\n\n  Like many residents of British Columbia\'s Lower Mainland, I\'d\n\nalways associated Burns Bog with the Greater Vancouver Regional District\'s\n\nmassive garbage dump.\n The huge landfill, in Delta, south of the City of Vancouver, takes\n\nin part of the bog. \n\n  I realize now that this is hardly a dump: it\'s a wilderness in\n\nthe midst of a metropolis, between the Fraser River and Boundary Bay.\n A staggering 4,000 hectares, Burns Bog is 10 times the size of\n\nVancouver\'s Stanley Park.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '93f8e68e-ea92-4d16-8d89-82fdec3764cf', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.845356+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9554447531700134, 'non_english_score': 0.04455524682998657}
{'text': 'By most estimates, the neutron star, or pulsar, known as\n\nPSR1829-10 may not be much to look at.\n In fact, it cannot be seen at all.\n Scientists say that the star, located near the centre of the Milky\n\nWay, is a dense, dark orb.\n It is about 30,000 light years from Earth ( light travels through\n\nspace at 5.878 trillion miles per year) and was formed by a supernova\n\nexplosion, the spectacular celestial event that occurs when the molten core\n\nof a star implodes, sending shock waves right through the universe.\n The pulsar, which emits radio waves at regular intervals, was one of\n\n40 such stars discovered in 1985 by scientists at the Nuffield Radio\n\nAstronomy Laboratories at Jodrell Bank, 30 km south of Manchester, in\n\nnorthern England.\n Astronomers using Nuffield\'s giant radio telescope found that sound\n\npulses emitted by 39 of the neutron stars were unwavering.\n But the fluctuating responses from the 40th pulsar led them to a\n\nstartling conclusion.\n In a letter published last week by the British journal Nature, they\n\nspeculated that the 40th pulsar was being pulled out of its orbit by an\n\norbiting planet.\n If that explanation survives the critical scrutiny of the scientific\n\ncommunity, the planet will be the first to be detected outside of Earth\'s\n\nSolar System. \n\n  Scientists have long predicted that other planetary systems must\n\nexist and would eventually be found somewhere in the universe.\n But despite some claims in the past, scientists have never been able\n\nto provide conclusive evidence to justify that theory.\n They said that the apparent discovery of another planetary system\n\nwould have important implications for  understanding of\n\nthe universe, and could point the way towards the discovery of other\n\nplanetary systems.\n Said Paul Delaney, a professor of astronomy at Toronto\'s York\n\nUniversity:  " Until now, we only knew for sure about one planetary\n\nsystem around one star - the Sun.\n\n\n  The evidence indicating that PSR1829-10 probably has at least one\n\norbiting planet was assembled by three Jodrell Bank astronomers, Andrew Lyne,\n\nMatthew Bailes and Setnam Shemar.\n Lyne told Maclean\'s that after the observatory identified the new\n\npulsars six years ago, the lab monitored each of the neutron stars on a\n\nregular basis using its 250-foot-diameter Lovell telescope that receives\n\nradio waves.\n Neutron stars cannot be seen with an optical telescope because their\n\nlight cannot travel far from the galactic centre.\n But he said that he and his colleagues had noticed during routine\n\nobservations with the giant telescope that PSR1829-10 emitted an irregular\n\npattern of pulses.\n Lyne said that after they detected that pattern, he and Bailes, an\n\nAustralian who began working at the Nuffield Laboratories only 18 months ago,\n\ntested their observations against established mathematical models in an\n\nattempt to explain the fluctuations.\n Lyne said that it was not until last May that it occurred to them\n\nthat they might have discovered a planet.\n " It was a purely serendipitous discovery."\n\n \n\n  The Jodrell Bank astronomers said that although the pulsar\n\nusually gave off a regular pattern of pulses, they observed that at times the\n\npulses would slow by one one-hundredth of a second.\n Then, three months later, the pulses would speed up again.\n After recording several cycles, Lyne said, the astronomers concluded\n\nthat the pulsar was  " being tugged a bit"  by a planet with\n\nan almost circular, six-month orbit.\n " The most natural interpretation of this pulse variation is\n\nthat the star has a companion orbiting around it,"  Lyne said. \n\n  The discovery of another planetary system, which has yet to be\n\nconfirmed by other astronomers, came after years of fruitless effort by\n\nastronomers around the world.\n During the past decade, scientists have been able to look ever deeper\n\ninto space with the aid of sophisticated new telescopes capable of producing\n\nhigh-resolution images of celestial bodies.\n Still, Delaney said that while these tools have come tantalizingly\n\nclose to finding other planetary systems, none has provided enough evidence\n\nto satisfy the scientific community.\n He said that the powerful telescopes could not overcome the blinding\n\nglare that obscures the view of objects surrounding bright, relatively young\n\nstars, including the Sun.\n Because the Jodrell Bank telescope responds to radio waves coming\n\nfrom distant objects in space, rather than light, glare does not affect it.\n\n\n\n  Excitement among scientists over the possible detection of\n\nanother planetary system was tempered by disappointment that it is too far\n\naway to be seen - and by the fact that the planet is unlikely to support any\n\nform of life.\n Lyne said that the planet orbiting the pulsar probably has a mass of\n\nabout 12 times that of Earth, and a circumference that may be two to three\n\ntimes that of Earth\'s.\n The inspected planet apparently orbits its pulsar sun at a distance\n\nof about 67.24 million miles, roughly equal to the distance between the Sun\n\nand the planet Venus.\n Astronomers also speculated that the planet is under constant\n\nbombardment by high levels of deadly radiation from its host neutron star.\n Said Gerald Quinlan, a research associate at the Toronto-based\n\nCanadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics:  " It is highly\n\nunlikely that any life form could survive in that environment."  \n\n  Although other scientists will almost certainly challenge the\n\nNuffield team\'s report to see if the interpretation bears scrutiny, some\n\nastronomers said that the evidence provided by Bailes, Lyne and Shemar\n\nappears convincing.\n " It is the strongest piece of substantive evidence that our\n\nSolar System is not unique,"  Delaney said.\n For his part, Gordon Walker, a professor of astronomy at the\n\nUniversity of British Columbia, said that the use of a radio telescope in the\n\nNuffield experiments was similar to being caught speeding by a policeman\'s\n\nradar gun.\n " It is very hard to argue with him when that number appears\n\non the screen,"  Walker said.\n Still, Lyne said that it was too early to regard his team\'s findings\n\nas conclusive.\n he\n\nsaid. \n " But there may just be something else going on with that\n\npulsar."   \n\n  If the Nuffield results are verified, the discovery will confront\n\nastronomers with new questions.\n Walker said that the presence of the planet next to a pulsar\n\nchallenges the commonly held belief that a star\'s planetary system would be\n\nwiped out by the catastrophic explosion of a supernova, which creates a\n\npulsar.\n And even if it did survive, many astronomers say that the explosion\n\nshould have knocked the planet out of its almost perfectly circular orbit.\n But Walker said that it was possible that the planet could have been\n\nformed by the debris from the host star\'s supernova, which occurred about one\n\nmillion years ago.\n " That is not much time to allow a planet to\n\nform out of the debris."  \n\n  As scientists studied the Nuffield findings, Lyne, Shemar and\n\nBailes said that they planned to do new experiments.\n Lyne said that there is some evidence suggesting that PSR1829-10 may\n\nhave more than one planet.\n But he added that it could take up to 10 years to determine whether\n\nthere are other planets.\n " It\'s an exciting concept that our Solar System is not\n\nunique,"  he said. \n " It gives us another step forward in projecting our\n\nimaginations into outer space."  \n Clearly, if the theory advanced by Lyne and his colleagues is\n\ncorrect, many more astronomical horizons remain to be crossed. \n\n\n  Planet X is an orbiting object that astronomers say they have\n\nlocated near a distant pulsar, or neutron star.\n It may be the first planet to be located outside of Earth\'s Solar\n\nSystem.\n The pulsar, which is about 30,000 light years from the solar system\n\nof which Earth is a part, is located near the centre of the Milky Way.\n Planet X apparently orbits at about the same distance from the pulsar\n\nas the planet Venus does from the Sun.\n Unlike planets in Earth\'s Solar System, Planet X is much larger than\n\nits sun.\n The dense pulsar rotates at speeds of up to 1,000 revolutions per\n\nsecond. \n\n  ILLUSTRATION: Photo: UBC astronomer Walker: after years of\n\nfruitless effort, an irregular pattern of pulses Chart ( Online): The Milky\n\nWay   \n\n\n\n\n  As experts increasingly recognize the worldwide nature of\n\npollution and other environmental hazards, many scientists say that they have\n\nbecome convinced that the problem must be studied on a global basis.\n As a result, the Washington-based National Aeronautics and Space\n\nAdministration is currently developing six 15-ton satellites, which would be\n\nthe largest unmanned spacecraft ever launched by the United States, in order\n\nto study climate patterns and environmental change from space.\n Called the Earth Observing System ( EOS), the 15-year project,\n\nestimated to cost &dollar;35 billion, will gather data continuously on such\n\ndiverse phenomena as polar ice, tropical storms and atmospheric pollutants,\n\nbeginning in 1998.\n Scientists say that they hope the data will lead to important new\n\ndiscoveries about subjects ranging from tropical rain-forest destruction to\n\nPrairie wheat yields.\n Said James Drummond, a University of Toronto physicist who is\n\ndesigning an instrument for the project:  " We need an integrated set\n\nof measurements to understand the continuity of climate change." \n\n\n\n  The elaborate EOS satellites will collect enough information on\n\nthe Earth\'s environment every day to fill the memories of 50,000 personal\n\ncomputers.\n Advocates of the project also maintain that the data will vastly\n\nimprove the accuracy of assessing environmental problems, leading to possible\n\nscientific solutions.\n Since NASA proposed the project in 1988, hundreds of scientists from\n\nmore than 15 countries, including Canada, have begun designing equipment that\n\nmay eventually be used on the satellites.\n Said Gordon McBean, a University of British Columbia climatologist\n\nwho is regarded as a world authority on climate change:  " We need a\n\nmassive global experiment like EOS to deal with the Earth as a system."\n\n \n\n  But other scientists claim that megaprojects like EOS consume too\n\nmuch research money and talent.\n Andrew Lacis, a New York City-based climatologist with the Goddard\n\nInstitute for Space Studies, said that an entire scientific discipline can\n\nsuffer when a megaproject fails to perform according to expectations.\n He noted that NASA\'s &dollar;1.85-billion Hubble Space Telescope,\n\nlaunched in April, will take three more years to achieve its design potential\n\nbecause the main mirror has failed to focus accurately the light that strikes\n\nit from outer space.\n " Megaprojects have a way of slipping and being\n\ndelayed and going wrong."  \n\n  So far, the scientific community has supported NASA\'s proposal to\n\nhave EOS in operation in eight years.\n If that happens, there will eventually be two satellites always in\n\nnorth-south orbit around the Earth at an altitude of nearly 440 miles.\n Each spacecraft will pass near the poles once a day, and some of its\n\ninstruments will gather data across a 700-mile-wide swath of the Earth\'s\n\nsurface.\n The first satellite will probably monitor changes in vegetation, ice\n\ncover and precipitation, while the second, scheduled for launching before the\n\nyear 2000, would measure such natural phenomena as continental drift,\n\natmospheric ozone levels, wind speeds and temperatures. \n\n  Canadian scientists have eagerly joined the competition to design\n\nequipment that could be used on board the satellites or as ground-based\n\nsupport.\n The U of T\'s Drummond is developing an instrument to measure carbon\n\nmonoxide and methane, two atmospheric gases that may be important factors in\n\nclimate change.\n Drummond said that the instrument is among 20 being designed for use\n\non the first satellite.\n He added that NASA plans to select 12 to 16 devices by the end of\n\nthis month.\n Meanwhile, the Ottawa-based Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, a\n\nbranch of Energy, Mines and Resources, is leading several global-change\n\nstudies that incorporate and interpret the data collected from EOS.\n Said Barry Goodison, co-ordinator of space programs at Environment\n\nCanada\'s Canadian Climate Centre, and one of 35 Canadian scientists involved\n\nin the studies:  " We see this as an opportunity to push Canada into\n\nmore Earth observation research."  \n\n  Many scientists say that EOS could lead to international action\n\non global pollution.\n Ellsworth LeDrew, a University of Waterloo, Ont., geography professor\n\nwho is involved in the Canada Climate Centre\'s studies, said that scientists\n\nmust provide a clearer understanding of the extent and causes of\n\nenvironmental damage before governments can be expected to take co-ordinated\n\naction.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL',

{'text': 'TORONTO - International Data Corp. ( Canada) Ltd. ( IDC) has\n\ncompleted a survey of user operating system software support needs and\n\nexpectations. \n\n  1990 Canadian User Satisfaction with\n\nSoftware Support  survey is to let vendors know how successful they are\n\nin the eyes of customers.\n Vendors can compare customer satisfaction ratings in 1990 to those\n\nfrom the  1989 Canadian User Satisfaction with Software Support\n\n survey to discover where they have made progress and where they should\n\nconcentrate their efforts in the upcoming year. \n\n  It is apparent customers still expect total service from a\n\nsoftware service provider, based on average importance ratings of individual\n\nsoftware support criteria.\n\n\n  &bullet; Overall support and quality control of software received\n\nwere deemed the most important initial support criteria. \n\n  &bullet; The ease of reporting a problem and receiving\n\nongoing feedback on the status of a problem / solution were rated\n\nthe most significant criteria of telephone support. \n\n  &bullet; The ability to provide permanent fixes, quality of\n\nupdates / revisions and their ease of installation, and the ability to\n\nprovide workarounds were all judged as equally important ongoing support\n\ncriteria. \n\n  &bullet; The ease of maintenance and quality of remote\n\ndiagnostics were rated as the most significant additional services. \n\n  One industry trend observed is that vendors, for the most part,\n\nare not meeting customer expectations in regards to callback times in\n\nboth emergencies and under normal circumstances. \n\n  Hewlett-Packard is the only software support provider meeting its\n\n average acceptable callback times in emergencies and\n\nunder normal circumstances.\n In fact, average callback times under normal circumstances have\n\nincreased; only Hewlett-Packard and NCR achieved decreases in their average\n\ncallback times under normal circumstances since 1989.\n However, average callback times in emergencies have decreased;\n\nonly IBM and Bull achieved increases in their average callback times in\n\nemergencies since 1989.\n Vendors are concentrating too much on quicker responses in emergen\n\n<l> cies to the neglect of their response time under normal cir <l>\n\ncumstances. \n\n  performance\n\nare included in the report.\n Vendors assessed include Bull, Digital, Hewlett-Packard, IBM,\n\nNCR, and Unisys. \n\n  1990 Canadian User\n\nSatisfaction with Software Support  survey, contact Mark Pel <l>\n\nlettier at ( 416) 369-0033.  \n\n\n Win over friends, neighbors with community marketing\n\n \n\n\n  Common sense dictates that some of your most important business\n\ncomes from buyers in your area.\n But according to Tracy Groves, marketing manager for Concord,\n\nOnt.-based Computer Brokers of Canada ( CBC), too many dealers overlook their\n\nown backyard when it comes to planning a marketing campaign.\n " Community-based marketing is vastly underutilized,"\n\n she says. \n " Dealers have to be shown just how cost-effective it can\n\nbe."   \n\n  There are several good reasons to act locally when it comes\n\nto your overall marketing strategy.\n\n\n  " For anything other than a local campaign, the costs\n\nwill just destroy you,"  says Robert Cohen, president of The Cohen\n\nGroup, an integrated marketing/advertising firm in Richmond Hill,\n\nOnt. \n\n  It\'s also a chance for you to differentiate yourself from the\n\ncompetition, using the hometeam advantage, or " buy local" mentality to\n\nyour benefit.\n Over the long haul, it\'s a chance for you to generate goodwill - to\n\nestablish that your firm is a good corporate citizen.\n\n\nsumer\'s trust gets the sales. \n\n  Not all businesses can approach community-based marketing\n\nthe same way.\n The vehicles you choose depend on who your customers are, says\n\nGroves.\n " Community marketing is especially important if you\n\nserve the retail customer,"  she says.\n Buying a computer represents a big investment - and a major risk -\n\nfor most, so building trust and credibility over time is important. \n\n  The scope of your campaign also depends on your size.\n\n\ning campaign, says Groves, but one-man shops may have to settle for\n\nbus-shelter ads outside the store. \n\n  Finally, location plays a big part in how you stage your\n\ncampaign.\n In major centres, says Cohen, it\'s critical to establish\n\nyourself as a specialist in some area - say, networking or peripherals.\n In smaller communities, where you\'re up against a handful of\n\ncompetitors, you want to establish yourself as an expert in all areas.\n\n\n\n \n\niar.\n CBC\'s Groves points to local print and radio advertising as two of\n\nthe most common ways dealers reach out to their neighbors.\n " Community newspapers are extremely well-read outside\n\nmajor centres like Toronto,"  agrees Cohen.\n\n\nnies on tight budgets, he says, spots on local cable channels can be highly\n\ncost-effective. \n\n \n\nmouth, N.S., is a firm believer in the power of local print media.\n He and partner Roy Drinnan advertise regularly in the monthly paper\n\nthat goes to the 2,000 neighbors in their industrial park. \n\n  " One of our target markets is small and mid-sized busi\n\n<l> ness,"  says Dexter,  " and the majority of them fit the\n\nprofile." \n Basys pays between &dollar;300 and &dollar;400 for an ad in the\n\nmonthly  Burnside News  , and Dexter says the campaign plays an im\n\n<l> portant part in the firm\'s efforts to overcome price competition from\n\ndealers in Toronto. \n\n  Local business and community associations offer another way\n\nto reinforce your hometeam advantage.\n Time, of course, is a limiting factor, says Cohen, and the extent of\n\nyour personal involvement has to balance against potential returns:\n\n " You need to get your name known in the community without taking up\n\na lot of your time."  \n\n  Membership in a local Chamber of Commerce is a good way to start.\n\n\n\n  Isaac Ehrlich, owner of Richmond Hill, Ont.-based laptop and\n\nperipheral reseller Keysoft Network Inc., belongs to three local Chambers.\n " tell Chamber members who we are and what we\n\nare,"  says Keysoft general manager Barbara Smith,  " and\n\nthat\'s reinforced when we attend local functions.\n Most of these people really make an effort to buy local."\n\n \n\n  The networking paid off recently when Keysoft landed a deal\n\nto sell 10 laptops to the municipality of Vaughn, north of Toronto.\n The deal came about when Ehrlich, who lives in Vaughn, met with a\n\nmunicipal representative at a recent Chamber meeting. \n\n  Event marketing - hosting events ranging from wine-and-cheese\n\nopen houses to champagne-splashed product launches - has become increas <l>\n\ningly popular in recent years, says CBC\'s Groves.\n Event marketing can work very well, she says, particularly in the\n\ncomputer industry. \n " Because it\'s a very technical business, you need to show\n\npeople a human face when you get them in the door."   \n\n \n\nblasé\'  about events over the past couple of years, simply because\n\nthere are so many of them.\n As a result, businesses are having to go to even greater lengths to\n\ndraw a crowd.\n and no one\'ll show up.\n Then you find out that Joe down the street held one last week, and he\n\nhad champagne and you only had beer - you get into that sort of competition,"\n\n she says. \n\n  One response, says Groves, has been for smaller firms to pool\n\ntheir resources and stage " mini trade shows."\n Renting space in a local hotel or meeting hall, a group can set\n\nup booths and invite members of the local community to browse and partake of\n\nfood and drink.  \n With the combined muscle - and budget - of a number of firms, says\n\nGroves, mini trade shows offer one way to get your name in front of local\n\nbuyers. \n\n  Direct mail offers a very precise way to carry your message\n\nto the people who count.\n You can buy lists from list brokers, local associations like your\n\nChamber of Commerce, or even church and community groups. \n\n  Roland Lau, owner of Calgary\'s The Home Computing Centre\n\nInc., used postal code data to send flyers to 40,000 households in his\n\nimmediate area.\n\n\ntribute a specific increase in sales to the effort, he will say the mailing\n\nincreased his visibility. \n\n  When it comes to competition, says Lau, dealers have two\n\nchoices:  " You can be the biggest, or you can be closest to your\n\ncommunity." \n Lau estimates that more than 70 per cent of sales come from\n\nbuyers within a 10-kilometre radius of his retail outlet. \n\n  Depending on the size of your company, outdoor advertising\n\ncan be a good way to keep in touch with your community.\n But both Groves and Cohen warn that, like any advertising,\n\nbillboards, bus shelters and taxi tops only work if the ads emphasize some\n\nunique selling point. \n\n  if\n\nyou can afford it, and can play up some unique selling feature - if you\'ve\n\ngot an exclusive on a product, for example,"  says Groves. \n " Everyone\'s got basically the same bill of goods, so\n\nyou have to focus on what you do better."   \n\n  Whether your community marketing campaign pays off in direct\n\nsales today, or paves the way for tomorrow\'s orders, the push to act locally\n\nremains the same: developing a relationship based on trust. \n\n  " Being a good corporate citizen is very important,\n\nespecially when you\'re talking about a technical business like\n\ncomputers,"  says Groves. \n " When you build that association with the community, they (\n\nlocal buyers) get to know you and trust you.\n That\'s what IBM did - everyone trusts IBM, and look where they are\n\ntoday."    \n\n\n\n\n\n  How many software companies with an excellent product that meet a\n\nreal demand remain virtually invisible despite their technical\n\nexpertise? \n\n  In Quebec, the number is far too high, according to Yvon Blais,\n\nmanager of the Quebec computer sector for the Ministry of Industry,\n\nScience, and Technology. \n\n  The problem is lack of marketing expertise, and many, including\n\nBlais, hope that the recently established Centre de Promotion du Logi <l>\n\nciel Québécois ( CPLQ) will address this concern. \n\n  The centre, which began operations in September 1990, is a\n\nnon-profit organization funded by the federal Department of\n\nCommunications and the provincial Ministry of Communications. \n\n  The ministries are contributing &dollar;200,000 and\n\n&dollar;400,000 respectively over a period of two years, after which\n\ntime the centre expects to be self supporting. \n\n  As the name implies, the centre aims to promote the\n\ncommercialization of Quebec software. \n\n \n\ntion by inviting the CPLQ to co-sponsor a fall workshop that prepared Quebec\n\ncompanies for Comdex. \n\n  According to Mich&egrave;le Guay, general director of the CPLQ,\n\nthe Comdex workshop was the first of many that the centre plans to be\n\ninvolved in. \n\n  " Within a few months we expect to be hosting one work\n\n<l> shop per month and one showcase per week,"  said Guay. \n\n  Showcases, held in the centre\'s Montreal showroom, will allow\n\nsoftware producers to present products to prospective clients and\n\ndistributors. \n\n  Guay\'s strategy for achieving the centre\'s goal is two-fold.\n On the home front, she intends to help Quebec software producers\n\nfully exploit their local markets.\n As part of this effort, the CPLQ will try to get large Quebec\n\ncompanies to consider locally developed software before turning to the\n\nUnited States or elsewhere.\n Guay believes a strong local base gives companies a real advantage in\n\nthe international market. \n\n  The CPLQ also has projects underway for companies targeting\n\nmarkets outside of the province.\n The centre plans to collaborate on a national marketing network for\n\neducational and training software. \n\n \n\ntions Canada, has organized a symposium for April in Vancouver.\n At that time, groups from across Canada will meet with Dubitsky and\n\nB.C. Tel to discuss implementation. \n\n  According to Dubitsky, the CPLQ is the only centre of its kind\n\nin Canada right now.\n They were the obvious choice to represent Quebec in the cour\n\n<l> seware network. \n\n  The CPLQ is also collaborating on a plan to give 10 Quebec\n\ncompanies a boost into the international market.\n The companies will benefit from the expertise of a\n\nmarketing firm and the involvement of government agencies.\n For the relatively low cost of &dollar;5,000, the firms will be\n\nhelped to launch an international campaign. \n\n  The CPLQ intends to play an important role as a focus for\n\ninformation about what is available to software producers and\n\ndistributors.\n " We want to be the hub of a net work made up of producers,\n\ndistributors, buyers, associations, and government agencies\n\ninvolved in the Quebec software industry,"  explained Guay. \n\n  Many software producers feel a dire need for just such an\n\ninformation centre.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b107b0f4-2487-4184-a0ba-7fc41c25078a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.848277+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9614535570144653, 'non_english_score': 0.03854644298553467}
{'text': 'So you\'ve decided on Unix.\n\n\n  You\'re probably letting your hardware decide for you.\n After all, the vendor of hardware will likely belong to one of two\n\ngroups, Unix International ( UI) or the Open Software Foundation ( OSF). \n\n  Maybe you\'ll let the software or the application determine\n\nwhich choice you make.\n Don\'t count on it.\n Most software firms are hedging their bets by, at least for now,\n\ncommitting to both the UI and OSF groups.\n ( See story, for example, Computer Associates commits to Unix, p. 21).\n\n\n\n  But why not try this test?\n\n\n  Why do we raise this question now?\n It has to do with the great momentum behind open systems and the\n\ncontinuing uncertainty around other operating systems.\n ( See stories, p.1).\n Open systems may yet force the issue between which version of Unix\n\nwill emerge as the standard. \n\n  Not surprisingly, David Sandel, vice-president of marketing, Unix\n\nInternational has stated that he sees  " Unix System V as the base of\n\nopen systems."  \n\n  What this talk does is set up a confrontation by turning the road\n\nto open systems into a collision course for competing versions of Unix. \n\n  If everybody wants open systems, it stands to reason that they\n\nwill only want one version of an open system.\n And if they only want one version of open systems that is based on\n\nUnix, then one of the two is sure to face extinction. \n\n  It\'s too early to tell if users will go the UI or the OSF route.\n Nor do we have any way of knowing if one of the two versions is\n\ntechnically superior to the other. \n\n  But the hype around open systems seems to have the effect of\n\nforcing this issue earlier than we expected.\n Users should look now for signs of one version dominating the other.\n\n\n\n  The early returns place UI\'s version in front.\n Said AT&T Canada\'s Benjamin Scott at the recent Open Systems show in\n\nOttawa:  " By the end of 1990, more than 300 companies were shipping\n\nproducts based on System V release 4 platforms. \n With those kind of numbers, the UI version has the best chance of\n\nbecoming the standard around which open systems will flourish.  "\n\n \n\n  In contrast, users, as IBM and others have done, should raise\n\nsome serious concerns about AT&T\'s ownership of Unix System V. (\n Although, it should be noted that AT&T is negotiating to sell off as\n\nmuch of the 40 per cent of its Unix operating system). \n\n  If an open system is all about being non-proprietary, users may\n\nyet look to the OSF for direction. \n\n\n \n\nwelcomes another monthly columnist in this issue ( see p. 40).\n Clyde Boom, director of technical services for Lancom Technologies, a\n\nToronto-based computer services firm, will contribute a LANs (\n\nLocal-Area Networks) column from a training and systems integration\n\nperspective.    \n\n\n\n\n Paul Swinwood is president, Learning Tree International, a\n\nGloucester, Ont.-based firm that specializes in telecommunications,\n\nsoftware and management training. \n\n  Times are tough out there.\n Sales managers are reporting lost sales, production managers are\n\nreporting low backlogs, CEOs are warning of layoffs and controllers are\n\ncalling for cutting expenses. \n\n  What can a manager do?\n First no travel, no training, no more giveaways - cut expenses.\n\n\n  That solution may be too simple.\n A leading edge, competitive company, however, will continue\n\nto spend on two major areas during a recession: future projects and future\n\nproductivity. \n\n \n\nnually and focus on products, productivity and most importantly, people.\n\n\n\n \n\nnificantly as our clients freeze spending.\n In our experience, the major successful players in the technology\n\nfields react well to market pressures and then focus on the resources\n\navailable. \n\n \n &bullet; review your current product and procedures for short-term\n\nproductivity gains.\n Can better training improve productivity of the staff;\n &bullet; review your development needs.\n Could training cut development costs and time required to bring\n\nyour newest product to the market quicker and gain a market edge; and,\n &bullet; review your staff needs.\n\n\nment to weather these tough times?\n Most training can be brought to your location.\n You save on travel, staff availability costs and gain productivity im\n\n<l> mediately because the training is focused on your environment and needs.\n Tough times call for tough measures, but the wise manager recognizes\n\ntraining remains important.  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Mark Skapinker is a co-founder and president of Delrina\n\nTechnology Inc. \n\n  He is credited with helping to define and to promote the forms\n\nprocessing market through his participation in product innovation and a\n\nnumber of industry engagements.\n Under his direction, Delrina\'s PerForm software has garnered a number\n\nof industry awards. \n\n  Prior to Delrina, he was director of product development for\n\nBatteries Included, before its acquisition by Electronic Arts. \n\n  He has a post-graduate diploma in computer science from the\n\nUniversity of Jerusalem. \n\n  editor Martin\n\nSlofstra at Delrina\'s head office in Toronto.  \n\n\n  Delrina Technology Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of\n\nToronto-based Delrina Corp. and is recognized as a leading supplier of\n\nPC-based graphics forms processing software.\n\n\n  Other subsidiaries of Delrina are Carolian Systems ( data centre\n\nmanagement systems for HP 3000) and a 51 per cent share of SoftPort\n\nTechnologies, distributors of accounting software. \n\n  In April 1990, IBM Canada Ltd. acquired a 11 per cent stake,\n\nrepresenting the first such investment by IBM in a Canadian software company.\n\n\n\n  Delrina Corp. also has offices in Ottawa, Los Gatos, Calif.,\n\nWashington D.C. and England.\n Revenues for the period ending June 30, 1990 were &dollar;8.1\n\nmillion, up from &dollar;5.0 million the year before.  \n\n\n\n \n CC: How would you define forms processing and what does it include?\n\n \n\n  Skapinker: Forms processing is basically the computerization of\n\nforms.\n It takes parts of many other technologies and brings them all\n\ntogether.\n In other words, it takes the printing, WYSIWYG ( What You See Is What\n\nYou Get) and complete page layout aspects of desktop publishing, the database\n\ndata entry elements from database, printing technology, font technology\n\nand it also includes communications. \n\n \n\ncessing function?  \n\n  Skapinker: I think it depends on the size of the organization.\n What we\'ve done is we\'ve split our product line completely down the\n\nmiddle.\n So we have regular PerForm, which is really aimed at the entry-level\n\nor smaller business, where it\'s the owner-operator or the administrative\n\npeople who look after the forms.\n Then we\'ve got our PerForm Pro, which is really aimed at the high-end\n\nof the marketplace. \n\n  Certain companies may have a forms department.\n The administrative people may look after it, and often, the\n\nfinancial people look after it.\n Certainly the MIS people look after only a certain kind of form.\n However, it\'s the senior managers beyond the individual\n\ndepartments, who really see the hidden cost of forms and the advantage of\n\nforms processing. \n\n  CC: Are organizations starting to integrate their forms pro\n\n<l> cessing function with their overall information strategy?  \n\n  Skapinker: Very much so.\n There is no need to fill in a form on paper and then re-enter the\n\ndata in afterwards.\n It makes absolute sense to be building the form into an existing\n\nnetwork of machines or communication of machines, get the data in,\n\nbe able to use it anywhere within the organization, and of course, get\n\nrid of a lot of the waste. \n\n  Why keep writing your name and address on 50 different forms when\n\nyou only really need to update your address once and it will appear on any\n\nother forms? \n\n  CC: Forms processing is one application that is said to be\n\nideal for client / server applications.\n\n\n  Skapinker: If you ever look at the type of money that people are\n\ncurrently spending on paper forms, it starts becoming far more realistic.\n\n\n\n  There\'s huge costs based in terms of processing a form.\n The cost of processing a form, compared to the cost of printing\n\na paper form is about 50 or 60 to one.\n So for every dollar that you spend on buying a paper form, you spend\n\n&dollar;60 on processing that form. \n\n  For years, we heard about how the industry had managed to\n\ncomputerize itself, and small office functionality had been able to\n\ncomputerize itself, yet when it came to the large overall management of an\n\noffice, it has never been able to get computerized.\n It\'s really quite interesting to have a look why this has never\n\nhappened. \n\n  A lot of this is that the hardware hasn\'t been there.\n You need the graphics hardware, you need laser printers, you need\n\nnetworks, you need a database which exists out there on a client/server\n\nbasis. \n\n  With that all in place, we now have the ability to pull all this\n\ntogether and actually computerize the communications between individuals\n\nin an office, which is forms processing.\n I think the opportunity is enormous in terms of real live users and\n\nthe application of form processing in the office. \n\n  CC: So electronic mail, for example, could be done in the\n\nway of forms when you introduce a large enough user base? \n\n \n\ntronic mail.\n When I go on a business trip and I come back and I fill in an\n\nexpense form, I want one copy to go to my manager who is going to sign it\n\noff.  \n\n  My manager, once he\'s signed it off, will probably send it\n\nthrough to the accounting department who will generate a cheque and send that\n\ncheque back to me.\n I don\'t think of that as electronic mail.\n I think of that as the routing and the processing of the form\n\nthat I\'ve just filled in. \n\n  When I\'ve sat with an employee and gone through an employee\n\nevaluation process, and I file that away in their file, I don\'t think of that\n\nas mail or database.\n I just think of it as, well I\'ve now written this form and I\'ve\n\nfilled this in, let\'s put it away. \n\n  One of the big advantages of form processing is it gets rid of\n\nall the jargon of having to update your database, electronically send a piece\n\nof information from one person to another and put it in terms that people\n\nunderstand. \n\n \n\nmate your business because it\'s what people can relate to?  \n\n  Skapinker: It\'s proven.\n\n\nlate to a means of communication. \n\n  Part of the difficulty is that people on the entry-level, com\n\n<l> puter level really are looking for a means of communicating and using\n\ncomputers.\n When they really got into word processing, which is what a lot\n\nof them do, it really just replaced the type-writer. \n\n  Why is WordPerfect the most popular word processor?\n\n\n  CC: Forms processing is a hot market for you now.\n But what do you to do for an encore and how do you avoid becoming a\n\none product company?

{'text': 'In our organization, we have two facets to our computing function.\n\n\n\n  On one side there are those hired to develop applications -\n\nthey are programmer / analysts in the traditional sense.\n The other side is there to support our expanding base of PC users.\n\n\n  The last time I checked, both groups were running around\n\nfuriously.\n I\'m not sure why but it must of had to do something with\n\nmission-critical applications, whatever that is. \n\n  The reason for my concern is I needed something done.\n I wanted a certain kind of software loaded on my machine.\n It\'s not a big request but I suppose it ranks about number 112 on\n\ntheir list of priorities. \n\n  At our company, there is probably an argument for having two\n\ngroups responsible for our systems.\n\n\n  But where the whole systems breaks down is this growing list of\n\nunmet end-user requests. \n\n  A co-worker needs a modem installed so she can work at home.\n Another fellow wants to upgrade his PC with a color monitor.\n A third is having troubles with a hard drive.\n And to top it off, I have a boss who can produce a one-inch thick\n\nstack of printed e-mail messages each representing a request to the PC\n\nsupport supervisor. \n\n  These are requests that I know of, these are the ones from our\n\ndepartment.\n Now multiply that by all the other users in all the other departments\n\nand what you have is a rather large backlog. \n\n  Our IS function, such that it is, simply is facing more demands\n\nthan it can satisfy.\n And it is, however undeserved, getting a reputation for\n\nunresponsiveness. \n\n  I\'m told, many, if not most organizations, are experiencing\n\nsimilar frustrations. \n\n  My concern is that IS has been so preoccupied with " serving"\n\nothers, aiming to please but forgetting all that is promised, that I, typical\n\nend-user, have become reluctant to add to their list. \n\n  So what do you do?\n The obvious answer is to add more resources and more people.\n\n\n  A second would be to make users more self-sufficient but I\'m\n\nafraid co-workers would resist any attempt to be transformed into " techies."\n\n\n\n  A third is to involve end-users more in the judicious use of\n\nresources that always seem to be limited and to help our technical people set\n\npriorities. \n\n  I think that maybe our computer department, or any IS\n\norganization, would be better off if it was run like a business. \n\n  This does not at all imply that you want to turn IS into a profit\n\ncentre.\n But what it means is doing a better job of telling your IS personnel\n\nexactly what is you do to make money - so they can discern between "\n\nstrategic" use of their time and what is a meaningless digression. \n\n  And it means accountability, to other departments and to upper\n\nmanagement, and depending on your type of business, to customers or suppliers\n\nas well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  After a turbulent 18 months beginning with the accumulation of\n\n&dollar;575 million ( U.S.) in debt, Wang Laboratories, one of the most\n\nsuccessful proprietary vendors of the  , has a new\n\nstrategy - it wants to be liked. \n\n  " We got away from trying to be known to a core base of\n\ncustomers, and we just used our name to get to everybody who wanted word\n\nprocessing,"  admits acting president of Wang Canada, Vaughn\n\nMcIntyre. \n\n  Most of the Fortune 1000 companies in Canada have at one time or\n\nanother dealt with Toronto-based Wang.\n However, the company\'s focus was on the computer marketplace rather\n\nthan on the customer.\n\n\n  " We tended to have advertisements that other computer com\n\n<l> panies would understand and know but that our customers wouldn\'t.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Regaining people\'s trust is central to Wang\'s new strategy.\n\n\nships but confesses:  " Over a five-or six-year period, not unlike\n\nsome of our competitors, we do have to admit to having built up excellent\n\npartnerships and then destroyed them with the stroke of a policy change."\n\n \n\n  At the end of 1989 Wang Canada\'s parent company, Wang\n\nLaboratories Inc. of Lowell, Mass., found itself in debt to the tune of\n\n&dollar;575 million ( U.S.).\n said\n\nMcIntyre.\n Restructuring the business appears to have paid off - Wang\n\nreported a very small profit in the first quarter of ended Sept. 30, 1991,\n\nand is hoping to build on that, although, as McIntyre is aware, \n\n" it\'s going to be touch and go for a while."  \n\n  McIntyre attributes the turn-around to the refinement of Wang\'s\n\nbusiness internally and not to the response of its customers.\n " I would not want to trick anybody into thinking that people\n\nhave flocked to our door and begun to buy just because we\'ve cleaned up our\n\nact,"  he said. \n\n\n  At Wang Canada, there have been major changes: director of\n\nmarketing McIntyre had to step into the shoes of president Steve Trotter, who\n\nreturned to his home country New Zealand four months ago.\n " Big disappointment for him, because he was the basis\n\nfor some of the changes we\'d made here," said McIntyre. \n\n\n\n\n  Changes include a focus on open standards and a push towards the\n\nimage processing market.\n Wang Canada has just announced Open/image for Netware, which\n\nintegrates document image processing into Novell\'s Netware 386 network\n\noperating system, and Open/image-Windows 3.0, a new release of its image pro\n\n<l> cessing software for 286, 386 and 486-based PCs. \n\n \n\nware and software, said McIntyre,  " and that was a significant\n\nwin for us.\n\n\n  The company has established an imaging centre in Winnipeg, in\n\nconjunction with the government of Manitoba, and is developing a\n\ndocument processing package called Upward, which will incorporate\n\nWindows 3.0.\n " heaven forbid, on\n\none of the other products like WordPerfect,"  which can be\n\ntransferred back and forth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  Take one film producer, a stockbroker and a software package\n\ndeveloped by church-going computer wizards in New York and you have Canadian\n\nInterlinear Technology Inc. \n\n  If this sounds a little bizarre, so is the story of how this\n\nWillowdale, Ont.-based company and its flagship product, MEDIS, came into\n\nexistence. \n\n  Founder of Canadian Interlinear Technology Angus Sullivan, an\n\nIrish Canadian, used to be in the film business.\n Last July, on a visit to New York, Sullivan encountered a friend from\n\nchurch who had the documentation to a new software package called MEDIS. \n\n  " He said, \'This is some technology some friends of mine\n\nand some people in the church have developed, and would you like to see what\n\nyou can do with it in Canada?\' "  recounted Sullivan.\n " I said, \'What do I know about computers?\'\n\n\n \n " I thought to myself, \'They tell me in New York that this\n\nis hot, hot, hot but what do I know?\n How can I find out?\n\n\n  He attempted to interest investors, including one who had backed\n\nsome of his films, but was told the same thing: go and see some people in the\n\nbusiness and talk to end-users.\n\n\n  So Sullivan went to Boeing, Spar Aerospace, GE Aerospace and\n\nLitton Systems.\n He knew he had hit upon something after he left the manual with one\n\nof the technical experts at Litton,  " because when I came back he was\n\ncaressing the manual.\n I thought he was about to have some weird perverse type of\n\nrelationship,"  Sullivan recalled. \n " I thought, \'There must be something in this manual;\' as an\n\nIrishman I can judge passion rather well."   \n\n  MEDIS ( Modular Electronic Document Image System) is a document\n\nimage system with an open, client-server-based architecture that consists of\n\nseven software modules designed to run on Unix platforms.\n It is compliant with the Computer-aided Acquisition and Support (\n\nGALS) initiative specified as a requirement by the U.S. Department of\n\nDefense for future defence contracts, which is why Interlinear is initially\n\ntargeting the aerospace industry.\n\n\n  Sullivan showed the product to a chief engineer for one of the\n\nmajor aircraft manufacturers who, while impressed by MEDIS, was  "\n\nabsolutely terrified of the technology because it\'s his responsibility to\n\nbring his company into that kind of thing."  \n\n  " having been in the film business a long\n\ntime you get your hopes up a lot, and you get  smashed a lot,"\n\n Sullivan contacted his cousin, Robert Angus German, founder of Geac\n\nComputer, who pronounced MEDIS  " awesome"  and advised\n\nSullivan to recruit  " some super-technotron"  to sell the\n\nsoftware. \n\n  On the strength of this another cousin, Clive Sullivan, quit his\n\njob as a stockbroker at Hector Chisholm & Co. in Toronto to sell the MEDIS\n\npackage and finance the start-up of Canadian Interlinear Technology, along\n\nwith " an old friend-of-the-family-type," W.K. Buckley Ltd. \n\n  The company was incorporated on Feb. 1 this year and the\n\nSullivans have exclusive Canadian rights to the MEDIS technology as well as\n\nan option on 10 per cent of the American company, Interlinear Technology.\n\n\n\n  The main problem, ( Angus) Sullivan admits, is the long lead time\n\nbetween starting up a business and selling your first unit,  " which\n\nis a long way down the line; so, basically, this is not the type of\n\ninvestment that brokers would advise."  \n\n  Still, it helps to have relatives in the right places.\n And Sullivan has a lot of them.\n " When the Irish Catholics got to Canada centuries ago they\n\nwere like rabbits in carrot heaven, so they just went through the place and\n\nate everything and reproduced randomly all over.\n\n\n\n Help desk professionals ask for a little respect\n\n  \n\n\n\n  TORONTO - In its first meeting, the Toronto chapter of the\n\nHelp Desk Institute got off the ground in what it hopes will become a forum\n\nfor help desk and customer service professionals. \n\n  " Over the years help desk professionals have implemented\n\ntechnology but it\'s never been truly successful.\n At times we aren\'t even able to articulate the needs of our industry.\n That\'s why we\'re here, to share our experiences and build from\n\nthem,"  says Terry Garbutt, technical product support consultant for\n\nthe City of Toronto. \n\n  " People within our industry are never given the proper\n\nrecognition they deserve.\n We need a forum to address the problems and concerns facing help\n\ndesk professionals.\n We didn\'t want to create another \'me-too\' organization.\n\n\n  The chapter was formed last October and is the first Canadian\n\nchapter for the organization.\n It plans to set up a branch in Calgary later this year.\n The cost to join is &dollar;35 a year for members &dollar;50 per\n\nperson for vendors. \n\n  " We want to give people who work on the front line an\n\nopportunity to participate.\n Usually, it\'s the manager or the technical specialist who attends.\n In this chapter, we\'re hoping to inform everyone from the manager to\n\nthe people who answer the phones,"  says Gabby Winterstein,\n\nmanager of a customer support centre for the Bank of Montreal\'s customer\n\nservices department. \n\n  " We don\'t need to re-invent the wheel.\n We don\'t have to know each other\'s secrets but if a company is doing\n\nsomething right both in terms of procedure and technology, then why not share\n\nit with us.\n he\n\nsays. \n\n  " There are people in our organization just starting a\n\nhelp desk and those who have one of 100 people or more.\n People have a vehicle for getting together and sharing\n\ninformation, both from individuals within their industry and from other\n\nareas,"  Winterstein says. \n\n  The chapter is looking for input from members, and from those\n\ninterested in joining, to get some idea of the issues that future meetings\n\nshould address.\n The next meeting of the Toronto Help Desk Institute will take place\n\nMarch 12. \n\n  For further information, call either Gabby Winterstein at ( 416)\n\n398-8800 or Terry Garbutt at ( 416) 392-7077.  \n\n\n\n\n  of Stratus\n\nComputer INC.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'da5464fe-7573-4eb1-8839-ab933288ccfc', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.850775+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9760128259658813, 'non_english_score': 0.023987174034118652}
{'text': 'photograph  \n\n\n\n  MISSISSAUGA, Ont. - Windows, multimedia and OS/2 will form\n\nthe cornerstone of Microsoft Corp.\'s development efforts during the\n\nnext decade, the company\'s co-founder and chairman says. \n\n  commitment to OS/2 follows a published report\n\nstating that Microsoft planned to abandon an operating system which has\n\ngenerated little interest since its introduction four years ago. \n\n \n\nsaid Gates. \n " We\'ve got more people focused on OS/2 than we ever have.\n Particularly when a product\'s in a position like this, we need to\n\nmake it absolutely clear what our commitment is."   \n\n  He told reporters here prior to the opening of Microsoft Canada\n\nInc.\'s new headquarters, that OS/2 remains the  " highest\n\npriority"  for his company. \n\n  " The story with Windows from 1983 until just a year ago, was\n\nthat people said, \'come on, give up, why are you working on that?\n\n\n  " We had to come back in every speech and say this will\n\nbe important,"  he said. \n " We find ourselves in exactly the same position with OS/2\n\ntoday."   \n\n  And the success of Windows 3.0, the graphical user interface\n\n( GUI) that burst onto the scene last May, has been nothing short of\n\nphenomenal. \n\n  More than two million copies have been sold worldwide since the\n\nintroduction and the number of Windows-based applications has\n\nsoared to 1,000. \n\n \n\n  When asked if Microsoft planned to go head-to-head with\n\nCupertino, CA\'s Apple Computer Inc. as part of a GUI war, he responded by\n\nsaying  " there\'s no doubt that if they rest on their laurels life\n\nwill get tough for them."  \n\n \n\ntosh,"  he said. \n " Windows on the other hand has the advantage of being\n\ncompatible with the majority of PC hardware." \n\n\n  " If you want a portable machine, I can show you 20 that are\n\ngreat Windows machines.\n\n\n\n\n  Gates also denied that as custodian of the DOS operating system,\n\nMicrosoft holds an unfair advantage over other software developers.\n " We\'ve been a developer of operating systems and\n\napplications from the beginning of the company,"  he said. \n\n " There\'s nothing new about this.   \n\n  " If we get an advantage by offering MS-DOS, did it help us in\n\nour applications, did it help us versus Lotus 1-2-3, did it help us versus\n\nWordPerfect? \n\n\n  " stand on its own."\n\n \n\n  he\n\nsaid. \n " I\'m always curious for someone to provide some example\n\nwhere as the provider of DOS and Windows, we get some advantage." \n\n  \n " ...We went to Lotus and begged them to do Windows\n\napplications - actually signed a contract with Mitch Kapor which they later\n\nreneged on; we went to WordPerfect, Ashton-Tate and begged them to do it."\n\n \n\n  " recount how boring\n\nit was to have me come down year after year and say the Microsoft application\n\nstrategy was to focus on Windows."   \n " There were a lot of other people who listened to that\n\nstory - people like Aldus, Corel and Micrografx. ...\n They are seeing the rewards of picking an environment that happened\n\nto succeed."  \n\n  "\n\nconsumer-type applications.\n Encyclopedias, sports, medicine, travel - all of this on a\n\ncompact disc with sound and pictures and you get to choose what information\n\nyou\'re interested in."   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  The 1990 recession has left its mark on the information\n\ntechnology industry despite strong financial showings from some companies for\n\nthe period ended Dec. 31, 1990, say industry analysts. \n\n  According to Andrew Toller, a consultant with The DMR Group Inc.\n\nin Toronto, 1990 was  " overall a bad year for the industry." \n He says despite a few exceptions - relatively small specialized\n\ncompanies and those who made key announcements in 1990 - growth in the\n\nindustry has slowed and he sees no signs of it bouncing back soon. \n\n  International Data Corp. ( Canada) Ltd. ( IDC) based in Toronto\n\nreports,  " ... Demand for information technology is likely to be more\n\ndirectly affected by the general economic climate over the next few years\n\nthan recent history might lead one to expect."  \n\n  According to IDC, the belief that the IT industry is independent\n\nof the overall business cycle is a myth.\n\n\nbuying behavior is highly influenced by the economic climate. \n " Evidence indicates information technology is as much\n\na tar-get of current cost reduction efforts as are other expenses in the\n\norganization...it is reasonable to expect the recession will be a damper on\n\nIT industry demand."   \n\n  Although Willowdale, Ont.-based Evans Research Corp. ( ERC)\n\npredicts IT will  " experience a slightly softer landing\n\nthan the general business environment,"  it too projects slower\n\ngrowth for most segments in 1990 and 1991. \n\n  Trends and Forecasts for the Information\n\nTechnologies Industry  , 1990-1994, ERC expected the software\n\nsegment to grow 15.6 per cent in  and 15.7 per cent in  , down from 16.5 per cent in  .\n The hardware segment was expected to show growth of only 6.3 per cent\n\n( including hardware maintenance) in 1990 compared to 7.5 per cent in 1989.\n \' 89\n\n to 16.9 per cent in  . \n\n  In addition to slowed growth, the industry also experienced\n\nits share of losses.\n Beginning with B.C.\'s Mission Cyrus which stopped production and\n\nlaid off all but a few employees late in the summer of 1990, there were five\n\nno-table failures.\n Canada Remote Systems Inc. went into receivership; Jonas &\n\nErickson Software Technology Inc. was bought by Markham, Ont.\'s Geac Computer\n\nCorp. Ltd. after filing an assignment in bankruptcy; Myrias Research Corp.\n\nlaid off all of its staff and appointed a receiver; and, Tinton Falls,\n\nNJ-based Concurrent Computer Corp. ended the year by letting 90 employees go\n\nas it attempted to ward off a US&dollar;55-million debt. \n\n  Yet financial reports indicate that not all was gloom and\n\ndoom in the industry for 1990. \n\n  Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM Corp. reported a 10.1 per cent increase in\n\nannual revenue in 1990, reaching US&dollar;69 billion.\n Toller attributes the financial success to IBM\'s launch of its\n\n390 architecture which he claims has boosted growth in the already\n\nsaturated mainframe segment of the industry. \n\n  ERC\'s report echoed Toller\'s comments.\n " While IBM is not the only mainframe manufacturer with new\n\nproduct introductions in 1990, it certainly will have the most signifi\n\n<l> cant impact on the high end of the market,"  states Evans. \n\n  Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, WA, also weathered 1990 well.\n The PC software developer reported a 55 per cent increase in revenues\n\nfor the six months ended Dec. 31, 1990, compared to the same period the year\n\nbefore. \n\n  The company\'s performance isn\'t surprising considering\n\nthe increasing demand for Microsoft Windows 3.0.\n A report from Computer Technology Research based in\n\nCharleston, SC, has Windows 3.0 performing well in the short term although it\n\nquestions its long-term impact. \n\n  Riding the wave of the Windows 3.0 announcement was\n\nOttawa-based Corel Systems Corp. with its popular PC presentation\n\npackage CorelDraw, version 2.0.\n The company\'s fourth quarter, ended Nov. 30, 1990, was its best ever\n\nposted with net sales hitting &dollar;12.2 million, an increase of 56 per\n\ncent over 1989\'s fourth quarter.\n Net income for the year was &dollar;7 million compared to &dollar;2.9\n\nmillion in  . \n\n  Toller claims the company\'s success is largely due to the\n\nfact that it was prepared for Windows 3.0 and was able to ride the first\n\nwave of compatible products. \n\n  Houston\'s Compaq Computer Corp. and Cupertino, CA-based\n\nApple Computer Inc. are two PC hardware vendors who performed well in  .\n Compaq\'s net income increased 70 per cent to US&dollar;135\n\nmillion for the fourth quarter compared to US&dollar;79million in 1989.\n Apple recently posted revenues of US&dollar;1.676 billion for its\n\nfirst quarter of fiscal 1991 ended Dec. 28, 1990 - up 12 per cent from\n\nthe year before. \n\n  Toller says Compaq experienced about a 25 per cent growth,\n\nlargely due to successful sales worldwide - specifically in Japan and\n\nAustralia.\n \' 90\n\n in the areas of 386SX-based desktops, notebook PCs and PC systems.\n\n\n\n  Apple attributes its outstanding performance to the\n\nMacintosh Classic released this year with a reduced entry-level price.\n The company claims Macintosh unit shipments have increased by 50\n\nper cent as more first-time users are being attracted by the lower price.\n\n\n\n  And Silicon Graphics Inc. of Mountain View, CA, may have found\n\nits niche.\n Net revenues for the workstation vendor totalled US&dollar;136\n\nmillion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 1990, an increase of 32 per cent\n\nover revenues for the same period a year earlier. \n\n  In its trends and forecasts report, ERC predicted 28 per cent\n\ngrowth in the technical workstation market for 1990 as awareness among users\n\ncontinues to grow.\n The\n\nTop 200 IT Companies  released last year. \n\n  In general, a survey of financial reports shows the\n\nstrongest gains occurring in the hardware segment of the industry:\n\nConner Peripherals Inc. of San Jose, CA, reported a yearly net income of\n\nUS&dollar;130.1 million, up 213 per cent from 1989; Mountain View, CA\'s Sun\n\nMicrosystems Inc. reported second quarter revenues for the period ended Dec.\n\n28, 1990, of US&dollar;753 million which is 27 per cent higher than a\n\nyear ago; and, Stratus Computer Inc. of Marlboro, MA, announced fourth\n\nquarter 1990 revenues of US&dollar;118.5 million, up 21 per cent from  . \n\n  Software companies surveyed recorded the lowest gains.\n Legent Corp. of Vienna, VA, expects revenues of US&dollar;51.7\n\nmillion for the three months ended Dec. 31, 1990, compared to US&dollar;40.7\n\nmillion the year prior; El Segundo, CA-based Teradata Corp. reported\n\nrevenues of US&dollar;111.2 for the six months ended Dec. 31, 1990, up from\n\nUS&dollar;97.6 million a year earlier; and, Informix Corp. of Menlo\n\nPark, CA, plans to restructure its operations after announcing an expected\n\nloss for the fourth quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 1990. \n\n  Restructuring and layoffs were prominent throughout 1990 as many\n\nIT companies struggled.\n But Toller is quick to point out that restructuring isn\'t a response\n\nto recessionary times, but rather a response to a changing industry or\n\nmarket. \n\n  Wang Laboratories Inc. of Lowell, MA, has shown that sometimes\n\nit\'s not too late to turn around.\n The company showed an operating profit of US&dollar;4.9 million for\n\nthe six months ended Dec. 31, 1990, compared to a loss of US&dollar;38.4\n\nmillion the prior year.\n Net loss for the same period was down from US&dollar;72.6 million in\n\n1989 to US&dollar;22.1 million in  . \n\n  The company\'s focus on imaging and related products can be\n\ncredited for its financial gains.\n Wang claims unit sales for its imaging line for the first five months\n\nof fiscal 1991 exceeded those for the entire 1990 fiscal year. \n\n  A stronger focus on niche markets has also helped Westborough,\n\nMA-based Data General Corp. weather the recession.\n With a major product announcement scheduled for later this\n\nmonth, the company has posted first quarter 1991 profits of\n\nUS&dollar;12.5 million, up from a loss of US&dollar;20.5 million at the\n\nsame time last year. \n\n  Data General says the turnaround is due to reduced costs, a\n\nreorganized sales force and a strengthening of focus on niche markets like\n\nhealth care, geographical information systems and imaging.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  NEPEAN, Ont. - Gandalf Technologies Inc. is aiming to consolidate\n\nits share of the government market with a range of 10Base-T connectivity\n\nproducts. \n\n  The company has developed 10Base-T-compliant modular wiring\n\nhubs, called Access Hub 12, 48 and 132, that are designed to link up\n\nlocal-area network ( LAN) node devices such as PCs and fileservers.\n The Access Hub series coexists with the 10Base-T-compliant mini media\n\naccess unit ( MAU) transceiver, announced last October, and the network\n\ninterface card LANLine/AT, introduced in January. \n\n  An Ethernet LAN wide- and local-area networking bridge,\n\nmulti-protocol wide-area router and SNMP/OSI network management product\n\nwill be available in May.   " The 10Base-T ( wire trans <l>\n\nmission) standard has been issued as policy ... on the way the government\n\nwants to install structured wiring systems,"  said Paul Hession,\n\nGandalf vice-president of Canadian sales. \n\n\n  Gandalf already sells into federal government departments\n\nsuch as Health and Welfare, Public Works, and Agriculture.\n Hession also predicts expansion in commercial sectors such as\n\nfinance, insurance and communications ( existing customers include Wood\n\nGundy, Telecom Canada, and the CBC). \n\n \n\nconnection and wide-area networking product range based on its\n\nStarmaster network processor, which incorporates standards such as X.25,\n\nSNA and TCP/IP. \n\n  The difference with Access Hub is that users can have access to\n\nPC data via a LAN, whereas PCs only fulfilled a terminal emulation function\n\nunder Starmaster. \n\n  Director of Gandalf\'s LAN business unit, Peter Burke, said\n\ncustomers had begun to demand PC support,  " so we can\'t ignore it.\n It bodes well for a good combination - if we get there in time."\n\n \n\n  "\n\nopportunity"  of &dollar;600 million worldwide, growing to\n\n&dollar;2 billion within the next two years. \n " It could very well represent, to the Canadian\n\nmarketplace, 10 per cent of our revenues within 10 months of this launch.\n\n "  \n\n  Access Hub uses unshielded twisted-pair wiring and Hession\n\nclaims that, as technology has evolved,  " the data rate we can\n\nsupport ... is 10 million bits per second, which was unheard of five or 10\n\nyears ago."   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Markham Ont.-based Advanced Logic Research ( Canada) Ltd.

{'text': 'BY RON JEGERINGS\n\n  Making good prints from color negatives isn\'t difficult.\n Given a decent darkroom, a weekend can be spent making attractive\n\nprints.\n Your level of production may be low, however.\n We all dream of higher output - if for no other reason than to churn\n\nout enough photo Christmas cards for the season without staying up half the\n\nnight. \n\n  In your quest for increased output remember the two C-words:\n\nconservative and consistent.\n While printing with the speed of a commercial photofinisher is an\n\nimpossible dream for studio and home darkrooms, there is a lot you can do to\n\nimprove. \n\n  First, examine your film habits.\n Amateurs tend to try all the new films, while professionals pick\n\na few and stick with them.\n A pro will also buy in bulk from the same emulsion batch and cold\n\nstore all but those for immediate use in order to ensure exact color balance.\n\n\n\n  For experimenting, expose a variety of color-negative films,\n\nusing the same light and subject.\n Avoid trying every film in the store since some may require differ\n\n<l> ent enlarger filtration for neutral color balance. \n\n  Like film, it\'s wise to buy a large quantity of enlarging\n\npaper from the same emulsion batch.\n This cuts down on the number of sheets wasted every time you must\n\nfine-tune color balance for a new batch.\n Consistent paper processing isn\'t a chore at moderate temperatures.\n A simple drum system with a water pre-soak usually does the job, and\n\na water bath for chemistry bottles can be controlled by adding hot or\n\ncold water. \n\n  But low-temperature processing is slow.\n Reducing time with higher temperatures, however, may require the\n\nuse of a table-top processor, or a system that rotates the drum in a\n\ntemperature-controlled water bath during processing.\n Otherwise, temperature drift will have you constantly fiddling with\n\nenlarger filtration.\n Shorter processing times demand that solutions flow quickly over\n\npaper.\n A drum system ( like a Jobo with an optional Lift) that allows quick\n\nsolution exchange can also help.\n Some printers will compromise between room temperature and\n\nthe recommended maximum temperature, which decreases humidity to\n\nmake the process easier. \n\n  Once you pick a temperature, stick with it.\n Change the temperature and you may change color balance and density.\n Trying different color chemistries can also alter color balance, as\n\ncan using a water pre-soak before development for one session and not for the\n\nnext. \n\n  Be consistent in all things including the direction you turn\n\nenlarger filter dials.\n Take your pick, either clockwise or counter-clockwise, but always\n\nturn them in the same direction for equal tension and repeatability. \n\n  The color temperature of printing light should also be\n\nconsistent.\n Tungsten-halogen bulbs in dichroic color enlargers are more\n\nstable than household tungsten bulbs normally found in condenser\n\nenlargers.\n When buying a dichroic color enlarger get a stabilized power\n\nsupply to compensate for line-voltage fluctuations.\n They cost more than simple step-down transformer power supplies sold\n\nwith some color enlargers, but you will recover the cost in saved paper. \n\n  While tungsten-halogen bulbs are expensive, buying two or\n\nthree at a time is cheaper in the long run.\n If they are from the same manufacturer, chances are good that only\n\nslight filtration changes will be needed when one blows.\n And if changing bulbs in your enlarger is fairly easy, you may wish\n\nto keep a separate bulb for each color process: one for printing from color\n\nnegatives, another for making duplicate transparencies.\n Using up a bulb to make black-and-white prints after you went to all\n\nthe bother of doing ringaround tests to establish color balance is foolish.\n A few electronic color heads automatically correct color\n\nbalance, and additive printing systems can compensate for bulb varia <l>\n\ntions. \n\n  A color analyzer can speed up production by metering\n\nexposure and filtration, but isn\'t like a camera meter in simplicity.\n To make a print with correct color balance and density, program the\n\nanalyzer for the filtration and exposure used.\n If you have a master negative that can monitor printing and\n\nprocessing, and it prints with different filtration from session to session,\n\nyou will spend more time resetting your analyzer than using it.\n It\'s time to analyze technique and see how consistency can be\n\nachieved.\n Even consistent printers may have to tweak an analyzer program\n\nslightly at the start of a session to overcome such problems as\n\nchemistry aging, so don\'t add avoidable problems.\n The advantage of test strips and test prints is that they compensate\n\nfor day-to-day system variations. \n\n  Once programmed, an analyzer should compensate for color shifts\n\ncaused by myriad factors: shooting under different lighting conditions, using\n\ndifferent enlarger mixing boxes or different bulbs, bulb aging, a white-light\n\nlever that doesn\'t always return dichroic filters to the same position,\n\nenlarger lenses with slightly different color correction, and much more.\n\n\n\n  Most color analyzers have easel probes that offer a choice of\n\nspot or integrated readings to compensate for varying negative density and\n\nmagnification changes.\n In the integrated mode the same easel probe is used, but a diffuser\n\nunder the enlarger lens scrambles tones together so only one reading is\n\nrequired. \n\n  Spot readings are more precise, and like camera spot readings\n\ndemand more of the operator.\n You have to program specifically for the color being metered.\n Write a program for flesh tones and not only will it attempt to make\n\ngrass the color of that flesh tone, it will try to turn all flesh tones the\n\nsame color. \n\n  For this reason, most photographers program for a grey tone; it\'s\n\na good idea to have the image of a standard 18-percent grey card, like\n\nKodak\'s, in your master negative.\n You can use this to set up the analyzer, then look for equivalent\n\ntones in mixed negatives, such as pavement and highlights on dark\n\nclothing. \n\n  Since accurate judgement is called for, some photographers use\n\nonly spot probes when there is time, to place a control grey card in the\n\nscene ( at the shooting stage.)\n\n\n  Exposure errors occur in integrated readings when the negative\n\nhas large light or dark areas.\n ( They also depend on a mix of scene colors adding up to neutral\n\ndensity.)\n Take a picture of a white dog against a blue sky and you will print a\n\nyellowish dog as the analyzer tries to correct for the excess blue.\n One factor that aids integrated readings which depend on a mix\n\nof scene colors adding up to neutral density is that many colors are closer\n\nto neutral than we imagine. \n\n  So, pick a few films and stick with them.\n While in theory you program the analyzer only for the paper in use,\n\nsome have to be programmed for the combination of paper and negative.\n The fewer negative-paper programs you have to write - or the fewer\n\nsmall adjustments that have to be made - the more time you spend making\n\nprints. \n\n  Analyzers can be slow.\n With subtractive enlargers, changing one filter setting can\n\naffect another channel and you may have to go through the filter settings two\n\nor more times to eliminate cross-talk. \n\n  Making up for this slowness is the fact that one analyzer can be\n\nused with different enlargers.\n Buy a self-contained electronic system, like some of Durst\'s\n\nenlargers or a Beseler/Minolta 45A head, and production increases but you are\n\ntied to one machine and perhaps one format.\n If this isn\'t a problem, and you have a lot of spare change, remember\n\nthat systems vary functionally and require individual research. \n\n  What holds true for all systems is the need for consistency.\n Skip all over the map trying new chemistries, films, processing\n\ntechniques and equipment and you\'ll spend more time programming fancy\n\nequipment than making pictures.  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Ilford has introduced a new fast, fine grain black-and-white\n\nfilm: 400 DELTA.\n In its technical information brochure (\n#9446), Ilford promises that DELTA is  " ideal for pictorial and fine\n\nart photography." \n " prints made from 400 DELTA film exposed at\n\nEI 400/27 have very fine grain and outstanding sharpness"  and\n\n " the results are similar to those expected from a conventional\n\nmedium speed black-and-white film."  \n\n  Interest in DELTA is high, and its arrival has been eagerly\n\nawaited.\n Ilford has always maintained an unwavering allegiance to black and\n\nwhite, and I thought they might be able to solve the problem of producing a\n\nfine grain version of Kodak Tri-X which continues to be my favorite\n\nblack-and-white panchromatic film.\n I like the quality of the Tri-X image and the fact that\n\ndodging/burning and bleaching can bring difficult to print areas of the print\n\nin line with the entire image. \n\n  400 DELTA is Ilford\'s response to Kodak\'s T-grain technology.\n\n\n\n\n  T-Max films are easy to overexpose and overdevelop with the\n\nresult that grain structure in the affected areas is scrambled and will\n\nnot print image detail.\n So while T-Max is a very fine grain film, it is also a very fussy\n\nfilm best used under extremely controlled studio situations and processed by\n\na properly tuned machine.\n Ilford Core Shell Crystal technology on the other hand seems to avoid\n\nthese problems while still producing fine grain. \n\n  Reviewing DELTA opens up a lot of good, interesting questions\n\nabout testing and using black-and-white film.\n 400 Delta is a beautiful film but it doesn\'t test out at its rated\n\nfilm speed.\n It is really a medium-speed film and a very good one.\n The film is crisp, clear, prints beautifully, and has tiny\n\ngrain.\n It compares well with Agfa 25, the slowest black-and-white 35 mm film\n\ncurrently available.\n However, it doesn\'t test at a consistent 400 ISO.\n If you want to be sure to capture detail in the shadows, it tests at\n\n100 ISO in practice. \n\n\n  Here\'s what I do to test a black-and-white film.\n First, I double check the manufacturer\'s speed rating for the\n\nfilm.\n I do that to protect shadow values.\n If the film speed is set incorrectly high, then the shadows run a\n\ngood chance of not being recorded.\n If the speed is set too low, then the film receives unnecessary\n\nexposure which can result in increased grain and loss of detail in the\n\nwhites.\n Secondly, I test for the proper development time for the film.\n The film needs the development which will allow an exposure three\n\nstops above what the meter indicates to print as white with just a little bit\n\nof detail.\n There needs to be some separation between anything that receives\n\nthat exposure and the paper base.\n Thirdly, I determine the exposure the film needs for a\n\nmulti-toned subject ( including blacks in shadow and whites in sunlight) on a\n\nsunny day with sharp-edged shadows.\n Among other things, this is a way to compare one film to another\n\nunder actual shooting conditions.\n Lastly, I see how the film responds to a variety of situations and\n\ndouble check my results by using the film a lot.\n I need five to 10 rolls of the same emulsion batch to run the tests.\n One for starters, then maybe another two to figure out the film\n\ndevelopment time, and the rest to use in practical picture taking to\n\ndouble check the results. \n\n  These tests are definitely not just for lab technicians.\n These are practical tests that anybody who uses black-and-white film\n\nshould do. \n\n\n  Ilford recommends two of its own film developers: Ilfotec HC ( a\n\nliquid) diluted 1:31 and ID-11 ( a powder) used undiluted in its stock\n\nsolution form.\n ( Literature from Ilford U.S. mentions ID-11 PLUS developer\n\nwhich is not available here.\n We get regular ID-11 from England.\n According to Ilford Canada these two developers are different!)\n I used the Ilford developers in addition to my regular film\n\ndeveloper Kodak HC-110 diluted 1:31. \n\n  With all three developers, the film rated at about 100 ISO using\n\ntungsten lights.\n Had I used daylight, which is more actinic, it would have rated at\n\nabout 160 ISO.\n HC-110 consistently gave a bit more density than the two Ilford\n\ndevelopers.\n All three developers produced negatives that look much better than\n\nmedium speed negatives.\n Printers produced from them have excellent tonal separation ranging\n\nfrom deep black with detail to light whites just barely separated from paper\n\nbase.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM',

{'text': 'The fibre-optic Hosemaster makes painting with light a\n\nphotographic reality.  \n\n\n  Behind a studio door the pop, pop of a commercial photographer\'s\n\narmy of strobes has been replaced by an odd clapping sound and what sounds\n\nlike the beep of a truck\'s backup warning signal.\n Inside, Pat LaCroix is bouncing around the set, waving the source of\n\nthese new and unusual sounds - the Hosemaster - over and around and under a\n\nsaxophone player and the tool of his trade.\n The Polaroid is held under the light of the studio\'s kitchen stove:\n\nthe image is remarkable.\n The bell of the sax ( from whence the sound emerges) glows with hazy\n\nhighlights.\n The player himself is awash in diffused light.\n And the difficult exposure balance between the player\'s face and\n\nthe gleaming brass instrument has been pulled off perfectly.\n What\'s equally striking is how the image seems to be sharply defined\n\nin one part and deliberately hazy in others. \n\n  LaCroix, a professional photographer for 25 years, is\n\nclearly pleased. \n " I\'ve been shooting a long time, so it\'s important to get a\n\nlittle creative buzz every now and then. When I started using the Hosemaster,\n\nI began to think, \'Hey! I could use it for this, and this and this....\' "\n\n  \n\n  The Hosemaster, to hear Hosemaster afficionados such as\n\nLaCroix, Peter Horvath and Ottmar Bierwagen describe it, is an innova <l>\n\ntive new creative tool that may change the face of studio photography.\n All three Toronto-based shooters are using it, for both\n\ncorporate and personal work.\n\n\nsays Horvath. \n " It\'s definitely right up there on the \'new\' list."\n\n  \n\n  adds\n\nBierwagen. \n " I think it\'s the most interesting piece of lighting\n\ninnovation to come along in 20 years."   \n\n  Horvath makes a " vacuum cleaner" analogy; it\'s an apt descrip\n\n<l> tion for the Hosemaster, invented by American photographer Aaron Jones,\n\nlooks just like a pull-along vacuum.\n Instead of sucking in dust, however, it beams out light through a\n\n4.6-metre ( 15 ft.) length of fibre-optic cable.\n One end of the cable plugs into a rolling power-supply case, which\n\nholds a fan-cooled quartz-arc 5500 K lamp.\n The business end of the cable is capped by a rectangular-shaped\n\nplastic housing about the size of a small household paintbrush, onto which\n\nlight-shaping masks or gels can be clipped or Velcroed. \n\n  Holding this black " paintbrush" by hand, the photographer\n\nmoves around the set, brushing a stroke of light here, dabbing a pinpoint\n\nbeam there.\n " feeling\n\nlike a painter."  \n\n  The Hosemaster differs from other fibre-optic lighting systems,\n\nsuch as the HMI ( in existence for 15 years), in that it has its own shutter\n\nsystem, which is mounted on a stand just in front of the camera lens.\n The shutter is operated by a button on the paintbrush; another button\n\ncauses a filter holder ( usually fitted with a soft-focus filter) to swing up\n\nin front of the lens.\n To create a picture, then, the studio is made dark, the camera is set\n\nfor a time exposure, and the photographer uses the paintbrush to illuminate\n\nvarious parts of the scene, clicking the noisy shutter ( the source of\n\nthat clapping noise) open and closed as he paints with the light, swinging\n\nthe filter back and forth to make some highlights soft, some hard.\n A beeper sounds at one-second intervals while the shutter is open to\n\nhelp the photographer time each exposure: a half-beep wash for the\n\nsaxophonist\'s face ( so he\'s not restricted to stay perfectly still), four\n\nbeeps for the sax\'s bell, and so on.\n And on.\n LaCroix\'s masterly photographing of an otherwise near-impossible pub\n\n<l> licity shot of his friend Al Clootens, consisted of three different\n\nexposures: an initial wash with a wide-open Hosemaster diffused; gold gel\n\nclipped into the Hosemaster which was then stuck inside the sax\'s bell\n\nand exposed for four seconds; a half-second exposure with the Hosemaster\n\noutside the sax.\n Once the initial wash is over, and the face is properly exposed, it\n\ndoesn\'t matter if the face moves at all, since these are all separate\n\nexposures.\n ( The glow around the sax player was from a diffuser placed in front\n\nof the lens.)\n admits LaCroix.\n\n\n\n  What LaCroix and others love about the system is the lighting\n\naccuracy it affords.\n says LaCroix.\n\n\n " Even with the most spectral of strobe spots, you can\n\nreally only get so small.\n I\'m always playing around with shaving mirrors ( to get a narrow\n\nbeam), but even then you still get spillover."   \n\n  LaCroix pulls out a picture of a collection of small dolls, each\n\nof which was lighted individually and differently.\n The face of a very ugly, old French hunchback doll was lit from\n\nunderneath to enhance the sense of ugliness, while a delicate porcelain doll\n\nwas given a softer wash of light with diffusion.\n The face of one of the dolls is pin-sharp, the others slightly\n\ndiffused.\n " You can make one face focused and one diffused with a\n\nstrobe, but you\'d never be able to get the different qualities of light with\n\nany other type of lighting,"  he points out. \n\n  Because the lighting is applied by hand, and the exposure timed\n\nby ear, invariably each frame is slightly different from the one before, and\n\neach truly the creative product of the individual holding the " brush."\n This unpredictability in the Hosemaster\'s character is something\n\nOttmar Bierwagen enjoys. \n " Every image you get out of it is unique, and there\'s a\n\nlittle bit of a thrill in that because you sort of don\'t know what\'s coming."\n\n \n Bierwagen created the still life shown here by starting with a strobe\n\nexposure of two stops under what his meter read, followed by about 15\n\nexposures using the Hosemaster.\n Holding the light close to the flowers, he painted the stems with a\n\nslashing motion, and then waved the light inside the buds for about three sec\n\n<l> onds each.\n Next, he projected the light through the back of the vase for about\n\n20 seconds to give it  " just a small hint of translucence." \n Using a mask with a tiny opening for the light beam, he then circled\n\nthe light around one side of the pear and red marble. \n " You can\'t control strobes well enough to give you that\n\nmany spots of light; you\'d have to have 35 snoots of various kinds all\n\nover the place."   \n\n  Constant movement of the Hosemaster " paintbrush" ( and the\n\nphotographer\'s body parts) is necessary to avoid imprinting a ghost\n\nsilhouette on the film.\n\n\n  A concern of some photographers is that the " Hosehead look" will\n\ntoo soon become a cliché?\n Peter Horvath doesn\'t agree.\n Initially skeptical of its potential, Horvath soon fell in love with\n\nthe versatility of the system and the hot neon colors the light produces.\n " I\'m seeing a real saturation I wouldn\'t normally get with\n\nstrobes,"  he says. \n " I feel like I\'m on to something with it: a really new way\n\nof shooting."   \n\n  Horvath\'s " new mutant art form", as he calls it, springs from\n\nhis technique of not using a base strobe exposure at all, but instead relying\n\non the Hosemaster - usually heavily gelled - for all of an image\'s\n\nlight.\n " is that I\n\nhave to remember what I did - how long I exposed each area. \n I\'m trying to develop it into an intuitive thing; I\'d like it to come\n\nmore from my gut than from my head."   \n\n  This kind of innovation doesn\'t come cheap, however.\n Vistek in Toronto, Canadian agent for the Hosemaster, is asking\n\n&dollar;8,695, or &dollar;150 per day on rental. \n\n  LaCroix bit the bullet and bought one, but both Bierwagen and\n\nHorvath are still reeling from sticker shock.\n The cost is bound to come down, though, as the Hosemaster\'s\n\npopularity spawns imitators. \n\n  And most feel the Hosemaster will catch on quickly, as\n\nphotographers and art directors continue to experiment with a new way of\n\npainting with light.\n " The style in photography\n\nfor the last 10 years has been to haul out that 10-foot bank of light and\n\nwhap through two or three or four thousand watts and make it nice and even\n\nand smooth from edge to edge.\n\n\ntographers who are using hot lights and shadows and are breaking all the\n\nrules.\n This Hosemaster kind of lighting system is one more tool of change."\n\n  \n\n\n\n Light is like Shangri-la - it\'s there, you just have to know\n\nwhere to look for it.  \n\n\n  For both amateurs and professionals, one of the great\n\nphotographic puzzles is the way in which light loses intensity over distance.\n Logically, moving a light from two metres away to four metres from\n\nthe set should halve the intensity.\n Logically, you open the lens one stop.\n But your light meter says two stops and the aperture is too large for\n\ndepth-of-field.\n Move the light closer and illumination is too uneven across the set.\n\n\n  If light loss isn\'t logical, how can anyone gain control?\n Fortunately, a logical pattern is described by the inverse square\n\nlaw.\n The mathematics are basic, and once the concept is understood you can\n\nchuck the pocket calculator. \n\n  Though terms like light loss and falloff are convenient,\n\nthey are misleading.\n Light isn\'t lost over distance, just dispersed differently.\n Darkroom workers will understand dispersion.\n As an enlarger head is raised, more of the easel is illuminated,\n\nbut it is merely the same amount of light spread over a larger area. \n\n  The key, technically speaking, is the inverse square law.\n It doesn\'t matter whether you use feet or metres to calculate,\n\nthough metres may be too broad and centimetres too minute, for the prin <l>\n\nciple of the inverse square law still holds true: l/2  2  and 1/4\n\n 2  = 1/4 and 1/16 \n\n  Light intensities are 1/4 and 1/16 at two and four metres\n\nrespectively, which explains why the meter recommends two stops instead\n\nof one stop more exposure at the longer distance. \n\n  What happens if we make 1/4 and 1/16, f/4 and f/l6?\n Away go the math calculations when working under pressure.\n You can match distances to aperture numbers simply because aperture\n\nlight control is related to the inverse square law.\n One side of a set might be four feet from the light ( f/4) and the\n\nfar side eight feet ( f/8).\n Two stops of light are lost, which is only acceptable for a special\n\neffect. \n\n  Understanding the inverse square law is essential for\n\nunderstanding light in photography and for solving all sorts of lighting\n\nproblems such as how to achieve even illumination. \n\n  Lighting problems are inevitable it you do not understand the\n\ndifference between uneven illumination and high contrast - an easy\n\nmisunderstanding since uneven light can be almost as contrasty as light\n\nthat casts deep shadows.\n To cure uneven light, a photographer might add a fill light at the\n\ncamera, which fills in the shadows but still results in uneven light by\n\nilluminating both sides equally. \n\n  Understanding how much light is lost at near distances helps when\n\non-camera flash causes washed-out foregrounds and black-hole backgrounds.\n Black backgrounds may not fill a shot - if they add drama or obscure\n\nunwanted objects - but washed-out foreground faces are deadly.\n When space allows, try a longer lens and shoot from a greater\n\ndistance for more even illumination. \n\n  Bounce flash isn\'t used in color as it is in black and white, for\n\noff-white ceilings and walls can create oddly-hued complexions.\n Even so, when the bounce surface is off-white ( or near-white\n\nwithout the cold tint of green or blue), bounce flash increases light\n\ndistances ( from light to bounce surface and then back to subjects) and\n\nillumination is more even.\n The only stipulation may be to use a fill card on the flash head to\n\nopen up shadows cast by bounce lighting.\n Moving a light far enough back requires unacceptably large\n\napertures, or the knocking out of a wall.\n The solution is to use fill cards on the opposite side of the set to\n\nbounce the light. \n\n  Again, there is confusion between the contributions of even\n\nlight and fill in lowering contrast.\n A large source - such as ceiling or wall with bounce flash creates\n\nits own fill to lower the contrast.\n Therefore, there is a tendency to attribute contrast reduction\n\nsolely to source size and discount the contribution of even\n\nillumination. \n\n  An umbrella is a large source which provides its own fill and\n\nlowers contrast.\n When used for bounce flash it also reduces light fall-off since\n\nthe light travels up the shaft before returning to the subject,\n\nincreasing light distance.\n Some photographers call umbrellas wall extenders, for they are\n\nparticularly helpful in expanding small rooms. \n\n  Feathering the light is another trick.\n Since most the lights have a brighter central hot spot in the\n\nillumination patch, you can aim a light in such a way that bright central\n\nrays travel farthest, thus creating more even illumination.\n Some lights are difficult to feather.\n When there\'s no visible hot spot and no intense central light,\n\nit\'s not so easy to know exactly where to aim the centre of the light to\n\nachieve even illumination.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '2f01498f-cce8-4e5e-8938-53dff733a3d8', 'added':

{'text': 'Detecting fingerprints on plastic bags crammed with illegal drugs\n\nhas been about as easy as getting a crime lord to declare the source of his\n\nincome to the tax man. \n\n  But innovative technology using fumes from super-strength glues in\n\na vacuum chamber is giving Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigators clear\n\nfingerprints from plastic sandwich bags and other materials that normally\n\nyield little evidence. \n\n  Developed by a scientist at the National Research Council in\n\nOttawa, the technique produces quality prints faster than methods usually\n\nused by police.\n\n\n \n\nscience and technology branch in Ottawa, says prints don\'t stick well to\n\nplastic bags, bottles or porous materials. \n\n  Methods including dusting will continue to be used by\n\ninvestigators, but the vacuum-chamber method is providing an important new\n\ntool in crime fighting. \n\n  Fumes emitted by cyanoacrylate, the active ingredient in the extra\n\nstrength glue, have been used for more than a decade to detect fingerprints.\n But the material has to be heated to produce the vapors that enhance\n\nthe ridges on prints. \n\n  That process requires bulky equipment, often produces imperfect\n\nprints and increases exposure to noxious fumes. \n\n  About a year ago, John Watkin, a scientist on contract to the\n\nNRC, experimented by using a vacuum chamber to lower the atmospheric pressure\n\nso the cyanoacrylate boils and vaporizes at room temperature. \n\n  This method, says John Arnold, Watkin\'s supervisor and manager of\n\nthe NRC public-security program, produces superior fingerprints. \n\n  The development is the first for the Canadian Police Research\n\nCentre, an Ottawa-based joint venture of the NRC, RCMP and the Canadian\n\nAssociation of Chiefs of Police. \n\n  The cylindrical vacuum chamber is about five feet long and one\n\nfoot in diameter - large enough to hold dozens of plastic bags or a weapon as\n\nbig as a 12-gauge shotgun. \n\n  When fingerprints are exposed to the cyanoacrylate vapor, a\n\npolymer coats the ridges.\n The item bearing the prints is then removed from the chamber and\n\ndipped into a fluorescent dye solution. \n\n  Prints are then viewed under a portable fingerprint lamp, also\n\ndeveloped for the NRC by Watkin.\n Under the Luma-Lite, the prints show up as a brilliant yellow on a\n\nblack background. \n\n  Arnold says 10 print units are being shipped to RCMP\n\nfield-identification centres across Canada for testing.\n One has been used since November at the RCMP forensic identification\n\nlaboratory in Ottawa. \n\n  Arnold said the units cost about &dollar;50,000 to develop and\n\ncould sell for &dollar;10,000 to &dollar;20,000 each.\n He said the NRC is interested in licensing the technology to\n\ncompanies that will manufacture and market them.  \n\n\n Danish firm testing new system to cut acid rain-producing gases\n\n\n\n  A less costly way of cleaning up acid rain-producing gases\n\nemitted by power stations and other industrial systems will be tested in the\n\nU.S. \n\n  Danish firm FLS Miljo will install its gas-treating system at a\n\nKentucky plant for a test that will begin next year. \n\n  FLS Miljo is a subsidiary of the Danish company FLS Industries -\n\nworld\'s largest maker of cement-production equipment - and a leading maker of\n\ncement kilns and industrial hardware. \n\n  Miljo has been diversifying into environmental control systems,\n\nincluding equipment to remove sulphur dioxide gas pollution. \n\n  As part of Miljo\'s strategy to produce new clean-up equipment for\n\nindustrial gases, an experimental system is to be installed next year at a\n\npower station in Shawnee, Ky., a test plant run by the Tennessee Valley\n\nAuthority. \n\n  If the Danish equipment operates as planned, it could be scaled\n\nup to provide equipment for large-scale power stations. \n\n  The U.S. Department of Energy is paying for the\n\nUS&dollar;4-million ( C&dollar;4.7 million) filtering system at Shawnee. \n\n  Removing acid gases from industrial equipment is crucial to\n\nreducing acid rain and other pollution.\n It is generally accomplished by scrubber systems that pass flue gases\n\nthrough a water-based slurry of lime.\n The process turns sulphur dioxide gas into solid calcium sulphate.\n\n\n\n  The new system from Miljo uses the same principles as traditional\n\nscrubbers developed by several companies, including Mitsubishi of Japan and\n\nSweden\'s Flakt, part of Asea Brown Boveri. \n\n  Like conventional systems, the FLS hardware uses lime - a mixture\n\nof water with calcium oxide or calcium carbonate - to react with the gases.\n\n\n\n  But Miljo\'s system reduces the size and expense of the process by\n\nchanging the design of the chamber in which the chemical reaction takes\n\nplace. \n\n  Lime is directed at the gas stream as it moves up a vertical\n\ncolumn.\n Conventional scrubbing systems spray lime using a massive chamber in\n\nwhich the gases move horizontally. \n\n  The Miljo design ensures that the gases stay in contact with the\n\ncalcium oxide longer.\n\n\n  The equipment includes hardware to filter out ash and dust.\n It recirculates some of this material along with the lime, which aids\n\nthe chemical reaction by reducing the acid content of the flue gas. \n\n  The overall impact of the new design, says Erik\n\nHoffmann-Petersen, Miljo president, is to reduce the size of the complete\n\nsystem. \n\n  That means a Miljo system can be installed for two thirds of the\n\nprice of a traditional scrubber. \n\n  Hoffmann-Petersen says Miljo\'s gas-removal system could be\n\nadapted for use by operational power stations and would cost US&dollar;10\n\nmillion to US&dollar;20 million. \n\n  Versions of the clean-up equipment that will be installed in the\n\nU.S. already are being used at six Danish municipal incinerators. \n\n  The systems are relatively cheap and remove sulphur dioxide and\n\nother gases from the waste streams of these plants. \n\n  The importance of the Kentucky project for Miljo is that it could\n\nprovide a big break in the large North American market for acid gas removal\n\nequipment.\n\n\n  As part of efforts to expand operations in the U.S., Miljo\n\nrecently bought Airpol, a small environmental-control company based in New\n\nJersey. \n\n  Besides new acid-gas clean-up hardware, Miljo sells conventional\n\nscrubbing equipment that is based on Mitsubishi\'s design.\n Miljo also sells electrostatic precipitators - systems that remove\n\ndust and other particles from large industrial plants such as cement works\n\n \n\n\n\n\n  People come in all shapes and sizes.\n Some reach their adult height when they\'re 12 years old, while others\n\ndon\'t spurt up until they\'re 15 or more. \n\n  People with the same chronological age can have markedly\n\ndifferent bone ages.\n Accurately assessing someone\'s bone age is critical in treating\n\ngrowth abnormalities or skeletal deformities, such as scoliosis, that require\n\nhormone treatment or surgery, says University of Calgary medical researcher\n\nStuart Coupland. \n\n\n  He gives an example of a 14-year-old whose left leg is growing\n\nfaster than the right.\n An orthopedic surgeon needs to assess how much more growth remains in\n\nthe normal leg to determine how big a piece of bone to cut out of the\n\nabnormal leg to ensure they\'ll both end up roughly the same length. \n\n  Coupland, a neural physiologist who dabbles in computer\n\nprogramming in his spare time, has developed a software program that improves\n\non the speed and accuracy of methods currently used to assess bone age. \n\n  The method favored by radiologists compares an X-ray of a hand\n\nwith a compilation of X-rays of hands of known age.\n It takes about five minutes, but is only accurate within a two-year\n\nperiod.\n What\'s more, it indicates the age of a person\'s hand bones, which can\n\nvary significantly from the bone age of the same person\'s leg or hip, says\n\nCoupland. \n\n  A second method, called RWT after the three researchers who\n\ndevised it 15 years ago, uses 37 measurements of the knee-joint to assess\n\nbone age of the lower extremities.\n Though accurate to within six months, it takes an hour or more to\n\ncomplete the assessment. \n\n  Using a Microsoft Quick Basic language program and a MacIntosh II\n\nworkstation, Coupland has computerized the RWT method to get an answer in\n\nless than 10 minutes. \n\n  " We had to make the RWT method practical in a clinical setting\n\nwithout losing the accuracy," says Coupland.\n " Orthopedic surgeons say they are happy with accuracy within six\n\nmonths. When it\'s one or two years off, they\'re concerned."  \n\n  Coupland used a video digitizer to transfer X-rays of knee joints\n\non to a computer screen.\n Based on the patient\'s gender and age, the computer decides how many\n\nof the 37 measurements of the joint have to be taken to calculate the correct\n\nbone age. \n\n  The program, called COMRAD, for Computerized Radiographic Age\n\nDiagnosis, leads the user through the steps to take the measurements off the\n\nscreen and calculates the bone age. \n\n  Coupland is enhancing the program to allow users to save the\n\npicture and measurements, probably on an optical disk, for future use.\n He has applied the same technology to measure abnormalities in facial\n\nand head bones.\n These craniofacial distortions, which are caused by genetic\n\nsyndromes, are often diagnosed visually making treatment less exact, he says.\n\n\n\n\n  COMRAD is being marketed by University Technologies International\n\nInc., a technology transfer company, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of\n\nthe university.\n UTI marketing manager Kathy Chan said COMRAD is being tested at a\n\nCalgary hospital and plans are under way for tests in the Toronto area. \n\n  Coupland holds the Canadian copyright for COMRAD and has applied\n\nfor U.S. copyright.\n Any profit he makes is split with the university, which funds UTI.\n He hopes to sell the software to various hospital radiology\n\ndepartments and research labs.\n UTI is doing a survey to determine the appropriate market and pricing\n\nfor the product.  \n\n\n Canadian firm has global vision for robot vacuum cleaner\'s launch\n\n\n\n  Cyberworks Inc., the tiny Canadian company causing a stir with a\n\nrevolutionary robot for the contract cleaning industry, is pursuing, after\n\njust one sale, European and North American markets. \n\n  " By the end of the summer we\'re hoping to get Europe launched\n\nand then North America by the end of the year," Vivek Burhan Parkar, the\n\n26-year-old founder and president of the Orillia,   \n\nOntario   firm, said in an interview here. \n\n\n  first customer is Hudon Groep Internationale\n\nof the Netherlands, one of Europe\'s largest service contractors. \n\n  Hudon, a wholly owned subsidiary of Vendex International NV, has\n\nbought 300 Cyberworks robot vacuum cleaners for &dollar;6 million. \n\n  Burhan Parkar says the robot machines have a unique market\n\nadvantage: " It\'s the first machine capable of working entirely on its own,\n\nwithout human programming or instruction." \n\n  The robot weighs about 180 kilograms - mostly batteries - and\n\nuses a sophisticated electronic vision system and artificial intelligence.\n\n\n\n  They are also cost effective at &dollar;20,000 each compared with\n\nup to almost eight times that amount for competing models that require\n\nconstant programming, Burhan Parkar says. \n\n  " We have a tremendous strategic and technological lead.\n\n\n  " It\'s a revolution in the cleaning industry," says Cees\n\nRavesteyn, vice-president of marketing and development for Hudon, which made\n\ncontact with Cyberworks by chance at a demonstration in Cologne, West\n\nGermany. \n\n  Hudon is now using eight of the robots in the Netherlands,\n\nBelgium and France and expects to expand by the end of the summer. \n\n\n  Studies of market potential in Europe indicate that Cyberworks\n\ncould sell at least 5,000 units a year, Ravesteyn said. \n\n  While Burhan Parkar talks confidently about penetrating major\n\nmarkets in North America and Europe, he said Cyberworks plans to proceed in "\n\ntypically Canadian, conservative fashion." \n\n  Burhan Parkar says he calculates it will take a minimum of two\n\nyears for any competition to catch up.  \n\n\n\n  Although virtual reality is in the development stages, a\n\nCalifornia company named VPL Research Inc. has already begun selling headgear\n\ncalled an " eyephone" and a lightweight, sensor-equipped glove that would\n\nallow a user to experience the sensation of picking up and moving objects\n\nthat appear in a virtual-reality environment.\n David Benman, VPL\'s sales-support engineer, said that the eyephone,\n\nwhich also resembles a scuba mask, sells for &dollar;11,200, while the glove\n\ncosts &dollar;10,500.\n A complete package, which includes the eyephone, glove and two\n\ncomputers manufactured by Silicon Graphics Computer Systems of Newport Beach,\n\n   California   , costs about &dollar;267,000.\n Benman said that VPL has sold its eyephone and glove to most of the\n\nU.S. research institutes and universities that are currently conducting\n\nvirtual-reality research.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5ae1431e-e8e7-4b9f-9eb2-157ec0ee512d', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.856082+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9495561122894287, 'non_english_score': 0.05044388771057129}
{'text': 'Super-strong golf clubs, artificial joints and ceramic engine\n\nparts appear to have little in common.\n\n\n  These advanced materials are composites, combinations of materials\n\noffering extreme strength and lightness.\n They are already being used in manufacturing, medicine, communications\n\nand aerospace industries.\n And the field is becoming increasingly competitive as countries such\n\nas Japan pour billions of dollars into research. \n\n\n  To help Canada stay in the race, the Ontario government\'s\n\nnonprofit Ontario Centre for Materials Research - biggest of seven centres of\n\nexcellence set up by the Premier\'s Council - will receive &dollar;43 million\n\nin provincial grants over five years. \n\n  The centre manages and promotes long-term research in advanced\n\nmaterials at the University of Waterloo, Hamilton\'s McMaster University,\n\nUniversity of Western Ontario in London, Queen\'s University in Kingston and\n\nUniversity of Toronto. \n\n  The two biggest applications for composites are military\n\nequipment and sporting goods, says Craig Simpson, of Ontario Hydro\'s research\n\ndivision. \n\n  Simpson spoke at the annual meeting of the Ontario Centre for\n\nMaterials Research ( OCMR) this week in Toronto and used a &dollar;150\n\ngolf-club shaft as a pointer during his presentation. \n\n  Simpson said the composite club was developed in Japan, where\n\nmost high-tech sports equipment originates.\n With the help of provincial funding and OCMR, a variety of products\n\nincorporating composites will one day be made in Ontario, he said. \n\n  The centre for materials research helps to fund world-class\n\nresearch projects and ensures that technological advances and information on\n\nnew materials flows into Canadian industry.\n When industry develops what the research community wants, funds also\n\nflow into corporate coffers. \n\n  For example, Toronto-based Electrofuel Manufacturing Co. Ltd.\n\nsupplied two pieces of equipment for McMaster\'s ceramics research. \n\n  Electrofuel President Sankar Das Gupta said a high-temperature,\n\nhigh-pressure furnace to measure the expansion and contraction of ceramics\n\nwas developed by the university and his company. \n\n  The furnace, which operates at 2,000 C - steel melts at about\n\n1,400 C - costs &dollar;55,000. \n\n  Electrofuel also designed and built a &dollar;150,000 vacuum hot\n\npress to manufacture ceramics parts. \n\n  Both pieces of equipment are owned by the centre for materials\n\nresearch, but McMaster will have first crack at acquiring them at fair market\n\nvalue when the centre\'s funding agreement with the government is completed.\n\n\n\n  Getting the equipment installed and working has resulted in\n\norders from research and development laboratories in other countries, Das\n\nGupta said.\n He expects the six-year-old company\'s revenues to double to &dollar;4\n\nmillion in 1990. \n\n  Other industry members include heavyweights such as Alcan\n\nAluminium Ltd., Imperial Oil Ltd. and Dofasco Inc., as well as smaller firms\n\nsuch as Ultra High Vacuum Instruments Ltd. in Burlington,  \n\n Ontario   , and Brampton\'s Colortech Inc. \n\n  Most OCMR initial funding went to buy equipment necessary to\n\ncarry out materials research.\n More than &dollar;1.2 million went to particle beam studies at\n\nWestern.\n McMaster\'s molecular beam epitaxy unit, which makes new materials for\n\nchips used in optical communications systems, cost &dollar;1.2 million. \n\n  The centre also funds university scientists working in:\n\nbiomaterials, polymers and composites; components handling optical and\n\nelectronic communications signals; metals and ceramics; the study of surfaces\n\nand interfaces. \n\n\n \n\nIllinois   , through its Mississauga-based Canadian subsidiary, is\n\npartially funding two OCMR-supported scientists working in biomedical\n\nmaterials at McMaster and    University of Toronto \n\n . \n\n  One researcher is studying changes in blood coagulation rates\n\nwhen it comes in contact with materials in kidney dialysis machines and other\n\nequipment.\n The other researcher is trying to develop a coating to protect\n\ntransplanted pancreatic cells from being rejected. \n\n  Almost &dollar;10 million was allocated to more than 30 OCMR\n\nprojects in the year ended March 31, 1989.  \n\n\n\n\n  Discount brokers are offering clients a variety of electronic\n\nmarket-quote systems to get more information into  hands -\n\nand more commissions into  pockets. \n\n  Clients at Toronto-based Marathon Brokerage can choose from\n\nmarket-information systems developed by Stratford Software Corp. of\n\nVancouver, Toronto-based International Hay-Info Communications Inc. or Bell\n\nCanada\'s Alex home shopping service. \n\n  Alex, which has been operating in Montreal for more than a year,\n\nwill be available in the Toronto area starting next Monday. \n\n  Stratford and Hav-Info provide real-time quotes.\n Alex offers real-time quotes from the Montreal and Toronto stock\n\nexchanges and a 15-minute delay on the Vancouver exchange. \n\n\n  Toronto Dominion Green Line Investor Services Inc. has its own\n\nreal-time quote service, which is accessible by touch-tone phone, but it also\n\noffers Alex. \n\n  Discounters say do-it-yourself quotes and market information are\n\nideal for people who manage their own investments, do their own research and\n\nanalysis, and only use a broker to trade securities. \n\n  " They take control of their own portfolios and look to us for\n\ninformation, not for advice or recommendations," Marathon President Paul\n\nBates said. \n\n  He believes giving clients more information means they will trade\n\nmore often, generating more commission fees. \n\n  Stratford\'s information system, called Suzy, has more\n\nmarket-related features than the others, but it doesn\'t cover U.S. exchanges.\n\n\n  Suzy offers quotes from four Canadian exchanges, stock indices,\n\nshare price changes and volumes, a breakdown of trades on each company,\n\nportfolio updates, and news stories and press releases carried by the Globe &\n\nMail\'s InfoGlobe service and StockWatch, a Vancouver publication.\n It can compile lists of the most active stocks or generate daily or\n\nweekly stock-price graphs. \n\n  Bates said Marathon is working with Stratford to develop features\n\nthat will enable clients to access their own accounts and check the balance\n\nand margin available, or get information on Marathon\'s services. \n\n  Suzy\'s electronic mail feature also allows users to send memos or\n\nfiles.\n Stratford is setting up information networks on various subjects.\n Already available is small business accounting, run by software\n\nconsultant Richard Morochove, and entrepreneurship, run by Rick Spence,\n\neditor of Small Business magazine. \n\n  Hav-Info doesn\'t yet provide news items or graphics, but its\n\nquotes service is more extensive, covering not only four Canadian exchanges\n\nbut Trans Canada options, Toronto\'s over-the-counter stocks, New York and\n\nAmerican stock exchanges, and the Dow Jones industrial average. \n\n\n  Alex carries quotes from the three exchanges, but is working with\n\nthe exchanges and other market-quote service firms to beef up its financial\n\nofferings.\n It carries a host of other information, including a shop-at-home\n\nservice. \n\n  The three companies charge about the same for quote services, but\n\nhardware and software requirements differ. \n\n  The basic fee for Suzy is 20 cents a minute, plus on-line charges\n\nor tapping into the news databases and using other features.\n Discounts are offered after market hours.\n charges 29 cents a\n\nminute and Alex 25 cents a minute for quotes. \n\n  Suzy is a software disk that costs &dollar;29.95.\n To use it you need an IBM or IBM-compatible personal computer with at\n\nleast 384K of ram memory and a modem.\n\n\n  Hav-Info\'s system also runs on IBM or IBM compatible PCs with\n\nmodems.\n But Marathon clients who don\'t have a computer can buy a Hav-Info\n\nterminal with built-in modem for &dollar;599, a &dollar;200 discount from the\n\nregular price.\n Communications software allowing the unit to send and receive data is\n\nfree. \n\n  An IBM or Macintosh PC with modem, and free software provided by\n\nBell, will pick up Alex.\n Those without computers need a special terminal, which plugs into a\n\nphone jack and rents for &dollar;7.95 a month.\n\n\n  Green Line\'s direct quote service is free to clients who do at\n\none trade a month through the discounter.\n Non-traders get 25 free quotes a month, before a &dollar;0.25-a-quote\n\ncharge kicks in.  \n\n\n\n\n  Document imaging is the latest weapon in the war against paper\n\nburden.\n These systems scan letters, invoices and legal documents and store\n\nthem in picture form on computer disk. \n\n  The process is intended to speed up paper flow through large\n\norganizations, said Elliot Katz, a product manager with Wang Canada Ltd. \n\n  Banks, insurance companies and government agencies are among the\n\nfirst to get into document imaging. \n\n  " There\'s massive savings available," said Paul Renaud, director\n\nof technology for SHL Systemhouse Inc. of Ottawa. \n\n  The snag is that document systems are expensive - &dollar;15,000\n\nto &dollar;20,000 a workstation - because pictures require a lot of hardware.\n They also take up a lot of space on disk and demand high-powered\n\nmicroprocessors. \n\n  With scanners to read documents, optical disk storage and a few\n\nhigh-resolution monitors, a typical entry-level network costs about\n\n&dollar;650,000.\n Large systems can add robot-controlled libraries of optical disks and\n\nsatellite communications links. \n\n  The U.S.-based Association for Information & Image Management\n\nestimates the market for image systems will be worth US&dollar;12.7 billion\n\nby 1993, making it potentially one of the strongest segments of the computer\n\nindustry. \n\n  The two biggest players are Wang, which has sold 20 of its\n\nminicomputer-based systems in Canada, and Filenet Corp. of California, which\n\nhas sold five. \n\n  Although suppliers are quick to compare imaging to earlier\n\ncomputer stars, such as data processing in the 1970s or desktop publishing in\n\nthe 1980s, users haven\'t been as quick to lay down their cash. \n\n  Systemhouse\'s Renaud said one reason could be the generic\n\none-system-for-all approach some suppliers have taken. \n\n  " There\'s a fair number of misconceptions about image\n\nsystems.\n The first one is that there\'s a cookie-cutter or no-brain solution\n\nfor everyone."   \n\n  Although most large organizations will admit to having a problem\n\nwith paper, the solution must be tailored to specific bottlenecks in the\n\ncompany and build from their computer system, as opposed to scanning\n\neverything in the office, he added. \n\n  Mutual Life Assurance Co. of Canada uses a Filenet system to\n\nspeed the processing of death claims. \n\n  " It has improved our service in the department, reduced the\n\namount of paper and we no longer lose pieces of paper," said Ray Simonson, an\n\nadministrative services executive with the firm. \n\n  But, he added, the system " is not really as useful as\n\ninformation coded in a database." \n\n  For example, a traditional database record system can track\n\ncustomers by sex, age, or other characteristics, which can be easily\n\ncross-referenced by computer. \n\n  Documents stored in picture form can\'t be automatically broken\n\ndown into such categories. \n\n  And organizations that deal with paper efficiently have a hard\n\ntime justifying the high cost of jumping to an electronic system. \n\n  But technological improvements and the recent introduction of\n\nlow-cost systems for personal computers from large manufacturers such as Wang\n\nand International Business Machines Corp. are likely to change that, Simonson\n\nsaid.   " Now we\'re looking again."   \n\n  One firm hoping to jump in at the bottom end of the market is\n\nsoftware firm Imara Research Corp. of Toronto.\n Imara intends to ship a &dollar;400 imaging program that can be used\n\non relatively low-cost standard hardware.\n The program, which has yet to be named, will be available in June.\n\n\n\n  Imara has already done joint marketing with IBM and software\n\ngiant Microsoft Corp., which are counting on new products to stimulate sales\n\nof computers using Microsoft\'s new operating system, OS/2. \n\n  " Imara\'s is one of the first imaging products built on standard\n\ntechnology that can sit on anybody\'s machine without spending hundreds of\n\nthousands of dollars," said David Boker, Microsoft Canada\'s corporate\n\naccounts manager.\n " There\'s certainly a strong feeling about the product\n\nat Microsoft."   \n\n  Imara Chairman Stephen Sutherland projects sales of &dollar;1.5\n\nmillion by February, 1991. \n\n  Although Sutherland acknowledges the estimate is " really low,"\n\nhe\'s quick to compare his 15-employee firm\'s product to other leading\n\npersonal computer programs, such as Aldus Corp.\'s Pagemaker, the breakthrough\n\ndesktop publishing program, and Wordperfect Corp.\'s Wordperfect, the\n\nlongstanding word processor of choice in many companies. \n\n  " The fact that there are high-end systems\n\navailable, just legitimizes the need for the technology."   \n\n\n\n\n\n  Indeed, most of the scientists working on the new technology say\n\nthat they have merely crossed the frontier of an exciting new concept.\n But Jacobson predicts that virtual-reality products will be\n\navailable to such commercial users as architects and engineers within five\n\nyears, while mass-market consumer entertainment products will be available\n\nwithin a decade.\n But given the rate at which previous computer revolutions have\n\noccurred, virtual reality could become a commonplace technology much sooner\n\nthan that.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a192bc61-ec58-42d0-944f-b95e11bfb9ab', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.857293+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9497086405754089, 'non_english_score': 0.050291359424591064}
{'text': 'UNHEALTHY BUILDINGS: Experts say indoor air can make people sick\n\n\n\n  Early in 1989, several federal civil servants working in a\n\nMontreal office tower began complaining about headaches, fatigue and nausea.\n According to some reports, several employees fainted at their desks,\n\nrecalls Tedd Nathanson, an Ottawa-based engineer with the federal department\n\nof public works.\n He said that he inspected the building and discovered that automobile\n\nexhaust fumes from the underground parking garage were penetrating the\n\noffices because the owner of the building had boarded up the underground\n\nventilation system to save money.\n Although the source of that problem was unusual, concerns about air\n\nquality in the workplace are becoming increasingly common.\n Indeed, almost 1,300 scientists, doctors and businessmen from 30\n\ncountries met in Toronto last week for a six-day conference aimed at\n\nimproving air quality in homes and offices. \n\n  Indoor air quality began to emerge as a health issue during the\n\nlate 1970s when builders across North America and Europe started installing\n\nsealed windows, which cannot be opened, as an energy conservation measure in\n\nalmost all new office towers, hospitals and schools.\n Experts attending the Toronto conference said that air delivered\n\nthrough ventilation systems frequently becomes contaminated with pollutants\n\nfrom inside and outside the building.\n When workers begin complaining about headaches, fatigue and other\n\nailments, they are suffering from what experts call " sick-building\n\nsyndrome." Said Douglas Walkinshaw, an Ottawa-based consultant who led the\n\nToronto conference:  " Most people now work in airtight buildings, so\n\nit is becoming a very big issue."  \n\n  Just how big was apparent at the meeting, where participants\n\ndelivered 530 research papers on indoor-air quality.\n By comparison, there were only 50 papers at the first conference on\n\nindoor air, which was held in Copenhagen in 1978 and which attracted only 230\n\ndelegates.\n The combination of research and actual investigations of buildings\n\nwith air-quality problems has revealed dozens of potential sources of\n\npollution.\n Said Ole Fanger, a Danish air-quality expert and organizer of the\n\nfirst conference:  " It was always assumed that buildings were clean.\n\n\n  New buildings, or structures that have been renovated or\n\nrefurbished, can contain dozens of pollutants called volatile organic\n\ncompounds, according to Walkinshaw.\n Many of the compounds, including benzene, toluene and octane, are\n\nderived from petroleum and are used in the glues applied to upholstery, tiles\n\nand carpets.\n Moisture within a building is a second source of airborne\n\ncontaminants, Walkinshaw said.\n Dirty humidifiers, condensation on pipes and wet carpets become\n\nbreeding grounds for such micro-organisms as moulds and fungi. \n\n  In most sealed buildings, only about 20 per cent of the air\n\ncirculating at any given time is actually fresh from outside, said\n\nWalkinshaw.\n The remainder is merely being recirculated, even when it is\n\ncontaminated by volatile organic compounds or micro-organisms.\n Walkinshaw said that the problem can be compounded if building\n\noperators shut off their ventilation systems altogether at night or during\n\nweekends, in order to save energy - or money. \n\n  In some cases, poorly designed ventilation systems can lead to\n\ncontaminated air.\n Nathanson said that his department inspected an office tower in\n\nOttawa recently after numerous employees complained about stale air and\n\nillness.\n Public works inspectors eventually discovered that the air intake\n\nduct and the exhaust duct, both of which measured six feet by 12 feet, were\n\nside by side on the roof.\n About 25 per cent of the air that was pumped out of the building\n\nthrough the exhaust was being sucked back in through the intake duct.\n Nathanson said that the flaw was corrected by building a barrier\n\nbetween the two ducts. \n\n  Some medical experts who have studied sick-building syndrome\n\ncontend that contaminated indoor air rarely poses a serious threat to an\n\nemployee\'s health.\n Sherwood Burge, a British doctor who attended the Toronto conference,\n\nsaid that the real problem is the comfort and productivity of office workers.\n He and fellow British physician Alastair Robertson conducted a study\n\nin which they circulated questionnaires to 4,000 workers based in 47\n\nbuildings in Great Britain.\n Burge said that employees in sealed buildings reported three times as\n\nmany health problems, including headaches, runny noses and fatigue, as their\n\ncounterparts in buildings where the windows could be opened.\n " The symptoms are not particularly disabling."\n\n \n\n  According to some of the delegates, solutions to sick-building\n\nsyndrome are just beginning to emerge as a result of research conducted\n\nduring the past decade.\n Burge said that architects and engineers should begin designing\n\nbuildings that allow the occupants some measure of individual control over\n\nheat and lighting.\n For his part, Fanger said that he is part of an eight-member European\n\nCommunity task force set up to develop new ventilation guidelines.\n " It will take a complete change in our philosophy\n\nand thinking about buildings." \n Clearly, it will take some strong medicine to cure the sick-building\n\nsyndrome that has become such a prevalent problem.  \n\n\n Re-creating reality: a new development has tantalizing\n\napplications \n\n  Michael McGreevy says that he will walk on the planet Venus\n\nwithin the next two years.\n But he plans to do it without leaving his laboratory in California\'s\n\nSilicon Valley.\n McGreevy, a 40-year-old research scientist with the National\n\nAeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA), is one of dozens of American\n\nand Japanese scientists racing to perfect a newly developed computer\n\ntechnology called virtual reality.\n The technology involves the use of computers to create full-color,\n\nthree-dimensional images of everything from molecules to planetary surfaces.\n And rather than merely looking at the images, scientists are using\n\nheadgear resembling scuba diving masks equipped with image-bearing screens to\n\nenter the so-called virtual realities and even manipulate their contents.\n There are also potentially tantalizing applications for the\n\nentertainment industry.\n Some theorists predict that people who now watch steamy TV sex videos\n\ncould instead experience the sensation of participating in them. \n\n  Proponents of virtual reality contend that within 10 years, the\n\ntechnology will have a profound influence on the work of architects,\n\nengineers and urban planners.\n They will be able to translate blueprints and plans for buildings,\n\nairplanes and expressways into lifelike, 3-D images that the designers or\n\nusers can simulate entering to explore and change before construction begins.\n Surgeons may be able to put themselves inside the human body, while\n\nother scientists will be able to explore room-sized models of molecules.\n Said Robert Jacobson, associate director of the Seattle-based Human\n\nInterface Technology Laboratory, which is devoted solely to developing\n\nvirtual reality:  " It\'s a fabulous idea.\n\n\n  But other experts predict that virtual reality could lead to the\n\nproblems foreseen by Vancouver author William Gibson in his award-winning\n\n1984 novel Neuromancer.\n The book deals with a young man in a futuristic society who becomes\n\nobsessed with a virtual-reality fantasy world called  " cyberspace."\n\n\n Louis ( Bo) Gehring, a Toronto-based computer graphics expert who is\n\nworking on virtual-reality projects for the U.S. air force, said,  "\n\nWhen you look at the impact video games have already had on kids and compare\n\nthem to the quality of cyberspace, you cannot overstate the potential\n\nimpact."  \n\n  People who have sampled virtual reality describe it as a powerful\n\nexperience.\n David Cohn, a senior editor with the Vancouver-based magazine\n\nCADalyst, a publication for specialists in computer-aided design, said that\n\nhe has entered the world of virtual reality four times.\n Once, during a demonstration at a Boston hotel, he wore a headpiece\n\nthat resembled a diving mask and rode a stationary exercise bike that was\n\nhooked up to a computer that produced images of outdoor scenes.\n Cohn said that when he began pedalling, he felt he had actually\n\nentered the computer-generated environment.\n The harder he pedalled, the faster the bike appeared to travel.\n When he reached 25 m.p.h., the bicycle actually left the ground in\n\nthe artificial environment and he felt as though he were flying.\n Said Cohn: " It was wonderful.\n\n\n  Still, some computer scientists dismiss the technology\'s\n\nentertainment potential and its addictive possibilities.\n They maintain that it will be a valuable tool for professionals in\n\nseveral different fields.\n Jacobson said that urban planners could translate proposals for\n\nexpressways into 3-D virtual-reality freeways, then change routes and\n\nsimulate traffic-flow patterns as they would be now or years into the future.\n Said Jacobson: " You need a visceral experience in order to\n\nappreciate traffic congestion.\n\n\n \n\n Computer scientists and doctors at the University of North Carolina at\n\nChapel Hill have used virtual reality to study the accuracy and impact of\n\nX-ray treatment beams used to destroy tumors in human patients.\n Frederick Brooks, a computer scientist at the university, said that\n\nthey generated images of internal human organs.\n Doctors then simulated entering the artificial realities by putting\n\non special headgear.\n They could then watch as computer-generated X-ray treatment beams\n\nentered the body from different directions and attacked the tumor.\n Brooks said that the purpose of the experiment was to determine\n\nwhether doctors could aim the beams more accurately so that they would\n\ndestroy the tumor without damaging other body organs. \n\n  Apart from its potential for improving medical treatment or the\n\ndesign of earthly structures, virtual reality could be a valuable tool in\n\nspace exploration.\n NASA\'s McGreevy said that he plans to create virtual-reality images\n\nof Venus using data collected by an unmanned NASA spacecraft currently\n\ntravelling towards the planet.\n " We will be able to re-create the surface of\n\nVenus in virtual reality and explore it almost as you would your office."\n\n \n\n  McGreevy said that the technology may be used on a manned mission\n\nto Mars that NASA hopes to undertake by the year 2019.\n He said that after landing on Mars, astronauts could send an unmanned\n\nrover out from the spacecraft to explore the surface for miles around.\n With virtual-reality images of the Martian surface, produced on the\n\nbasis of previously collected data, astronauts could see in advance what kind\n\nof terrain the rover would be crossing and guide it around any hazards.\n The rovers would also be equipped with video cameras, which would\n\ncomplement the virtual-reality images. \n\n  But before virtual reality can be used on an everyday basis,\n\nscientists say that they will have to greatly improve the technology for\n\ncreating computer-generated imagery.\n Brooks described the images of human organs generated at the\n\nUniversity of North Carolina as  " pretty crude, Saturday-morning\n\ncartoon quality." \n Stephen Hines, research director at a Los Angeles company called 3-D\n\nImageTek Corp., added that even the best color images currently lack detail\n\nor any shading. \n\n  According to Hines, time delays that occur when using the\n\nexisting technology are another problem.\n His firm\'s virtual-reality headgear is equipped with a sensor that\n\ninforms the computer of the location and position of the user.\n If he were to take three steps forward, the computer would have to\n\nproduce new images to show how a building or human organ might look from his\n\nnew position.\n But so far, computers cannot produce color images fast enough to keep\n\nup with human movements.\n As a result, the viewer sees a jerky or choppy movement in virtual\n\nreality, said Hines. \n\n  According to Gehring, who is working with American military and\n\ncivilian scientists, the U.S. air force has developed the most sophisticated\n\nvirtual-reality equipment to date in an attempt to reduce the clutter and\n\ncomplexity of the cockpits in modern fighter aircraft.\n " look\n\nlike a Swiss clock shop gone berserk.\n There are typically as many as 200 displays and switches."\n\n \n Since 1982, the air force has been trying to develop a system that\n\nwould allow a pilot to fly highly complex aircraft on the basis of an\n\nartificial reality presented to him through his headgear.\n Rather than dealing with a confusing instrument panel, the pilot\n\nwould be immersed in computer-generated images of the landscape beneath him\n\nand computer symbols projected into his field of vision.\n The headgear would also contain 3-D sound so that the pilot could\n\ndetermine with greater speed and precision the position of other planes in\n\nhis squadron or incoming enemy missiles.\n But Gehring said that the development of such a system would not be\n\ncomplete until the mid-1990s at the earliest.  <O> untranscribed text <O>\n\n <O> untranscribed text <O>\n Its most prized customer has been NASA.\n Benman conceded that VPL\'s equipment is so

{'text': 'THE CLEAN CAR QUEST: Los Angeles promotes electric automobiles\n\n\n\n  Since they first appeared in 1888, vehicles powered by electricity\n\nhave risen and fallen in public popularity.\n But many experts now say that electric cars will make a comeback over\n\nthe next decade as North Americans and Europeans become increasingly\n\nconcerned about air quality and other environmental issues, as well as rising\n\noil prices.\n Earlier this year, Detroit-based General Motors Corp.(GM) unveiled a\n\nprototype of a sleek-looking electric car called the Impact.\n Last month, the city of Los Angeles, along with a private utility,\n\nagreed to invest &dollar;8 million in the development of electric vehicles.\n Their goal is to put 1,000 electric cars on Los Angeles roads by 1992,\n\nwith another 9,000 by 1995.\n Ont.\n\n  Ontario   - based VEHMA International, a division of\n\nauto-parts maker Magna International, began assembling 60 electric vans.\n Two major Canadian electrical utilities and more than 20 U.S.\n\nutilities have agreed to purchase the vehicles in order to test their\n\ncapabilities.\n Said Jack Kerr, president of the Electric Vehicle Association of\n\nCanada in Mississauga,    Ontario   :  "\n\nIt\'s sort of the hush before the storm."  \n\n  Proponents say that, for the first time in decades, a combination\n\nof political, economic and environmental forces have made electric vehicles\n\nan attractive alternative to gasoline-powered automobiles.\n 2\n\ninvasion of Kuwait has pushed up gas prices in Canada between two and five\n\ncents a litre.\n U.S. prices have jumped by six to eight cents a litre, and\n\ninternational prices from 10 to 12 cents a litre.\n And increased concern about air pollution has led to strict clean-air\n\nlegislation, especially in such huge urban centres as Los Angeles, and a\n\nsearch for automobiles that do not produce harmful emissions.\n Still, some experts maintain that consumers will be reluctant to\n\nswitch to electric cars until researchers develop a battery capable of\n\npowering a vehicle beyond the current limit of about 160 km before a recharge\n\nis necessary.\n Declared Mark Nantais, executive director of the Toronto-based Motor\n\nVehicle Manufacturers Association:  " I don\'t see gas going by the\n\nwayside or a long time yet because it\'s a very good fuel and the current\n\ntechnology is based on gasoline."  \n\n  But it has not always been that way.\n At the turn of the century, 38 per cent of the automobiles in the\n\nUnited States were powered by electricity, 22 per cent used gasoline, and the\n\nrest were steam driven.\n Then, as now, electric cars were almost silent and required little\n\nmaintenance.\n By 1912, there were nearly 34,000 electric vehicles in use in the\n\nUnited States alone, compared with about 20,000 automobiles powered by\n\ninternal-combustion engines.\n But by the end of the Second World War, electric vehicles had almost\n\ncompletely disappeared from North American roads.\n Motorists had given up on the vehicles because they could only be\n\ndriven a maximum of about 65 km before a recharge.\n As well, they could reach a top speed of only 32 km/h, while\n\ngas-powered vehicles could easily attain speeds of 140 km/h. \n\n  Many of the problems associated with electric vehicles during the\n\nfirst half of the century still have not been entirely resolved.\n Although more powerful batteries are now available, even the best\n\nelectric vehicles remain limited, and it takes an average of six hours to\n\nfully recharge the batteries.\n As a result, most automotive experts argue that electric cars would\n\nbe useful solely in urban areas.\n Even then, motorists would require a network of service centres where\n\nthe vehicles could be conveniently recharged.\n Prolonged testing of electric vehicles has also shown that the\n\nbatteries must be replaced at about 80,000 km, or once every four to five\n\nyears, which could cost &dollar;1,500 for a car and up to &dollar;7,000 for a\n\nvan.\n However, scientists in Europe and North America are looking for\n\nalternatives to the current lead-acid batteries in order to increase the\n\nrange and versatility of electric vehicles. \n\n  In the past decade, growing public concern over air pollution,\n\nmuch of it caused by internal-combustion engines, has led to renewed interest\n\nin electric cars.\n According to the Washington-based Environmental Protection Agency (\n\nEPA), many U.S. cities regularly exceed the federal clean air standard of\n\n0.12 parts per million of ground-level ozone, a gas contained in automobile\n\nexhausts and the principal component of smog.\n In Los Angeles and the adjoining communities of San Bernardino,\n\nOrange County and Riverside County, where there are eight million registered\n\nautomobiles, ozone levels exceeded the EPA guidelines on 127 days last year.\n EPA monitoring frequently revealed ozone levels at triple the\n\nguidelines. \n\n  With its severe air-quality problems, Los Angeles has become one\n\nof the first major urban areas in North America to promote the development\n\nand use of electric cars.\n Last year, the South Coast Air Quality Management Board, a California\n\nregional agency that establishes air-quality standards for much of southern\n\nCalifornia, ordered that average daily ozone levels in the Los Angeles basin\n\nmust meet the EPA standards by the year 2010.\n To address the problem, the Los Angeles department of water and power\n\nand Southern California Edison, a private utility that supplies electricity\n\nto the basin, agreed to spend &dollar;8 million over a period of five years\n\nto finance the design and development of an electric car. \n\n  After reviewing proposals from 19 companies, the City of Los\n\nAngeles and Southern California Edison on    September\n\n  6 signed an agreement with Swedish-based Clean Air Transport, which\n\nhas developed a vehicle called the LA 301.\n Clean Air was founded in 1988 and is backed by British, American and\n\nSwedish investors.\n Its four-passenger electric car is designed to travel at top speeds\n\nof 115 km/h for distances of between 100 km and 115 km before requiring a\n\nrecharge.\n Jerry Enzenauer, who is managing the program on behalf of Los\n\nAngeles, said that the car would likely sell for about &dollar;29,000\n\ninitially, but that the price would come down as more cars are produced.\n Prototypes for the vehicles are currently in production at Clean\n\nAir\'s plant in Sweden.\n Enzenauer said that both the city and Southern California Edison plan\n\nto add about 30 of the vehicles to their fleets. \n\n  Meanwhile, the Big Three automakers, General Motors, Ford Motor\n\nCo. and Chrysler Corp., devote what analysts regard as a minor portion of\n\ntheir annual development budgets to electric vehicles.\n GM\'s Impact is based on the engineering and design of its solar car,\n\nthe Sunraycer.\n With a range of about 190 km, the 2,200-lb. car can maintain an\n\naverage speed of 90 km/h on a highway, it can accelerate from zero to 100\n\nkm/h in eight seconds and it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h.\n The car includes a built-in recharging system, and the 870-lb.\n\nbattery pack, which houses 32 lead-acid batteries, can be almost completely\n\nrecharged in two hours.\n But GM officials refused to comment about the company\'s production\n\nplans or the projected cost of the Impact. \n\n  At the same time, the company is also working with VEHMA and has\n\ndeveloped the electric G-Van, 60 of which will be produced in Newmarket, 25\n\nkm north of Toronto, before the end of this year.\n GM has supplied the frames for the vans, while VEHMA is assembling\n\nthe vehicles.\n The vans have already been sold primarily to utilities in the United\n\nStates and Canada, including three to Hydro Quebec and five to Calgary-based\n\nTransAlta Utilities Corp.\n The utilities will use the vans primarily for demonstration purposes.\n " The initial buyers are really benevolent customers,"\n\n explained David Sedgwick, the general manager of Powerplex, VEHMA\'s\n\nresearch and development arm.\n " They understand the cost of the vehicles isn\'t really\n\ncompetitive with internal-combustion vehicles but they want to get involved."\n\n \n The vans, which will initially cost &dollar;57,500, have a range of\n\nabout 95 km, with a top speed of 90 km/h, and their lead-acid batteries\n\nrequire about eight hours for a complete recharge. \n\n  Ford, too, has been working on electric vehicles during the past\n\neight years and the company currently has 10 vehicles out in test fleets in\n\nthe Washington area.\n\n\nConneticut   - based General Electric Co. and several major battery\n\nmanufacturers.\n Since 1982, the company has spent about &dollar;23 million on the\n\nproject.\n John Jelinek, product information manager at Ford Motor Co. of Canada\n\nin Oakville,    Ontario   , says that there is a\n\ngood chance the electric vehicles will be widely available to consumers early\n\nin the next century in metropolitan areas.\n Ford\'s demonstrator electric vehicles, five vans and five cars, can\n\ntravel about 160 km without a recharge to the battery.\n " That\'s great if you\'re in Metro Toronto," says Jelinek.\n " So we see it as being an answer in urban areas."\n\n \n He predicted that electric-powered vehicles will not be significantly\n\nmore expensive than gas-powered cars. \n\n  Chrysler appears to be making a smaller commitment to electric\n\nvehicle research than either Ford or GM, and officials with the company\n\nexpress less optimism about the technology than their counterparts at the\n\nother two companies.\n Chrysler is participating in a joint venture with the Electrical\n\nPower Research Institute in Palo Alto,    California\n\n  , to develop and test five electric-powered vans.\n " We\'re not convinced that there\'s a market out there,"\n\n said Chrysler media relations officer Anthony Cervone.\n " Is there a supplier base out there for batteries?\n Is there one for electric power?\n Electric vehicles seem like the end-all from an emissions\n\nstandpoint, but electric companies will have to work around the clock." \n\n \n\n  But several Canadian, European and American companies are working\n\nto develop solutions to the roadblocks facing the vehicles.\n Ford, Powerplex and the West German electrical engineering company\n\nAsea Brown Boveri are all testing sodium-sulphur batteries.\n According to Sedgwick, there are 30 vehicles in Europe and Canada\n\nusing the batteries, and their performance has been encouraging.\n Sodium-sulphur can store three to four times the energy of lead-acid,\n\nwhich means that a car powered by sodium-sulphur batteries could travel about\n\n385 km without a recharge.\n But Sedgwick added that one of the problems with the batteries, which\n\nare still in the prototype stage, is that they only last a year or two. \n\n  Despite the growing evidence that internal-combustion engines are\n\ncontributing significantly to air pollution in urban areas, most experts\n\nagree that electric-powered vehicles do not represent a quick and simple\n\nsolution yet.\n The range of the cars is too limited, the battery replacement costs\n\ntoo high, and the cars themselves are expensive.\n But most advocates of electric cars argue that if the vehicles were\n\nmass-produced, they would be cost-competitive with conventional vehicles.\n " We\'re moving in the direction of electric vehicles,"\n\n said Nantais.\n " But it all rests on whether the public creates that\n\ndemand."  \n Until the auto industry produces an electric vehicle that runs as\n\nefficiently - and as inexpensively - as gas-powered automobiles, it will take\n\nsome time to convince consumers that what was popular in the early 20th\n\ncentury is also the wave of the future.  \n\n\n\n\n  1, only two weeks\n\nafter technicians in Goose Bay, Labrador, began testing a mobile incinerator,\n\na power interruption caused an exhaust fan to fail.\n As a result, 18 workers were exposed to the fumes from burning\n\npolychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs), a suspected carcinogen.\n Then, in mid-April, a cooling-system failure caused parts of the\n\nincinerator to melt.\n\n\nAlberta   , also stopped functioning last November because of\n\nwater-pressure problems.\n Environment Canada officials said that none of the accidents exposed\n\ntechnicians to health risks.\n But the mishaps threatened a program aimed at destroying PCBs that\n\nare stored in many parts of Canada.\n Federal officials said that publicity about the accidents could make\n\nit difficult to find communities willing to act as test sites for the\n\nprogram, under which Ottawa hopes to destroy thousands of tons of PCBs by the\n\nend of 1993.\n Said Steve Hart, director of Environment Canada\'s waste-management\n\nbranch:  " There is no question, the breakdowns will slow down the\n\nprocess."  \n\n  Since August, 1988, when a fire in a PCB warehouse forced the\n\nevacuation of more than 3,000 people in St-Basile-le-Grand,  \n\n Quebec   , Ottawa has been working on plans to destroy stockpiles\n\nof PCBs that are stored at more than 3,000 government-controlled locations\n\nacross the country.\n To overcome objections in many communities to PCBs being destroyed\n\nlocally, then-federal Environment Minister Thomas McMillan unveiled a plan in\n\n1988 to use portable incinerators that could be temporarily installed in\n\ncommunities to burn PCBs in the area.\n Now, federal officials say that they fear that the accidents could\n\nthreaten public acceptance of the program.\n Gregory McGuire,\n\nproject manager for the Goose Bay test program, which is being conducted at\n\nthe nearby Canadian Armed Forces base:  " One of the things we\n\nprobably did wrong was to leave the impression that this would run without a\n\nhitch.\n\n\n  Although they were never manufactured in Canada, 40,000 tons of\n\nPCBs were used across the country, mainly as coolants and insulators in\n\nelectrical equipment, between 1929 and 1977.\n A series of studies in

{'text': 'In 1984, John Persaud was fired from Consumers Distributing\'s\n\ncentral warehouse in Malton, a suburb north of Toronto.\n He was then chief steward in the Teamsters Local 419 representing\n\nwarehouse employees.\n The labour relations climate at work was set by a personnel\n\nmanager who frequently referred to non-white employees as  " jungle\n\nbunnies"  and  " turban heads."  \n\n  Now more than five years later, the Ontario Human Rights\n\nCommission is expected to conclude hearings this spring on Persaud\'s\n\ncomplaint that he was fired because of racism. \n\n \n\nery scandal relating to secret payments to Sean Floyd, an official of\n\nLocal 419, who has stated that the money was paid by a company vice\n\npresident on behalf of the then company president Jack Stupp, who was \n\n" fully aware"  of the arrangements and  " wanted Persaud out\n\nof the picture while a new collective agreement was being negotiated."\n\n \n\n  In 1985, Consumers offered Persaud &dollar;50,000 to go away\n\nquietly, but he decided to hold out for re-instatement.\n " They had fired other ( non-white) people and paid them off in\n\nprivate settlements.\n I wanted to stop that," Persaud told the Toronto Star reporter\n\nJohn Deverell. \n\n  Two years ago, the company was sold to the Quebec-based Provigo\n\nInc. for &dollar;25 million.\n Persaud hoped the new management would repudiate the old\n\nmanagement\'s decision.\n Instead, Consumers paid a corporate fine of &dollar;125,000 for\n\nmaking the concealed payments to the union.\n Floyd went to jail for tax evasion, and a company official stood\n\ntrial.\n\n\n  The new management says race relations are greatly improved\n\nat the new plant, but they continue to fight Persaud\'s efforts to\n\nreclaim his job.\n and\n\nbringing him hack wouldn\'t be consistent with the company\'s efforts\n\n " to develop harmonious relations between labour and management."\n\n \n\n  Persaud, an immigrant of South Asian background via Guyana, has\n\nmaintained for more than five years that he was fired on false charges\n\nbecause of his vigorous opposition to racial harassment and discrimination at\n\nthe warehouse.\n He wants the human rights commission to make Consumers publicly\n\nadmit that the racial practices were wrong and return him to his job with\n\ncompensation for lost wages. \n\n  A coalition of anti-racist community activists grouped\n\naround the Cross Cultural Communications Centre and the Ontario Coa <l>\n\nlition of Black Trade Unionists has been supporting Persaud.\n They would like more support from unions.\n drawing\n\n \n\n\n\n\n  Writer June Callwood says it represents the hopes of us all.\n Architect Raymond Moriyania maintains it will become one of the\n\nmost important sculptures done in Canada in the 1990s. \n\n  It\'s the Canadian Tribute to Human Rights, a massive granite and\n\nconcrete sculpture under construction on Elgin Street in the heart of Ottawa.\n It\'s being built with contributions coming from communities all\n\nacross the country - including Punnichy, Saskatchewan, Ripo, Quebec, and\n\nNackawic, New Brunswick.\n Nearly &dollar;1 million ( about half that required) has been raised\n\nalready. \n\n  The tribute has been called the most significant national sculp\n\n<l> ture erected in the capital since the National War Memorial in 1939.\n Montreal artist Melvin Charney, who won a countrywide design\n\ncompetition, wants to juxtapose the tribute as a symbol of human rights and\n\npeaceful coexistence with the monument dedicated to those who died in wars.\n\n\n\n  Stylized figures bear granite tablets and a soaring arch carries\n\nthe inscription: " All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and\n\nrights."\n Inscriptions will be in braille, English, French and 53 aboriginal\n\nlanguages.\n The sculpture can be entered, on foot, in wheelchairs, or on\n\nskate-boards.\n Construction began last July, and the official dedication will be\n\nthis year. \n\n  Trade unionists are helping to create the tribute.\n The Canadian Labour Congress, the Confederation of National\n\nTrade Unions, the Canadian  Federation and most CLC\n\naffiliates and provincial federations and many labour councils have\n\ncontributed more than &dollar;10,000.\n Dennis McDermott, former CLC president, is a patron.\n CLC President Shirley Carr says: " In an era when human rights stand\n\nat the centre of many social and political debates in Canada, and are behind\n\nmany conflicts around the world, the tribute is a timely reminder that\n\nCanadians are concerned about, and deeply committed to, a vision of\n\nsocial justice based on respect for human rights."    \n\n\n\n\n  John Bullen, one of Canada\'s most gifted labour educators\n\nand promising social historians died in a car accident November 2.\n He was 37.\n Although John taught in some of this country\'s most prestigious\n\nuniversities, was published in respected journals, and worked with a great\n\nmany rising union leaders, it was his role as a down-to-earth and\n\nrank-and-file " Jimmy Higgins" of the New Democratic Party, the\n\nlabour movement, and the peace movement, that defined his life and its\n\ncontinuing importance.\n Working-class neighbourhood and family ( his father worked as a clerk\n\nin the post office, and his mother worked for Eaton\'s) shaped many of the\n\nchoices he made in life.\n Christian moral philosophy, especially the Golden Rule, was also\n\nimportant in providing him with a perspective that later developed into a\n\ndeep commitment to social justice.\n No longer a practicing Roman Catholic, he was an adherent of\n\nwhat he saw as the Catholic philosophy of life. \n\n  His philosophy was intimately related to music, an appreciation\n\nhe learned from his father who had played music in the popular 1950s radio\n\nshow, " The Happy Gang." But the link between music and his commitment to so\n\n<l> cial justice began with The Beatles and the music of the Woodstock\n\ngeneration.\n His friends called him the " fifth Beatle."\n The first words he taught his son Donovan were, " " John,\n\nGeorge, Paul, Ringo, and Cooperation." " He once spent a year\n\ntravelling across the country playing folk and rock \'n roll on his guitar,\n\nand he played gigs with several bands.\n John gave up his musical career for the life of a labour educator and\n\nhistorian, but he continued to play periodically and was a member of the\n\n union. \n\n  After graduating with a history degree from the University of\n\nToronto, he did an MA at the University of Ottawa, writing his thesis on\n\nthe history of the radical nationalist Waffle in Ontario.\n The Waffle remained a central interest of his, and he wrote\n\nshortly before he died that it  " prefigured many of the challenges\n\nthe NDP will face in the 1990s and beyond."  \n\n  Just months before his death, John completed his doctorate.\n His thesis, " Children of the Industrial Age: Children, Work,\n\nand Welfare in Late Nineteenth Century Ontario," is one of the finest PhD\n\ntheses ever written in the University of Ottawa\'s History Department.\n An analysis of the exploitation of children during the\n\ntransition to industrialism in the nineteenth century, this outstanding\n\ncontribution to Canadian social history is now being prepared for\n\npublication as a book. \n\n  His contributions as a teacher were even greater.\n Wherever he taught, at the CLC\'s Labour College of Canada, or at\n\nany of several universities, the students gave him the most enthusiastic\n\nevaluations.\n John\'s style was not to teach " at" students but to encourage\n\nthem to learn with him, in ways that were full of fun and humour - a relief\n\nfor those for whom learning about history had meant memorizing treaties, mili\n\n<l> tary battles and elections.\n Thanks to John, many of his students were able to " own" Canadian la\n\n<l> bour history as a part of their own identities. \n\n  Labour history for John was about collective struggle, often\n\nagainst big odds, and the struggle to form unions was a key part of that\n\nstruggle.\n He believed that it was a basic principle of the labour movement\n\nthat all workers, part-time and full-time, white collar and blue, should have\n\nthe right to join the union of their choice.\n He was shocked, therefore, to learn that his employer, the\n\nCanadian Labour Congress, refused to recognise the right of the teachers at\n\nthe labour college to form a union on the grounds that they were part-time\n\nworkers.\n John was also shocked to read national newspapers quoting Dennis\n\nMcDermott, then president of the CLC and chairman of the college\'s\n\nboard, calling the immensely dedicated teachers, most of them graduate\n\nstudents and labour activists,  " a bunch of high-priced academics\n\nplaying at being Joe and Jane Worker." \n\n\nteachers were irrelevant academics who  " study the underbellies\n\nof ants,"  according to McDermott at the time. \n\n  John led the teachers in their union recognition strike in the\n\nsummer of 1983.\n When the students walked out in support of the teachers, classes\n\ncontinued in the  residence.\n The strike seemed almost impossible to win, but John continued to\n\norganize in his own quiet, steady, and very stubborn way.\n Finally, thanks in large part to his efforts and the strong stand of\n\nthe students, many of whom had to confront intimidation from their own union\n\nleaders, the  union was recognised.\n John was elected president and he was very active in the union for\n\nthe rest of his life. \n\n  John was also active in the peace movement and in the NDP, where\n\nhe was a major figure in the Left Caucus in the late 1970s and early 80s, and\n\nwas one of the founders and editors of the newsletter Agenda.\n As a socialist and pacifist, John had a broad vision.\n He wanted a socialist society that would be genuinely democratic, not\n\na socialism controlled by intellectuals and bureaucrats, but one run\n\nfrom the " bottom up" - where the differences in power and privilege between\n\nthe bottom and the top were eliminated.\n His vision was not the product of the Old Left, and although he op\n\n<l> posed red-baiting and respected many Communists, to him the  "\n\nactually existing socialism"  of China and the Soviet bloc was not\n\nsocialism at all.\n Instead, his were the egalitarian and democratic values of the New\n\nLeft of the 1960s and 1970s, combined with basic ethical convictions derived\n\nfrom Christianity.\n These values, plus his natural skepticism and a self-deprecating\n\nsense of humour, gave him immunity to becoming a sectarian of any political\n\nline. \n\n  Most fundamental was his belief that his values were not for\n\nsome later, better time, but had to be embodied not only in what he wrote,\n\nand in his political and union activities, but also in his day-to-day\n\nrelations with everyone, particularly his family.\n John\'s wife, Catherine, and his sons, five-year-old Donovan and\n\nJoshua, seven months, were the heart of his life. \n\n  Friends are setting up the John Bullen Children\'s Trust for\n\nJoshua and Donovan.\n Those wishing to send contributions may send them to Anthony McGlynn,\n\nc/o Perley-Robertson, Panet, Hill and McDougall, 99 Bank St. Ottawa, Ont.

Even when the offender is punished, says Pedersen, a jail\n\nsentence is no deterrent since it\'s often viewed as a holiday: a free\n\ntrip to Yellowknife and free meals. \n\n \n\n  Instead, Pedersen says, a judge could forbid the offender to\n\ncome within 400 miles of the victim so contact would be impossible.\n In the North, the offender would be forced to go to another\n\ncommunity. \n\n  The concept of banishment is familiar to the Inuit culture,\n\nwhere ostracism was used as a control within a community. \n\n  Justice Minister Michael Ballantyne said restraining orders can\n\nbe put on people, but they would expire once the sentence is com <l>\n\nplete.\n " I\'m not sure the latitude within our justice system presently\n\nallows it," said Ballantyne. \n\n  MLA Tony Whitford ( Yellowknife South) said in an interview that\n\nhe doubts it would be legally possible to banish someone, based on a\n\nprecedent set in Saskatchewan. \n\n  Ballantyne added more education and dialogue should take place at\n\nthe broader community level, and not just initiated by the justice system.\n\n\n\n \n\n  " For who are we being reasonable?\n For the victim or the criminal?" he asked.\n " You say that longer sentences do not solve problems yet we are\n\nprepared to sentence the victims of these attacks, the women, to life in\n\nYellowknife." \n\n  " Society is unfair to the victim," says Tony Whitford.\n " I think society goes out of its way to protect people\'s\n\nrights, but in some cases I think they go too far to protect the rights of\n\nthe individual that has committed a crime." \n\n  Ballantyne says there are more resources going into a victims\n\nprogram this year and he will be looking at new ways to offer victims sup <l>\n\nport, such as counselling for job opportunities and legal recourse.  \n\n\n\n\n NEWS/NORTH\n\n  The territorial government has developed campaigns to\n\nencourage young people not to smoke, but the RCMP isn\'t backing them up

{'text': 'One of the key stumbling blocks to ending the constitutional\n\ncrisis appears to have been cleared. \n\n  Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the 10 provincial premiers have\n\ntentatively agreed on a sweeping formula that could eventually lead to an\n\nelected Senate. \n\n  Jim Horsman, Alberta\'s Intergovernmental Affairs minister, said\n\nthere is a proposal for Senate reform that has gained the approval of all the\n\nfirst ministers. \n\n  The Senate reform package calls for a special commission, made up\n\nof three representatives from the provinces and three from the federal\n\ngovernment, that would study and make recommendations on changes to the\n\nSenate.\n The commission would be instructed to consider an elected Senate as\n\nthe best option. \n\n  The new proposal, which appears to have the support of all 11\n\nfirst ministers, would replace the original Meech Lake Accord proposal that\n\ncalled for unanimous approval from Ottawa and the provinces for Senate\n\nreform. \n\n  If there is no agreement on how to change the Senate in the next\n\nseveral years - the timing appears to be still under discussion - the Senate\n\nwould be changed automatically.\n The Western provinces and Newfoundland would get 10 senators instead\n\nof six.\n Prince Edward Island would get one more senator for a total of five.\n\n\n  The senators would continue to be appointed, but under the Meech\n\nLake formula, which requires Senators for each province be appointed by the\n\nPrime Minister from a list of nominees from the province. \n\n  The country\'s first ministers also dealt with other aspects of a\n\nmulti-part proposal by the federal government that calls for the dissenting\n\nprovinces to accept Meech Lake by the June 23 deadline.\n After Meech is approved, the proposal would see the concerns of those\n\nopposed to Meech Lake addressed later. \n\n  The federal proposals found support from New Brunswick\'s Frank\n\nMcKenna, who said his legislature can now pass the constitutional accord\n\nproviding there is some clarification on the timing of the federal\n\ngovernment\'s package of proposals. \n\n  Meech Lake, which meets Quebec\'s conditions for signing the\n\nconstitution, calls for unanimous support from all the provinces in changing\n\nmajor institutions such as the Senate.  \n\n\n\n\n  Automaker General Motors of Canada Ltd. has warned 2,500 trim\n\nplant workers in Windsor, Ont., their jobs could be lost if they don\'t accept\n\nconcessions, the Canadian Auto Workers Union says. \n\n  An official of CAW Local 1973 says the concessions include\n\ndemands for productivity improvements that would eliminate 133 jobs at the\n\nplant. \n\n  GM Canada spokesman Nick Hall said 133 jobs " could very well be\n\nlost" under GM\'s contract proposals but refused to say if the plant\'s future\n\nhinges on approval of the concessions package. \n\n  He did stress the plant suffers from poor productivity, noting it\n\nis the only GM parts operation in Canada vulnerable to outside suppliers with\n\nhigher productivity.\n " We\'ve got to be competitive, and if you aren\'t, you lose work," he\n\nsaid. \n\n  The plant, which produces door and seat trim in cloth and leather\n\nand plastic panels for door interiors, could continue to lose business "\n\nuntil you\'ve got nothing left," Hall said. \n\n  Jim Morand, trim shop committee chairman at CAW Local 1973, said\n\nthe GM plant has just lost its Buick LeSabre seat business to a Japanese-U.S.\n\njoint-venture supplier in Mexico.\n He noted the union agreed to concessions in its last set of\n\nnegotiations in 1987 to win the LeSabre contract. \n\n  Morand said the union may also lose a contract for the luxury\n\nBuick Park Avenue car.\n\n\n  According to Morand, GM is seeking 14 concessions to make the\n\nWindsor trim plant competitive.\n He said 1,500 trim plant workers voted May 27 to reject GM\'s initial\n\nproposals, which included eliminating material handlers, consolidating jobs\n\nclassifications, ending five-minute wash-up periods and other changes\n\nintended to boost productivity.\n\n\n  The trim plant has been hailed by GM as a Canadian success story\n\nbecause of its synchronous manufacturing and just-in-time delivery\n\noperations.  \n\n\n\n\n  Montreal-based Steinberg Inc. yesterday confirmed industry\n\nspeculation that it has placed its Ontario Miracle Food Mart division on the\n\nblock. \n\n  The food retailer and real estate company, which was bought by\n\nSocanav

continue to\n\npost gains. \n\n  Big Three sales plummeted 21.9% to 104,094 units last month from\n\n133,281 units a year earlier.\n But so far none of the Big Three in Canada is predicting imminent\n\ntemporary production halts or layoffs such as the ones that hit the industry\n\nlast winter. \n\n  " With continued high interest rates, we anticipated a further\n\nsoftening of the automobile market," said Bill Atkinson, General Motors of\n\nCanada Ltd.\'s vice-president of marketing. \n\n  " too early to\n\ntell"  whether production halts will be necessary in the coming\n\nmonths.\n He said the big shutdowns earlier this year have kept inventories in\n\nline. \n\n  Chrysler Canada Ltd. spokesman Othmar Stein said high interest\n\nrates and the softening

particularly\n\nNewfoundland, see borrowing charges rise \n\n  The Meech Lake constitutional crisis is costing provincial\n\ngovernments, particularly Newfoundland, a great deal of money in borrowing\n\ncosts, Finance Minister Michael Wilson said yesterday  .\n\n  Wilson read to the House of Commons Finance Committee a chart\n\nthat shows spreads between 30-year government bonds and comparable U.S.\n\ngovernment treasury bonds have widened considerably in the past six months.\n\n\n\n  Government of Canada long bonds, for example, had a spread of 35\n\nbasis points over U.S. long bonds at the end of 1989.\n\n\n  For provinces with a shakier credit rating, such as Newfoundland,\n\nthe widening trend is more severe.\n Newfoundland 30-year bonds were trading 85 basis points above U.S.\n\nbonds in December and the spread has widened to 130 points in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n  " Clearly, there is something in the marketplace that is causing\n\nthese spreads to widen against comparable securities.\n And one of those things, I believe, is the concern, the uncertainty\n\nsurrounding Meech Lake.\n The result is any borrower in the United States market today will\n\nhave to pay more." \n\n  Recently, the Newfoundland government tried to float a bond issue\n\nin the U.S. with a spread of 110 basis points over U.S. bonds.\n The provincial government ended up issuing the bonds at a spread of\n\n120 basis points, Wilson said.\n The issue subsequently traded in the 135-140-basis-point range\n\nagainst comparable U.S. treasuries. \n\n  " And that has cost Newfoundland taxpayers a meaningful amount of\n\nmoney over the next 30 years," he added. \n\n  Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells is considered to be the\n\nstaunchest opponent of the Meech Lake Accord, a constitutional amendment\n\ndesigned to bring Quebec into the constitutional fold. \n\n  Spreads of other provinces against U.S. bonds have also widened\n\nconsiderably in the past six months - Quebec and Saskatchewan by about 40\n\nbasis points and Ontario by 20 points. \n\n  Wilson refused to comment on what will happen to interest rates\n\nin Canada if the provinces fail to reach an agreement on ratification of the\n\nMeech Lake Accord.\n The accord needs the consent of all 10 premiers to be ratfied by its\n\ndeadline of June 23.\n The premiers have been meeting in Ottawa to try to hammer out their\n\ndifferences before the deadline. \n\n  Wilson said he has also had anecdotal evidence of companies\n\nsaying they will not proceed with investment decisions in Canada until the\n\nMeech Lake crisis is sorted out  . \n\n\n\n\n  Canadian gas producers have received bad news concerning the\n\nprice of natural gas they want to sell to California this summer. \n\n  Alberta & Southern Gas Co. Ltd., marketer for a pool of 190\n\nCanadian gas producers, yesterday proposed a cut in the price it pays\n\nsuppliers for most gas shipped to California this summer. \n\n  A new, two-tier price scheme proposed by A & S will mean the gas\n\nmarketer will pay its suppliers roughly 10% less for gas shipped during the\n\ncoming contract year, says Jerry McLeod, executive vice-president of Pacific\n\nGas and Electric Co., A & S\'s parent and principal customer. \n\n  A & S expects its annual revenue from Alberta gas exports to fall\n\nto &dollar;760 million from &dollar;800 million, the company\'s executive\n\nvice-president, Donald Morland, told reporters. \n\n  For many years, California has been the most lucrative export\n\nmarket for Western Canadian natural gas.\n But market forces unleashed by the continent-wide gas industry\n\nderegulation have led to intense competition with U.S. gas suppliers and with\n\nother fuels, particular fuel oil. \n\n  McLeod said A & S is lowering the prices of some of the gas\n\noffered in its new gas purchase contract because the California Public\n\nUtilities Commission is pressing A & S\'s gas and electrical utility parent to\n\n " respond to lower gas prices available in Canada." \n Under its agreement with the California utilities commission, PG & E\n\nmust take steps to obtain the cheapest possible gas supply for California\n\nconsumers or risk financial penalties, he said.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'fac485b8-f510-450f-a778-3fe2061fff78', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.866581+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9584524035453796, 'non_english_score': 0.04154759645462036}

to rid the country of the type of weapon Marc Lepine used in the Dec.\n\n6 massacre at the Universite de Montreal\'s Ecole Polytechnique. \n\n  Delegates at the annual meeting of the Federation of Canadian\n\nMunicipalities yesterday approved a motion calling on the federal government\n\nto forbid the sale, possession and use of combat weapons. \n\n  Steered through the meeting by Montreal Mayor Jean Dore, the\n\nresolution was endorsed unanimously.\n\n\n  " What we want to ban are combat weapons or what are otherwise\n\ndescribed as assault weapons that are sold over the counter," Dore told\n\ndelegates. \n\n  The motion follows a similar one endorsed by Montreal council\n\nfollowing the massacre of 14 women at the school.\n Polytechnique students started a campaign to ban the weapons after\n\nthe shooting. \n\n  " take immediate action\n\nto forbid the sale, possession and use of military and paramilitary combat\n\nweapons in Canada with the exception of members of the Canadian Forces and\n\nlaw enforcement officers in the fulfilment of their duties."  \n\n  Dore said the rapid-fire rifles with large-capacity bullet clips\n\nare dangerous to have around, even in the hands of collectors. \n\n  The rifle Lepine used was a .226-calibre semiautomatic Sturm\n\nRuger with a 30-round clip. \n\n  In May, federal Justice Minister Kim Campbell told the Commons\n\nshe will introduce legislation to amend the existing firearms law.\n The announcement followed the presentation of a petition from\n\nstudents bearing 516,487 names. \n\n  She said she won\'t ban semiautomatic rifles but will ban the\n\nimport of military rifles that can easily be converted to rapid-fire. \n\n  Would-be gun-buyers would also have to find a " guarantor" and\n\nprovide more information to get a firearms acquisitions certificate. \n\n\n\n\n Leaders on verge of breakthrough; Talks resume today amid\n\noptimism; \n\n\n  OTTAWA - The first ministers appeared on the verge last night of\n\nbreaking the constitutional impasse over the Meech Lake accord. \n\n \n\n  The tentative deal would include a commission to make\n\nrecommendations on the creation of a Triple-E Senate.\n The deal also would call for a new preamble to the constitution with\n\na comprehensive definition of the fundamental characteristics of Canadian\n\nsociety - the so-called Canada clause. \n\n  The contentious issue of the distinct-society status accorded\n\nQuebec by Meech Lake has yet to tackled in detail, senior federal officials\n\nsaid last night. \n\n  The 11 leaders will meet again this morning for a fourth day of\n\nclosed-door bargaining. \n\n  After 13 hours of private negotiations yesterday, they filed out\n\nshortly before 10 p.m., most with smiles rather than the grim looks they\'ve\n\nshown for three days. \n\n  " We are a long way from any final arrangements but we have made\n\nsome progress," Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said.\n\n\n  Mulroney said the session could stretch all day today and perhaps\n\ninto tomorrow before the first ministers bring their bargaining into the\n\nopen. \n\n  " We have a long way to go," he said.\n\n\n  " I am pleased with the progress we made...\n I feel we are getting somewhere," said Manitoba\'s Gary Filmon, one of\n\ntwo premiers who have still refused to approve the accord.\n " We made progress on all areas and that is a major improvement."\n\n\n\n  Filmon and Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells want a commitment to\n\nSenate reform among other demands before they\'ll sign the accord by the June\n\n23 deadline. \n\n  Wells said last night " significant progress" was made.\n " The tone of the discussion all day was very, very good," he said.\n\n\n\n  However, Wells added: " Progress has been made but we are not\n\nthere yet." \n\n  " complete\n\npackage - that package is not there yet."  \n\n  Canadian Press said the plan for Senate reform, pushed by P.E.I.\n\nPremier Joe Ghiz, was apparently the brainchild of former Liberal cabinet\n\nminister Jack Pickersgill, who will turn 85 on June 23.\n That\'s the same day the accord expires if not ratified by holdout\n\nprovinces New Brunswick, Manitoba and Newfoundland. \n\n  According to the plan, Should no agreement arise from the\n\ncommission leading to a Triple-E Senate - equal, elected and effective - the\n\nfour western provinces and Newfoundland would each have their representation\n\nincreased to 10 senators from 6. \n\n  Ontario and Quebec - 24 each - and Nova Scotia and New Brunswick\n\n- 10 each - would keep their present number of senators and Prince Edward\n\nIsland would get one more, making five. \n\n  But Filmon and Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa said there were\n\nmany options discussed. \n\n  to say what the\n\nfinal solution for Senate reform will look like. \n\n  " made a step forward"\n\n to bringing the accord into law by the June 23 deadline.\n\n\n  " There was an air of optimism," Nova Scotia Premier John\n\nBuchanan said as the private session ended last night. \n\n  Alberta Premier Don Getty said confirmed that the first ministers\n\nare looking at a commission, with federal and provincial representatives, to\n\nstudy Senate reform.\n\n\n  Earlier, in the late afternoon, Mulroney said progress was\n\ncontingent on the settlement of other sticky issues yet to be tackled in\n\ndetail. \n\n  Mulroney didn\'t specify the issue on which progress was made.\n\n\n\n  Mulroney pointedly tried to counter the complaints of the two\n\nholdout premiers that their criticisms surrounding the Meech Lake accord are\n\nbeing ignored. \n\n  Mulroney said all the issues can\'t be dealt with at the same\n\ntime.\n " All the premiers who have concerns will have those concerns dealt\n\nwith," he said, then added: " Perhaps not to their entire satisfaction, or\n\nperhaps not to their satisfaction at all." \n\n  New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna said on Monday his complaints\n\nhave been largely satisfied by federal proposals. \n\n  " Premier McKenna came onside, which is a very important\n\ndevelopment," Mulroney said as yesterday\'s session began.  \n\n\n\n\n  QUEBEC - Doubters in the cabinet and stiff opposition from\n\nindustry could quash the government\'s bid to adopt a tough polluter-pay law,\n\nEnvironment Minister Pierre Paradis said yesterday. \n\n  Paradis said he expects representatives of the mining, petroleum\n\nand chemical industries to come out swinging when they appear before a\n\nlegislature committee examining Bill 65. \n\n \n\n  Paradis wouldn\'t reveal which cabinet members oppose the\n\nlegislation, but did say its foes are concerned the law might not stand up in\n\nthe courts. \n\n  Bill 65 would amend the province\'s Environment Quality Act,\n\nallowing the government to force polluting companies to clean up their\n\ncontaminated sites.\n If they refuse, the government could do it and send them the bill.\n\n\n\n  Penalties would include fines as high as &dollar;1 million, and\n\nthe government could seize a floundering company\'s assets as a preferred\n\ncreditor. \n\n  The cabinet has taken the unusual step of asking to study the\n\nlegislation one last time before it is sent to the National Assembly for a\n\nvote.\n That would give the bill\'s opponents more time to lobby for changes.\n\n\n\n  " You\'re not going to have legislation that is ahead of most\n\nother jurisdictions without having that kind of fight," he said.\n " But that\'s part of the job of the minister of the environment."\n\n\n\n  Paradis says he\'s counting on public support to push the law\n\nthrough by the end of the current session. \n\n  In tabling the bill in May, Paradis admitted he was venturing\n\ninto delicate legal areas involving property rights, the civil code and the\n\ncharters protecting the rights of persons. \n\n  Environmental lawyers have told The Gazette the law would not\n\nwithstand legal challenges, because Quebec\'s civil code clearly specifies\n\nproperty rights. \n\n  Opponents of the bill outnumbered supporters yesterday at the\n\ncommittee hearings. \n\n  Pierre Gosselin, an official with Quebec\'s community health\n\ndepartment network, told the committee the bill\'s mechanics need work.\n " More businessmen will go under or flee to Florida and eventually\n\nthe minister ... will find businessmen unable to pay," he said. \n\n  , the province\'s largest\n\n group, said the bill\'s coercive measures leave little\n\nroom for companies to collaborate with the government in cleanups. \n\n  It said the costs associated with the bill are enormous, the\n\nfines too severe and the rules too vague. \n\n  Noting that corporations aren\'t the only ones responsible for\n\npollution, it said the law would have  " serious consequences on the\n\nfinancial health of enterprises and municipalities."  \n\n  Montreal would face special problems under the law, city\n\nexecutive committee chairman Michael Fainstat said in an interview yesterday.\n\n\n\n  Many Montreal firms inherited polluted sites and had nothing to\n\ndo with contaminating them, said Fainstat, who will appear at the hearings\n\ntomorrow. \n\n  He said the law might scare away plant owners, leaving the city\n\nstuck with tainted sites.  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Economic influence lies at the centre of power, a Canadian\n\nbanking official told about 1,000 delegates at a conference on women and\n\npower at the Palais de Congres yesterday. \n\n  " All the gains women have realized are a direct reflection of\n\neconomic power," said Joanne De Laurentiis, vice-president of the Canadian\n\nBankers Association. \n\n  " Without some economic independence, a person\'s ability to\n\nachieve is severely limited." \n\n  De Laurentiis was speaking at a conference forum on power and the\n\neconomy.\n The conference, the first international summit on women and power,\n\nruns through Friday. \n\n  Her remarks came on the same day as a former prostitute\n\nencouraged summit participants to move away from  " careerist"\n\n attitudes and address the day-to-day concerns of poor working women.\n\n\n\n  Laurentiis pointed out that women in the 19th century generally\n\nhad no property, capital or income, and were viewed as poor credit risks by\n\nbanks. \n\n  " This attitude persisted even after women began to enter the\n\nmarketplace in droves, and it played a part in delaying the economic growth\n\nof women," she said. \n\n  " Without access to credit, women could not leverage their income\n\nto expand businesses or make investment." \n\n  But she said the past 10 years have seen an enormous change, and\n\nnoted that in the 1980s women started as many new businesses as men did. \n\n  Women now own 23 per cent of the 900,000 businesses in Canada,\n\nDe Laurentiis said. \n\n \n\n<P>  The United States has more than 3 million woman entrepreneurs,\n\nsaid Marie Letourneau-Galanti, president of a French-language newspaper based\n\nin California. \n\n  The U.S. is an easy place to start a new business, but a\n\ndifficult spot to reconcile the needs of family and work, she remarked  .\n\n  " Our president, George Bush, recently rejected a proposed law\n\nthat would give women unpaid maternity leave because such a provision would\n\nrun counter to business interests," she said. \n\n  Men and women differ enormously in what they want when they go\n\ninto business for themselves, Letourneau-Galanti said.\n Men seeking wealth, while women want to create their own jobs and\n\nearn a living. \n\n  " I would like us to be more confident and aggressive and in\n\ncharge," she said. \n\n  Letourneau-Galanti said the chance to create a new business is a\n\ntool women can use any time they want to overcome the unequal distribution of\n\nwealth between men and women.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'UNIONDALE, N.Y. ( CP) - Guy Carbonneau scored 12:34 into overtime\n\nas the Montreal Canadiens defeated the New York Islanders 2-1 Thursday night\n\nto extend their playoff winning streak to a record-tying 11 games. \n\n  Montreal assumed a 3-0 lead in the NHL\'s best-of-seven Wales\n\nConference final and can advance to the Stanley Cup final with a win in Game\n\n4 Saturday night at the Nassau Coliseum. \n\n  Carbonneau cruised into the New York zone and smashed a 10-metre\n\nslapshot that went in off a leg pad of Islanders goaltender Glenn Healy. \n\n  It was Carbonneau\'s second overtime goal of the playoffs.\n He had the OT winner in Game 2 of the Adams Division final in which\n\nMontreal swept aside the Buffalo Sabres. \n\n  The 11th consecutive win tied the single-season record set last\n\nspring by both Chicago and Pittsburgh. \n\n  Two minutes into overtime, Pierre Turgeon went in on a breakaway\n\nbut shot over the Montreal net. \n\n  Vincent Damphousse forced overtime when he shot into an open part\n\nof the Islanders net from a scramble with 5:14 left in the third period. \n\n \n\n  It was the 22nd overtime game of the 1993 playoffs and the eighth\n\ntime in 13 playoff games that Montreal has needed extra time to decide a\n\nmatch. \n\n  The Canadiens now have won seven consecutive overtime playoff\n\ngames.\n They beat the Islanders 4-3 in double overtime in Game 2 Tuesday.\n\n\n\n \n\n  The Islanders, in their first home game since upsetting the\n\nStanley Cup-champion Pittsburgh Penguins in the Patrick Division final, were\n\ngreeted with a thunderous ovation from the capacity crowd of 16,297. \n\n  Both teams played true to their styles - a patient, checking game\n\nthat left little room for the offensive stars to skate. \n\n  The Islanders held Montreal to only 11 shots through the first\n\ntwo periods. \n\n  Turgeon had the best chance of the opening period when he was set\n\nup alone in the slot by David Volek, but Patrick Roy made the save. \n\n  Turgeon made no mistake on a similar setup from Brad Dalgarno at\n\n1:36 of the second period, registering his sixth goal of the playoffs. \n\n  All three penalties in the second period went against Montreal,\n\nbut the Islanders failed to mount sustained pressure with the man advantage.\n\n\n\n  The tight play continued until Damphousse fought off Darius\n\nKasparaitis behind the Islanders net and shovelled the puck out in front.\n\n\n\n  With Healy down in a wild scramble, Damphousse gained possession\n\nof a loose puck and backhanded it into the open net.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  VANCOUVER ( CP) - People should take vitamins to protect\n\nthemselves against heart disease, says a U.S. pharmacologist who has done a\n\nvitamin study on monkeys. \n\n  Anthony Verlangieri, director of the University of Mississippi\'s\n\natherosclerosis research who gave a lecture in Vancouver this week,\n\nstudied 36 monkeys for 10 years. \n\n \n\n  Verlangieri found that in the monkeys receiving vitamins, the\n\nincidence of blocked arteries was 50 per cent less than in those that did not\n\ntake vitamins. \n\n  " We also had groups in which we let the disease develop and then\n\ntreated to see if we could regress it or reverse it," he said. \n\n \n\n  " We see evidence of atherosclerosis in newborns and\n\nstillborns." \n\n  Arteries become more and more blocked over the years - not only\n\nbecause of the foods eaten but also because blood flow damages artery\n\nwalls, he said. \n\n \n\n  " In today\'s society, being exposed to more air and water\n\npollutants and pesticides, we are generating more free radicals in\n\nour bodies, so it is important to take these anti-oxidant vitamins to dis <l>\n\narm the free radicals," Verlangieri said. \n\n \n\n  Verlangieri said these amounts, which can be obtained through\n\nbalanced diet, merely assure health today. \n\n  He believes people should supplement their diet with 4,000 mg of\n\nvitamin C a day, 1,600 international units ( or 2,000 mg) of vita <l>\n\nmin E and 25-50 mg of beta-carotene.  \n\n\n\n\n  DARTMOUTH, N.S.

The New Brunswick government has refused to\n\nreconsider its lucrative video gaming program despite a recent death linked\n\nto a gambling addiction. \n\n  Mayor Brad Woodside of Fredericton, upset after learning of\n\nthe recovery of a friend\'s body from the waters by the Mactacquac Dam, said\n\nThursday he wants video gambling machines severely curtailed in the\n\ncity. \n\n \n\nNeil, 34, from a submerged car in the headpond Wednesday.\n\n\n  Woodside said MacNeil, who disappeared last week, was having\n\ndifficulties because of his addiction to video gambling  .\n\n  " You know, I think the problem is much more serious than the gov\n\n<l> ernment realizes and this is a tragedy that I don\'t want to see re\n\n<l> peated in this community," Woodside said. \n\n  " I\'ll call on the premier to take the necessary action to see\n\nthat it\'s not repeated." \n\n  Woodside would like to see is a\n\nban on gambling machines in all locations except bars. \n\n \n\n  He repeated his comment that the province\'s decision to bring the\n\nmachines out in the open and regulate them is a better way to control\n\nboth gambling and the social problems caused by gambling. \n\n  " What we\'ve done is bring it ( gambling) out of the closet, make\n\nit more open, and obviously you tend to hear more about it," said Maher. \n\n \n\ntions around the province.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  TORONTO ( CP) - Goaltending great Glenn Hall, whose face has\n\nstopped a hundred pucks, figures there\'s a simple explanation for the\n\nnetminding heroics during the current Stanley Cup playoffs. \n\n  From Felix Potvin to Kelly Hrudey to Patrick Roy to Glen Healy to\n\nthe stunning acrobatics of Curtis Joseph, the common thread is the confidence\n\nthat comes with being the No. 1 man. \n\n  " Generally, in the playoffs it\'s a one-goalie system and that\n\none-goalie system just breeds confidence," Hall said Thursday, after he and\n\nfive others were named as 1993 inductees into Canada\'s Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n  " When that confidence keeps growing, it\'s amazing what a\n\ngoaltender can do," added the 61-year-old native of Humboldt, Sask., who\n\nlooks none the worse for wear after an awe-inspiring NHL career that spanned\n\nthree decades ( 1952-71).\n Over 18 seasons, Hall appeared in 906 games ( 502 in a row at one\n\npoint) and sported a brilliant 2.51 goals-against average. \n\n  Also named to the hall in the athlete\'s category are marathon\n\nswimmer Cindy Nicholas, former World Cup skier Laurie Graham and former\n\nmajor-league pitcher Ron Taylor, now team physician for the Toronto Blue\n\nJays. \n\n  category are George Mara,\n\ncoach of the 1948 Olympic hockey gold medallists and a long-time\n\nadministrator of the Olympic Trust of Canada, and Bob Secord, a posthumous\n\ninductee who devoted most of his life to developing and advancing amateur\n\nsports programs in Ontario \n\n  The inductions will take place at an October dinner in Toronto.\n\n\n\n  Hall, dubbed Mr. Goalie, played junior hockey in Windsor, Ont.,\n\nand turned pro with the cross-river Detroit Red Wings.\n His glory days were spent with the Chicago Blackhawks and he joined\n\nthe expansion### St. Louis Blues in 1967-68. \n\n  Hall says there\'s no comparison between today\'s goaltenders and\n\nthose of his era. \n\n  " I think the goaltending now is better than it\'s ever been,"\n\nsaid Hall, who stays close to the action as a goaltending consultant to the\n\nCalgary Flames.\n " If they can get a look at it, they can stop it.\n\n\n  In typical self-effacing manner, he shrugged off the Hall of Fame\n\nhonor. \n\n  " I certainly don\'t know what I\'m doing here," he said at a\n\nnoon-hour news conference to announce the  inductees.\n " My old friend Gump Worsley used to say we weren\'t even players,\n\nteams were allowed to have 18 players and two goaltenders.\n\n\n  Graham, 33, won five World Cup downhills and a super-giant slalom\n\nduring her illustrious career.\n She won the Bobby Rosenfeld Award in 1986 as The Canadian Press\n\nfemale athlete of the year and was appointed to the Order of Canada two years\n\nlater.  \n\n\n\n\n  TORONTO ( CP) - This is nothing new for the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\n\n\n  They\'re into their third NHL playoff series, and they\'ve lost\n\nGame 2 in all three, including a 3-2 setback Wednesday night to the Los\n\nAngeles Kings. \n\n  " We\'re confident," says head coach Pat Burns.\n\n\n  " We have given them some life.\n We\'ll make some changes and find some ways and see what we can do."\n\n\n\n  With the Campbell Conference final knotted at 1-1, Game 3 goes\n\ntonight at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood, Calif. \n\n  " It\'s a best-of-five now," said Tony Granato, who, along with\n\nTomas Sandstrom and Mike Donnelly, scored for the Kings in Game 2.\n " They\'ve got a great club, a good road team, and if we\'re going to\n\nbeat them we\'re going to have to use our speed more." \n\n  The Kings could also use more from Wayne Gretzky and Luc\n\nRobitaille.\n\n\n  Gretzky has two assists, four shots on goal and is a minus-two,\n\nwhich means he\'s been on the ice for two more Toronto goals than Los Angeles\n\ngoals in the series.\n Robitaille has a grand total of one shot on Leafs goalie Felix Potvin\n\nin the series and also is a minus-two. \n\n  " When we get back to our building and our fans, it\'ll probably\n\ngive our guys a spark," said Kings coach Barry Melrose. \n\n  Throughout these 1993 playoffs, both the Kings and the Leafs have\n\nquickly bounced back from defeats with stellar performances. \n\n  " We have to keep our heads up," said Toronto captain Wendel\n\nClark.\n\n\n  Toronto hurt itself by taking 10 of the 17 penalties whistled\n\ndown by referee Don Koharski on Monday. \n\n \n\n  Neither team could ice a credible power-play unit Wednesday.\n\n\n  " We\'ll have to improve on it to stay in the series," said\n\nGranato. \n\n  Hrudey is well aware that the Leafs have played well on the road\n\nthis season. \n\n  " This doesn\'t solidify anything," he said of the win.\n\n\n  " The NHL has so much parity now.\n\n\n\n\n\n  MONTREAL ( CP) -

{'text': 'VANCOUVER ( CP) - Defensive lineman Brett Williams wept last\n\nSunday when the Edmonton Eskimos beat the Calgary Stampeders to advance to\n\nthe 1990 Grey Cup. \n\n  But Williams, who had two quarterback sacks against Calgary in the\n\nCFL\'s West Division final, says he\'ll be smiling all this week as the Eskimos\n\nprepare for Sunday\'s championship game at B.C. Place Stadium against the\n\nWinnipeg Blue Bombers. \n\n  " It\'s going to be a fun week, I\'m going to enjoy every day of\n\nit," he said, making his first appearance in the Grey Cup after losing in\n\nfour previous divisional finals as a member of the Montreal Concordes, B.C.\n\n\n  After the season the Eskimos have had - jumping to a 9-3 record,\n\nonly to finish at 10-8 and second in the West behind Calgary after losing\n\nfive of their last six - Williams said Edmonton has a new lease on life. \n\n  The Eskimos have withstood injuries to star slotback Tom Richards,\n\nNo. 1 running back Reggie Taylor, rush end Stew Hill and others, setbacks\n\nthat could have meant disaster. \n\n  They have also overcome reports of lack of leadership, an absence\n\nof team togetherness and a black-white rift on the team to advance to their\n\n12th championship appearance in 18 years. \n\n  " Now we\'re here and I guess it took until we got our backs\n\nabsolutely up against the wall," said Williams.\n " We were the same team the whole way along ... we really did feel we\n\ncould turn it on when it came time." \n\n " We didn\'t intentionally not play well, but when things happen to you\n\nlike they have the last few years - winning the West twice and not getting to\n\ngo to the Grey Cup - it makes you apprehensive." \n\n  The Eskimos won the West in 1989 with a 16-2 record, but lost to\n\nSaskatchewan in the division final.\n They also were division champions in 1988, but were bounced by the\n\nLions.  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n The Canadian Press\n\n  Russians were playing a form of hockey long before the game was\n\nembraced by Canadians, says a new book on the history of the sport in the\n\nSoviet Union. \n\n  that hockey\n\nwas played in Russia  " before the first recorded Canadian\n\nexhibition."  \n\n  In North America, it\'s generally recognized that hockey\n\noriginated from a game played by Englishmen on the frozen harbor at Kingston,\n\nOnt., in 1860.\n There are also claims that hockey - or hurley as it was known then -\n\nwas played in Nova Scotia as early as 1810. \n\n  " documentary evidence that\n\nRussians were playing the game in the middle of the 19th century"  in\n\nLeningrad, then known as St. Petersburg. \n\n  " We live under this myth that it is a Canadian game," Martin\n\nsaid in an interview from Ottawa, where he is a visiting lecturer at Carleton\n\nUniversity school of journalism. \n\n  Martin did research for the book while in Moscow as a\n\ncorrespondent for the Toronto  Globe and Mail  from 1985 to  . \n\n  The hockey he describes is more like bandy, a game thought to\n\nhave been born in England and played on ice with 11 players aside.\n and\n\nsticks with upward curving <unclear> unclear word </unclear> similar to those\n\nused for field hockey.  \n\n\n\n\n  EDMONTON ( CP) - Once in a long while, there is a story like\n\nMichael Bourgeau\'s to be told and retold during a Grey Cup week. \n\n  It is a story about a boy\'s triumph over a terrifying condition\n\nand a man\'s struggle to overcome a body that kept trying to quit on him.\n It\'s a story of perseverance which could be rewarded Sunday with a\n\nchampionship ring, against fairly incredible odds. \n\n  Bourgeau grew up in Montreal in a bilingual household believing\n\nhe could hear, when the truth was he could read lips in two languages well\n\nenough to fool everyone, including himself. \n\n  But then he didn\'t know what things were supposed to sound like.\n It was not until he was 12 years old that doctors discovered he was\n\nlargely deaf in one ear and partially deaf in the other. \n\n  " It\'s nerve deafness from birth," the 29-year-old defensive end\n\nsaid, still calm and low-key even after Sunday\'s 43-23 Western final victory\n\nover the Calgary Stampeders, his finest game as a member of the Edmonton\n\nEskimos. \n\n \n\n\n\n N.W. Times Service\n\n  NEW YORK - More than one-fifth of major league players earned\n\n&dollar;1 million or more this year, a salary survey determined yesterday.\n\n\n\n  The survey, based on contract data obtained from management and\n\nplayer sources, showed that the &dollar;1 million plateau was attained by 162\n\nplayers, or 22 per cent of the 735 who were on major league rosters or the\n\ndisabled list on Aug. 31.\n\n\n  For the first time, a player reached &dollar;3 million or more\n\nthis year, with Robin Yount of Milwaukee earning &dollar;3.2 million.\n Twenty-eight other players, up from 20 a year ago, hit or surpassed\n\nthe &dollar;2 million mark.  \n\n\n\n\n  BOSTON ( AP) - Roger Clemens was suspended for the first five\n\ngames of next season and fined &dollar;10,000 yesterday for behavior which\n\nled to the Boston pitcher\'s ejection from the last game of the American\n\nLeague playoffs. \n\n  The penalty, announced by AL president Bobby Brown, will force\n\nthe Red Sox star to miss one start.\n It came a week after he earned a &dollar;50,000 bonus for finishing\n\nsecond in the AL Cy Young Award voting and on the same day he earned another\n\n&dollar;50,000 for finishing third in the AL most-valuable-player voting.\n\n\n\n  Clemens was ejected by plate umpire Terry Cooney in the\n\nsecond inning of Oakland\'s 3-1 victory that completed the A\'s four-game sweep\n\nOct. 10. \n\n  The altercation occurred after Clemens walked Willie\n\nRandolph, giving the A\'s, who led 1-0, runners on first and third.\n Cooney and Clemens got into a shouting match, and Clemens,\n\ntrying to get closer to Cooney, bumped Evans. \n\n  After the game, Clemens and Cooney said that after Randolph\n\nwalked the pitcher shook his head. \n\n  Cooney said he said, " I hope you\'re not shaking your head at\n\nme."\n He said, \'if you want to talk to me, take your mask off.\'\n By me not removing my mask and not getting into a verbal thing with\n\nhim, that was my way of warning him." \n\n  " I was looking down," Clemens said.\n\n\nthing.\n He thought I was talking to him.\n I told him, \'I\'m not shaking my head at you.\n\n\n\n\n\n The Canadian Press\n\n  MONTREAL - The federal government is practising "\n\nwhite-collar terrorism" by allowing Quebec to split an environmental review\n\nof the James Bay 2 power project, a Cree chief said yesterday. \n\n  Romeo Saganash, executive chief the Grand Council of the Cree,\n\nreacted angrily to the federal government decision to allow Quebec to\n\nassess the environmental impact of a road and airports for the giant dam\n\nproject before they assess the impact of the dams themselve. \n\n  Quebec wants to build a 200-kilometre, &dollar;600-million\n\nroad into the isolated Great Whale River site next spring.\n To complete the megaproject on schedule, Quebec wants to begin\n\nbuilding the road in January. \n\n  The Cree oppose splitting the review, saying that once\n\nQuebec has spent &dollar;600 million on building roads and airports to reach\n\nthe site, the dams themselves will never be rejected on environmental\n\ngrounds. \n\n  " The agreement clearly states that hydroelectric projects and\n\ntheir      appurtenant   works are\n\nsubject to review," Saganash said, referring to the 1975 James Bay and\n\nNorthern Quebec Agreement signed by the Cree before James Bay 1 was built.\n\n\n\n  On Monday, Raymond Robinson, a senior federal Environment Depart\n\n<l> ment official, wrote to members of a committee studying the project to\n\nsay that the federal government acknowledged that Quebec has the right to\n\nstart building the road to the site before the dams themselves are approved.\n\n\n\n  The project would create vast reservoirs covering 4,387\n\nsquare kilometres of ancestral Cree land - flooding an area the size of\n\nPrince Edward Island. \n\n  Opponents fear it will destroy valuable wildlife habitat and\n\npoison waters with mercury generated by rotting vegetation. \n\n  " The white collar terrorism practised by Mr. Robinson is a\n\nnational scandal," Saganash told a news conference. \n\n  " We\'re asking for the resignation of Mr. Robinson and the\n\nresignation of ( federal Environment Minister) Robert de Cotret because these\n\npeople are no longer capable of assuming their responsibilities for\n\nthe protection of the environment," he said, flanked by two lawyers.\n\n\n\n \n\n  " We are quite distressed," said Helene Lajambe, a spokesman for\n\nthe James Bay Committee, a fledgling environmental group that op <l>\n\nposes expansion of the existing James Bay 1 complex. \n\n  " They\'ve opened the door to a fast-track process for Quebec\n\nHydro and they don\'t want to admit it," said Jim Fulton, the New Democrat\n\nenvironment critic.\n\n\n  Liberal environment critic Paul Martin said the federal\n\ngovernment clearly has jurisdiction over the project in spite of the 1975\n\nJames Bay Agreement. \n\n  " There really is considerable doubt whether this government has\n\nany backbone," he said. \n\n  De Cotret said the federal government can\'t prevent Quebec\n\nfrom building related structures before the environmental study of the dam is\n\nfinished. \n\n  " You can\'t stop any province from building a road if it\'s\n\nenvironmentally safe," he said outside the Commons. \n\n  Saganash said he will consult with the 10,000 Cree of Northern\n\nQuebec before deciding how to battle this latest setback in a fight to stop\n\nthe giant hydro project.  \n\n\n\n\n The Canadian Press\n\n  TORONTO - Ontario\'s first NDP government reheated its campaign\n\nmenu yesterday in a speech from the throne that promised to be mindful of a\n\ndeepening recession. \n\n  Premier Bob Rae repeated election promises for a new\n\ndriver-owned automobile insurance plan, wage protection for laid-off workers\n\nand a moratorium on constructing new nuclear plants. \n\n  But he also outlined the tough economic conditions facing his gov\n\n<l> ernment, already burdened with a &dollar;2.5-billion deficit. \n\n  " To come in after six weeks and announce \'Whammo\' we\'re going to\n\nspend here and spend there ... that would be irresponsible," Rae said before\n\nentering the provincial legislature. \n\n  Before about 500 spectators, including extra seats packed\n\ninto the chamber for invited guests such as Rae\'s father, Saul, and Rae\'s\n\nwife, Arlene Perly, Lt.-Gov Lincoln Alexander read the 17-page document\n\nwith dramatic flare. \n\n  " My government will open Queen\'s Park to those who have never\n\nbefore had an effective voice in the corridors of power," Rae pledged in the\n\nspeech, met with courteous attention from the house\'s 130 members. \n\n  The government also plans to introduce an environmental bill\n\nof rights giving people the power to sue polluters and a safe drinking water\n\nact, he said. \n\n  The NDP will keep its commitment to legislating a common\n\npause day once the Ontario Court of Appeal has delivered its ruling on Sunday\n\nshopping. \n\n  As expected, Rae said he will scrap the Liberal government\'s\n\nno-fault auto insurance system this spring. \n\n  But he gave few details of the new plan, which Financial\n\nInstitutions Minister Peter Kormos said would include a role for insurance\n\nbrokers and could be delivered in conjunction with an existing\n\ncorporation. \n\n  The halt to planning further nuclear stations - plants Hydro\n\nsaid it needs to meet growing demands for electricity - means the giant\n\nutility will reallocate &dollar;240 million to conservation, Rae said.\n\n\n\n  Measures for workers will include legislation requiring more\n\nnotice of plant closures and a previously announced fund to help pay\n\nvacation and severance benefits for employees of bankrupt companies.\n\n\n\n  The government will also gradually raise the minimum wage,\n\ncurrently at &dollar;5.40 an hour, to within 60 per cent of the average\n\nindustrial wage. \n\n \n\nmore-specific &dollar;2-billion Agenda for the People, a list of policy\n\nplatforms released during the summer election campaign that brought the NDP\n\nunexpectedly to power. \n\n  But the throne speech failed to set the new government apart,\n\nLiberal Opposition Leader Bob Nixon charged during a news conference.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '9a66b67a-135b-4223-8ae6-c281db72ba11', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.870538+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9775663614273071, 'non_english_score': 0.02243363857269287}
{'text': 'by Kate Kung\n\n  Every year the World Film Festival whizzes into town for a twelve\n\nday cinephile-a-thon.\n Having been absorbed into the WFFs grand event, the Canadian Student\n\nFilm Festival has enjoyed a higher visibility and status. \n\n \n\nreceived   every year at festival central in the belly of the Hall\n\nbuilding.\n The quality of the films is often reflected in the reactions from the\n\naudience which too often include groans and polite applause. \n\n  It is a shame though when this is heard during the screening of\n\nthe winning films. \n\n \n\nUniversité de Montréal  and Concordia - being\n\ncompletely shut-out of the winner\'s circle.\n Aside from Concordia\'s Oliver Slupecki\'s " Tidings of Joy" which\n\nreceived an honourable mention in the fiction film category, all the winners\n\nheralded from Vancouver and Toronto. \n\n  There was a buzz among francophone student filmmakers about the\n\nconsistant lack of  quebecois  judges and its correlation with\n\nthe absence of francophone winners.\n "\n\n fleur-de-lys  maniac"  , a student expressed her\n\nfrustration that the Canadian student film fest did not reflect a Canada\n\nwhich included Quebec. \n\n  It is rather questionable if the festival reflected Canadian\n\nfilmmaking at all. \n\n  Granted we\'re not as extreme as our neighbours down south, but\n\nour great Canadian multi-cultural pot stews just as vigorously.\n Despite a vigorous political and social environment, the majority of\n\nthe films dealt with very few issues which had any resemblance to anything\n\ndistinctly Canadian. \n\n  The Norman McLaren prize, a &dollar;1000 bonanza offered by the\n\nNational Film Board, went to Simon Fraser University\'s Trent Carlson and\n\nRobert Aschman for " Round the Corner". \n\n  Jane Milroy from Simon Fraser in B.C. walked away with the best\n\nexperimental film award for " Geometria".\n U.B.C. student Frederik Thorsen tied for the fiction award with "\n\nWake Linda" - a film about paternal domination and punishment based on a true\n\nstory.\n Fellow U.B.C. student Joshua Gross shared the prize with " Learning\n\nto Dance", a tiresome chase film with a dance sequence. \n\n  The best documentary prize went to York University\'s Earl Kisluk\n\nfor " Wayne McLean: Mouthpiecous Extraordinarous"  , a film about a\n\nradio show host who makes Terry DiMonte seem tight-lipped and humble.\n Kisluk also received a special mention for his film " The Last Draw".\n\n\n\n  Bad news for animation fans.\n Only one animated film was entered this year.\n The judges, feeling that it was not strong enough an entry to warrant\n\nan award, phased out the category for this year.  \n\n\n\n\n\n  This years edition of the men\'s rugby football club should prove\n\nto be  <-> it\'s   responsibilities   to the club through his\n\nposition as interim president, and at the same time he\'s willing to give up\n\nhis role as the team\'s captain. \n\n  Rugby at Concordia has long been regarded as a second rate\n\npriority by the planners and staff in the university\'s athletic department.\n\n\n\n  In the past, high profile sports like football and basketball\n\nhave benefited from the affection and attention bestowed upon them by the\n\nathletic department.\n\n\n difficult   for less-regarded teams like the men\'s rugby team to\n\naspire to a higher level of success. \n\n  Unlike the majority of varsity teams at Con U, the rugby team\n\ncounts on its members to ensure that the sport grows and thrives at the\n\nschool. \n\n  " The rugby team tends to rely on itself," says Owen Falquero, a\n\nthree year veteran.\n " Not because we really want to, or enjoy it, but because if you want\n\nto play, you have to organize the games and make sure everything is in\n\norder." \n\n  Concordia\'s rugby program finds itself at a crossroad.\n It has corralled a top flight coach and at least one player is likely\n\nto play for Canada within the next year.\n\n\nits   second-class status then more players like Andrew Duffield must\n\nstep forward and hope that their enthusiasm for the game rubs off on the\n\nmovers and shakers of the athletics department.  \n\n\n " Scruffy-looking people are automatically\n\ntreated like shit"    \n\n\n\n  Faubourg security guards roughed up a Concordia student when he\n\ndemanded to know why his friend was being detained. \n\n  The incident took place Aug. 10 at the Faubourg Ste. Catherine,\n\nwhere students often go to eat.\n Kenneth Huck, 26, and two friends had eaten lunch and were shopping\n\nindividually when Huck noticed one friend, Nick Vasil, flanked by four\n\nsecurity guards. \n\n  Huck walked over to find out what was happening, and demanded to\n\nknow if Vasil was under arrest and for what reason. \n\n  According to Huck, a stout, bearded, fair-haired guard refused to\n\nanswer, and instead used his belly to push Huck.\n Huck was then told that Vasil had been stopped for allegedly\n\nshoplifting a bottle of juice, but the charge was dropped. \n\n  " Huck didn\'t commit any crime," said witness Jonathan Carrigan,\n\na Plantation fruit store employee.\n\n\n  Twenty-year-old Carrigan described the security guards as\n\nbeing  " extra rough"  and using  " excessive force"\n\n on Huck. \n\n  " At one point, the guards pushed, tripped him down and dragged\n\nhim by the cuff of his shirt ( with) Huck\'s head hitting against a wall, con\n\n<l> crete pillar, and some mailboxes," said Carrigan. \n\n  Huck said he was also handcuffed roughly, kicked and struck in\n\nthe face while he was handcuffed on the floor. \n\n  Huck added that he lost feeling in parts of his thumb after a\n\ntall, dark-haired guard with a buzz-cut named Dominic twisted Huck\'s wrist.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Nino Bruni, project manager for Reemark-Faubourg ( the private\n\ncompany that owns the Faubourg) said he could not comment until he meets with\n\nHuck. \n\n  Huck said he will press charges against the company unless it\n\nagrees to have its guards trained properly.\n He said none identified themselves by name, position or as a security\n\nguard.\n Huck also said the guards never told him he was under arrest, or gave\n\nany reasons for detaining or handcuffing him. \n\n  Huck himself was a security guard for Canadian Security Agency\n\nfor 18 months. \n\n  " I really don\'t want to sue them," said Huck.\n " But I want to see changes.\n I will agree not to sue them if Reemark undertakes to train all\n\nguards." \n\n  names, but\n\none was stout, bearded and fair-haired; the second was a tall, dark-haired\n\nthin man with a buzz-cut; the third was a tall, young, blond man; and the man\n\nin red was short and slightly balding. \n\n  A search at Montreal\'s courthouse did not reveal other\n\nlawsuits against the company, but Carrigan said that guards often kick people\n\nout ( especially if they\'re unkempt) even if they\'re not doing anything\n\nwrong. \n\n  " But little old women who don\'t look suspicious get away with\n\nstealing ( fruit) all the time," said Carrigan, who\'s worked at\n\nPlantation for three years. \n\n  " Scruffy-looking people are automatically treated like shit\n\n( by the guards.)\n\n\n  Both Huck and Angelos Drosopoulos ( the other friend) were\n\ncharged by MUC police with assault.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Concordia students voted last year to give CUSACORP 25 cents per\n\ncredit on top of the &dollar; 1.60 CUSA fee they already pay - but no one\'s\n\ncollecting it. \n\n  The cancellation of the fee is due to controversy surrounding\n\nlast semester\'s CUSACORP referendum: a referendum CUSA co-president\n\nCharlene Nero called  " a lot of bunk."  \n\n \n\nelection to decide whether to add the 25 cent fee.\n The money would have raised an extra &dollar;80,000 for CUSACORP,\n\nallowing it to be financially autonomous from CUSA \n\n  The legality of last semester\'s referendum is in question for two\n\nmajor reasons.\n The first is that all Concordia students were allowed to vote for a\n\nfee which would be paid only by Arts    and   Science\n\nand Fine Arts students. \n\n  Commerce and Administration and Engineering and Computer Science\n\nstudents pay a fee to their own student associations ( CASA and ECA\n\nrespectively), and none to CUSA. \n\n  Secondly, it is unclear whether it was legal for Shawn O\'Hara,\n\nwho worked as a programmer for CUSACORP last semester, to work on the\n\ncampaign.\n He headed up the " " Yes" " campaign in the\n\nreferendum.\n According to CUSA judicial board guidelines, it is illegal to pay any\n\n<l> one to campaign. \n\n \n\n  Co-presidents Nero and Eleanor Brown will be appointing a\n\njudicial board of students to discuss the legitimacy of the campaign and to\n\ndecide if the judicial board guideline applies to O\'Hara. \n\n  CUSACORP, formed in 1984 by members of CUSA, was intended to be a\n\nstudent-run, profit-making organization.\n The corporation operates Mugshots Café, Reggie\'s Pub, The\n\nDive, Used Bookstores, Games Rooms and the Loyola Campus Centre. \n\n  CUSACORP receives its annual budget from CUSA and uses it to\n\noperate and maintain these facilities.\n Renovations to Reggie\'s, Mugshots and the Dive in the Loyola Campus\n\nCentre are just a few of the plans CUSACORP president Darren Porter has\n\nin store for this year. \n\n  CUSACORP has been plagued by financial problems since its\n\ninception and has failed to turn a profit during its seven years in ex <l>\n\nistence. \n\n  Last year, the corporation had a deficit of &dollar;50,000.\n " isn\'t that much in\n\na historical context since CUSACORP has lost a lot more in former\n\nyears."  \n\n  CUSA, which is funded by student money, has to pay for\n\nCUSACORP\'s overdrafts. \n\n  many of CUSACORP\'S\n\nproblems as being managerial.\n She and Brown plan a complete restructuring of CUSACORP\'s management\n\nthis year.\n " worst case scenario\n\nfor this year is a loss of &dollar;8,000."   \n\n\n\n\n\n  OTTAWA ( CUP) - A new Carleton University childcare\n\nfacility originally scheduled to open this month is on hold because the On\n\n<l> tario government has not come through with funding. \n\n  Although the Liberal government promised to fund the project\n\nlast year, Carleton is waiting for word from the NDP, said Heather Ti <l>\n\nerney, a university childcare supervisor.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5c259b57-3287-41f9-81eb-5fa52104e912', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.871818+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9789512753486633, 'non_english_score': 0.02104872465133667}
{'text': 'OTTAWA - A visit to the West Coast by Quebec Premier Robert\n\nBourassa would go a long way toward improving British \n\nunderstanding of Quebec, Premier Bill Vander Zalm said Tuesday. \n\n  Vander Zalm, who in January blamed anti-Meech Lake sentiment in\n\nthe West on Quebec\'s French-only sign law, said he has invited Bourassa to\n\nB.C. to explain Quebec\'s concerns and goals. \n\n  No positive response was given, but Vander Zalm said there is\n\n " a good chance he will come to visit."  \n\n  " Yeah, I told Bourassa he should come to B.C. and talk to the\n\npeople," Vander Zalm said in an interview. \n\n  In Burnaby, Vincent Pigeon, vice-president of the Chambre de\n\nCommerce Franco-Colombienne de Vancouver, said a visit by the Quebec premier\n\nmay be helpful. \n\n  " If he were to come here and were given a forum to explain how\n\nthe anglophone minority in Quebec is treated - sign law or no sign law - and\n\nexplain why it is that Quebecers believe they need protection for their\n\nlanguage and culture, it could be helpful," said Pigeon. \n\n  The Burnaby lawyer noted that Bourassa has come to B.C. before -\n\nthe most recent visit was in April, 1988.\n But he added that Vander Zalm\'s invitation appears to be a goodwill\n\ngesture, and " if that\'s what\'s required to get British Columbia on side,\n\nfine." \n\n  Association des\n\nParents du Programme Cadre  ( an association of parents with children\n\nin French language programs), said if Bourassa were to visit, he should start\n\nby talking to the provincial cabinet and Social Credit caucus. \n\n  She said now is not the time to have the Quebec premier talking\n\nto British Columbians.\n\n\n  However, she added: " I have been very pleased over the past few\n\nweeks by the way British Columbians have talked about Quebec in interviews on\n\nthe street and with letters to the editor.\n I see that they have an open mind and see the country as a whole."\n\n\n\n  La Federation des\n\nFranco-Colombiens  , called Vander Zalm\'s offer a generous one. \n\n  " I hope the Quebec government accepts and I hope the visit is\n\nafter the ratification of the Meech Lake accord and Mr. Bourassa comes as a\n\nfellow premier," she said.\n " I think it would serve a useful purpose because Mr. Bourassa has\n\noften said that Quebec is not understood in the rest of Canada." \n\n  A senior B.C. official said Tuesday Quebec is far more of a\n\nnatural ally of B.C.\'s than Newfoundland. \n\n  Ironically, anti-Meech Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells is a hero\n\nto those in B.C. who resent the Meech accord. \n\n  But Newfoundland wants a strong central government to help poorer\n\nregions, while the Quebec Liberal government\'s goal of increasing provincial\n\npowers is more consistent with B.C.\'s objectives, the official said. \n\n  Finance Minister Mel Couvelier suggested as much in a recent\n\ninterview when he said he wants B.C. to be modelled after  " Quebec\n\nInc."  \n\n  Vander Zalm hinted at the natural B.C.-Quebec alliance in his\n\ncomments Tuesday. \n\n  " I think it ( a visit) would help cement relations between the\n\npeoples ( of Quebec and B.C.)." \n\n  " It would also give a clearer understanding of what it is Quebec\n\nwants, why it is they want it, and how it fits into the over-all makeup of\n\nthe country." \n\n  Vander Zalm said he\'s convinced Bourassa is a federalist who\n\n " feels very strongly about the country."  \n\n  Meanwhile, Vander Zalm said a key factor in the progress made\n\nTuesday in the marathon Meech talks was renewed trust among the premiers that\n\nmay have been established at a private dinner he initiated Monday. \n\n  Vander Zalm, who said in January that Meech Lake was unacceptable\n\nto British Columbians, said an agreement this week would satisfy their\n\nconcerns about the accord. \n\n  He praised Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and Bourassa, and said a\n\nvisit by Bourassa to B.C. could improve British \n\nunderstanding of Quebec and its desires. \n\n  " I told Bourassa he should come to B.C. and talk to the people.\n I think he has a lot to offer by way of explaining his views on\n\nCanada." \n\n  " He feels very strongly about the country.\n\n\n  "\n\ngood chance"  Bourassa would pay a visit.  \n\n\n Vander Zalm predicts deal: PM tempers optimism, warns obstacles\n\nremain \n\n  OTTAWA - The first ministers went into another day of private\n\nconstitutional talks today, optimistic they were making headway in a bid to\n\nsolve the Meech Lake constitutional crisis. \n\n  A deal to resolve the crisis could be struck today or Thursday,\n\nB.C. Premier Bill Vander Zalm predicted after Tuesday\'s day-long session.\n\n\n\n  Vander Zalm\'s optimism was tempered by a warning from Prime\n\nMinister Brian Mulroney, who said major roadblocks to Meech\'s ratification\n\nbefore the June 23 deadline still exist. \n\n  " We had a good day, we worked hard and we made some progress,\n\nbut we\'re not there, not by a long shot," Mulroney told reporters late\n\nTuesday. \n\n  New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna was similarly cautious today,\n\nsaying: " I have a feeling that today is going to be tougher sledding and\n\nit\'s going to be much harder to make progress than we think." \n\n  But Vander Zalm, in an interview in his hotel moments after\n\nemerging from more than 12 hours of intense talks Tuesday, said he is\n\nconfident a deal can be reached this week. \n\n  " Today ( Tuesday) compared to yesterday, while I never had too\n\nmuch doubt that we would probably stick it out until something was done,\n\ntoday I could see it coming together, so it makes you feel a lot better."\n\n\n\n  He predicted the meeting could wind up late tonight or by mid-day\n\nThursday. \n\n \n\n  " I think there\'s a chance of doing it today," he said as he went\n\nin to today\'s session. \n\n  Holdout premiers Gary Filmon of Manitoba and Clyde Wells of\n\nNewfoundland said they were closer to ratifying the accord, and Quebec\n\nPremier Robert Bourassa refused to confirm any breakthrough on Senate reform,\n\nbut also did not deny it. \n\n  On the financial markets, the optimism boosted the value of the\n\ndollar, which opened today at 85.24 cents US and quickly climbed to 85.41\n\ncents, up from 85.01 at Tuesday\'s close. \n\n  The reason for the optimism: A new proposal on the Senate\n\namending formula. \n\n  The plan calls for a federal-provincial commission on Senate\n\nreform that would hold cross-country public hearings on an elected, more\n\neffective upper chamber, with power distributed more evenly among the\n\nprovinces. \n\n  If after three years the first ministers cannot agree on the\n\ncommission\'s recommendations, the four western provinces and Newfoundland\n\nwould automatically gain four more appointed senators.\n That would raise their total to 10 each, the same number as Nova\n\nScotia and New Brunswick currently have. \n\n  Prince Edward Island, which now has four senators, would get one\n\nmore while Ontario and Quebec would retain their 24 members in the upper\n\nchamber. \n\n  The senate currently has 104 seats and members are appointed by\n\nthe prime minister.\n B.C.\'s senators are Liberals Jack Austin, Len Marchand, Ray Perrault\n\nand George Van Roggen.\n\n\n  The senate proposal, which is conditional on the resolution of\n\nother items blocking passage of Meech Lake, was devised by former Liberal\n\ncabinet minister Jack Pickersgill, 84, a leading figure in bringing\n\nNewfoundland into Confederation in 1949. \n\n  Pickersgill\'s plan was tabled by Liberal P.E.I. Premier Joe Ghiz\n\nas one of a number of proposals aimed at breaking the deadlock over the\n\naccord before the June 23 deadline. \n\n  The 1987 Meech Lake constitutional amendment is opposed by\n\nLiberally governed Newfoundland, and Manitoba - where the Liberals are the\n\nopposition to a minority Conservative government - because they say it makes\n\nSenate reform virtually impossible by granting each province a veto. \n\n  They also say it does not recognize multicultural and aboriginal\n\npeople as fundamental characteristics of Canada and contains a distinct\n\nsociety clause which may allow Quebec to override the Charter of Rights and\n\nFreedoms. \n\n  New Brunswick has also not ratified the accord, but McKenna, also\n\na Liberal, said Monday he is close to approving it. \n\n  Filmon said no final conclusions were reached Tuesday, but added,\n\n" we are making progress on all areas of the agenda and I\'m really pleased\n\nwith the progress we\'re making." \n\n  Wells agreed progress was made, but cautioned that " we\'re not\n\nthere yet.\n I\'d have to characterize it as we\'ve made significant progress, but\n\nNewfoundland\'s requirements are not yet met." \n\n  Some of the other premiers were more confident that the apparent\n\nbreakthrough over the Senate will lead to a solution. \n\n  " We\'re going to have a reformed Senate and it\'s going to be a\n\nvery effective one," said Alberta Premier Don Getty, the leading proponent of\n\na Triple-E Senate - elected and effective with equal representation among the\n\nprovinces. \n\n  " I feel so much better.\n Meech Lake has had a faint heartbeat.\n Well that heart is beating away now and I love this battered\n\ncountry." \n\n  Saskatchewan Premier Grant Devine was equally elated, saying the\n\nconference had found  " the magic"  he believes is necessary\n\nto break the impasse. \n\n  " Common sense prevailed ( Tuesday)," he said.\n " The first ministers rolled up their sleeves, they were serious and\n\ntheir eyes were on the ball."  \n\n\n\n\n  VICTORIA - Auditor-general George Morfitt will heed the request\n\nof the legislature\'s public accounts committee and release details next week\n\nof lottery grants that violated funding guidelines. \n\n  Morfitt will reveal the names of funding recipients cited in his\n\nrecent annual report as examples of grants that broke guidelines under the\n\nprovincial secretary\'s lottery funds program.\n\n\n  " It\'s not a witch-hunt for names," committee chairman Darlene\n\nMarzari ( NDP-Vancouver-Point Grey) said Tuesday. \n\n  " The committee is looking at accountability and the committee\n\nhas been told that previous practices in the office have not been\n\naccountable," she said after a committee meeting. \n\n  " What we have got is a licence to abuse and it\'s the committee\'s\n\njob to end that by looking at what happened ...\n\n\n  One section of Morfitt\'s report on the government\'s 1988-89\n\nfiscal year criticized the handling of the provincial secretary\'s\n\n&dollar;32.4-million lottery funds budget and suggested new, clear guidelines\n\nare needed. \n\n  Morfitt, who was called to address the committee, said his office\n\ntends not to name such specifics. \n\n  The report said guidelines for assessing eligibility are not\n\napplied consistently. \n\n  The report noted that excluded organizations had received funds,\n\nsome grants had been allowed for operating costs, retroactive funding or\n\nother items specifically excluded by the guidelines. \n\n  One file studied by Morfitt\'s office showed the amount\n\nrecommended by the project officer was increased by the minister responsible\n\nwithout documented explanation.\n As well, the grant was for an item excluded by the guidelines and\n\npart of it  " effectively funded"  retroactive expenditures.\n\n\n\n  John Mochrie, assistant deputy minister for the provincial\n\nsecretary, told the committee his office has implemented changes to comply\n\nwith some of Morfitt\'s recommendations. \n\n  But he defended a number of the grants and said in an interview\n\nthe guidelines are being changed to  " emphasize the positive, rather\n\nthan the negative."  \n\n  Instead of stating which grant requests are not eligible, he\n\nsaid, the guidelines will stress what can be considered. \n\n  In his report to the committee, Mochrie said his office has also\n\ndrawn up new application forms for captial grants that will provide better\n\ninformation for assessing eligibility. \n\n  He said the changes should be enough to satisfy the\n\nauditor-general.  \n\n\n\n\n  VICTORIA - The ministry of health is reviewing its hospital\n\npurchasing policy in the wake of adverse publicity about government suppliers\n\nproviding free travel and accommodation to public servants and politicians,\n\nHealth Minister John Jensen said Tuesday. \n\n  The decision follows legislature debate over health equipment\n\nsupplier Siemens Electric paying all expenses for Social Credit candidate and\n\nOak Bay Mayor Susan Brice\'s 1986 trip to West Germany. \n\n  Brice, a Greater Victoria hospital board member at the time, made\n\nthe trip with four other board members, whose expenses were also covered by\n\nSiemens Electric.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '7f98db73-e268-4628-85a3-a98a8fa84493', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.872819+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9768446683883667, 'non_english_score': 0.0231553316116333}
{'text': 'Action-Prevention Valcartier held its first meeting on March 18\n\nand attracted over 70 citizens, as well as the mayor of Valcartier and some\n\nof its councillors, including Ludwig Fitzpatrick, council liaison with the\n\ncrime prevention group. \n\n  Two representatives from Astronicor, an alarm company, also\n\nattended to talk about their products. \n\n  Co-ordinator Tim Brown says that since the meeting, the mail box\n\nset up to receive anonymous tips on crimes committed has already received\n\nimportant information. \n\n \n\nBoulevard; its telephone number is  555-5050. \n\n  Brown reminds Valcartier residents that if they have a break-in or\n\nare otherwise the victims of crime, they should first phone the\n\nS&ucircumflex;reté, then notify the Action-Prevention office. \n\n  Three police officers who live in Valcartier are also working with\n\nthe committee.  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Quebec\'s Health and Social Services Minister, Marc-Yvan\n\nC&ocircumflex;té, presented a four-point plan before the Permanent\n\nCommission on Social Affairs last Tuesday, outlining where cultural\n\ncommunities - including anglophones - will fit in his sweeping health reform\n\nknown as Bill 120. \n\n  The awaited amendments addressing minority community concerns\n\nwere not tabled before the commission.\n " reflect the\n\nclose consultation the minister and his staff have had with cultural\n\ncommunities and anglophone groups over the past several months," \n\nsaid Liberal MNA Russ Williams, parliamentary assistant to the health\n\nminister. \n\n  The four principles are:- to ensure that English-speaking\n\npeople, wherever they are in the province, have access to health and social\n\nservices.- to ensure the integrity of the province\'s network of\n\nEnglish-language institutions.- to ensure anglophone representation on\n\nregional and institutional boards.- to put in place budget allocation\n\n<l> - to put in place budget allocation mechanisms to achieve these points.\n\n\n\n  " I hope there will be no opposition to these points ( in the\n\nNational Assembly).\n It is not a political issue.\n\n\n  Williams recalled that Bill 142, the 1986 law ensuring health and\n\nsocial services to Quebec\'s anglophones, had to be brought in with closure\n\nbecause there was so much opposition to it. \n\n  Sara Saber, who heads a team studying the reform at Alliance\n\nQuebec in Montreal, while encouraged by the direction the health minister is\n\ntaking, expressed concern over anglophone representation on the powerful new\n\nregional boards created under the reform by unifying institutions under\n\nsingle boards. \n\n  Harry Hannon, director general of St. Brigid\'s Home, said his\n\ninstitution has already been recognized by the local regional council as\n\nhaving an independent role to play in the region\'s health care system.\n\n\n  Saber said that any independent board status for anglophone\n\ninstitutions " should be clearly written into the law as a guarantee." \n\n  Saber also wants a specific mechanism written into the law " to\n\ncompensate for any lack of ( minority group) representation on regional\n\nboards," she said. \n\n  That mechanism can be in the form of a co-opting system, whereby\n\nthe 20-member boards, once formed, must add an unspecified number of\n\nanglophone or cultural community members to their ranks. \n\n  Another mechanism would involve direct ministerial nomination of\n\nminority group members to boards.\n In either case, there must be governmental accountability, said\n\nSaber. \n\n  " Our experience is that when there is no government\n\naccountability nothing happens," she said.  \n\n\n\n\n  Most Rev.

Gould, as is his wont, explored the social biases which\n\naffect the putatively objective scientific view of the world.\n In this instance, he chose representations of evolution as\n\nthey appear in high and low art and to call attention to built-in pre <l>\n\njudices.\n His examples included advertisements, cartoons, illustrations\n\nand paintings ancient and modern.\n He showed several samples of the typical ladder of life drawing\n\nstarting with a chimpanzee ( not a direct ancestor of humans) and moving\n\nthrough  homo habilis  and  homo erectus  to  homo\n\nsapiens  who is  " always a

Ontario and Manitoba have agreed to negotiate a\n\nlong-term agreement that will protect Winnipeg\'s drinking water supply from\n\nfuture economic development, Premier Gary Filmon said yesterday. \n\n  If officials can conclude the work started yesterday during a\n\n75-minute " courtesy call" on Ontario Premier Bob Rae, Filmon said,\n\nWinnipeggers might never have to worry about commercial developments\n\nendangering the quality of water from Shoal Lake in northwestern Ontario.\n\n\n\n  For more than two years, Filmon tried to negotiate a deal with\n\nthe Ontario Liberal government to ensure a Toronto firm is prevented from\n\ndeveloping a gold mine operation on the lake. \n\n  He got that assurance and more yesterday in his first meeting\n\nwith the newly elected NDP premier. \n\n  " We may embark on some additional matters to do with long-term\n\nassurance of protection so that we not only deal with the current project of\n\nthe mining but that we look at the longer term of having an overall\n\nmanagement agreement of the water supply," Filmon said. \n\n  " Mr. Rae has assured us of his full co-operation and commitment\n\nto utilize their environmental act to protect Winnipeg\'s water supply." \n\n  An official in Rae\'s office confirmed the two leaders would like\n\nan agreement that would protect the environment. \n\n  " Premier Rae gave his personal commitment that when faced with\n\nthe issue of a gold mine or drinking water, people came first," the official\n\nsaid on the condition he not    be   identified.\n\n\n\n  " a very\n\noptimistic, positive first meeting."  \n\n  The premiers reaffirmed a &dollar;13-billion, multi-year\n\nagreement that would have Manitoba supply large quantities of hydroelectric\n\npower to Ontario.  \n\n\n Courtroom soap opera leaves \'ghoulish\' fans with appetite\n\nfor more \n\n\n  The Brian Jack trial was real life soap opera that spectators say\n\nthey couldn\'t get enough of and sheepishly admit they\'re sorry is over. \n\n  " It\'s almost like having an old friend.\n You get used to building your day around it," said one 62-year-old\n\nwoman, who asked not be named. \n\n  " I know it must seem ghoulish when you consider that a man\'s\n\nfuture is at stake, but you just get so caught up in what\'s going to happen\n\nnext," said the woman, a regular at the 10-week trial. \n\n  She was just one of the countless spectators who jammed into the\n\n66-seat courtroom at Winnipeg\'s Law Courts Building since the trial started\n\nSept. 10, especially in the last few days when the final arguments of Crown\n\nattorney Jack Montgomery and defence    lawyer \n\n Richard Wolson held them spellbound. \n\n  On some days, spectators started lining up as early as 8:30 a.m.,\n\nwhen the Law Courts Building opens.\n\n\n  " I waited and waited for someone to come out, but no one\n\ndid for a long time,"  said another woman who also didn\'t want to be\n\nidentified.\n " I guess once people got in, they stuck to their seats like glue."\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  The brother of a local Metis leader was shot in the head by a\n\nWinnipeg police officer early yesterday after he pointed a toy handgun at two\n\nofficers, police said. \n\n\n  Dan Wilson Delaronde, 42, was in the Health Sciences Centre\n\nintensive care unit in critical condition last night recovering from a single\n\nbullet wound to his head. \n\n  Delaronde is the brother of Billyjo Delaronde, executive director\n\nof the Manitoba Metis Federation. \n\n  Deputy chief Paul Johnston told a news conference yesterday\n\nmorning Delaronde was shot by a police constable at about 12:30 a.m. after he\n\npointed what the officer believed to    be   a\n\nhandgun at him and his partner. \n\n  The gun turned out to be a large, black plastic imitation, but\n\nJohnston said it appeared to be authentic and the officer - a 10-year veteran\n\n- fired his service revolver in what he believed was self-defence. \n\n  The shooting climaxed a bizarre chain of events which began\n\nshortly after midnight when a man called a Manitoba Telephone System operator\n\nfrom a phone in the New West Hotel, 786 Main Street. \n\n  Johnston said the man, who police believe was Delaronde, was\n\n " threatening violence"  and the operator referred the\n\ninformation along with the origin of the call to a 911 operator in the\n\ndepartment\'s communication centre. \n\n  Johnston refused to elaborate on the specific nature of the\n\nthreats or to say how police later determined the caller was Delaronde. \n\n  He said officers from the department\'s crime division are\n\ninvestigating the shooting and a report will be submitted next week for\n\nconsideration by a panel of senior officers.  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Driving past the abandoned and moss-covered Canada Packers plant\n\non Marion Street, former workers talk about broken marriages, suicide and\n\npoverty. \n\n  But the reality for many who once sliced bacon and beef on the\n\nkilling floor is less traumatic - they survived the slaughter by taking\n\nlower-paying jobs, attending classes, and finding new careers. \n\n  More than 900 workers had lost their jobs by the time Canada\n\nPackers Ltd. shut its doors on March 25, 1988, the largest plant shutdown in\n\nManitoba history. \n\n  " The first year was really the pits," said Carole Johnston, 56,\n\nwho spent 37 years at the plant.\n " It was the unknown.\n What will you do?\n\n\n\n  Johnston, who lied about her age at 15 to land her first job at\n\nCanada Packers, said she now lives  " comfortably"  on an\n\nolder worker\'s pension in a basement apartment in St. Boniface. \n\n  " What the hell can you do when you\'re 56?\n\n\n  She still suffers from an arm injury - one of her gloves became\n\nstuck in a reduction machine at the plant - and through force of habit wakes\n\nup at 5 a.m., as she did for her shifts at Canada Packers. \n\n  " It was one of the better things to happen to me," said Greg\n\nZembik, a 35-year-old former packer who managed to find a sales job after\n\ntaking a business course. \n\n  " I wouldn\'t want to have spent the rest of my life there.\n When you\'re young, the money is so good you don\'t want to leave.\n\n\n  " To a lot of people, there was no life after Canada Packers."\n\n\n\n  The money was good at Canada Packers, anywhere from &dollar;8 to\n\n&dollar;16 an hour. \n\n  In interviews, former workers said some of their colleagues,\n\nespecially older people with little education, had gone broke, seen their\n\nfamilies fall apart or suffered nervous breakdowns. \n\n  They also knew of former workers who had taken their own lives.\n\n\n\n  But all those interviewed said they themselves were living\n\ncomfortably, but modestly.   \n\n\n\n\n Winnipeg Free Press\n\n  PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE - Two federal cabinet ministers kicked the\n\ndoor open yesterday to the possibility the military base may not leave this\n\ncommunity in 1992. \n\n  Both Energy Minister Jake Epp and Western Diversification\n\nMinister Charlie Mayer said the federal cabinet has yet to decide whether to\n\nname Portage as the only site for military flight training in coming tender\n\ndocuments. \n\n  " It was important for us to have these points made directly to\n\nus again as we move into the decision-making period on Southport ( base),"\n\nEpp said after a breakfast meeting with community leaders. \n\n  " I think we\'ve simply had some more updates on that information\n\nand have strengthened the resolve of the Manitoba ( federal Conservative)\n\ncaucus." \n\n  At the meeting, Chamber of Commerce president Brian Pallister\n\nmade an impassioned plea to the ministers to fight to keep military flight\n\ntraining in Portage. \n\n  " I would like you to take away the uncertainty, I would like you\n\nto take away the fear," he said. \n\n  " I am proud, but I\'m not too proud to beg you to make Portage\n\nsite-specific." \n\n  Ottawa plans to privatize basic flight training in 1992 as a\n\ncost-cutting measure.\n Several companies have expressed interest in bidding on the contract,\n\nbut the operation could leave the Portage airbase. \n\n  Conservative MP Felix Holtmann ( Portage-Interlake) said the\n\ninterest aerospace companies have shown in the Portage facility proves it\'s\n\nthe best place for military flight training. \n\n  " I think we\'re past the phase of base closure and looking toward\n\na transition and looking at it being a positive answer," Holtmann said. \n\n  " If you do your homework in Portage and have a very much of a\n\nunited effort, then it\'s up to those of us in government to deliver on your\n\nbehalf," Mayer said.  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Despite modifications made to the &dollar;57 million bypass\n\naround Kenora, which opened yesterday, businesses in the town will suffer\n\nlosses, says the president of the Chamber of Commerce. \n\n  Wayne Marcino said they might even exceed dire predictions in a\n\n1989 study that &dollar;10 million in revenues will be lost annually. \n\n  " It might even he higher than that.\n Maybe it\'s going to be &dollar;20 million or &dollar;40 million," he\n\nsaid. \n\n \n\n  Business people and the municipality successfully lobbied the\n\nOntario government for &dollar;5.5 million worth of changes in the original\n\nconstruction plans, said Kenora    Counsillor  \n\nMark Duggan.\n\n\n  " The tri-municipal areas are as prepared as they could be for\n\nit," said Duggan, who is also executive director of the Sunset Country Travel\n\nAssociation. \n\n  The design changes at the intersection of the old Trans-Canada\n\nHighway and the bypass makes the existing route into town the most obvious\n\nchoice for motorists, he said. \n\n  Traffic signs along the new road, which circles eight kilometres\n\nnorth of Kenora, should also funnel more cars into town, he said. \n\n  The province agreed to designate the bypass as alternate route\n\n17A, he said, and retain the main route number 17 for the highway into town.\n\n\n\n  Townsfolk originally lobbied the provincial government to build\n\nthe bypass because truck traffic was causing problems downtown. \n\n  But tourists as well as truckers will bypass the communities of\n\nKenora, Jaffray-Malick and Keewatin, said David Treusch, director of the Lake\n\nof the Woods Economic Development Corp. \n\n  " Those businesses which are heavily dependent on highway\n\ntraffic might have to change their business focus.\n For instance, instead of selling trinkets they might want to move\n\ninto more upscale items."  \n\n\n Contract supports the research on program to make computers read\n\nhandwriting \n\n  A major research contract between Corcordia and Bell\n\nQuébec, a division of Bell Canada, was signed on November 11. \n\n  Concordia computer scientist Dr Ching Y.

{'text': 'Canadian and U.S. governments have failed to protect human health\n\nbecause they haven\'t cleaned up toxins in the Great Lakes, the International\n\nJoint Commission says in a report released Tuesday. \n\n  Governments must ban dumping of any toxic chemicals into lakes and\n\nrivers to prevent serious disease and birth defects in humans, the commission\n\nsays in its most strongly-worded report ever. \n\n  " The commission must conclude that there is a threat to\n\nthe health of our children emanating from our exposure to persistent toxic\n\nsubstances."  \n\n  The Great Lakes basin is home to 40 million people.\n The commission is a Canada-U.S. body that advises the two governments\n\non managing the shared waters. \n\n  Children of mothers who regularly ate Lake Michigan fish tended to\n\nbe smaller at birth, had smaller skulls and were slow learners, the report\n\nsays. \n\n  " ample reason to strongly suspect exposure to\n\nchemicals, particularly PCBs ( polychlorinated biphenyls), was damaging to\n\nthe offspring of those mothers,"  it concludes. \n\n  It says the presence of cancer, weak immune systems, birth defects\n\nand sterility in lake fish, birds and mammals raise  " two fundamental\n\nand sobering questions: Are humans in danger?\n\n\n  The report urges more research on health hazards other than\n\ncancer, such as damage to hormones, the brain and immune systems. \n\n  The 59-page report hammers the federal government for inaction\n\nand the sluggish pace of plans intended to clean up toxic " hot spots" on the\n\nlakes and the St. Lawrence River.\n\n\n  The cleanup plans are bogged down in bureaucracy and haven\'t made\n\nreal advances in the four years since they began, the IJC says. \n\n  One stumbling block has been delays by bureaucrats who can\'t\n\nagree on what the problems are in the first place, the report says.\n " are not merely a\n\nplanning exercise."  \n\n  " accept,\n\nand encourage others to accept, their responsibility"  to the lakes.\n\n\n\n  " There is no clear indication they ( governments)\n\nconsistently and comprehensively support the intention of the ( Great Lakes\n\nWater Quality) Agreement with specific actions and adequate resources."\n\n \n\n  It says governments should start by banning all toxic discharges\n\ninto Lake Superior as a pilot project, since Superior is the cleanest lake\n\nand is at the top of the lake system. \n\n  "\n\nan exercise in contraction,"  the report says.\n It urges governments to issue stronger public warnings against eating\n\ncertain types of fish that contain toxic chemicals. \n\n  " They ( the commission) basically say the federal governments on\n\nboth sides have done nothing about anything," said Gord Perks of Greenpeace.\n " If I were ( Environment Minister) Lucien Bouchard I would be very\n\nangry." \n\n  " a challenge to Lucien Bouchard,\n\n( Ontario    Environment   Minister)\n\nJim Bradley and American legislators to clean up the lakes."  \n\n  " It\'s probably the first time I would strongly congratulate the\n\nIJC," said John Jackson, president of Great Lakes United, a coalition of 200\n\n groups around the lakes.  \n\n\n Commons passes GST; Two Tory MPs face expulsion for voting\n\nagainst unpopular tax \n\n \n\n  Two shouting protesters were ejected from the nearly empty\n\ngalleries for throwing anti-GST streamers, but the vote was subdued compared\n\nto the finance committee filibuster and other marathon sessions over the tax.\n\n\n\n  Despite public and opposition pressure on government MPs to\n\nreject the hugely unpopular measure, the bill passed 144 - 114. \n\n  Only two Tory backbenchers voted against it.\n Alex Kindy and David Kilgour, both from Alberta, were expected to be\n\nexpelled today from the national party caucus. \n\n  Neither was present at today\'s meeting.\n\n\n  A senior Alberta Tory, Arnold Malone, was expected to push for\n\nthe  expulsion. \n\n  " If you\'re wearing our sweater and you shoot the puck into our\n\nown goal, you\'ve got to question whether you should be sitting on our own\n\nbench anymore." \n\n  Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said on the way into the meeting\n\nthat he would listen to his Alberta members before making up his own mind on\n\nwhether Kindy and Kilgour should be expelled. \n\n  The GST bill now goes to the Senate where the Liberals, who hold\n\na majority in the upper chamber, have vowed to keep it for up to six months\n\nwhile cross-country hearings are held. \n\n  The seven-per-cent tax on virtually all goods and services is due\n\nto take effect Jan. 1, 1991.\n sales\n\ntax on Canadian manufactured goods. \n\n  Government House Leader Harvie Andre admitted the Senate has the\n\nlegal power to block or defeat the bill. \n\n  But if " we get to a situation where we consider it reasonable\n\nfor an unelected body ... to veto a democratically elected House of Commons,\n\nthen I think we are into a dangerous, dangerous situation." \n\n  Neither Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, whose government is at a\n\nrecord low 15 per cent in the polls, nor Finance Minister Michael Wilson was\n\npresent for the vote. \n\n  Mulroney was meeting U.S. President George Bush in Toronto and\n\nWilson was in Europe for a meeting of the leading western economies. \n\n  In all, seven Conservative cabinet ministers and 10 backbenchers\n\nwere absent for the 15-minute vote.\n But of those missing, only Quebec MP Fernand Jourdenais and Alberta\n\nMP Louise Feltham had indicated they were unhappy with the GST. \n\n \n\n  Government whip Jim Hawkes had made it clear Conservatives would\n\nneed a good excuse to be absent for what the government classed a confidence\n\nvote. \n\n  Governments traditionally resign if defeated on a vote of\n\nconfidence. \n\n  The failure of the much-rumored revolt of Tory backbenchers was\n\ndescribed as a tragedy by Kilgour. \n\n  He called MPs who followed the party line despite their\n\nmisgivings  " robots"  . \n\n  " If there is no room for dissent in the party ... it will be a\n\ntragedy for the party and for the country." \n\n  Asked about the fate of the two rebels, House Leader Andre said\n\nhe would be  " very surprised if there is any significant move in\n\ncaucus for them to stay there ...\n\n\n  Opposition MPs were dejected as they left the Commons chamber.\n\n\n\n  " The war may not totally be lost but this was a big battle,"\n\nsaid Liberal finance critic Doug Young. \n\n  " We tried everything we could possibly do, there was nothing\n\nelse," said NDP finance critic Lorne Nystrom. \n\n  " Now I encourage the Senate to do some foot dragging ... and\n\nsend back several recommended changes to the Commons next fall, and we will\n\ngive it one more kick at the can." \n\n \n\n  " I still believe that public opinion can turn this thing around ...\n\nWe\'ve got to keep up the fight." \n\n  Of the two area Conservative MPs, only Paul Dick,\n\nLanark-Carleton, voted for the legislation.\n\n\n  All 12 area Liberals voted against the bill.\n They were Mark Assad, Gatineau-La Lievre; Eugene Bellemare, Carleton\n\nGloucester; Don Boudria, Glengarry-Prescott-Russell; Marlene Catterall,\n\nOttawa West; Beryl Gaffney, Nepean; Jean-Robert Gauthier, Ottawa-Vanier; Mac\n\nHarb, Ottawa Centre;

{'text': 'The Filmon government introduced new housing legislation yesterday\n\nto give it tougher powers to fight slum landlords and reform the manner in\n\nwhich landlord-tenant disputes are settled. \n\n  The bill is a fine-tuned, but largely unchanged, version of a\n\nsimilar bill withdrawn earlier this year by the Tory minority government\n\nafter a lobby by influential businessmen, including a landlords association\n\nand the Winnipeg Real Estate Board. \n\n  The legislation, known as Bill 13, gives the province broader\n\npowers to take action against slum landlords by collecting rents from an\n\nentire building to be used to carry out repairs. \n\n  It also creates a Residential Tenancies Branch to deal with\n\nlandlord-tenant disputes and establishes a three-member commission to hear\n\nappeals. \n\n  The operation of the branch and the commission would be monitored\n\nby a new advisory committee with representation from landlords and tenants.\n\n\n\n  There were widespread fears by tenants groups and anti-poverty\n\nfighters that the bill would be gutted to favor the \n\nconcerns and rammed through the house under the new Tory majority. \n\n  While both sides of the debate were digesting the contents of the\n\n119-page bill yesterday, they said they were happy with their first\n\nimpressions. \n\n  " I don\'t think we\'ve taken out anything substantial from the\n\nbill," said Urban Affairs Minister Gerry Ducharme.\n " We think it is very progressive legislation and something that both\n\nlandlords and tenants can live with." \n\n  If there was a major change, it occurred in the provisions\n\nallowing the government to appoint a receiver to carry out repairs to a\n\nrundown apartment. \n\n  Under the previously proposed bill, tenants were allowed to\n\nrequest the appointment of a receiver-manager to act on their behalf. \n\n \n\ngiven sweeping powers to oversee repairs. \n\n  A lien was to be placed on the property giving the province, not\n\nthe mortgage holder, the first right to recover the costs. \n\n  Under the newly proposed law, a tenant still has the right to\n\nrequest a receiver-manager be appointed to carry out repairs. \n\n  However, the courts must determine if an institution holding a\n\nmortgage against the property is unwilling  " within a reasonable\n\nperiod of time"  to carry out the repairs. \n\n  Also, the cost of the repairs must take into account the\n\nestimated revenue earned from the building over a six-month period. \n\n  NDP housing critic Doug Martindale, who has previously headed the\n\nWinnipeg Housing Concerns Group, said the change was won by the landlords \n\n  through   pressure on the Tories. \n\n \n\ntenants   who wanted that changed," he said. \n\n  He also said the law should ensure security deposits paid by\n\ntenants to landlords are held in trust by the province and that condition\n\nreports at the time of occupancy be mandatory. \n\n  The new bill permits landlords to continue holding deposits in\n\ntheir own trust accounts.\n The previous bill forced landlords to report the location of those\n\naccounts to the province. \n\n  The new bill makes condition reports mandatory only if requested\n\nby a landlord or tenant. \n\n  Managers\'\n\n Association, said he has not had time to read through the new bill and\n\nsaid he could not comment until next week. \n\n  David Smith, president of the Winnipeg Real Estate Board, said he\n\nwas pleased the government allowed groups from both sides of the debate to\n\nparticipate in the consultation process. \n\n  " It looks like a good piece legislation," he said.\n " It also offers a good due process approach where is you don\'t like\n\na decision, you could have it appealed."  \n\n\n\n\n\n  years\'\n\n probation for a sexual assault that transmitted gonorrhea to an\n\neight-year-old girl. \n\n  Justice Minister Jim McCrae said yesterday he does not believe\n\nthe sentence imposed on Bruno Cristopher Hiller reflects the seriousness of\n\nhis offence. \n\n  " We\'re trying really hard to restore faith in our justice system\n\nand sometimes it\'s hard when we get sentences that are inappropriate in our\n\nestimation," he said. \n\n  " This one is and we will appeal it and that\'s the only avenue\n\nopen to us." \n\n  Hiller was originally sentenced to six years in prison in\n\nFebruary after a trial in which he refused legal counsel.\n But the Manitoba Court of Appeal ordered a new trial, ruling among\n\nother things that Hiller made mistakes defending himself that infringed on\n\nhis right to a fair trial. \n\n  Last week, in the second trial, where Hiller had a lawyer, Judge\n\nRaymond Harris reduced the sentence to probation.\n\n\n \n\nCarstairs   charged yesterday that a pattern seems to be emerging in\n\nwhich the courts treat violence against children less seriously than they\n\ntreat other forms of assault. \n\n  " Like all parents, I am once again dismayed at a sentence which\n\nclearly implies that sexual abuse of children is not considered a serious\n\noffence," she said. \n\n  Carstairs noted she raised a case last year in which a man who\n\nabused a cat was given a stiffer sentence than some offenders who abused\n\nchildren. \n\n  She said she has to question whether the courts understand how\n\nserious child sexual abuse is when a stabbing in a Main Street hotel results\n\nin a more serious sentence. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  The province is warning oil companies it will slap controls on\n\ngasoline prices unless they keep prices in line. \n\n  Toughening the government\'s stance, Consumer Affairs Minister Ed\n\nConnery said yesterday he wrote to oil companies this week to remind them\n\nthat protecting consumers from price-gouging is the province\'s main concern\n\nduring the crisis in the Persian Gulf. \n\n  Connery, who met with oil company executives about a month ago,\n\nsaid he has called them into his office for a second series of meetings next\n\nweek. \n\n  The meetings were called to outline the regulatory options the\n\ngovernment is considering, he said. \n\n  One of those options is to have gasoline prices reviewed by the\n\nprovince\'s Public Utilities Board, as the NDP Opposition has demanded. \n\n  But Connery said he is concerned that would commit the province\n\nto a long-term process of regulating prices in the industry and may not\n\nguarantee a price reduction. \n\n  He said the other option would be to set up a commission of\n\ninquiry to report to cabinet order. \n\n  The letter to oil companies comes after sabre-rattling by Premier\n\nGary Filmon last week. \n\n  Filmon said that even after higher Canadian taxes were deducted,\n\nManitobans were paying more for gas than residents in Grand Forks and Fargo\n\nwere paying for gas trucked in through Manitoba. \n\n \n\n  Winnipeg gas prices - 56.9 cents a litre before Iraq seized\n\nKuwait - soared to 66.1 cents before falling back to 64.9 cents,\n\ncoincidentally with Filmon comments. \n\n  NDP consumer affairs critic Jim Maloway ( Elmwood) said he hopes\n\nand believes the government\'s recent actions indicate it is getting set to\n\nimpose price regulation. \n\n  " I think that it\'s only a matter of time now before they will be\n\nforced into it," he said. \n\n  Connery downplayed Maloway\'s suggestion that price controls are\n\nimminent, saying the government has the option of letting the oil companies\n\ncontinue to determine pricing. \n\n  But he did say he wants to quiz company officials on recent\n\nindustry predictions that prices will head up again. \n\n  " We want them to explain to us if it has to go up, why?\n\n\n  " The consumer has to be treated fairly in the marketplace and\n\nthat is our main concern," he said.  \n\n\n\n\n  Wolseley-area schools have been warned to be on the lookout after\n\na man abducted a 10-year-old boy Thursday while he was on his way home from\n\nschool, Winnipeg police said yesterday. \n\n  Police spokesman Eric Turner said the youth, who was not\n\nassaulted in the incident, was walking home near Clifton Street and Wolseley\n\nAvenue when he was called over by a man who then pulled him into a waiting\n\ncar. \n\n  Turner said the youth was in the car for almost two hours, being\n\ndriven around the city\'s west end. \n\n  The boy was eventually able to break free from the man and ran to\n\na gas bar. \n\n  The man is described as 28 to 32 years old, with an average\n\nbuild, unshaven with a brown moustache and shoulder-length, straight brown\n\nhair. \n\n  He was wearing a long grey jacket, black pants, black and white\n\nChip and Pepper shirt and white Nike runners with pink lettering. \n\n  The car is described as an older model dark green station wagon.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n  Vandals tipped over 31 tombstones at St. John\'s Cathedral in\n\nWinnipeg\'s north end, but caused little damage. \n\n  Police say the disturbed headstones were discovered by the\n\ncemetery manager when he arrived for work early yesterday morning. \n\n  A church spokesman said the gravestones were uprighted\n\nimmediately with no damage to the graves, some more than 80 years old  .\n\n  The disturbed tombstones are located in the southeast end of the\n\ncemetery, near the intersection of Anderson Avenue and St. John\'s Avenue.\n\n\n\n  The church spokesman, who did not want to be identified, said the\n\nAnglican Church has considered putting up lighting to thwart vandals at\n\nnight. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Meanwhile, family and friends of Christine and Brian Jack - many\n\nof them witnesses during the 10-week trial that began Sept. 10 - said they\'re\n\nglad the trial is over and are satisfied that justice was done. \n\n  " At least it\'s over.\n We can start to live our lives again, but we\'ll never forget our\n\ndaughter," Christine\'s mother, Valetei Reiter, said in an interview from her\n\nhome in New Jersey. \n\n  " I know deep in my heart Christine will never return to us.\n\n\n  She said she now must face one of the hardest tasks to come out\n\nof the conviction - telling the two Jack children. \n\n  " I haven\'t told them about the verdict yet.\n\n\n  She said the Jack children - seven-year-old Kirstin and\n\nnine-year-old Adam - will also likely be told about the circumstances\n\nsurrounding yesterday\'s verdict, including the fact their mother is likely\n\ndead. \n\n  With the verdict in, a memorial service for Christine can now be\n\nheld by friends and family, she said. \n\n  Lidijia Jancovec, an old family friend whom Christine considered\n\nan aunt, said from her Selkirk home that while the children haven\'t been\n\nspecifically told about all the circumstances surrounding the case, Adam has\n\nremarked that he " doesn\'t want to see his father because he hurt his\n\nmother." \n\n  Cheryl MacMillan, Christine\'s long-time friend, said yesterday\n\nshe believes Christine is dead and " if he did do it, it would be better if\n\nhe admitted it." \n\n  Jack\'s lawyer, Richard Wolson, said his client will be appealing\n\nthe verdict. \n\n  " I just met with Brian, he\'s somewhat downtrodden, very\n\ndisappointed in the verdict, but has confidence that somewhere down the line,\n\nhe will be vindicated," he said. \n\n  " He feels that he\'s not guilty.\n That\'s been his position from the very beginning and that\'s his\n\nposition today," Wolson said. \n\n  He said that as far as he is concerned, there is not proof beyond\n\na reasonable doubt that Christine is dead and that Brian killed her. \n\n  Among the points Wolson will be appealing will be how Winnipeg\n\npolice handled the investigation. \n\n  He has said that while all evidence pointing to Jack\'s guilt was\n\npursued, evidence that would vindicate him was ignored. \n\n  " one-sided and inadequate,"\n\n Wolson at one point during the trial asked for a mistrial on grounds\n\npolice withheld

It may go down in history as East and West\'s fare well\n\nto arms. \n\n  Prime Minister Mulroney and 33 leaders representing a billion\n\npeople will meet in Paris next week to consign the Iron Curtain to the scrap\n\nheap and mark a new era in Europe. \n\n  It will also see the redefining, if not gradual de-fanging, of\n\nthe two most powerful military groups in the world - NATO and the Warsaw\n\nPact. \n\n  The setting will be a milestone meeting of the Conference on\n\nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe, the 34-nation group that includes the\n\nSoviet Union and every European country except Albania.\n Unarmed San Marino and Vatican City, representing less than 20,000\n\npeople between them, will be seated alongside the superpowers  .\n\n  Canada and the United States, two of the nations that helped\n\nrebuild Europe following the Second World War, are also part of the\n\norganization set up in 1975. \n\n  The highlight of the meeting likely will be the signing Monday of\n\none of the most sweeping agreements on military cuts ever reached. \n\n  Negotiators for NATO and Warsaw Pact countries agreed this week\n\nto a deal that calls for deep cuts to non-nuclear arms stocks in Europe and\n\npermits surprise inspections to ensure both sides are complying with the\n\nagreement. \n\n  But senior officials at External Affairs caution against\n\nconcluding there is no further need for NATO. \n\n  " NATO is not on the way out," said one official, who spoke on\n\ncondition of anonymity.\n " Our view is that NATO will rise to the occasion, will demonstrate\n\nthat it has a place in the sun." \n\n  Modest diplomatic efforts will be made to solidify the tumultuous\n\nevents of the past year which led to the decline of communism in Eastern\n\nEurope and the rise of democratically elected governments, diplomats said.\n\n\n\n  The final summit declaration will see the leaders give their\n\nbenediction to the linchpin of the reintegrated continent: a unified Germany.\n\n\n\n  Europe\'s new chapter will be marked by what one diplomat called a\n\n" Magna Carta" of human rights for the future. \n\n  The CSCE will be institutionalized with a small secretariat in\n\nPrague, a Centre for the Prevention of Conflict in Vienna and an electoral\n\ncommission in Warsaw. \n\n  Canada is a strong backer of these efforts to establish a\n\nEuropean infrastructure to maintain peace, said one senior External Affairs\n\nofficial. \n\n  " Everything proceeds from our interests in Europe," he said.\n\n\n  Canada has substantial interest in enhancing trade prospects with\n\nEuropean nations as they head towards economic union in 1992.\n Canada is also eager to establish new investment and trade\n\nopportunities with former communist countries as they slowly embrace market\n\neconomics. \n\n  Mulroney will hold six bilateral meetings with European heads of\n\nstate, including a chat with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. \n\n  The meetings should give Mulroney a welcome break from domestic\n\nproblems and allow him to share the stage with prominent world leaders. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Canadian Press\n\n  MOSCOW - President Mikhail Gorbachev promised yesterday to shake\n\nup the Soviet government and top military leadership, then lashed out at\n\ncritics who he said are undermining the country\'s ability to work its way out\n\nof a deepening political and economic crisis. \n\n  But Gorbachev was immediately slammed right back by his\n\narch-rival, Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin, the leaders of most\n\nof the other 14 Soviet republics, radical reformers and hardline Communists.\n\n\n\n  The dramatic charges and counter-charges during an emergency\n\ndebate on the country\'s crisis came only a day after the United States,\n\nGermany and Japan indicated they are preparing to send food and medical aid\n\nto the Soviet Union this winter. \n\n  Canada, meanwhile, has no immediate plans to provide emergency\n\naid, officials said yesterday. \n\n  In Moscow, External Affairs Minister Joe Clark said he made no\n\npromises of food aid during a meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard\n\nShevardnadze. \n\n  In Ottawa, External Affairs spokesman Guy Archambault said such\n\naid to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe could be discussed next week as\n\nEuropean and North American leaders gather in Paris for a security conference\n\nto mark the official end of the Cold War.\n\n\n  The emergency debate in the Soviet national legislature was\n\nprompted by widespread reports of pending food shortages as well as a general\n\nbreakdown of society and ethnic violence.\n\n\n  " vile\n\nrumors"  and said the country could augment its own supplies with\n\nnormal imports. \n\n  But Yeltsin immediately countered by proposing strict rationing\n\nand immediate use of the Soviet Union\'s strategic food reserves to prevent\n\nwhat he called  " an explosion, ( that) could occur at any time."\n\n \n\n  " Pride should be pocketed and the west asked for food aid," he\n\nsaid. \n\n  Soviet legislators demanded the emergency debate earlier this\n\nweek    after   returning from a break in their\n\nconstituencies upset with the lack of action to deal with the worsening\n\ncrisis. \n\n  Gorbachev described some of the republican political leaders and\n\nother opponents as unprincipled, called for unity within his own circle of\n\nadvisers and accused critics of using  " slander and rumors" \n\nto attack him personally. \n\n  " outdated and clearly useless structures"\n\n of government will he scrapped within 10 days. \n\n  " One must reorganize the government with changes of people," he\n\nsaid.\n " One must renew ( the government) composition, bring in specialists\n\nand the most respected political figures, along with those who benefit from\n\nbroad popular support." \n\n  It wasn\'t immediately clear what kind of a shakeup he was\n\nproposing.   \n\n\n\n\n  MIAMI - An angry Manuel Noriega, swearing that he had no money to\n\nretain his lawyers, denounced the United States government in open court\n\nyesterday, claiming it had conspired to deny him a fair trial. \n\n  " They have taken my money, deprived me of my lawyers,\n\nvideo-taped me in my cell, wire-tapped my   \n\ntelephone   calls with my lawyers and even given them to the Endara\n\ngovernment and to the press," he told U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler.\n\n\n\n  In a sideshow to the government\'s case against Noriega yesterday,\n\nCable News Network repeated its charge that the FBI improperly took a box\n\ncontaining audio tapes from a CNN    reporter \n\n . \n\n  At issue is whether the tapes in the box had anything to do with\n\ntapes that CNN broadcast of conversations between Noriega and his defence\n\nteam.\n A court order barring the broadcast of more tapes is being appealed\n\nby CNN. \n\n  Speaking publicity for the first time since his January arrival\n\nin Miami, Noriega wondered why a nation as powerful as the United States was\n\nnow unable to unfreeze his overseas bank accounts. \n\n  " When I was the leader of the Republic of Panama, the United\n\nStates would ask many things of me," he said.\n " They would ask me to arrest people, to allow the search of\n\nPanamanian flag vessels, to send people to the United States for trial and to\n\nfreeze bank accounts.\n I know that when the United States seriously requests something of, a\n\nforeign government, they get it." \n\n  "\n\na sham."  \n\n \n\nwhich stated that none of his bank accounts or property is within his reach.\n\n\n\n  Noriega\'s attorneys told Hoeveler that they would have to\n\nwithdraw unless the judge raised a cap on the amount they could earn as\n\ncourt-appointed lawyers.  \n\n\n\n\n The Canadian Press\n\n  VANCOUVER - Murray Pezim, considered the driving force behind the\n\nVancouver Stock Exchange, won a split decision from the B.C. Securities\n\nCommission on yesterday after an insider-trading investigation. \n\n  The commission cleared Pezim and two other executives of\n\nintentional fraud in a series of stock deals involving the shares of two\n\nPezim-controlled companies. \n\n  But the three men may still face penalties because the commission\n\nfound the two companies had violated securities rules by not making timely\n\ndisclosure of important gold-drilling results. \n\n  Pezim, reached at his warm-weather retreat in Scottsdale, Ariz.,\n\ntreated the decision that he had not acted fraudulently as a victory. \n\n  " That\'s super," the flamboyant stock promoter said when he was\n\ntold he\'d been personally cleared.\n " It means that I\'ve been vindicated.\n I said I\'d be.\n\n\n  The commission said it plans to hold further hearings to\n\ndetermine whether penalties against Pezim and colleagues John Ivany and\n\nLawrence Page are warranted.  \n\n\n \'worth\n\nevery minute\'   \n\n\n  THIRTEEN YEARS ago, Joe Perreault purchased the old Vermette\n\ngrocery store and post office which sat on a 1.2-hectare site on St. Anne\'s\n\nRoad, south of the Perimeter Highway.\n While he rejuvenated and refurbished the old two-storey building,\n\ntransforming it into a rental residence, he knew that one day he would do\n\nsomething special with the property. \n\n  Thirteen months ago, Perreault bought a 960-square-foot\n\nbungalow from a neighbor next to his property.\n His plan was to move the house to the acreage, do some simple\n\nrenovating and return it into his retirement residence. \n\n  The house was moved last winter, with little fanfare or\n\ndifficulty, and it sat on two steel skid beams directly behind the " old\n\nhouse" until this spring.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'ceb8074a-e173-4e63-b6ae-218163f7349c', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.880030+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9724169373512268, 'non_english_score': 0.027583062648773193}

It suggested that socialists\n\n " organize and elect new leadership at the convention"\n\n to  " get control of the party again."  \n\n  Labour has taken up the magazine\'s call for using higher taxes on\n\nthe corporate sector to pay for new social programs.\n " It\'s time for the government to do more than deal with deficit\n\nbudgets," argues Barb Byers, president of the Saskatchewan Federa <l>\n\ntion of Labour, a former provincial social worker and an executive member of\n\nthe federal NDP.\n " It\'s time to turn our attention to the social justice issues."\n Agrees Jerry Sperling, an NDP activist and professor of journalism\n\nand political science at the University of Regina: "\n Things are likely to bubble over at the convention.\n The government has had its year of obsession with the deficit.\n Now it\'s time to get on with the program, to make an ideological\n\nbreak with the recent, right-wing past." \n\n  The left-wing revolt is delighting the NDP\'s political opponents.\n " It\'s the age-old NDP argument you can look after everyone by\n\nhitting the banks and the oil companies," offers Ken Azzopardi,\n\nexecutive director of the Progressive Conservative party.\n " Trouble is, it doesn\'t work."\n Mr. Azzopardi believes Premier Romanow knows higher corporate taxes\n\nwould simply result in the flight of capital out of Saskatchewan and the\n\nconsequent loss of desperately needed jobs.\n\n\ntween fiscal reality and socialist ideology.   \n\n  To mollify his left wing, Mr. Romanow has shuffled and enlarged\n\nhis cabinet.\n Berny Wiens, perceived as a conservative, was stripped of the\n\nagriculture ministry and replaced by the more accommodating Darrel\n\nCunningham.\n Similarly, junior finance minister Ned Shillington was shifted into\n\nlabour and succeeded by Janice McKinnon, formerly the minister of social\n\nservices.\n Filling the McKinnon vacancy is Saskatoon MLA Pat Atkinson whose ap\n\n<l> pointment Tory house leader Bill Neudorf describes as  " Romanow\'s\n\nconcession to the left wing of the party." \n But NDP insiders say the cabinet changes are unlikely to\n\nforestall a left-wing challenge to Mr. Romanow\'s leadership at the\n\nparty\'s convention. \n\n  A week after the NDP assemblage in early November, Saskatchewan\n\nTories will gather to choose a new executive whose first task will be to set\n\na date for the selection of a new leader.\n Former premier Grant Devine has announced his intention to step down\n\nas Tory chieftain Dec. 31.\n His government repudiated by the electorate one year ago, Mr.\n\nDevine will return to the University of Saskatchewan, where he will he\n\ninvolved in research work and fundraising for the college of\n\nagriculture. \n\n  Mr. Devine\'s deputy, Rick Swenson, will serve as interim leader\n\nuntil a new party boss is chosen, likely next fall.\n While names like Larry Schneider, John Gormley, Shirley\n\nSchneider, Bill McKnight, Geoff Wilson, Grant Schmidt and Bill Neudorf have\n\nbeen bandied about, one veteran Tory operative says that  " if\n\nyou know the name of the new leader, we\'re finished." \n His contention is that a complete outsider, unsullied by Devine\'s\n\nreputation for profligacy and patronage, is the  only\n\nhope for renewal. \n\n  While her party almost matched the Tories in popular vote in the\n\n1991 election, Liberal leader Lynda Haverstock managed to win only her\n\nown Saskatoon seat.\n She still hopes to supplant the Devine Tories as the free enterprise\n\nalternative to the Romanow socialists.\n And Liberal party executive suggests a byelection victory in Mr.\n\nDevine\'s Estevan riding would give Ms. Haverstock the edge she needs to begin\n\naccomplishing her goal. \n\n  In question is the Liberal leader\'s patience.\n Can she wait another three years in the political wilderness while\n\nrebuilding the province\'s Liberal party?\n Or will she succumb to the blandishments of Jean Chretien\'s federal\n\nGrits who have promised her a cabinet post if she wins Saskatoon\n\nHumboldt for them in next year\'s federal election?\n\n\n \n\nLiberals\'  plotting, Mr. Devine has craftily decided to retain his\n\nEstevan seat until he reckons the time is right for a byelection that will\n\nput another Tory into the Legislative Assembly.\n In his partisan view, the perfect time for selecting the new MLA for\n\nEstevan will be when the NDP is in disarray and the Liberals leaderless. \n\n \n\n\n\n Lower oil and gas taxes will create 2,000 jobs, Alberta\n\nexpects  \n\n  It was a long time coming, but the Alberta government finally\n\nacted last week to cut its " take" from the struggling oil and natural gas\n\nindustry which pours some &dollar;2 billion a year into the provincial\n\ntreasury.\n With Premier Don Getty doing the honours in Edmonton, Energy Minister\n\nRick Orman held a news conference in Calgary to unveil the first\n\nmajor change in the intricate royalty system in nearly 20 years.\n In an attempt to bolster the industry, the keystone of the\n\nprovincial economy, the government will forgo &dollar;43 million in\n\nresource taxes this year and a total of &dollar;1 billion over the next\n\nfive years under its new price-sensitive royalty regime.\n The Getty-Orman show played to mixed reviews in the oilpatch and drew\n\na withering critique in the  Calgary Herald  .   \n\n  " The old royalty system was archaic," Mr. Orman admitted last\n\nweek.\n Created in 1973, it was based on the premise that oil prices would\n\ncontinue to rise.\n That premise was proved false in 1986 when world prices plummeted.\n Since then, petroleum companies had been pleading for a royalty break\n\nas they laid off thousands of their employees and cut back substantially on\n\ndrilling.\n A year ago, the government responded with a two-year royalty\n\nholiday on new oil wells but it was not the stimulus the industry needed.\n The combination of low prices and high royalties, Mr. Orman said,\n\namounted to a  " disincentive to invest in our industry." \n\n\n\n  To restore incentives, the government has cut by nearly 15% the\n\nroyalty on newly discovered oil pools, reduced the rate for low-producing\n\nwells, capped royalties on horizontally drilled wells, reduced the take from\n\noilsands extraction, introduced a price sensitive mechanism so\n\nroyalties rise as oil and gas prices rise, and simplified the administration\n\nof natural gas royalties. \n\n  Gerry Angevine, president of the Canadian Energy Research\n\nInstitute in Calgary, predicted the new royalty structure will bring new\n\ninvestment in the industry.\n " more attractive to\n\nCanadian and foreign investors because they don\'t discriminate\n\nagainst foreign investment." \n And Al Hibbard, president of the Canadian Association of Oilwell\n\nDrilling Contractors, predicted 4,600 wells will be drilled this season,\n\nan increase of 600 over the number that would have been drilled under\n\nthe old royalty regime.\n The industry didn\'t get everything it asked for, said Gerry Protti,\n\npresident of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers,\n\nrepresenting 90% of oil and gas producers.\n\n\n  Calgary Herald\n\n wasn\'t happy.\n The newspaper was quite alone in attacking the new tax structure and\n\nin arguing the royalties should have been left as they were.\n Herald\n\n wrote.\n " No geologist, toolpush or rough-neck will be put to work."\n The paper\'s unsubstantiated claim flies in the face of Mr. Orman\'s\n\nprojection the new royalty regime will restore at least 2,000 oilpatch jobs.\n\n\n\n  Even NDP energy critic Bill Roberts was more supportive than the\n\n Herald  of the government\'s royalty changes.\n He called them " pretty progressive" and said they will be a far more\n\neffective job creation measure  " than pouring billions of dollar more\n\ninto the Husky upgrader and a NovAtel, for instance."  \n\n \n\n\n\n The would-be leader, trailing badly, cuts royalties and\n\nraises his profile  \n\n  Alberta\'s Energy Minister Rick Orman hopes to prove the adage\n\nthat in politics, timing is everything.\n Mr. Orman last week formally launched his campaign for the leadership\n\nof the Progressive Conservative party by attracting 300 supporters to an\n\nevent in Edmonton and 400 in Calgary.\n By accident or design, Mr. Orman and Premier Don Getty also chose\n\nlast week as the most propitious time to reveal the government\'s reduced\n\nroyalty regime for oil and gas. \n\n  The announcement\'s attendant publicity raised Mr. Orman\'s profile\n\namong PC party members and the general public just days before the Angus Reid\n\nGroup was scheduled to begin polling Albertans on the Tory leadership.\n A previous Reid poll, taken in early September, showed Mr. Orman\n\ntrailing far behind his chief rivals, Enviroment Minister Ralph Klein\n\nand Health Minister Nancy Betkowski.\n In that survey, Ms. Betkowski was favoured by 22% of current PC\n\nsupporters, Mr. Klein by 21% and Mr. Orman by only 4%.\n However, the poll was taken immediately after Premier Don Getty\'s\n\nresignation announcement and before the leadership contest began. \n\n  " Rich Orman didn\'t have much recognition in the first\n\npoll," observes the Reid Group\'s Bruce Cameron.\n " His visibility may have been low because he\'s done his job so well.\n He\'s been energy minister while the oilpatch hasn\'t been in the best\n\nof shape.\n Yet the government hasn\'t taken much heat and that could be because\n\nhe\'s one of the few in cabinet who is so respected, nobody has taken\n\nmuch notice of him."\n "\n\nbounce"  the energy minister gains from a new royalty policy more\n\nsympathetic to the needs of an industry in which thousands of jobs have\n\nbeen lost because of low oil prices. \n\n  The timing of another major announcement may also be working\n\nto Mr. Orman\'s benefit.\n\n\nleased the latest report on the Toward 2000 Together effort to develop a new\n\neconomic strategy for the province.\n Although Economic Development Minister Peter Elzinga was\n\nnominally responsible for the overseeing the process, Mr. Orman was\n\nfront and centre at the Calgary news conference at which the document was\n\nmade public.\n As chairman of cabinet\'s economic planning committee, the energy\n\nminister immediately laid claim to the report\'s recommendations to\n\nreduce the size of government, remove it from the marketplace by\n\nstopping grants and loan guarantees to businesses,  " provide a\n\ncompetitive tax environment,"  and foster rural development.\n\n\n\n  At the opening of his Calgary headquarters last week, Mr.\n\nOrman expanded on that theme.\n " It is time for us to get back to the fundamental values of the\n\nConservative party," he said.\n " individual initiative, free\n\nenterprise, self-reliance, high quality and efficient health care and\n\neducation, and a justice system that will protect the security of people and\n\ntheir property." \n He also used the occasion to take a potshot at Klein, further indi\n\n<l> cating he is convinced the environment minister, not Ms. Betkowski, is\n\nthe candidate to beat.\n Mr. Orman said many MLAs support him but he had no intention of\n\n " trotting them out in front of the cameras"  as Mr. Klein\n\ndid when he claimed to have the support of 22 MLAs.  \n\n  Mr. Orman did, however, trot out PC party functionaries who are\n\nsupporting his candidacy by working on his

{'text': 'Technicalities in the Elections Act mean the earliest Chretien can\n\ntake his place in Parliament is next Wednesday. \n\n  Mulroney said Chretien will come under pressure to be more\n\nforthcoming on the  political agenda.\n The Liberal leader will have to indicate where he stands on issues\n\nsuch as taxes and paying for government programs, Mulroney said. \n\n  Herb Gray, who has been the parliamentary leader for the Liberals\n\nsince the resignation of John Turner, said he thinks having Chretien in the\n\nCommons will help the country. \n\n  " He\'ll be speaking strongly for a united Canada," Gray predicted.\n\n\n\n  Chretien, who was elected eight times in his hometown of\n\nShawinigan, Que., sought out a seat in Beausejour, N.B., one of the safest\n\nLiberal ridings in the country.\n Chretien\'s personal popularity in Quebec has plummeted because of his\n\nposition on the Meech Lake constitutional accord. \n\n  Quebec-first MPs from the breakaway Bloc Quebecois yesterday said\n\nthey were also pleased Chretien will be in Commons  .\n\n  " It\'s good for us," said MP Louis Plamondon.\n " We now have assurance he will not win a French ( speaking) riding\n\nin Quebec.\n We have a chance to win 50 or 60 ridings.\n If Chretien didn\'t win then the party would have turned to [ Sheila]\n\nCopps or [ Paul] Martin [ MPs who ran for the Liberal leadership].\n The provincial Liberal party would support Copps or Martin but\n\nprovincial Liberals cannot support Chretien because he was against Meech\n\nLake," Plamondon said. \n\n  Bloc Quebecois leader Lucien Bouchard dismissed Chretien\'s\n\nvictory because it was not in Quebec.\n Bouchard told Canadian Press in Trois-Rivieres that Chretien will\n\nhave to run in Quebec in the next election.  \n\n\n\n\n  The federal " green plan" sets the stage for a series of\n\ndifficult negotiations with the provinces at a time when environmental\n\ndisputes between the two levels of government are heating up. \n\n  On almost every major issue, the green plan assumes\n\nfederal-provincial deals can be struck.\n It calls for agreements on goals ranging from improving forestry to\n\ncapping sulphur dioxide pollution, from restoring water quality to clamping\n\ndown on automobile exhaust. \n\n  Environment Minister Robert de Cotret said the &dollar;3 billion\n\nOttawa is promising to spend over five years should prime the pump of the\n\nprovincial treasuries and encourage municipalities and the private sector to\n\ncontribute. \n\n  " Obviously the &dollar;3 billion will probably lever additional\n\nmoney," de Cotret said.\n " In a number of areas we would like provincial participation, and in\n\nothers we would like to have community participation." \n\n  De Cotret has learned the hard way to tread cautiously around\n\nprovincial sensitivities.\n He suffered politically in a jurisdictional clash with Saskatchewan\n\nover the controversial Rafferty-Alameda dam project.\n Just last week, the provincial environment ministers demanded more\n\npower to conduct environmental reviews of projects under proposed federal\n\nlegislation. \n\n  " There are a lot of things one would have expected to be in [\n\nthe green plan] that are missing because [ Ottawa] clearly has not been able\n\nto come to agreements with some of the provinces," said David Runnalls,\n\ndirector of the Institute for Research on Public Policy\'s environment and\n\nsustainable development program. \n\n  If cooling off federal-provincial conflicts is one political goal\n\nof the green plan, another objective may be to set up a series of attractive\n\nenvironmental announcements for the government. \n\n  Since the green plan fails to specify the cost of more than 100\n\nproposals, individual projects will be launched separately as funding is\n\napproved by cabinet.\n New Democratic MP Jim Fulton predicted the government will exploit\n\ngreen plan announcements  " designed for local constituency benefits"\n\n in a bid to bolster its popularity before the next election. \n\n  The green plan is also designed to let federal departments share\n\nthe credit - and the money - for environmental work.\n Less than 50% of the &dollar;3 billion will be spent by Environment\n\nCanada itself. \n\n  De Cotret said the wide allocation of funds is evidence the\n\nentire government is commited to environmental change.\n But Liberal MP Paul Martin said de Cotret and his predecessor, former\n\nenvironment minister Lucien Bouchard,  " lost every single battle in\n\ncabinet"  during 18 months of wrangling over the green plan. \n\n\n\n\n ACID-RAIN LIMIT IS NEWS TO ALBERTA: But de Cotret expects\n\nprovinces to agree soon to national limit of 3.2M tonnes \n\n  Energy producers and government officials in Alberta say they\n\nwere not consulted about a proposal for a national cap on acid rain emissions\n\nin Ottawa\'s " green plan" and have no idea how the goal might be achieved.\n\n\n\n  Environment Minister Robert de Cotret, in unveiling the\n\n&dollar;3-billion, five-year environmental strategy in Ottawa yesterday, said\n\nhe expected an agreement soon with the provinces on setting a national cap on\n\nsulphur dioxide emissions of 3.2 million tonnes by the year 2000. \n\n  That agreement would set the stage for reaching a trans-boundary\n\nAir Quality Agreement with the U.S. before the end of the year, de Cotret\n\nsaid.\n The U.S. has been pressuring Canada to set a sulphur emissions cap\n\nsimilar to the limit it set in its recently approved Clean Air Act. \n\n  But government and industry sources in Alberta said yesterday\n\nthey were surprised to see the target in the green plan.\n They said federal officials did not ask them for any comment about\n\nthe proposal\'s feasibility or whether it overlapped with provincial\n\ninitiatives. \n\n  Ken Smith, Alberta\'s assistant deputy minister of environment in\n\nEdmonton, said: " There has been no decision or discussion about how [ the\n\nsulphur emissions cap] might be achieved ... what Western Canada\'s\n\napportionment of that would be.\n\n\n  Federal officials are " saying Canadians can live with [ the cap]\n\nbut how they\'re going to translate it back into the domestic Canadian scene\n\nand put it on the ground has not been discussed yet," Smith said. \n\n  He said provincial officials first saw the proposal during last\n\nweek\'s meeting of federal and provincial environment ministers in Victoria.\n\n\n\n  Doug Bruchet, an official with the Canadian Petroleum Association\n\nin Calgary, said the cap proposal also potentially conflicts with Ottawa\'s\n\ncommitment to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year\n\n2000. \n\n  He said capping sulphur emissions is an energy-intensive process\n\nwhich will lead to higher emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide.\n Alberta is also in the midst of a 26% expansion of natural gas\n\nproduction, which also leads to higher carbon dioxide emissions. \n\n  " They didn\'t talk to us about it and we don\'t know if the\n\nsulphur cap or stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions is achievable," Bruchet\n\nsaid. \n\n  The green plan outlined environmental initiatives in everything\n\nfrom sustainable fisheries to preserving Canada\'s historical heritage.\n But critics said it introduced few new proposals or pollution control\n\ntargets and set almost no new dates for reaching specific goals. \n\n  One business spokesman said, " It\'s like a table of contents for\n\na book that hasn\'t been written yet."  \n\n\n\n\n  A Quebec dollar would create financial uncertainty and so an\n\nindependent Quebec would want to negotiate a common monetary policy with\n\nCanada, Jacques Parizeau said yesterday. \n\n  It would also be willing to pay its share of the Canadian debt,\n\nhonor international agreements such as free trade with the U.S. and allow\n\neasy mobility across the Quebec-Canada border, said Parizeau, Opposition\n\nleader in the Quebec National Assembly and leader of the Parti Quebecois.\n\n\n\n  His message of continued economic co-operation was delivered in\n\nthe heart of English Canada\'s business community in a speech to Canadian and\n\nEmpire clubs in Toronto. \n\n  Parizeau said the rest of Canada should start thinking seriously\n\nof negotiating a new economic relationship with the province to allow for a\n\nstability after the separation. \n\n  Saying that " money talks," Parizeau said investors would not\n\nhave to worry about doing business in an independent Quebec. \n\n  Negotiations on economic matters should also begin before the\n\nemotions stemming from a breakup create a climate " too hot" for fruitful\n\ndiscussions. \n\n  " I want to discuss economic arrangements as early as possible in\n\nthat context - we\'re inevitably going to see emotions running pretty high.\n I want as soon as possible, before the flap starts, [ to put]\n\neconomic arguments and arrangements on the table and [ allow] as many people\n\nas possible to discuss them." \n\n  For its part, Quebec would want to negotiate a common currency\n\nwith Canada but would want to establish clear guidelines for it to be\n\nconsulted on monetary matters.\n " prefer to maintain a common monetary policy, if [\n\nit] could have some say in how it is run."  \n\n  Sharing the currency would be preferable to " instability"\n\ninherent in a Quebec currency and independent Quebec monetary policy,\n\nparticularly in view of Canadian currency and federal debt securities held by\n\nQuebecers, he said. \n\n\n  Transportation and communications should also be at the top of\n\nthe negotiations list.\n insist on maintaining water,\n\nroad and rail transportation, and communication links. \n\n  Quebec would shoulder its share of the federal debt upon\n\nseparation - a share that could be based on Quebec\'s population and portion\n\nof the gross national product. \n\n  It would also honor agreements between Canada and other nations,\n\nparticularly the Canada-U.S. free trade pact. \n\n  He said Quebec would strive to maintain mobility of population\n\nacross its boundaries, although problems could arise in complex situations of\n\npeople living in Quebec border towns and commuting to Ontario to work for\n\ncompanies there. \n\n  The PQ leader praised Quebec business groups for coming around to\n\nthe idea of sovereignty.\n He said the Mouvement Desjardins, Quebec\'s biggest financial group,\n\ncaused a " political earthquake" when it called for sovereignty during\n\nhearings of the Belanger-Campeau Commission examining options for the\n\nprovince\'s future.  \n\n\n\n\n  The Conservative majority in the Senate wants to force a vote on\n\nthe proposed goods and services tax tomorrow by asking the Speaker to allow\n\nthem to cut off liberal debate on the controversial bill. \n\n  Senator William Kelly and 52 other Conservative senators\n\ndelivered a petition to Speaker Guy Charbonneau yesterday asking him to give\n\nthem a chance to use their plurality to decide to vote on the bill. \n\n  " We believe it is now time for the Senate to exercise\n\nits right to vote on the question now before it," the letter said.\n " The rights to speak and delay are not absolute.\n\n\n \n\n  Liberal senators immediately began yelling to have the\n\nConservative letter rejected by the Speaker on procedural grounds.\n Charbonneau said he would consider the letter and rule on it later.\n Senator Allan MacEachen moved that the Senate adjourn, touching off\n\nyet another debate on whether that motion was allowable. \n\n  Charbonneau suspended sitting in the upper chamber until 5:45\n\np.m., when a Liberal motion presented Monday to adjourn debate on the GST\n\nbill temporarily was voted down.\n The Senate will convene at 2 p.m. today to consider Kelly\'s letter.\n\n\n\n  The letter says the 53 Tory signatories want to dispose of all\n\nquestions on the GST bill by 5:45 p.m. EST tomorrow. \n\n  More than 320 hours of Senate time has been spent on the bill\n\nsince the Senate resumed sitting in September.\n The proposed tax is scheduled to be implemented Jan. 1, 1991.\n The Senate must vote on the bill and give it royal assent before it\n\ncan be made into law.  \n\n\n\n Edmonton voters halfheartedly give their mayor three more\n\nyears  \n\n  Edmonton Mayor Jan Reimer was less than gracious in victory after\n\nvoters awarded her another three years in power last Monday.\n " I want to thank Edmontonians for rejecting smear-style\n\nAmerican politics,"  she declared in her acceptance speech.\n It was obvious the dart was aimed at challenger Bill Smith, even\n\nthough his campaign was more notable for its muddled thinking than its ma <l>\n\nlevolence.\n Still, the mayor may have good reason to be grouchy.\n Pre-election polls had forecast a runaway victory over Mr. Smith, but\n\nher win was not the rout she was hoping for.\n And the makeup of her new council has some predicting that the coming\n\nterm will be considerably more trying for her than the last. \n\n  It was a gritty campaign, with the electorate polarized over\n\nseveral issues including crime, prostitution, civic spending and the fate of\n\nthe municipal airport.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '27f12956-9bd9-4828-99d8-3db6edb49e50', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.882649+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9690358638763428, 'non_english_score': 0.030964136123657227}
{'text': 'Edmonton opts to keep the Muni, but the vote might be in vain\n\n \n\n  After weeks of hand-wringing and confusion, Edmontonians last\n\nweek took aim at a proposal to consolidate their two airports and shot it out\n\nof the sky.\n The decision to move all passenger flights from the municipal airport\n\n- just over a mile from the city centre - to the larger international\n\nairport - 13 miles south of the city - was made by city council in June.\n A group called Air Services for Tomorrow collected 45,000 signatures\n\nopposing the move, forcing a referendum.\n On election day, 54% of voters opted to keep the Muni open.\n But the vote, which cost the city an estimated &dollar;100,000, may\n\nprove meaningless. \n\n  The referendum was dogged by controversy from the outset.\n Critics charged the Edmonton Regional Airports Authority ( ERAA)\n\nbrowbeat the city into backing consolidation, and that economic studies\n\ncommissioned by the city were biased and inaccurate.\n And polls showed as many as one-third of city voters didn\'t\n\nunderstand the referendum question. \n\n  Council first approached the ERAA - a government-appointed agency\n\ncontrolling the international airport - in 1990, proposing that the\n\ngroup take control of the city-administered municipal.\n In March, ERAA replied that it would, but only if all passenger\n\nflights were moved to the larger international.\n Consolidation would cut airport costs, increase the number of direct\n\nflights serving the city and help stem the emergence of Calgary as\n\nAlberta\'s airline hub.\n\n\n  Air Services for Tomorrow, led by former provincial cabinet\n\nminister Dave King, responded with an aggressive campaign to save the\n\nMuni.\n " There is no reason I can see to consolidate flights, and every\n\nreason not to," he said.\n " We\'d lose 900 jobs and as much as &dollar;7 million in revenue.\n And for what?\n\n\n  Voters sided with Mr. King, much to the delight of Calgary.\n " The vote will cement forever Edmonton\'s second-rate\n\nstanding as an air centre in Alberta,"  wrote  Calgary Herald\n\n columnist Don Braid.\n\n Indeed, just two days after the vote, Air Canada announced that it\n\nwas dropping non-stop service between Edmonton and Ottawa, and routing the\n\ncity\'s red-eye flight to Toronto through Calgary.  \n\n\n\n  The electorate\'s wishes for the Muni may also prove pointless.\n According to Peter Watson, ERAA\'s chairman, the Air Canada and\n\nCanadian Airlines merger will result in consolidation regardless of what\n\nthe city does.\n The merged airline, he says, could save &dollar;15 million by flying\n\nout of a single airport, a bonanza the cash-strapped company is unlikely to\n\npass up.\n ERAA will work to convince it to choose the international.\n If that happens, he says, the municipal would start to lose\n\nmoney by the planeload, a loss city taxpayers would have to absorb. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Most political veterans say that a low voter turnout signals\n\neither frustrated pessimism with the system, or that people are so\n\ncontent that they are complacent.\n At 34%, the municipal turnout in Calgary last week was the city\'s\n\nlowest in 25 years.\n and\n\n Calgary Sun  to detect the dawn of a New Age in the over <l>\n\nwhelming return of Mayor Al Duerr, along with 11 of 12 incumbent\n\naldermen, it would appear simply that Calgarians are content with their cor\n\n<l> ner of the world.\n Mayor Duerr got the sort of majority usually enjoyed only by\n\ndictators in one-party states: 90.4%, outshining Ralph Klein\'s 90.1%\n\npopularity in 1986.\n The 148,389 votes bestowed upon the bland, bespectacled urban\n\nplanner gave him a lead of 144,000 over his nearest rival, proving once and\n\nfor all that charisma is not necessary for political success, even for\n\nan incumbent who has already pared 400 of 13,000 city jobs.   \n\n  Calgary\'s general contentment was almost as evident in its\n\n14 aldermanic races.\n Only one incumbent, Sharon Fisk in Ward 2, was ejected.\n The rookie alderman had never managed to live down having phoned the\n\nCalgary fire department for a safe lift home after a New Year\'s Eve party.\n She lost heavily to Edgemont community association president Joanne\n\nKerr.\n The only other changes: contractor David Bronconnier and radio\n\nhorticulturalist Barry Erskine won in vacant Wards 6 and 11.\n\n\nlenger Ann Blough in Ward 13, the recount deciding in favour of the\n\nincumbent.\n Yvonne Fritz of Ward 5 and Sue Higgins of Ward 12 won by acclamation.\n\n\n\n  There was similar stability in the city\'s public school board\n\nrace, notwithstanding a teacher wage settlement last winter that was triple\n\nthe rate of inflation and has already led to program cuts.\n The board will include new faces since four of its seven incumbents,\n\nincluding past chairman Margaret Lounds, declined to run again.\n Despite rising property taxes and soaring school fees,\n\nconservative ex-chairman Harald Gunderson was unable to take the Ward 3-4\n\nseat; it fell to newcomer Patti Grier.\n Frugal former trustee Scott Saville helped dump incumbent Ann Craig\n\nfrom the Ward 12-14 trusteeship, but lost to Connie Rosenstein.\n Despite school safety worries arising from last spring\'s murder of\n\nRyan Garrioch, anti-violence crusader Roberta McDonald was unable to win\n\nout-going chairman Margaret  Wards 6-7 seat; ex-trustee Dr.\n\nPaul Adams returned after being benched three years.\n Likewise, anti-violence advocate Linda Cornell failed to take empty\n\nWards 1-2, losing to newcomer Jennifer Pollock.\n In short, public school voters had a chance to speak clearly on\n\nviolence and costs, and most did not. \n\n  Despite much acrimonious debate, the Calgary Separate School\n\nBoard will see four familiar faces returning.\n The empty seat in Wards 13-14 went to newcomer Judy Look.\n The two incumbents unseated were chairman John Donnachie, the 12-year\n\nveteran from Wards 3-4, and Wards 6-7-8 trustee Jocelyn Burgener.\n The Separate School Board had been criticized for the secrecy of\n\nits budgetary process, and there was some suspicion that its incumbents\n\nwould be turned out   en masse   .\n Voters, however, vented most of their spleen upon the chairman.\n He will be replaced in Wards 3-4 by retired teacher Colin Maclsaac.\n\n\ndice against a woman applicant for the superintendent\'s job, also lost\n\nnarrowly to newcomer Lois Burke-Gaffney, wife of former trustee Frank\n\nBurke-Gaffney.\n Hers, however, was one of three races sufficiently close to\n\nrequire a recount.\n Likewise, the close victories of incumbent Lynn L\'Heureux in\n\nWards 9-10 and Linda Blasetti in Wards 1-2 were awaiting confirmation\n\nthis week. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n  The long-awaited National AIDS strategy promised by Federal\n\nHealth Minister Perrin Beatty for the end of 1989 has been delayed again.\n According to Alastair Clayton, of the Federal Centre for AIDS,\n\nsuch a strategy will not be ready until next summer.\n Other federal officials suggest that the strategy will not be ready\n\nuntil the spring.\n And this is in the eighth year of the impact of the AIDS epidemic on\n\nCanadian society - eight years of criminal federal neglect of the needs\n\nand concerns of people living with AIDS and HIV. \n\n  " working document for development\n\nof a National Strategy on HIV infection and AIDS"  was prepared by\n\nSadinsky and Associates ( who have no special expertise on AIDS / HIV)\n\nfor Health and Welfare Canada in October 1989.\n This working document was to provide the basis for consultation\n\nbetween various state, professional and community-based groups and to\n\nlead towards a national strategy by the end of 1989. \n\n  This document, the many flaws and limitations of which will be\n\nmentioned below, is being held up according to Clayton because of the delay\n\nin consultation with the provinces and with non-governmental\n\norganizations.\n Apparently a number of provinces have been slow in responding to\n\nthis document.\n The delay has angered the Canadian AIDS Society ( CAS - a coalition\n\nof AIDS community groups) and others who fear that their core-funding\n\nwill be endangered if there is no National Strategy soon ( many cannot\n\nwait another six months to find out if there basic funding will continue\n\nor not), and who want other positive AIDS action in the very near future.\n\n\n\n  It appears that there may be substantial differences within\n\nthe provincial and federal AIDS and health bureaucracies over what\n\nstrategy to adopt in dealing with AIDS.\n Interestingly, the future of institutions like the Federal\n\nCentre for AIDS was not even mentioned in the draft strategy document. \n\n  Perrin Beatty promised community-based AIDS groups and AIDS\n\nactivists that he was going to be very different from his predecessor, Jake\n\nEpp.\n He promised that he wanted to consult with AIDS groups and with\n\ngroups representing people living with AIDS ( PLWAs) and with others to\n\nfinally develop a National AIDS Strategy.\n Some AIDS activists warned at the time that there were dangers in\n\nfalling for such a period of " consultation" if we did not visibly\n\nkeep up the political pressure on the federal government and health bur <l>\n\neaucracy.\n A lengthy process of dialogue and consultation, it was feared,\n\ncould lead to a lessening of a pressure on the federal front for positive\n\nAIDS action.\n What has happened is that most AIDS groups did opt for giving Beatty\n\nsome time for this process of consultation.\n As a result pressure for action has slipped on the federal level as\n\ngroups met with Sadinsky and his associates or with Beatty and as valuable\n\nmonths have slipped by with no action being taken. \n\n  Some had assumed that Alastair Clayton of the Federal Centre for\n\nAIDS was on his way out.\n In his long term in office he has done virtually nothing to help\n\nPLWAs regarding treatment delivery concerns.\n Many have been surprised to see that he is still around and is being\n\nquoted as a federal spokesman on AIDS policy issues.\n There has been no positive federal action which has not been the\n\ndirect result of the initiatives of AIDS activists. \n\n  Beatty has now been Health Minister for a year and aside from\n\nputting forward a nice liberal smiling face he has done virtually noth\n\n<l> ing for PLWAs / HIV.\n The recent announcement of funding for haemophiliacs who have\n\nacquired HIV infection through blood products, a measure to assure\n\nCanadians of the safety of the Canadian blood system, angered many AIDS activ\n\n<l> ists and representatives of community-based AIDS groups since it\n\ngave funding to only one group of PLWAS / HIV rather than all of them (\n\ndivide and conquer?) and because it seemed to play on the distinction between\n\n" innocent" ( like haemophiliacs) and " guilty" ( those who may have\n\ndeveloped HIV infection through sexual or drug-related activities) PLWAs\n\n/ HIV.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  New York - Although the eleventh annual membership confer\n\n<l> ence of the North American Man / Boy Love Association ( NAMBLA) was held\n\nas planned November 11-12, the organization\'s plans to hold a poetry reading\n\nwith Allen Ginsberg in the Lesbian and Gay Community Centre was vetoed\n\nby a vote of the Centre\'s board of directors, which denied the use of the\n\nfacility to the group. \n\n  Not only did the Centre\'s board refuse to give any reason for its\n\naction, it also instructed the director to not even release a tally of\n\nits vote on the issue. \n\n  The board\'s decision raised concerns among the activists\n\nabout its power to block activities considered controversial.\n " The Community Centre is discriminating against a group that is part\n\nof the gay community.\n They should either let NAMBLA use the facility, or take " \'community\'\n\n" out of their name," said New York lawyer and AIDS activist Bill\n\nDobbs. \n\n  NAMBLA, which describes itself as " a political and\n\neducational organization for men and boys interested in consensual\n\nsexual and emotional relationships," characterized its exclusion as\n\n " censorship."  \n\n  " We were told in September that space was available, but that\n\nsince the request was from NAMBLA, we would have to filter it through the\n\nboard of directors," said Chris Farrell, a NAMBLA spokesperson.\n\n\n  " In the wake of the Mapplethorpe controversy, I don\'t think that\n\ngays and lesbians want to be told what kinds of homoerotic expression can be\n\nshown in an art gallery or on safe-sex posters, let alone what poetry

{'text': 'The first\n\nwoman mayor.  \n\n  When Red Deer\'s 12-year-veteran mayor Bob McGhee chose not to\n\nrun again, it set up the closest-fought mayoralty race in Alberta.\n Into the ring stepped three aldermen, Gail Surkan, Dennis Moffat and\n\nJohn Campbell.\n When the counting was finished, it was 44-year-old Mrs. Surkan\n\nwho took the winner\'s podium.\n But the city\'s first woman mayor didn\'t win by much.\n She took 6,759 of the 17,115 ballots cast, finishing less than 700\n\nvotes ahead of second-place Mr. Moffat with 6,056.\n Mr. Campbell finished third with 4,113 votes.\n The 43% turnout was the highest of the last three municipal\n\nelections, as voters responded to the high-profile campaign by three credible\n\ncandidates. \n\n  By election day none of the three had emerged as a clear\n\nfrontrunner.\n Mr. Campbell seemed to have taken an early lead by focusing attention\n\non taxation: council, he said, should commit itself to a 0% tax increase.\n Mrs. Surkan, who enjoyed the support of local MLA Stockwell Day,\n\nparried by asserting that council had already agreed to this in principle, if\n\nnot in specific legislation.\n The debate soon focused on who was best qualified to replace the\n\nwell-respected Mr. McGhee.\n old\n\n  boy on council"  Mr. Moffat excelled. \n\n  As the votes were counted, Mr. Moffat seized an early lead.\n By the middle of the count Mrs. Surkan had pulled ahead.\n The election was so close, however, that defeat was not conceded\n\nuntil the very last poll. \n\n  The candidacy of the three aldermen also opened the door for new\n\nfaces on council.\n That prompted 22 candidates to vie for the eight available spots.\n Although four of five incumbents were re-elected, the resulting\n\ncouncil is considerably younger than the previous group.\n The youngest, 24-year-old Jason Volk, edged out 18-year council\n\nveteran Roy McGregor by 100 votes for the final seat. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  St. Albert ratepayers have grudgingly tolerated some of the\n\nhighest property taxes in the province.\n In last week\'s civic election, voters showed annoyance at their tax\n\nburden.\n\n\n  Anti-tax crusader Bob Russell had challenged mayor Anita\n\nRatchinsky on her record of taxation and openness in the budgeting process.\n The former leader of the provincial Liberal party, a perennial\n\npolitician who has run and lost both federally and provincially, found 6,586\n\nvoters who agreed with his tough stand on spending.\n But another 6,988 chose to stand by Mrs. Ratchinsky.\n\n\n  The city, bordering Edmonton to its north, has been grumbling\n\nabout high taxes for years.\n In November, 1991 the grumble nearly grew to a roar when council\n\nunder Mrs. Ratchinsky proposed a 9.7% tax increase.\n The Challenge Tax Group, led by Ross Guffei, began to hammer city\n\ncouncil on the tax issue, pinpointing specific areas where spending could be\n\ncut. \n\n  Bob Russell, then an alderman on council, saw opportunity in the\n\ngrowing discontent and became Mrs. Ratchinsky\'s fiercest opponent on council.\n This fall he decided to try for the mayor\'s chair.\n Never one to bow to tradition, he invoked the ire of established\n\npoliticians and some electors when he violated a " gentlemen\'s\n\nagreement" by beginning his campaign two weeks prior to nomination day. \n\n  That set the tone for a controversial and bitterly fought run for\n\nthe mayor\'s chair.\n The final vote proved a growing number of St. Albert residents are\n\nnot buying Mrs. Ratchinsky\'s assurances the tax hikes are reasonable.\n But it doesn\'t look like the re-elected mayor got the message.\n The primary job of the new government, she said, will not be to lower\n\ntaxes but to correct the perception that citizens are actually overtaxed.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n  Regardless of how hard pollsters and journalists strive for\n\nprescience, elections remain unpredictable things.\n The point was driven home to Fort McMurray incumbent mayor Betty\n\nColicott when she was surprisingly beaten by former alderman Guy Boutilier.\n At 33, Mr. Boutilier becomes one of the youngest sitting mayors in\n\nCanada.\n And after one term in office, Mrs. Colicott becomes the only incum\n\n<l> bent city mayor in Alberta to get the boot in 1992. \n\n  Mrs. Colicott was put on the defensive early in the campaign as\n\nMr. Boutilier brought new issues into the contest weekly.\n Key to his victory was voter discontent with excessively high\n\ntaxation.\n With a small industrial base, property taxes in the city are the\n\nsecond-highest in Alberta and account for 80% of city revenue.   \n\n  Mr. Boutilier proposed to reduce the load on homeowners by\n\nannexing the Suncor and Syncrude oil sands, 25 miles out of the city.\n Mrs. Colicott replied the idea was unfeasible, but was unable to\n\nprovide an alternative.\n Similar scenarios were played out with Mr. Boutilier\'s suggestions to\n\nestablish a youth committee to liaise with council, and to clean up a local\n\nwaterway used to land float planes.\n The constant hammering resulted in Mr. Boutilier edging Mrs.\n\nColicott by 5,039 votes to 4,390. \n\n  A third candidate, Robert Plews, provided comic relief.\n He set up his campaign office in a local bar and took pot shots at\n\nthe mainstream candidates.\n Although he collected only 603 votes, he remains undaunted.\n " I\'ll run federally in the next election," he says.\n " I\'ve got all those signs.\n I\'ll just spray-paint " \'MP\' " over " \'Mayor\'\n\n" ." \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nphotograph  \n\n  Medicine Hat Mayor Edward ( Ted) Grimm was not particularly\n\nworried about his seat going into this year\'s election.\n Mayor for the previous 18 years, he was solidly entrenched\n\nin the job.\n His confidence was justified, as he walked away from the election\n\nwith 75% of the vote and another three years in office.\n But there was still discontent in Medicine Hat.\n Voters were angry at the city\'s economic stagnation and\n\ncouncil\'s inability to combat it.\n And half of the incumbent council felt the sting of the voter\'s\n\nire: four of the eight seats will be occupied by rookies this term. \n\n  According to newcomers George Renner, the turnover comes from a\n\ncommon belief that Lethbridge, Red Deer and other mid-sized Alberta cities\n\nare leaving Medicine Hat in the economic dust.\n " People just didn\'t think the old council was hustling enough for\n\nnew business," he says, pointing to Pratt and Whitney Canada\'s decision last\n\nyear to locate their &dollar;145-million aerospace facility in Lethbridge\n\nafter Medicine Hat expressed little interest in the plant.\n " I don\'t know that we could have won the deal," he says, " but our\n\ncouncil didn\'t even try."\n Medicine Hatters, in turn, opted for a business-oriented council.\n\n\n  Not even the city\'s popular mayor proved exempt from the\n\ncommunity dissatisfaction.\n Mr. Grimm\'s only serious challenger was Robbie Middleton, a\n\n32-year-old unemployed carpenter with no experience and no money.\n Though Mr. Middleton purchased no commercial advertising, had no\n\nelection committee and claimed no corporate sponsors, he managed to rake in\n\n3,689 votes. \n\n \n\n\n\n strike\n\n   \n\n  The retirement of former Grande Prairie mayor Dwight Logan seemed\n\nto throw open the doors of the mayor\'s office to all comers.\n Despite the lack of an incumbent - Mr. Logan is now the provincial\n\nLiberal candidate for the riding - the race was decidedly one-sided.\n Unemployed taxi driver David Twombly had barely begun his campaign\n\nbefore winner Gord Graydon was arranging his knick-knacks on the mayor\'s\n\nbookshelf.\n That allowed city voters to concentrate on the race for school\n\ncouncil - with dire results for the incumbents. \n\n  Mr. Graydon, an alderman for the last nine years, claimed the\n\nadvantage of experience over his only opponent.\n Lacking any concrete issues on which to challenge Mr. Graydon, Mr.\n\n   Twombly   resorted to unsubstantiated claims\n\nof overspending by council.\n Voters didn\'t buy it.\n They opted by a 5-1 margin for Mr. Graydon.\n The aldermanic race was similarly unexciting with all but one of the\n\nincumbents who ran for re-election retaining their seats.\n\n\n  That allowed voters to focus attention on the school board, and\n\ntheir gaze was deadly to last year\'s council.\n\n\nteachers\'  strike last March.\n Although negotiators reached an early agreement in the dispute, the\n\nboard rejected it, a move many thought prolonged the conflict.\n Two members of the five-man council decided - wisely, some thought -\n\nnot to run for re-election.\n Of the three who did, only board chairman Ken Chomyc survived;\n\nincumbents Tom Shields and Tom Zasadny were soundly defeated, leaving the\n\nboard with four rookies in five spots. \n\n  The newcomers are all either married to teachers or have children\n\nin the school system.\n The result is expected to create a more harmonious relationship with\n\nschool staff.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nphotograph  \n\n  Nobody in Lethbridge expected two-term mayoralty incumbent David\n\nCarpenter to lose to his only opponent, six-year aldermanic veteran, Ruth\n\nElzinga.\n People did expect something of a race, however, and were\n\nsurprised when Mr. Carpenter won by a 3-1 margin.\n The source of Mrs. Elzinga\'s travails and the surprising ease\n\nof Mr. Carpenter\'s win had less to do with this election than the last one.\n\n\n\n  In 1989, council victors were united on the need for economic\n\ndevelopment.\n Shortly after the election, that committment was put to the test.\n The local Molson\'s brewery decided to move its plant, located on the\n\nedge of Lethbridge\'s downtown district.\n Fortunately for area farmers selling barley to Molson, another\n\ncompany, Centennial Foods Ltd., expressed a desire to take over the plant and\n\nconvert it to processing barley as food.\n But in a 5-4 vote, council decided to rezone the area, hoping to get\n\nrid of an eyesore so close to the city core.\n\n\n  A committee led by local barley growers was struck, vowing to\n\nget revenge in the next election on the " gang of five" who had rejected\n\nCentennial  offer.\n Most people had forgotten the issue by October of this year.\n But true to its word, the committee resurfaced and hammered\n\ncandidates on the question. \n\n  Mrs. Elzinga was one of the five who had supported the rezoning\n\nand became a prime target for the angry farmers.\n Of the remaining four members of the gang, one wisely retired, two\n\nwere defeated in their re-election attempts, and one retained his seat by a\n\nnarrow margin.\n But fortune smiled on Mr. Carpenter.\n He was one of the minority who had supported Centennial\'s bid.\n And he won even more acclaim last year when Pratt and Whitney Canada\n\nchose to locate a &dollar;145 million aerospace facility in the city.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n A community group is called racist for opposing low-cost\n\nhousing  \n\n  Ever since Ottawa transferred the Prince of Wales Armoury to\n\nEdmonton 10 years ago, the property has been slated for development.\n Last year the city initiated a consultation process to decide what\n\nkind of housing should be built on the armoury\'s 11 acres of land, just north\n\nof downtown.\n The city planning department had hoped to bring a proposal before\n\ncouncil by Christmas.\n But last month talks broke off when immigrant action groups accused\n\nthe local community league of racism. \n\n  The flash point was the Central McDougall Community\n\nLeague\'s rejection of proposals that subsidised, low-cost housing be\n\nbuilt on the site.\n Zedingle Ghebremusse, spokesman for the Immigrant Neighbourhood\n\nPlanning Group, says members of the league made racist comments in opposing\n\nthe idea.\n " There is the perception that affordable housing means slums,"\n\nhe says.\n " When feelings like this come out, the victims are always\n\nimmigrants." \n\n  Janice Fleming, the community league\'s president, insists the\n\nclaims of racism are unfounded.\n McDougall already has ample low-cost housing, says Ms. Fleming.\n Adding more would attract a transient population and\n\nworsen the community\'s crime problem.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5e1be9ee-fd2c-40ff-8ccd-c85064706517', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.885102+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9806146025657654,

{'text': "employment Insurance benefits.\n However, it isn't the last word.\n\n\n  If you are in doubt on any point, ask for explanations and more\n\ninformation at a Canada Employment Centre ( CEC).\n The centres have UI agents and employment counsellors whose jobs are\n\nto make certain that you get all the benefits to which you are entitled,\n\nwhile helping you get back into the work force. \n\n  The CEC is a good place to start if you are looking for a job or\n\nplanning to change jobs.\n Each CEC has a job board which posts available jobs in the area and\n\ndisplays a collection of publications, most of which are free.\n These include brochures on how to prepare résumés, on\n\nhow to look for jobs, on other UI benefits and on training programs. \n\n  Check the various programs offered by the Canada Employment\n\nCentre.\n\n\n\n\n  Go to your local Canada Employment Centre.\n\n\n\n  You can receive UI regular benefits if you lose your job and you\n\ncan't find work, provided that you meet certain requirements. \n\n  &bullet; You have paid into the UI account ( usually through\n\ndeductions from your pay cheque when you were working). \n\n  &bullet; You have worked a minimum number of weeks within the\n\nlast 52 weeks or since the start of your last UI claim, whichever is\n\nshortest.\n That minimum varies depending on where you live because it is\n\ndetermined by the unemployment rate in your area.* \n\n  * Two exceptions: In your first job ever, or your first job after\n\ncoming back into the work force after an absence of two years or more, you\n\nwill need 20 weeks of work to qualify regardless of the local unemployment\n\nrate. \n\n  Regular UI benefits are paid to people who are available\n\nfor and able to work, but who can't find work.  \n\n\n  Fill out an Unemployment Insurance application form which you can\n\nget at any Canada Employment Centre.\n\n &bullet; Your Social Insurance Number ( SIN).\n ( If you have lost your card and don't know your number, you can\n\napply for another at the CEC.\n The replacement costs &dollar;10.)\n &bullet; Your Record of Employment ( ROE).\n This is a form your employer must give you.\n It tells how long you worked and how much you earned with that\n\nemployer.\n If you have more than one ROE ( that is, if you have worked for more\n\nthan one employer within the last 52 weeks), attach all your ROEs to your\n\napplication because they could affect your benefits. \n\n  You should fill out your application even if you don't have all\n\nthe information you need.\n You can send the information later, and explain why you don't have it\n\non the application form. \n\n  Fill out your application form as soon as you are out of\n\nwork even if:  <l>\n\n &bullet; you don't have all the information.\n\n\n\n  When you claim UI benefits, there is a two-week waiting period.\n No benefits are paid for that period.\n\n\n  If you qualify for benefits, you will then receive a claimant's\n\nreport card by mail which you must fill out and return for every two-week\n\nperiod you are claiming UI benefits.\n in the envelope provided\n\n within three weeks of the date for which you are claiming benefits,\n\notherwise you may not get your benefit. \n\n  A cheque cannot be issued to you without a completed claimant's\n\nreport.\n If everything is in order, it usually takes a few weeks for your\n\nfirst cheque to arrive.\n After that you should receive your benefit cheque every two weeks as\n\nlong as you have sent your report card in on time. \n\n  These cards are important.\n be careful\n\nnot to date it before the date indicated on the card because that could delay\n\nyour claim.  \n\n\n  On your first benefit cheque stub, you will find a special\n\ntelephone access code ( TAC) which is yours alone and will help you make\n\ntelephone enquiries about your claim.\n The code identifies you to make certain that your privacy is kept\n\nsafe.\n Don't let others have it because they could get information or take\n\naction on your UI claim without you knowing. \n\n  Have the telephone access code and Social Insurance Number handy\n\nwhen you make a call - it will make it easier for everyone. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n  UI benefits don't last forever.\n\n\n\n  In most of the cases, you will receive 55% of your insurable\n\nearnings.\n However, if you earn &dollar;408 a week or less and you have a\n\ndependent, you can receive 60%.\n\n\n \n\n You earn &dollar;408 or less per week and you have a dependent, you\n\ncan receive 60% up to a maximum of &dollar;245 a week, ( 60% of &dollar;408 =\n\n&dollar;245) \n\n \n\n You earn &dollar;408 or less per week and you do not have a\n\ndependent, you can receive 55% up to a maximum of &dollar;224 per week.\n\n\n \n\n You earn more than &dollar;445 a week, you can receive 55% of your\n\ninsurable earnings. \n\n \n\n You earn between &dollar;408 and &dollar;445 a week and you have a\n\ndependent, you will automatically receive &dollar;245 a week in UI benefits.\n\n\n\n \n\n You earn between &dollar;408 and &dollar;445 a week and you do not\n\nhave a dependent, you can receive 55% of your insurable earnings. \n\n\n  There are two types of earnings for the purposes of UI.\n &bullet; Earnings on separation: money you get from your employer\n\nwhen you leave your job.\n &bullet; Earnings while on UI: money you earn at the same time as you\n\nare collecting UI benefits. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n  This money will delay the payment of your UI benefit, but will\n\nnot reduce the number of weeks you can collect UI.\n You cannot draw UI benefits during the time covered by this pay, but\n\nyou should apply as soon as you have officially left your job. \n\n  Payment of benefits can start when your separation payments have\n\nbeen used up. \n\n \n\n If you receive 12 weeks of severance pay, whether in a lump sum or\n\nweekly, UI benefits would be delayed for 12 weeks. \n\n  which could affect\n\nthe amount of benefits you receive include: <l>\n\n\n\n\n &bullet; retirement income from an employment pension, military or\n\npolice pension, Canada or Quebec Pension Plans or provincial plans based on\n\nemployment. \n\n  Pension income that does not affect your UI benefits includes:\n\n<l>\n\n\n\n\n  If you are receiving regular UI benefits, you can earn up to 25\n\npercent of your weekly amount without it being affected. \n\n  All earnings above that limit will be deducted dollar for dollar\n\nfrom your weekly UI benefits. \n\n  If you are receiving maternity, parental or sickness UI\n\nbenefits, any earnings at all are deducted dollar for dollar from your\n\nbenefit.\n\n\n \n\n If you receive &dollar;200 in UI every week, you can earn up to\n\n&dollar;50 a week and still receive your full benefits. \n\n \n\n \n\n Please contact your local Canada Employment Centre for more\n\ninformation. \n\n\n  Unemployment Insurance is a financial safety net for Canadians\n\nto protect them from hardship when they lose their jobs and while they are\n\nlooking for another.\n The right to receive benefits, however, is balanced by the\n\nresponsibility of each person to abide by the requirements of the law. \n\n \n &bullet; file a claim for Unemployment Insurance;\n &bullet; have help making your claim;\n &bullet; get help in looking for a job;\n\n &bullet; appeal any decision about your benefits which you feel is\n\nunjust. \n\n \n &bullet;

3. discrimination because of race, colour or religion; 4. working\n\nconditions that endanger your health or safety; 5. the necessity of caring\n\nfor a child or another member of your immediate family; 6. reasonable\n\nassurance of another job in the immediate future; 7. major changes in the\n\nterms and conditions of your job affecting wages or salary; 8. excessive\n\novertime or an employer's refusal to pay for overtime work; 9. major changes\n\nin work duties; 10. difficult relations with a supervisor, for which you are\n\nnot primarily responsible; 11. your employer is doing things which break the\n\nlaw; 12. discrimination because of membership in an association, organization\n\nor union of workers; and13. pressure from your employer or fellow\n\nworkers to make you quit.\n Other reasonable circumstances could be considered as just cause to\n\nensure fair treatment. \n\n\n  When companies reduce the size of their work force, Unemployment\n\nInsurance will help them and their employees get through the process.\n If your employer is downsizing, you may leave your job without UI\n\npenalties providing that the company shows that the layoffs will be permanent\n\nand that, with you leaving, you are protecting another person's job. \n\n  When faced with downsizing, it is best to consult first with the\n\nCEC to make certain of all conditions which might affect you directly.\n\n\n\n  Many different circumstances surround UI applications and the\n\nrules on benefits.\n Human Resources Development always tries to be fair but you might\n\nnot agree with a decision.\n You may want to talk about this to a UI agent, bringing in any new\n\ninformation you have and making sure that you understand why the decision was\n\nmade. \n\n  If you still want to appeal, you must write to your local CEC\n\nstating clearly why you wish to appeal to the  Board of Referees\n\n .", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'eb837907-f5bc-4dfb-bf52-11f11b3d88cd', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.886629+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9665655493736267, 'non_english_score': 0.03343445062637329}

- the indirect costs of the legal process (\n\nex.: lost earnings of the employee who must wait for the decision of the\n\nlabour commissioner; interest which, for the employer, is added to the\n\namounts claimed by the employee, etc.); - the Act; - the legal process; - the\n\nemployer's real reasons and motivations; - what the employee wishes to obtain\n\nby filing a complaint. \n\n  All is still possible during mediation, including harmonious\n\nreinstatement. \n\n\n  The mediator appointed by the Commission is chosen from the\n\nqualified staff of the Commission's regional office where the complaint was\n\nfiled.\n To insure the objectivity of mediation, this person may not have\n\nacted in another capacity in the matter in question.\n Similarly, all the information that the employee and the\n\nemployer give to the mediator remains confidential, and no one may compel\n\nthem to divulge such information.\n These guarantees are given to the employee and the employer under\n\nsection 123.3 of the  Act respecting Labour Standards  : <l>\n\n&bullet; 123.3.\n The Commission, with the agreement of the parties, may appoint a\n\nperson who shall endeavour to settle the complaint to the satisfaction of the\n\nparties. &bullet; Only a person who has not already acted in the matter in\n\nquestion in another capacity may be appointed for this purpose by the\n\nCommission. &bullet; Any verbal or written information gathered by the per\n\n<l> son appointed under the first paragraph must remain confidential.\n He may not be compelled to divulge anything that has been revealed to\n\nhim or that has come to his knowledge in the performance of his duties, or to\n\nproduce before a court or before any body or person fulfilling a judicial or\n\nquasi-judicial function any document made or obtained in the performance of\n\nhis duties, except in penal matters, where the court considers that such\n\nproof is necessary for a full and complete defence.\n Act respecting Access to\n\ndocuments held by public bodies and the Protection of personal information\n\n ( chapter A-2.1), no person shall have a right of access to any such\n\ndocument. \n\n\n  The mediator does not take sides with the employee or the\n\nemployer.\n His role is:- to allow each party to present his perception of\n\nthe facts; - to identify the cause of the conflict; - to inform the employer\n\nand the employee of their obligations and rights under the Act; - to help\n\neach party to clearly and objectively evaluate the situation; - to contribute\n\nto settlement proposals. \n\n  In the performance of his duties, the mediator is governed by a\n\ncode of ethics.\n\n\n  The Commission also offers the employee and the employer the\n\nopportunity to consult any precedents relating to the dispute opposing them.\n\n\n\n  If a settlement is reached, the Commission advises the parties on\n\nhow to implement it. \n\n  If no settlement is reached, a labour commissioner will hear the\n\ncase and will deal with the complaint. \n\n\n  Act\n\nrespecting Labour Standards  . \n\n  However, some employees are totally or partially excluded\n\nfrom the application of the Act.\n This is true, in particular, for:- employees whose\n\nexclusive duty, in a dwelling, is to take care of or provide care to a child,\n\nto a sick, handicapped or aged person, including, when so required, the\n\nperformance of domestic duties that are directly related to the immediate\n\nneeds of that person, if that work does not serve to procure profit to the\n\nemployer; - the employees of a farm usually employing not more than three\n\npersons ( these employees are subject to the Act, except respecting overtime\n\nand the section of the Act dealing with wages); - the employees governed by\n\nthe  Act respecting labour relations, vocational training and\n\nmanpower training in the construction industry  ( however, these\n\nemployees benefit from the right to certain family leaves and the right to\n\nremain at work beyond the normal retirement age);

The Politani has so far produced\n\n230 graduates. 2. The Politani has developed extensive collaboration with\n\nlocal and international NGOs, and government programs. 3.

{'text': 'This booklet contains information you may want or need to know\n\nabout Mountain Equipment Co-coperative. \n\n  Over 700,000 members are pleased to welcome you into Canada\'s\n\nlargest and most dynamic outdoor recreational equipment co-operative. \n\n  MOUNTAIN EQUIPMENT CO-OPERATIVE ( MEC) IS A MEMBER OWNED AND\n\nDIRECTED RETAIL CONSUMER CO-OPERATIVE WHICH PROVIDES PRODUCTS AND SERVICES\n\nFOR SELF-PROPELLED WILDERNESS ORIENTED RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS\n\nHIKING AND MOUNTAINEERING, AT THE LOWEST REASONABLE PRICE IN AN INFORMATIVE,\n\nHELPFUL AND ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER. \n\n\n  Mountain Equipment Co-op ( MEC) was founded in 1971 by a small\n\ngroup of members of the University of British Columbia\'s Varsity Outdoors\n\nClub.\n Initially, sales were on a pre-order basis only and took place in the\n\nbasement of a member\'s home.\n Due to interest and demand for good quality and reasonably priced\n\noutdoor gear, a store was opened and a small inventory carried.\n In 1974, the first Co-op catalogue with photos was produced, allowing\n\nthe creation of the Mail Order Store.\n Sales to institutions, such as parks and rescue groups, steadily\n\nincreased, giving rise to a separate Commercial Sales department.\n As the membership base continued to grow, the Board of Directors\n\napproved expansion into other retail outlets.\n In 1977, MEC opened a store in Calgary, and in 1985, another store in\n\nToronto.\n In the fall of 1992, we opened our fourth store in Ottawa.\n And most recently in the spring of 1995, we opened our largest\n\nlocation, which houses the Vancouver store, Mail Order and Commercial Sales.\n\n\n\n  In 1987, the Distribution centre moved to an independent site in\n\nRichmond, B.C.\n Although stores do receive occasional direct shipments from\n\nsuppliers, most of our products are distributed through the Distribution\n\nCentre.\n In 1990, our administrative offices moved from the Vancouver store\n\ninto the present location. \n\n  MEC today has over 700,000 members including more than 20,000\n\nmembers in other countries.\n Product lines have expanded and now include gear for hikers,\n\nclimbers, skiers, backpackers, cyclists, and paddlers. \n\n  Despite our rapid growth, MEC remains dedicated to our primary\n\ngoals, as stated in our Mission Statement. \n\n\n  Any person over the age of sixteen years may become a member of\n\nMEC by purchasing one share for &dollar;5.00.\n Only members may purchase or rent from MEC.\n\n\n  The benefits of membership are quality products, broad selection,\n\nlow prices, knowledgeable staff, reliable service, goods in stock, voting\n\nprivileges, influence over the organization, and participation in the\n\ndistribution of surplus. \n\n  Each member receives a membership card with a unique number.\n The member number must be presented to make a purchase in person, by\n\nmail, or by phone.\n A member is a part owner of MEC and as such, has the democratic\n\nright, and is encouraged to vote in the annual election of Directors. \n\n\n  An individual must own at least one share to be a member,\n\nand must be a member to purchase from any MEC store across Canada.\n Family and partners of members must have their own personal share to\n\npurchase from MEC. \n A share may be purchased at any store or through the Mail Order\n\nstore.\n The price of a share is always &dollar;5.00.\n Shares cannot be sold or traded, but represent a lifetime membership.\n\n\n  As a Co-operative, MEC does not seek to earn a profit.\n share money plus bank loans to buy what the\n\nmembers want at the lowest possible cost from world markets.\n We concentrate on good quality, and price the merchandise at the\n\nlowest reasonable level to offer good value and to cover our costs.\n We also provide knowledgeable well trained and experienced staff.\n\n\n\n  If MEC has a surplus at year end, it is because our sales volume\n\nhas been higher than we expected.\n Any surplus in a year is returned to the owners based on the amount\n\nof the individual member\'s purchases for the year.\n Purchases by each member are tracked through our computer.\n The distribution of surplus is actually made in the form of\n\nadditional patronage bonus shares in MEC, and the cash is retained to improve\n\nour service to members; i.e. by increasing level of inventory or improving\n\nstores.\n For example, if we had a surplus of 1% of sales in a given year, and\n\nif you had purchased &dollar;500.00 from MEC during that year, you would\n\nreceive a patronage bonus of &dollar;5.00, or one additional share.\n From time to time, when the Board believes that MEC has sufficient\n\ncapital to meet its future needs, some of these patronage bonus shares may be\n\nredeemed from members.\n In 1987, 1989, and 1993, a total of approximately &dollar;2 million\n\nworth of patronage bonus shares were redeemed.\n\n\n  A member can have more than one share by virtue of receiving\n\npatronage bonus shares; however, each member has only one vote, irrespective\n\nof the number of shares owned. \n QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR MEMBERSHIP & SHARES?\n\n\n  As part of our on-going commitment to better serve our members,\n\nMEC has created a MEMBERSHIP SERVICES DEPARTMENT which provides information\n\nand service concerning your membership.\n We are available to answer questions any member may have regarding\n\nhis or her membership such as: What is my member number?\n I\'ve got more than one member number, what are my options?\n\n We are at your service Monday - Friday 8am - 6pm Pacific Time.\n\n\n Call us or write directly to our head office in Vancouver.\n\n\n\n  When you move, please take a minute to keep us up-to-date on your\n\nnew address.\n Write to the Membership Services Department at Head Office, fill out\n\na " " Change of Address" " form at a store or call\n\nMembership Services at 1-800 474-7704.\n It is for your own benefit to provide your current address; if we\n\nhave your address on file, you will receive annual election packages and\n\ncatalogues ( see the following section).\n Also, we will be able to contact you if there are any updates\n\nconcerning an item you have purchased ( for example, an item that has been\n\nrecalled). \n\n\n  We publish catalogues twice yearly, in Spring and Fall, and send\n\nthem to members who have made a purchase any time in the past two years.\n\n\n  The catalogue contains valuable information on outdoor equipment\n\nand tips on choosing the most appropriate gear for various activities.\n lt also provides information from our Board of Directors and about\n\nordering by mail or phone.\n As we cannot list all available items in our catalogue, please\n\nenquire from the sales staff about items you need which are not listed.\n In any case, we encourage phone and mail order members to visit our\n\nstores to see what is new, whenever you are in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto,\n\nor Ottawa. \n\n\n  As a member, you are part owner of MEC, and the reason for our\n\nexistence; we welcome your input.\n We appreciate any suggestions, comments, or criticisms on products\n\nand service.\n Please use the suggestion boxes in each store or write directly to\n\nthe office in Vancouver.\n Members can obtain information such as audited financial statements,\n\nminutes of Annual General Meetings, and the Rules of MEC, from the Vancouver\n\noffice.\n You are urged to attend the Annual General Meetings, to vote in MEC\'s\n\nElection of Directors, and to consider running for the Board.\n Please look in the catalogue or enquire through the office for\n\ninformation on nominations. \n\n\n  MEC is governed by a Board of Directors.\n There are nine directors; each serves a three year term, and three\n\nare elected each year.\n The Board establishes the overall policy of MEC, and is ultimately\n\nresponsible for the operation of MEC.\n The Board of Directors meets about 10 times per year, and each\n\ndirector additionally serves on several committees, which also meet 3 to 10\n\ntimes per year.\n There are four Board officers ( President, Vice President, Secretary,\n\nTreasury).\n Each officer receives a token stipend for their additional duties\n\nwhile all Directors are reimbursed for expenses, and receive a small\n\nhonorarium for the time they spend preparing for and attending meetings. \n\n  Members 19 years and older, excluding employees, are eligible to\n\nbecome directors.\n Elections are held each spring and new directors commence their term\n\nat the Annual General Meeting in April.\n Persons wishing to serve must be nominated by at least five other\n\nmembers.\n Nominations close in October of each year.\n More information is available in our catalogue.\n\n\n\n  Mountain Equipment Co-op believes that in addition to providing\n\ngoods and services, we should help preserve the quality of the environment,\n\nand educate our members and the public about environmentally responsible use\n\nof the outdoors. \n\n  The recreational activities of our members, and thus MEC\'s\n\nexistence, are dependent on the preservation and wise management of outdoor\n\nareas which have important wilderness or recreational value.\n We want to ensure that the environment in which our merchandise is\n\nused, is preserved.\n To this end, our members have directed us to ensure that a\n\nsignificant amount of our advertising and promotional activities are devoted\n\nto sponsoring and promoting environmental projects in the areas our members\n\nuse for recreation. \n\n  Following this direction, we established the MEC Endowment Fund\n\nfor the Environment in 1993 as a vehicle to accept charitable contributions\n\nfrom the public for environmental preservation. \n\n  Our business procedures are constantly assessed.\n We routinely recycle as much as possible; we use recycled paper,\n\nseek to reduce packaging waste, and endeavour to minimize the environmental\n\nimpact of our commercial activities. \n\n\n  The Canadian dollar has faced unprecedented fluctuations on\n\nworld currency markets over the past two years.\n The price of much of our merchandise is affected by the value of the\n\nCanadian dollar.\n We will make every effort to hold our retail prices throughout the\n\nlife of each catalogue.\n However, our\n#1 priority is to ensure the long term fiscal health of your co-operative.\n Consequently we may have to adjust some prices in season to meet\n\nthis priority. \n\n  We do not guarantee the lowest price in town on any specific\n\nitem at any particular time, but we are committed to providing our members\n\nwith the best overall value for their money year in and year out. \n\n\n  Our buyers shop the world for the best selection of MEC\n\nproducts.\n They make the initial decisions, within the policy guidelines set by\n\nthe Board, as to which items go into MEC stores and the catalogue.\n By their purchases and comments, MEMBERS DECIDE which items CONTINUE\n\nto be stocked and catalogued. \n\n  Decisions to include items in the catalogue are made by the\n\nbuyers, STRICTLY on the basis of which items are most appropriate.\n This approach ensures the best and most informative catalogue for\n\nour members at the lowest cost, and is what differentiates us from most other\n\ncatalogue retailers. \n\n\n  We guarantee sound advice from our sales staff.\n We devote a great deal of effort to product knowledge training, and\n\nsales staff can increase their earnings by successfully completing a series\n\nof training programs.\n You will receive honest recommendations of products suitable to your\n\nneeds.\n Our staff are paid salaries, not commissions, and are active users\n\nof the products we offer.\n\n\n  Furthermore, each store is connected to a database of detailed\n\nproduct specifications and usage information.\n\n\n  We strive for quality, not quantity, in our service.\n If you need detailed advice, we can provide it.\n Please note: we can provide advice sooner during off-peak times in\n\nthe stores. \n\n\n  Mountain Equipment\n\nCo-operative\n August 2, 1971 ( British\n\nColumbia)\n\n\nVancouver, British ColumbiaCanada V6J 1K1 \n\n 5.

{'text': '( Labour\n\nStandards)  \n\n\n  ( Labour Standards)\n\nand accompanying Regulations apply to employees and employers in works,\n\nundertakings, or businesses under the legislative authority of the Parliament\n\nof Canada. \n\n  Broadly speaking, the activities that come within federal\n\njurisdiction include:&bullet; Interprovincial and international services\n\nsuch as- railways; - highway transport; - telephone, telegraph, and\n\ncable systems; - pipelines; - canals; - ferries, tunnels, and bridges; -\n\nshipping and shipping services; &bullet; Radio and television broadcasting,\n\nincluding cablevision; &bullet; Air transport, aircraft operations, and\n\naerodromes; &bullet; Banks; &bullet; Undertakings for the protection and\n\npreservation of fisheries as a natural resource; &bullet; Undertakings\n\ndeclared by Parliament to be for the general advantage of Canada such as <l>\n\n- most grain elevators; - flour and seed mills, feed warehouses and\n\ngrain-seed cleaning plants; - uranium mining and processing; - certain\n\nindividual undertakings such as Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company. \n\n  Most federal Crown corporations, such as the Canada Mortgage and\n\nHousing Corporation and Canada Post Corporation, are covered while federal\n\npublic service employees are not.\n The Government of Canada has stated, however, that the minimum\n\nstandards of the Code will be met in the public service as a matter of\n\npolicy. \n\n  This is a general outline of the undertakings subject to Part III\n\nof the  Canada Labour Code  .\n If you are employed in or operate an undertaking other than described\n\nabove, you should contact your provincial or territorial labour department\n\nfor information relating to labour standards. \n\n\n  The hours-of-work provisions of the Code do not apply to\n\nemployees who are managers or superintendents or who exercise management\n\nfunctions or to members of architectural, dental, engineering, legal, or\n\nmedical professions.\n Managers are also excluded from coverage under the unjust dismissal\n\nprovisions. \n\n\n  The Code makes no distinction between full-time and part-time or\n\ncasual employees.\n All are covered by its provisions if they meet the qualifying\n\nrequirements. \n\n\n  Canada Labour Code\n\n is to establish and protect the work place  right to\n\nfair and equitable conditions of employment. \n\n  Following are brief descriptions of the minimum standards\n\nprovided by the Code.\n For further detail, please refer to the pamphlets on individual\n\nstandards listed below. \n\n  The Code provisions are minimum standards only and in no way\n\ninterfere with more favourable rights or benefits established by collective\n\nagreement, private arrangement or employer policy.\n Further, unionized undertakings are exempt from the divisions of the\n\nCode dealing with minimum wages, annual vacations, general holidays and\n\nbereavement leave where the collective agreement provides rights and benefits\n\nas favourable or better than those in the Code in respect of length of leave,\n\nrates of pay and qualifying periods; and, the collective agreement provides\n\nfor the settlement of disputes by a third party. \n\n\n  Standard hours are 8 in a day and 40 in a week.\n At least one and one-half times the regular rate of pay must be paid\n\nfor hours worked in excess of standard hours.\n Maximum hours are 48 in a week.\n Certain provisions permit flexibility in applying these standards.\n As well, special regulations cover certain classes of workers in\n\nspecific industries such as, for example, city and highway transport drivers.\n\n\n\n\n  Minimum wage rates are explained in pamphlet 2 of this series,\n\navailable from any Human Resources Development Canada ( Labour Program)\n\noffice.\n These rates are subject to revision from time to time by\n\norder-in-council. \n\n\n  An employee is entitled to at least 2 weeks vacation annually\n\nwith vacation pay of not less than 4 per cent of gross wages.\n After 6 consecutive years of employment with one employer, an\n\nemployee is entitled to 3 weeks vacation with pay, equivalent to 6 per cent\n\nof gross earnings. \n\n  Vacation must be granted not later than 10 months after\n\ncompletion of the year entitling the employee to the vacation.\n Any outstanding vacation pay must be paid on termination of\n\nemployment. \n\n\n  Employees are entitled to nine holidays with pay each year: New\n\nYear\'s Day, Good Friday, Victoria Day, Canada Day, Labour Day, Thanksgiving\n\nDay, Remembrance Day, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day. \n\n  Provision is made for the substitution of other holidays where so\n\ndesignated in collective agreements or where the employer and at least 70 per\n\ncent of employees agree to the substitution.\n When an employee, who would have been entitled to a general holiday\n\nwith pay, is required to work on a general holiday, the employee will be\n\npaid, in addition to his regular rate of wages for that day, at a rate at\n\nleast equal to one and one-half times his regular rate of wages for the time\n\nthe employee worked on that day.\n Special provisions apply to workers in " continuous operations" and\n\nto managerial and professional employees ( see pamphlet 4 in this series).\n\n\n Maternity-Related Reassignment and Leave, Maternity Leave\n\nand Parental Leave  \n\n  An employee who is pregnant or nursing may request that the\n\nemployer temporarily modify her job duties or reassign her to another job,\n\nwhere reasonably practicable, if continuing any of her current duties may\n\npose a risk to her health or that of the f&oeligature;tus or child.\n A physician\'s certificate indicating how long the risk is likely to\n\nlast and what activities or conditions should be avoided, is required. \n\n  An employee who has worked for the same employer for at least 6\n\nmonths is entitled to up to 17 weeks of maternity leave to have her child.\n The employer may not compel an employee to take leave unless she is\n\nunable to perform an essential function of her job and no appropriate\n\nalternative job is available. \n\n  An additional leave of up to 24 weeks is available to natural or\n\nadoptive parents each of whom have worked for the same employer for at least\n\n6 months and have or will have care and custody of a child.\n If both parents work for federally regulated employers, their\n\ncombined leave cannot exceed 24 weeks. \n\n  An employer may not dismiss, suspend, lay off, demote, or\n\ndiscipline an employee because she is pregnant or has applied for leave.\n Pregnancy or intention to take related leave cannot affect an\n\nemployer\'s decision to train or promote her. \n\n  Upon their written request, employees on leave are entitled to be\n\ninformed of any employment, promotion, or training opportunities for which\n\nthey are qualified. \n\n  The Code also provides that seniority continue and pension,\n\nhealth, and disability plans remain in force during leave, provided the\n\nemployee pays normally required contributions.\n The employer must continue payments to such plans in at least the\n\nsame proportion as if the employee were at work.\n If there is an income replacement or insurance plan in force at the\n\nwork place, an employee on leave is entitled to benefits on the same terms as\n\nany employee absent from work for health-related reasons. \n\n  Upon return from leave, the employee must be reinstated in his or\n\nher position or be given a comparable position in the same work place with\n\nthe same wages and benefits.\n However, an employee\'s wages and benefits may be affected if, during\n\nthe leave, the wages and benefits of the employee\'s group are changed as part\n\nof a plan to reorganize the work place. \n\n  For further details and conditions concerning parental leave, see\n\npamphlet 5 of this series. \n\n\n  Employers are required to give individual employees two weeks\n\nwritten notice of termination, or two  pay in lieu of notice,\n\nexcept where the employee is dismissed for just cause.\n Employees must have been continuously employed for at least three\n\nmonths to qualify for notice or pay in lieu. \n\n  If an employer intends to terminate the employment of 50 or more\n\nemployees in an industrial establishment within any 4-week period, at least\n\n16 weeks advance notice must be given in writing to the Minister of Labour,\n\nthe Canada Employment and Immigration Commission, and any trade union\n\nrecognized as the bargaining agent for affected employees. \n\n  Where there is no bargaining agent, notice must be given directly\n\nto the employees. \n\n  In addition, an employer who gives notice of a group termination\n\nis required to establish a committee of employer and employee representatives\n\nfor the purposes of developing an adjustment plan to reduce the impact of the\n\ntermination upon the affected employees. \n\n\n  Employees with at least 12 consecutive months of service are\n\nentitled to severance pay on termination, except in cases of dismissal for\n\njust cause.\n pay\n\nfor each completed year of service or five  pay. \n\n\n  Employers are required to pay employees on the regular pay-day as\n\nestablished by the employer\'s practice and to pay any wages or other amounts\n\nsuch as overtime pay, holiday pay, severance pay, or bereavement pay within\n\n30 days of entitlement. \n\n\n  The Code provides an administrative procedure for collecting\n\nunpaid wages and other benefits.\n If an employer has not paid an employee wages or other amounts to\n\nwhich the employee is entitled, a written payment order may be issued by a\n\nfederal inspector to the employer or, under certain circumstances, to a\n\ndirector of the corporation, ordering payment of the amount in question.\n A person affected by a payment order may appeal to the Minister, in\n\nwriting, within 15 days after service of the order.\n An employer or director may file an appeal only if the amount\n\nindicated in the payment order is paid to the Minister.\n Should the federal inspector conclude that the employee\'s complaint\n\nis without merit, a notice of unfounded complaint is issued.\n The employee may appeal to the Minister in writing within 15 days\n\nafter service of the notice. \n\n\n  An employee may not be disciplined because garnishment\n\nproceedings may be or have been taken against him or her. \n\n\n  An employer may not make deductions from wages or other amounts\n\ndue to an employee unless the deduction is required by federal or provincial\n\nlaw, authorized by a court order or collective agreement, or where the\n\ndeduction is related to amounts authorized in writing by an employee, or\n\noverpayment of wages by the employer.\n An employer may not make deductions in respect of damage to property\n\nor loss of money or property if any person other than the employee had access\n\nto the property or money in question. \n\n\n  An employee who has 3 or more months of continuous employment may\n\nnot be disciplined, demoted, laid off, suspended, or dismissed because of\n\nabsence due to illness or injury, provided the absence does not exceed 12\n\nweeks and the employee, if requested in writing by the employer, provides the\n\nemployer with a doctor\'s certificate certifying that the employee was not\n\nable to work during that period.\n Seniority accumulates and pension and benefit plans continue in force\n\nduring the absence provided the employee pays any normally required\n\ncontributions.\n The employer is not required to continue wage payments during sick\n\nleave but must maintain contributions to health and disability benefit plans\n\nin at least the same proportion as if the employee were at work. \n\n\n  Employees are protected from dismissal, suspension, lay-off,\n\ndemotion, or discipline because of absence from work due to work-related\n\nillness or injury.\n During such absences, employees are entitled to wage replacement,\n\npayable at an equivalent rate to that provided for under applicable  compensation legislation in the employee\'s province of\n\npermanent residence. \n\n\n  All employees are entitled to bereavement leave on any normal\n\nworking day that occurs during the three days immediately following the death\n\nof a member of their immediate family.\n Employees with three or more months of service are entitled to be\n\npaid for such leave days. \n\n\n  After 12 consecutive months of employment, employees who are not\n\nmanagers or subject to a collective agreement and believe they have been\n\nunjustly dismissed may lodge a written complaint of unjust dismissal with the\n\ndepartment.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd25c67f6-8445-4707-b145-caf09aa49c3f', 'added':

{'text': 'When you come right down to it, caribou aren\'t sexy.\n\n\n \n\n  Late last August, we went to see the caribou as they threaded\n\ntheir way south from summer\'s coastal feeding grounds to more pro <l>\n\ntected areas for the winter.\n It was mid-migration, and that gave us a chance to watch nature\'s\n\ncycles at work. \n\n  Late August is the peak of autumn in the Arctic.\n Golden dwarf willows and ruby red scrub fill folds of the wrinkled\n\nland so that from the air, it looks like paint trickling between the\n\nmountains.\n The colours are so strongly separated \x97 grey streaked by red streaked\n\nby yellow \x97 that it looks like a giant paint-by-numbers canvas.\n We soon learned the colour code: yellow willows like their roots\n\nsoaked in water and birch ( red) don\'t.\n So when you want high, dry ground, yellow is bad, red is good and\n\nbrown ( bare dirt) is best. \n\n  Our camp was in an idyllic setting of gold-tinged, rolling hills\n\nbordered by high mountain spines that forced the caribou down to the lake\n\nwater \x97 and past our tents. \n\n  No sooner had we stowed our gear than a bull came over the\n\nnearest ridge and strolled towards us.\n He was magnificent, with thick, dark hair, a white chest and a huge\n\nrack.\n He walked slowly, seemingly oblivious to our presence, and came\n\nwithin metres of our tents.\n The rest of the week, most of the caribou kept a wide buffer between\n\nus and them.\n But beyond a certain distance, about 100 m, we seemed invisible to\n\nthem. \n\n  an Inuk friend\n\nonce told us, just before he shot one.\n\n\n\n\n  But caribou aren\'t dumb.\n Rifles just weren\'t part of their evolutionary game-plan, explains\n\ncaribou research biologist Ken Whitten. \n\n  " For a man with a rifle, a caribou seems incredibly\n\nstupid because it will run right up to you \x97 almost.\n They\'ll sometimes approach an object to get its scent, to confirm\n\nwhat it is.\n\n\n  " They evolved to cope with wolves and bears, which\n\nthey can easily outrun.\n So they don\'t need much of a head-start.\n But they haven\'t had much time to adapt to snow machines, motorboats\n\nand high-powered rifles."   \n\n  For three days, we had been teased by the caribou.\n Except for that first bull at camp, the rest had kept their distance\n\n\x97 within binocular range but not quite in comfortable camera range.\n So we decided to just go hiking.\n\n\n  One veered towards the water but the other, a collection of\n\nbulls, came straight for us.\n Three of them were huge, with thick white chests and massive antlers.\n\n\n\n  They came closer and closer until they were hardly 50 metres from\n\nus.\n The lead male lifted his head, but when we fired our cameras, he just\n\nstared.\n We stared back, for maybe 30 seconds.\n\n\n  From this close, we could really see how rich their coats looked.\n Fall hair is best for making clothing.\n Hide from the upper leg is used for boots, socks and mitts.\n The muzzle makes good boot soles, and the rest of the skin is used\n\nfor pants and parkas. \n\n  Now a grazing herd came over the horizon and munched its way\n\ntowards our small lake.\n As they got closer, we could hear a curious, rhythmic clicking sound,\n\nlike rocks banging together.\n Caribou have large, concave hooves that spread with each step,\n\ncreating better footing on all types of ground.\n The noise comes from ligaments snapping the hoof segments back\n\ntogether as each leg is lifted. \n\n  The caribou spend all summer eating, when they\'re not being\n\nchased by insects.\n Fast growing early summer plants, high in protein, are used to fuel\n\ngrowing antlers, which both males and females replace yearly. \n\n  Fall meat is preferred, as well.\n Until the rut, hunters favour males because they have the thickest\n\nfat.\n An average bull is 180 kilograms, twice the size of a cow.\n Then, as rut nears, the big bulls start to urinate on their hind legs\n\nand rub that against other parts of their bodies.\n It all has to do with hormones, and the end result is strong-tasting\n\nmeat for a couple of months. \n\n  Within 10 minutes, the cows and calves were drinking.\n The bulls, carrying large racks still covered in velvet, hung back.\n\n\n\n  The animals we were seeing were just a thin line in what is\n\nactually a 320 kilometre front of caribou moving through the mountain passes.\n\n\n\n  There are three herds of caribou in Alaska: the Western Arctic,\n\nCentral Arctic and Porcupine Herds.\n The Western Herd ambles yearly from the north side of the Brooks\n\nRange to the south.\n These days, Whitten says, their major wintering areas are far south\n\nof what was used even a decade ago.\n " As far south as the Yukon River and west towards the\n\ncoast and even reaching the coast in some places."   \n\n  That\'s because the Western Arctic herd has exploded in size\n\nduring the last two decades.\n The herd reached a low of 75,000 animals in 1977, probably because of\n\nunusually deep snow and large populations of predators, but also because\n\nof large harvests by humans.\n " There was no closed season and no bag limit on that herd in\n\nthe early 70s, and commercial sale of caribou meat was allowed," \n\nWhitten says.\n " There were probably 25,000 animals harvested each\n\nyear.\n But it wasn\'t until our people went up and did an aerial census that\n\nwe found the numbers had declined so drastically."   \n\n  Predators also declined ( many starved because they couldn\'t find\n\ncaribou).\n Bag limits came back, winters were less severe, and the herd\n\nexploded, increasing by 20 per cent per year. \n\n  Radical fluctuations like this seem to be natural,\n\nbiologists agree.\n Historical records only go back to the 1800s but even then, the\n\nnumbers yo-yoed, dropping drastically in the 1880s, rebounding big by the\n\n1920s and 30s. \n\n  However, there\'s no way of knowing what could happen if their\n\ncalving grounds were invaded, as those of the Porcupine herd might very well\n\nbe.    \n\n\n\n BY JUDY LANGFORD\n\n  Two things set the Artic Winter Games apart from most other\n\nsports competitions - weather and attitude. \n\n  During the NWT playdowns for this year\x92s Games, the temperature\n\nhit minus 45&degree; Celsius.\n " It\'s so cold, the gunpowder doesn\x92t burn properly,"\n\n groaned a silhouette shooter just in from the deepfreeze.\n " You\'re never sure where your shots are going to go."\n\n  \n\n  "\n\nIs your hat on fire?"  \n\n  " No.\n\n\n  hats, scarves and beards were caked\n\nwith ice.\n Their hands were so stiff they could barely reload their weapons.\n In fact, the temperature was considered too cold for Snowshoe\n\nBiathlon.\n But the rulebook has provisions for such extremes.\n At Hay River, in a sort of virtual biathlon, the athletes ran in\n\nplace in a gymnasium, then ducked outside to shoot targets. \n\n  The dog mushers delayed their competition by one day, partly due\n\nto the cold and because bad weather had delayed a team flying in from the\n\nEastern Arctic.\n\n\n  Niko Inuaraq, a juvenile-class racer from Pond Inlet, wore\n\ntraditional caribou and seal-skin to race his family\'s team.\n The sturdy work dogs are built for endurance, not sprinting, but\n\nspectators were delighted by the " real dogs." \n\n  The team ran in a traditional Inuit fan hitch, pulling Niko on a\n\nkomatik, a flat sled that resembles a wooden pallet with runners.\n Niko\'s father, Charlie Inuaraq, stood immobile in his caribou parka\n\nfor the 20 minutes it took Niko to complete the course.\n He said nothing, his eyes never leaving the horizon, waiting for his\n\nson to reappear out of the ice-fog.\n The tough High Arctic dogs were actually too hot after running in the\n\nsubzero cold.\n photograph\n\n \n\n  Athletes and spectators both fared better at indoor sports.\n Competition often took on a neighbourhood party feeling, as children\n\nbarely tall enough to touch the net took over the volleyball courts\n\nbetween games.\n A couple bounced a ball back and forth with their heads.\n A player sat calmly breastfeeding her little boy as the rest of her\n\nteam warmed up.\n Spectators ringed the gymnasium, ducking when the ball came\n\ntheir way. \n\n  Panda, a black Labrador retriever who came to Yellowknife with\n\nthe Inuvik indoor soccer teams, didn\'t seem to care that she was interrupting\n\nwarmups as she padded around the St. Patrick\'s High School gym. \n\n  The AWG playdowns were refreshingly free of cutthroat\n\ncompetition.\n Players wanted to win, but they wanted to have fun, too.\n At the arena, young hockey players took advantage of a coin-operated\n\nskate sharpener to put a fresh edge on their blades \x97 then skated on the\n\ngritty snow in the parking lot, laughing all the way. \n\n  Kids will be kids.\n When a couple of Bantam players stepped outside for a cigarette\n\nbetween games, a passing adult glared at them.\n\n\n  The boys seemed puzzled.\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n BY KAREN LAJOIE\n\n  It\'s mid-January and the air in Yellowknife is searing cold.\n Inside Gerry Murphy Arena, it\'s a little less so.\n Shouts echo over the thump of puck on boards as masked, hugely\n\npadded players circle and sprint on the smooth ice.\n They float in patterns from end to end, in the familiar rituals of\n\nthe National Game. \n\n  There\'s a slight difference from what you see on TV every\n\nSaturday night, though: all the players scrapping it out today are women.\n And among them is one of the most remarkable athletes at the 1996\n\nArctic Winter Games. \n\n  Goaltender Robin Sproule has competed for the Northwest\n\nTerritories in no fewer than 11 straight Arctic Winter games.\n She\'s 32 years old, a battered veteran in a game that\'s played\n\nmostly by the vigorous young. \n\n  As a child, Robin practiced figure-skating on the ice at Gerry\n\nMurphy Arena and won medals in the sport during in her early AWG years.\n In 1996, 21 years later, she returned to the same sheet of ice to\n\ntry out for the women\'s hockey team and another trip to Alaska wearing\n\nthe NWT\'s colours.\n\n\n  Hockey is the defining passion of Robin\'s life.\n In order to play, she\'s had to stickhandle her way around\n\nconventional wisdom like a forward threading towards the net. \n\n  In her time, the diminutive goaltender has been the only girl in\n\na  league, and the only woman in a men\'s league.\n Facing 220 pounds of onrushing sharpshooter, she stood her ground,\n\nfocused solely on keeping the puck out of the net. \n\n  Now Robin Sproule is challenging conventional wisdom again.\n\n\n  After three arthroscopic surgeries, her right knee is held\n\ntogether by three overlapping braces during practice and games.\n But bum knee or no bum knee, Robin plans to go all out to earn yet\n\nanother medal. \n\n  That single-mindedness appeared early on, when the 16-year-old\n\nfirst tried out for the Yellowknife  Midget team in 1979.\n\n\n\n  Coach Dave Grundy ( Staff-Sergeant Grundy of the Yellowknife\n\nRCMP) selected the young goalie for her ability and desire, not her gender.\n\n \n\n  " There was a lot of adversity for a woman playing at\n\nthe level,"  he recalls.\n " Other teams would deliberately crash the net, trying\n\nto scare her.\n\n\n  If she had lived down South, Grundy thinks, Robin Sproule would\n\nhave played on Canada\x92s national women\x92s team.\n " With the right coaching, she could have been national\n\ncaliber,"  he says.\n " I\'ve seen those women play, and she\'s every bit as\n\ngood.\n\n\n  " Even in tryouts, Robin is\n\nalways the first person in the dressing room."  \n\n  That habit may be part of a necessary psychological\n\nbuildup.\n says Fell.\n " She starts doubting her abilities.\n She\'s pretty intense, but she plays better after she gets all\n\npumped up."   \n\n  Sports have always been central in the lives of both Robin\n\nSproule and her sister, Sidney.\n They started figure-skating as toddlers, but Sidney moved on to\n\nswimming, while Robin preferred the slick, cool speed of ice sports.\n\n\n\n  Figure-skating took Sproule to her first Arctic Winter\n\nGames in Schefferville, Quebec in 1976.\n At the time, Robin was the youngest competitor, known as " the\n\nwalking parka" because she was so small, her size 10 team uniform hung to her\n\nankles.\n\n\n  Two years later, Robin again took the gold in Hay River.\n But she soon dropped out of figure-skating competition.\n " The North wasn\'t competitive enough, and it was getting\n\ntoo expensive for my folks, sending me to summer school in Calgary every\n\nyear.\n\n\n  In high schol, she took up team sports like volleyball and\n\nbasketball, twice earning the title of female athlete of the year.\n Basketball and volleyball also took her to three more Arctic Winter\n\nGames and brought her an armload of medals.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '41d46016-7a21-4e86-8f31-35ac0c36cd33', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.898528+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': 'by W. Bradford Swift, D.V.M.\n YOUR DOG\'S WELL-BEING DEPENDS ON YOUR ONGOING INVOLVEMENT.\n\n \n\n  We\'ve all heard the old adage in its many different forms:\n\n " As long as you have your health, you have everything."\n\n\n While it may be a little overstated, it does stress the importance of\n\ngood health, and it\'s just as important for our canine friends as it is for\n\nus.\n Continued good health doesn\'t happen by accident.\n Maintaining your pet\'s health takes a little time, money and\n\neffort, but it certainly beats the alternative. \n\n  It\'s never too early or too late to start paying attention to your\n\npet\'s health.\n If you don\'t have a dog yet, but are planning on adding one to your\n\nfamily, now is a perfect time to begin learning what you can do to help\n\nensure your frisky friend stays in the pink.\n\n\npanion is a \'senior citizen,\' it\'s still important to have an eye on\n\nhealth. \n\n\n  Attention to good health begins as you decide what breed of dog\n\nbest fits your needs.\n The idea is to select from those breeds that most closely fit your\n\nneeds and your lifestyle. \n\n  As you investigate your choices, find out if the breeds you are\n\ninterested in are pre-disposed to any health problems such as hip dys <l>\n\nplasia or congenital heart disease.\n While this may not rule out the breed, you will want to pay special\n\nattention to these concerns. \n\n\n  While you are narrowing down the possibilities, there\'s\n\nanother important decision to make.\n Who will be your dog\'s veterinarian?\n He or she will be the second most important person in your dog\'s\n\nlife.\n Over the course of the average life span of a dog, the two of you\n\nwill pay numerous visits to his or her office, especially in the first\n\nyear.\n you bring\n\nyour pup home - if there\'s an emergency situation early on, you won\'t waste\n\nprecious time scrambling for medical help at the last minute. \n\n  Unfortunately, many new pet owners select their veterinarian\n\nbased on only one factor - location.\n While location should be added into the equation, it should not be\n\nthe sole basis from which you establish such an important relationship.\n It would be like marrying the guy or girl next door simply because it\n\nwas convenient. \n\n  There are at least four factors to weigh in determining the\n\nveterinarian for you: services offered, cost, personality and location.\n Today, there is a wide range of services that may be offered by\n\nyour veterinarian, from the full-service, total-care complex that\n\nincludes not only veterinary care but also grooming, boarding and pet\n\nsupplies to the specialty practices that, in some cases, see only pets with\n\nspecial problems.\n What services are most important to you?\n Often, the more services offered, the larger the facility will be and\n\nthe less personal the care. \n\n  The cost of the care offered is also a consideration.\n Some pet owners are on a tight budget and are looking for the type of\n\ncare that fits in those budgets.\n Other families have more flexibility and want the very best care, no\n\nmatter how much it costs.\n Especially if you live in a metropolitan area or don\'t mind\n\ndriving a little further, you can find an animal hospital to fit your needs.\n\n\n\n  Personality is another important factor to consider.\n Remember, it is likely you will see your veterinarian fairly often.\n Why not have it be a pleasant occasion?\n Most people are interested in a facility with a warm, friendly\n\nand professional atmosphere.\n Are the facilities clean and well organized?\n Do you get a sense that the people are interested in what they\n\nare doing and care about their patients and clients?\n\n\n  While location may not be the most important factor, it\n\nshouldn\'t be ignored.\n Remember, your pet may need care in the middle of the night, or\n\non short notice, for some sudden illness or an emergency.\n It might not be in your pet\'s interest if your veterinarian is\n\nan hour\'s drive away.  \n\n  With these four factors in mind, write out a list, starting with\n\nthe most important considerations.\n Now you are ready to find the veterinary hospital to fit your\n\nneeds.\n\n\nrals, yellow pages and visitation.\n Start by asking your friends and neighbours who have pets where they\n\ngo, whether they are satisfied, and why.\n As they are talking, remember to listen for those factors you de\n\n<l> cided were most important.\n You can then use the yellow pages for further general information, as\n\nwell as making a few preliminary phone calls to those hospitals that are\n\nlikely candidates.\n Remember to not only listen for the answers to questions you pose the\n\nstaff, but also how the person is answering them.\n Is he or she cordial and understanding, or short and snappy?\n Can you understand what is said, or are there so many medical terms\n\nused it sounds like a foreign language? \n\n  Through these calls, you should be able to narrow your choices\n\ndown to two or three possibilities.\n Even if you think you\'ve narrowed it down to one, don\'t make a final\n\ndecision until you have visited the facilities, preferably without your pet.\n While making the initial phone calls, if you find a hospital that\n\nseems to fit your needs, ask them if you could take a short tour of the\n\nfacility. \n\n\n  Since the best age to bring a new puppy into your home is when he\n\nis from eight to 12 weeks of age, this will be the time of your first visit\n\ntogether to your veterinarian, even if your pup is up to date with all\n\nhis vaccinations and deworming. \n\n  It\'s a good idea to have your puppy given a thorough physical\n\nexamination by your veterinarian before you agree to keep him.\n In this way, you can avoid owning a puppy that may end up having\n\ncongenital problems, which may be more serious and involve more\n\nextensive care than you are prepared for.\n Although a physical exam may not detect every potential problem, it\n\nwill screen out most of them.  \n\n  Be sure to take your puppy\'s full set of records, which will\n\nindicate which vaccinations and parasite exams and treatments have\n\nalready been performed.\n This will save you both time and money.\n Your veterinarian will then be able to continue this important\n\nhealth care regime until your puppy is fully immunized and free of worms and\n\nother pesky parasites. \n\n  The canine diseases your puppy should be vaccinated against are\n\ncanine distemper, parvovirus, hepatitis, leptospirosis and rabies.\n Other diseases that can be prevented by vaccinations are\n\ntraceobronchitis and Lyme disease.\n Check with your veterinarian to see if these diseases are a\n\nconcern in your area. \n\n  Annual routine examinations are then recommended; your dog\'s\n\nimmunity will be maintained with yearly booster shots.\n Depending on the vaccination used, rabies vaccinations may be given\n\nevery three years.\n Always be sure these immunizations are kept current,\n\nparticularly if your dog is going to be boarded. \n\n  It is also important to have your dog protected from heartworm.\n If your puppy is less than six months old, he may be started directly\n\non heartworm preventive medication.\n If he is older, your veterinarian may recommend a blood test, to\n\nbe sure he is not already harbouring the parasite, and then place him on\n\nmedication.\n\n\n  The puppy visits for vaccinations and worming will usually end\n\nwhen he is four to six months of age.\n The next visit should be for neutering.\n The age at which this procedure is performed depends on whether\n\nyou have a male or female dog, and the preference of the veterinarian. \n\n  Most veterinarians agree the best age to have a female spayed is\n\nfive to six months.\n Spaying then greatly reduces the risk of her getting mammary tumours\n\nlater in life.\n The longer you wait after this period, the greater the chance of\n\nmammary cancer developing. \n\n  Male dogs will generally be neutered at around nine to 12 months\n\nof age.\n Again, neutering during this time reduces the chance of prostate\n\nproblems later in life, and helps control the pet overpopulation problems\n\nthat continue to exist. \n\n  Your dog will also need to visit the vet when an illness or\n\ninjury occurs.\n Such visits can be greatly reduced by maintaining good health\n\npractices at home and by taking advantage of the many preventive medical\n\npractices now available.  \n\n\n  Keeping your dog in the best of health continues at home with a\n\nsound nutritional program, adequate shelter, good grooming and the\n\nproper amount of attention and activity. \n\n  One of the first and most-often-asked questions new dog owners\n\nhave is, " What should my dog or puppy eat?"\n Your local grocery store may present a selection almost as great\n\nas the number of breeds from which you had to choose.\n Which of these do you feed?\n\n\n  The first nutrition rule is " dog food for dogs, people food for\n\npeople."\n Although an occasional treat from the table isn\'t likely to harm your\n\ndog, you must be careful.\n Some dogs enticed with table scraps will hold out for more leftover\n\nsteak in favour of their regular food.\n The best approach, especially in the early going, is to feed dog\n\nfood exclusively. \n\n  " you get\n\nwhat you pay for." \n In other words, bargain brands aren\'t really bargains.\n The less expensive dog foods are cheaper because they have more\n\nfillers in them, which means your dog will have to eat more to meet his\n\nnutritional needs, resulting in more stools to clean up.\n Stick with the top brands - ideally, one of the brands that your\n\ndog\'s breeder or your veterinarian recommends. \n\n  It\'s also a good idea to feed one of the name-brand foods that\n\nfits the age and \'lifestyle\' of your dog.\n Start your youngster on one of the higher calorie puppy foods\n\nbalanced for the rapid growth a puppy experiences.\n If your grown dog is very active, feed one of the foods that are\n\nslightly higher in protein; your older, more sedentary dog should\n\nbe fed a senior diet lower in calories. \n\n  Another important nutritional need is fresh water.\n Be sure your pet always has an ample supply of clean water that is\n\nchanged often - at least once per day.\n It is not a good idea to try to limit the number of times your puppy\n\nwets on the carpet by reducing the amount of water you give. \n\n  While talking about nutrition, let\'s not forget another\n\nimportant aspect of your pup\'s health: his teeth.\n Yes, dogs need dental care much like their owners.\n Unfortunately, dogs aren\'t able to care for their teeth without\n\nsome help from us.\n It\'s important to start a home dental program early, even\n\nbefore the puppy really needs it, so he can get used to the regimen.\n Start by getting your pup accustomed to having your hands around his\n\nface and mouth without him nipping at you.\n Then, move up to some light brushing using a finger wrapped in gauze\n\nor a soft toothbrush.\n These early brushings should be short and light, increasing in time\n\nand \'seriousness.\' \n\n  Once your dog is accustomed to this process, be sure to brush\n\nhis teeth frequently, at least two to three times per week.\n It\'s fine to supplement the brushing with an occasional dog biscuit\n\nand chew toys, but don\'t depend on them to do the job alone.\n They won\'t.\n Regular brushing will greatly increase the times between dental\n\ncleanings by your veterinarian - although, just as with our own teeth, even\n\n<l> tually the plaque will need to be professionally removed. \n\n  There are several products now on the market that can be used to\n\nhelp you keep your pet\'s teeth in good shape, including special brushes,\n\nsprays and pastes.\n Check with your veterinarian for these, and be sure your vet\n\nperforms a dental exam as part of your pet\'s annual checkup.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5982220d-90da-4c0c-b5d2-274ad18ed2d2',

{'text': 'A bird\'s-eye view of what it takes to build the perfect birdhouse\n\n\n\n\n  Of the many changes that have taken place in Canadian society\n\nin the last three or four decades, none is greater than the way we view\n\nbirds.\n Even 20 years ago, people who watched wild birds or cared for\n\nthem were regarded with mild suspicion by much of the rest of the popu\n\n<l> lation.\n They were considered to be odd n some way.\n Now the tables have turned.\n It is the people who don\'t notice birds or who are insensitive to\n\ntheir continued flourishing that are considered to be the odd ones out. \n\n  Nowhere is the concern for the well-being of birds more in\n\nevidence than among gardeners who, although gentle and thoughtful folk\n\nin the main, sometimes have their patience tested by the birds in their own\n\nbackyards.\n Fortunately, most have discovered that the mixed blessing of birds\n\nnear a garden can be biased in the gardener\'s favour by encouraging some\n\nbirds to nest close to the garden while encouraging others to nest fur <l>\n\nther away. \n\n  Whether or not you happen to be a gardener, improving the environ\n\n<l> ment for birds is always a satisfying activity.\n One of the easiest ways to do this is to offer them safe, suitable\n\nnesting boxes. \n\n  The first thing to remember when building a birdhouse is that\n\nbirdhouses are intended for the enjoyment of birds and not people.\n This dictates that your primary consideration when drawing up the\n\nplans should be the suitability of the house for its inhabitants.\n In other words, personal aesthetic considerations should take a\n\nback seat. \n\n  Birds are not keen on freshly painted houses or wood that has\n\nbeen soaked with preservatives.\n Despite the fact the fresh paint and preserved wood may please the\n\nsensibilities of the builder, the gases given off by these materials can\n\nprove toxic in the confines of a birdhouse.\n\n\n  A good general rule of thumb is to always use natural wood.\n There is absolutely nothing wrong with making a box by nailing\n\ntogether four slabs of split firewood ( with the core removed).\n Two more slabs can be nailed in, one on each end, to finish the job.\n This makes an excellent bird-house.\n Old lumber that is already well weathered is also perfectly suitable.\n\n\n\n\n  One of the great shibboleths of all time is that a birdhouse\n\nshould have a peg for a perch on its front end.\n From the bird\'s point of view, this type of perch is invariably a\n\nnuisance and sometimes a danger.\n But because people want to see birds perching rather than in flight,\n\nthey tack one onto the house in the worst possible place: directly beneath\n\nthe entrance hole. \n\n  Birds normally swoop up when approaching a house.\n A peg beneath the entrance hole is not only in the way, but is\n\noriented at 90 degrees to what would be convenient for the bird.\n If the peg were removed and then nailed flat onto the face of the\n\nbird-house, just beneath the hole, it would give the bird something to hold\n\non to and at the same time allow trouble-free landings. \n\n  Similarly, when birds are leaving a house they tend to come out\n\nof the hole and dive away from the house, opening their wings just as\n\nthey start their plunge.\n If there is a peg underneath the hole the bird must either make an\n\nawkward movement onto it before flying away or risk damaging its\n\nunder-carriage as it begins its dive. \n\n  When building your birdhouse, you can make life much easier for\n\nyour air-borne friends by tacking a few small slats of wood, no more than a\n\nquarter of an inch deep, onto the house below the hole or by scoring the wood\n\ndeeply enough so that a bird can grip the front of the house with its\n\nfeet.\n See Figure 1.\n Birds are also adept at griping the lip of the entrance hole and\n\ncan do quite well without a perch at all. \n\n\n  Birdhouses can be designed to encourage specific species of birds\n\nand discourage others.\n Some birds, such as robins, are shelf nesters and will not use a\n\nhouse.\n Birds that do use houses prefer specific sizes and interior shapes,\n\nas well as various sizes for entrance holes.\n\n\n  There are some general rules for all birdhouses.\n For instance, a house should have a waterproof roof ( a piece of tin\n\nover the peak will do) and, in case of disaster, drainage at the bottom.\n A driving rain can force a lot of water through a birdhouse opening,\n\nso drill holes in the bottom of the house or clip the four bottom corners so\n\nthe water can drain out.\n Because birds, like people, don\'t appreciate drafts, be careful that\n\nthe drainage holes are not more than a quarter of an inch in diameter. \n\n  Predator proofing is also important since birds have many natural\n\nenemies, the most common being house cats and raccoons.\n Put an additional block on the front of the house or make the front\n\nwall extra thick so that a predator who has put a leg through the hole\n\nwon\'t be able to bend it down and pluck out a fledgling.\n While this won\'t terribly bother the house dwellers, it will\n\ninconvenience a hungry cat.\n .\n\n  Most birds don\'t like to occupy a house with an old nest in it.\n Try to get to the birdhouse after each nesting ( watch for the last\n\nfledgling to fly away) and clean it out for the next occupant.\n You can make this a simple task by designing a birdhouse that\n\nopens easily, as will a pinned front as seen in Figure 3. \n\n  As a final measure, you can help birds appreciably by sprinkling\n\na bit of diatomaceous earth ( fossil flour) in the bottom of a new birdhouse\n\nor in a newly cleaned house.\n Birds are not the tidiest of housekeepers and fledglings can\n\ngenerate an amazing amount of droppings both in and around the nest.\n These droppings encourage grubs to thrive; the grubs in turn present\n\na health danger to the fledglings.\n The diatomaceous earth, while perfectly safe for the birds, will\n\nscratch the carapace of a grub and cause it to dehydrate.  \n\n  Birdhouses will last longer if they are stored indoors over the\n\nwinter.\n This means you should use a mounting system that makes it easy\n\nto install and remove them.\n This can be done by using hooks or slots on the back of the birdhouse\n\nto match the bar on nails you\'ve placed in the side of a tree.\n When choosing a spot for the house, make sure it is out of the noon\n\n<l> day sun and in most cases, in a clear flight path. \n\n  If you follow these basic rules for birdhouse construction you\n\nwill he rewarded with an increased number of avian friends who ask for no\n\nmore than your tolerance and an occasional strawberry.  \n\n\n\n\n\n By Don Brenneman\n\n  " Public consciousness of organic fertilizers has\n\nincreased greatly in the last year or two,"  says Jim Taylor,\n\nprograms officer, feed and fertilizer, Agriculture Canada ( Vancouver).\n " We\'re receiving numerous inquiries at present - before,\n\nwe received very few."   \n\n  Across Canada, feed and fertilizer officers have seen the same\n\ntrend.\n Since their job includes interpreting federal regulations for\n\nfertilizer manufacturers, the department wrote a simplified guide about\n\norganics and sent it out.\n The three-page document is best summarized as follows: " If you say\n\nit, prove it." and " Guarantee what\'s in it."\n If the label says it\'s organic, then it has to be completely created\n\nfrom plants or animals: if the label says the minerals are natural, that\n\nmeans that nothing has been done to them other than crushing, drying or other\n\nsimilar procedures. \n\n  So where does this leave the average amateur organic\n\ngardener when it comes to fertilizers?\n\n\n  says\n\nDoug Harpur, president of Organics Corp., the largest manure composting\n\ncompany in Canada,  " you probably don\'t need to buy anything at all."\n\n\n This despite the fact that Organics owns composting plants in Nova\n\nScotia, Ontario, Manitoba and B.C., as well as a liquid fertilizer plant in\n\nB.C. that makes fish fertilizer and fish and seaweed combinations sold\n\nunder the Klondike and Organics labels. \n\n  " Nature was around a long time before garden centers\n\nwere,"  he says.\n " Sure, we\'re in business and we want to sell things.\n But at the same time, common sense dictates that if you\'re seriously\n\nbuilding your soil you won\'t need our products after awhile."  \n\n\n\n  This attitude flies in the face of the thinking of many chemical\n\ngardeners, who fertilize according to the type of plant they are growing.\n To avoid over-stimulating the leaf production in their vegetables,\n\nthey might regularly use a 5-10-10 fertilizer ( 5 per cent nitrogen, 10 per\n\ncent phosphorus and 10 per cent potassium), while using a 10-10-10 fertilizer\n\nfor corn, which uses a lot of nitrogen. \n\n\n  If your foremost concern is feeding your plants, it seems above\n\nreproach to use these three most-important nutrients.\n\n\nment of roots and flowers; and potassium ( potash), for strengthening\n\nthe plant.\n They are certainly cheaper from chemical sources.\n " Plants can\'t distinguish between nitrogen from a\n\nnatural source and nitrogen from a chemical source, and the same applies to\n\nother nutrients,"  says Taylor. \n\n  Harper agrees.\n " you can\'t compare\n\norganic gardening with chemical gardening because their goals are different.\n Organic gardeners are concerned with feeding the soil, not the\n\nplants.\n Healthy soil is the objective of organic gardening - healthy plants\n\nare simply the logical outgrowth."  \n\n  If you pick up a handful of dirt and let it trickle through your\n\nfingers, you see it completely differently depending on your point of view.\n From a chemical viewpoint, it\'s basically a dead medium for dead\n\nnutrients that are dissolved in dead water. \n\n  But from an organic viewpoint, this handful of soil contains an\n\ninterdependent community of more than 300,000 different species of\n\nmicroorganisms including bacteria, fungi, mold, yeast, diatoms and other\n\nmicroflora.\n It is estimated that just one gram of healthy soil holds 100 million\n\nsingle organisms.\n Furthermore, the soil is filled with the by-products of these organ\n\n<l> isms: antihistamines, antibiotics, vitamins, complex forms of the\n\nnutrients that break down slowly and water-absorbant rotted cells.  \n\n  This entire microscopic community lives in a natural balance that\n\nhas supported plant life since the beginning of time.\n Yet it is very fragile.\n Plow it, and you lose some of it to the wind.\n Expose it to the summer sun, and you kill some of the organisms.\n Spray a pest, and you destroy 20 per cent of the beneficial life.\n Burn it with chemical fertilizers, and you do away with another\n\nsignificant percentage. \n\n\n  " In a 7-7-7 fertilizer, only 21 per cent of what you\n\nbuy is actual fertilizer,"  says Harpur.\n " It\'s very important to know what the other 79 per cent\n\nis."  \n In most chemical fertilizers, it\'s salt or talc.\n If you don\'t use the fertilizer properly, there\'s a chance you could\n\nruin your whole garden in the process.\n You will certainly increase the salinity of the soil, and with\n\nrepeated use of chemicals, within five to ten years you won\'t have much of a\n\ngarden left. (\n Some natural sources of nutrients, such as muriate of potash and raw\n\nmanure, also have a dangerously high salt content.) \n\n   " Using chemicals tends to deplete the organic level in soil\n\nover a period of time.\n When North Americans first started farming the prairies, the level\n\nof organic matter was about ten per cent.\n\n\n   " Growing with chemical fertilizers is like using addictive\n\ndrugs; once you\'ve used them, you\'ve begun depleting the organic matter in\n\nthe earth and the soil bacteria finds it increasingly difficult to fix its\n\nown nitrogen level.\n So, of course, you have to add more and more nitrogen each year.\n\n\n   " Life on earth depends on the six-inch layer of topsoil\n\ncalled the plow layer.\n It\'s in this layer that all microbilogical activity takes\n\nplace.\n The plow layer produces almost all ground life as we know it.\n If you destroy that six-inch layer, you destroy all that life."\n\n  \n\n  What, then, should organic gardeners do if they have their soil\n\ntested and it\'s low in nitrogen?\n Common sense would suggest using organic fertilizers that are\n\nhigh in nitrogen, such as blood meal, coffee grounds, seaweed from down by\n\nthe beach or grass clippings.\n These choices might dismay the chemical gardener because their\n\nnitrogen levels aren\'t very high compared to nitrogen levels in artificial\n\nfertilizers. \n\n  " Composted manure only has guaranteed nutrient levels\n\nof 1-1-1," says Harpur.\n " But you can\'t judge manure by comparing it to a chemi\n\n<l> cal fertilizer.\n When you buy composted manure, the real reason you\'re buying\n\nit is that it contains 30 to 40 per cent organic matter.\n What this matter does is produce a healthier soil, which will\n\nautomatically work to fix the nitrogen level.\n\n\n\n\n  Healthier soil also produces better quality vegetables.\n A tomato that has been artificially stimulated to be bigger\n\nthan it should be is by definition a deformed tomato.\n The tomato raised organically is likely to have higher vitamin\n\nlevels, more trace minerals, a better taste and a longer shelf life.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'c4f02708-c06a-4a7a-afdc-a90348ddf5f9', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.901272+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9616580605506897, 'non_english_score': 0.0383419394493103}
{'text': 'the\n\nbeginning.\n We buy a pet.\n The pet needs training.\n We enrol in a class, then join a club and, from there, pick up\n\nmomentum. \n\n  One of the things I love most in dogs is helping newcomers.\n They\'re excited and, at the same time, a bit apprehensive.\n During the first few months of ownership, the best thing we can do is\n\nadvise and encourage.\n We must be available to answer the everyday questions that all new\n\nowners have.\n When the pup is their first show prospect, however, there are a few\n\nmore tricks to the trade. \n\n\n  Encourage new owners to take a class ASAP.\n Steer them to the right type of class, depending on whether the\n\npup is heading toward the breed or obedience ring.\n When the right class is unavailable, any kind is better than nothing.\n Puppy kindergarten is helpful in teaching the basics: stand, stay,\n\nwalk. \n\n  Owners can practise baiting, gaiting in various patterns and\n\nstacking at home or with local fanciers.\n Remind them puppies tire and bore easily, so training sessions should\n\nbe short and fun. \n\n  Suggest the right kind of leash and collar, and tell them the\n\npuppy needs to like what he\'s doing.\n The combination of first-time handler / young puppy makes for some\n\nchallenging sessions.\n\n\n  If you live in the area, it\'s helpful if you can also enrol in\n\nthe class or at least attend a few sessions.\n Then you can give tips.\n Some breeders invite local buyers over to their house for handling or\n\ntraining classes. \n\n  When you\'re sending the puppy across the province or half-way\n\naround the world, you\'ll have to make do with articles and a suggested\n\nreading list.\n Phone instructions are helpful, but most people retain more when\n\nthey\'re given a demonstration.\n Look through your national club list for someone in their area.\n Find the closest all-breed - or, even better, specialty - club and en\n\n<l> courage them to join. \n\n\n  Grooming for the pet encompasses the basics: nails, ears,\n\nbrushing and bathing.\n Intricacies are handled by professionals.\n\n\n  The puppy must learn to stand on a grooming table with its head\n\nin a \'noose.\'\n Sellers should demonstrate proper tools and methods of layered\n\nbrushing, trimming or clipping. \n\n  Through trial and error, exhibitors work their way through\n\nvarious shampoos and conditioners.\n What to pick?\n Shampoo for bronze, black or white; fleas or medicated; deodorizing,\n\nscented or non-scented.\n Cream rinse, hot oil or non-tangle.\n It\'s all so confusing!\n The voice of experience can save the day, the coat and the budget.\n\n\n\n  Then there\'s the choice of bristle, pin or slicker brush.\n And to comb or not to comb.\n Without instructions, a novice is lost.\n Some breeders offer to groom their \'grandpups\' until the buyer feels\n\ncomfortable doing it. \n\n  Show conditioning includes good nutrition.\n Using on-sale store brands or switching brands weekly isn\'t\n\ngoing to make that coat shine or trim that tummy.\n\n\n  Exercise builds up muscle tone.\n Breeders can advise when and how to conduct work-outs.\n Inform buyers about the pros and cons of using bicycles, jogging and\n\nso on. \n\n\n  I suggest buyers test the waters at a match, where a lot of us\n\nlearned the ropes.\n Things are more relaxed, and other exhibitors are happy to offer\n\nhelp.\n By the time we introduce our protegées to the first dog\n\nshow, they\'re wide-eyed with excitement.  \n\n  I encourage buyers to do their own handling.\n Watching them move the dog allows me to offer hints to slow down or\n\ntake longer steps.\n Otherwise, I offer to handle the dog, or recommend an alternative.\n\n\n\n  Many pet owners, when considering exhibiting, are concerned\n\nwith the expense or the amount of travelling involved.\n Usually, I send the owner a list of area shows and make several\n\nrecommendations.\n Starting slowly is the key.\n Once they\'ve a taste of the win and hold that first blue ribbon,\n\nthey\'ll often ask  you  what shows are next! \n\n  In their enthusiasm, some hate to take a break during the teenage\n\ngawkies.\n My suggestion is to show the dog during puppyhood, take a\n\nhiatus during the \'teens,\' and bring the dog back out when he is mature. \n\n\n  Sometimes eager novices try something new or learn a better way\n\nto accomplish the job, and can show us a thing or two.\n\n\n\n\n\n Garnering as much information as possible about an incoming dog\n\ncan assist you in making the best placement. \n\n  "\n\ncrisis-proofing" by developing and following policies and standards,\n\nit\'s wise to keep in mind the " 80-20 rule," in which 80 per cent of problems\n\narise from 20 per cent of the causes.\n By far, the prevailing cause of trouble in rescue organizations is\n\npoor communication.\n Consider the rescue volunteer who asked why an owner wanted to\n\ngive up his dog.\n " " Allergies" " was the answer.\n Presuming a family member could not tolerate canine dander,\n\nimagine the volunteer\'s surprise when she discovered it was the  dog\n\n that had severe allergies requiring intensive veterinary treatment and\n\nadopters willing to provide specialized care.\n How much easier it would have been to ask a few pertinent questions\n\nand be prepared! \n\n  Effective screening practices can help keep the bad apples out of\n\nyour program and reduce the risk of inappropriate dogs being placed in\n\nunsuitable homes.\n For each incoming rescue dog, there are a minimum of two\n\nessential conversations, during which vital questions must be asked: the\n\nintake call where the animal is evaluated for adoptability and the\n\nplacement call, where a prospective owner is assessed to ensure he / she will\n\nprovide an appropriate home for your rescue dog. \n\n  The screening process need not be an interrogation.\n In fact, it works much better if it\'s considered a " friendly chat\n\nwith a purpose."\n The end result should reveal the real reasons a dog is being turned\n\nin and exactly why a prospective adopter wishes to own a second-hand dog from\n\nyour program. \n\n  For incoming rescue dogs it is essential to determine the dog\'s\n\nphysical description ( age, sex, size); veterinary history ( medication,\n\nillnesses); behaviour ( temperament, manners, training); ownership ( is the\n\nperson legally able to turn over the dog?); and reason(s) for wishing to\n\nplace the dog in rescue ( why is it unwanted?). \n\n  It is more difficult to find out these details about dogs in\n\nanimal shelters, but often, in the case of owner turn-in, shelter staff will\n\nhave some background information. \n\n  Prospective adopters require a completed application\n\nform on file detailing basic information ( physical environment, number and\n\nages of children, other pets, work hours, etc.).\n It\'s helpful to ask potential adopters to include a short\n\ndescription of their ideal dog and their reasons for adopting.\n Further interview(s) should focus on their beliefs about raising\n\nand training dogs, and their past experiences, as well as reviewing the\n\napplication information. \n\n\n  Since most people have a listening efficiency of just 25 per\n\ncent ( the remaining 75 per cent of information is ignored, mis <l>\n\ninterpreted or forgotten), it takes a great deal of effort to really hear\n\nwhat is being said.\n Always take notes during a screening conversation and prepare a\n\nchecklist of frequently asked questions.\n Don\'t make assumptions; jumping to conclusions and not asking enough\n\nquestions to properly evaluate the situation invites unwanted surprises.\n A " fenced yard" to some can mean decorative railing with spaces a\n\ncow could walk through. \n\n  Insist on clarity.\n If the speaker\'s meaning is vague, don\'t be afraid to ask for clarifi\n\n<l> cation, even if it takes several attempts -  " I\'m not sure I\n\nunderstand what you mean by \'Sparky can\'t be trusted with kids\' - can you\n\nexplain?"  \n\n  Ask open-ended questions that invite descriptive answers, as\n\nopposed to " closed" questions that tend to result in a " yes" or " no"\n\nanswer.\n will often be answered\n\nnegatively ( some people do not consider nips or grabs to be real biting).\n " Tell me the things that you should not do with your dog"\n\n may lead you to the response you are looking for.   \n\n  Watch for " red flag" phrases.\n Learn to hear warning signals, as there may be underlying reasons for\n\nplacing a dog:  " I need to get rid of him before my husband gets\n\nhome"  could be a hint that Fido is the pawn in a marriage breakup.\n might mean\n\na prospective adopter does not have a particularly healthy\n\nphilosophy about leashes. \n\n  Listen for non-verbal cues.\n The tone of the speaker\'s voice can provide a world of information.\n Is the message being delivered in an insistent tone?\n Is it pleading or unsympathetic?\n Sudden subject changes and interruptions can mean you\'ve hit upon a\n\ntender topic.\n Even the pregnant pause after you ask an important question can be a\n\ntelltale sign of someone frantically trying to devise the right answer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  smaller place,\n\nso the dog fancy appears to become more cosmopolitan and international.\n The ease and speed of air travel is now such that breeders from one\n\ncountry can travel at their leisure to view stock at the other end of the\n\nworld, while judges regularly officiate in many countries other than their\n\nhomeland. \n\n  The question of standardizing the breed standards seems to be a\n\nregular item on the agenda of the much-talked about, but possibly grossly\n\noverrated, World Congresses of Kennel Clubs, and there is obvious\n\nconcern that the written blueprint for certain breeds varies\n\nconsiderably from one governing body to another. \n\n  In reality, any differences in wording of breed standards are\n\nvery much secondary to the differences that exist physically, where breeds\n\nhave been developed in such a way that breed type differs quite dramatically\n\nfrom country to country. \n\n  It is a fact that while some breed standards may read\n\ndifferently on an intercontinental basis, their essence is the same, and\n\nlittle harm is done by the variation in expression.\n Yet even so, some breeds have unequivocally gone off in a different\n\ndirection from the mainstream in some countries, the reason being\n\nfashion or a shift in priorities.\n Breeders may choose to develop certain features of a breed to the\n\npoint of exaggeration; that is their choice.\n But they should never forget that they should be breeding to a\n\nstandard that was developed by the founding fathers of that breed, each\n\nclause of which was included for a definite functional reason.\n It is for this reason that breeders should make it their business to\n\nstudy the history of their breed in the greatest possible detail, and\n\nthis is where so many present-day breeders fall down. \n\n  Given that different countries have developed certain\n\nbreeds to suit their own tastes - albeit, in some cases, while still\n\nremaining within the often-generous parameters of the existing breed standard\n\n- a major problem arises when judges are invited from overseas,\n\nespecially from the breed\'s country of origin.  \n\n\n\n  If we think of British breeds that have been \'refined\' in other\n\nlands, the most-often-cited example is, not surprisingly, the English\n\nSpringer Spaniel in the United States and Canada.\n While one must accept that the modern transatlantic Springer has ac\n\n<l> quired a definite \'look,\' I cannot help wondering whether or not\n\nthis is the result of markings, presentation and handling styles, rather than\n\nmajor structural differences.\n Personally, I find the Rough Collies, Shetland Sheepdogs and\n\nGolden Retrievers across the Atlantic to be rather more different than\n\nthe British ideal, and these are just a few of the breeds that spring instant\n\n<l> ly to mind. \n\n  When clubs invite overseas judges to judge breeds that are\n\nnative to them, do they expect them to judge as they would at home, looking\n\nfor the same type, or would they rather the judges change their basic\n\nperception of the breed and adapt their eye to suit the local dogs? \n\n  This is one of the hardest jobs that can face any judge, and\n\nthey must really be true to themselves if their integrity is to remain\n\nintact.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '01ff58d9-eb08-4630-9435-850a933d65c8', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.902576+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9634595513343811, 'non_english_score': 0.036540448665618896}
{'text': 'A large pack of Canadian cowboys and cowgirls migrated south to\n\nthe National Western Stock Show and Rodeo in Denver, Colorado.\n The twenty-three performance rodeo ran for twelve days from January\n\n10th through 21st. \n\n  Water Valley, Alberta cowboy and 1987 Canadian Calf Roping\n\nChampion and Rookie of the Year, Mark Nugent was the leader of the pack.\n He collected a total of &dollar;13,397 for the three calves he\n\ntied down in a total time of 30.4 seconds. \n\n  A 10.7 in the first go tied for second and third, and a payout of\n\n&dollar;3,299.\n He was 9.6 in the second go which gathered another &dollar;2,764\n\nand a shot at the short-go.\n Yet another rapid time of 10.1 took second placing and &dollar;1,182.\n The largest payoff for Nugent was the average at &dollar;6,152 for his\n\ntop placing, 9-tenths of a second ahead of Oklahoma calf roper, Mike\n\nJohnson. \n\n  The calf ropers competed for the highest total payout of\n\n&dollar;67,342.\n The fastest time in this event was an 8.8 by Brad Gleason in the 2nd\n\ngo-round. \n\n  Three Canadian saddle bronc riders came out of it with some\n\ndollars as well.\n A 77 in the 2nd go for Duane Daines of Innisfail, Alberta, split\n\nfirst and second for &dollar;2,872.\n Mayerthorpe\'s Denny Hay, and Guy Shapka of Spruce View also picked up\n\ncheques in the 2nd go-round.\n Hay received &dollar;812 with a 75 score for a 4th/5th split, and\n\nShapka slid into 9th/10th with a 73 for &dollar;65. \n\n  Billy Etbauer of South Dakota won the event with 227 points on\n\nthree head. \n\n  Steer wrestler, Todd Boggust of Paynton, Saskatchewan had a\n\nrespectable showing and qualified for the short-go.\n A time of 4.4 in the 2nd and 4.6 in the short-go put him in a split\n\nfor 6th and 7th in the average and a total take-home pay of &dollar;1,921.\n\n\n\n  Tom Shuckburgh of Stettler also had a run of 4.4 in the 2nd\n\ngo-round, squeezing into the tie for 7th thru 10th to pick up &dollar;198 to\n\nhelp cover expenses. \n\n  Butch Bode clocked the fastest time in the event with a 3.6, and\n\nthe average was won by Tom Duvall with 12.7 seconds on three steers.\n\n\n\n  A relative newcomer to the professional barrel racing\n\nline-up, Della Kennedy of Red Deer clocked a total time of 46.70 over\n\nthree runs to confirm an average placing of 9th for &dollar;407.\n Six time World Champion, Charmayne James-Rodman had the fastest times\n\nin two runs and the average with an accumulated time of 45.96. \n\n  Robin Burwash of Okotoks, Alberta was the only Canadian bareback\n\nrider to pick up a cheque.\n A 76 marking in the 1st go slid into a split for last hole and\n\n&dollar;29. \n\n  1989 World All Around Champion, Ty Murray of Odessa, Texas accumu\n\n<l> lated &dollar;10,783 in the three riding events to win the All Around\n\ntitle.\n He also won the average in the bareback event with 312 points on four\n\nhead, contributing &dollar;6,002 to his total.\n Another &dollar;2,167 in the saddle bronc and &dollar;3,127 in the\n\nbull riding claimed the title for him. \n\n  Montana cowboy, Clint Branger won the bull riding with high\n\nplacings in three of the four rounds for 309 total points. \n\n  Bobby DelVecchio on B52 and Dan Wolfe on\n#72 of the Beutler/Gaylord string had the high marked rides in the bull\n\nriding, and for all the riding events with 86s. \n\n  California cowboys, David Motes and Dennis Watkins put it all\n\ntogether in the team roping with a total time of 17.3 on three runs to win\n\nthe average.\n A 5.0 by Robert Scogin and Walt Rodman was the fastest time in\n\nthe event. \n\n  There was a total payoff of &dollar;358,463 and over 1100 entries\n\nin the seven events.\n\n\n  A number of Canadian competitors also travelled west to Portland,\n\nOregon for the Wrangler Pro Rodeo Classic, January 12 to 14th. \n\n  Saddle bronc riders Rod Hay and Duane Daines both picked up some\n\nof the payout.\n Hay was third for &dollar;464 and Dames won &dollar;155 in a split\n\nfor fourth.\n Gerald James of Williams Lake, B.C., took third in the bull riding\n\nfor &dollar;457 and Millet, Alberta bareback rider, Shawn Vant was fourth in\n\nhis event to receive &dollar;232. \n\n  The 1990 World Standings were\n\nnot available at press time.   \n\n\n\n\n  If any of you ladies were fortunate enough to receive one of\n\nthose Ropers & Riders calendars for 1990, you would probably have enjoyed the\n\nmonth of January.\n Ricky\n\n  Rocky   Mountain House was the only Canadian featured in\n\nthis year\'s collection of handsome cowboys.\n For his participation, Chris received a number of calendars, which\n\nwere sold during the Canadian Finals, with the proceeds going to the\n\nCowboys Benefit Fund.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Christmas holidays in Hobbema, Alberta are unique with the\n\nCowboy\'s Christmas Rodeo attracting contestants and rodeo fans from all\n\nacross Canada and the United States.\n A total payoff of &dollar;55,000 brought Canadian and World Champions\n\nto the four-day event beginning on Boxing Day.\n Presentations of various Native nations on horseback during the\n\ngrand entries and Native dancers added to the spirit of the events, as did\n\nthe appearances of Santa Claus riding a flashy saddle bronc. \n\n  Wayne Vold provided the excellent bucking stock and contributed\n\nto the opening ceremonies each day by singing the National Anthem. \n\n  Australian cowboy, Bernie Smyth, took the All Around Cowboy\n\nhonors, competing in the calf roping and earning &dollar;1,281 in the\n\nsaddle bronc with an 80 point ride on Copenhagen Houdini to split second and\n\nthird with Chris Anderson of Rocky Mountain House, also riding the Northcott\n\nRodeo\'s bronc.\n Dode Givens of Riverton, Wyoming, took top placing in the saddle\n\nbronc with an 81 on Mainstream.\n Duane Daines on Blazing Saddles and Mel Coleman on Spanish Angles\n\nsplit 4th and 5th with 77s. \n\n  A spectacular ride by Wes Cyr of Milo, Alberta, on Katmandoo\n\nearned the highest marking of 87 in the bull riding, taking home\n\n&dollar;2,294.\n Shepherd, Montana cowboy, Chuck Simonson was second with a 78 on\n\nCorey.\n This good bull also took World Champion Tuff Hedeman to the pay\n\nwindow with a 77 score in a tie for third with Bruce Robinson on Beetle\n\nJuice. \n\n  The third performance on December 28th proved to be very\n\nexciting in the calf roping event.\n Tim Williamson moved to the lead with a very smooth 8.3 second run.\n Two more cowboys went, then it was younger brother, Cliff\'s turn.\n\n\n\n  Capturing the Canadian title in Edmonton the month before,\n\nbut having a rather disappointing ten days in Las Vegas at the NFR, he wanted\n\na win.\n And win it, he did.\n With a 8.2 he took the lead from Tim and kept it to the end to\n\nreceive the cheque for &dollar;2,056. \n\n  Gerald Willsie, 1989 High Point Winner and Steer Wrestling\n\nChampion from Caroline, Alberta proved he\'s tough in the calf roping as well\n\nwith an 8.3 in the final performance to equal - Tim Williamson\'s time.\n Only a half second margin separated first place from eight in\n\nthis event. \n\n  C.P.R.A. President, Jim Dunn of Balzac, Alberta marked an 81\n\non Northcott\'s CFR horse, Dark Alley, in the bareback riding.\n Shawn Vant of Millet, Alberta with a 78 score on Ponoka Stampede, was\n\none point ahead of two other Alberta cowboys; Bill Boyd of Olds on Crown\n\nRoyal, and Cochrane\'s Keith Ullery mastering come Apart both score 77s. \n\n  Black Diamond\'s Frank H. Thompson lead the steer wrestlers\n\nto the pay window for &dollar;2,141 with a fast time of 4.1.\n This also put him into a tie for the lead in the season standings for\n\nthe steer wrestling event with Calgary\'s Rob Wilson.\n Wilson dogged one down in 4.4 seconds to take fourth place and\n\n&dollar;1,303 \n\n  There were a number of Montana cowboys that made the trip north\n\nof the border this Christmas, and two of them, Jay Bob Lytle and Tim Garrison\n\nclocked steer wrestling runs of 4.3 to share second and third place money.\n\n\n\n  Consort, Alberta cowboy, Darren Zieffle had the spectators\n\nconcerned when he took a horn in the ribs from his steer.\n He was fortunate to have only bruised ribs and was released that\n\nevening from hospital. \n\n  An excellent run and time of 14.32 by Bella Kennedy of Bentley,\n\nAB, took first place in the  barrel racing, followed by\n\nSuzanne DePaoli of DeWinton with a 44.48.\n Edson, Alberta cowgirl, Sylvia Shirley, ran a time of 14.72 for\n\nthird, only one/one hundredth of a second ahead of Mary Lynn Walter of\n\nLethbridge. \n\n  A high mark of 82 for Cole Harvey from Lower Nicola, B.C., was\n\nfirst in the  steer riding, with Mayerthorpe.\n\n\n  After two second placings and a first in the final of four\n\ngo-rounds in the novice saddle bronc, Mike Stanton of Spruce View, Alberta\n\nwas on top in the average, followed by Creighton Lund of Pine Lake, Alberta.\n\n\n\n  The team of Rocky Dallyn and Murray Linthicum made a fast\n\nrun of 5.4 in the team roping to share the first place cheque for\n\n&dollar;2,063.\n Canadian champion calf roper, Joe Lucas and partner Guy Chomestik\n\nwere second with a 5.7.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  A legend of professional rodeo, the Colonel, as he\'s known to his\n\nfriends, will gradually phase out of the bucking stock business.\n says the 70-year-old\n\nRosemary rancher,  " but it\'s time."  \n\n  Kesler rode into the Rosemary country ( in the Brooks area) on a\n\nsaddle horse in 1943 and bought 200 acres of land.\n Since then, he\'s built something of an empire and now has\n\nholdings at New Dayton ( near Raymond) where he grew up, Missoula, Montana,\n\nand a wintering ground in Texas. \n\n  During the 1989 Canadian Finals in Edmonton, Kesler was inducted\n\ninto the Cowboy Hall of Fame. \n\n  He recently stepped down as a member of the Professional Rodeo\n\nCowboys Association board of directors after nearly 10 years of service.\n\n\n\n \n\n  " I\'ve had so many phone calls from rodeo committees -\n\nand not just mine - who are really concerned about me leaving the board,"\n\n says Kesler.\n " It makes you feel good. It\'s sure better than them\n\ncussing    you   ."   \n\n\n  He\'s also begun cutting down on his horse herd, which numbers\n\nabout 450.\n\n\nhe admits.\n " And I\'m going to start liquidating my assets at Rose\n\n<l> mary.\n We\'ll relocate on our land near New Dayton and enlarge it for a\n\nsmall cattle operation and that\'s it."  \n\n  He promises to continue working with the rodeos he had for two\n\nmore years. \n\n  " I\'ve got a lot of friends in the rodeo business and a\n\nguy doesn\'t want to lose those connections, really,"  he says  .\n\n  It\'s likely his rodeos and the stock outfit will wind up in the\n\nhands of his son Greg and grandson Duane.\n\n\n  " You can\'t give rodeos to your son and grandson,"\n\n says Kesler.\n " And I\'m not really selling the stock outfit.\n .\n\nThe family is    kind of   independent and they\n\ngo on their own.\n\n\n   " I know Calgary and several other people are interested in\n\nour horses and why wouldn\'t they be?\n We\'ve had a breeding program for 40 years and 95% of our horses,\n\nmaybe more, are ranch-raised.\n\n\n \n\n\n  The place at Rosemary, now 2,500 acres large with 1,000 of it\n\nirrigated, is for sale now. \n\n  " I\'m starting to say my farewells, but I won\'t be out\n\nof the business until the end of 1992,"  says Kesler.\n " It all depends on the economy.\n Fifteen years ago, when things were moving, I could have sold that\n\nland without a bat of an eye."   \n\n  The colonel noted that during his Hall of Fame induction,\n\nrecently-retired bull rider Don Johnsen, looking through a thin Kesler\n\nscrapbook, expressed surprise  " that I once rode bulls"  .\n\n\n\n  " I told him I worked every event in rodeo longer\n\nthan anyone on record.\n\n\n\n\n  Those deeds are all logged in two or three other scrapbooks, fat\n\nones, that Kesler left home that weekend. \n\n  Among his most prized possessions is the first trophy saddle\n\never presented in rodeo.\n Kesler received it as the 1948 Canadian All-Around champion and\n\ntoday, having been used, it sits in the bedroom of his place at Rosemary.\n\n\n\n  he recall.\n " People wondered who this nobody was who won the\n\nall-around."  \n\n  He went on to win two more - in 1951 and 1953 - a record at the\n\ntime, and everybody quickly knew nobody. \n\n  Kesler also came with a booming voice and never again was he\n\nunheard.  \n\n\n\n William Desmond ( Bill) Thompson ( March 3, 1934 to\n\nJanuary 18, 1990)  \n\n  Bill Thompson has been the most sincere and hard working\n\nrodeo committee member that the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede had.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '4fbffe5b-1b34-4867-8376-fbf8a8b29120', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.904138+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9726817011833191, 'non_english_score': 0.027318298816680908}
{'text': 'Cats Ready For Record Year... quality\n\nand engineering advances take the cat\'s pride a leap ahead of the pack! \n\n  \n\n  There\'s an air of excitement in the northern Minnesota town of\n\nThief River Falls, as the 1991 Arctic Cats roll off the assembly line.\n Led by the top performance Wildcat 700, the new models embody a host\n\nof engineering refinements that will bring a smile to the face of every\n\nArctic Cat enthusiast. \n\n  Snowmobile Canada toured the factory with Joel Hallstrom, to bring\n\nyou this special report on the latest developments in the Arctic cat\n\nline for  . \n\n  \' 90\n\n .\n The new cat has a larger piston, and a new cylinder with a different\n\nhead design and a new crank design to adapt the increased horsepower.\n Like all Arctic Cats, the Suzuki motor powering the Wildcat embodies\n\nlong term durability. \n\n  The move to a 700cc engine was in response to consumer demand for\n\nhigher performance and increased horsepower.\n Arctic engineers feel that the 700 will be the top muscle sled in the\n\nindustry for 1991.\n Transmission, chaincase, and drive components remain essentially\n\nthe same, other than calibration. \n\n  To adapt to the additional horsepower, the Comet clutch has been\n\nrecalibrated with different weights and ramps.\n The engine cooling system remains unchanged from 1990, with a heat\n\nexchanger mounted in the top rear of the tunnel, where the snow is thrown up\n\nfrom the track.\n The basic chassis of the new Wildcat differs from the original\n\nWildcat version in the fact that the front end spindles and A-arms have\n\nincorporated advancements that were introduced on last season\'s EXT Special\n\nracing sled.\n A-arms are now chromalloy tubular steel, and one inch wider on\n\neither side.\n \' 91\n\n .\n With longer A-arms you can go to a shorter spindle, which gives you\n\nthe same amount of travel with a lower centre of gravity.\n The 1991 Wildcat will be even more stable than the previous editions.\n The Wildcat skis are also new for 1991, with a more rounded ski loop,\n\nand a reduced rear side support to cut weight and reduce clearance\n\naround the sway bar.\n The biggest change to the ski is in the cross section, with the new\n\nski offering a lighter feel to the front end.\n Arctic Cats have always been a ski-dominated machine, which resulted\n\nin a feeling of lightness in the track ... for 1991, the new ski profile\n\nwill improve the control balance between skis and track, producing a\n\nmuch better handling sled.\n Wildcat, EXT and EXT Special models will all have carbides as\n\nstandard equipment this season.\n For spring riding on sticky snow Arctic offers a plastic ski\n\naccessory. \n\n  For 1991 Wildcat is also available in the Mountain Cat version,\n\nwhich offers a 345cm track mounted on an extended rail skid frame.\n Mountain Cats have an additional heat exchanger to catch the snow\n\nthrown up by the longer track.\n Mountain Cats which were initially designed for the Western North\n\nAmerica market, have become very popular in the mid-west and they are\n\nbeginning to gain popularity in the east as well.\n Like a long wheelbase touring car, they offer smoother ride and great\n\ntrail performance ... you can expect to see many more of these sleds on the\n\ntrails this year. \n\n  For 1991, Arctic Cat will be building carbureted versions\n\nand fuel injected versions of the mighty Wildcat.\n The Wildcat EFI will be available in very limited quantities ... why\n\nlimited production?\n Primarily because the Arctic engineers feel that EFI systems on a\n\nsnowmobile are at the beginning of a development phase, with many\n\nadvances yet to come.\n The EFI models perform pretty much the same, with a slightly better\n\nacceleration out of the hole and through the low end, because the EFI uses a\n\n46mm throttle body, compared to the 40mm model on the carbureted\n\nversion.\n The acceleration advantage comes from the larger carb and greater air\n\nfuel mix throttled to the engine at the 100% correct rate.\n The EFI senses temperature, barometric pressure, engine RPM, and so\n\nforth, to give the engine the exact amount of fuel.\n There is no noticeable difference in the top end between the standard\n\nand EFI Wildcats.\n The performance difference that will be most obvious will be in\n\nsituations where a rider starts out at one altitude and rides to different\n\nelevations.\n The EFI will compensate for the carburetion required at various eleva\n\n<l> tions.\n A properly tuned carbureted version jetted for a particular elevation\n\nshould run with an EFI at any particular altitude. \n\n  In practice, the EFI system is quite convenient.\n You no longer have to choke your engine, because when you fire it up,\n\nyou have a several second delay, while the fuel is pumped from the tank into\n\na gold fuel rail; when the rail is filled, fuel is pumped directly into the\n\ninjector.\n You then start the machine, the injectors kick in and feed fuel into\n\nthe throttle body. \n\n  This is the first use of EFI on an Arctic Cat snowmobile.\n The advantages are obvious for certain riding situations, but the\n\nbottom line will be in the consumer acceptance of the rather costly EFI\n\nsystems.\n Performance will be enhanced, but will EFI be a requirement for\n\nnon-muscle sleds?\n\n\n  Cruising range with the 34 litre gas tank should be 200-240 km,\n\non hard packed trails at trail speeds.\n That range drops considerably below 160km when you run the Wildcat\n\nreal fast. \n\n  Looking for an Wildcat EFI for 1991?\n Be prepared.\n Early season bookings for the model have already exceeded production\n\nplanning ... if you haven\'t already reserved yours, better try for a  model.\n Those who have been lucky enough to reserve their EFI sleds, will\n\nenjoy the privilege of having a special nameplate engraved and installed on\n\ntheir machine ... it\'s just one more bit of icing on the Arctic Cat cake for\n\n . \n\n\n  The sled that won the Jeep 500, the EXT Special, will be one of\n\nthree EXT models available for 1991.\n This sled, second only to the Wildcat in top performance specifica\n\n<l> tions, has been a popular model in the Arctic Cat line for the past three\n\nseasons. \n\n  The standard EXT rides on the AFS chassis, the same frame as\n\nthe Wildcat, but powered by the 530 reed valve engine.\n This model also gets the tubular A-arms and the shorter leg spindle\n\nfor the wider ski stance and lower centre of gravity.\n The EXT is also available in a Mountain Cat version, and an EXT\n\nSpecial, for racing purposes.\n The 1991 stock EXT is essentially the same sled that won the Jeep 500\n\nand the A stock events at Eagle River last winter, as well as many other\n\ncross country and oval races, with the main addition being the rebuildable\n\ngas shocks in the skid frame.\n EXT comes standard with carbide skags, and all of the top line Arctic\n\nCat sleds, Wildcats, EXTs Prowlers, and so forth come with halogen headlight\n\nfor increased night visibility. \n\n  The EXT performance ranks second only to the Wildcat.\n One of the more popular sleds in the Arctic line, the EXT provides\n\nexcellent trail performance, top end speed, and fuel efficiency in a very\n\nsporty sled.\n Wildcat, with 100 plus horsepower, is of course a faster sled than\n\nthe EXT with its 70-75hp engine, but the EXT is definitely not a slow\n\nmachine.\n Compare it to a 750cc motorcycle lined up against a 1000cc\n\nsuperbike - both vehicles are fast, but one is just  that <it/> much\n\nfaster. \n\n  With the exception of the tubular steel A-arms and the short\n\nspindles and a slightly softer shock absorber valving, the EXT remains\n\nessentially unchanged.\n Reverse gear is optional on the EXT, and is a popular option for\n\ntrail sleds.\n Cost is reasonable, weight addition is 3.5-4 kg.\n\n\n  The 1991 EXT Special is a totally different breed of cat from the\n\n1990 edition.\n Last year, the EXT Special shared the chassis and motor with the EXT\n\nstandard model, the only difference was the 99cm ski stance of the\n\nSpecial, compared to the 94cm stance of the standard model, and the use of\n\ngas shocks and a few lighter components on the Special. \n\n  This year, the EXT Special will be built on the double-wishbone\n\nAFS chassis of the Prowler, with the double wishbone A-arms and cast aluminum\n\nspindle, and longer front shock absorber in front, and gas shocks on the skid\n\nframe.\n The EXT Special has a 550 piston port engine, compared to the 529cc\n\nreed valve engine on the standard EXT.\n The 550 is a lighter engine because it doesn\'t have reed valves, and\n\nit is a smaller engine thanks to the crankshaft driven water pump, instead of\n\nthe pulley and belt type water pump of the EXT.\n Performance and horsepower are similar for both engines, and both\n\nsport 38mm carbs and single pipe exhaust.\n You might say that the EXT Special for 1991 is more of a " Super\n\nProwler" than a direct descendant of the 1990 EXT.\n The change brings with it a real enhancement in chassis technology,\n\nand the main benefit will be in handling ... the  model has a\n\nlighter chassis, and it will feel more agile on the trails.\n With the Prowler style seat, it has more room to crawl up on the\n\nmachine to get farther forward for that extra  " body english"\n\n you want to really enjoy sporty performance. \n\n  Compare the EXT Special with the Prowler Special and you will\n\nfind the 99cm ski stance on both sleds.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  After several years of concentrating on entry-level snowmobile\n\ntechnology, Yamaha has shifted its attention to the high performance\n\nmodels for 1991, with an array of muscle sleds, sports models, and family\n\nperformance machines that is nothing short of revolutionary. \n\n  Yamaha engineers have taken a long and hard look at the Exciter\n\nprogram ... they analyzed the suspension components, combining the best\n\nof each style: the skis and front end of the  Exciter II come\n\nfrom Phazer II, with non-nitrogen charged shocks, and an aluminum\n\nscissor link to reduce weight in the front end.\n There\'s a new version of the SRV rear suspension with a coil spring\n\nover shock to produce significantly less resistance due to friction than you\n\nwould have with a torsion spring.\n The pro action link suspension is easily adjustable, and with\n\nrising rate it adjusts itself as the suspension stroke increases.\n This rear suspension features very long travel, more than ever before\n\non Exciter.\n The best aspects of the earlier Exciter suspension have been\n\nretained, including the torsion bar, and the aggressive wide block pattern\n\ntrack from Yokohama. \n\n  Under the hood, the Exciter II has been greatly enhanced, with\n\ntechnological advances in virtually every system.\n Exciter owners will relate tales of clutch and carburetion recalls\n\ncovering previous model year sleds.\n Yamaha Canada earned the respect of the snowmobile community by\n\nstanding firmly behind their product in a comprehensive program to\n\nadjust Exciter models to optimum performance.\n The main areas of concern were clutch and carburetion.\n This year, Yamaha has redesigned the carburetor, and the cylinder.\n The angle of the carburetor is now different, which affects\n\nperformance.\n There\'s a brand new YXRC clutch designed to take lots more horsepower\n\nthan Exciter currently produces.\n The YXRC has been thoroughly field tested, and has been shown to\n\ndeliver excellent performance, with virtually no belt wear and no clutch wear\n\nover very extended distances.\n This YXRC clutch has a wider ratio than any other clutching system on\n\nthe market.\n The secondary clutch for 1991 Exciter II is a larger diameter model,\n\nto compliment the YXRC. \n\n  There are a number of new components appearing for the first time\n\non the Exciter II, including the first digital computerized ignition ...\n\na special computer chip reads the rpm and the load, and advances the spark to\n\nprecisely match every given point of the rpm.\n While most CDI ignitions have a very flat curve, and retard at 4000\n\nrpm and continue to retard the spark as rpm increases, the Yamaha\n\ncomputerized ignition can offer mega advance around 4000 rpm, to burn off\n\nsome of the unspent fuel ... this is one of the reasons why Exciter II is\n\ngoing to astonish riders with its improved performance.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '3761fb95-5608-4d82-a325-f99fe23d2dea', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.905385+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': "Thirty years from now, when I have a grandchild on each knee, both\n\neager to hear tall tales, I'll probably tell them about the three days I\n\nspent on Quebec's Ste. Marguerite River in 1989. \n\n  My tale will begin innocuously enough.\n I'll tell them that I had just flown back from an unsuccessful trip to\n\nthe Kegaska, a pretty-as-a-picture river on Quebec's lower North Shore,\n\nand that I was a little tired when I climbed into my car, at six in the\n\nmorning, for the eight-hour drive from Montreal to Sacre-Coeur. \n\n  But the sun was out, it was warm, and I was off to fish a river\n\nI'd never seen before.\n That alone would have been enough to lift my spirits nine times out of\n\n10.\n On this trip, however, my angling companions were to include Lee and\n\nJoan Wulff, both fly-fishing legends in their own time.\n My growing happiness was mixed with a little fear and trepidation.\n\n\n\n  Lee has accomplished more with a fly rod than any other angler in\n\nhistory, and Joan isn't far behind.\n I would be thrown in with the elite of my recently adopted sport, a\n\nrank amateur casting with the pros. \n\n  At least that's how I viewed it.\n I didn't want to be the odd man out in this deal, the only one of our\n\ngroup not to hook a fish.\n But given my lack of experience, and the fact that I was still\n\nstruggling to perfect some sort of casting technique, I knew this was a\n\ndistinct possibility. \n\n  For the moment, though, being behind the wheel of my car, with my\n\nfly-rod beside me, was enough.\n And the scenery was great.\n I'd taken the South Shore route, driving from Montreal to Quebec\n\nCity, then continuing on to Rivi&egrave;re du Loup.\n At that point I took a break from driving, crossing over to the upper\n\nNorth Shore on the ferry to St. Simeon.\n From there it was just a short hop, via Tadoussac, to the ZEC office\n\nin Sacre-Coeur. \n\n  In addition to myself and the Wulffs, this trip, organized by the\n\nQuebec government, was to include John    Randolph\n\n  , the editor of  Fly Fisherman  magazine, Nelson Bryant,\n\nthe outdoor columnist for the  New York Times  , André\n\nBellemare and George Gruenefeld, who fulfill the same roles for Quebec's \n\nLe Soleil  and Montreal's  Gazette  respectively, and Jeannot\n\nRuel, an editor with Quebec's largest outdoor magazine,  Sentier,\n\nChasse-P&ecircumflex;che  . \n\n  There were also a number of participants from the Quebec Ministry\n\nof Recreation, Hunting and Fishing ( MLCP), which is responsible for managing\n\nthe province's salmon rivers ( under a special arrangement with the federal\n\ngovernment).\n André Boucher, the MLCP's director of public relations would\n\nbe our host, aided by Raynald Loiselle, also with the PR department, and\n\nPierre Fillion. \n\n  The moving force behind the whole expedition, however, was\n\nLee Wulff.\n During the 60 or so years that he has fished for Atlantic salmon, Lee\n\nhas formed some pretty strong opinions on how the resource should be\n\nmanaged, and he wanted to explain some of these ideas to the Quebec angling\n\ncommunity.\n Having a sort of open forum between representatives from the Quebec\n\ngovernment and the media seemed to be the best way to go. \n\n  Of course, Lee had another reason for wanting to visit the Ste.\n\nMarguerite.\n For several years now, the master angler has been trying to win a\n\nsort of bet he's had with the students who attend his Lew Beach, New York,\n\nfly-fishing school.\n It seems that one of them had trouble believing that the hook\n\nLee was using in a fly-tying demonstration \x96 a number 28 \x96 was big enough to\n\ncatch any sort of fish, let alone an Atlantic salmon. \n\n  Since then, Lee has managed to land a few grilse on similar, tiny\n\nflies, but never a salmon over 10 pounds.\n And he'd heard that the Ste. Marguerite, which has a number of\n\nlong, tranquil pools, could be the place to achieve that goal. \n\n  When I reached Bardsville, where we were quartered for our\n\nthree-day stay, I joined a group of people on the bank of Paquet Pool, and\n\nwatched an angler work a dry fly over a fish that refused to rise.\n Listening to the people who sat near me, sharing the warmth of the\n\nafternoon sun, I learned that the river was lower than it had been in the\n\npast 40 years.\n\n\n  Bardsville proved to be a marvelous place, reminding me of the\n\nprivate camps I've seen on the Grand Cascapedia.\n Its clean white cabins are snuggled in a nest of towering pines, and\n\nthe river flows gently just behind them.\n Some of the nicest pools on the Ste. Marguerite are located within a\n\nfew hundred yards of camp. \n\n  Later, I would learn that my analogy to the Cascapedia's camps\n\nwas not far off.\n The original Bardsville was built around 1872 by Willis Russell of\n\nQuebec and his partner from Philadelphia, Robert Powell.\n The two men eventually concluded a deal with a group of Americans,\n\nled by James Grant of New York, who founded the Ste. Marguerite Salmon\n\nClub in 1886. \n\n  Back then, Bardsville consisted of a single cabin, one of many\n\nbuilt along the Ste. Marguerite by Powell and Russell.\n It was common practice for club members and their guests to start a\n\nfishing trip at the club's main camp.\n Then, after a day's fishing, they would be poled upriver by canoe to\n\nthe next cabin, finishing their trip at Bardsville three or four days later.\n\n\n\n  It was, recalls Léonce Defour, who guided Lee when he\n\nfished the Northeast branch, a hard trip in the days before outboard\n\nmotors came on the scene.\n He wasn't kidding.\n Even with outboards, parts of our trip up the Northeast branch were\n\ndifficult.\n There were times when it seemed that the canoe was making no headway\n\nin the fast-flowing water, although the motor was going full out. \n\n  During dinner, our first night in camp, Lee had a chance to talk\n\nto the group about the Atlantic salmon, and what he believes must be done to\n\nsave the species.\n He's come to the conclusion that salmon should be given game-fish\n\nstatus by the Canadian government ( see Game-Fish Status a Must, ASJ\n\n1/90), a move that would effectively end the commercial fishery off\n\nNewfoundland.\n If the government decides, for whatever reason, that it can't stop\n\nthe netting, why not ban the commercial harvesting of large salmon?, asks\n\nLee.\n Let the commercial fishermen take nothing but grilse ( by regulating\n\nnet-mesh size), which would give the remaining, large salmon more chance to\n\nspawn.\n Maybe, just maybe, a lot of the country's rivers would regain a run\n\nof large fish, which Lee believes are genetically superior to grilse.\n\n\n\n  Over the next three days, Lee would return to this theme often,\n\ndoing his best to convince us that it would be the best course of action for\n\nthe government to follow.\n We, however, tended to be equally, if not more, interested in Lee's\n\nstories of his fishing exploits in Newfoundland, and in his little\n\nnumber 28 flies. \n\n  The next morning, I teamed up with John Randolph in section two\n\nof the river.\n Like many of the salmon streams managed by ZECs, the Ste. Marguerite\n\nis divided into controlled access and unlimited access water.\n On the controlled stretches of the river, access is limited to one or\n\ntwo rods per pool, while unlimited access water is open to any number of\n\nanglers ( who are expected to move through a pool on a rotational basis,\n\nallowing everyone a chance to fish).\n\n\n  With the growing popularity of salmon fishing, controlled access\n\nwater is highly sought after.\n Most ZECs, in an effort to ensure that every angler has an equal op\n\n<l> portunity to fish these pools, have developed a lottery reservation\n\nsystem.\n In the case of the Ste. Marguerite, a phone-in lottery is held during\n\nthe last week in March.\n\n\n  John and I, in section two, would be fishing in limited access\n\nwater, so we would have a pool more or less to ourselves.\n We made a quick stop at pool 28, but, seeing that André\n\nBoucher and Joan had established themselves there, we continued on down\n\nthe road to Bras D'Alain. \n\n  Our guide for the day was Rémi Gauthier, one of three\n\nGauthier brothers who are thus employed on the Ste. Marguerite.\n I was to fish first, as the junior member of the team.\n Following Rémi's advice, I selected a black and yellow fly\n\nthat Bill Bryson had tied for me in Nova Scotia, and waded into the river.\n\n\n\n  The fly was one of the smallest I had, but it was probably too\n\nbig, given the level of the water.\n I fished it the way I would have in a turbid pool, starting short and\n\nthen lengthening my line, even though the fish were easy to see in this\n\nclean, quiet water. \n\n  Soon, I had gotten as much line out as I was going to, which\n\nwasn't a lot.\n There was a bit of a wind blowing, the brush along the shore was a\n\nlittle close, and I was a little unsure of myself.\n But I was drifting my fly over fish \x96 they just weren't that\n\ninterested in it. \n\n  After I'd given Bill's creation a good workout, I turned the pool\n\nover to John, who tied on a little bomber and went to work himself.\n He's a man that has worked all the kinks out of his casting stroke.\n Wind, bushes, audience and all, his fly was always right where\n\nhe wanted it to be, working directly over the salmon that lay in the\n\nshade on the far side of the pool. \n\n  At first, the fish didn't react to John's offering.\n But he adjusted his casts, dropping his fly on the water with a\n\nslack line, and letting it float straight downstream.\n The fish liked this drag-free approach, and it wasn't long before\n\nJohn was fast to a lively grilse.\n He landed the fish quickly, enjoying its leaps and runs, and then\n\nreleased it. \n\n  Prior to this year, anglers in Quebec could only land one salmon\n\nper day on most Gaspé rivers and on some North Shore streams like the\n\nSte. Marguerite.\n John, then, was done fishing for the day.\n But he stayed at the pool, doing his best to see that I was casting\n\nover fish, and giving me some pointers on fishing the tiny bomber he'd\n\nlent me. \n\n  I came close, but I just couldn't get enough line out to put my\n\nfly over the main concentration of salmon.\n I even fell once, trying to wade out farther into the river. (\n Its bottom is rock covered for the most part, and slippery.)\n But I wasn't that deep at the time, and didn't go all the way in.\n\n\n\n  After about an hour, Rémi suggested we get his canoe, and\n\nfish farther down the pool.\n John, standing on the bank, had seen some good-sized salmon there,\n\nand said more seemed to be coming upriver. \n\n  The canoe was small, and a little unstable, so I did my\n\ncasting from a sitting position.\n I should have taken a fish, too, but my inexperience proved costly.\n In one case, I failed to see a small salmon coming after my fly \x96\n\nbeing intent on watching a 20-plus pounder that I was fishing over \x96 and I\n\npicked up my line too fast.\n\n\nfering, I had too much slack line out, and didn't get the hook set in time.\n\n\n\n  But it was an exciting morning, if frustrating.\n I'd had a rise, and I'd fished over a lot of salmon.\n That afternoon, before I headed out for the evening's fishing,\n\nJohn gave me a few casting pointers on the lawn outside the restaurant.\n\n\n\n  Despite John's expert coaching, and a lot of effort on the part\n\nof Rémi, who did his utmost to get me into a fish that evening, I\n\nwould not take a salmon on the first day.", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a10579ac-f599-4205-b6d2-95b7754947fc', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.906647+00:00', 'english_score': 0.984331488609314, 'non_english_score': 0.015668511390686035}
{'text': 'Silver\n\nmedallist Trudy Treslan\'s SheRa - queen of jungle routine performed at 1990\n\nSkate Canada gave her the opportunity to truely show her artistic side. Norm\n\nProft\'s ( inset) interpretative skating focuses on his personal concern about\n\nthe world\'s oppressed people, specifically those in South Africa under\n\napartheid.  \n\n  The Canadian Figure Skating Association continues to gain\n\nsupport for the interpretive event which Canada introduced in <l>\n\nternationally for the very first time during Skate Canada  in\n\nCornwall, Ont. \n\n  CFSA director-general David Dore had good reason to smile after\n\nlearning at the recent 1990 Skate Canada staged in Lethbridge, Alta., that\n\nInternational Skating Union officials are excited about the prospects\n\nfor the interpretive event. \n\n  Competitors have embraced the interpretive, originally called\n\nthe artistic event, since its inception because they feel it\'s a perfect\n\nvehicle to prepare them for professional show careers.\n They will welcome the news that the ISU officials are also coming on\n\nstream. \n\n  " Last year, they were lukewarm, because we were\n\nstruggling with what we were doing as well,"  said Dore. \n " This year, I think we\'ve got it better defined.\n\n\n  " a form of skating\n\nemphasizing the skater\'s ability to interpret music"  in a 2\n\n1/2-minute program.\n " selected for their value in enhancing\n\nthe choreographic interpretation of the music, rather than for their\n\ntechnical ability."  \n\n  Triple jumps and double Axels were not allowed this year, and\n\nDore anticipates further changes to the routines which are judged on\n\nmovements characterizing the mood and character of the music. \n\n  " Our hope was to try to see interpretive skating as a\n\nsemi-replacement for ( compulsory) figures,"  Dore said of\n\ninitiating the event at the beginning of the season, when figures were being\n\ntraced for the last time in ISU competitions. \n\n \n " I think maybe in the next four to six years it might start\n\nto move in.\n It will take that long.\n I think you\'ll see something like these pro competitions, where it\n\nmight become one aspect of the event, ( perhaps worth) 20 per cent ( of\n\nthe final mark)."   \n\n \n " It was interesting when we started, we were iffy about it.\n We limited it to single jumps, which could include an Axel.\n The ISU is asking us now to remove jumps altogether, which is where\n\nwe wanted to be when we started.\n They felt the people who were doing the jumping were unable to keep\n\nwith the theme."   \n\n  Coaches and judges at the closing banquet in Lethbridge had\n\nthoughts ranging from inclusion of the event at world championships as a\n\nseparate event, and perhaps altering the marking.\n The ideas about the scoring included having only one set of marks,\n\ninstead of the two used now, and asking actors or others from the arts scene\n\nto do the judging, rather than skating judges. \n\n  said Trudy\n\nTreslan, the silver medallist in Lethbridge\'s women\'s event, from\n\nBeechy, Sask. \n\n  " I don\'t know what they\'re going to do for\n\nregulations in the future, but I think you should be able to pick your own\n\ntheme, go from there, ( and) do it from the heart."   \n\n  " I think the audience can sit back and relax.\n We\'re doing it for their entertainment.\n It\'s not something that\'s supposed to be very stressful, with eight\n\n( jumping) elements in two minutes.\n It\'s more carefree to go out and do it from your heart and have\n\nfun."   \n\n  If the crowds are to be considered, they provide another reason\n\nfor keeping the event.\n They loved it in Lethbridge, especially when medallists such as\n\nTreslan, fellow Canadian Stephen Belanger, Daniel Weiss from Germany,\n\nAustralia\'s Cameron Medhurst and young American gold medallist Joanna Ng\n\nstrutted their stuff. \n\n  said\n\nTreslan, assessing the event won by a Belanger, with Weiss earning a silver\n\nmedal to go with his Cornwall gold and Medhurst securing the\n\nbronze.   \n\n  " I think that\'s important in the interpretive,\n\nto keep that uniqueness and not really set a pattern.\n I don\'t think they should start having one theme, because the\n\naudience could get a little tired ( of that)."   \n\n  "\n\none of the high points of the whole trip"  as he prepared for Skate\n\nAmerica in Buffalo, N.Y., and the Lethbridge visit by spending a month\n\ntraining at Edmonton\'s Royal Glenora with his good friend, two-time\n\nworld men\'s champion Kurt Browning. \n\n  Medhurst said.\n " It\'s more performing, less tension and stress, ( less)\n\naccent on the jumps.\n\n\n  He certainly managed to do the latter, wearing a costume and\n\nadding facial hair that left skaters who had seen him training in Edmonton\n\nunable to recognize him during the warm-up, before he gave his inter <l>\n\npretation of Fagin, from the movie  Oliver  . \n\n  " It\'s at the end of the movie, where he\'s deciding if\n\nhe\'s going to remain a bad guy, a thief and pickpocket, and lead this deceit\n\n<l> ful life, or change his ways, find a wife and become a good person,"\n\n said Medhurst, the personable eight-time Aussie champion. \n\n  " We did it last year as a Christmas show.\n Because it did so well, we kept it as an exhibition routine.\n Then when I got an invitation to Skate Canada, we thought we\'d use\n\nthat, because it fits in perfectly."   \n\n  Coach Belinda Trussell and Medhurst put together the program, and\n\nhe echoes the thoughts of others that it has a place in the sport. \n\n  " With the International Skating Union releasing the\n\nrestrictions on professionalism, we may see competitive skating go to\n\nthe artistic side of it similar to what they have in the United States in\n\nthat world professional championship,"  Medhurst said.\n " You get such a wide audience, television,\n\neverything, because it\'s so entertaining."   \n\n  " It\'s enjoyable to display emotion without\n\nhaving to worry about executing seven triple jumps.\n You can just do jumps where necessary, more on the entertainment,\n\nperforming side."   \n\n  " another aspect\n\nof skating,"  and she hopes it will be included on agendas at other\n\ninternational competitions. \n\n  " It\'ll open up doors and give a lot of other kids the\n\nopportunity to be seen internationally,"  Treslan said.\n " There\'s two different ways to skating - technical\n\nand artistic, and we can\'t forget the artistic side.\n\n\n  Her solo as SheRa, the queen of the jungle, was choreographed by\n\nKevin Cottam, who choreographed Browning\'s programs for his two world titles.\n The routine gave Treslan the chance to emulate her idol, 1988\n\nWinter Olympic gold medallist Katarina Witt of East Germany. \n\n  " She ( Katarina) can act out a story, as well as skate,"\n\n said Treslan. \n " I like the skater who can do both, instead of just\n\njump-jump-jump.\n But that\'s my way of thinking, because I\'m more artistic than a\n\ntechnical jumper."   \n\n  " Probably a technical jumper would disagree with me\n\nand say skating is a sport, and we go out there to do what we can do, keep\n\nthe arms at a constant level, one speed, and just jump."   \n\n \n\n  " A show will recognize someone with more artistic than\n\ntechnical ( ability), because that\'s basically what the public will\n\nappreciate more,"  she said. \n\n \n\nadding it\'s  " tiring, but a lot of fun."  \n\n  " It\'s set in the heart of the African jungle.\n It starts out where SheRa is awakened by the normal jungle sounds.\n In the midst of all the atmosphere of the jungle, she hears a lion.\n The first minute and a half of the program is what normally would\n\nhappen in a morning going through the jungle, keeping in mind that she\n\nhears this lion, and is looking out for the lion, doing maneuvres to avoid\n\nthe lion."   \n\n  " In all her attempts to keep away from the lion\n\nwhich she feels is fierce, she encounters some problems falling into\n\nrivers, going over cliffs, into some rapids. She pulls herself up the cliff\n\nby grabbing vines and ends up back ( at the top).\n That\'s where she hears the lion again.\n With all her strength and courage, she decides to hunt the beast\n\ndown.\n The last minute is the hunt for the beast and the actual struggle.\n\n\n  Treslan praised the Lethbridge Sportsplex crowd of about 5,200\n\nthat  " got me right into the jungle, which is what I had to do.\n It\'s difficult to get into that kind of mood, especially when the\n\nrest of the competition is happy and fun.\n\n\n  As she trained for Lethbridge, Treslan discussed the merits of\n\nthe event. \n\n  " It takes away from the daily pressures of the\n\ntriple-triple-triple routine,"  Treslan said, agreeing with\n\nMedhurst\'s sentiments.\n " I think it\'s enjoyable to sit back and watch someone\n\nperform a story-line on the ice.\n It\'s exhilarating and awesome to see someone do four\n\nrevolutions in the air or a triple-triple combination.\n But it\'s also neat to sit back and see someone in a costume, with\n\nthe music, acting out a story like real-life drama."   \n\n  " Figure skating is supposed to be beautiful,\n\npretty and it is a show.\n\n\n  Norm Proft of Langley, B.C., claimed the men\'s bronze in the\n\nCornwall artistic event.\n "\n\nwe\'re all getting older and closer to professional careers.\n\n\n  Proft still performs his routine, to a theme expressing concerns\n\nabout the world\'s oppressed, and specifically those in South Africa under\n\napartheid, as an exhibition number. \n\n  " Comedy is a lot more acceptable to an audience,"\n\n said Proft, who has seen Weiss and Belanger win with that approach\n\nin the first two competitions.\n " It\'s a lot easier to grasp.\n It\'s a lot easier to get the huge ovation for.\n It\'s hard to compete against a comedy number, especially when\n\nsomeone does it that well."   \n\n  " If you try something serious, people can appreciate\n\nit just as much.\n But it\'s a much more subdued, introspective appreciation.\n It\'s not the kind of thing that\'s going to get the big standing\n\novations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Born in southern Poland, Jerry Zawadzki earnestly began his\n\nfigure-skating career at the early age of six.\n Within a year of first lacing on his skates, Zawadzki was spending as\n\nmuch as three hours practising his skating daily. \n\n  The combination of dedicated practice and his desire to compete,\n\nmoved him rapidly up the competitive ranks.\n At age 12, Jerry made his debut in an international competition\n\nheld in Berlin, Germany. \n\n  Although singles skating was Jerry\'s specialty ( the former\n\nPolish national champion), he also competed in pairs. \n\n  " I have been very active in all sports although I have\n\ndedicated my life to figure skating,"  said Zawadzki  .\n\n  After completing high school, Jerry actively pursued his\n\neducation attending Poland\'s University of Warsaw studying in the faculty of\n\nphysical education, all the while continuing to seriously compete in figure\n\nskating.\n Upon graduating with a master\'s degree in physical education, he\n\ndecided to join  Holiday on Ice  performing with both the\n\nAmerican company and European contingent. \n\n  " In my travels with the ice show, I had the opportunity\n\nto visit many European countries and made many friends,"  he said.\n had a skating show on every\n\ncontinent, and after a year and a half, I transferred to the South American\n\nshow and then went on to tour with the North American troupe."  \n\n\n\n  After five years of continuous touring, that included several\n\ntrips to Canada, Zawadski chose Toronto, Ont., as his new home.\n He began teaching physical education at a North York high\n\nschool, and within six months, returned to figure skating in the capacity of\n\ncoach.   \n\n  Jerry has taught all age groups in both competitive and\n\nrecreational skating.\n Eventually, he joined skating organizations in the Unionville /\n\nMarkham ( Ontario) area.\n It was while working for these clubs that he noticed large numbers\n\nof skaters wearing poorly fitted skates.\n His knowledge in the art of skate sharpening persuaded him to start\n\nyet another new chapter in his life. \n\n  In 1976, Jerry opened a store called Jerry\'s Skating World along\n\nthe skate sharpening service.\n After two years of operation, he realized there was the\n\nadditional need for skating supplies, in remote areas across Canada. \n\n  " Almost one-third of the 1,400 skating clubs in Canada\n\nwere not accessible to specialized skating boutiques, and many club\n\nmembers had to travel long distances for basic supplies,"  Zawadzi\n\nadded.\n " Due to a lack of retail outlets in rural communities,\n\nwe supplied skating clubs directly.\n Over the years, we gradually developed a network of dealers to\n\ndistribute Jerry\'s merchandise country-wide."   \n\n  Today, Jerry\'s is a trend-setter in figure skating.\n A catalogue is published each year offering skate bags, scribes,\n\nguards, several lines of figure-skating outfits and a large assortment of\n\naccessories.\n The active input of Jerry\'s Skating World\'s experienced and\n\nknowledgeable staff of 15 enhances all of the store\'s creations as well as\n\nits reputation for good service and consumer satisfaction.    \n\n  Jerry\'s products are now sold in over 200 retail outlets across\n\nCanada and in over 100 stores throughout the United States.\n Appropriate to the company\'s name, Jerry\'s Skating World now\n\nhas representatives in Belgium, England, Finland, Denmark, Italy, Sweden,\n\nGermany, Switzerland, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan. \n\n  " I believe my company\'s success and growth are built on\n\nservice,"  said Zawadzki.\n " I have also been fortunate to have made good friends\n\nin Canada, who have guided me throughout my career and have encouraged\n\nme to strive for the best.\n It is these factors, along with the loyal support of our retailers,\n\nthat has made Jerry\'s Skating World what it is today."   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  While Canadian figure skating continues to flourish, it\n\nappears there could be extremely difficult times ahead in Europe. \n\n  The recent Skate Canada in Lethbridge, Alta., was another\n\nfinancial and artistic success, which accentuates the hardships that are\n\nexpected to arise in the Eastern Bloc because of the profound changes in the\n\npolitical climate there. \n\n  Competitions in Europe could be in jeopardy, from all\n\nindications.\n Coaches and athletes have also been left reeling because of the\n\nsignificant political differences. \n\n  A number of European coaches are reportedly already out of\n\nwork and having trouble finding suitable employment.\n And German unification has apparently left the parents of some East\n\nGerman skaters searching for jobs, which will be damaging financially and\n\npossibly psychologically to the world-ranked contingent affected. \n\n  " They\'re going to split apart financially in Europe,"\n\n Canadian Figure Skating Association director-general David Dore\n\nsaid as Skate Canada concluded.\n " We are solid in our television, in our rinkboards and\n\nlocations.\n We\'re looking at a five- or six-year plan when everyone else is not\n\neven in a one-year plan."   \n\n  The Skate Canada corporate aid was visible for all to see in\n\nLethbridge, with 12 companies contributing to arena board advertising.\n Six hundred volunteers and near-capacity crowds throughout the week\n\nin the 5,200-seat Sportsplex helped make the event an organizational success.\n\n\n\n  The 18th edition in London, Ont., next October, is likely to\n\nfollow suit, since it assists in launching the Winter Olympic season leading\n\nto Albertville, France, in February, 1992. \n\n  The lone negative from Skate Canada was the level of\n\ncompetition, with many international skaters choosing not to enter.\n But Dore explained that world women champion Jill Trenary, and the\n\noutstanding Soviet pairs and dance teams have decided to duck early-season\n\ninternational assignments to concentrate on domestic, European and\n\nworld championships.\n " because people are\n\nputting too much importance on that."   \n\n  " I don\'t favour trying to bring in one or two people\n\nwith high performance fees,"  said Dore, who has to be commended for\n\nthat philosophy because athletes lured by big bucks wouldn\'t necessarily\n\nperform up to their potential, as sports such as track and field have\n\ndiscovered. \n\n  " It ultimately doesn\'t help the field.\n It helps a few people.\n I don\'t think it helps skating.\n\n\n  Veteran U.S coach Frank Carroll talked about the other problems\n\nthe Europeans are encountering, while in Lethbridge with young women\'s\n\nsensation Joanna Ng of Woodland Hills, Calif.\n Ng, who only celebrated her 12th birthday Nov.8, struck gold in\n\nthe women\'s interpretative event and impressed all with her technical ability\n\nand poise. \n\n  " I think those Eastern Bloc countries are all going\n\nthrough terrible trauma right now,"  said Carroll, who coached\n\nChristopher Bowman to world men\'s silver and bronze medals in the last two\n\nyears, before they parted company following the 1990 world championships in\n\nHalifax, N.S., in March. \n\n  " I know the coaches are all looking for jobs.\n I feel very sorry for them, because they have to find means to\n\nsupport their families.\n The state obviously is not going to be able to provide them with\n\nthe salaries they\'ve had.\n They\'re finding out what it\'s like to really work for a living."\n\n  \n\n  " I teach with Soviet Irina Rodnina, the legend of\n\nskating in this day and age.\n When she came to Lake Arrowhead ( California) and watched me work,\n\nshe said \'I can\'t believe how hard or how many hours you work.\'\n I spend about 10 hours a day, five days a week giving lessons."\n\n  \n\n  North American professionals spend long hours ar the rink, often\n\nworking split shifts, because their students pay them by the lesson under our\n\nfree-enterprise system.\n Such was not the case for Rodnina, who set the standard for pairs\n\nskating with 10 world championships and three Olympic gold medals, or others\n\nlike her. \n\n  " I guess in the Soviet Union she ran a college course,\n\ntaught maybe five hours a day at the maximum, received a salary, had a lot of\n\npaperwork, probably trained about 10 students totally,"  said\n\nCarroll.\n " I think many of them just trained a few students and\n\ngot paid by the state to do it."   \n\n  It\'s a major adjustment for the Eastern Bloc coaches to learn\n\nnew work habits.\n But it could be more devastating for skaters whose parents don\'t\n\nhave jobs and now have to pay for lessons, as they pursue positions at the\n\nworld championships. \n\n  Unification has provided the German Figure Skating Federation\n\nwith the advantage of an expanded team for the March 12 to 17, 1991\n\nworld championships at the Olympic Hall in Munich, Germany.\n But the International Skating Union\'s decision to permit four women,\n\nthree men, three pairs and two dance couples might not be beneficial if\n\nworld-ranked East German skaters are hit especially hard by the changes which\n\nhave left them minus deutschmarks.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'c7913b27-a2f5-4334-9243-23d916a09cac', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.907907+00:00',

{'text': 'YAMAHA\'S NEW SNOWSPORT PROVIDES FULL-SIZE GRINS IN A PIPSQUEAK\n\nPACKAGE. \n\n  Snow machines that are low in price and high in fun quotient have\n\nbecome a specialty with Yamaha.\n Two seasons back the company introduced its SnoScoot, which was\n\npowered by a drive system from a Riva scooter.\n Like its motorcycling equivalent, the SnoScoot was designed to be a\n\nlightweight, low-cost way to enjoy a recreational activity without eating up\n\na lot of disposable income. \n\n  The little 80 cc SnoScoot, frequently maligned by " real"\n\nsnowmobilers, has a top speed under 50 km/h and can thrash through a foot of\n\nfresh powder with ease.\n It weighs just 100 kg ( 220 lb), and is even available with electric\n\nstart. \n\n  Although not part of Yamaha\'s 1990 line, the SnoScoot is still\n\nwidely available as a non-current. \n\n  Many of those who bought the original SnoScoot wished for more\n\npower, and Yamaha has responded with an all-new machine that incorporates the\n\nfun quotient of the    SnoScoot   with a\n\nbigger helping of horsepower and better handling. \n\n  The 1990 SnoSport is longer, wider and more powerful than its\n\npredecessor.\n Its engine has grown from a six-horsepower 80 cc single to an\n\n11-horsepower 123 cc single.\n The transverse leafspring used to suspend the SnoScoot\'s skis has\n\nbeen replaced by a coil-over-shock independent strut suspension that offers\n\n12 cm ( 4.7 in.) of travel and excellent handling manners. \n\n  A bigger 18.6-litre fuel tank should give a range of more than\n\n100 km on a tankful.\n Another improvement is a new Monocross rear suspension with 15 cm ( 6\n\nin.) of travel.\n While bigger than the SnoScoot in virtually every way, the SnoSport\n\nis only 15 kg heavier, according to Yamaha.\n On the down side, the improvements have resulted in a &dollar;700\n\nprice increase; suggested list price for the SnoSport is &dollar;2,549. \n\n  During a testing session last spring we found the new mini Yamaha\n\nto be a blast to ride flat-out ... which, of course, is a modest rate\n\ncompared with other full-size snowmobiles.\n The upright motorcycle-like seating arrangement was a pleasant change\n\nfrom the conventional sit-on-your-tailbone seating of most sleds.\n )\n\nyour legs actually become part of the shock absorbing motion and help protect\n\nyour lower back from taking direct hits from stutter bumps and sharp moguls.\n And, with a little practice, you can almost make the SnoSport whirl\n\naround in its own width, like a freewheel bicyclist. \n\n  The newest Yamaha snow scooter comes standard with electric start\n\nin either red with black seat or white with red seat.\n The polyethylene bodywork is virtually indestructible and neatly\n\ncovers the machine\'s skeletal underpinnings.\n It\'s a nifty snow machine for starters, and a fun and frisky respite\n\nfrom heavy-metal machines for even experienced snowmobilers.  \n\n\n\n\n  Each of the Big Four manufacturers has one entry-level machine to\n\nappeal to beginners or cost-conscious snowmobilers. \n\n  Yamaha, in addition to the SnoSport, offers the more conventional\n\nBravo, which has a 246 cc single-cylinder fan-cooled engine and a claimed dry\n\nweight of just 136 kg ( 300 lb).\n Standard features include Autolube oil injection, CD ignition and\n\nadjustable handlebars.\n It\'s a satisfying machine for small- to average-size adults, but way\n\ntoo small for tall or heavy riders.\n\n\n  Ski-Doo also has a couple of cute entries in the\n\njust-getting-started category.\n The Safari Citation is similar to the Bravo in that it\'s equipped\n\nwith a 248 cc single-cylinder fan-cooled engine and measures just 241 x 85 cm\n\nin length and width ( the Bravo\'s dimensions are 237 x 87 cm).\n\n\n  One of our all-time favorites in the Ski-Doo line is the\n\nvenerable Elan.\n Unlike the Citation, with its conventional slide-rail rear\n\nsuspension, the Elan uses bogie wheels at the back end.\n Motive power is provided by a tried-and-true 250 cc single-cylinder\n\nfan-cooled Rotax engine that just chugs along mile after mile.\n This little sled is slightly less expensive than the Citation, at\n\n&dollar;2,899, but probably can cover more off-trail territory with its\n\nlarger 38.1 x 289.6 cm track.\n For beginners, the Elan is a wise choice because of its reliability\n\nand  . \n\n  Another nimble lightweight is the Polaris Star, which is a\n\nfull-size machine with a 244 cc single-cylinder fan-cooled engine that seems\n\nto live forever and operate on little more than gasoline fumes. \n\n  The nifty thing about the Star is its direct-drive transmission.\n Considered the wave of the future in the early 1980s, direct drive\n\nwas pioneered by John Deere in the long-    forgotten\n\n  Spitfire, and brought up to snuff in the Polaris Cutlass series.\n The Star is a direct descendant of the Cutlass, and the chassis the\n\nStar has inherited allows the engine to sit low up front, which provides\n\nincreased stability from a lower centre of gravity. \n\n  Standard Star features include the modern necessities of CD\n\nignition and oil injection.\n Suggested list price is &dollar;2,849, certainly a bargain for a\n\nfull-size machine. \n\n  Arctic Cat has its own venerable version of value, the Jag 340.\n It\'s a fuel-stingy full-size machine with all the right stuff for\n\nfirst-timers, including the only twin-cylinder engine in the class.\n Its 339 cc fan-cooled powerplant offers significantly better power\n\nthan the competition, but at a price: the Jag 340 is the most expensive of\n\nthe bunch at &dollar;4,039. \n\n  If you plan to hold on to your entry-level machine for a few\n\nseasons, the Jag 340 begins to make a lot of sense.\n While it has the standard oil injection and CD ignition, the Jag can\n\nalso be dressed up with goodies such as speedometer, tachometer, low-oil\n\nwarning light, handlebar warmers, high windshield, electric start and reverse\n\ngear. \n\n  Any of these inexpensive snowmobiles will provide many seasons of\n\nreliable running.\n But if this is your first purchase, or you\'re buying for a younger\n\nrider, remember to think ahead.\n Consider what you might want in a snowmobile in the future, and think\n\nabout whether you\'ll need a down-size or full-size chassis.\n With proper planning, the entry-level machine you buy now will\n\nprovide years of service and enjoyment in winters to come.  \n\n\n\n\n\n  For the past few seasons, Arctic Cat\'s Pantera has epitomized\n\nluxury in a single-seater snowmobile.\n Billed as the " Catillac" of sleds, Arctco\'s liquid-cooled cruiser\n\nhas definitely had the edge in one-upmanship. \n\n  Heading into a new decade, Arctic Cat has upgraded its\n\nsolo-luxury-touring sled to help stave off the stiff competition in this\n\nincreasingly hot market category. \n\n  Cat\'s major competition comes from another Minnesota-based\n\nsnowmobile maker, Polaris.\n The company\'s Indy 500 Classic virtually matches Cat\'s Pantera\n\nfeature for feature, but adds an extra dollop of performance to boot.\n The Pantera is based on more sedate trail-touring power systems,\n\nwhile the 1990 Indy 500 Classic gets its horses from the Indy 500, which in\n\nracing trim won the third annual Thunder Bay to St. Paul, Minn., endurance\n\nrace last season. \n\n  Not to be left out of the fray in the solo-luxury-touring class,\n\nYamaha chips in with its new Phazer II LE, which is based on the Phazer II,\n\nand also the Exciter LE, which is equipped with the liquid-cooled engine from\n\nthe top-of-the-line Exciter.\n The original Exciter is the sled that started the surge in popularity\n\nof 500 cc trail-performance models.\n Just a step below the 650 cc machines, snowmobiles such as the\n\nExciter were usually considered more atuned to performance than to luxury,\n\nuntil both Yamaha and Polaris started to equip them with deluxe features.\n\n\n\n  Ski-Doo, which has two nifty independent front suspensions for\n\n1990, has chosen to let its all-new Safari series lead the way in the\n\nsolo-luxury-touring class.\n The fan-cooled Safari LXE is designed to replace the strut-suspended\n\nStratos and Voyageur models of the past few seasons.\n Although not quite as decked out as the sleds it replaces, we think\n\nthe new Safari LXE is a vast improvement in terms of ride and overall trail\n\nperformance.\n It\'s also the lowest-priced machine in its class, while also offering\n\nmost of the same features as the competition. \n\n  All of the above-mentioned models come standard with electric\n\nstart.\n Only the Arctic Cat Pantera offers reverse gear as standard\n\nequipment, though reverse is an option on the Classic.\n Performance levels vary too.\n Yamaha\'s Exciter LE has the largest engine at 569 cc, though the\n\nClassic delivers nearly the same punch from its liquid-cooled 488 cc twin.\n Cat\'s Pantera has dropped its 440 twin, which was once used in the\n\nlong-deceased Scorpion Sidewinder, in favor of a lightweight, 60-ish\n\nhorsepower Suzuki-built 440 cc twin.\n This is the same engine found in the all-new Prowler.\n Bombardier opted for the tried-and-true fan-cooled 437 cc twin for\n\nthe Safari LXE, an engine that provides the same level of performance as the\n\n496 cc fan-cooled twin under the hood of last year\'s Voyageur. \n\n  The Big Four sled makers have given the rider who\'s looking for a\n\none-up luxury machine a tough choice to make for the 1990 season.\n Zip up your suit and get ready for a quick ride on all of the\n\ncontenders. \n\n\n  No doubt about it, the Pantera is certainly the " Catillac" of\n\nsnowmobiling.\n With few exceptions, the Pantera is a machine that coddles is\n\noccupant with well-thought-out features and strong performance. \n\n  Our only real complaint with this Cat is that we\'d like a bigger\n\nengine, which would make it more directly comparable to the Polaris Indy 500\n\nClassic.\n The new 440 cc twin developed for the Prowler is adequate in the\n\nheavier Pantera, but we\'d have preferred the more potent 530 cc twin that\'s\n\nused in the EXT, which offers mileage akin to a Cougar and performance on par\n\nwith the other 500 cc liquid-cooled sport sleds.\n However, its lacking at top end is more than compensated for by\n\nexcellent smoothness and comfort. \n\n  The Pantera is the first luxury snowmobile to offer reverse gear\n\nas standard equipment.\n The lightweight reversing system is incredibly simple, easy to\n\noperate, and has now been duplicated ( as much as patents will allow) by\n\nPolaris, which offers it as an option on its Indy 500 Classic.\n We think reverse gear is a must on the standard-equipment list of any\n\nluxury snowmobile. \n\n  For 1990 the Pantera also gets the same inboard-shock rear\n\nsuspension that was fitted to the Wildcat, EXT and Cougar last season.\n We put more than 3,000 kilometres on an EXT last winter, and\n\nabsolutely fell in love with the 19 cm ( 7.5 in.) of travel and smooth ride,\n\nwhich seems to get better as speed increases.\n At the front is Cat\'s long-travel A-frame independent suspension with\n\nalmost 18 cm ( 7 in.) of travel.\n For luxury touring, this combination is hard to beat.\n Our pre-production Pantera was set up a bit on the stiff side during\n\nour pre-season riding session, but softening the suspension is a simple\n\nmatter of resetting the eyebolt adjusters to take in or let out suspension\n\ntension. \n\n  The dappled grey seat - a throwback to the original spotted\n\nPanther seats of the late 1960s is a favorite when it comes to function and\n\nfit, if not esthetics.\n We\'ve always enjoyed the added security provided by the high back\n\nlip.\n This El Tigre carryover found immediate favor with Cat fans when\n\nArctco\'s engineers changed from the bench styling of the early Wildcats back\n\nto this design.\n For 1990 seat foam and construction have been upgraded with greater\n\nattention paid to quality control.\n Interestingly, Polaris has adopted a similar program this season,\n\ngoing so far as to add a layer of plastic around the foam before placing the\n\ncover on the seat, which should keep moisture from creeping into the seat\n\nfoam and freezing. \n\n  Both the Pantera and the Indy 500 Classic offer rearview mirrors\n\nas standard equipment.\n Frankly, we prefer the spring-loaded Polaris mirrors over the\n\nstationary Cat mirrors because they are less prone to breakage.\n Having ridden with and without these accessories, though, we find\n\nmirrors to be a decided plus on the trail.\n If you don\'t have to turn around to look behind you every have so\n\noften, you are a less distracted, safer rider.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'e4c2ca89-7434-4fef-afee-9e4e8cf2d894', 'added':

{'text': 'The US winter run of rodeos this past month has been rewarding for\n\nseveral members of the Canadian contingent making their way across the\n\nwarmer portion of the North American continent.\n If you check the World Standings on Page 8 you will find many Canadian\n\ncowboys well up in the listing. \n\n  Water Valley, AB cowboy, Mark Nugent\'s Denver, Colorado\n\nwinnings from January have helped keep him in 3rd place in the calf roping.\n Duane Daines has continued to come on strong with another big win\n\nat    Fort   Worth, Texas, and he is holding\n\ndown 3rd for the PRCA saddle bronc event.\n It may be early in the season, but all looks promising for that\n\ndesired position to be going into the National Finals Rodeo in Las Vegas next\n\nDecember. \n\n\n  There are Canadians on the payoff sheets in each of the five major\n\nevents for the Southwestern Exposition and Live-stock Show and Rodeo, held\n\nJanuary 19 through February 4.\n Daines came out of it with &dollar;3,676 when he split 1st in both the\n\nfirst and third go-rounds.\n In addition to Daines, Rod Warren ( &dollar;332), Mel Coleman (\n\n&dollar;332), Rod Hay ( &dollar;860) and Guy Shapka ( &dollar;73) all came\n\nout of the saddle bronc riding with some funds. \n\n  Darrell Cholach shared the high marking for the bareback event\n\nwith an 82, placing 1st in the first go for &dollar;2,132.\n He then added &dollar;781 for 5th/6th in the average.\n Shawn Vant of Millet also squeezed in for some pocket money in the\n\nsecond go-round. \n\n  The only bull rider to show up was Gerald James of Williams\n\nLake, BC with a score of 78 to take 2nd/3rd in the second go and\n\n&dollar;2,203. \n\n  At the timed event end - - in calf roping Gerald Willsie came out\n\nof it with &dollar;7,241 with a 1st in the short-go, 2nd in the average,\n\nand a split for 8th in the second go-round.\n Micheal Daines wasn\'t far behind at total earnings of &dollar;3,173\n\nwith a 4th in the short-go, 6th in the second go, and 7th/8th in the average.\n For the steer wrestler\'s, John Gibson of Hardisty, AB, made a snap\n\n<l> py 4.1 run in the second go to take the 1st place winnings of\n\n&dollar;4,006. \n\n\n  Rod Hay scored an 80 in the first go for top money and ended up\n\n5th/6th in the average with total points of 144 for a &dollar;1,687 pay\n\ncheque.\n Guy Shapka brought out &dollar;868 from the Black Hills Stock Show\n\nand Rodeo held January 26 through February 4 with a 3rd placing, also in\n\nthe first go-round. \n\n  In calf roping, Cliff Williamson was 3rd in the second go and\n\ncollected &dollar;599, while Trish Brown ran a 13.22 in the ladies barrel\n\nracing for &dollar;240. \n\n  Val Marie, SK, bull rider, Trevor Walker was 72 points to place\n\n2nd in the short-go and was 3rd in the average with 141 points for a total\n\npayout of &dollar;1,824. \n\n\n  Scottsdale, AZ on February 1-4 saw only saddle bronc competitors\n\nto the pay window.\n Chris Andersen of Rocky Mountain House, AB, was 2nd with a 75 score\n\nto earn &dollar;969, while Mel Coleman picked up &dollar;484 for 3rd/4th, and\n\nDenny Hay was in 7th/8th position on the chart. \n\n\n  Blaine Pederson twisted one quick in a time of 3.6 seconds for\n\nfirst placing in the second go-round of the Southwestern International\n\nRodeo running from February 2-11.\n He finished up 5th in the steer wrestling average and gathered\n\n&dollar;2,587. \n\n  Duane Daines was 76 points in the saddle bronc event to\n\nreceive &dollar;202, and Robin Burwash made &dollar;270 in the bareback\n\nriding with a 75 point ride. \n\n\n  Mark Roy of Priddis, AB collected &dollar;9,670 in two rodeos to\n\nbring his season earnings to &dollar;10,584, placing him in the PRCA steer\n\nwrestling standings at 6th.\n At the Dixie National Rodeo, February 8-14, Roy gathered\n\n&dollar;2,480 with a 3rd/4th in the first go with a time of 3.9 seconds, and\n\n2nd in the average with an 8.3 on 2 head. \n\n  Blaine Pederson also accumulated &dollar;1,142 in steer wrestling\n\nwinnings for 5th/6th in the first go-round and 4th in the average.\n Paynton, SK cowboy, Todd Boggust was 4.3 in the second go to\n\nearn &dollar;428 for 5th/6th. \n\n  Rookie, Bruce Pierson split 2nd/3rd in the bareback with 81\n\npoints for &dollar;1,814. \n\n  To represent the calf ropers, Cliff Williamson was 4th and\n\npicked up &dollar;769, while Duane Dailies placed in the saddle bronc riding.\n\n \n\n\n\n by Dwayne Erickson\n\n  Steve Dunham is shivering through an Alberta winter for the first\n\ntime in 14 years. \n\n  The four-time Canadian bareback riding champion admits he\'s\n\nturning a corner on his rodeo career - one that undoubtedly will someday\n\ncarry him into the Hall of Fame. \n\n  says\n\nthe Turner Valley cowboy, Canada\'s career earnings leader in professional ro\n\n<l> deo.\n " The travel\'s getting to me.\n I\'m not as gung-ho to go the distances anymore.\n\n\n  Let\'s not use the word " " retirement" " here\n\nbecause Dunham still has a great deal of mileage left in him.\n It\'s just that his priorities have changed.\n The National Finals and its &dollar;2 million-plus purse is no longer\n\nthe pot at the end of his rainbow. \n\n  been just\n\nout of it the last couple of years,"  he   \n\nacknowledges   . \n chase it\n\nlike before.\n pick and choose."\n\n  \n\n \n\n  " We\'ve got a pretty good horse training business here at\n\nhome and my dad\'s getting to the point where he shouldn\'t be breaking\n\ncolts,"  says Dunham.\n\n\n \'ve got to   do my end."  \n\n  This marks the first winter since 1976 - his first year as a pro\n\n- that Dunham has missed the U.S. winter rodeos. \n\n  " The last 13 years I\'ve gone to about 125 rodeos a\n\nyear,"  says Dunham.\n " I\'m cutting that down to 70 or less.\n I\'ll go to Reno ( June) and probably Cheyenne ( July) and maybe the\n\nBig Four ( in the northwestern U.S. in September).\n\n\n  He stuck his name in for Houston and Tucson in mid-February but\n\ndidn\'t draw anything strong enough to entice him out of hibernation so he\n\nstayed home. \n\n  " I\'ve been real busy training horses, riding all\n\nday long and playing hockey on weekends,"  Dunham reveals. \n\n\nease around here and see how things go."   \n\n  He\'s only missed being on the trail when he\'s received phone\n\ncalls from his former travelling partners, Robin Burwash and Bill Boyd. \n\n  he\n\nadmits. \n " I wish I could be in both spots.\n I always enjoyed the winter rodeos.\n They were like holidays.\n You don\'t travel that hard and you had time to watch ( baseball)\n\nspring training, go to Disneyland and tour around.\n But the last couple of winters I was wishing I was back here\n\nhandling those things at home."   \n\n \n\n  " I want to concentrate on my roping and get something\n\ndone in the All-Around,"  he says.\n " I\'ve had a roping horse for a few years but he\'s not ready.\n get roping off him.\n I\'ve never been home long enough to practise and finish him off."\n\n  \n\n  Dunham has a nagging feeling that if he\'d had his own horse, he\n\nmight have qualified for the All-Around more often and maybe even won it\n\nduring one of his championship ( bareback riding) years. \n\n  Ironically, in the four years he won the bareback title, 1979,\n\n1981, 1982 and 1988, he failed to cash three roping runs during the season to\n\nqualify for the All-Around.\n Of the other 10 years Dunham went to the Canadian Finals, he was\n\nan All-Around qualifier seven times. \n\n  Only Mel Coleman has qualified for the All-round more times -\n\nnine - since the advent of the Canadian Finals in 1974.\n And he\'s gone on to capture a record-tying five of the coveted\n\nbuckles. \n\n  Tom Bews was also a CFR All-Around qualifier seven times, as was\n\nLynn Jensen.\n Bews was a five-time winner.\n Jensen, like Dunham to this point in his career, never got to the\n\nthrone room.  \n\n\n\n\n  It has been six years since a Pro cowboy has had a reason to go\n\nthe Camrose, Alberta.\n In 1984, due to financial difficulties, the Camrose Kinsmen Club\n\nhosted their final C.P.R.A. sanctioned rodeo. \n\n  On March 23 through 25 of 1990 top cowboys and cowgirls from\n\nCanada and the US will once again make their way to the Camrose Pro Rodeo.\n The Camrose Regional Exhibition, which is an agricultural\n\nsociety similar to the Edmonton Northlands and Medicine Hat Stampede\n\norganizations, is excited to be hosting this new event. \n\n  Not unfamiliar with rodeo activities, some of the 12-member board\n\nwere involved with the Kinsmen Club\'s rodeo, and the group have held\n\nrodeo events over the past several years.\n " Just about everyone on the committee has been involved in\n\nrodeo at one time or another, or has competed in rodeo,"  says their\n\nOperations Manager, Larry Werner. \n\n  They have hosted the Canadian Oldtimers Rodeo Finals, the\n\nCanadian Team Roping Finals, and the past five years of the LRA Finals.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n  Spring of each new year brings with it hopes of a prosperous\n\nrodeo season.\n We look forward to our " career year", and everything we do is\n\ndirected towards that goal.\n It is human nature to become the best that we can be, and in the\n\nWorld of Rodeo it is no different. \n\n  One way many rodeo competitors pursue this goal is to\n\nimprove their skills by attending a rodeo event school instructed\n\nby a top contestant they admire.\n The instructor doesn\'t have to be a World or Canadian Champion, but\n\nsomeone that the student can understand and learn from. \n\n  Fifteen to twenty years ago these rodeo schools were very few and\n\nthe young cowboys had to learn " the hard way."\n This was often not the " right way" and involved many years and bad\n\nexperiences to learn what can now be explained in a few short days.\n\n\n\n  1978 Canadian Bull Riding Champion, Don Johansen claims he and\n\nhis brother\'s, Jack and Bruce  " never did learn the right way when we\n\nwere kids."  \n\n  They started their boys steer riding schools in 1974 at the\n\nfamily place in Hussar, AB, with the idea of helping the younger\n\ncowboys eliminate a lot of the injuries they had experienced. \n\n  " There are 100 ways to get hurt in riding steers, and\n\nriding bulls,"  states Johansen,and  " the two most important\n\nthings we teach at our schools is getting on the animal, and getting off\n\nthe animal." \n These are the areas where he feels most of the injuries in\n\nsteer riding and bull riding come from. \n\n  Don also affirms that if kids learn the right way to start with,\n\nthe bad habits that are difficult to break can be avoided. \n\n  " Jim Freeman and Bob Hartell started putting on bull\n\nriding schools at our place and that where we, as brothers, learned a lot -\n\nthrough schools,"  Don expressed.\n " That\'s why I really stress that kids go to schools every\n\nyear."  \n\n  The Johnson brothers started their first bull riding school in\n\n1979 and they have held steer riding and bull riding schools every year\n\nsince. \n\n  To help alleviate injuries to students they incorporated Ryan\n\nByrne into their schools with a bullfighting school as well.\n This proved beneficial not only to the riding event students,\n\nbut has also produced some promising bullfighters. \n\n  As in any sport, rodeo has progressed tremendously as the\n\ncompetitors learn new and better techniques to perform more effectively in\n\ntheir events.\n It changes so quickly, and through practice and the aid of video\n\ncameras, new methods are being discovered constantly.\n This knowledge can best be passed on to others through rodeo\n\nschools. \n\n  " nobody can make a bull rider in four\n\ndays.\n What we try to stress at our schools is the safety.\n Make sure the kid can make it down the road, and if he puts some try\n\ninto it, he\'s going to make a bull rider." \n " to be a bull rider you\'ve got to give\n\n110%, and that\'s the difference between a bull rider and a Canadian\n\nChampion."  \n\n  Those that are serious about the sport - whether it be in the\n\nhopes of making it their career, or to pursue it as a hobby - many will\n\nattend at least one school each year.\n Some go to different instructors with the belief that they can learn\n\nsomething from everyone.\n Others prefer to go back to the same one year after year\n\nbecause they feel what a particular instructor is teaching is working for\n\nthem, and they want to build on that. \n\n  " We try to teach the basics, so they can go on and\n\nride,"  Johansen explains.\n\n\ngressed, then we advance them and get working more on their style of\n\nriding, and putting them on rougher stock."   \n\n  Mental preparation is as important as the physical conditioning\n\nprior to competition.\n The positive reinforcement that comes with increased knowledge\n\ngained from schools give students more of the confidence that is so important\n\nfor a successful performance.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '3cf44f99-725d-4315-9c16-f23bedfedfd0', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.911216+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9786459803581238, 'non_english_score': 0.02135401964187622}
{'text': 'It is almost impossible to believe, but a year ago the Ottawa\n\nCitizen made a mistake.\n\n\n  As Mother and other readers of this column know, the decade begins\n\nonly tomorrow, just 10 years before the 21st century starts.\n That conclusion rests on the reasonable assumption that no one\n\nacknowledged living in " year nothing" and that somebody or other started\n\ncounting at " " one" " . \n\n  I wish this column to rectify any resulting confusion, but this\n\nmay be an impossible task. \n\n  And yet, it is a time to be astonished by what has happened to us\n\nin this decade.\n Shortly before it began - on May 20, 1980 - Quebec had voted almost 60\n\nper cent against even a flirtation with sovereignty.\n An even higher percentage of Quebeckers convinced themselves that\n\nseparatism had disappeared in our time, to be replaced by the new fashion of\n\nentrepreneurship.\n\n\n  Before the end of the decade, not only have separatists been\n\nenjoying their new lease on life, but they have finally spread the doctrine\n\nof inevitability.\n This has been their greatest tactical triumph.\n It has created the bandwagon effect, now persuading even Quebec\n\nanglophones to declare early for the winning side.\n Local separatists find their usual support among unthinking Canadians\n\nfar beyond the frontiers of Quebec. \n\n  The search for the scapegoats who created this mess for Canada\n\nhas also started, and it will have no end.\n Since you insist, we will share two of our own prejudices with you,\n\nunderlining that they are not necessarily the most important factors, but\n\nthey are being little recognized  .\n\n  Jacques Parizeau was the first to realize the critical importance\n\nto his separatist cause of our economic union with the United States.\n The Quebec business community, growing enormously in power, was the\n\nfail-safe of Confederation at the beginning of the decade.\n Whatever the final judgment of the so-called free-trade agreement, it\n\nquickly robbed federalism of its main support in Quebec.\n By the end of the decade, business had moved to a position that spans\n\nneutrality and an unexpected desire to adventure. \n\n  The other scapegoat is the press that gets blamed for everything.\n George Bain, probably Canada\'s most experienced and insightful media\n\nwatcher, has drawn attention to the knee-jerk assumption of most broadcast\n\nand print journalists that, in any dispute from immigration to Indians to\n\nozone, government must always be wrong.\n Then the press complains about the public cynicism towards\n\npoliticians and politics that has been largely created by journalists who\n\nprefer prejudices to homework.\n The law of averages must surely prevent even our present prime\n\nminister from being wrong all the time. \n\n  Maybe Meech Lake was not the answer to our constitutional woes,\n\nbut the galloping cynicism towards politicians created in Canada a mindset\n\nthat encouraged the rejection of just about any solution.\n If the words were not wrong, the process was wrong.\n The se1f-destructive consequence of our extreme cynicism towards our\n\npolitical system is a readiness to throw out every baby that comes in a\n\ngovernment bath.\n For Quebeckers, public cynicism toward political leaders greatly\n\neased the path to separatism.\n For other Canadians, the same cynicism made almost any political\n\nsolution unacceptable - except the unthinkable solution. \n\n  Even if the press has largely destroyed faith in our political\n\ninstitutions and in the men and women who run them, it is never too late to\n\ntry being sensible.\n Democratic governments are rarely 100-per-cent wrong, 100-per-cent\n\nstupid or 100-per-cent dishonest.\n As you always taught us, Mother, we should never question human\n\nmotives, but only the actions that flow from them. \n\n  Whether people are fighting for federalism, for Quebec\n\nindependence or simply for a workable world, a little mutual trust and\n\nfriendly respect could be useful.\n Some objective analysis of what system looks most promising to human\n\nbeings would be refreshing on every continent. \n\n  The first days of a new decade seem like a good time to start.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n  The real art of being merry lies in making the right comparisons.\n The path to happiness of the season does not lead us back to the\n\nimagined joys of Dickensian Christmases, or even the twisted memories of our\n\nown lost youth.\n Whether we admit it or not, both were full of terminal hypertension\n\nand stress you would not believe. \n\n  No, to be merry, we must think of the things that we can be\n\ndemonstrably happy about.\n Since it may seem to be a dwindling list, we would like to offer our\n\nhelp in making your Christmas really jolly, if not downright laughable, by\n\nrecalling some upbeat facts of life. \n\n  First, let us all rejoice, that we are one year closer to the\n\nnext federal election than we were last Christmas.\n\n\n  We in the Outaouais rejoice that we all have real mayors, good or\n\nbad.\n If God had not been with us, She might have put us in Ottawa where\n\nthe mayor reportedly works for a developer and drops by City Hall to pick up\n\na second cheque. \n\n  We can also be happy that economic union ( which the government\n\ncalls " " free trade" " ) has not yet been completely\n\neffective.\n Well, it may already have paved the way for our separation from all\n\nof Canada, and made a few hundred thousand people jobless, but, we are told,\n\nthe real results are yet to come.\n\n\n\n  We are not yet a world-class city ( like Scranton).\n We in the Outaouais are optimistic that we will never depend on bush\n\nleague baseball to swell our pride, but we admit that we are behind in our\n\ncrime.\n Frankly, our murder rate is disgracefully low in the international\n\nscheme of things.\n Washington is nudging 500 murders far this year, while the whole of\n\nour national capital region can find only 10.\n That includes Gatineau\'s two terminations with extreme prejudice, but\n\nnot a single one in Cantley - yet.\n\n\n  Don\'t be depressed by our lagging mayhem.\n With the iron will of the Tory gun lobby, and the spaghetti-like\n\ndetermination of our minister of justice, we\'ll soon be on a level playing\n\nfield with the Americans. \n\n  Meanwhile, let us be happy that no one has been completely killed\n\nduring discussions at the councils of La Peche or Val des Monts.\n\n\n  The sewage seeping into the Gatineau from the unrepentant\n\nhouseholders of Chelsea has slowed to a trickle.\n Swimming in the river should be excellent between now and late April.\n\n\n\n  We will not have a theme park at Mont Cascades.\n .\n Of course there\'s talk of having one in the lovely Meech Creek\n\nValley, perhaps combined with the largest garbage dump this side of the\n\nSparks Street Mall.\n But we have to put our garbage somewhere, don\'t we?\n Especially when the Outaouais collects no blue boxes outside the City\n\nof Gatineau. \n\n  We don\'t have to worry about the country\'s future.\n We have that from no less an authority than federal Transport\n\nMinister Benoit Bouchard.\n Questioned about the timing of his &dollar;300-million transfer of\n\nassets into Montreal\'s space agency, he said he wanted  " to manage\n\nthe country of today."  \n\n  Finally, all the church-going people of the Outaouais have a\n\nspecial reason to be happy.\n They do not live in Ontario where a mayor, whose name is a household\n\nword wherever it is known, was apparently discussing matters of    sex   :  " I\'m not interested in that kind of thing,"\n\n he was quoted as saying.  \n\n\n  Here in the Outaouais, people are still interested.\n\n\n  And that wish goes from us to all of you - even to those who live\n\nin Ontario, Canada.  \n\n\n\n\n  Just before the 17th tinny rendition of Rudolph the Red-Nosed\n\nReindeer engulfs us in the sweet love of Christmastide, may we be permitted\n\none more dyspeptic comment about the way the universe is unfolding? \n\n  own Museum of\n\nCivilization.\n own, for it\n\nmay secretly belong to the Mayor of All Hull.\n He is so proudly possessive of it that whenever a reference is made\n\nto \'Ottawa\'s Museum of Civilization,\' he threatens to steal Mayor Jim\n\nDurrell\'s Green Creek sewage plant, perhaps Ontario\'s cultural equivalent.\n\n\n\n  Whoever is in charge of the museum has a problem.\n It has something to do with freedom of expression.\n If we recall Article 2 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, that is\n\na good thing, guaranteed regardless of race or creed to any special interest,\n\nvoting bloc and potentially violent mob.\n Except that in Quebec, if you get a whole bunch of freedom of\n\nexpression, you may run a bit short on social peace, which is an even better\n\nthing. \n\n\n Do you follow me? \n\n  Well, come back to the Museum of Civilization.\n ( It\'s that older building just behind the curving Petro-Canada gas\n\nstation.)\n This autumn it was to have a new travelling exhibition called Into\n\nthe Heart of Africa, sponsored at much public expense by the prestigious\n\nRoyal Ontario Museum.\n It was an examination of Canadian missionary and military experience\n\nin turn-of-the-century Africa, prepared under the direction of a respected\n\nUniversity of Toronto anthropologist named Jeanne Cannizzo. \n\n  Some ladies and gentlemen objected to Dr. Cannizzo\'s\n\ninterpretation of Africa of a century ago.\n Presumably their scholarly work on that era qualified them to make\n\ntelling criticisms of the display.\n That could enhance the interest of the exhibition as we unwashed\n\nviewers weighed the merits of differing views.\n No, they did not say anything relevant within our hearing, but simply\n\ndismissed it as  " racist and stereotyped."  \n\n  We don\'t know what they mean, because by noisy street\n\ndemonstrations, threats against museums, disruption of university classes,\n\nand pulling the levers of power, they blackmailed participating museums into\n\ncancelling the exhibit.\n\n\n  Canada\'s Museum of Civilization was one of those that succumbed\n\nto the mob.\n\n\n  We don\'t know whether it was a good exhibition, because we were\n\nnot allowed to see it.\n If we judge the credentials of its sponsors, and the care the Museum\n\nof Civilization must have exercised before contracting to receive it, the\n\nexhibit, however controversial, must have been worthy of our attention.\n\n\n  The kind of trouble the mobsters were prepared to incite was\n\nseen in Dr. Cannizzo\'s university classes where she was  " harassed,\n\nabused, and attacked"  by a small claque that prevented her from\n\nlecturing.\n The harassment was so violent that, on medical advice, she withdrew\n\nfrom teaching on indefinite sick leave, and her course was dropped.\n The university president apologized, but took no action against the\n\nmobsters who alone had freedom of expression. \n\n  It was bad enough that the Museum of Civilization should have\n\nbowed to such intimidation and denied us the opportunity to judge a scholarly\n\nwork.\n What is even worse is that this is, as far as we know, the first\n\ntime that a major federal institution in Quebec has given aid and comfort to "\n\nsocial peace" as a preferable alternative to freedom of expression. \n\n  We have heard no one in the Outaouais object publicly to the\n\nmuseum\'s decision.\n In the years to come, we expect to hear the museum\'s policy quoted\n\nto justify attacks against individual freedom, against individual rights, or\n\nagainst a minority culture. \n\n  Banning a cultural display because it might cause controversy\n\nwas a chilling precedent to create - especially in this place, at this time.\n\n\n  No, it was the Government of Canada that sold our rights across\n\nthe river.\n But one day, it could be the anglophone minority that has to pay.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '2a48ec69-e68f-4c80-a2ba-16d4a19c56db', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.912593+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9728168249130249, 'non_english_score': 0.027183175086975098}
{'text': 'It\'s the law in this country that small pleasure boats be equipped\n\nwith an approved personal floation device ( PFD) for every person on board.\n\n\n\n  Ironically - and tragically for nearly all of the 700 Canadians\n\nwho drowned in 1992, they are not required to be worn.\n It\'s an identical situation to that which once prevailed in this\n\nprovince with regard to automobile seat belts; but once the law required\n\ntheir use and fines began to be levied, most people buckled up. \n\n  Most boat owners have PFDs, thus complying with the law as it\n\nstands.\n But too often they lie around on seats, are buried under other gear or\n\nstowed in lockers and cupboards.\n The chance of getting into a PFD in the split second in which many\n\naccidents happen is slim indeed.\n\n\n  According to figures made public this week by the Canadian Red\n\nCross Society, at the launch of its annual water safety program, 94 per cent\n\nof those who lost their lives in incidents involving pleasure craft in Canada\n\nlast year were not wearing a PFD at the time.\n In Newfoundland and Labrador in 1992 there were 19 drownings, four\n\nwere boat-related. \n\n \n\n" will seek to prevent and / or reduce the incidence of death and suffering\n\ncaused by boating and marine-related accidents, to promote boating safety\n\nknowledge and awareness,"  according to a statement.\n This includes urging boaters not just to equip their craft with an\n\nadequate number of PFDs, as the law requires, but also to wear them as a\n\nmatter of good common sense. \n\n  It seems such a small step to ensure that the May 24 holiday and\n\nthe vacation period to follow will be both enjoyable and free from tragic\n\nmishaps on the water.  \n\n\n\n\n\n  Not only should the amount of money political parties spend\n\nduring an election campaign be a matter of public interest, there are limits\n\nthat ought to be imposed to ensure seats in the House of Assembly are not "\n\nbought" by the highest bidder. \n\n  It would be a corruption of the free democratic process if this\n\nwere to happen - as some may contend it does. \n\n  It has been seen over and over, almost since the beginning of\n\ntime, that those in power have various ways of promoting their own\n\nre-election.\n Government parties, and even opposition parties whose moment of\n\nascendency may appear to have arrived, may enjoy access to virtually\n\nunlimited funds to devote to the paraphernalia of the campaign. \n\n  The prospect of patronage, real or imagined, is a strong\n\nincentive when it comes to throwing open the personal or corporate purse in\n\norder to contribute to an election war chest. \n\n  No one knows how much was spent in the May 3 election.\n Some sources say it may have totalled about &dollar;2.7 million,\n\nfairly evenly split between parties on the one hand, and candidates on the\n\nother - &dollar;10,000 each, on average, for Liberals and Progressive\n\nConservatives, &dollar;5,000 per New Democratic Party candidate.\n As for parties, if the PCs spent &dollar;300,000 as Opposition Leader\n\nLen Simms says, and NDP Leader Jack  estimate of\n\n&dollar;100,000 for his party is correct, then what the ruling Liberal Party\n\nput out was around &dollar;1 million. \n\n  Unfortunately, nobody can know for sure so long as the party,\n\nrepresented by campaign manager Norm Whalen, refuses to divulge election\n\nexpenses.\n " It\'s not the type of thing we reveal to the press, which\n\nwill reveal it to the public and which will reveal it to our opponents,"\n\n he said, a remark that is so downright silly as to be outrageous.\n\n\n\n  Note that it comes from the same party that, as government,\n\nbrought in a new Elections Act that passed the legislature in June 1992.\n It would have required disclosure, while limiting spending to\n\n&dollar;3 a voter - but the expenditure section has not been proclaimed. \n\n  list, it is\n\npossible only to guess at the total number of eligible voters - perhaps\n\n345,000 give or take a few.\n At that rate the Liberal party itself, at &dollar;3 a head, would\n\nhave been right on the money.\n If, however, the &dollar;3 relates to combined expenditures of the\n\nparty and its candidates, they would have to be mighty pleased they did not\n\nproclaim the section before the election took place.  \n\n\n\n\n \n\nWells\'  negative reaction to the demand from people in the Bull Arm area\n\nfor more jobs on the Hibernia project. \n\n \n\n  According to Wells, the fact they reside near the project site\n\ngives residents of Come by Chance, Arnold\'s Cove, Southern Harbour, Sunnyside\n\nand adjacent communities no greater right to a job there than other\n\nNewfoundlanders.\n But by that thinking, why should any residents of this province have\n\nany greater right to employment there than other Canadians? \n\n  After all, the federal government has put up about half the\n\npre-project funding and the courts have ruled that Canada, not Newfoundland,\n\nowns the resource the project is intended to exploit  .\n\n  Suppose similar principles were applied to another important job\n\nsource, at least in normal times, the Newfoundland fishery. \n\n  The resource in the sea is a federal jurisdiction; Ottawa pays\n\nthe cost of management and protection.\n But few Newfoundlanders would admit the right to fish, or to\n\nco-manage it, belongs to other than the people who live alongside it. \n\n  It\'s good for the project to have a stable local work force, and\n\nit\'s certainly good for the area.\n If it can offer even more qualified people to fill available jobs so\n\nmuch the better. \n\n  The fact they\'re prepared to fight for those positions, so to\n\nspeak, should not be held against them.\n At the least it\'s a sign the work ethic is more alive and healthier\n\nthan Newfoundlanders sometimes are given credit for.  \n\n\n\n\n\n  In the dying days of Parliament, the Conservative government has\n\nbrought in a slim piece of legislation that purports to ban possession of\n\nfilms, videos and magazines depicting children in pornographic situations.\n\n\n\n  Strangely, the bill doesn\'t cover written material and may not\n\ncover still photos either.\n Besides, it contains exemptions that could provide loopholes for\n\nthose who deal in forbidden materials. \n\n  Nonetheless, Justice Minister Pierre Blais insists the bill\n\n " makes a strong statement about the entirely inappropriate use and\n\nportrayal of children as sexual partners." \n " who subject children to such sexual abuse\n\nand humiliation"  will be severely punished under the provisions of\n\nthe new legislation. \n\n  third attempt\n\nsince 1984 to bring in an anti-kiddie-porn law - are up to five years in\n\nprison for possession of child pornography and up to 10 years for making and\n\ndistributing such material.\n Two earlier attempts failed under criticism from a wide range of\n\ninterest groups. \n\n  It already is illegal to manufacture and distribute such material\n\nin Canada, but it is not a crime to attempt to import it.\n That\'s one reason opposition spokesmen, although saying they will do\n\nwhat they can to help the new bill win approval, exhibit little enthusiasm\n\nfor it. \n\n  They also believe that continuing exemptions for artistic,\n\nscientific, medical and educational purposes is an open invitation to abuse.\n\n\n\n  It seems they have a point.\n Canadian customs officials say 400 to 500 seizures of child\n\npornography take place at various border points annually.\n But they admit many times that number enter the country illegally.\n\n\n\n  Blais rejects criticism the bill is just a piece of pre-election\n\npoliticking that has little chance of becoming law before Parliament is\n\ndissolved and the legislation dies on the order paper.\n\n\n  But the Liberals and the NDP continue to question the bill\'s\n\nlast-minute appearance and to doubt that it can pass the Commons and the\n\nSenate in the short time available before Parliament winds up next month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  There\'s probably too much made of the suggestion that\n\nNewfoundland " wrote the book" or otherwise set the pattern for tough budgets\n\nacross the country, but the Wells administration is getting much of the\n\ncredit - or the blame - for it anyway. \n\n  The latest to follow suit are Canada\'s most populous provinces.\n Ontario with an NDP government and Quebec with a Liberal\n\nadministration brought down their budgets during the past week and dire\n\nforecasts by and large were spot on.\n There\'s a warning for smaller, weaker provinces - if the " big boys"\n\nget a sniffle, we\'d better prepare for pneumonia! \n\n  First came Ontario Finance Minister Floyd Laughren with what is\n\nbeing described as  " the biggest tax grab in the province\'s history"\n\n - &dollar;1.6 billion.\n The industrial heartland has suffering dramatically from the\n\nrecession with tens of thousands thrown out of work by hundreds of\n\nmanufacturing and business closures.\n Now its residents will pay even more - those who still work taking\n\nhome less pay, being docked an additional three points of income tax, while\n\nhigher charges are levied for driver\'s tests and parking fees. \n\n  Laughren described the tax increases as part of a restraint\n\nprogram aimed at controlling a deficit that, he said, threatens to spiral out\n\nof control and snuff out growth in the provincial economy. \n\n  On a speaking tour in the west, however, federal Finance Minister\n\nDon Mazankowski chose to differ.\n He was concerned the tax increases might have the opposite effect -\n\nconstricting what is a large slice of the national economy instead of\n\nstimulating it.\n\n\n  The condition of Quebec is not as critical to Newfoundland as\n\nthat of Ontario, which pays the bulk of taxes to the federal government,\n\nwhich in turn sends to St. John\'s close to half of the Newfoundland\n\ngovernment\'s budget.\n But how fares a province with a quarter of the country\'s population\n\ncannot but affect the rest of the country for good or for ill - and in this\n\ncase, the latter. \n\n  Finance Minister Gerard D. Levesque has put his hands almost as\n\ndeeply into the pocketbooks of Quebecers as his Ontario counterpart,\n\nextracting a whopping &dollar;1.3 billion in taxes that may not be new but\n\nbite anyway. \n\n  he announced,\n\nsaying two decades of unrestrained spending is over.\n But even with all that, most people in Ontario and Quebec probably\n\nare still better off than most people in Newfoundland and the Maritimes, and\n\nperhaps the Prairies as well, and the smaller have-not provinces can take\n\nlittle comfort if the " big boys" are having problems too.  \n\n\n National-unity plan draws fire: Editorial reaction ranges\n\nfrom lukewarm to hostile  \n\n  Lucien Bouchard, it\'s your move.\n Quebec\'s premier-in-waiting has a fundamental choice after the\n\nfederal government\'s initiative to meet the aspirations of Canadians for\n\nchanges in the way the country is governed. \n\n  Bouchard can either agree to talk about change.\n Or he can stick to his position that there\'s nothing to be talked\n\nabout until Quebec is independent. \n\n  If he chooses to ignore the federal position, he will in effect\n\nreject Ottawa\'s explicit recognition of Quebec\'s distinction in the areas of\n\nlanguage, culture and civil law - and spurn Ottawa\'s offer of a\n\nconstitutional veto for Quebec ... \n\n  While other provinces are unlikely to object to a federal\n\nresolution recognizing Quebec as a distinct society, Prime Minister\n\nChretien\'s position opens the door to new problems. \n\n  The federal proposition on veto powers seems likely to cause the\n\nmost difficulty.\n Start, though, by considering the two extremes Ottawa had to choose\n\nfrom - give everyone a veto, or give only Quebec a veto - when it came to\n\nconstitutional change.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5569dc7c-b62a-4ee1-a3f1-4d4f9b0d7b26', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.913886+00:00', 'english_score': 0.974646270275116, 'non_english_score': 0.025353729724884033}
{'text': 'Native leaders turn tables on Quebec: Rich irony in citing a \'distinct\n\nsociety\' \n\n  OTTAWA - The gods aren\'t all that crazy after all.\n From Red Sucker Lake, they have sent their prophet Elijah Harper to\n\nhumble the vainglorious pharaoh Brian Mulroney and the satrap Robert\n\nBourassa. \n\n  Oh, the delightful irony.\n In the same week that the preening, self-congratulatory Mulroney\n\nboasted to the Toronto Globe and Mail that he had deliberately set for the\n\n11th hour  " the day we\'re going to roll the dice,"  the\n\nquiet-spoken Harper brought all his proud schemes to the brink of nothing\n\n .\n\n  And Bourassa, who announced in 1971 that he was going to flood the\n\nhomelands of the James Bay Cree without giving them even the courtesy of a\n\nphone call, now finds the native people of Manitoba, Quebec and all of Canada\n\nrising to frustrate his proud designs. \n\n  You can\'t miss the quintessence of this historic juncture.\n Last week, the big boys from Ottawa, Queen\'s Park and Quebec ganged up\n\non the smallest, poorest and weakest at the first  table\n\nand they seemed to have imposed their will. \n\n  But this week, the humble people of Newfoundland and the native\n\npeople of Manitoba were talking back, and the big and powerful who triumphed\n\nlast week are confused. \n\n  Bourassa could utter his barely disguised threats to break up the\n\ncountry if " English Canada" refused to give him what he wanted.\n He could, like Mulroney, create an entire myth about poor, humiliated\n\nQuebec left out in 1981.\n But what can he answer when native people speak of being left out?\n\n\n\n  " If you look at our relationship with the country, we\n\nhave been left out for many years,"  Harper said yesterday. \n " I don\'t think a few ( more) years would matter.\n I think what needs to be done is for the aboriginal people to be\n\ntaken seriously and also to be accorded a rightful place at the\n\nconstitutional table.\n\n\n \n\n  Quebec\'s claim to be left out is Johnny-come-lately compared with\n\nthe native  .\n Quebec\'s claim to be humiliated takes on a certain unintended humor.\n\n\n\n  The natives of Manitoba sent a letter yesterday to Premier Robert\n\nBourassa, which spoke the language he best understands:  " We, the\n\noriginal people of this country, have inherited through the original\n\ntraditions of our forefathers, 55 distinct original languages.\n Fifty-two of these original languages of Canada are now on the brink\n\nof extinction."  \n\n  " Unlike you, we cannot retrieve these languages from\n\nour mother country.\n\n\n  The French language is threatened in Quebec, Bourassa claims.\n That threat cannot compare with the pressure on the native languages?\n\n\n\n  And Bourassa\'s obdurate insistence that no change be made to\n\nMeech pits him against the claims of the natives for attention now. \n\n  Phil Fontaine, who heads the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, said\n\nyesterday that they recognize Quebec as a distinct society:  " I want\n\nto say that we have never opposed Quebec\'s recognition as a distinct society.\n We recognize that and support that.\n But if Quebec is distinct, we are even more distinct.\n That\'s the recognition we want, and we\'ll settle for nothing else."\n\n \n\n  Natives from Quebec, including both Indians and Inuit, met\n\nyesterday in Quebec City and gave their entire support to what was happening\n\nin Manitoba. \n\n  " Elijah Harper is holding the fort on our behalf.\n said Conrad\n\nSioui, who represents Quebec at the Assembly of First Nations. \n\n  Gil Remillard, Quebec\'s intergovernmental affairs minister,\n\nresponded by threats.\n That seems to be the prime tool of diplomacy of the Quebec Liberal\n\nregime.\n He said that Quebec had supported self-government for native people,\n\nbut might reconsider if the passage of Meech continued to be delayed in\n\nManitoba.\n He urged the natives to put pressure on Harper if they wanted\n\nQuebec\'s support. \n\n  But of what use were threats?\n\n\n  said\n\nPhil Fontaine. \n " We want to maintain our dignity.\n We want the powers of this country to listen to us.\n\n\n \n\n  As for Bourassa\'s demand that the native people wait for another\n\nround, that won\'t wash with Phil Fontaine:  " We\'ve trusted before,\n\nand we\'ve been sold out every time.\n\n\nILLUSTRATION:  \n\n\n\n\n  Hey, Newfoundland.\n And you, Manitoba.\n What\'s the matter with you guys?\n Don\'t you want those nice Senate seats the Don - sorry, Ontario\n\nPremier David ( The Big Guy) Peterson has offered you if you ratify the Meech\n\nLake constitutional accord? \n\n  What has become the Meech Lake farce in the past couple of weeks\n\nlurches through one preposterous plot turn after another as it approaches its\n\ndenouement. \n\n  Thank God we are a relatively small, unimportant country in the\n\nglobal scheme of things.\n Because if anybody out there is paying attention to all this, we\'ll\n\nbe the laughing stock of the world. \n\n  First, there was the week-long, nightly spectacle, degrading to\n\nboth its participants and its audience, of our government leaders, most\n\nrendered visibly and increasingly goofy by long hours of confinement in\n\nliterally a smoke-filled room, let out just in time for the national\n\ntelevision newscasts to run a gantlet of cheering or heckling partisans and\n\nbabble requests for fresh clothing in response to shouted questions in\n\nMeechspeak about  " timing and certainty."  \n\n  Then there was the deal they reached, but only after the premier\n\nof Alberta physically intervened to prevent his colleagues from Newfoundland\n\nand Manitoba from walking out of the room. \n\n  The agreement that was reached was not so much an agreement as an\n\nadmission of failure to resolve the irreconcilable differences among them,\n\ndressed up as a triumph by an elaborate signing ceremony dominated by humble\n\nexpressions of gratitude from the lesser capos to " the big guy," as the\n\npremier of Saskatchewan called his colleague from Ontario, for his timely\n\ngift of a half-dozen Senate seats to the smaller provinces that cost him none\n\nof his province\'s real economic or political clout. \n\n  The officially titled Constitutional Agreement 1990 is most\n\nnotable for conditional asterisks on the signatures of the premiers of\n\nNewfoundland and Manitoba and a stapled-on legal opinion interpreting the\n\nMeech Lake intepretative " distinct society" clause that was supposed to have\n\nmaterialized out of nowhere and somehow mean everything to Newfoundland and\n\nnothing to Quebec at the same time. \n\n  The loudest guffaw of the week among the press scum confined\n\nbelow decks in a media work room at the national conference centre to watch "\n\nWally World" endlessly during the negotiations greeted Peter Mansbridge\'s\n\nperfectly deadpan explanation that the first ministers were pretending\n\nofficially that they had neither asked for the legal opinion, accepted it,\n\napproved it nor published it,  " but it exists." \n\n It is what it is, baby.\n\n\n  Maybe the opinion was supposed to have been tossed out the window\n\nof a car with the license number obscured speeding past the national\n\nconference centre in the middle of the night, to be found on the sidewalk\n\noutside the centre by a street cleaner. \n\n  Perhaps Canadians should actually be thankful that the first\n\nministers couldn\'t agree on much in their week together.\n Were it not for the quiet stubbornness and the physical stamina of\n\nthe premier of Quebec, in particular, we might have ended up with an instant\n\ntriple-E Senate and an equally instant " Canada clause" defining everybody in\n\nCanada as belonging to one  " fundamental characteristic"  of\n\nthe country or another, both without much national debate as to what they\n\nmight actually mean. \n\n  Ah, but the farce did not end with the supposed agreement to save\n\nthe accord.\n With the accord\'s ratification still very much in doubt in\n\nNewfoundland and Manitoba, the prime minister rashly boasted this week of\n\nwhat a clever strategist he was in leaving the negotiations to the last\n\nminute. \n\n  he explained\n\nto the Toronto Globe and Mail, in what may go down as famous last words.\n " You\'ve got to work backward.\n\n\n  Unfortunately, Backward Brian may have picked the wrong dates.\n And he mistakenly figured that the premier of Manitoba would know the\n\nrules for presenting a motion in his legislature.\n After all, Premier Gary Filmon has been a member for nearly 11 years\n\nnow. \n\n  Filmon\'s procedural ignorance has been drawn to national\n\nattention thanks to the ingenuity of the lone aboriginal member of the\n\nManitoba legislature, the now-famous Elijah Harper, who has been blocking\n\nratification of the accord because he says it ignores the concerns of\n\naboriginal peoples. \n\n  But it\'s suitably ironic in this affair that if Harper\'s efforts\n\nsucceed in killing the accord, then he and his fellow aboriginals wil1\n\nprobably actually lessen their chances of achieving their goal of\n\nself-government. \n\n  Quebec would boycott future constitutional negotiations, as it\n\nboycotted the last round of talks on aboriginal self-government that ended in\n\n1987.\n And that round showed that without Quebec\'s support at the table,\n\naboriginal peoples have little practical chance of overcoming the resistance\n\nof the three westernmost provinces to their self-government. \n\n  Like other Canadians, the aboriginal peoples are probably better\n\noff with the Meech Lake accord than they are without it.\n And that, surely, should be the only rational test applied to the\n\naccord at this late date, not whether it is perfect. \n\n  But then, why should we expect the aboriginal peoples to be any\n\nmore rational than the rest of us? \n\n\n\n\n  As our great national trauma nears its climax, let\'s not forget\n\nthat other political event which could turn out, in the long run, to be\n\nalmost as significant as what happens to the Meech Lake accord.\n This is the race for the Liberal Party leadership, which winds up in\n\nCalgary next Saturday. \n\n  It has been dismissed by too many as a yawner of little\n\nconsequence.\n It is far more than that - if only because the winner is an odds-on\n\nbet to become our next prime minister, the one who will have to deal with the\n\nlong-term fallout of Meech.\n\n\n  There\'s something else to be said, and it is this: at a time of\n\nnational disgust with politics and politicians - fed recently by the bizarre\n\ncircus in Ottawa - there is something heartening about the people presenting\n\nthemselves for the Liberal leadership. \n\n  We are speaking here not of the fringe runners but the three\n\ncandidates of consequence - Sheila Copps, Paul Martin and Jean Chretien.\n Cynics dismiss them as a pair of nonentities battling yesterday\'s\n\nman.\n Somehow, we are supposed to be disappointed that none has yet turned\n\nout to be the combination of sage, saint and movie star which the public is\n\nsupposedly awaiting. \n\n  Pfui.\n Let\'s live in the real world.\n There are no saviors out there - not even a reincarnated Pierre\n\nTrudeau.\n Instead, there are some decent, human, hard-working Canadians who\n\nhave put themselves through the unique hell of a leadership contest in order\n\nto serve their country.\n\n\n  Sheila Copps has been the big surprise.\n If ever someone may be said to have grown politically in a few short\n\nmonths, it is she.\n "\n\nchair-jumping lunatic,"  as she wryly admitted during a visit to The\n\nGazette. \n\n  It was a reputation honestly won by her frenetic membership of\n\nthe Liberal rat pack, but there is much more to her than that.\n She has inherited the political smarts of her father, Vic, a\n\nlong-time mayor of working-class Hamilton.\n She gave David Peterson a strong run for the Ontario Liberal\n\nleadership before moving on to Ottawa. \n\n  She speaks excellent French and Italian, and clearly won the\n\nLatin soul of Quebec with her freshness and combative spirit.\n What she still lacks is the gravitas one looks for in a prime\n\nminister; there still seems not to be an internal governor in Sheila Copps\'s\n\nmakeup.\n But she continues to grow, and time is on her side.\n\n\n  Paul Martin, too, has a deep political background.\n He inherits the strong Liberalism, not to mention liberalism, of his\n\nfather, Paul Sr.\n To this, he has added the level-headed analytical qualities of a\n\nbusinessman - indeed, a fabulously successful businessman.', 'subdomain':

{'text': 'Oh, my goodness ...\n I thought I was the chief of the Fort Norman band council in my\n\nearlier years and crazy me, I believed I grew up in Fort Norman but after\n\nyour latest edition of  News/North  , I wonder ... did I grow up in\n\nFort Franklin?\n And here I thought Fort Franklin was by a big lake by the name of\n\nSahtu or Great Bear Lake. \n\n  The picture in your latest edition says the lovely little\n\ncommunity at the junction of Great Bear River and Mackenzie River and by\n\nBear Rock, the community which faces the Mackenzie Mountains and Mackay\n\nRange, the community which the people fondly call Tulit\'a and the same\n\ncommunity where my brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, uncles, aunts and\n\nfriends live is Fort Franklin by Great Bear Mountain. \n\n  I suppose I should be getting used to this by now.\n Denendeh K\'e had the community on the other side of the river on a map\n\nthey started their show with last year.\n Whenever I used to go to the South, people wondered if Fort Norman was\n\nin the Yukon or Alaska.\n Eric Nielson in his book - The House is Not a Home - says Fort\n\nNorman\'s  " population consisted mostly of Dogrib Indians"\n\n and  " we were the only non-natives in that community for the\n\ntwo years of my father\'s tour there."  \n\n  So you see, we all make mistakes, but just a word of advice.\n If a community sits on the Mackenzie with a Peteni\'a ( rock into\n\nwater) sitting beside it, it may be Wrigley or Fort Norman.\n If the community sits by another river joining the Mackenzie it might\n\nbe Arctic Red River, Fort Simpson or Fort Norman.\n If the community sits by a Peteni\'a and a river joining the\n\nMackenzie it\'s probably Fort Norman. \n Paul Andrew\n\n\n\n If feds can spend money on Quebec, why not the N.W.T.?\n\n \n\n  I am very concerned over the financial cutbacks to the GNWT and\n\nservices.\n Not only will education suffer but many other organizations who\n\ndepend on government funding will suffer as well. \n\n  Social services, women\'s organizations and other programs\n\nand public services will need to ask for donations from corporations and\n\nthe public sector.\n We will not be able to depend on secure funding from any part of the\n\nGNWT. \n\n  The rest of Canada weeps over their own tax increases, but how\n\nwill we Northerners be able to afford to stay and live here once our tax\n\nincreases begin. \n\n  Our future is our children.\n My concern though is what will be there for our children if many ser\n\n<l> vices will have to close due to lack of funding.\n\n\n  My question is directed to the government of Canada.\n Why do you refuse us the secure funding to produce a strong and\n\nfinancially secure North.\n If you can spend on the Meech Lake Accord for Quebec, why not\n\nthe N.W.T. economic question? \n Robin Moniaw\n\n\n\n\n\n  contained a letter\n\nfrom David McCann, chairperson of the Denendeh Planning Commission, in reply\n\nto the criticisms I made about this new land use planning commission in the\n\nJan. 13  News/ North  . \n\n  Mr. McCann\'s comments about my criticisms completely miss my\n\npoint.\n I think he should read your Feb. 12 article again.\n I did not say or even imply that the commission is biased towards\n\nindustrial development and against conservation as Mr. McCann\n\nclaims. \n\n  I did imply, however, that the four territorial and federal\n\ngovernment appointees to the commission appear to be biased in\n\nfavor of industrial development since their backgrounds are in the min <l>\n\ning, oil and gas industries and since two of them hold executive positions\n\nwith chambers of commerce and with the Chamber of Mines. \n\n  Fortunately, the other four members of this commission are\n\nselected by the Dene / Metis, so the conservation viewpoint should be well\n\nrepresented by these appointees. \n\n  I am only disappointed that neither the territorial nor federal\n\ngovernments saw fit to appoint someone with a conversation or en <l>\n\nvironmental background.\n That says a great deal to me about what direction both levels of gov\n\n<l> ernment want land use planning to take in the North. \n\n  It\'s pretty obvious to me that the territorial and federal govern\n\n<l> ments have stacked their side of the deck on the side of development\n\nat the expense of environmental protection. \n\n  It may also be of interest that the Denendeh Conservation Board\n\nexpressed concerns similar to mine about this land use planning\n\ncommission at their December meeting in Aklavik. \n Alex M. Hall\n\n\n\n\n Monday Jan. 22, 1990\n\n  In the above mentioned newspaper, Richard Nerysoo stated that a\n\nnew legislative assembly building will be built as of 1993. \n\n  I feel that before this project is started, a long-awaited,\n\nlong-needed bridge should be built across the Mackenzie River near Fort Pro\n\n<l> vidence.\n This would provide access to the heavily populated areas of\n\nYellowknife and Fort Rae. \n\n  Those persons who depend on goods and supplies from\n\nYellowknife, living north and northeast, and depend on an air supp <l>\n\nly would benefit from this bridge also. \n\n  This investment in a bridge would bring a better return to the\n\npeople of the N.W.T. than would a legislative assembly building. \n\n  The cost of maintaining a ferry and building an ice road would be\n\na saving as a bridge would not require as much maintenance. \n\n  The legislative assembly building could be put on hold for\n\nseveral years more without any hardship to the residents of the N.W.T. \n Karl Mueller\n\n\n\n\n\n  The new session of the legislature started with a mild\n\nbloodletting over territorial laws appearing in French as well as\n\nEnglish.\n The debate, emotional rather than inflammatory, saw most MLAs\n\nchampion native languages and several plead for universal linguistic\n\ntolerance.\n\n\ned up looking like bigots anyway. \n\n \n\ndeclared the weekend Globe and Mail, wrapping us neatly up with a story on\n\nthe Soo, a column from Quebec and an editorial. \n\n  The national CBC, covering the story mainly because they were in\n\nYellowknife for the Liberal leadership forum anyway ( TV journalism means\n\nnews is wherever the camera happens to be), ignored one basic principle:\n\nLinguistic intolerance among those who speak French or English looks more\n\nlike linguistic injustice to those who speak neither. \n\n  Bigotry applies to English- or French-speaking Canadians who can,\n\nif they want to, navigate the law in their own mother tongue, but who don\'t\n\nthink the other founding group deserves the same privilege. \n\n  The debate last week was not an appeal to bigotry but an\n\nappeal for respect.\n said\n\nCulture Minister Titus Allooloo. \n\n\n\n It raised the question of whether, in the N.W.T., there are two\n\nfounding peoples or nine. \n\n  The working language of the territorial government is\n\nEnglish, and francophones now have laws in their own language, not just\n\nin translation. \n\n  Yet seven other languages were spoken here for a thousand years\n\nbefore French and English appeared.\n\n\n\n\n\n Cece McCauley\n\n\n  I thought we would have more coverage in the major newspapers on\n\nthe historic Liberal Party forum in Yellowknife, but it was dis <l>\n\nappointing.\n The Edmonton Journal, for one, must favor Paul Martin.\n With the small coverage, they had his picture two days in a row and\n\nno one else. \n\n  I was also disappointed in Focus North.\n It was too short for such an event.\n\n\n  It\'s cute of the Liberals to push for the aboriginal vote by\n\nsetting up an Aboriginal  Commission.\n The Liberals are busy trying to build the party and to woo the\n\naboriginals after their misdemeanor of the 1969 Indian paper ( or white\n\npaper). \n\n  Some of our native students going to universities are\n\nstudying that era; they told me about it and they were shocked!\n Maybe some of you gullible natives should read the book by Harold\n\nCardinal called The Unjust Society, and the book by E. Palmer Patterson\n\ncalled The Canadian Indian: a History Since 1500.\n\n\n  And by the way, the Liberals are not the first to recognize the\n\nimportance of the aboriginal vote!\n The P.C. party in 1986 had the first National P.C. Aboriginal\n\nCaucus in Ottawa, and they have very strong natives from across Canada\n\ninvolved. \n\n  I don\'t know who made the biggest impression at the Liberal\n\nforum.\n It was like a circus, each one trying to outdo the other.\n Chretien, they say, is a carbon copy of Trudeau and you natives must\n\nremember that Trudeau is supposed to have said there were no treaties.\n\n\n  Paul Martin seems to be next in popularity.\n I like Sheila Copps, but she is too young - like one newspaper\n\nremarked, she\'s like a teenie-bopper.\n And I don\'t know if the House of Commons is a good place to drag\n\nyour babies into.\n Couldn\'t she afford a nanny like all those big shots?\n Nunziata and Wappel come on the band wagon too late for Northerners\n\nto know who they are. \n\n  Aboriginal people can make the government stand up and take\n\nnotice if they can get their act together, such as being united across Canada\n\n- the Indians, Metis and Eskimos, and all speaking in one voice. \n\n  Make up a huge delegation of assorted aboriginal people and lobby\n\nand demand a meeting with the ministers and premiers.\n We hear of this and that group saying once in a while that they don\'t\n\nlike Meech Lake or the GST or whatever, but it\'s only little voices here and\n\nthere in the wilderness across the land. \n\n  But it\'s too late to even talk about unity among the various\n\ngroups.\n They are like government: all on a power trip.\n They have never had it so good, so you can\'t blame them either.\n\n\n  As an individual I feel that we as aboriginal people let\n\neverything slip through our fingers!\n Twenty years ago, even 10 years ago had we all worked together\n\nacross Canada in unity for our people we could have had the world in our\n\nhands.\n But we all went in splinter groups, each one looking or chasing a\n\nrainbow, power trip, jealousies, greed, egos, all got in the way of the\n\nglorious plan of salvaging what was left of the deal our people made with the\n\nCrown of England. \n\n  We played right into the government\'s hope and dream of dividing\n\nand conquering and now it\'s still going on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Valentine\'s Day, after the snowstorm of greeting cards and empty\n\nheart-shaped boxes has been swept away, is or was the day given over by the\n\nchurch to the memory of no fewer than eight Christian martyrs.\n\n\nniversary of the intended martyrdom of Salman Rushdie, author of Shame,\n\nMidnight\'s Children and of course, The Satanic Verses, sentenced to death by\n\nthe late Ayatollah Khomeni? \n\n  To celebrate Valentine\'s Day a number of Yellowknife writers,\n\ninspired by Cupid and familiar faces in the audience, stood up in the museum\n\ntheatre on the weekend and read both the prose and poems of famous authors\n\nand their own more modest compositions.\n Salman Rushdie no longer appears in public to read his creations\n\ninto the consciousness of the world.\n\n\n  Ironically again, the late Ayatollah Khomeni\'s death sentence\n\nhas raised the profile of Mr. Rushdie\'s most recent novel and has contributed\n\nin large measure to its commercial success.\n There is a growing " who\'s who" of distinguished people who have\n\nbought the book, some of whom have attempted to read it.\n It is not an easy novel.\n Described in a recent Harper\'s Magazine as a post-modernist work,\n\nthe book circles the globe, striding across cultures, symbolisms and of\n\ncourse, religious taboos.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '7242c8f8-5a81-403a-b340-125e4dff6cbf', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.916337+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9690677523612976, 'non_english_score': 0.030932247638702393}
{'text': 'Vancouver freelance writer.\n\n\n\n \n\nships, socialists and progressives in the West have had to endure the\n\nslings and arrows of outrageous critics. \n\n  One recent contributor to this page, a would-be ornithologist,\n\nprofessed to sight  " genuine red-crested Marxist-Leninists chirp <l>\n\ning"  at our universities.\n a local\n\npolitical personality who, in 1981, had expressed support both for\n\nPoland\'s Solidarity trade union and for Nicaragua\'s Sandin <l>\n\nistas.\n\n\n  In reality, the same principle applied in both cases.\n In Poland a grassroots organization representing the will of the\n\npeople was challenging a tyrannical regime imposed by a foreign power.\n In Nicaragua, a revolutionary movement supported by the large\n\nmajority of the population had overthrown a murderous dictatorship\n\nimposed upon them by a superpower, which continued to contrive to restore the\n\nrule of its henchmen. \n\n  The confused argument of this commentator exemplifies a line of\n\nthought prevalent in the West.\n Abhorring the tyrannies of so-called socialist regimes, this view\n\ncondones the U.S.-backed dictatorships of the so-called free world, no\n\nmatter how much blood sticks to their hands. \n\n  The killing of thousands of Romanians evokes outrage; the\n\nmassacre of tens of thousands of Guatemalan peasants does not.\n The police murder of a Polish priest is condemned; the large-scale\n\nkillings of Central American priests and nuns bring embarrassed silence.\n Sorrow and anger are the response to food lines and deprivation in\n\nthe Eastern bloc; the deaths by starvation and malnutrition every year\n\nof hundreds of thousands in our own hemisphere escape notice. \n\n  What permits this one-sidedness of perception, this imbalance of\n\nindignation? \n\n  Such myopia afflicts people at all points of the political\n\nspectrum.\n It has been rightly pointed out that many on the left allowed them\n\n<l> selves to be duped by the rhetoric of the Communist dictatorships, that\n\ntheir critique of capitalism led them to accept the worst sort of\n\ninhumanities committed in the name of socialism. \n\n  Of this word " " socialism" " the new\n\nCzechoslovak president Vaclav Havel has written that although it was at one\n\ntime  " for whole generations of the downtrodden and oppressed ...\n\na mesmerizing synonym for a just world,"  in Eastern Europe it\n\n " was transformed long ago into just an ordinary truncheon used by\n\ncertain cynical, parvenu bureaucrats to bludgeon their liberal-minded\n\nfellow citizens from morning until night."  \n\n  And worse.\n Leon Trotsky said in defence of the Bolshevik revolution that it had\n\ndestroyed  " an aristocratic culture [ which had] introduced into\n\nworld parlance such barbarisms as  czar  ,  pogrom  ,\n\nand  knout  ." \n True, but 70 years later we must also understand how the infamous\n\nterm  gulag  came to enter the international lexicon. \n\n  Some critics of capitalism were misled by their need for faith\n\nthat not only is a different system other than one based on greed and nar <l>\n\nrow self-interest possible, but that it had already been realized some <l>\n\nwhere.\n Evidence to the contrary was dismissed as hostile propaganda.\n\n\n\n  As a student activist in the 1960s I belonged for a while to a\n\ngroup that rejected the Soviet model of socialism as hopelessly degraded and\n\ncorrupt, but placed trust in Mao\'s China instead.\n The depredations of the Cultural Revolution which was then\n\ndestroying the lives of countless human beings were, to us, but inventions of\n\nthe bourgeois press.\n\n\n  Staunch defenders of the capitalist system evince a similar\n\nrigidity of thought.\n Their sense of security and privilege, therefore their peace of mind,\n\nare threatened by any suggestion that the system they identify with is\n\nneither just nor moral nor particularly efficient in meeting human needs.\n They are unmoved by the proximity of millions of lives blighted\n\nby economic injustice and poverty even in the North American capitalist heart\n\n<l> land. \n\n \n " The facts of life do not penetrate to the sphere in which\n\nour beliefs are cherished; they did not engender those beliefs, and they are\n\npowerless to destroy them; they can inflict on them continual blows of\n\ncontradiction and disproof without weakening them; and an avalanche\n\nof miseries and maladies succeeding one another without interruption in the\n\nbosom of a family will not make it lose faith in either the clemency of its\n\nGod or the capacity of its physician."   \n\n  People left, right, and centre develop mechanisms to dismiss\n\nunpleasant facts from their consciousness.\n We deny them, we defame those who insist on bringing them to our\n\nattention, we embrace some self-serving theory to explain them away.\n We permit political, ethnic, or religious loyalties to stifle\n\nwithin us the voices of conscience that urge us towards a true and non-biased\n\nview of events. \n\n  At Tomas Masaryk, another intellectual who became president of\n\nCzechoslovakia, once remarked:  " It hurts to think."  \n\n\n\n\n\n of the City University\n\nof New York. \n NEW YORK\n\n  AS A veteran of the 1960 campaign, I thank heaven that Bishop\n\nAustin Vaughan and John Cardinal O\'Connor were not sounding off when John F.\n\nKennedy was running for president. \n\n  First, Bishop Vaughan, the vicar of Orange County and pastor\n\nof St. Patrick\'s Church in Newburgh, N.Y., appeared to consign Gov. Mario\n\nCuomo to hell for not opposing abortion.\n\n\n  " the\n\nobligation to warn any Catholic that his soul is at risk if he should die\n\nwhile deliberately pursuing any gravely evil course of action"  -\n\nsuch as advocating the right of women to choose whether to have an abortion.\n\n\n\n  The fact that a majority of conscientious and God-fearing\n\nAmericans fails to regard the advocacy of freedom of choice as a gravely evil\n\ncourse of action does not count with these prelates. \n\n  BISHOP Vaughan and Cardinal O\'Connor are pursuing a weird\n\ncourse.\n They seem to be doing their best to verify the fears long cherished\n\nby the Know-Nothings in the 1850s, the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s and a\n\nsuccession of anti-Catholic demagogues that the Roman Catholic Church\n\nwould try to overrule the American democratic process. \n\n  They seem to be doing their best to prove the case that Catholic\n\npoliticians will not be free to act for what a majority regards as the\n\ngeneral good. \n\n  Sixty-three years ago, bigots said that because Gov. Alfred E.\n\nSmith of New York was a Roman Catholic his loyalty to the Pope in Rome would\n\nsupersede his loyalty to the Constitution and therefore he could\n\nnot be trusted in the White House. \n\n  " I recognize no power in the\n\ninstitutions of my church to interfere with the operations of the\n\nConstitution of the United States or the enforcement of the law of the land.\n I believe in absolute freedom of conscience ... in the absolute\n\nseparation of church and state ...\n I believe that no tribunal of any church has any power to make any\n\ndecree of any force in the law of the land, other than to establish the sta\n\n<l> tus of its own communicants within its own church."  \n\n  Fortunately, there were no Bishop Vaughans or Cardinal O\'Connors\n\naround to gainsay Al Smith and consign him to hell.\n Nevertheless, there were too many suspicions around for him to win\n\nthe election. \n\n \n\nnedy was a Roman Catholic he too could not be trusted in the White House.\n " I believe in an America where the\n\nseparation of church and state is absolute - where no Catholic prelate would\n\ntell the president ( should he be Catholic) how to act ... where no public\n\nofficial either requests or accepts instruction on public policy from the\n\nPope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical\n\nsource - where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or\n\nindirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials."\n\n \n\n \n\ntate to impose its will upon the general populace or to tell Catholic\n\npoliticians how to act.\n Then Al Smith and John Kennedy said, and showed, that Catholics\n\nin politics are as free as any other American citizens to base their\n\njudgments on the national interest and the democratic process. \n\n  Now Bishop Vaughan and Cardinal O\'Connor are in danger of\n\nvindicating those who have been saying that Catholics in politics must obey\n\nthe ukases of Rome. \n\n  I thank heaven that Bishop Vaughan and Cardinal O\'Connor\n\nwere not holding forth in 1960.\n If they had spoken then as they speak now, John F. Kennedy would\n\nnever have been elected president.  \n\n\n\n NEW YORK\n\n \n\ntoric step back from destruction. \n\n  After four years of refusal, Gorbachev joined the tide against\n\nthe monopoly power of the Soviet Communist party. \n\n  He decided that to keep swimming against it would soon drown him,\n\nthe party and the nation, so wretched is the rule of the party he leads and\n\nso total its failure. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ntance after Gorbachev\'s pronouncements. \n\n  To say it fast: The Soviet Union is as near collapse as a country\n\ncan be without exploding into total revolution. \n\n \n\ngrier, shabbier and colder week by week.\n\n\n  POLITICALLY, the colonial empire that czars and commissars\n\ncalled a single nation is moving rapidly toward its destiny -\n\nfragmentation. \n\n  That would be a blessing, if the national and ethnic hatreds and\n\nbigotries accumulated under colonialism allowed it to happen without pogrom\n\nand massacre. \n\n  What\'s more, the coming collapse of the entire Soviet Com\n\n<l> munist system leaves the people without any plan for a government of\n\nthe future. \n\n  Gorbachev\'s hodgepodge, halfway-house perestroika is already\n\nanother synonym for failure. \n\n  Yes, Americans can help build the bridge across chaos to tomorrow\n\nbut only in special American ways, quite other than soda and hamburgers. \n\n  Here is one way: Broaden and take part in the kind of work\n\nAmerican human rights groups have been doing for a long, difficult time.\n\n\n\n  Day after dark day, these groups kept in touch with Soviet\n\nfreedom fighters and spread the word of the struggle.\n These American groups helped the dissidents create an essential\n\nfor freedom: the international awareness of the Communist tyranny\n\nand the fact that the fight against it was going on behind the homeland\n\nwalls. \n\n  WITH the goal of Soviet freedom coming closer, it would be a\n\ntragedy if Americans now walked away from the Soviet citizens and movements\n\nthat have been fighting for years and concentrated exclusively on Soviet\n\nofficialdom. \n\n  The longtime freedom fighters need attention and help - and\n\nnot simply for moral or emotional reasons, which are important enough. \n\n  The struggle for Soviet freedom is still in its early\n\nstages. \n\n  Many American groups are helping the Soviet democracy movement.\n In doing so they help all Soviet people.\n I list the following four as thanks for their help in keeping me\n\ninformed: \n\n  Helsinki Watch, 485 Fifth Avenue, New York 10017; Freedom\n\nHouse, 48 East 21st Street, New York 10010; International League for Human\n\nRights, 432 Park Avenue South, New York 10016, and the Centre for Democracy\n\nin the U.S.S.R., 358 West 30th Street, New York 10001. \n\n \n\n  Hugely expanded contacts between American groups and the Soviet "\n\ninformals," the scores of thousands of Soviet clubs, unions and cultural\n\norganizations that sprouted in the soil of hope. \n\n  Some will blossom into local parties if democracy is allowed to\n\ngrow in the Soviet Union. \n\n  From American unions, political and religious groups, uni\n\n<l> versities and professional societies, they need fax machines,\n\ncomputers, copiers - and the fresh air of foreign contact. \n\n \n\n  The degree to which it is allowed now will have a lot to do with\n\nspeeding the inevitable end of the entire Communist system. \n\n  That, of course, is the only guarantee that the promise of choice\n\nbecomes the reality of choice, which is the single bridge across the chasm.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n  People are confused about who the aboriginal people in Denendeh\n\nare.\n We, ourselves, of all people should know who we are.\n In our own aboriginal language our people refer to us as Dene, which\n\ninterpreted into English means " " the people." " \n\n  Some of our people ( like half-breeds in the South) refer to\n\nthemselves as Metis.\n I believe this term Metis came from the French language, and means\n\n" " half-breed."

{'text': 'Action-Prevention Valcartier held its first meeting on March 18\n\nand attracted over 70 citizens, as well as the mayor of Valcartier and some\n\nof its councillors, including Ludwig Fitzpatrick, council liaison with the\n\ncrime prevention group. \n\n  Two representatives from Astronicor, an alarm company, also\n\nattended to talk about their products. \n\n  Co-ordinator Tim Brown says that since the meeting, the mail box\n\nset up to receive anonymous tips on crimes committed has already received\n\nimportant information. \n\n  The committee now has a permanent office at 1745 Valcartier\n\nBoulevard; its telephone number is 844-2097. \n\n  Brown reminds Valcartier residents that if they have a break-in or\n\nare otherwise the victims of crime, they should first phone the\n\nS&ucircumflex;reté, then notify the Action-Prevention office. \n\n  Three police officers who live in Valcartier are also working with\n\nthe committee.  \n\n\n\n By R. Clive Meredith\n\n \n\n  In company with a black Labrador retriever named Kaska, I\'m\n\npassing Jim and Pat Scott\'s demesne - but they don\'t figure in this story;\n\nthey\'re not up yet. \n\n  Modern technology has just enlivened my stroll with a delightful\n\nprogram of classical music over Radio-Canada, and now, through the earphones\n\nof my Walkman, comes the voice of Radio-Canada newsman Raymond Archambault.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Two items, almost back-to-back, catch my attention and conspire\n\nto do something nasty to my blood pressure. \n\n  Treasury Board President Daniel Johnson is expected to make a\n\nstatement to the effect that as of January 1991, salaries of all Quebec civil\n\nservants will be frozen.\n And in virtually the same breath, my friend of the early morning\n\nairwaves goes on to talk about something members of the Senate have been\n\ndebating for a while. \n\n  Something like an allowance of &dollar;153 per senator for each\n\nsitting he or she attends.\n\n\n  That\'s on top of an annual salary of &dollar;65,000 plus, and\n\nentertainment allowance of some thousands.\n just the icing.\n\n\n  While the civil servants both in Quebec City and in Ottawa will\n\nsee their salaries stagnate for a season, out of respect for the " present\n\neconomic situation". \n\n  Ain\'t it ever thus?\n Always the civil servants!\n Oh, the urge to wax cynical - but first, to repeal the libel laws!\n\n\n\n  : in one breath the\n\nmembers of the Quebec legislature voted to cut the salaries of Quebec civil\n\nservants; in the next they voted themselves a healthy increase. \n\n \n\n\n\n By Tammy Ballis\n\n\n  In the eyes of a Taoist, it is a well, a spring of fresh, clear\n\nwater, a place for the young traveller to quench his thirst.\n " need\n\nto know"  burning in the mind of life\'s apprentice.\n A few swallows and the novice becomes a warrior, prepared to pursue\n\nthe path of his choice.\n The Cegep is thus an essential presence in his life, without it he\n\nmight die of thirst. \n\n  From a Buddhist point of view, the Cegep can be seen as a temple,\n\na sacred place, a pilgrim\'s destination, for it is a centre of wisdom and an\n\narchive of information, the present incarnation of an academic community\n\nwhich has existed since human history began.\n Here the student seeks discipline, preparation, renewal, and\n\nenlightenment, in a universe devoted to teaching and learning.\n\n\n  Put the question to a 17 year-old girl with a feminist heart, and\n\nshe might answer that the Cegep is a kind of cocoon, allowing the adolescent\n\nto metamorphose into a wise, mature, and independent woman.\n Here the present team passes the baton to the future team in the\n\nhuman relay race. \n\n  Or take the father of a 16 year old son: how would he define a\n\nCegep? \n\n  If he has earned his living by physical labor, he knows all too\n\nwell the meaning of the word " " tired" " ; he\'ll tell you\n\nthe Cegep is a means for his son to reach a life less harsh than his own.\n Here, one can learn to carve a life with brain rather than brawn, a\n\nlesson which must be learned in a technological age. \n\n  If he is a middle-class professional, his own experience\n\ntells the father that the Cegep is a port of departure.\n He knows the Cegep years are the gestation period preceding\n\nadulthood, a time to make choices and acquire an education which is not only\n\nacademic, but also spiritual and emotional. \n\n  To the socialist, Cegep is a hub of ideas and ideologies, of\n\npolitical and social activities.\n It is a feast to satisfy a hunger for knowledge and understanding of\n\npolitical processes, complete with a mini-society open to listen and\n\ncontemplate change. \n\n \n\nened with losing his job if he can\'t learn to use a computer, the Cegep\n\noffers courses which can bring him up to date in his field. \n\n  To the woman who left the work force for family reasons, the\n\nCegep represents the opportunity to reintegrate into the world of work.\n\n\n  Even a tourist seeking the name of a local wildflower can use the\n\nCegep\'s library as a source of information. \n\n  This is all very nice, but what about your average,\n\nrun-of-the-mill, materialistic guy, who just wants to make enough money to\n\nlead a quiet little life in the suburbs with his wife, his one-and-a-half\n\nchildren, and his subcompact?\n ?\n\n\n\n  Realistically, he knows the high paying jobs are held by people\n\nwith diplomas.\n He\'ll be aware that prices are rising, and that even his lifestyle is\n\nbecoming a pretty expensive undertaking.\n If he\'s reasonably well-informed, he\'ll know high tech employers are\n\ncrying for trained and competent employees.\n So he\'ll say, " The Cegep is the way to go!\n It\'s free, in three years I can learn a marketable trade, such as com\n\n<l> puter programming and repair, and then I\'ll have it made." \n\n  To sum up, it is obvious that the Cegep can be perceived from\n\nmany points of view.\n I see it as a tunnel transforming the children who enter it into\n\nyoung men and women, who emerge still young enough to be idealistic, but also\n\nmature enough to have learned patience, perseverance, and commitment to a\n\ncause.\n Whether you use your Cegep as a place to play volleyball or watch a\n\ngood movie cheaply, or entrust it with fostering understanding and discipline\n\nin young people, it\'s definitely an essential presence in modern society.\n\n\n\n  Tammy Bailis, a teacher of mathematics and computer science\n\nin the English section of the Sept-lles Cegep, won a &dollar;500 award in a\n\nrecent province-wide contest with this essay, originally written in French.\n\n  \n\n\n\n By Karen Macdonald\n\n  " Let\'s get the divorce over with first and then we\'ll\n\ndivide up the bounty"  is what many Quebec nationalists have been\n\nsaying during this latest round of constitutional wrangling.\n That\'s what Lise Payette had to say to Peter Gzowski last week during\n\nthe conference of the Canadian Association of Journalists. \n\n  It is true that occasionally we hear about divorced couples\n\nremarrying the same partner, but it is unlikely that the rest of Canada would\n\nbe willing to take Quebec back once separation is a  fait accompli  .\n\n\n\n  No wonder federalists and even some nationalists argue that\n\nQuebec should take its time making any decision about its future.\n The political debate going on in Quebec and Canada today will change\n\nthe course of history.\n Any decisions made by Quebec unilaterally or by Quebec in\n\nnegotiations with Ottawa and / or the other provinces should be made only\n\nwith careful consideration for all sides of the issue. \n\n  After all, before six million people decide to get a divorce,\n\nthey should sleep on it, for at least a couple of nights.  \n\n\n\n By Rev. Bill Jay\n Chalmers-Wesley United Church ( Quebec) and St. Andrew\'s United\n\nChurch ( Valcartier Village)\n\n  A few years ago, while living in Montreal, I followed with great\n\ninterest a series of on-spot news reports carrying a story out of Jerusalem.\n The story, covered locally by radio station CJAD, gripped the\n\ninterest of listeners as it unfolded. \n\n  It began on a Sunday with the report of a large demonstration in\n\nsupport of a strange religious figure, which alarmed the religious leaders of\n\nIsrael, calling on the government to have him put to death for allegedly\n\ncalling himself the Son of God. \n\n  In a lynch-mob atmosphere, the following hours saw this figure\n\nput through hasty trials and sentencing to the death penalty.\n The cruel public execution was reported in all its gruesome detail,\n\neven including a kind of poker game that the executioners apparently played\n\nat the victim\'s feet! \n\n  And, in a classic example of covering up a shameful deed, the\n\ndead body was whisked away from the cross where the death penalty had been\n\ncarried out.\n Scarcely had the body grown cold in its temporary grave, when a\n\nbulletin reported it had vanished. \n\n  At the same time, this unfortunate man, recently killed, was\n\nreported to have been seen alive by a number of his close friends. \n\n  Well, I\'m sure you have guessed by now whom I am speaking of -\n\nJesus, whose living presence we celebrate this coming Sunday, Easter.\n Obviously, if these events described in a modern journalistic fashion\n\nhad not occurred, we would probably not be observing Easter in our time. \n\n  But hold on, why would a story more than a few days old, let\n\nalone 2,000 years old, be of that much interest that millions of people would\n\ngather in churches to hear it all over again?\n After all, isn\'t it stale news?\n Haven\'t we heard it for the umpteenth time, ever since our earliest\n\nchildhood? \n\n  What is it about this story that holds our attention?\n By itself it\'s just another senseless, cruel assassination or\n\nkilling, not unlike those we have heard of in such countries as El Salvador\n\nand Chile. \n\n  I submit that by itself the death would have been forgotten in\n\ndays, if not hours, if it had not been for precisely what had angered the\n\nreligious authorities of  time causing them to have him put to\n\ndeath. \n\n  Paul the apostle, a noted leader of the early Christian Church,\n\nprovides a convincing argument for believing in this Jesus as indeed being\n\nOne sent by God.\n ( You can read it in detail for yourself in the Bible in Acts 109:\n\n37-43)\n That short, but powerful stating of the case for believing in Jesus\n\nis what both angered the evil, corrupt religious leaders of the day and has\n\ngiven new hope and encouragement for millions of people since. \n\n  In short, the case for Easter is the healing, forgiving, empow\n\n<l> ering experiences that are today possible for you because of what\n\nhappened 2,000 years ago. \n\n  I invite you to attend church this coming Sunday to hear once\n\nagain this magnificent story of hope.  \n\n\n The Law and You: Details involved in settling an estate\n\n \n\n  When a person passes away, the family\'s immediate concern is to\n\nmake the necessary funeral arrangements in an expedient manner according to\n\nthe wishes of the deceased expressed in his or her Last Will and Testament or\n\naccording to the family\'s good judgment if there is no will. \n\n  However, once those formalities are seen through, one must\n\nalso settle the estate of the deceased.\n Depending on the assets and liabilities in the estate, it may be very\n\nstraightforward or very complex.\n Either way, one must make sure that it is done properly and\n\nefficiently so that there will be no unforseen problems afterwards. \n\n  The family usually goes through a mourning period and is not\n\nready or willing to handle the technical aspects of a loved one\'s estate\n\nsettlement.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a6be415b-8967-41cf-8005-8accf27d4129', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.918963+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9738143086433411, 'non_english_score': 0.026185691356658936}
{'text': 'And then there are the people who make you sing for\n\nsupper   \n\n  Boy!\n Did I have a treat!\n It was all kindness of our Chinese alumni in Toronto who invited me to\n\ndinner.\n It wasn\'t just any dinner, mind you.\n It was the 1994 version of the annual Concordia Toronto Chinese Alumni\n\nAssociation\'s New Year\'s banquet, this year celebrating the Year of the\n\nDog.\n I was just the teensiest bit nervous about the whole thing, mainly\n\nbecause, right there, in black-and-white on the invitation, was the terrify\n\n<l> ing word " " karaoke." " \n\n  But that word appeared after the promise of a 10-course Chinese\n\nmeal at a fine restaurant in deepest Scarborough.\n Gluttony overcame potential embarassment and I accepted the\n\nassignment. \n\n  I was picked up by Toronto chapter President Marty Ginsherman (\n\nBA 76) and then had the pleasure of meeting his charming wife Debbie Lean (\n\nMA 85, PhD 87).\n She\'s one of the people known for actually standing up and\n\nsinging when the karaoke heats up - and for doing it well. \n\n  We joined about 60 Toronto-area alumni, mostly Chinese, in a\n\nsmall banquet hall glamourously outfitted for the event.\n I met Daniel Chan ( BComm 78, BA 85) who is president of the Toronto\n\nChinese alumni.\n His organizational skills were evident everywhere, as was his\n\nsmall and delightful daughter.\n Chan told me the group has a list of 140 members.\n For the first time, he said, Concordia grads at the New Year\'s\n\nbanquet outnumbered Loyola and Sir George alumni. \n\n  The meal was all exotic dishes like shark\'s fin soup with\n\nisinglass and dried scallops, broiled crab-clams, and Chinese longevity\n\nnoodles.\n\n\n  Florence Yaffe ( S BA 61) and Norman Poon ( BComm 85) were\n\nemcees for the evening and, with the able assistance of Florence Lee ( BComm\n\n82) kept things rolling with plenty of prize drawings and, of course, the\n\nkaraoke. \n\n  Toronto chapter Past President John Monroe ( BCompSci 79) did a\n\nturn with Lean, a sterling performance of the   On\n\nTop of the World  . \n\n  Any number of people got up to perform solos, duets or group num\n\n<l> bers.\n\n\n  A raffle of an original painting by Bernice Kwong ( S BSc 57) and\n\ntwo tickets to  Miss Saigon  closed the evening.\n\n\nple - one I\'d be happy to repeat. \n\n  Oh, I suppose you want to know if I got brave and sang.\n Only the Toronto alumni know for sure.\n\n\n\n  I\'d like to take this opportunity to mention a couple of people\n\nwho\'ve been pitching in and making my life a lot easier.\n Mark Cohen and Sara Iwaasa are two students in the graduate\n\ndiploma program in journalism.\n For this and the previous issue, they have been contributing time and\n\nwriting as student interns. \n\n  Cohen is responsible for most of the news stories in this issue -\n\nyou\'ll recognize his works from the - MC at their ends - and for the story on\n\nthe Toronto phonathon.\n Sara was co-author with me of the story on initiatives by and\n\nfor First Nations students. \n\n  I commend them for their hard work, excellent writing and\n\nreporting skills, and for being there when I needed them.  \n\n\n\n\n School of second chance should be proud of the\n\nmoniker   \n\n  My elementary school had a very special class called the\n\nOpportunity Class.\n When we finished Grade 6, most of us were sent on plodding through\n\nthe regular classes all the way to graduation, marriage, children,\n\na mortgage and the wretchedness of being an adult.\n But certain ones were plucked from us and sent off to the Opportunity\n\nClass.\n It was sold to them as something quite wonderful; but the name didn\'t\n\nfool us and it didn\'t fool them.\n The teachers could call it whatever they liked.\n All of us kids knew that entering that class had nothing to do with\n\nopportunity.\n\n\n  I\'ve no doubt the class was well meant and, certainly, the\n\nteachers were dedicated.\n Yet, there was surely something terribly wrong in branding an\n\n11-year-old child for life as someone who could not cope with any education\n\nbeyond the most elementary level.\n The door that stayed open for the rest of us slammed loudly and\n\nslammed forever in their faces.\n Though we couldn\'t know it at the time, that was when our schooling\n\nceased to be education and became just a screening process. \n\n  Oh sure, there are some children who have learning problems so\n\nserious that we can\'t do much for them within a regular program.\n But I knew those kids we dropped off like unwanted baggage at the\n\nOpportunity Class.\n I played with them.\n There was nothing more seriously wrong with most of them than lack of\n\nthe sort of home surrounding that would have made them good students.\n\n\n  I guess that doesn\'t matter any more.\n They were sifted through the screen and they fell through to the\n\nground and there they lay while we were shovelled onto the next layer of\n\nscreen. \n\n  I noticed recently that the news services carried a story about\n\nJapanese schools which seem to be doing rather better than ours.\n The story had the usual reasons - family expectations and school\n\ndiscipline figured prominently - but they also gave another reason worth\n\nconsidering.\n Japanese schools start with the assumption that all children\n\nhave the ability to learn.\n Think of it.\n All children have the ability to learn.\n That\'s something we should remember when we\'re sifting through our\n\nstudents. \n\n  Sir George Williams was founded on something close to the\n\nprinciple that everyone can learn.\n It was popularly known in the early days as the school of the second\n\nchance, the one that would take in students who had failed at other\n\nuniversities or, like me, didn\'t have the grades to get into one of them in\n\nthe first place. \n\n  Sir George was successful, too.\n Picking through the ashes of all those rejects, it produced a\n\nremarkable number of doctors, lawyers, teachers and business people - and\n\nthat from students other universities had said just weren\'t up to university\n\nwork. \n\n  When the merger came, Loyola brought its own and very similar\n\ntradition of education to form Concordia.\n Together, Sir George and Loyola formed a solid base for education,\n\nrather than screening.\n The question now is, can their common tradition survive?\n\n\n  Most of that pressure comes from reputation or, rather, the\n\nsearch for one.\n A university needs a solid reputation if it is to be taken\n\nseriously by governments and donors and the general public, and if it is to\n\nattract students.\n The trouble is that few of those people have much understanding of\n\nwhat a university does - and rather less of what it should be doing.\n Given that lack of understanding, it\'s all too easy to base the\n\nreputation on big names associated with the university - in no matter\n\nhow remote a past - on star pupils, or simply on the relative social\n\nstanding of the mummies and daddies of the students. \n\n  That puts universities under pressure to forget about education\n\nand just concentrate on screening out the weaker students to create the\n\nillusion of high standards.\n\n\nMaclean\'s  survey, further discourages any attempt to place the\n\nneeds of people over those of reputation.\n Based, as they must be, on the assumption that all universities\n\nshould be alike, rankings actually discourage the sorts of educational\n\nchallenges that universities should be taking up. \n\n  In short, universities are forced into a race against each other\n\nto build reputations appealing to ignorance and snobbery. \n\n  When I was a student at Sir George, I was a snob ( at least some\n\nof my teachers would have added " ignorant").\n I was embarrassed at attending the university of the second chance.\n When relatives asked where I was going, I would mumble.\n I would have killed to be at a more prestigious school, one whose\n\nname alone would buy me respect. \n\n  It took me years to learn better.\n Too bad, as they say, we get too soon old and too late smart.\n I now realize that, of my degrees, I\'m proudest of my BA from Sir\n\nGeorge.\n I\'m proud of having taught at a Loyola that cared about its students.\n I\'m proud to be teaching at Concordia because it still uses the word\n\n" " opportunity" " to mean opening doors rather than closing\n\nthem.\n And I\'ll stay proud just as long as Concordia holds out against the\n\npressure to look like all the others.  \n\n\n\n Pageantry, pomp and ceremony mark this special rite\n\nof passage   \n\n  This was the third Concordia convocation I had attended.\n To the first, I went as an observer and sat amongst proud families\n\nand friends of the graduates.\n To the second, I went as a graduate and sat at the front of the\n\ntheatre, awaiting my turn to cross the stage and receive my degree.\n This time I went as a member of the Concordia staff, sat on stage and\n\nsaw our new chancellor take office. \n\n  We lined up deep in the bowels of Place des Arts.\n We were arrayed in academic dress running the gamut from basic black\n\nrobe with hood to glamorous creations in brilliant hues of satin and\n\nvelvet, fur-trimmed with matching crush caps - ensembles to make Henry VIII\n\nenvious. \n\n  Once adjusted and tweaked into place, academic dress looks well\n\non just about anyone provided they maintain a statuesque immobility.\n We did not, so a deal of twisting, turning and general rustling went\n\non as gowns were resettled, and as hoods were adjusted, re-adjusted and then\n\nfound to have been put on inside out.\n Still, by the time we processed grandly onto the Salle\n\nWilfrid-Pelletier stage, we were an impressive group. \n\n  Before us had gone the graduates, after us came members of the\n\nBoard of Governors, visiting dignitaries, honorary degree recipients\n\nand, finally, the new chancellor. \n\n  Later, in addressing convocation, Chancellor Eric Molson\n\nwould say that his long-time wish to be back in school had been not only\n\nfulfilled but exceeded - he found himself  " installed." \n It does sound as though he should have been rolled in on a dolly and\n\nplugged in somewhere.\n He was, in fact, trumpeted in with much pomp and circumstance.\n He was sworn in, received his robes and cap, and was greeted by\n\ndignitaries from other universities across the country.\n Sumptuously garbed chancellors, rectors and other representatives of\n\ntheir institutions stepped forward to congratulate and welcome Molson.\n\n\n\n  Then came the graduates.\n One after another they climbed the stairs, gave their names and\n\nstepped out onto the stage.\n I remembered my own convocation of a few months ago, and the mingled\n\nstage-fright and pride which propelled me across that seemingly endless\n\ndistance. \n\n  It\'s just about impossible to applaud for every graduate - no\n\nmatter how willing the spirit, the flesh of arms and hands is simply not up\n\nto the task.\n It didn\'t really matter.\n Most grads seemed to have personal cheering sections out there\n\nsomewhere.\n Whoops and hollers greeted some; one was given a continuous hand of\n\napplause - by one pair of hands - throughout his transit of the\n\nstage.\n In the platform party, the professors of each discipline could be\n\nidentified as they heartily acknowledged their students.\n Every so often, someone who had been carefully seated at the end of\n\nthe onstage rows would step forward to present a degree - to a son or a\n\ndaughter - and I\'d watch a hug and hear a soft  " thanks, Mom."\n\n \n\n  However light the applause for the undergraduates, it filled the\n\nhall for the PhDs.\n Each successful candidate was welcomed with an ovation.\n Then, in a gesture I hope is a part of convocations everywhere, the\n\nnew PhDs were ushered, not back to their seats, but to seats on the stage\n\nsignalling recognition of their achievement and of their new membership\n\nin the august company of doctors of philosophy.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '0f2a224c-8cb2-40b0-a7c1-0a1dd4635f99', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.920520+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9840259552001953, 'non_english_score': 0.015974044799804688}
{'text': 'By any measurement, it would be difficult to call the two-day\n\nmeeting of agriculture ministers in Winnipeg this past week a success.\n Nowhere was the lack of success more evident than in the painful\n\nattempts by the ministers, led by the federal government\'s Don Mazan <l>\n\nkowski, to find something positive to say when they met the public at the end\n\nof the gathering. \n\n  The ministers claim to have reached an agreement in principle that\n\nsome sort of agricultural safety net is required in Canada, the more so if\n\nthe current negotiations by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs\n\nand Trade in Geneva collapse, as they are threatening to do.\n The trouble with the Winnipeg meeting is that this is about the only\n\nthing the ministers could agree upon. \n\n  No decisions were reached about the size or scope of the safety\n\nnet, none about who would participate in it.\n Most importantly there was no decision at all about the sharing of the\n\ncosts.\n Considering that conservative estimates of the cost of a safety net\n\nare running around &dollar;1.5 billion a year, it is most important to\n\nsettle, up front, where the money is coming from. \n\n  Mr. Mazankowski has fallen back on the crutch used so often by\n\nOttawa, saying that most of the money the federal government decides to\n\ncontribute will come from existing programs.\n Farmers can be forgiven if they wonder what will be done to maintain\n\nprograms which are already considered essential if the funding is to be\n\ndiverted to new priorities.\n Provincial governments will wonder where they are supposed to come up\n\nwith their one-third of the cost. \n\n  It would make a lot of sense to roll into one program the hodge\n\npodge of crop insurance schemes, one-time support and marketing programs and\n\npossibly to include transportation subsidies in the mix.\n Before this can be done, however, some basic decisions will have to\n\nbe taken and some basic admissions made by different levels of government.\n\n\n\n  There should be no doubt, for example, that the cost of\n\nmaintaining Canada\'s grain-growing industry in a world of subsidy wars is a\n\nfederal responsibility.\n The cause of the trouble, the major subsidy war between the European\n\nCommunity and the United States, is international in scope, and it is\n\nunrealistic to ask individual farmers, or provincial governments, to put up\n\nthe money needed for the industry to survive. \n\n  One of the first things needed is an agreement on the amount of\n\nthis survival portion of the safety net.\n Then there should be a declaration by Ottawa that this part will be\n\nfinanced federally, and not from existing programs.\n The trade war is an artificial barrier which must be dealt with in\n\nthe national interest. \n\n  The balance of the safety net should be negotiated and the cost\n\nshared.\n Farmers already contribute to crop insurance, and should continue to\n\ncontribute to whatever part of the safety net will cover the risks now\n\ncovered by insurance.\n\n\n  The ministers meet again in February.\n The problems will still be there, and will have become a bit more\n\npressing as the beginning of another crop year approaches.\n By February, the ministers should be able to get past the agreement\n\nin principle stage.  \n\n\n\n\n  Mr. Justice Charles Huband\'s judgment on pornography is\n\nwidely popular for obvious reasons.\n It succeeded instantly in getting pornography merchants out of\n\nneighborhoods that didn\'t want them.\n It provided a way out for those who were troubled by the tension\n\nbetween their commitment to free speech and their hatred of the sexual\n\ndebasement which accompanies pornography.\n It seemed to provide the common sense judgment that a lot of people\n\nhad been looking for. \n\n  " intellectual, not sensual\n\narousal is what the Charter is designed to protect"  and that  "\n\nwhat we see are expressions of loins and glands, rather than hearts and\n\nminds"  are likely to make their way into the next volume of \n\nColombo\'s Canadian quotations  ." \n\n  Despite their superficial appeal, however, they reflect a\n\nmisunderstanding of both art and human psychology and pose a renewed threat\n\nto freedom of expression. \n\n  It is simply not as easy as Judge Huband would have us believe to\n\ndifferentiate between hearts and minds on the one hand and loins and glands\n\non the other.\n Human actions, human thinking and human emotions tend to be\n\ninfluenced by both.\n Human beings are not neatly compartmentalized.\n Laws which seek to validate the intellectual and outlaw the\n\nsensual distort human reality.\n In the process, they do not even necessarily bring about the\n\nimprovement in human behavior that supporters of censorship hope for.\n Throughout history, the brain has done as much to drive people to\n\ncruel and vicious actions as have the loins and glands. \n\n  Those considerations are not terribly important when applied to\n\nthe sort of trash that Judge Huband was dealing with but the problem with\n\ncensorship always comes at the margins and his judgment provides little\n\nhelp in that area. \n\n  be judged an\n\nappeal to loins and glands and banned once again from the bookstands?\n Will learned professors of English literature be required to perjure\n\nthemselves in court once again by testifying that  Fanny Hill  is a\n\nwork of intellectual stimulation.\n How much help will the new judgment be in dealing with such difficult\n\nissues as Robert Mapplethorpe\'s photography or other sexually explicit works\n\nof visual art? \n\n  Judge Huband is the latest in a long line of Canadian judges who\n\nhave tried to sort out the relationship between pornography, censorship\n\nand freedom of expression.\n\n\n\n\n\n Special to the Free Press\n\n  Prime Minister Brian Mulroney ( with one " " o"\n\n" ) , in his unending search for popularity, approval and possibly\n\neven votes, this week followed up his apology to Canadians of Italian\n\nbackground interned during the Second World War with an apology to\n\nCanadians of Ukrainian background, all now deceased, who were interned\n\nas  " enemy aliens"  during the Great War of 1914-1918.\n\n\nfrom the public purse. \n\n\n  Now that the PM has discovered that confession is good for the\n\nsoul, etc., there is speculation that he will soon announce the creation of\n\nan official " Apology Commission" fashioned along the lines of the\n\nSpicer-Commission that is now preparing to wander across the nation gathering\n\nthe views of ordinary Canadians on the future of this great and curiously\n\ntroubled nation. \n\n  Since the prime minister has set a precedent by offering an\n\napology to people no longer in the land of the living, experts feel that the\n\ngovernment could be called upon to reopen for study and apology cases of\n\ninjustice once thought to have receded into the dim regions of history.\n The Apology Commission, it is felt, will have its work cut out for\n\nit. \n\n  It will not be long, some say, before Prime Minister Mulroney\n\nwill be offering the regrets of the Canadian people - not to mention a\n\nlarge compensation cheque - to the descendants of those Acadians who\n\nwere expelled from what is now Canadian territory in 1755. \n\n  Canadians have felt terrible about it ever since - especially\n\nfollowing the publication of that celebrated poem by Longfellow - and it is\n\nfelt that they will welcome the opportunity to make amends. \n\n  A figure of &dollar;30 million has been bandied about as a\n\npossible compensation fee to anyone who feels that they are the\n\ncustodians of the suffering endured by Evangeline and her friends and\n\nrelations.\n " it is never too\n\nlate to patch things up."  \n\n  There is also talk of offering compensation and a full\n\napology to Canadians of American background over the frosty welcome\n\naccorded them at Quebec on New Year\'s Eve, 1775.\n A visiting American army was turned back in a snow storm and its\n\ngeneral shot to death by unfriendly Canadians.\n It is understood that the PM and External Affairs Minister Joe Clark\n\nhave already apologized to President Bush and offered compensation in\n\nthe form of yet another verbal attack on the president of Iraq. \n\n  The two founding peoples will not be left out of the apologies.\n The government\'s Apology Commission, it has been stated, will ask\n\nfrancophones to grovel to anglophones over the death of anglophone\n\nGeneral Wolfe at the battle on the Plains of Abraham in 1759.\n At the same time, anglophones will be asked to grovel to francophones\n\nover the death of francophone General Montcalm in the same battle.\n A separate Royal Commission may have to be set up to arrange\n\ncompensation. \n\n\n  Canadians of American background may be asked to say they\n\nare sorry for the sacking and burning of Toronto by American forces in\n\n1813, although the American-Canadians have indicated that they will\n\ndecline to do so unless the Canadian government offers an unconditional\n\napology for the sacking of Washington and the burning of the White House\n\nin 1814. \n\n  It is understood that words of regret and possibly heavy compen\n\n<l> sation will be offered to descendants of the Selkirk Settlers for the\n\nharassment they suffered during their first years in the Red River\n\nColony and there are indications that Canadians claiming descent from United\n\nEmpire Loyalists will get an apology and compensation because the farms\n\ntheir ancestors were granted upon their arrival in Canada were covered with\n\ntrees and rocks.\n Ukrainians and others who settled on the prairies, it has been\n\npointed out, were given farms that had been clear of heavy timber since the\n\nIce Age. \n\n\n  "\n\nwe are looking for a level playing field for everybody, even the dead."\n\n\n ( This writer, by the way, intends to apply for heavy compensation\n\nfrom the Canadian government.\n His great-great-great grandfather was palmed off with a lousy farm on\n\nthe Bay of Quinte in 1785 and several of his relations were tarred and feath\n\n<l> ered by Americans on their way north.\n He will settle for a mere &dollar;1.5 million and a seat in the\n\nSenate). \n\n  It is estimated that the Apology Commission will be working until\n\nwell into the 21st century in its attempt to set matters to rights and make\n\nall Canadians happy and rich.\n After all, everybody has something to complain about.\n Some have several things to complain about.\n Few, it is thought, will be shy about speaking up.\n The motto on Canada\'s coat-of-arms will be changed, of course.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Manitoba Hydro is being criticized for setting its conservation\n\ntargets too low and for locking itself into an agreement with Ontario Hydro\n\nwhich, if things go wrong, could cost Manitobans money.\n The criticism has some foundation, but must be considered in the\n\nlight of the utility\'s plan for future development. \n\n  Hydro\'s conservation target - the saving of 100 megawatts of\n\npower by the year 2000 - represents about ten per cent of the utility\'s\n\nexpected growth in the period, or the growth expected for one full year.\n Other utilities have set higher conservation targets but with no\n\nguarantee that they will achieve them. \n\n  Conservation, as a means of saving electricity, is a lot easier\n\nto target than to achieve.\n Much of the conservation target set by Hydro will be achieved\n\nnot by persuading customers to turn off lights, but by investing money which\n\nwill make it profitable for customers to save electricity.\n "\n\ncustomer\'s side"  of the electric meter will not be popular with\n\nthose customers whose money is being invested, but it is the only proven way,\n\napart from rationing, to persuade customers to reduce their consumption. \n\n  Given the massive hydro base of the Manitoba utility,\n\nconservation is not as attractive a means of saving power as it is for a\n\nutility which generates most of its power from fossil fuels it must pay for.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '0e25f703-2b6b-4441-b173-4fcf930a01e8',

{'text': 'Winnipeg Free\n\nPress  on October 28 comparing the problem of the GST to the problem of\n\nour deficit. \n\n  Professor Bellan based his entire letter on two assumptions that\n\nsound good in theory, but are not realistic alternatives.\n He stated that we did not have to worry about the size of our deficit\n\n( and I assume he implies the size of our debt) because a government can\n\nalways raise money to pay it back.\n First of all, they can raise taxes and, secondly, they have the right\n\nto simply print money to pay debt. \n\n  Professor Bellan fails to consider what happens if the government\n\nchooses either of those courses of action.\n If the government raises taxes, who do you think will pay them?\n Most of us who have witnessed the workings of government for any\n\nlength of time will realize that they will be dipping into our pocketbook.\n How much more can they raise income taxes before people will\n\nsimply revolt? \n\n  If they attempt to tax something other than income, for example\n\nconsumption, then look at the hue and cry in the country because of the\n\nGST.\n Professor Bellan fails to mention that taxes must be paid by\n\nsomebody, and that somebody will be us.\n The imposition of the amount of tax that will be required will\n\nsubstantially affect our lifestyle. \n\n  Mr. Bellan also suggests that a government can simply print more\n\nmoney when it needs to pay debt.\n What he neglects to mention is that if a government does just that,\n\nthey run the very real risk of serious inflation. \n\n  If you double the amount of money in the country, then you have\n\nmore money chasing fewer goods, and this causes prices to spiral upwards.\n In some countries they have spiralled totally out of control.\n How would you feel about the state of our economy if the price of\n\nmilk doubled every month? \n\n  Professor Bellan does a disservice to ordinary Canadians by\n\nspouting such economic nonsense.\n It is no doubt true that a government is very different from the rest\n\nof us because it can impose any sort of tax it wishes, and it can print as\n\nmuch money as it needs to pay its bills.\n If a government chooses either of those courses of action and acts\n\nirresponsibly, it could bring Canada\'s economy to its knees. \n\n  Professor Bellan has said that we don\'t have a problem because\n\nthe government can take some action.\n He has failed to consider the disastrous consequences of that\n\naction, and his letter is deliberately misleading. \n\n  It was rather ironic that the same paper also contained an\n\narticle entitled  Getting out of the Debt Trap  and the basic\n\npoint of that article was that Canadians have too much individual debt and\n\ncannot get out of it.\n Professor Bellan attempted to make the point that a government was\n\nvery different from a business, and I would assume he would draw the same\n\ndistinction between the government and an individual.\n I do not agree.\n Our government has the same problem as the individuals referred to in\n\nthe latter article. \n\n  We as a country have been living beyond our means for years.\n I have heard statistics that we have the highest debt per person in\n\nthe entire world.\n\n\nsponsible debts.\n Sooner or later we will have to pay the price of that debt, and when\n\nwe do, it will not be pleasant.\n Economists such as Professor Bellan must be looking for the\n\ndownfall of our present system if they advocate such economic nonsense.\n\n\n MICHAEL WALDRON\n\n\n\n\n\n  Agency\n\nfailed family in fatal tragedy, judge says   .\n\n  In his deliberations Judge Winston Norton concluded that the\n\nkillings of Mary Ann, Bradley and Jimmy Reid by their father Raymond and his\n\nown subsequent suicide, occurred as a result of Child and Family Ser <l>\n\nvices  " not being equipped to handle the problems with which it is\n\nfaced." \n By implication the judge attributes this tragedy to the incompetence\n\nof social services agencies and in so doing he advances the provincial\n\ngovernment\'s harmful indifference towards the hundreds of children whose\n\nlives are in jeopardy as a result of family violence. \n\n  In response to the Reid killings, Family Services Minister Harold\n\nGilleshammer defended his department by stating that budgets have\n\nincreased substantially over recent years.\n This transparent rhetoric does not, of course, speak to the critical\n\nissue of whether adequate funds were allocated in the first place.\n\n\n  The basic foster rate has been increased but this is a direct\n\nbill-through which does not affect the funding to the Child and Family\n\nServices agencies.\n In fact, their budgets have been dramatically lessened\n\nresulting in the cutback of vital and often life-preserving services to\n\nchildren.\n The magnitude of the problem of child abuse in Manitoba is\n\nindeed overwhelming and preventive services are virtually non-existent. \n\n  One of the few agencies providing such services is the Community\n\nResource Clinic, 321 McDermot Avenue, which opened in the aftermath\n\nof the Reid killings.\n Staffed by faculty and students from both Social Work and\n\nPsychology departments at the University of Manitoba, these individuals work\n\nextremely hard in their attempt to manage a burgeoning high-risk\n\ncaseload.\n The clinic\'s backlog is an ever-present reminder of government\'s\n\ninadequate provision of these essential services. \n\n  When disaster strikes, as it did with the Reid killings, blaming\n\nChild and Family Services agencies for ineffective action is specious; it may\n\nalso serve to promote harm.\n New and inexperienced social workers constitute the cheap labor\n\noption which this government wilfully exploits.\n Often these individuals carry up to 50 cases each; they are relent\n\n<l> lessly overworked and poorly paid. \n\n  The prevention of such horrors as the Reid killings has to be a\n\nfiscal priority in any just society.\n We rely upon government to uphold the principle of distributive\n\njustice through the macroallocation of resources.\n Nothing exotic is being requested here, simply the provision of ade\n\n<l> quate food, shelter, and safety.\n Given the current state of affairs, children\'s basic needs are being\n\ndenied for reasons for which they can not be held responsible, namely their\n\npowerlessness and the fact that life\'s lottery has rendered them dis <l>\n\nadvantaged by birth. \n\n  The words and deeds of Manitoba\'s Department of Family\n\nServices send a clear message to the electorate.\n Our intention is to recede further from our moral obligation to\n\naddress the agonies of children in life-threatening circumstances.\n\n PROFESSOR KATE TUNNA\n School of Nursing\n\n\n\n\n\n  Recently Prime Minister Mulroney co-chaired the World Summit\n\non Children. \n\n  Subsequently, the federal government has announced the\n\nappointment of the Minister of National Health and Welfare as the\n\nminister for children\'s issues and the creation within that department of a\n\nchildren\'s bureau. \n\n  Whilst some commentary on these announcements has been critical,\n\nwe believe it is important to recognize the potential benefits to children of\n\ncreating this responsibility centre within the federal government. \n\n  The Canadian Council on Children and Youth has long advocated\n\nsuch a centre to provide co-ordination of various government departments and\n\nto ensure that policy decisions in any department which impact on children\n\nwill recognize that impact. \n\n  It is also important to note that these announcements demonstrate\n\nimplementation of the first two recommendations of the Report on Child\n\nSexual Abuse of the Special Policy Adviser on this subject, Rix Rogers (\n\nReaching for Solutions). \n\n  Child sexual abuse and child poverty represent two of the\n\nmost common urgent problems which must be dealt with if Canada\'s chil <l>\n\ndren are to have acceptable lives as they grow and develop into adults. \n\n  The next step should be the early announcement of the leadership\n\nand staffing of the bureau together with a budget appropriate to its complex\n\ntasks. \n\n  Strong leadership, extensive expertise and an appropriate\n\nbudget for the bureau will help establish its credibility and demonstrate\n\nthat the federal government\'s commitment to children is real and ongoing.\n\n\n\n  It is easy to dismiss such announcements as having little\n\nsignificance for Canada\'s million poor children or many abused children.\n But it is through the creation of a structure to deal with those prob\n\n<l> lems that the federal government may finally be able to come to grips\n\nwith these issues. \n\n  Those of us who care for Canada\'s children and advocate for\n\nsolutions to their problems should at least be ready to applaud these signs\n\nof the government\'s interest in children and to encourage the federal govern\n\n<l> ment to translate that interest into the implementation of policies which\n\nwill actually serve the needs of those children. \n C. ROBIN WALKER\n President, Canadian Council on Children and YouthOttawa, Ont.\n\n\n\n\n Loyal fans subject to shabby treatment on arena\n\nquestion   \n\n  game last month\n\nwhen the Boston Bruins were in town, I left the arena somewhat shocked and\n\nconfused.\n I was stunned.\n\n\nedgeable and polite. \n\n  For the past five years, my family and I have lived in Boston,\n\nand on more than one occasion have ventured into the less than friendly\n\nconfines of the Garden.\n Suffice it to say the Garden is a literal trash heap compared to the\n\nWinnipeg Arena.\n It would be fair to say that the Bruin faithful would kill to have a\n\nhome rink as nice as the Winnipeg Arena, compared to the vulgarity, obscene\n\ngestures and the stench of stale beer at the Garden. \n\n  Another interesting point is that the owners of the Garden and\n\nthe Bruins - The Deleware North Corporation - have promised either a new\n\nGarden or at least a refurbished one.\n They made this promise six years ago, and I really doubt if a new\n\nfacility will be erected for at least another five years. \n\n  Keep in mind that they did not demand anything from the City of\n\nBoston, and that this situation is made more complicated by the Garden\n\nalso being part of a major train and trolley hub called North Station.\n Whether a new arena in Boston is developed or not is beside the\n\npoint, it is preposterous to entertain ideas of the Bruins playing anywhere\n\nbut Boston. \n\n  In the same vein, it would be ludicrous for the Jets to be any\n\n<l> where but Winnipeg.\n The all-or-nothing arena issue that has been presented by Jets\n\nmanagement is not fair to the fans who have supported the Jets since their\n\nconception.\n Now, I am sure that I do not fully understand the situation, but a\n\ncompromise of some degree should be entertained.\n Furthermore, the citizens of this city deserve better than this\n\nshabby treatment from an organization that they have been loyal to for many\n\nyears. \n\n  Everyone realizes that the addition of private boxes in a\n\nnew arena would be lucrative and desirable but, until the Jets and their\n\nmanagement establish a proven track record of success, only then should a new\n\nbuilding be developed. \n\n  It\'s funny, but if any franchise is deserving of a new building\n\nit is the Bruins.\n The Garden supports two major franchises and countless college /\n\nuniversity events.\n This place is filthy, the fans are extremely rude and the building is\n\nbeginning to decay.\n This is not to mention the occasional Green Line rodent that wants to\n\nmingle with the fans. \n\n  The fans of the Bruins and the Celtics flock to this place in\n\ndroves and usually sell the place out.\n The reason is obviously not the Garden.\n The Bruins work extremely hard game in and out, and play a fairly\n\ndecent brand of hockey. \n\n  As for the Jets and the Winnipeg Arena, things could be much\n\nworse.\n The arena is a clean facility, it is comfortable and a nice\n\nplace to watch a game.\n Even with their slow start, the Jets seem to be on the threshold of\n\ngreatness.\n It may not happen this year, and I doubt if it will without the\n\naddition of a scorer or two.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '3128afac-2927-40d8-b550-42aa9f7984b5', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.923032+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9737251996994019, 'non_english_score': 0.026274800300598145}
{'text': 'What all gun nuts, pro-life bigots and tax rebels share: a\n\nbelief in democratic freedom  \n\n  Owners of exotic firearms are upset these days because Ottawa has\n\nundertaken to " prohibit" ( i.e., steal) guns that have hitherto been\n\nlegal.\n Conservative family activists are upset these days because public\n\nbureaucracy at all three levels continues its subtle and sinister intrusion\n\ninto private life.\n Taxpayers are upset these days because politicians continue to borrow\n\nmulti-billion-dollar gobs of money on their account, thus destroying any hope\n\nof continued prosperity for future generations. \n\n  It is worth noting that people in all three groups - gun owners,\n\nfamily activists and tax objectors - are mercilessly ridiculed in the media\n\nand studiously ignored by most politicians.\n Gun collectors are portrayed as power-tripping, vaguely dangerous\n\neccentrics.\n Family lobbyists are presumed to be sexually repressed religious\n\nparanoids.\n Tax objectors are presented as truculent cheapskates who would let\n\nhumanity starve in the streets. \n\n  As long as the indifferent, docile and gullible mass can be kept\n\nthinking in such idiotic stereotypes, of course, governments can continue to\n\nswell and bloat and push everybody around, which is the unhealthy first\n\ninstinct of all large bureaucracies everywhere.\n Gun control, for example.\n Proponents have never established, or even attempted to establish,\n\nhow restricting firearms will reduce criminal violence, and there is not a\n\nsingle reason to think it would.\n But why would they bother?\n Everyone knows that gun nuts are weirdos.\n\n\nreputable  onlookers cheer. \n\n  The same goes for pro-life family activists.\n Sociological surveys find that they are on average more tolerant of\n\nracial and religious difference, more generous with their time and money, and\n\nmore prone to forgive offence than anyone else.\n They are, in short, very principled people.\n But that doesn\'t matter.\n They also believe on principle that it should be illegal to murder\n\nprenatal infants, however inconvenient this prohibition may sometimes be.\n Because the current leadership of the country long ago\n\nsubstituted happy-face self-interest as the basis of government instead of\n\nreasoned convictions, pro-lifers are routinely savaged as narrow-minded\n\nbigots. \n\n  Advocates of tax reduction share the same fate.\n It is just plain wrong, they assert, to tax future generations for\n\nthings that government and its massive fiefdom of interest groups are\n\nneedlessly consuming today.\n Do governments ever answer this criticism?\n No, because they don\'t need to.\n Everybody knows that tax objectors are just greedy, self-interested\n\nsocial misfits. \n\n  It is no random accident that all three of these groups are in\n\nbad odour with the self-serving elites which run our political parties,\n\ncourts, schools, public bureaucracies and daily newspapers.\n All three, each in its own way, believe that government has become\n\nfar too big and is sticking the public nose where it has no business being.\n As the elites become more and more blatant and arrogant, the instinct\n\ngrows among ordinary men to tear down all the elites and turn over control\n\ndirectly to the people through mechanisms like initiative, referendum and\n\nrecall. \n\n  This is well worth doing, but unbridled democracy alone could\n\neasily become a cure worse than the disease.\n We long ago ceased to be a very principled population.\n It was we who allowed the present elites to go on a spending spree\n\nwith the accumulated moral and financial capital of the nation, and once\n\nsomething is gone it is gone.\n People are now very comfortable deciding how disproportionate a\n\ntax their richer neighbours will pay; with " experts" dictating how we will\n\nraise our children and which amoral doctrines will be taught in our schools;\n\nwith government knowing every last detail of our personal lives, political\n\nactivities and finances.\n So long have we cocooned ourselves in this democratic\n\ntotalitarianism, most of us can scarcely imagine any other existence. \n\n  A truly free democracy builds up other institutions independent\n\nof government or it becomes nothing more than a roving mob looking for loot.\n First and foremost, it does not intrude into family life and the\n\nraising and teaching of children.\n It gives to the family a small institutional sovereignty all its own.\n Secondly, it honours religious institutions which teach about God and\n\nright and wrong.\n These do not exist for civic purposes, and in some ways they are\n\nindeed " intolerant."\n But they alone serve as a bulwark against the baser instincts of man,\n\nespecially envy, which is blood poison in a free state. \n\n  Canada was once such a democracy, and it can be again.\n But whether it will find the necessary courage and intelligence to\n\nsave itself depends, if you think about it, upon you. \n\n\n\n A bold and merry adventure in quest of sticks and bones\n\n \n\n  There are few pastimes more pleasant than taking young boys on a\n\nlong tramp through the autumn hills.\n I had five in my platoon two weekends ago, ranging from five years to\n\n10: three of my own and two of a neighbour\'s who had left them for the\n\nweekend. \n\n  in favour\n\nof a hike on a cold day it is best to bring out a packsack and involve them\n\nin the decision-making process.\n How many hotdogs?\n Twelve.\n Should we bring a knife?\n Yes.\n Wax paper for kindling?\n Check.\n Fruit gums?\n Yes.\n Juice boxes?\n Yes.\n Quartz power-rock?\n No.\n Small bit of poplar stick shaped vaguely like a Smith and Wesson?\n No.\n How far are we going?\n Oh, a few miles.\n\n\n  We strike southwest across Gordon\'s pasture.\n The trees are bare, the sky and grass faded and dull, and the slow\n\nnorthwest wind smells of snow.\n We will see no deer or coyotes, though the woods are full of them,\n\nbecause boys simply cannot shut up.\n\n\n\n Gales of shrill hilarity ring through the silent hills.\n\n\n  We soon come upon our first major find: bones.\n The brushy pastures are strewn with bleached skeletons of cattle.\n Bones speak with silent authority of the twin mysteries of antiquity\n\nand death.\n One boy takes a jawbone, another a shoulder blade another an\n\ninteresting section of crumbling spine. \n\n  Crossing a gravel road, several of the boys claim there is a No\n\nTrespassing sign barring entrance to the next quarter.\n Try as I may I can\'t see anything of the sort.\n Besides, even if there were a sign, it would be meant for strangers,\n\nnot neighbours who know how to cross fences without wrecking them.\n Had they ever heard of Lord Nelson turning his famous blind eye?\n At the sea battle of Copenhagen in 1801, one-eyed vice-admiral\n\nNelson was sailing in upon the enemy, all guns firing off the starboard, when\n\nhis overly cautious commander signalled him to withdraw.\n Nelson closed his good eye, raised his telescope to his blind one,\n\nand said he could see no such signal on the flagship.\n He continued his attack, won the battle and was made a viscount.\n Moral: you may disobey authority for a good reason, as long as you\'re\n\nwilling to take responsibility for it.\n Had Lord Nelson lost, he would have suffered some dreadful\n\npunishment. \n\n  After a congenial luncheon, at which the children discuss the\n\nphenomenon of digestive flatulence and try smoking hollow stems of grass, we\n\nextinguish our fire with dirt from an old anthill, stow our empty juice boxes\n\nafter stamping on them to make them pop, and press on.\n Our total course is three miles southwest to the toboggan hill, two\n\nmiles north to the Sandy Lake hill, and three miles home across the Indian\n\nreserve. \n\n  Along the way, we exchange bones and spent shotgun cartridges\n\nevery other mile or so as we encounter new ones.\n We examine the ancient rusting tractor with steel wheels.\n We find something called a " " fork-leaf clover." "\n We find an aluminum arrow, now bent and useless but apparently worth\n\nkeeping.\n The nine-year-old, head tucked between his clamped knees,\n\naccomplishes a terrifying " thud-butt" roll down Sandy Lake hill.\n We startle 20 grazing buffalo in the Indian pasture and they run off\n\nin a minor but thrilling stampede.\n We find four young swallows dead in a nest inside the lonely leaning\n\nlog cabin by the slough where an Indian couple lived before welfare and free\n\nhousing came to the Cree.\n We stand and look up in awe inside this year\'s great poplar sundance\n\nlodge, festooned with hanging sheets of coloured cloth, fading and rustling\n\nin the cold, sighing breeze.\n No, they may not take any cloth - it\'s a gift to God.\n\n\n  After five hours, down the last hill we tumble and tramp into our\n\nown yard, hungry, tired and cold.\n .\n It occurs to me that they were just as happy marching along with\n\narmloads of useless bones and whacking trees with odd-shaped sticks as they\n\nare now watching a multi-million dollar video on an expensive\n\nhome-electronics gadget.\n It occurs to me that we modern fathers too readily give our children\n\nvideos and too readily deprive them of sore feet.\n It occurs to me, as I fall asleep to the sound of phasers and\n\nKlingon war rhetoric, that I don\'t do this sort of thing often enough. \n\n\n\n Take note of the CRPP - it has undertaken a magnificent\n\ntask  \n\n  Twenty years ago - long before I had settled upon any political\n\nposition - I heard an interview with Michael Walker on CBC radio\'s \n\nAs It Happens  .\n I don\'t remember exactly what he said or even the specific subject.\n In those days I was interested in farming, not political economy.\n Yet I was struck by the clarity and confidence with which the\n\nfounder of the new Fraser Institute advanced his free-market argument.\n In an age of complacent acceptance of mixed economy,\n\nTrudeau-style socialism, here was an articulate champion of Adam Smith\n\nliberalism meeting and beating Barbara Frum.\n Everything he said offended conventional wisdom; yet it made\n\nperfect sense. \n\n  It would take 10 years for Dr. Walker to convert me and millions\n\nof others to a genuine enthusiasm for free enterprise.\n It would take 15 years for mass-membership organizations like the\n\nCanadians Taxpayers Federation to start translating Dr. Walker\'s ideas into a\n\npolitical imperative.\n And it would take 20 years before Canadian governments reached the\n\npoint of action.\n But it happened; or at least it has begun to happen.\n Yet it would not have happened if Dr. Walker, along with\n\nperhaps a hundred like-minded academics, had not spent the last two decades\n\n making  it happen. \n\n  Well, for what it is worth, I had a vivid sense of the same\n\n20-year phenomenon at a lunch last week.\n Five of us local media people had been invited to meet three\n\nacademic promoters of something new called the Centre for Renewal in Public\n\nPolicy ( CRPP).\n The name alone is such a snoozer I wasn\'t sure if I had heard of\n\nthis organization before or not.\n But as the meeting progressed, I found myself getting more and more\n\ninterested. \n\n  The CRPP wants to revive the idea of right and wrong, and to re\n\n<l> formulate public policy on moral absolutes as they have been tra <l>\n\nditionally understood in Judeo-Christian culture.\n To this end it has assembled a formidable board of directors and\n\nnetwork of scholarly contacts - Catholic, Protestant and Jewish.\n It has secured some start-up funds from the Donner Foundation, is\n\nbusy soliciting memberships, and has begun publishing papers. \n\n  Those of us who do not live and work in academe too often\n\ndismiss its patient labour as aimless chatter, because very often that is all\n\nit ever amounts to and nothing much ever seems to come of it.\n Nothing, that is, except liberalism, communism, feminism,\n\natheism, pragmatism, positivism, materialism, relativism, pluralism and\n\na hundred other things which over time come to run our lives and ruin our\n\nschools, hospitals, governments, courts, businesses and families. \n\n  The CRPP acknowledges that all the human and liberal disciplines\n\nhave departed a million miles from their old Judeo-Christian intellectual\n\norigins, and have as a result become mired in irrational contradictions.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '11031cea-4cab-4689-9863-ddccf4117749', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.924291+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9707949161529541, 'non_english_score': 0.0292050838470459}
{'text': 'No one would ever know she was lying.\n Hannah shifted in her desk, third from the front, and waited for the\n\nfirst morning bell.\n Christmas decorations still coloured the room in red and green paper\n\nchains, gold Bethlehem stars and silver holiday trees.\n Angels decorated the four windows, blessing each person who entered\n\nthe grade three classroom.\n Someone had written " " Happy New Year" " across the\n\nentire length of the blackboard. \n\n  After the bell rang, Miss Brown rapped on her desk with a ruler\n\nand the children all turned to the front.\n Twenty-eight students; many of their cheeks were reddened from\n\nplaying outdoors, others still glowed from the excitement of holidays.\n Hannah\'s face was pale and she chewed on her lower lip as the class\n\nsettled.\n\n\n  The teacher looked fresh in a new soft pink turtleneck, probably\n\na gift from her    fiancé   ,\n\nthought Hannah.\n Her dark blue pants made her appear slimmer than she really was.\n Hannah had hoped that she would be wearing the apple-red dress she\n\nhad worn to the Christmas concert, with the dainty lace collar and pearl\n\ndrops at her ears, but it didn\'t matter.\n\n\n  How happy Hannah had been on that night, up on stage with all the\n\nother children, singing,  " Winter Wonderland." \n The girls swayed in time with the music, the boys rang the\n\ntambourines. \n\n  ? "\n\n ( ring, ring)\n ( ring,\n\nring)\n Even Johnny Hawkins, who always pulled her braids and made up dirty\n\nlyrics in music class, was singing along that night.\n\n\n  When the song was over, the applause burst from the audience of\n\nparents, grandparents, teachers and fellow students, and Hannah thought it\n\nwas the most beautiful sound she had ever heard.\n Without thinking, she had clapped as well, until all her classmates\n\nwere looking at her and her face burned redder than Miss Brown\'s velvet\n\ndress. \n\n  " You don\'t clap for yourself, stupid," said Tracy Dyck from\n\nbehind her.\n\n\n  Hannah returned to her seat in the gym but her neck continued to\n\nburn; through  " Jingle Bell Rock,"   " Joy to the\n\nWorld,"  and finally,  " Deck the Halls."  \n\n  Her mother decided they had better not stay afterward for\n\ncoffee.\n Hannah was glad.\n She stumbled in the snow as she ran toward the car and waited on the\n\nfreezing seat for her mother and sister to follow. \n\n  " Hannah, I really enjoyed the concert," her mother assured her.\n She rubbed her gloved hands together while the big car slowly came to\n\nlife.\n Mary, her older sister, snickered beside her and Hannah felt the heat\n\nrise to her face once again.\n She pulled the thick scarf around her, shielding her tears from them\n\nboth. \n\n  " Daddy wanted to come," her mother said.\n " He\'s just not feeling too well tonight, girls.\n\n\n  It was a silent ride home.\n Mother didn\'t like the girls to talk when the roads were slippery.\n The moon had disappeared behind mountains of black clouds, so it was\n\ndark, too.\n If they slid off the narrow road that snaked toward their farm, it\n\nmight be hours before anyone found them.\n Her father would be furious, having to come out with the truck\n\non such a stormy December night, especially when he " wasn\'t feeling too\n\nwell," as her mother put it. \n\n  Hannah knew that her father\'s frequent illnesses had something to\n\ndo with the old yellow cupboard in the cellar.\n after\n\nhe\'d been into the cupboard and the smelly brown bottles it contained. \n\n  Hannah pressed her nose against the cold window and searched for\n\na lone star in the blackness. \n\n  " I wish I may, I wish I might, had not been so dumb tonight."\n\n\n\n  At home, the girls quickly returned their dresses to hangers and\n\nplaced them at the back of the closet.\n Hannah knew it would be a long time before they would need them\n\nagain.\n She was happy to take off the scratchy woolen jumper and creamy\n\nhigh-collared blouse.\n They made her feel like something was crawling up the back of her\n\nneck to her hair.\n She couldn\'t imagine what it was like to have to dress up every\n\nSunday, like Melody and Mary Ellen who went to the United Church and were\n\nawarded gold pins for perfect attendance.\n There was no end to their dresses, as far as Hannah could see: yellow\n\nand orange cotton sundresses for summer, dark skirts and matching sweaters\n\nfor winter. \n\n  Johnny Hawkins liked it when they wore dresses to school.\n He would drop his eraser or pencil on the floor, then crouch down and\n\nsneak peeks between their legs.\n At recess, he would tell all the other boys what colour panties they\n\nwere wearing. \n\n  If the girls caught him, they\'d let out high-pitched squeals, the\n\nway rats do when they\'re shot.\n Then Miss Brown would make Johnny sit in the corner, facing the other\n\nstudents. \n\n  Breakfast was porridge and brown sugar.\n They\'d had oranges over Christmas, a gift from Mr. Olson in town.\n Hannah longed for that sweetness again.\n Even the brightness of colour would be nice on this cold dark\n\nmorning. \n\n  Reader\'s\n\nDigest  while she waited for the coffee to brew.\n She seemed so tired in her faded beige housedress.\n Hannah could see the outline of flowers on the dress, but couldn\'t\n\nremember what they looked like before they had begun to disappear.\n Miss Brown would never wear anything like that, Hannah thought.\n Her mother did not use make-up and seldom fixed her hair.\n\n\n  " Why bother?\n No one is coming out here to visit and it\'s not my day to go into\n\ntown." \n\n  Go into town.\n Hannah recalled that scorching day last July when she went with her\n\nmother to deliver the eggs.\n Her mother pulled the old truck to a stop in front of a flat,\n\nmustard-coloured home.\n A bungalow, Hannah had heard them called.\n She applied her shoulder to the sticking truck door, which slowly\n\ncreaked open.\n It reminded Hannah of the sound Dracula\'s coffin made when it opened.\n She had watched the movie with her sister and cousin Rose two years\n\nearlier, and still wouldn\'t look into mirrors when she was alone, for fear\n\nher reflection would not stare back. \n\n  Hannah followed her mother across the street and admired the\n\nmarigolds and pansies that welcomed them to the house.\n Her mother was wearing the navy dress she had bought on sale at\n\nKresge\'s, but had slippers on her feet.\n Slippers, Hannah cringed, she hadn\'t even bothered to put on shoes.\n Her mother poked a stray hair behind one ear and Hannah noticed the\n\ndark stain under her arm as she did. \n\n  The door was opened by a slim blonde-haired lady whose thin dark\n\neyebrows formed a perfect arc over her icy blue eyes. \n\n  " Who is it, Mom?"\n A girl\'s voice called from inside the house.\n\n\n  " No one.\n It\'s just the egg lady," the woman called back.\n She opened a purple sequined wallet and Hannah gazed at her long\n\npointed fingernails. \n\n  " Here\'s two dollars," said the lady, whose eyes were ice.\n She handed the money to Hannah\'s mother, who reached for it with\n\ndirty fingers. \n\n  Walking back to the truck, Hannah felt someone was watching and\n\nshe turned to look again at the house.\n She caught a glimpse of blonde ringlets before the girl vanished\n\nbehind the gold curtain.\n\n\n \n\n  " Hey, Hannah, what did one egg say to the other egg?\n\n\n  " Hey, little egg lady, did you hear the one about the mean chef?\n\n\n  And later, when Spin the Bottle and Truth or Dare were popular in\n\nthe Melody and Johnny Hawkins crowd\n\n \n\nget laid?" \n\n  matter, you\n\nchicken?" \n\n  After breakfast, Hannah heard her father cough and spit in the\n\nbathroom as she sat on the wooden bench outside the front door.\n Smoker\'s cough.\n She\'d never smoke when she grew up.\n\n\n  Mary was looking out the window beside her.\n " There\'s the bus, hurry up slowpoke."\n Mary pushed her out the door into the blowing snow.\n Hannah took her seat at the back of the bus and peeked into her\n\npocket to make sure everything was still there. \n\n  The snow crunched underneath the bus wheels, a sound Hannah\n\nloved.\n She surveyed the farm as it got smaller behind her; the three-storey\n\nhouse capped with three feet of snow, the leaning tool shed, abandoned\n\nmachinery and the chicken house, all disappeared in a swirl of white.\n It wasn\'t until years later that she learned it wasn\'t really even\n\ntheir farm.\n Her father was renting the land from the Credit Union manager in\n\ntown. \n\n  At school, Miss Brown welcomed them back and called out the\n\nnames for attendance &dotted-line; \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Miss Brown looked pleased that no one was absent.\n Even poor Christopher Donald, who\'d had a sudden outbreak of chicken\n\npox just before the Christmas concert, had recovered and was now back in\n\nschool.\n His freckled pink skin was free from the ugly scabs that had covered\n\nHannah\'s body when she\'d had chicken pox.\n Her mother said that Christopher was the only child she knew who got\n\nchicken pox each year at Christmas and she thought it was such a ridiculous\n\nlie.\n\n\n  The day seemed to drag.\n Was the clock even moving?\n\n\n  " Hannah.\n Hannah.\n\n\n  The children could hardly sit still, waiting for the last hour\n\nwhen Show and Tell would begin.\n Christmas treasures poked out of bags and boxes where nervous\n\nparents had written, " This belongs to &dotted-line;" on the sides. \n\n  Hannah had everything planned, but it was taking such a long\n\ntime.\n Melody skipped to the front of the class, carrying a doll that came\n\nup to her waist.\n Its yellow ringlets were the same colour as Melody\'s own unnatural\n\ncurls. \n\n  " &dotted-line; and a puppy from Grandpa, and two bottles of\n\n&dotted-line;" \n\n  Hannah looked at the clock again.\n The big hand was already at the three, there wasn\'t much time left.\n Hurry up, Melody, hurry up about your stupid old doll and pyjamas\n\nwith feet. \n\n  " Thank you Melody, I\'d say Santa Claus was very generous at\n\nyour house this year.\n Hannah, have you brought any gifts that you\'d like to show the\n\nclass?" \n\n  Hannah slid out of her desk and took her place at the front.\n She could feel that her palms were sweating, and she wiped them on\n\nher jeans before she spoke. \n\n  " My Mom wouldn\'t let me bring my presents to school, in case\n\nthey got broken or dirty, but Santa came to my house too, and I can show you\n\npictures of everything I got." \n\n  Hannah dug into her pocket and one by one, pulled out the shiny\n\ncrumpled pictures which she\'d carefully cut out of the Sears catalogue.\n She showed them the toys first; Barbie and Ken, a doll that could\n\nwet, a walkie talkie set, a Spirograph, a children\'s typewriter, and a blue\n\nKrazy Karpet.\n Then there were games; Clue, Monopoly, Battling Tops, and Operation.\n\n\n\n  Hannah left the clothes for last; a pair of pink corduroy pants\n\nand a blouse of the same colour, pyjamas with straps that went under her\n\nfeet, fuzzy green slippers, black patent shoes, various dresses but none that\n\nwas " scratchy," several sweaters including one with Snoopy on it, and a long\n\nblue coat trimmed with white fur. \n\n  Mary Ellen whispered something to Melody, but Miss Brown was\n\nquick to curtail them. \n\n  " Girls, listen, please.\n\n\n  Hannah finished showing the pictures and returned to her desk\n\nwith all the gifts hidden again in her pocket.  \n Johnny and Melody looked at one another, then at Hannah as the\n\nfinal bell rang.\n Hannah could hear them talking as she walked into the cloak room\n\nand pulled her worn boots from the rack.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '81fe5515-a405-412b-bad0-7f8b046616b9', 'added':

{'text': 'We used to live in Chicago which I never much liked.\n Summers were always hot and humid and in winter the wind cut right\n\nthrough any protective clothing.\n Too many people, too much decay.\n Before we moved to Calgary we were living in a small rented flat with\n\nmost of our things in storage.\n Laura had insisted I sell the house.\n A Chicago police detective called us one day and told us they\'d caught\n\na burglar who had confessed to robbing our house.\n Why hadn\'t I reported the burglary?\n There must have been some mistake, I told him.\n Was my name Jeff?\n Was my wife\'s name Laura?\n Had I given her a silver and diamond necklace with an inscription on\n\nthe clasp?\n The burglary had taken place more than a month before the phone call\n\nand we hadn\'t known.\n We weren\'t the first people not to know they\'d been robbed, he\n\nexplained.\n Especially when the guy was a real pro like the one they\'d caught.\n But Laura made me sell the house.\n It made her feel violated and vulnerable she told me.\n What\'s the difference?\n I\'d asked.\n We\'d been living there over a month since it happened and never even\n\nnoticed.\n\n\n  Things were never very pleasant in Chicago after that.\n Even for Laura.\n I got a great offer from The University of Calgary medical school and\n\nthe Foothills Hospital Department of Pediatrics to be on staff and teach.\n Laura hadn\'t wanted to leave but when she visited she liked Calgary.\n Walking around the neighbourhood of the hospital she saw a beautiful\n\nlittle house we eventually bought.\n It was bigger than the house in Chicago but not too big.\n A nice family house that would be great for kids.\n She thought it was funny I was a pediatrician and didn\'t want kids.\n How can you tell other people how to take care of their kids?\n You don\'t know, she said.\n Not yet, I told her.\n\n\n  I\'d walked to work that day.\n I went home now along the winding sidewalks, feeling the warmth of\n\nthe sunset on my back.\n I was surprised by the late September orange, red, and pale\n\nyellow-greens of the trees.\n When had they changed?\n I\'d been planning to take Laura out to dinner but I\'d had to cancel\n\nwhen the clinic filled up at five o\'clock.\n Laura said she\'d microwave a slice of the frozen pizza we\'d brought\n\nwith us from Chicago.\n\n\n  The streetlamp in front of the house was already on.\n Coming up the long stairs in the front yard I felt tired and had to\n\nrest.\n It was past eight o\'clock already, despite the sunset.\n I thought about when I could get to the yard work.\n The leaves were going to need raking and there was some kind of weed\n\nthat had choked off and killed a bush in the hedge. \n\n  When I came inside, I could hear Joni Mitchell playing loudly,\n\nwhich is always a bad sign.\n Laura was in the TV room downstairs on the old armchair with her legs\n\ndrawn up under her singing along and crying. \n\n \n\n  " &dotted-line; and her heart\n\nis full and hollow like a cactus tree while she\'s so busy being free."\n\n \n\n  I hate it when she sings Joni Mitchell songs to me.\n I don\'t know what she\'s talking about.\n I sat on the padded armrest next to her and slid my hand over her\n\nshoulders.\n She hunched her shoulders and turned her head sideways and the\n\nmuscles thumped against each other.\n Her shoulders hurt her all the time and she cracks them to relieve\n\nthe ache.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  " Lucy just called me from the hospital.\n They think she\'s got a concussion.\n\n\n \n\n  " No, she\'s not alright.\n Her husband hit her over the head with a goddamn chair and she\'s got\n\na goddamn concussion.\n\n\n \n\n  " No.\n\n\n \n\n  " How should I know if she\'s got any friends?\n She doesn\'t have any family because her sister lives in goddamn\n\nCalgary." \n\n \n\n  " God.\n\n\n  " Probably Rush.\n She\'s near there.\n I know some people at Rush.\n I\'ll call Bill Weddington."\n I said.\n\n\n  " He\'s a pediatrician.\n You\'re a pediatrician.\n What do you know?\n\n\n  I listened to the needle click on the empty bands at the end of\n\nthe Joni Mitchell record then I got up and turned it off.\n When I put the record away Laura said, " I don\'t want to hear any\n\nmore Joni Mitchell." \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  " No, nothing.\n\n\n  " No.\n\n\n  " If Lucy asked me to I would have been gone already.\n\n\n \n\n  " She shouldn\'t have to ask.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  " I need some tea."\n I didn\'t want to have this conversation now.\n I knew what she was going to say and what I was going to say and how\n\nit\'d end.\n\n\n  Laura was talking while the water ran into the electric kettle.\n Laura was talking when I plugged it in and the heating coils hissed\n\nand bubbled.\n She came up the stairs and the kettle began to whistle.\n I picked out something decaffeinated.\n\n\n  " Jeff!\n\n\n  Laura stood at the top of the stairs glaring furiously at me.\n\n\n  " Honey, you know I can\'t hear anything with the racket that\n\nthing makes." \n\n \n\n  " I was listening but you were downstairs and the kettle was\n\non."\n I squeezed the tea bag and tossed it into the garbage.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  " It doesn\'t mean anything when you ask.\n You just ask because you think you should ask.\n You asked me if I would mind moving to Calgary and I told you I\n\nwould damn well mind and did you care?"\n Laura said.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  " But can you imagine?\n\n\n  Laura looked at me with her head twisted.\n I thought she was going to crack her shoulders again but she was\n\njust looking.\n\n\n \n\n  " He had to have a reason.\n\n\n  " You\'re as sick a bastard as he is.\n , to hit\n\nsomeone over the head with a chair?"\n\n\n  " Let\'s sit down, honey."\n I tried to slip my arm around her waist and move her into the living\n\nroom but she hit my arm.\n Hard.\n I went ahead and sat down in my chair.\n I blew on the tea and listened to Laura rattle bottles on the\n\nrefrigerator door.\n Something would fall when she slammed it.\n Oyster sauce.\n She would clean it up right away and somehow that would calm her.\n\n\n\n  " Honey," I said.\n\n\n  " I\'m not going to slam the door.\n Okay?\n\n\n  Laura brought me some cut up lemon.\n I wanted to hug her but she\'d just push my arm away.\n She was thinking of something else.\n Standing by the chair, holding the plate with the lemon, looking out\n\nthe picture window.\n Weak orange sunlight seeped in now the trees were half bare.\n Tiny threads and dust motes hung in the light beams.\n I looked at them and wondered what kept them up.\n Just waiting out Laura.\n The plate in her hand dipped and I finally reached up and took it\n\nfrom her. \n\n  " Thanks, honey.\n\n\n  Now she started to cry.\n I put the cup and the plate of lemons down, stood and hugged her,\n\nrunning my hand over her aching neck and letting her rich brown hair slip\n\nsmooth and cool through my fingers.\n She dug her face into my chest, wrapped her arms around my bony hips\n\nand hugged me back, smelling like cashews and lemons, crying in the light\n\nshafts. \n\n  " How can you think there\'s a reason?" Laura said.\n\n\n  " To think he must have a reason?\n I\'m not saying he\'s got any excuse for hitting her.\n\n\n \n\n  " Jerry?\n He does all our taxes, he wrote our wills, he makes most of our\n\ninvestments." \n\n  " It\'s not the same," Laura said.\n " When it comes to love it isn\'t the same.\n Some men act crazy when it comes to love.\n You\'re not like that.\n You don\'t know.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  I didn\'t say anything.\n\n\n  Laura started laughing.\n I loved to hear her laugh.\n It was a low sexy throaty laugh.\n In college when she asked me why I loved her I used to say it was\n\nbecause of her laugh and the way she smelled like roasted cashews.\n " You remember when you hit yourself with the chair?"

{'text': 'Evelyn Lau\n\n  Each morning when the child psychiatrist wakes up, he goes into\n\nthe bathroom and talks to his reflection in the mirror.\n " You\'re an asshole," he says out loud, pausing for a moment before\n\ntwisting the tap and letting the water run down the drain in a cold white\n\ncolumn. \n\n  The story of the child psychiatrist is a good place to start.\n His name had sounded familiar to me but even when I told you there was\n\na good possibility that I knew him, you went on with his secrets after only a\n\nmoment of consideration for the trust that had been placed in you.\n I kept picturing this man telling himself he was an asshole while\n\nlooking levelly at his reflection and I was certain we had at some point met,\n\ncrossed paths in the labyrinth of offices and mental health centres and\n\nhospitals.\n Finally one evening I thumbed through some old journals and saw that\n\nhe had treated me once, very briefly, after a feeble suicide attempt during\n\nwhich I had walked into the nearest hospital raising loud, coarse demands for\n\nattention.\n Oh, I was never like one of the patients you favour, the one you\n\nalways visit before you visit me, condensing our faces and bodies into one\n\nand emptying out your remaining lust for her into me.\n I could never have been so brave as her, to push a shotgun under my\n\nchin and pull the trigger.\n You love her for her suffering beauty, for the scar tissue gathered\n\njust under her cheek-bone where the bullet erupted, veering off its path.\n I wish often that she had died, but then it would have been someone\n\nelse; there are so many wounded people to choose from.\n And then there is that woman doctor you fell in love with.\n This is the order, then: you visit the patient you love and cannot\n\ntouch, and then you bring your longing for her to me to discard, and then \x97\n\nin trying to forget this \x97 you visit the doctor who is now married and has a\n\nnewborn child.\n I wish I could have been like either of them, that brave or that\n\neducated.\n I am neither.\n I remain caught in the middle gathering your confessions to me like\n\nstones. \n\n  " You don\'t understand," you tell me when I confront you with\n\nthese things.\n " Maybe one day when you\'re forty you\'ll understand, in here."\n Your hand depresses your chest, the flower-patterned tie.\n\n\n  It would be grand to have such a monopoly on loneliness, on any\n\nemotion, but you do not.\n I look after you in a helpless fury as you walk away from me,\n\ncollecting briefcases and pocket watches and a triumph that colours your eyes\n\nlike trees on summer evenings when the fading light washes through the\n\nleaves, clear and jade.\n A smile curves your lips in satisfaction.\n I know that feeling of power rising in your chest, filling up the\n\nhole there.\n Watching you inside your suit, the flesh crumpled around your eyes, I\n\nhalf expect you to say something clinical and depressing like, " I never\n\nsuspected your psychopathology ran so deep."\n Instead you say you want the best for me, you have never done\n\nanything to hurt me, is it so terrible to be loved by you? \n\n  No, it would not be so terrible if the capacity to love existed\n\nwithin you.\n I watch you straighten your tie and your notes - you scribble on\n\npaper printed with things like, " ORAP: Comfortable, effective control for\n\nthe compliant schizophrenic" - and I am suddenly standing helpless, two\n\nlittle fists closed up beside my thighs.\n I stare at you and wish for a shotgun or the beauty and intelligence\n\nof the family doctor who tears you away from me towards banquets and\n\nmassages, which you describe in detail, forcing me to hide my dismay and\n\njealousy in a sudden tightening of the lips and jaw in the same way I hide my\n\ndelight at your occasional dependency, tasting my power like some sweet\n\nthick syrup. \n\n  The child psychiatrist was on duty that night I walked in.\n I was mildly overdosed, demanding a bed and comfort.\n He was running through the ward, surrounded by nurses and clipboards,\n\ncoattails flapping.\n He stopped by to sit on the edge of my bed, as much for a moment of\n\nrest as to look at me and take hidden notes.\n I remember he looked tired, that the flesh gathered darkly around his\n\neyes and his cheekbones.\n You say he is an attractive man, with the sort of appraising lust\n\nthat you display towards anyone you meet because the lust is an emptiness\n\nthat can\'t be filled by anything sexual.\n Yes, I remember there was an attractiveness to his exhaustion when he\n\nsat on the stretched white sheets and we talked for a few minutes.\n I remember asking him to adopt me.\n He smiled and refused in some gentle way.\n I remember rubbing a leg up against him through the sheets and the\n\nblankets as he sat there, partially for reassurance, partially to try\n\nand comfort him, to stroke a little of the weariness from his face.\n And then he was gone and I can only now imagine him the next morning,\n\ntelling himself as though he was another person, " You\'re an asshole," before\n\ndeparting for his office and then later on his rounds at the hospital. \n\n  There were other stories, like the one of the psychiatrist who\n\ntrained you in England.\n He was the only doctor who wasn\'t clenched and critical, who didn\'t\n\ncircle you aggressively, wielding notes on your progress.\n Instead he liked to leap back when he saw you, his eyes opened wide\n\nin exaggerated surprise.\n He would clutch his chest or his forehead and shout, " Oh my God,\n\nsuch brilliance, such brilliance!" at one thing or another that you did,\n\nlightening the harsh walls and corridors and teaching you to laugh.\n He was plump and he always had a kind word, you say.\n While the other psychiatrists watched you grimly, he built you up the\n\nway your father never did, he gave you moments of pleasure which you had to\n\nhoard from the analytical eyes around you.\n British Medical\n\nJournal  dropped into your hands and the obituaries said no one had\n\nglimpsed the depth of his depression, no one had suspected he would go and\n\ncommit suicide like that.\n You told me this after several drinks; I could tell by the way your\n\neyes steeled themselves against the story issuing from your lips that this\n\nwas unlike other hurts.\n You recalled how fat and kindly he was, unlike the other influential\n\nfigures in your life who ironically refuse to die \x97 your father, for\n\ninstance, your other analysts who are almost twice your age.\n To me they seem as good as dead.\n I cannot picture anyone that old, but then I hear they are giving\n\nlectures and marching off to foreign countries to attend eminent\n\npsychoanalytic groups and I find an admiration washing over me like it does\n\nover you, a helpless attraction to their wizened power.\n I think of that psychiatrist in England and how desperate he must\n\nhave been, surrounded by people like that, people like you.\n\n\n  Having so much power must be a terrible thing, an awful\n\ntemptation.\n You can barely contain yourself from telling me about your patients,\n\nasking for my opinion on one case or another, making me believe that I\n\ncould perform in greedy leaps and bounds what you took years and years to\n\nlearn.\n That I could mount a false degree on the wall and sit in a leather\n\narmchair and deal with the tearful arguing couples and the seductive young\n\nwomen in tight dresses and high heels whom you kiss therapeutically on\n\nthe mouth and the young boys you eye secretly with a churning dark passion.\n You make me feel important and almost grotesquely brilliant,\n\nthat if I took your hand you could lead me across all boundaries of morality\n\nand integrity and we would be like two children, exempt from real\n\ncondemnation or punishment. \n\n  " The only problem with you," you tell me often, looking at me\n\nwith a teasing amusement, " is that you are too much of a prude."\n I picture this as someone in sensible shoes and pearls and am shaken\n\nby the image, I try to dance to your complicated tunes, I take your hand, I\n\ntry to follow. \n\n  And so you begin to plan to bring me into your sessions, to pose\n\nme as a psychiatric trainee with a clipboard in my lap and cool, supposedly\n\nscrupulous eyes.\n I still think of how we broke into one of the mental health clinics\n\none evening, the one where the staff had recognized something wrong and fired\n\nyou, and how you took me gleefully from one office to the next.\n You rummaged through papers on desks and volumes of work by\n\nCalifornian psychoanalysts on bookshelves, calling out the names and\n\ndescriptions of the social workers and counsellors you had worked with for\n\nyears.\n " Linda.\n God, she was such a cunt.\n One of those raving feminists &dotted-line;."\n Your former office had been the largest of all.\n I entered each of these rooms with you, meek and delighted at the\n\nsame time, filled with both shame and passion.\n But despite this I was not you, the voyeur in me grew perturbed and\n\nquiet as the tour went on, and when you grabbed for me while sitting on one\n\nof the therapist\'s desks, kissing me, laughing with delight at this\n\ntransgression, I wanted to leave. \n\n  I can pretend to be a victim here, to have been utterly misled by\n\nyou, to have been helpless.\n Or I can pretend to be a manipulative young woman who seduced you in\n\na crazy and clever way, who exposed your secrets and destroyed your\n\nreputation.\n The dangerous thing is that we can look at our relationship from any\n\nangle, and each of these angles will hold its own truth.\n The twisting is so subtle.\n I could present this story in any light without having to tell a\n\nsingle lie. \n\n  But there is no sense now in playing those games.\n I think that after everything, there is only the pathos, which holds\n\nno special knowledge or glamour.\n How I used to thrill to your stories of some of the most eminent\n\ndoctors in our city, reduced to nothing but people \x97 and rather appalling\n\npeople at that \x97 like the psychiatrist who enjoyed masturbating dogs, or the\n\nanalysts who were being investigated for sexual abuse after they had done\n\nundeniably excellent work with adolescents or borderline personalities\n\nor schizophrenics. \n\n  I think of the time I slashed my wrists after one of our fights\n\nand you, who have seen so many slashed wrists in your time, could only\n\nexamine me briefly and competently, just enough to see I wasn\'t in danger of\n\ndying, and then lie back to allow me to give you a blow job.\n I guess after a while we all look pretty much alike and you don\'t\n\nwant to know what propelled me that day to look at myself in the mirror\n\nwhile lines of blood ran down my arms and into the sink.\n When I painted my lips with a dab of the berry-coloured blood and\n\nsaid very quietly, in the blue and silent air, " You\'re an asshole," to my\n\nreflection in the mirror, which looked back without blinking, as though it\n\nunderstood perfectly. \n\n  I am sorry for the stories and for us, the unflinching\n\nreflections which enable you and I, as soon as we have established that we\n\nare abusers, to cut off the cold tap-water burbling down the drain and walk\n\nout into the world in search of other victims.  \n\n\n\n  Velma thinks about her hands.\n &\n\n  and   creamy.  \n She will fold them in her lap.\n She\'ll clap them lightly together at a violin recitals.\n Her nails will be tapered with an emery stick.\n On her dressing table there\'ll be different shades of polish to go\n\nwith her different clothes.',

{'text': 'Charles Cole\n\n  After graduating from university, I couldn\'t decide what to do\n\nwith the rest of my life.\n\n\nfoundland; ships could neither sail in nor out.\n I didn\'t know what to do.\n Was I eating properly?\n No.\n Was I meeting people, new friends?\n No.\n I couldn\'t think clearly enough to do any of these things.\n I had no sense of purpose.\n I knew I couldn\'t communicate with others.\n All these marvellous skills everyone else in the world had I had\n\ncompletely lost. \n\n  On the eleventh day it began to rain.\n The rain beat down on the various surfaces outside my window,\n\nsuch as the ground, the sill, even the cat I had at the time, which I would\n\nstick out the window until it got wet enough to require drying.\n Afterwards, it lay snugly in my arms, purring, which I found somewhat\n\nsatisfying.\n I kept thinking I had very little money left; I ate little; and I\n\noften stayed in my room all day without once going out into the city.\n The streets frightened me with their noise.\n The automobiles seemed angry at me \x97 when the traffic light\n\nturned red, they screeched to a halt, I tried to cross, but they inched\n\nforward menacingly as if I had no right to be there. \n\n  The next day the cat meowed for her food.\n I offered her some bread, which she ate, then I unrolled my\n\nuniversity diploma and examined it for a second.\n I tried squinting at it, blurring my vision, trying to change the "\n\nB.A." into a " BSc."\n This made me feel almost human.\n I chose a task, any task: I decided to go to the university to have\n\nmy diploma photocopied ( a highly useful first step, I reasoned).\n I dressed without incident.\n Some of the clothes \x97 a gift from my mother \x97 I had never seen\n\nbefore.\n They were new and had to be taken out of their packages, and the\n\nprice tags had to be clipped off, fifteen in all, which I arranged\n\nnumerically as I meticulously rehearsed what I was going to say to the person\n\nat the photocopy service: \n\n  " Hello.\n How are you?"\n ( To which the woman behind the counter at the photocopy service did\n\nnot respond.) \n\n \n\n  When I said this, the young woman took my diploma, unrolled it,\n\nand read it from beginning to end.\n A slight smile played upon her lips, threatening to break out at\n\nany moment.\n In fact, I could see she wanted to laugh.\n And now she peered intently at my face and particularly my hair,\n\nwhich was sandy blond and straight ( but not wispy). \n\n \n\n  " I don\'t know," I said.\n\n\n  The young woman looked back at me without saying anything.\n I smiled encouragingly.\n I imagined I heard the clock on the wall behind her tick, which was\n\nimpossible over the sound of the machines. \n\n  " You\'re sending it out with your résumé, I take\n\nit?" she asked. \n\n  Again, I couldn\'t answer her.\n I had never thought of sending out my résumé.\n I would have to think about it.\n Five seconds, ten seconds ticked by on the clock\'s face.\n Not only could I hear it, I thought I saw a cuckoo bird break through\n\nthe clock\'s face to announce her opinion of me. \n\n  " If you want to work here in the library," the young woman said, "\n\nthere\'s probably something here for you.\n\n\n  She then stepped out from behind the counter and opened a door.\n\n\n  " Go right down there and to your right," she said, pointing.\n Oh, there she is.\n Mrs O\'Brian!\n\n\n  A woman just coming out of her office turned towards us.\n\n\n \n\n  In those days, libraries were desperate for people, and Mrs\n\nO\'Brian stopped whatever it was she was doing to see me.\n I didn\'t even get a chance to sit down, or talk to her about what I\n\nwanted to do.\n She unrolled my diploma, asked me a few questions about my major, and\n\nthat was it. \n\n  " There are a number of vacant positions," she said, " but I have\n\na hunch you\'ll like the Religious Studies Library.\n If you want it, I\'ll send you over right now.\n It\'s in the old Redpath mansion.\n You know it?\n I\'m sure you\'ll feel quite at home there."\n\n\n \n\n  Never had I been so powerfully carried along by events.\n Every word spoken to me had been warm, every facial expression\n\nfriendly.\n Only someone immune, a monster, could remain indifferent.\n I almost believed my stars had somehow become aligned in the corridor\n\nI had just left joining the photocopy service and the personnel office.\n And I was now walking along campus paths I had never really felt I\n\nhad a right to use.\n I knew the Religious Studies Library and the old Redpath mansion that\n\nhoused it.\n I heard other students refer to it as a German " pile," perhaps\n\nbecause the bricks used to construct its walls had become almost black over\n\nthe years, from pollution, and it had none of the gaily painted gables and\n\nlattice that buildings built in the Victorian style had, nothing to offset\n\nthe gloom and sobriety.\n The head librarian, Miss Henchey, was waiting for me outside on\n\nthe front steps. \n\n  " In case you missed us," she said shaking my hand warmly.\n " I\'m Miss Henchey &dotted-line; but I suppose you already know that.\n\n\n \n\n  Once inside, I was struck, not by the physical sensation of\n\nsmelling, but by how much the smell of an object, a room, is shaped by the\n\nmental state we are in, for before, when I had entered this mansion as a\n\nstudent, the old books lining the walls of the corridor smelled dank and\n\nmouldy, whereas they now smelled sweet.\n We entered a room that must once have been a kitchen, then another,\n\nsmaller room that had Miss Henchey\'s name on the door. \n\n  " Sit down," she said indicating a chair covered in cracked\n\nleather that I found to be perfectly comfortable.\n Suddenly, Miss Henchey\'s smile vanished; she looked nervous,\n\neven frightened. \n\n  " Stuffy?\n You don\'t find this office stuffy, do you?\n Never mind &dotted-line; ."\n Standing up, she walked over to the window and flung it wide open,\n\nthen she sat down again.\n " Let in some fresh air, huh.\n You look thin, Mr Saks; we\'ll have to fatten you up.\n And you look pale; we have a sunny courtyard where you should walk\n\nduring your lunch hour." \n\n  Miss Henchey went on to what I would be required to do: shelving\n\nbooks, serving students at the desk, and answering simple reference ques <l>\n\ntions.\n She briefly explained what a library was: " There is an archival func\n\n<l> tion, of course, where we must preserve our body of knowledge, our\n\nculture, from the infidels.\n That\'s easy: we just watch everybody like a hawk, pouncing on anyone\n\nwho tries to steal from us.\n Our second function is more difficult; that is, we provide " routes"\n\nfor people to get at the information contained in our books and journal\n\narticles.\n How do we do this?\n You know what browsing is, don\'t you?\n That\'s when you don\'t know what you want, but you know it when you\n\nsee it.\n We try to systematize this process, take as much of the chance,\n\nthe intuition out as we possibly can.\n Again, people must trust the library to classify, to group the books\n\nproperly.\n ! " \x97 and with that, she\n\nbrought her hand down on the desk with a crashing thud. \n\n  My gaze shifted from her hand up to her eyes, which were pale\n\ngrey, behind heavy-framed glasses.\n I was often to see her take these glasses off, and put them in their\n\ncase, but only to put her other ones on, her glasses for reading.\n In those few seconds between taking off and putting on, I would look\n\ncarefully at her uncovered eyes, to see if they could function on their own \x97\n\ndid they have that sleepy, half-dazed look? \x97 and I concluded they did.\n And when Miss Henchey led me out of her office, to introduce me to\n\nthe other members of the library staff, I took a good look at her skirt and\n\nblouse \x97 did they crackle when she moved?\n I concluded they did not, that Miss Henchey had very little energy,\n\nwas sickly and slow-moving. \n\n  The library was composed of three sections: the work area behind\n\na long counter where the students came to sign out books; a large, open area\n\nfilled with tables for studying; and the stacks where the books and journals\n\nwere shelved according to subject.\n Of these three areas, I knew at once I preferred the solitude of the\n\nstacks.\n I like the peculiar smell produced when many books are placed\n\ntogether side by side, particularly when many of them are old and full of\n\nmould.\n My other duties, serving students at the front desk, for example, I\n\naccomplished as quickly as possible so that I could return to the\n\nstacks.\n Miss Henchey never complained, though she always said publicly that\n\nthe service component of our duties was the most vital.\n I realized she didn\'t believe it and that she was most at peace when\n\nMiss Minsky and myself stayed in the stacks as long as possible, making\n\nsure the books were in their proper sequence. \n\n  As it was nearly summer, Miss Henchey went around personally\n\neach morning flinging open all the windows, then she would retreat to her\n\noffice to rest.\n These windows were large, with ample inside encasements for one to\n\nstretch out one\'s legs, lean back, read, or even nap \x97 all of this behind the\n\nprotective wall of a thick, velvet curtain.\n Some of these windows overlooked a seldom used courtyard.\n The shrubs and small trees planted around its perimeter had never\n\nbeen pruned.\n Very little light got through anymore, yet time and time again,\n\nwhenever Miss Henchey found one of the curtains had been left open, she would\n\nwarn us about ultraviolet rays.\n Behind these curtained walls, no one disturbed me.\n I could read or do nothing at all except listen to the insects\n\nbuzzing among the leaves, each second bringing them closer and closer to\n\ndeath\'s door.\n Occasionally, I would simply grab one in my hand, squishing it to\n\ndeath to end its boredom.\n I tried different windows, but then I settled on just one \x97 one that\n\nafforded the possibility of escape \x97 and I was much more relaxed in my\n\ndeception. \n\n  In December, with money coming in on a regular basis, I felt\n\nconfident enough to buy a bed you could fold away during the day and forget\n\nabout.\n I would get up in the morning at eight o\'clock sharp and fold away\n\nthe bed immediately.\n Then I would prepare my coffee and open a tin of food for my cat (\n\nwho, for some reason, never ate until I had left for work).\n This went on for about a month.\n Then, after Christmas, I began to get out of the bed a few minutes\n\nlate \x96 I would throw the bed into its daytime position inside the couch, feed\n\nthe cat in a less grand style ( that is, leaving the food in the tin), then\n\nrush to work.\n The later I got up, the more I had to hurry to get everything done\n\nand arrive at work at nine o\'clock sharp.\n Something had to give.\n I decided to compromise with myself.\n I would leave bed as soon as the alarm went off, but I would set it\n\nso that I arrived at work one or two minutes late.\n\n\n\n I wanted to be sure I could be late and still retain my job.\n The first day I tried it, I arrived only thirty seconds, forty-five\n\nseconds late.\n And I went straight to Miss Henchy to tell her I was sorry I was\n\nlate.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '8dc9e879-124a-4aae-9263-85b31db2bea9', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.931789+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9894510507583618, 'non_english_score': 0.010548949241638184}
{'text': 'Tom Wayman\n\n  I have arranged to meet my friend Ian for breakfast one May\n\nmorning before he leaves for work.\n We\'re both teachers.\n Ian is employed to torture the young at a suburban high school; his\n\nsubject is history.\n I labor at the coal face in English at a community college.\n Thus, unlike Ian, I have already begun my summer break.\n I drive over to Ian\'s duplex, park, and am just getting out of my\n\ntruck when he briskly descends his porch stairs with his briefcase. \n\n  He stashes his coat and briefcase in his sports car.\n " Where do you want to eat, Dennis?" he asks.\n " Any place you like," I reply.\n\n\n \n\ngests.\n\n\n  I shrug.\n I have collected Ian for breakfast a few times before but nowhere we\n\nate made any particular impression.\n " Let\'s go," I say.\n\n\n  We decide to take my truck.\n We talk about real estate as we roll down to the corner and then\n\nsouth along Nanaimo.\n Ian is planning to buy a condo later this summer with his\n\ngirlfriend Susan, so we yak about what a step it is to actually move in with\n\nsomebody again after a divorce.\n I kid him about giving up his revitalized bachelor status and\n\nabout how I intend to hang onto mine.\n We exchange views about the latest peak in Vancouver\'s housing\n\nmarket, which neighborhoods remain affordable, and what district might be\n\nbest as a compromise between where he and Susan each work. \n\n  " There\'s the restaurant," Ian says suddenly.\n He points to an awning in the next block.\n The awning must display the name of the cafe on the side toward the\n\nstreet; all I can read on the edge of the awning facing us is Family Dining\n\nLicensed Premises. \n\n  Before we reach the restaurant, an empty parking spot appears.\n I pull over and we get out and stride along the sidewalk.\n In moments we are at the cafe.\n I open the glass door, but Ian hangs back.\n He looks around, acting puzzled.\n\n\n \n\n  I let the door close.\n On the glass is only a sticker announcing membership in the Better\n\nBusiness Bureau, a couple of years out of date, and a decal from last year\n\ntestifying to participation in the city\'s Chamber of Commerce. \n\n  " This is probably the place," Ian decides, a little hesitantly.\n " Are we going in, then?" I double-check.\n " Yes."\n He follows me inside.\n\n\n  Please seat yourself requests a sign on a stand.\n Ian and I slip into a booth and sit across from each other.\n The restaurant is almost empty.\n At the far end of the room, a couple of men in bill caps hunch over\n\nplates of food at one of a row of tables in front of large windows that look\n\nout on Nanaimo Street.\n We are in a row of booths located further inside.\n The rest of the seating is more tables: in the dim interior, a cop,\n\nhis portable radio in front of him, is seated alone; at another table a man\n\nand a woman study menus. \n\n  Nothing about the place seems in any way memorable.\n In our booth, the arborite table supports the usual bowl of\n\nneatly-stacked small plastic cream containers.\n A rectangular open box is stuffed with packets of white sugar, brown\n\nsugar, and sugar substitute.\n The standard shiny chrome dispenser holds tissue-thin serviettes.\n Two groups of knife, fork and spoon are aligned along each side of\n\nthe table facing the booth\'s seats.\n And an overturned coffee cup rests on a saucer beside each assemblage\n\nof cutlery. \n\n  A young guy walks in and sits down at a window table near us.\n His back is to me.\n He takes off his jacket and drapes it over his chair, unfolds a\n\nnewspaper and starts to read.\n\n\n  " You boys want coffees?\n Menus?"\n Her face is gaunt.\n Whenever she responds to our infrequent attempts at pleasantries, an\n\nartificial smile creases the area between her nose and chin for an\n\ninstant.\n\n\n  " You bet," I announce enthusiastically.\n " I need a coffee."\n " Decaf for me," Ian says.\n\n\n  " Sure," the waitress replies, efficiently gathering up the sur\n\n<l> plus utensils from our table.\n She gazes in the direction of what I assume is the kitchen.\n " I\'ll have to make a pot of decaf," she says absently.\n\n\n \n\n  " No trouble," the already-withdrawing waitress replies.\n I observe her stop, hands full, to speak to the newcomer reading the\n\npaper. \n\n  Ian and I turn our coffee cups right side up.\n A silence follows.\n After a minute, Ian asks me how I resolved a recent disagreement with\n\nmy department chairman about course assignments for next year.\n While I am chattering away I notice the waitress approaching from the\n\nback of the room, a coffee pot in hand. \n\n  She fills the cup of the man with the newspaper, then moves to\n\nstand by our table.\n She pours the lightly-steaming coffee into my cup first, then swings\n\nthe pot toward Ian\'s side of the booth.\n\n\n  " I wanted decaf," Ian reminds her.\n " That\'s right," the waitress agrees.\n " Sorry.\n\n\n  " And we wanted to see menus?" I say, lifting my voice as though\n\nthe statement is a question, in order to take the edge off her mistake. \n\n  " Oh, yeah.\n Jeez," she responds.\n\n\n \n\nfee and swirl the liquid around with a spoon.\n I lift the cup to my mouth and swallow.\n The hot fluid flows down my throat, and I simultaneously experience a\n\nrush of well-being sweep outward through my chest and down my arms and legs.\n\n\n\n  " I\'m probably addicted," I announce.\n\n\n  Ian is staring fixedly in the direction the waitress went.\n He rotates to face me.\n " Dennis, I can\'t believe they wouldn\'t have a pot of decaf already\n\nbrewed."\n There is a tone of urgency in his voice.\n " Maybe this place is too cheap to get the decaf going first thing.\n They wait until somebody like me comes along and asks for it.\n\n\n  Now I\'m tense.\n " More likely they realize you decaf drinkers are particular," I\n\nsoothe.\n " They want to make sure the decaf is fresh for you."\n I\'ve known Ian since university; as a consumer, he can get pretty\n\nexcited if he\'s crossed.\n Last winter his bank, for the second month in a row, took his\n\nmortgage payment out of his current account instead of his savings account,\n\nand then sent him a statement that there were insufficient funds\n\navailable.\n Ian telephoned the bank in a rage.\n " Let me speak to somebody there with a brain!" he had shrieked into\n\nthe receiver. \n\n  At the cafe there is no sign of either his decaf coffee or our\n\nmenus.\n I try to conceive of something to divert him.\n I like Ian, but his temper unnerves me.\n Driving with him through city or freeway traffic also reveals a deep\n\nreservoir of barely-suppressed fury.\n People who drive too slow or too fast, or who cut us off changing\n\nlanes, all are potential targets of a denunciation by Ian.\n He told me once about driving to work and having a guy in another\n\nsports car suddenly pull out in front of him, forcing him to stand on the\n\nbrakes to avoid an accident.\n Ian said he followed the guy in a violent rage for block after\n\nblock, blaring his horn and continually and emphatically giving the guy the\n\nfinger through the front windshield.\n\n\ngressor when a stoplight changed and the other car gunned through the amber.\n But Ian was aware of the guy ahead of him in traffic all the way to\n\nschool.\n teachers\'\n\n parking lot.\n The driver turned out to be a colleague Ian had not recognized.\n Ian said he felt shamefaced, although the other teacher did not seem\n\nto bear any grudge.\n " I guess I went a little overboard, eh?" Ian had concluded,\n\nlaughing in an embarrassed way, when he related the incident to me. \n\n  I decide to ask Ian a large open-ended question, a technique I\n\npicked up long ago when I had a summer job as a reporter on a local newspaper\n\nwhile I was at university.\n " What would you say was the highlight of this term so far for\n\nyou?" I propose.\n Yet even as Ian begins to recount an episode involving his intricate\n\nrevenge on an especially undisciplined student, I observe he is fidgeting\n\nwith his watch and glancing around the room in an attempt to spot the\n\nwaitress. \n\n  Once Ian reaches the climax of his story, and then finishes it,\n\nsilence settles between us again.\n A moment later, I am relieved to see the waitress proceeding toward\n\nus with a couple of menus in one hand and a coffee pot in the other.\n She pauses at the table of the newspaper reader to top up his\n\ncoffee, then places the menus on our table while refilling my cup. \n\n  " You didn\'t want coffee, right?" she confirms to Ian.\n Before Ian can answer, I intercede to prevent any trouble.\n " My friend asked for decaf.\n\n\n  " Yeah," the waitress says, " that\'s right.\n Slipped my mind.\n I\'ll go do it right now."\n\n\n  " What\'s wrong with this place?" Ian states vehemently.\n His indignation is palpable.\n " We\'ve been here fifteen minutes already and I haven\'t even got a\n\ncup of coffee.\n\n\n \n\ning mine.\n " That way we can order as soon as she brings your coffee.\n\n\n  " There\'s hardly anybody in here besides us," Ian explodes.\n\n\n  " Let\'s decide what we want," I say.\n " We don\'t know what goes on in the kitchen.\n Maybe she\'s under a lot of pressure.\n Perhaps they\'ve given her extra responsibilities back there."\n\n\n  " I\'m going to order the mushroom omelette," I proclaim.\n\n\n \n\nters, folding his menu.\n\n\n  " At least the service can\'t get any worse," I attempt to joke\n\nwith him.\n\n\n  Ian looks blank.\n " The truth is," he says after a pause, " I can\'t remember.\n It must have been okay, though, or I\'d have stricken the place right\n\noff my list.\n If this was the place.\n Didn\'t you eat here with me once?\n\n\n  I have no recollection of ever having been in this cafe, and\n\ntell Ian so.\n He protests mildly, insisting that we had eaten here together.\n\n\n  Knowing that Ian enjoys both eating and cooking good food, I\n\nnudge the conversation towards learning about any interesting restaurants he\n\nand Susan might have discovered lately.\n While he describes a new Italian bistro they found on Denman Street,\n\nthe waitress emerges from behind the kitchen doors with a plate of food and a\n\nbottle of ketchup.\n She settles these in front of the man near us, who folds his\n\nnewspaper and places it to one side of his meal.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'ddf0e642-06d8-4200-9682-d278d4c3e18f', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.933004+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9823057651519775, 'non_english_score': 0.01769423484802246}

{'text': 'REBECCA RAGLON\n\n  AFTER NINE MONTHS of no smoking, no drinking, and no medication\n\nstronger than vitamins, not even aspirin; after nine months of weighing and\n\nmeasuring and testing, of charts, checkups, and ultrasound; after nine months\n\nof this routine, it\'s easy to forget that babies really do come from\n\ncabbages, or from hollow logs, or from behind storkstones.\n It\'s easy to forget that for centuries they\'ve been pulled out of\n\nwells, or have been found floating down rivers in little reed baskets, or\n\nswaying in the branches of blossoming fruit trees.\n Babies have even been suckled by wolves, fed by eagles, and teased by\n\nthe wood-folk when they\'ve been bad.\n In the flurry of buying bright plastic mobiles and playpens, and of\n\nscraping and saving and planning for the future, it\'s easy to forget the\n\nimportant things, like putting the babies out \x97 in the furrows of plowed\n\nfields, under the willows, or on the sand where the waves beat.\n It\'s so easy to forget what really makes babies happy and strong and\n\nwise. \n\n  All that year in graduate school I grew pregnant under the shocked\n\nand disapproving eyes of my professors.\n It was no discreet little bundle, either; I was huge.\n The baby inside me hated the morning classes and kicked and kicked\n\nand kicked as we sat solemnly around the seminar table deconstructing poems\n\nand quoting the critics.\n We talked " strategies" and " margins" and " reader-response."\n All my professors were men, two were bachelors, and that year we\n\nspent a semester on T.S. Eliot\'s  " dark embryos,"  his term\n\nfor his poems.\n Eliot muscling in on women\'s work that way seemed cheeky, and I hated\n\nthe lines  " April is the cruelest month, breeding / Lilacs out of the\n\ndead land"  more than any other in English poetry.\n What is dead land anyway, and how can dead land breed lilacs?\n\n\n  As my belly grew and I started to wear clothes with huge collars\n\nand big bows ( to draw the eye away from the belly, supposedly), I began\n\nto get the impression that many people around, professors and students alike,\n\nfelt that my condition was rather distasteful, a discredit to the department,\n\nnot quite  scholarly  .\n Scholars, like artists, should be wedded to their work and devoted to\n\nideas; above all, they should prefer books to human beings.\n On the other hand, perhaps it was all in my imagination.\n When you\'re pregnant you tend to get keyed up; it is suddenly obvious\n\nthat you are no longer in control of your life.\n The sight of poor Tony there in bed beside me every morning, for\n\nexample, never failed to make me feel ill.\n I don\'t think I ever cried more in my life, and yet I was so happy\n\nmost of the time.\n Sometimes I felt as if I was looking at the world through a\n\nmagnifying glass, everything suddenly seemed so huge and radiant. \n\n  We lived in a very old town.\n They were always digging up shards of glass and old nails, and in\n\npiles of rubble archaeologists could discern old forts, log cabins, and\n\ncemeteries.\n Nothing much had ever really happened in our town, though, so the\n\nhistoric spots were rather dull; on this spot, Lord So-and-So picked his\n\nteeth two hundred years ago, that sort of thing.\n Parts of the town were pretty, especially the part down by the lake\n\nwhere the large houses and trees were, but we lived far, far from the lake on\n\na noisy, busy road where the rent was cheap.\n Next to us lived a family of louts \x97 they liked to sit out on their\n\nporch steps and fight and smash bottles.\n Across the street were Jimmy and Hilda.\n They spent all their time peeking through their ancient yellow\n\ncurtains, keeping tabs on everyone in the neighbourhood.\n On the corner was a little store; the woman who ran it didn\'t have\n\nenough money to keep it stocked and the shelves were always empty.\n We called it " The Empty Store."\n No one wanted to shop there anyway because the place smelled like cat\n\npiss and no one had the heart to tell her. \n\n  One night in late fall when the baby was just beginning to show,\n\nwe pulled into a gas station, and as Tony jumped out to pump gas ( I was now\n\nafraid to breathe fumes, clean the cat litter, or work in front of a\n\ncomputer screen among dozens of other things), I sat and watched as a yellow\n\nand black spider wove an enormous web between the high-octane pump and the\n\npaper-towel dispenser.\n A few months earlier and I wouldn\'t have noticed the spider; I\n\nwouldn\'t have been interested.\n Now all life interested me in a painful sort of way.\n The way things grew and struggled and died seemed terrible, and at\n\nthe same time full of remarkable beauty.\n Earthworms, slugs, ants, moths, cats, dogs, bats, were all the most\n\nastonishing things.\n What was a poem compared to an earwig?\n\n\n  The spider was having difficulty with the smooth sides of the\n\ntowel dispenser, but finally anchored her net and went on with her work.\n Her web was intricate and so beautiful; the whole complex thing\n\nsupported by four fine threads.\n Then, on the other side of the gas island, an old rusty Malibu pulled\n\nup with two people inside.\n They weren\'t any particular kind of people, but under the fluorescent\n\nlights and in their old gas guzzler they looked weird, like they had landed\n\nfrom another planet.\n I watched them as they piled out of their car, afraid someone might\n\nknock the web down.\n I kept thinking of all that effort, for what?\n For what?\n What\'s wrong with us?\n As we pulled away into the dark I started to cry, and then caught my\n\n<l> self, crying over a spider and a rusted Malibu.\n Somehow it didn\'t seem absurd.\n\n\n  Sometimes I couldn\'t sleep at night and I would get up and go out\n\nand start walking through our neighbourhood.\n Normally winter is torture for me, but all that winter I was\n\nwarm and would walk around with my coat unbuttoned and without any mittens.\n When the snow came, it came in huge soft flakes, laying down bright\n\nwhite blankets over each shabby house, gently covering the garbage cans, the\n\nold cars, and the washing machines abandoned in the back yards.\n Icicles formed on the eaves, growing longer by day and shimmering in\n\nthe moonlight like the fangs of a mythical animal.\n I liked passing the lighted windows in the dark, peering through\n\nhalf-drawn curtains, catching glimpses of people\'s lives inside: an old man\n\non an old fashioned maroon plush sofa, reading a newspaper, three people\n\nsitting around a table lit by candle light, a woman watching television over\n\nthe top of her glasses and knitting, and outside in the dark, the baby and me\n\nand a million snowflakes gliding by unobserved. \n\n  In the morning I\'d thrust my feet into a pair of moccasins ( it\n\nwas getting harder and harder to put on my shoes) and go out on the back\n\nporch where the bird feeder was.\n Usually there was a little flock of sparrows and purple finches\n\nwaiting like strange fruit in the bare branches of the ash tree and they\'d\n\nstart twittering and fluttering around as I pulled on the clothes line to\n\nreel in the feeder and fill it with seeds. \n\n  On weekends Tony and I drove into the country to a park and went\n\nskiing down a winding trail, going through the scrub trees, then out across a\n\nlake, and back up into a winter woods of snow-covered pine trees.\n I was terrified I would fall, and I always did fall, again and\n\nagain, but everything was all right with drifts of snow cushioning me and\n\nTony there to help me up again.\n We stopped in a small sunny field where pieces of brown grass poked\n\nup through the snow and an old grey barn slowly slumped back into the ground.\n On bright sunny days, with the snow and blue sky sparkling, we\'d sit\n\non a log, drink rose hip tea, and watch the chickadees. \n\n  " We won\'t be able to go skiing after this year," I told Tony,\n\nbut he scoffed.\n Tony was an optimist and he said that next year he\'d ski with the\n\nbaby on his back, and the year after that he\'d get a dog and a dog sled, and\n\nthe year after that, a little pair of skis.\n I didn\'t like it when he talked like that.\n\n\n  For the first time in my life, I loved going grocery shopping.\n I loved pushing my cart through the aisles of the store, rubbing\n\nshoulders with everyone, watching the kids riding in the carts and the\n\nPortuguese women expertly prodding the produce and helping themselves to the\n\ngrapes.\n I liked piling my cart full; for once I could eat as much as I wanted\n\nand feel virtuous about it.\n I was always hungry and I liked all kinds of food.\n Good practical food like bread and pasta and peanut butter, but also\n\nall sorts of other things: cartons of yogurt, and all types of cheese,\n\nblue-veined, yellow, white, pungent, creamy and soft, and hard, cheeses\n\nspiced, herbed, and smoked, Italian Parmesan, French Brie, and English\n\nCheddar.\n There were olives, green, black, and stuffed with pimentos and\n\npickled beets, pickled onions, and Polish dills.\n I could spend hours admiring the fruits and vegetables, and the men\n\nand women who worked with them, piling them into artistic red, green, orange,\n\nand purple pyramids, and spraying them down with hoses, fretting over the\n\npeople who pawed and squeezed, looking for the best.\n I never squeezed, not much, but took a little of everything \x97\n\noranges, bananas, avocados, kale, purple cabbage, carrots, cauliflower,\n\napples and pomegranates.\n Tony, always the big eater, couldn\'t keep up with me \x97 squash,\n\ncelery, yams, parsley, eggplant, pears. \n\n  Sometimes in the middle of the night I\'d wake up sweating,\n\nafraid.\n I\'d turn the light on and start looking through the baby books.\n We had two: the " good" baby book, which seemed to be based on the\n\nassumption that everything \x97 conception, labour, birth \x97 would be all right,\n\nand the " bad" baby book, which mentioned every possible type of misfortune.\n I bounced back and forth between them, alternately believing that\n\neverything would be all right, and convinced that nothing would work\n\nout.\n More and more panic seemed to win out, but for some reason I couldn\'t\n\ntell Tony, or anyone, about my fears.\n I lived with them, endured them, wandered barefoot in the kitchen at\n\n2 a.m. to heat up milk, then plunked down in front of the television to watch "\n\nMagnum, P.I." reruns, the cat purring on what remained of my lap. \n\n  One day I took a large sheet of paper and a pencil and with the\n\nhelp of the two baby books, made a list.\n 2 undershirts\n 1 crib and mattress\n 1 playpen ( ? )\n 2 rattles\n 6 sleepers\n 2 towels\n 1 wash tub\n 1 bar baby soap\n 1 soother ( ? )\n 1 teddy bear\n crib sheets\n bumper pads\n booties\n 6 receiving blankets\n " What are receiving blankets?"\n I asked Tony as I taped the list to the refrigerator.\n " The baby book says we need six of them.\n And what about a soother?\n\n\n  In March all the snow melted, leaving behind dog droppings on\n\nbrown grass.\n People who hadn\'t been outdoors in months suddenly appeared,\n\nshuffling down the street in their bedroom slippers.\n Tony and I started going to our pre-natal classes and with a dozen\n\nother couples learned the facts of life.\n As we lay stretched out on our backs on the floor, practising our\n\nbreathing, I felt like I was in a field of watermelons \x97 I  was\n\n a watermelon \x97 and the men crouched there all looked sheepish and\n\nguilty, as if they were trying to steal something. \n\n  I started seeing the doctor once every two weeks, then once a\n\nweek.  \n My urine was tested, I was weighed, and then, flat on my back, the\n\ndoctor took her tape measure and measured my belly.\n " Looks like it will be a good-sized baby," she said.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '4c226bc3-c489-433c-afc4-5abc1eba9b0d', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.934181+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9806228876113892, 'non_english_score': 0.01937711238861084}
{'text': 'RITA WEST\n\n\n  " Mrs West, would it be fair to say that you and your husband\n\nmarch to different drummers?" \n\n  I am sitting up in bed wearing the rose-sprig flannelette night\n\n<l> gown I have borrowed from Nora.\n Mine is one of four beds in a green room on the surgical ward of the\n\nold Halifax Infirmary.\n Dr Scranton leans against the wall, one arm behind his back.\n His head is turned away from me, but I can imagine smugness puffing\n\nout his face as he addresses his five students  .\n\n  " Do you mean are my husband and I happy together?\n Sometimes," I answer.\n " But what does that have to do with this?\n I fell sick overnight.\n It\'s my body that\'s diseased, not my mind.\n\n\n  I feel my skin like a wick drawing moisture out of my body.\n The IV pole jangles harshly against the metal bed frame.\n\n\n  " It is not for you to determine what our jobs are, Mrs West.\n Diagnosis is a matter for trained professionals, as you can well\n\nappreciate.\n If you could heal yourself, you would not have chosen to come here at\n\na time when the government is closing a quarter of the beds in this hospital.\n Now perhaps you would be so good as to answer some questions for\n\nthese doctors." \n\n  There are no questions today.\n The students have poked and prodded me almost daily for the\n\nthree weeks I have been in this bed.\n They feel sorry for me and I for them, we are all embarrassed in our\n\ncommon dependency.\n\n\n  " Let\'s say goodbye for now to our little medical enigma," Dr\n\nScranton invariably smirks as he leads them out. \n\n  Scranton is what we all call him behind his\n\nback," Heather the nursing assistant from Half Island Cove confides.\n " Rages and fumes just like an old bull.\n Still he\'s the only GI specialist in Halifax, so I guess we have to\n\nbe beholden to him." \n\n  I have my own list of creditors and Dr Scranton does not rank\n\namong them.\n It is a list I review often in the overhead glare of the blue light\n\nwhich spills into the open doorway from the corridor at night.\n Like everything else in the hospital, it has an associated unpleasant\n\nsound.\n The corridor lights, invisible and inaudible during the day, by\n\nnight emit a tightly squeezed, high-pitched scream.\n Heard only by the sick and the hounds of hell.\n But I know I have to guard against this type of inner comment.\n Or in seconds my pillow will harden into abrasive rockface under my\n\nhead and I will have to pack my mouth with starched sheet. \n\n  Far better to stave off night terrors and those hounds with\n\nritual, a litany of thanks owed to the people who let me change my life.\n Like the list of people I nightly commended to God for safekeeping\n\nwhen I was a child, before I could let myself drift off to sleep.\n Such an onerous enumeration.\n If I accidentally forgot someone I loved or fell asleep before I said\n\ntheir name aloud, they would fall prey to unimaginable horrors the next day.\n Or still worse, that very night.\n All my fault.\n Only now I was the one left off a list.\n Still culpable though.\n And I could no longer remember what my old bargaining leverage\n\nhad ever been.\n\n\n  &bullet; My Cape Breton neighbour, Rita, who, worn with watching\n\nmy despair over six winters, reminded me that there would never be an ideal\n\ntime to leave, and insisted that I phone the library school in Halifax, long\n\ndistance, right then and there from her trailer at the top of a hill in the\n\nspilling rain as our two cabin-fevered three-year-olds raged around us; \n\n  &bullet; The library school prof who answered the phone that grey\n\nmid-morning, not at all nonplussed by the wavering inquiry regarding\n\nadmission a month after applications had closed, who even held out the\n\npossibility of a scholarship once I had divested myself briefly of a shining\n\nacademic history, albeit ten years past; \n\n  &bullet; The landlady who chose me over 16 other would-be tenants\n\nin a city where three-quarters of the " for rent" ads dictated " adults only"\n\nbecause  " the little fellow looked so dear asleep in the back seat of\n\nthe car"  when we came to look at the flat; \n\n  &bullet; My husband\'s mother who flew in to the rescue from\n\nCalifornia the first week of October and stayed through till Christmas, when\n\nI phoned her in desperation after a month with a child repeatedly home sick\n\nfrom day care, and no agency willing to send a sitter because I had no\n\ntelevision set; \n\n  &bullet; Dear Nora in the upstairs flat, who, after I had ripped\n\noff my nightshirt and thrown myself face down on the cool linoleum floor,\n\ncrazy with the itch and sting of red welts which had puffed up my whole body\n\nafter weeks of diarrhea, wrapped me in a wet sheet and rocked me in her arms\n\nuntil I settled, then told me gently it was time to let it all go; phoned my\n\nhusband in Cape Breton to come and take my child, and drove me to the\n\nEmergency at the Halifax Infirmary. \n\n  In chronological order, then, against the hissing blue lights,\n\nagainst the approaching crepe soles smacking the floor in an exaggerated\n\nkiss, against the offstage screaming of strangers, against the assault of the\n\nnight nurse\'s knee as she nudges the IV pole into the chrome bed rail, again,\n\nagainst the unabashed puncturing of needles, the shameless probing of\n\nthermometers, against the sanctioned siphoning of blood and urine,\n\nagainst the illicit seepage of bodily fluids. \n\n  For dear life I hang on to this chronology, I insist on it.\n I have come to realize it is a convention universally observed among\n\npatients.\n Within moments of settling into bed or coming out of anaesthetic we\n\nhave exchanged life histories: who we were before we came, what drama\n\ndelivered us to hospital, the prophecies of our guardian doctors, the\n\nprojected date of return into our interrupted but waiting lives.\n It is important to name days, fix dates.\n Thus do you establish your place in the pecking order, the living\n\nover the dead. \n\n  This was made clear to me early by Mary MacEachern.\n The wife of a Canadian Tire manager from Antigonish, she had been\n\nreferred to Halifax for an assessment.\n Fifteen years ago she had lost her leg to poor circulation, and now\n\nher other leg was threatened.\n Even at worst, she told me, she would be on her way home in three to\n\nfour weeks.\n A handsome, bitter woman without children, she quickly determined\n\nthat my diagnosis was unclear, my treatment, to date, ineffectual, my date of\n\nrelease not even guessed at.\n This made her pitiless.\n She laughed uproariously every time I leapt from bed and bolted\n\nacross the floor to the shared bathroom, dragging an unwilling\n\n<IV pole behind me.  \n\n  " I\'ll just bet there were times you never made it to the\n\nbathroom in time,    eh   , say in a mall somewhere\n\nor on a bus across town?" \n\n  Which was exactly the question Dr Scranton had asked me at the\n\ninitial examination, in more professionally acceptable language, of course.\n Several times a day Mary MacEachern would ask me to get her pop or\n\nchips or a paper from the vending machine at the end of the hall, I was\n\nconvinced, just so she could laugh uncontrollably as I set out accompanied by\n\nthe IV pole.\n I kept her amused, I would soon be on my way to a new job in Ottawa,\n\nat least both my legs were in good working order, I repeated to myself\n\nseveral times a day. \n\n  But that was shortly after I arrived.\n Just after newlywed Estelle Macmillan was discharged following an\n\nemergency appendectomy.\n A nurse appeared to accompany her downstairs.\n " But when can my husband and me, well, I\'ll be coming home, you\n\nknow, after five days and &dotted-line; "\n She was addressing the floor and I could see her scalp flushed red\n\nunder the pale hair. \n\n  " Oh, you mean, when can you and your husband resume normal\n\nsexual relations?" the nurse articulated unmistakably as she led her down the\n\ncorridor.\n Just before Mrs Howe arrived.\n\n\n  Is this when I begin to search outside the window?\n When the hospital days finally blur into a predictable monotony?\n\n\nchecks, tepid sponge baths, trays for those who can eat.\n Heather assigns me the task of documenting my body\'s failings \x97 " you\n\ncan write as good as I can" \x97 as she hands me a clipboard.\n And, of course, the waiting: for tests, for test results, for\n\nvisitors, for doctor\'s rounds; waiting for medication, waiting for the pain\n\nto stop, waiting for the body\'s own sweet time. \n\n  My bed is nearest the window and there, on the other side of the\n\nglass, all legitimate life happens.\n I can see the parade as it rolls along the street.\n Women chat as they walk, young men slam car doors and rev up engines,\n\nmothers drag toddlers and lug groceries, kids yell, dogs bark, cats lounge,\n\nold men shuffle, kites tug at their ribbons.\n By chance or mischance I have fallen off the face of the earth.\n This is the most neutral way I have of describing it to myself.\n\n\n  I look down onto a flat asphalt roof.\n In the August sun it is adorned with several webbed aluminum chairs,\n\na faded canvas cot, a striped towel, a pink chenille bedspread, and a cable\n\nspool on its side, with glasses, beer cans, and a pair of sunglasses on a\n\nstrap.\n There, I have described it as a theatre set I know intimately, right\n\ndown to the glass ashtray ( emptied yesterday) holding down one of the\n\ncorners of the bedspread, Between 3:30 and 4:00 p.m.\n I will people it with young women, two or three of them, and their\n\nfriends and boyfriends, all healthy and sound of limb.\n I am longing for them to appear, just as I am yearning for the\n\narrival of someone who loves me, someone who will rescue me.\n\n\n  Mrs Violet Ladouceur has been here before us all.\n Her separate long feet propped on three white cushions, as if for\n\npresentation, were what I first saw when I was taken to my bed.\n They might have been the marble feet of saints and archbishops lying\n\nin state in the cathedrals of my childhood, such was Mrs Ladouceur\'s posture.\n Instead her feet were swollen and bruised, blotched purple and blue,\n\nsuch an arresting sight that the body attached to them was almost\n\ninconsequential, a thin, pale, ghostly old woman. \n\n  The nurses strapped her into a chair for feeding, forcing in\n\nmouthful after mouthful without waiting for her to swallow.\n They scolded her for forgetting to call for the bedpan, but I had\n\nseen her ringing, and waiting and waiting.\n She showed no interest in life around her and spent most of the day\n\neyes open to the ceiling.\n\n\n  " Mrs Ladouceur," I approached her on my second night in resi\n\n<l> dence, " I\'m sorry to be disturbing your sleep.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  " No," she said.\n " I\'ll never go home again.\n\n\n  " No, you\'re not.\n\n\n  " They\'re playing me for a fool.\n\n\n \n\n  " Oh, yes, I have one son, Douglas.\n Do you know, when he was a baby, he won a contest for the most\n\nbeautiful baby in Canada.\n It was during the War."\n My husband was in the Forces overseas.\n They had a photo of Douglas in a sailor suit that flashed on the\n\nscreen before the movie started in the theatre. \n Such a pretty baby.\n Red curls all over his head, blue eyes and chubby cheeks.\n - that\'s what it\n\nsaid under his picture on the screen.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'f97fde7c-d9ac-4d95-aa63-8fca2ff3d301', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.936244+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9784570336341858, 'non_english_score': 0.02154296636581421}
{'text': 'Frances Itani\n\n  Pauline was startled by the sudden memory.\n Ich habe meine\n\nSchl&uuml;ssel im Zimmer liegen gelassen.  "\n This was hopeful; Pauline\'s first dream in German.\n The evening re-runs on the ten-inch black-and-white were invading, but\n\nthey were invading dubbed. \n\n  Pauline put her own front door key on the ring, gathered up the\n\ngarbage, and called for Maggie.\n Maggie had been learning about Japan during the past week at school\n\nand had borrowed Pauline\'s kimono to practise her geisha kick.\n Since breakfast she\'d been doing a high-speed shuffle around the\n\ndining room circuit, her right foot making a side-stepping circle, followed\n\nby a quick below-the-knee thrust under the cloth.\n The extra folds of kimono - a foot longer than Maggie - were even\n\nstraightening out behind.\n Becker hadn\'t\n\nbeen on her mind. \n\n  Becker had been\n\narriving with food when she came to clean on Fridays.\n Not only had she been bringing food, she\'d begun to ask for food.\n Last week she\'d brought windfalls, a paper shopping bag of them bump\n\n<l> ing against the front fender of her bike.\n They\'d been in her storeroom most of the winter and were shrivelled,\n\nalmost dried.\n The week before that, a torte - Maggie called it a pie ( Fraud\n\nBecker\'s solid body shaking with laughter at the abruptness of the word)\n\n- and before that, six brown eggs, the feathers of her dark hens still stuck\n\nto the splotchy shells. \n\n  " Butter," she\'d said, the first time, to Pauline.\n "\n She\'d even opened her change purse, taken out two mark seventy, and\n\nsnapped it shut again.\n She offered the coins with a quick glance into Pauline\'s face.\n " she said.\n "\n And yes, Pauline understood.\n had been at her bedside table\n\nfor six months now, and anyway, who wouldn\'t have understood the word "\n\n" butter " ."\n It was just that trading or even selling goods from the commissary\n\nwas - " verboten."\n And she\'d been warned by Richard\'s host family when she arrived.\n Once the villagers find out you have a NATO connection, she\'d\n\nbeen told, look out.\n\n\n  But it didn\'t seem like that to Pauline who was the one, after\n\nall, who had to look directly into  Frau  Becker\'s face,\n\nthe one who had to read what was behind the eyes.\n Becker had\n\nreturned the coins to her purse.\n But before she\'d reached for her mop and chamois, she\'d held three\n\nfingers up to Pauline, her order firmly placed, "  Drei pfund\n\nbutter, bitte.  " \n\n  The following Friday, three packages of butter were tucked into\n\nthe bicycle bag and the order given for the next week, "  Schinken\n\n ."\n Becker seemed to know that ham in the\n\ncommissary that week was half the price of ham in the village store, though\n\nPauline could not even think about how she got this information.\n Becker\n\ndid not go to the city.\n She did not speak one word of English - except to say to Maggie, "\n\n   bye bye   , " as she left each Friday at\n\nfour.\n The rest of the time, she muttered through her work as if telling\n\nherself stories.\n Stories which Pauline could not or was not to know.\n And complicated explanations, such as the reasons why commissary\n\npurchases were " verboten," Pauline could not struggle through.\n Es tut mir leid.\n , " she could say, as her book had\n\ntaught her.\n " I\'m sorry.\n I do not understand."\n Becker\'s head, with the grey-blond bun\n\npinned tightly behind, gave the nod now, each week when she placed her order:\n\nyou understand. \n\n  Pauline stood for a moment by the radio.\n Maggie had the dial set on the short wave, her way of satisfying her\n\nlonging for her own language.\n Pauline turned the knob, just catching a German voice speaking\n\nEnglish - a woman\'s voice: "    Ninety-five \n\n    percent   said they    preferred      blondes\n\n  ! "\n And then, it was lost.\n\n\n \n\nBecker, helped Maggie with her jacket, and together they wheeled the outdoor\n\ngarbage container to the curb.\n She thought of Mae West, one hand on a hip, the other holding out her\n\nkitchen and bathroom bags to the garbage collector: "  Sie haben\n\nmeinen M&uuml;ll vergessen.  " \n\n  Their skates were in the back of the car.\n The rink was on the edge of the city, a twenty-minute drive.\n An indoor rink, and a good thing, too, as the air seemed unsettled\n\ntoday.\n Pauline was becoming used to the chill, the snowless winter, the blue\n\nlight.\n Already - and it was only February - the farmers were burning off the\n\nfeathery growth of last year\'s asparagus.\n\n\nhaps, holding patterns of dust over long mounds in the fields.\n Or a storm, unseen, but about to move down into the valley in a\n\nhorizontal black line. \n\n  Grades three and four from the International School would be\n\nskating; Pauline was a parent-helper.\n The school would be closed in the afternoon, so she\'d bring Maggie\n\nback with her and stop at the commissary on the way home.\n , this week.\n Three half-kilo packages.\n Never so much asked for that Pauline could protest, not really.\n Frau\n\n Becker\'s tiny farm bulging with North American staples that\n\nPauline herself was providing.\n A thought flashed through her mind, not for the first time.\n Becker was selling these items\n\nto the villagers?  \n\n  She bit hard on her bottom lip.\n This was paranoia.\n For those few things.\n Richard, though - she had not told Richard.\n Wasn\'t he part of the administration that kept tight control over\n\nthis very activity?\n In any case, it was going to stop.\n She would hand over the coffee that afternoon and firmly say, "\n\n Nicht mehr.\n\n\n  Becker well paid?\n Frau\n\n Becker had requested that first day she\'d propped the old bike\n\nbeside the rose bushes and stood expressionless in the doorway, waiting\n\nto be hired?\n Hadn\'t Pauline been more than fair?\n Becker seemed to be fixed\n\non her from the windshield and Pauline had to shake her head to keep the car\n\nfrom being towed into the fast lane as she joined the lunatic speed of the\n\nautobahn.\n Becker would arrive today without\n\nfood.\n Nicht mehr.\n\n\n \n\nrived from German schools, too.\n one\n\n direction, there were, of course, skaters who darted in and around and\n\nagainst the solid oval rush that glided like a heavy murmur.\n Rock music, instructions again, more music.\n .\n in\n\nthis country.\n Blasted over loudspeakers in rinks, posted on fences at outdoor\n\npools, welded to locker doors at indoor stadiums.\n change rooms\n\n  from the wrong side ( and was chased back by custodians), she who\n\nemerged wearing boots where only bare feet were permitted, she who entered\n\nturnstiles through exits, who forgot to bring her market basket to\n\nstores that did not provide bags, who pulled out the wrong currency in\n\nlineups at the   B&auml;ckerei   , who did not\n\nknow the word   &Ouml;l   at the gas station.\n It was she who, with Maggie beside her, had walked across village\n\nfield roads with a present for their landlord\'s three-year-old baby and, when\n\nthe door was opened and they were greeted, blurted out, "  Ein gift,\n\nf&uuml;rs baby  , " not knowing until she dug out the pocket\n\ndictionary on the way home that  "  gift \n\n"  was the word for poison.\n ( " Why didn\'t the mother invite us in to see the baby?\n Why?"\n Maggie kept asking.\n " I could see its crib across the kitchen.\n You didn\'t say anything awful, did you?\n Did you?")\n\n\n  When all the laces were tied and mittens pulled onto small hands,\n\nMaggie and her Grade 3 friends entered the stream of skaters and formed a\n\nchain on the ice.\n The music was fast, and several older skaters were twisting in and\n\nout at high speeds.\n Pauline watched from the boards and stepped out just as the music was\n\nabout to change - probably the direction, too.\n This instruction was shouted out that very second, as if Pauline had\n\nthought it through the loudspeaker.\n The ribbon of skaters wavered, seemed to buckle, and executed a\n\nsurprisingly graceful about-face. \n\n  It was as she rounded the curve on her skates that, out of the\n\ncorner of her eye ( how she would go over and over this), Pauline saw the\n\ntall youth go down when a fast skater darted close to him at the far end of\n\nthe rink.\n He was bigger and taller than the hundreds of school children on the\n\nice, and when he fell Pauline noted four things ( remembering these later,\n\nmuch later): how far he had to fall because of his height; that his legs had\n\nbeen moving awkwardly; that he wasn\'t wearing a helmet ( German children did\n\nnot wear helmets at the rinks, whether they were beginners or not); that he\n\nwent over backwards, his head being the first part of him to strike the ice.\n\n\n\n  When her legs had taken her to the end of the rink she bent over\n\nthe boy, and the small group around him made way as she kneeled beside his\n\nhead.\n The music had switched to a waltz; the skaters carried on.\n But the boy - he seemed sixteen, seventeen - was convulsing\n\nviolently, his back an arc, his legs and arms spastic, saliva oozing from the\n\nside of his mouth, his head rising and falling from the ice.\n And the most terrible thing - a click, a regular clicking sound\n\ncoming from some deep deep part of him.\n The children who had bunched round, seemed poised in terror.\n Two adults circled close and went back to their skating.\n Pauline held the boy\'s head and shoulders gently in her arms until\n\nthe terrible writhing and clicking - which seemed to go on for minutes - was\n\nover. \n\n  , a stretcher, an\n\nambulance!" \n\n  She was shouting.\n If he had been with friends, they had disappeared.\n If he was with a school, no teacher arrived.\n\n\n  " No, you must not move," Pauline told him softly, knowing\n\nhe could not understand but that he would stay as he was. \n\n  A man wearing a blue windbreaker, shoes - no skates - slid over\n\nfrom the nearest gate.\n He was smoking a cigarette, looked at the boy, looked at Pauline,\n\nshook his head.\n He called out behind him and two young men brought a stretcher\n\nonto the ice.\n As Pauline kept the head and neck straight, they lifted the boy and\n\ntransported him to a sparsely equipped first aid room. \n\n  " An ambulance," Pauline said again.\n " Please, call an ambulance."\n\n\nKrankenwagen   was on the way. \n\n  And that was that.\n No one stayed.\n No friends inquired.\n Only Pauline, talking softly as the boy made confused attempts\n\nto move his arms, his legs, to raise himself from the stretcher.\n\n\n  Maggie\'s face appeared round the doorway.\n " Mom, is he all right?\n\n\n  " Oh, Maggie, I hope he\'s okay.\n He had a very bad fall.\n Can you wait for me on the benches?\n\n\n \n\ntendant understand about the convulsion.\n " It\'s important.\n A head injury.\n He fell."\n Her hands pointed to his head; she mimed the fall, the bump.\n\n\n  The boy was quickly put into the ambulance; the faces blank; no\n\none spoke English.\n\n\n  " Convulsion!"\n Pauline did not know the word.\n\n It\'s important."\n But there was no dictionary in her bag today; she\'d wanted to be\n\nfree of weight at the rink.  \n And the two attendants?\n She wasn\'t certain, from their faces, that they understood.\n She tore a piece of paper from a gauze wrapper and wrote, "\n\nConvulsion.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'eaec1987-babf-4e1d-b15a-f4e8e00eae8b', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.937660+00:00', 'english_score': 0.990291178226471, 'non_english_score': 0.009708821773529053}
{'text': 'JOCELYN SMITH\n\n\n\n  I walked across Krimsky Bridge and entered Gorky Park through a\n\ncolonnade.\n Inside the park, I no longer heard the noise of the traffic on the\n\nbridge.\n Before me lay a deserted square where, perhaps, summer concerts were\n\nheld, and on the other side of the square an avenue led away through bare\n\npoplars.\n\n\n  I met nobody on the avenue.\n It was already mid-afternoon, and dusk would soon fall.\n The air was raw, and leaves underfoot damp and skiddy.\n After a few hundred yards, the avenue opened onto a small lake, and I\n\nfollowed the path round the edge of the lake.\n A notice board beside the path advertised paddle boats for hire, but\n\nthe boats were moored to a jetty and only one drifted across the lake,\n\npedalled by two children. \n\n  A man, middle-aged, and a younger woman sat on a bench near the\n\njetty.\n Both wore black fur hats.\n The man smoked a Herzegovina Flor.\n He had pinched the hollow mouthpiece of the cigarette between his\n\nfingers.\n The woman spoke, looking not at the man but at her feet.\n She traced circles on the ground with the points of red leather\n\nboots.\n " But after I married," she said as I drew nearer, " I was more\n\nlonely than I had ever been when I lived alone.\n It was always &dotted-line;"\n She broke off as I passed and glanced up at me.\n\n\n  The children\'s boat had drifted closer, and one child laughed and\n\ncalled out to the woman, then threw a handful of pebbles into the water.\n The woman smiled and waved back.\n I walked a little further along the path.\n I wanted to photograph the reflection of the fading November light on\n\nthe lake, but the woman\'s words had upset my thoughts like a stone thrown\n\ninto water.\n I had always lived alone, and although I knew that solitude did not\n\nalways bring loneliness, I had assumed, na&iuml;vely, that marriage\n\nalways ended it.  \n\n  I looked back at the woman on the bench and wondered whether she\n\nhad expected marriage to end her own loneliness.\n Had she hidden her disappointment?\n If the two children on the boat were hers, had they added to her\n\nloneliness or had they helped her to bear it?\n Had the marriage ended?\n And the man on the bench, her impassive listener: friend? second\n\nhusband?\n\n\n  Cold had made my fingers clumsy.\n I took only one photograph of the lake.\n While I walked back through the park, I turned over and over my\n\ndiscovery that there is loneliness in Moscow and in marriage.\n\n\n\n\n\n  For an hour I had wandered through quiet streets in eastern\n\nMoscow.\n I wanted to escape from the loneliness of an empty apartment,\n\nbut by nightfall the cold had grown unbearable and now, as I walked back to\n\nthe tram stop, it pierced my coat and stung me. \n\n  The tram stop was on a street that ran past the southern end of\n\nIsmailovsky Park.\n At that hour there was little traffic, and apart from two militia\n\nmen, shoulders hunched against the cold, nobody passed me on foot.\n The park lay behind snow-covered pines and birches.\n If I turned my face into the wind blowing through the trees, my eyes\n\nwatered and the tears froze my lashes together. \n\n  I was too cold to stand still when I reached the tram stop, so I\n\npaced.\n The packed snow squeaked under my heels.\n I turned.\n Two other people now stood at the stop, just on the edge of the\n\nstreet lamp\'s dim light.\n I wondered where they had come from.\n There were no cinemas or restaurants nearby, only the park, where\n\nnobody walked at night.\n When I came closer I saw that it was a woman and a man, both in their\n\nthirties.\n The woman had clasped her arms about herself and was stamping her\n\nboots in the snow.\n The man, hands in the pockets of his long overcoat, was looking over\n\nthe woman\'s shoulder in the direction from which the tram would approach.\n He and the woman spoke quietly together without looking at each\n\nother.\n\n\nphotograph  \n\n  Several moments passed.\n The couple fell silent, and I paced again.\n The lights of the tram soon appeared.\n I hurried back to the stop.\n The couple did not move.\n The tram drew up, and I stood with one foot on the ground and one on\n\nthe step so that it could not leave.\n Still the couple did nothing.\n Suddenly, the woman bent forwards a little and raised the man\'s\n\ngloved hand to her lips.\n He smiled, a quick half-smile of pleasure, then kissed the crown of\n\nthe woman\'s white fur hat and stepped onto the tram.\n The doors clattered shut behind us.\n As the tram moved forwards from the stop, I pressed my face to the\n\nwindow.\n The woman was walking away down the street.\n So, I thought, recognizing something comforting in this sight, lovers\n\nin Moscow don\'t look back either when they leave each other. \n\n\n  This week, for the first time, Kostya was late.\n Zina drew her green parka tightly about her and sat down to wait on\n\nthe stone steps outside the entrance hall. \n\n  On Wednesday afternoons Kostya gave no lectures, and Zina saw no\n\npatients, so every week they met in Sheremetev Palace.\n Few buses travelled from the centre of Moscow to the eastern\n\noutskirts.\n They were often the only visitors in the palace.\n In the first months they had walked along avenues of lindens, or\n\nwithdrawn to coolness and shade in the summer house.\n Now they met in the entrance hall of the palace, where their voices\n\nechoed, though they always spoke quietly. \n\n  In the hall they handed in their tickets and received enormous\n\nfelt slippers to protect the parquet from their winter boots.\n They sat on a marble bench to lace up the slippers.\n Every week Zina murmured " I really ought to tie my slippers myself,"\n\nand sometimes she even reached down to do so, but Kostya always\n\ninsisted.\n This touched her, and it pleased her to see his dark head bent over\n\nher lap. \n\n  From the hall they padded through salons and bed chambers and\n\nmusic rooms, each opening into the next, until they reached the ballroom.\n After the first few weeks, the guide in the entrance hall stopped\n\neven looking up from his newspaper when they passed his chair.   \n\n  Low winter sun lit the ballroom.\n Tall mirrors and white bas-reliefs covered three walls; on the\n\nfourth, windows rose to the ceiling.\n The only furniture was a set of silkwood chairs which stood against\n\none wall, between the mirrors.\n A row of chandeliers hung along the middle of the ballroom.\n For an hour or two, Kostya and Zina sat in a window seat in the far\n\ncorner.\n They talked together with pleasure and relief of names hardly\n\nrecognized at home: Bondarev and Bunin, Glazunov and Scriabin.\n Once, Zina spoke of her former husband\'s unsettling visits to her\n\ndaughter.\n Occasionally, hesitantly, they spoke of themselves.\n But often they were silent, at ease with each other.\n During these silences Zina thought of all their Wednesdays and asked\n\nherself, " do I deserve so much pleasure?\n\n\n  There had been one unhappy afternoon.\n Towards the end of September, they had borrowed her sister\'s two-room\n\napartment for a few hours instead of coming to Sheremetev Palace.\n But the brown flock wallpaper, the smell of boiled cabbage, and the\n\nsound of a child crying next door had snuffed out Zina\'s desire.\n " I can\'t," she said simply.\n And again: " I just can\'t."\n " It doesn\'t matter," said Kostya over and over, kissing her fingers.\n " It doesn\'t matter.\n Another time.\n Another time."\n But Zina had looked away, fighting tears of frustration and\n\ndisappointment. \n\n  Why was he late today?\n With the heel of her boot, Zina chipped splinters of ice off the\n\nstep below her.\n They had so little time together.\n If he had missed the bus, he would not be here for almost two hours.\n Two hours lost.\n Perhaps he was ill.\n Or perhaps his son was ill, and his wife had stayed home from the\n\noffice.\n Even if there had been a telephone in the entrance hall, Zina could\n\nnot risk calling.\n\n\n  From the window seat she would be able to watch the avenue that\n\nled from the main gate to the palace.\n She pushed open the heavy door of the entrance hall and handed in\n\nher ticket.\n For the first time, though without pleasure, she laced up the felt\n\nslippers herself. \n\n  Today the ballroom was much colder.\n Grey sky and grey ice stretched away from the window seat.\n Daylight had begun to fade.\n\n\n  She looked away from the window.\n Around her, a dozen mirrors in giltwood frames reflected her breath.\n Far across the room, one mirror reflected the door, half closed, of\n\na small bed chamber.\n Zina thought of the brown flock wallpaper and wondered, " might we\n\ntry again? \n Would that be the right thing to do?"\n Perhaps she should ask Kostya this afternoon, before she lost her\n\nnerve.\n Yes, she would ask.\n As soon as he arrived.\n He might even agree.\n The boldness of this decision astonished her.\n She glanced round, forgetting for a moment that there was nobody in\n\nthe ballroom to see her confusion. \n\n  He was now well over an hour late.\n Zina retied the knot on one of her slippers and turned once more to\n\nthe window.\n Doubt needled her again.\n Perhaps it was better after all, she thought, to see each other only\n\nin Sheremetev Palace.\n This way, they avoided further disillusionment, or at least\n\npostponed it.\n Yet she envied women and men who were free to take chances together\n\nand risk disillusionment.\n It would be good, very good, to have that freedom with Kostya.\n The shock of discovering that she had become a man\'s other woman had\n\nbeen painful; the lack of freedom to take a chance outside with that man was\n\neven more painful. \n\n  Dusk was settling over the palace grounds.\n Zina cupped her hands round her eyes.\n A figure in a long coat now walked on the avenue, but she could not\n\ntell whether it was Kostya.\n She slid down from the window seat.\n Quickly, as quickly as the slippers allowed, she retraced her steps\n\nthrough the ballroom, the music room, the salon, to the entrance hall.\n But when she reached the door, she stopped.\n " Am I doing the right thing?" she wondered again, alarmed.\n Then she thought of the window seat in the corner, the reflection in\n\nthe far mirror, and the pleasure, the pleasure.\n She pulled open the door and stepped outside to see whether the fig\n\n<l> ure was Kostya. \n\n\n  " ,\n\nthe Russian poet Boulat Okoujava writes that when he tires of this age of sci\n\n<l> ence and light and reason, he longs for Pushkin\'s Moscow of ill-lit\n\nstreets and

I cannot bring back the past.\n But I go out into the street and there, by the gates of the Arbat, I\n\nsee a fiacre waiting and Pushkin pacing up and down. \n\n After a day spent searching for milk, I too longed for a different\n\nMoscow.\n\n\n  The Arbat was one of the most fashionable streets in Moscow when\n\nPushkin rented a flat there early in 1831.\n He lived amongst artists and writers, wealthy bohemians who dined at\n\nthe Yar and then returned to their elegant pale blue houses to drink cham <l>\n\npagne and play cards until morning.\n In letters to friends, Pushkin wrote of life on the Arbat and of his\n\napproaching marriage:\n My marriage with Natalya ( who, parenthetically, is my\n\nhundred and thirteenth love) is decided &dotted-line;.\n In a few days I shall visit you, and I shall bring the champagne\n\nwith pleasure.\n I met the New Year with the gypsies and with Tanyusha, my\n\ngenuine drunken Tatiana, who sang a song made up in the gypsy camp\n\n&dotted-line;.\n I am breaking this letter off here, so as not to pass my anguish on\n\nto you; you have enough of your own.\n\n The Arbat soon grew too expensive for Pushkin, and after six months\n\nhe and Natalya left Moscow to live in a country house near  \n\n Saint   Petersburg.  \n Six years later, Pushkin was killed in a duel with Natalya\'s lover.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'S.K. JOHANNESEN\n\n\n  Rich and beautiful people sit in a modern concert hall in a\n\nEuropean capital.\n Row upon row of white ties and medals, diamond tiaras, flattened\n\nbosoms in satin dresses.\n The people are intent on a man playing a piano.\n The pianist is old and apparently frail; his eyes are shut as though\n\nin pain or weariness, or in an excess of inwardness.\n Nevertheless, he is hitting the keys of the piano with a force that\n\nlifts him bodily from the bench. \n\n  There are other films in the stack of tin boxes kept in a cupboard\n\nto one side of the low platform: travelogues from Norway, temperance\n\nfilms, home movies of missionaries in China or Africa in which white women in\n\nround eyeglasses and stout shoes and sly native co-workers, yellow or black\n\nas the case may be, stand together or walk about in   \n\ndumb show   conversation for long minutes. \n\n  One or two of these entertainments are shown toward the close of\n\nthe meetings at the Blue Cross Mission on Seventh Avenue in Brooklyn on the\n\nfirst Thursday of every month.\n Brother Bringsrud finishes his sermon, then the caretaker of the\n\nmission, Old Tom, who lives upstairs and keeps a parrot chained to a roost,\n\nsets up a small projector in the aisle between the few rows of assorted\n\nwooden and metal folding chairs and pulls down a window blind that serves as\n\na screen. \n\n  While Old Tom is about these preparations Sister Ruth and Sister\n\nHildegard retire to a place at the rear of the platform, from which presently\n\ncome the smells of coffee percolating and of buttered rye-bread and brown\n\ngoat-milk cheese.\n At the end of the film cups and saucers and little spoons are\n\ndistributed.\n The sisters pour coffee, and cream and lump sugar and plates of\n\nopen sandwiches of goat cheese, or sliced egg and anchovy, or dark salted\n\nbeef, are passed around.\n After an interval and a refilling of the coffee cups, plates of\n\nalmond   \n\nappear, carefully sliced, thick or thin, according to how the sisters\n\nestimate it has to stretch.\n ( My brother and I imagine that the bums are only allowed the ends of\n\nthe  vinerbrod  .\n We know it is not really true, but we still say it to each other and\n\nhave a good laugh.) \n\n  There is never a very large crowd.\n The bums, all regulars, will sleep in the hall later on the cots that\n\nOld Tom brings to replace the folding chairs.\n Mostly there are the people from Ebenezer.\n Besides Brother Bringsrud, Sister Ruth and Sister Hildegard, there\n\nare Sister Doris, who plays guitar and sings, and Sister Sara, who only\n\nsings.\n Happy Hansen is always there.\n She is called this, despite a permanently lugubrious set to her\n\nmouth, because her testimony always begins  " I am so happy," \n\nafter which it is unintelligible and soon ends in confusion and sobbing.\n This makes everyone smile and loosens the testimonies.\n Then there is a woman whose name is never mentioned, who has hair on\n\nher face and looks like a cat; a small man with a twisted mouth; Kjell, who\n\nplays the trumpet and seldom speaks and is thought to be mentally disturbed;\n\nDanish Andersen, a short round man who plays the banjo-mandolin; and my\n\nfather, Ole, and my brother and me. \n\n  The history of Ebenezer is obscure because the Free Friends do\n\nnot keep membership lists.\n Such history as it had before about 1935 must be gleaned from back\n\ncopies of   Nordisk Tidende   \n\n, in which black-edged boxes from time to time announce " special" meetings\n\nin one rented hall or another above the shops on Fifth Avenue.\n In 1935 the Friends purchased a building, and Brother Tornquist\n\ninvited an American from Pennsylvania to be pastor, with his wife who played\n\nthe piano.\n They introduced services in English and American songbooks,\n\nevangelists, gospel rallies, and Sunday school, none of which is strictly\n\naccording to scripture.\n Ebenezer now has a woman preacher from Canada who has not only\n\ndoubled the scope of these activities but has added a radio ministry.\n The Friends are in a dilemma.\n They do not approve of the direction things have taken.\n Even Brother Tornquist moved to Staten Island when he saw what he had\n\ndone.\n On the other hand the Friends believe you can have only one local\n\nchurch during your life.\n Even if you move away you are still a member of the place where you\n\nwere saved, even though that place has no membership list.\n In time they will get rid of the woman preacher, through some talk\n\nstarted by Sister Hildegard.\n Ebenezer will be restored to the Friends, except that members with\n\nchildren will go to Elim, as my parents did in 1948. \n\n  Elim is bigger than Ebenezer.\n\n\nPinse venner   or Pentecostal Friends, whose rivalry with the\n\nFree Friends goes back to Norway.\n In 1941 Elim left the old movie house it occupied on Seventh Avenue,\n\njust a block from the Blue Cross Mission, and moved into a Jewish Temple on\n\nFourth Avenue.\n It is now just around the corner from Ebenezer.\n Elim keeps membership lists and has adopted, after much debate and\n\ndetermined opposition, a songbook with the notes printed. \n\n \n\n .\n It comes from Norway in a version with notes and one without notes\n\nand consists largely of translations of English and American gospel songs.\n\n\n which comes only without notes.\n The songs were all composed by the Norwegian founder of the Free\n\nFriends.\n The lyrics of these songs, of which there are hundreds, dwell heavily\n\non the dreadfulness of sin and the merits of the Blood and are set to jolly\n\nsing-song tunes that all sound more or less alike, as they would have to be\n\nsince they are never written down.\n\n  At the time of which I write my father is friendly to the people\n\nfrom Elim although he is an elder at Ebenezer.\n As an elder he prefers to keep his opinions to himself and let others\n\nlead.\n\n\n  There was, for example, the time the floor gave way during spe\n\n<l> cial meetings and a method had to be devised for jacking it up, which my\n\nfather did, applying the principle of the lever.\n This caused temporary consternation because it involved tearing up\n\nmore floorboards than some thought necessary.\n " Just\n\na hair more,"   " Another hair,"   " Back off a\n\nhair,"  from the prone brethren, eyes squinted to the floor, my\n\nfather was vindicated, even though the floor later sagged anyway. \n\n  Another time one of the lay preachers who came and went among the\n\nFree Friends was found drunk in the church kitchen by some sisters arriving\n\nearly for string-band practice.\n There was talk of excommunication.\n My father argued that according to the Bible they were not to touch\n\nthe Lord\'s anointed.\n\n\n  My father has compassion for the bums that goes back to his own\n\ndays as a sailor adrift in New York.\n When he sees a bum he thinks there but for the grace of God goes Ole.\n The bums sleep in our vestibule sometimes and wet themselves and\n\nleave smelly puddles.\n My father takes them in the morning to the White Hut to see that they\n\neat a hamburger and drink a cup of coffee.\n He won\'t give them the twenty cents because they would spend it on\n\ndrink.\n In the early days he brought them into the house and gave them clean\n\nsocks or a shirt, but my mother put a stop to that. \n\n  Ole is night porter on Wall Street at the Guaranty Trust Company\n\nwhere he earns thirty-five dollars a week.\n Without drink, thirty-five dollars a week equals safety,\n\nrespectability, happiness.\n Five dollars toward the rent, five dollars in the savings bank,\n\nfifteen dollars for the running of the household, and ten dollars left for\n\ntithes, small outings, packages for the relatives in Norway, sneakers in the\n\nsummer, a second-hand mackinaw in the winter, such occasional capital\n\nexpenditures as the cost of a used rug or sofa.\n A thousand calculations and it all fits as though by magic.\n With drink, all these things evaporate by the same inexorable\n\narithmetic.\n\n\n  My father takes my brother and me to the various missions.\n Besides the Blue Cross, there is the Carroll Street Mission in South\n\nBrooklyn, the Norwegian Salvation Army at Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street, the\n\nHospital and Prison Mission, where Elim used to be.\n He thinks it is good for the bums to see some children.\n Perhaps to see the fruits of sobriety.\n But mainly because he knows they are lonely.\n He gets us to recite for them, long after Christmas is past, the\n\npieces we learned for the Sunday school Christmas program at Ebenezer. \n\n  My father\'s peripatetic piety includes not only the missions but\n\nother churches and tabernacles, some far afield, in Elizabeth, in West New\n\nYork, on Staten Island, all of which require hours of buses and ferries and\n\nbuses again, several churches in Manhattan which are reached by subway, a\n\nplace in Park Slope where a renegade group from Elim calling themselves\n\nThe Latter Rain anoint one another apostles and prophets and speak\n\necstatically of last things. \n\n  Ole is intellectually restless.\n Not himself a learned man, or a man of prophetic calling, he has\n\nimmense respect for men who open the divine mysteries, whose speech is\n\nauthoritative, knotty, pregnant with import, full of hard sayings and\n\nprecise calculation, whose words are long trajectories of casuistry spiced\n\nwith irony and weighted with scriptural references.\n He sits, always in the rear of the hall, with a half-smile compounded\n\nof distraction and concentration, never really part of the doings about\n\nhim, the only sign of his close attendance on the matter in hand a meticulous\n\nhighlighting of the opened scripture texts, in red and blue pencils, in\n\nhis big Scofield Reference Bible. \n\n  Brother Bringsrud, whom my father comes to hear at the Blue Cross\n\nMission, is a carpenter by trade.\n He owns a roomy Plymouth car in which he hauls variously the\n\nequipment of his trade, the songbooks and pump organ for street meetings, and\n\nthe sisters who attend the Blue Cross.\n Brother Bringsrud is married to a stern and ugly woman who has the\n\nspiritual gift of discernment.\n Sister Bringsrud is usually elsewhere as a consequence, often with\n\nthe Latter Rain people in Park Slope, where she regularly discerns carnal\n\nmanifestations in the exercise of more exuberant spiritual gifts than hers,\n\nand sometimes the influence of demons. \n\n  Brother Bringsrud builds houses on Long Island when the weather\n\nis good.\n He works alone, digging foundations by hand, cutting studs by\n\nhand too, eight or ten at a time with economical and powerful strokes of a\n\nbeautifully oiled panel saw that serves also as a musical instrument.\n Brother Bringsrud keeps the saw always by him, in an oilskin case\n\nwith a zipper along the back and two handles like those on a small\n\nvalise.\n In the case, besides the precious saw, is a violin bow, a cake of\n\nrosin and a square of blue flannel cloth. \n\n  When Brother Bringsrud is about to play the saw he sits well for\n\n<l> ward on a chair, removes the cloth from the case and places it with nice\n\nadjustments over his left leg.\n Then the saw is taken up and the handle tucked under his thigh.\n Brother Bringsrud always pauses at this point to apply rosin to the\n\nbow, slowly, with prodigious care, like a woodcarver sharpening his chisels,\n\nas though in just this procedure lies the secret of his art.\n\n\nBringsrud   grasps the narrow end of the saw delicately but firmly\n\nwith the left hand, bending the blade in a long arc downward over the\n\ncloth-covered leg and at the same time re-curving the tip upward with the\n\nfingers.  \n As he plays, his right arm reaches across his body, drawing the bow\n\nup and down on the smooth edge of the saw.\n The sound is an eery, fragile, crystalline overtone, like a glass\n\nrubbed with a wet finger, a sound of pure tembre and indeterminate\n\noctave, a tone both clean and unclean.\n Pitch and volume are varied by the placement of the bow along the\n\nlength of the saw and by subtle alternations in the elevation and curvature\n\nof the blade under Brother Bringsrud\'s strong fingers.\n An intermittent trembling of the right leg produces an expressive\n\nvibrato toward the end of long-held notes.\n Brother Bringsrud strokes the notes rather as an oarsman urges his\n\nboat along.\n He leans into the pull and then subsides, the bow delicately poised\n\nabove the vibrating saw, then leans into the pull again, and again subsides,\n\nsometimes slowly, sometimes quickly.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '0b1cf0e6-55ef-42fb-bfd0-ba499bfdeec6', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.940585+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9717824459075928,

{'text': 'RICK BOWERS\n\n\n  I can still see Dad, biting on bloodied handkerchiefs, begging us\n\nboys to brush our teeth and avoid his miserable fate, urging Mom to\n\nmarry again after his death and be happy.\n His uppers had been pulled earlier that same afternoon while I\n\nstruggled with fractions in Math class, wished that I was old enough to drive\n\nand maybe take Miss Brimley out camping.\n A week before, Dad\'s lowers had been pried out of their sockets while\n\nI considered the fiery torment of Father Brebeuf in History class, wondered\n\nwhy Miss Brimley, always smiling in freshly coiffed hairdos, big blazers, and\n\ntight skirts above the knee, looked so much more beautiful than Mom.\n But looking back, I guess Miss Brimley was probably fifteen years\n\nyounger than I am now.\n Mom was probably my age.\n Thirty-nine.\n Besides, Mom had me and Jim to contend with when she wasn\'t working at\n\nthe snack bar.\n No wonder she looked used by the years, her face bitten in terseness\n\nas she rolled her eyes at my father\'s lamentations, told him to act like a\n\nman in front of his sons. \n\n  My abscessed bicuspid really pulsates up into my ear, pumping\n\nslowly with morbid significance.\n I look in the mirror and observe the swelling.\n My lower right mandible bulges out as if I were chewing a squash\n\nball.\n But I don\'t really feel involved in the discomfort.\n I feel as though I were someone else observing me.\n Dad\'s ruined mouth, by contrast, must have felt pretty immediate to\n\nhim: like an arm ripped off or an open sucking wound of the chest wall.\n His face looked crashed in.\n Furious in his distress until tired by his rigors, Dad moaned a\n\ncouple times through the night, inhaling deeply, muttering  " Jesus,\n\nJesus Christ almighty"  in his sleep.\n Miss Brimley drew our attention to sucking wounds of the chest wall\n\nin Health class once.\n She said we were to cover the site with a plastic bag or something\n\nand call an ambulance.\n I wanted so badly for her to demonstrate mouth-to-mouth artificial\n\nrespiration on me.\n Miss Brimley\'s mouth was shapely, drawn into a full cherry-ripe smile\n\nwith gorgeous red lips and white teeth.\n My lips are dry, my tongue a little shredded where I bit it under\n\nlocal anaesthetic.\n And now that the freezing is wearing off, my mouth throbs like a\n\nvoice from the steaming dark.\n The codeine seems to rob me of emotional reaction, but the pain\n\nremains. \n\n  I don\'t usually live in a great deal of pain.\n I\'m an associate professor of English, with full dental coverage, on\n\nstudy leave at 80 per cent of my salary.\n My work during sabbatical involves the cultural rehabilitation\n\nof Renaissance polymath Thomas Phaer, a physician, lawyer,  mp\n\n , and general man of letters in sixteenth-century England.\n Big deal.\n Obscure.\n Nobody\'s life depends on it.\n But I guess my sabbatical project represents a further particle\n\nof knowledge to be contributed to the study of the Humanities.\n No one else will do it if I don\'t.\n Oh, my aching head.\n Besides, I firmly believe that knowledge for its own sake is\n\nvaluable.\n Such academic faith rescues me from more immediate and intolerable\n\nconsiderations: my childishness, my  , my\n\nuncomfortable sense that life is rapidly passing me by as I twiddle my\n\nthumbs and envy the accomplishments of others.\n\n\nis  a world elsewhere of involvement and interaction, a world where\n\nsurprise can enter the heart like a pickaxe through the chest. \n\n  I observe my face in the mirror once more, bare my teeth and feel\n\na jet in my mouth.\n The teeth themselves feel as though they have been chewing on tin\n\nfoil.\n I watch my fingers explore along the whiskery ridge of my misshapen\n\njaw, wonder at the pain of toothache prior to twentieth-century dentistry.\n\n\n Breeding   of teeth," Phaer writes:  " And wh[e]n the\n\npeyne is greatte and intollerable with aposteme or inflammation of the\n\ngommes, it is good to make an oyntmente of oyle of roses with the juyce of\n\nmorelle, otherwyse called nyghtshade." \n Roses and deadly nightshade - the ancients knew best how to appease\n\npain and all its symbolism.\n They treated pain with the mercilessness of love.\n Today, we think we can counteract pain with drugs.\n I squeeze my eyes shut, and a hum of sad choirboys tunes up in the\n\nback of my head.\n Alto-tenors predominate.\n My tongue protrudes and I can see myself breathing on the\n\nmirror.\n It wearies me.\n\n\n  In grade five, Miss Brimley always smiled at me.\n A girl-woman, tall and curvaceous, she used to put her hand on my\n\nshoulder during Art class.\n " Use any colours you want, John," she said.\n " You have a flair for colours."\n The other teachers were trolls.\n\n\nwoman who didn\'t like colours all that much.\n She was always tight-lipped and angry about Dad, about the world.\n " Make you sick!" was her response to everything.\n " John, clean up that mess," she\'d say.\n " Make you sick!"\n Or, " John, why did you have to go and do that.\n Make you sick!"\n On weekends, she\'d sit back in her sofa chair, exhale cigarette smoke\n\nto the ceiling, complain to her friends: " Did you see the makeup she was\n\nwearing?\n Make you sick!\n And the colours &dotted-line; oh my!"\n Mom\'s friends all wore pants with zippered sides that never quite\n\nclosed.\n They traded magazines back and forth, magazines that advertised a lot\n\nof bras.\n The back cover of the magazines always showed a man and woman dancing\n\ncheek-to-cheek.\n\n By now, somewhere, Miss Brimley is well over 50 years of age.\n I touch my swollen face, cupping the bulge of my jaw in the palm\n\nof my hand.\n I\'ll leave off shaving until tomorrow.\n\n\n  Last night, I saw an advertisement on TV for a face cream that\n\npurported to  " reverse the aging process." \n The model - fabulously blonde, slim-nosed, slight waisted, and leggy\n\nunder a luxurious blue    terry cloth   robe\n\n- held the product up to her face for a full-frame closeup and declared:\n\n "  You  have the choice." \n This was during a baseball broadcast, for God\'s sake.\n My choices, I feel, are severely limited.\n Interviewed on a syndicated talk show, fashion writer Angela Veno\n\ncommented as follows:  " A successful model need only be a standard\n\nsize 8, five-foot-nine or over, have good skin and hair, and both front\n\nteeth." \n Her humour seems lame to me.\n I felt an ache in my jawline, reached for the channel selector,\n\nthought about more codeine.\n But then I froze as the commercial for the age-reversal cream\n\nwas repeated.\n The model looked to be the spitting image of Loreena, my teenage\n\nsweetheart.\n Was there a technical slip up?\n Was the commercial aimed at a male viewing audience?\n Dear God, was it aimed at me?\n I\'ve got to get out more.\n Either that, or lose this aching tooth.\n My head feels as though it\'s closing.\n If I thought for a moment that reversal of the aging process was\n\npossible, I would buy stock in the company.\n As an associate professor, I make enough to do so.\n I\'m fully insured, without children, on double income with my spouse,\n\nlooking at mutual funds, and spending very little on entertainment.\n\n\n  Pain is relative and subjective.\n A threshold of emotionality is involved.\n Dr Trudy Brydges, my dentist, inquired about the nature of my pain,\n\nurging me to specify whether it was a sharp, piercing, localized sensation or\n\na more generalized dull, throbbing ache.\n This confused me momentarily.\n Using the hand mirror which she provided, I pointed daintily with my\n\npinky finger at the howling tooth in question.\n She performed a percussion test, knocking against the specified tooth\n\nwith the handle of a dental instrument.\n My head exploded.\n All confusion left me.\n Jagged spikes of purple and orange shot out of my ears into the\n\nwaiting room where they overheard Paula, Dr Trudy\'s receptionist, complaining\n\nabout Greg.\n " He\'s such a baby," she said.\n My forehead ridged itself down my face.\n " Are you okay, John?" asked Trudy.\n I nodded, exhaling aromatic rocky boulders, my face rattling\n\nlike a stack of sharpened tin forks.\n A whiff of iodine wobbled in my sinuses and I felt myself crawling\n\nup the back of the chair. \n\n  During recess once, while playing sidewalk soccer, I scraped my\n\nknee off.\n It oozed orange and red and it watered down my shin.\n\n\ncrab-apples   crabapples   .\n Miss Brimley asked me " Are you okay, John?"\n Her look of concern was as beautiful as her smile.\n She smiled fully at me.\n She placed both hands on my shoulders.\n lounge, washed the grit\n\nout of my wound.\n " This iodine will sting you, John," she said.\n But I didn\'t mind so long as Miss Brimley was there, was speaking to\n\nme with sympathetic apprehension.\n In fact, I had never felt better in my life than I did right then,\n\nalone with Miss Brimley in the  lounge, gritting my teeth,\n\nplaying the brave soldier, living by her attentions.\n Miss Brimley placed a cold cloth on my forehead, told me to lean\n\nback on the couch, said that I could stay in the room as long as I liked\n\nuntil I felt better.\n I then remember sniffing a little in sweet torment as she sat with\n\nme, hugged me to her on the couch.\n She smelled like candy and flowers.\n Her body felt large and comforting and soft.\n She hummed a little, hushing me gently and assuring me that I would\n\nbe all right.\n I clung to her, didn\'t risk moving a muscle in case it might lead to\n\nrearrangement or loss of contact. \n\n  Mr Peacock, our surly principal, arrived a little later to drive\n\nme to the hospital in his car.\n His teeth were perpetually tobacco-stained and grimy.\n I never liked him.\n He jovially parted me and Miss Brimley, made light of my resistance.\n But he seemed genuinely concerned too, accompanying me to\n\noutpatients without comment.\n All I could think of, as my knee crusted over, was the special\n\nrelationship between Miss Brimley and me.\n My eyes misted in remembrance at the smooth feel of her hand in my\n\nhair and around the back of my neck.\n Nobody else in class ever received such treatment.\n My pain was pleasure so long as I could close my eyes and see her\n\nsmiling face. \n\n  The debonair Elizabethan courtier Sir Philip Sidney wrote a poem\n\nentitled  " When His Lady Had Pain In Her Face,"  and it made\n\nme reflect upon Elizabethan dentistry and the pleasing pain of love in a\n\nsonneteer\'s mind.\n Love, love, the pain of love I seek.\n Hand me the pliers.\n This, just after Dr Trudy\'s hygienist, Kayla, placed a book of\n\nGarfield cartoons on my lap.\n Concerned and well-meaning, Kayla offered, " Perhaps this will help\n\na little?"\n Her every utterance is a tentative offering, her voice rising\n\nmusically: " Hi.\n My name\'s Kayla?\n Looks like you\'re going to have &dotted-line; a root canal?"\n I feel cranky and doubtful.\n Garfield cartoons?\n I teach English Literature at the university, goddammit.\n in my\n\ncurrent painful condition ( although one or two of my more vaguely crazed\n\ncolleagues probably would), but some form of reading matter above the\n\ngrade five level would be welcome.\n When in grade five, I watched Miss Brimley\'s captivatingly fresh\n\nface and beautiful white teeth and was immune to everything else.\n\n\n  Dad confided to me once that he never felt young again after he\n\ngot his dentures.\n This was on the morning of my first communion.\n Just moments before he had confessed his atheism to me as he knotted\n\nmy necktie.\n I wondered to myself if dentures and loss of faith were somehow\n\nconnected.\n Years later, a dentist in Hamilton, Ontario, checking me over for a\n\npossible stint with CUSO  ,\n\ncomplimented me on the general condition of my teeth.\n " bad\n\nteeth, bad people." \n " Smart woman," he intoned without a trace of irony as he adjusted\n\nthe lamp above my face.\n " bad teeth,\n\npoor people,"  and felt certain that my dentist, with his red BMW and\n\ncrisp Arrow shirts, must have had some notion of the economic side of the\n\ninequation.  \n Even dental coverage proves expensive.\n A colleague of mine at the English Department once advised me, "\n\nJust think " \'orthodontist\' " and be thankful that you and\n\nBeryl don\'t have any kids."\n She added that the very word " " orthodontist" "\n\nmade her feel old.\n Bitten by her own mortality, I guess.\n That dentist back in Hamilton informed me as follows: " As we age\n\nour gumlines recede and are subject to increased sensitivity."\n ?', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'e4995bcd-927f-463c-918a-a8ff170edf00', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.941954+00:00', 'english_score':

perhaps they were criminals.\n Maybe under all that fur they had motives just like the rest of us.\n\n\n\n \n\n  The chainsaw whined angrily in my grandfather\'s hands.\n My grandmother handed me a pair of clippers that looked like they\n\ncould shear off bone. \n\n \n\nform, attached by delicate necks of stems.\n\n\n  " You should have worn you a hat," my grandmother said.\n\n\n  My grandfather watched our progress from time to time, peering\n\nover the whine of the saw.\n A perpetual noticer, my father\'s father.\n Noticing this and that, he added up each detail and weighed it\n\nagainst your character: the wasted motion in a given activity, the missed\n\ncue, a method that was not his method and therefore deemed inefficient. \n\n  They said he was a brilliant man, my grandfather who never fin\n\n<l> ished high school; tested higher than 140 IQ points in the Service. \n\n  But a brilliant man with no patience is just an impatient man;\n\nSolomon without circumspection. \n\n \n\ngin for error, no kindness for misunderstanding. \n\n  And his impatience was headed my way, the flying shrapnel of\n\nscrutiny. \n\n  My hands faltered here and there: a wrong connection while try\n\n<l> ing to hook a chain around the tree trunk.\n\n\n  These errors told him volumes about me.\n\n\n  This was my grandfather\'s court of law; we understood that \x96\n\ngrandmother, my father, and me.\n He had long since appointed himself judge and jury of the mown\n\nfield.\n\n\n  All details recorded here would be used against you immediately:\n\nthe way my grandmother pulled the truck up too far when he had told her to\n\ndrive down the hill.\n Absent-minded.\n water jug\n\n  , by the strap and not by the handle.\n\n\n  His impatience made him appear larger with each sharp command.\n " Cut the wheel.\n Cut your wheels!"\n " Look out you don\'t get that on you."\n\n\n  Then there were the flat hands that beat the air to direct you;\n\nthe exactness of the close-shaved white hair; the girth that hung around him\n\nas armor. \n\n  Even at 77, he was a man to be feared.\n But his was inadvertent cruelty, the boy who grows old and never\n\nlearns to taper his will with tenderness. \n\n  Yet somehow the pearl-like wild cherries were the culprit.\n\n\n  Once the branches were shorn off the trunk, and the trunk sawed\n\noff at the roots, the hulking tree carcass could be left in the field.\n\n\n  Next the leafy arms had to be gathered and loaded up onto the\n\nback of the pick-up. \n\n \n\n  " She works like a Turk," my grandfather would later say, half in\n\npride, half in shame. \n\n  " Wouldn\'t have hurt your daddy to try and have a boy, just one"\n\n\x96 that was his other refrain. \n\n  My father said he\'d learned most of what he knew about my\n\ngrandfather from his mother.\n , a\n\nstoryteller, a translator.\n The smoother-over of rough words, she had become my grandfather\'s\n\ntenderness, a personal attribute outside the body. \n\n  During those hot hours, the tree-moving task hurt each of us in a\n\ndistinctive way.\n My grandmother met her sorrow bent under the weight of dragged\n\nbranches; my own    rib cage   ached from the\n\ntwisting motion each time a bundle of long twigs left my arms for the\n\nbed of the blue truck.\n My grandfather glimpsed his own anguish in the shadow of the fallen\n\ntrunk. \n\n  In addition to his share of the branches, my grandfather carried\n\nmy worth along with this burden.\n How we\'d all failed him at one time or other \x96 he carried that too.\n\n\n\n  My failed attempt to attach a hook to the correct peg on the back\n\nbumper of the pick-up truck, that also made its way into his satchel of\n\nworries. \n\n \n\ncation from the city hadn\'t taken the form of common sense in the\n\ncountryside.\n To him knowledge was a transferable coupon, redeemable in all\n\nsituations. \n\n  It was plain for all to see in that pasture: my knowledge without\n\napplication; his wisdom without serenity. \n\n  When all the branches were safely piled up in the flatbed, we\n\ndrove down to a gully beyond the adjacent meadow where five-foot high bales\n\nof rolled hay stood motionless. \n\n  My grandparents were seated in the cab of the truck.\n Hands too tired, my folded arms gripped the rusted white railing of\n\nthe pick-up; the rusted railing that mimicked the skin of a heifer. \n\n \n\n  My job was to stand on the tailgate and fling the largest\n\nbranches into the gully. \n\n  " Get them out there as far as you can," my grandfather\n\ninstructed. \n\n \n\n  It was more an act of courting gravity rather than taking flight.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  The city with all its shrewdness had left me on my own at the\n\ngravel path that led to my  farm. \n\n  Virginia: it didn\'t care about me \x96 girl, daughter,\n\ngrand-daughter, first generation Yankee.\n\n\n  Me, the wild cherry tree, branches blown this way and that.\n It was the free spirit in me they wanted to shear off.\n\n\nillustration  \n\n\n H. R. PERCY\n\n\n  The thread of remembrance, ever more tenuous, leads back and back\n\nuntil I find myself in a dark closet, kicking the door and bawling with all\n\nthe power of my two-and-a-half-year-old lungs.\n\n\ntion on my neck, the scars of which I yet bear.\n But far deeper was the scar resulting from the terror of drowning in\n\nthat palpable dark.\n Whole years of my later life have left scarce a memory to be gleaned,\n\nyet I have but to close my eyes and I can feel the suffocating pressure\n\nof that antiseptic-smelling darkness and hear my own screams.\n What wickedness of mine could possibly have merited such punishment?\n Impossible, now, to imagine what I could have done to provoke the\n\nnurse into leaving me in that dread place until I screamed myself insensible.\n Of all the other traumas that must have beset me, abandoned there \x97\n\nforever, for all I knew to the contrary \x97 in that alien place of many beds\n\nand sickening smells, nothing remains.\n The nurse herself is no more than a big white bosom and a formless\n\nmask of malevolence, but she stalked me for years through the dark places and\n\ndarker dreams of childhood. \n\n  It could not have endeared me to her that I spilled the beans to\n\nmy parents when they came to visit.\n I can\'t remember doing it, but I do have a very clear sense of myself\n\nlying there steeped in self-pity, and of the dawn of indignation in my\n\nmother\'s face as she rose and turned to incite my father to vengeance: images\n\ndistilled, no doubt, from their later telling of it.\n But I do clearly recall that any comfort I may have drawn from her\n\ncompassion and his anger was supplanted by despair when it became evident\n\nthat they were going home and leaving me there. \n\n  Memories of the years immediately following decline to fall into\n\nany sequence other than that imposed by hindsight.\n Memory is more associative than sequential, so that what comes\n\nnaturally to mind in the wake of that early ordeal by darkness is the thrill\n\nof riding Hucks\'s bus, ascending the hill on the way to Eccles with a\n\ncrescendo whine of gears.\n My father was taking me to the clinic in Maidstone, as he would do at\n\nintervals for a couple of years after my operation.\n My feelings about these excursions were very mixed.\n I loved the bus ride as much as I hated the clinic.\n Mr Hucks was a jovial man who seemed to enjoy my reverential\n\ninterest in the way he worked the steering wheel \x97 immense in memory \x97 and\n\nthe levers almost as tall as me.\n I was fascinated by the virtuoso play of his feet on an array of\n\npedals almost as numerous, it seemed to me, as those on the church organ,\n\nanother object of wonder.\n I watched his every movement, so that in subsequent games with my\n\nfriend Treddy, who never got to go on the bus and so had to play the part of\n\na horse, I could simulate to perfection every motion, every sound, every\n\nshudder of the Brobdingnagian controls.\n But it was when Mr Hucks, with all the concentration of a\n\nsteeplechaser, swung round the blind bend at the bottom of the hill and put\n\nher to the climb that my fascination mounted to a sort of ecstasy.\n The sound of the engine rose to a howl that alerted passengers\n\nwaiting at The Walnut Tree, well over a mile away.\n The tall gear lever became a blur, and I remember waiting on one\n\noccasion to see if the violent quivering of the steering wheel, transmitted\n\nthrough    Mr   Hucks, would dislodge the drip from\n\nthe end of his nose. \n\n  With diminishing speed and increasing commotion the bus laboured\n\nto the top, paused to catch its breath and still the pounding of its\n\nelderly heart, then turned to glide, effortless as a bird, down to the\n\nvillage of Eccles.\n There I would briefly abandon my scrutiny of Mr Hucks to gaze at\n\nTicklebelly Row, whose outrageous name my father could not resist pronouncing\n\nas we passed.\n It was ( and still is) a long terrace of ordinary brick houses set\n\nat right angles to the road.\n In truth it offered nothing of interest but a fat woman or two\n\nhanging out washing, and a few loungers who sat smoking pipes, waiting for\n\nthe Walnut Tree to open; yet such was the spell of that improbable name that\n\nI gazed on the scene in high expectancy, but I never saw any bellies being\n\ntickled.\n Another landmark for me was Aylesford bridge, a stone structure of\n\ngreat antiquity.\n My enthusiasm for the bridge was aroused, however, not by romantic\n\ndreams of bygone days, but by the challenge it presented to Mr Hucks.\n The main street was narrow, the bridge narrower still.\n Pedestrians would cower against the houses as we clattered down the\n\ncobbled street with only a couple of feet to spare on either side.  \n The residents had of necessity to do a little reconnoitring\n\nbefore venturing out of their front doors.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '86447bf7-8012-49f7-bdce-22a8f5a7353b', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.943284+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9849523901939392, 'non_english_score': 0.015047609806060791}

was his way.\n And so we moved from Halifax to an acreage outside Edmonton, Alberta.\n\n\n\n  I sat on the front steps of our new house and looked at the dead\n\ngrass stretching away to the fence by the dirt road, the shrubs lining\n\nthe drive ready to burst into flames.\n I was stunned by the heat, by the lack of moisture and color.\n I felt like an exile.\n Marooned on a buff colored planet full of hostile, sun-toughened\n\nprairie kids. \n\n  Mom dealt with it her own way.\n She was inside unpacking.\n Not pots or clothes.\n First, her South American hat collection.\n Panamas and bowlers.\n Next, the record player.\n\n\n \n\n  I didn\'t tell him mom was lying flat on her back in the empty\n\nliving room listening to The Tijuana Brass.\n Wearing a Mayan bowler.\n What I did tell him was that I was going to go look for the river.\n\n\n\n  , " Dad said\n\noptimistically.\n &dotted-line; it\n\njust goes in and out.\n The river is always coming from someplace, and then going on to some\n\nother place." \n\n  There were black and white birds that shrieked challenges and\n\nfollowed me from branch to branch part way down the ravine.\n I climbed through papery grass and some thin silver trees, up over a\n\nweed covered berm and discovered the mighty North Saskatchewan. \n\n  It was brown.\n\n\n  My locker partner was Ted Shuchuk.\n He had a virgin upper lip, never shaved, which aspired to a mustache\n\nand achieved only a faint black smudge that disappeared entirely if you\n\nlooked at it from a certain angle.\n His closest friend was a failed eleventh grader everyone called\n\nSnowblower.\n He stored his broken binders, a dumbbell and stray sandwiches on a\n\nrickety, homemade set of plywood shelves.\n Almost every morning I had to brush piles of mouse shit off my books.\n\n\n\n  Ted spruced up the locker with an Olivia Newton John poster and a\n\nNazi flag. \n\n  Cartwright,\n\nwas the first to see the flag, and he cuffed Ted in the side of the head and\n\ntold him to take it down.\n Davison, the drama coach, said\n\nhanging up that particular flag was hateful, insulting and immature, but\n\nTed\'s right. \n\n  I waited a week before mentioning it to my mom.\n Edmonton Journal\n\n and the next day there was a long, if somewhat oblique, editorial about\n\nthe holocaust.\n\n\n \n\nthol tobacco breath on me. \n\n \n\n  " Get out of the way turkey, I\'m going to work out."\n And he began pumping his dumbbell right in front of the locker.\n I had to lean over him to put my liverwurst sandwiches up on that\n\ntiny top shelf. \n\n  My mom said to me: " He can\'t hurt you.\n Don\'t forget that."\n It was late September.\n\n\n  After Hitler was gone, my mom emerged from her hiding place in\n\nthe Black Forest and took a boat to Argentina ( this is how she told it).\n She was drinking hot chocolate on the lower deck, an indescribable\n\nluxury, and someone said, " Eichmann is on this very boat!"\n An old woman, her voice shaking with rage at the diabolical irony of\n\nit.\n And my mom had heard this and been sick: all at once, over the rail,\n\na deep hot-chocolate-colored, evacuating sickness.\n Then she fainted, toppling like a gyro and hitting her head on a deck\n\nbollard.\n She woke up wrapped in a horse blanket, her head pounding, and\n\ndelivered her signature line \x97 in broken English with her eyes still pinched\n\nshut: " Damn to Eichmann."\n My grandmother and the old lady cried.\n My mom never did.\n She said simply: " Then we went to Rio De Janeiro, and I prayed\n\nfor a husband.\n\n\n  I have a

him, an old dog-eared Dell paperback\n\nedition Player Piano, Cat\'s Cradle, Jailbird.\n Phil\'s brother once spent an entire year indoors, reading and\n\nunderlining bits in his Vonnegut collection, then moved to the Yucatan\n\nPeninsula.\n It was enough to make anyone read the underlined bits.\n So we sat out there at the rink and talked about fascism and nuclear\n\nwinter and setting things on fire, until a tanker pulled up and flooded the\n\nrink.\n\n\n  " Goofs with dentures," said Phil, who had a fine eye for\n\ndetails. \n\n \n\n \n\n  Scott Miller was not a zionist, but he knew aircraft statistics\n\nand had read half of Slaughterhouse Five.\n Phil, Scott and I ended up in the same science group.\n Our fourth was Ted.\n He came over and surveyed his team-mates: " Fatso, nerdball and\n\npsycho asthma-head." \n\n \n\n  " But I was fatso last year," Scott said, and Ted hit him without\n\neven looking his direction. \n\n  " Anyone know what this is?"\n Duke, our science teacher, stood at\n\nthe front of the class behind the lab bench, holding a brown crust above his\n\nhead between his fingers.\n Holding it like it might break.\n It looked dead whatever it was.\n\n\n \n\n  " It\'s a resurrection plant," Duke said.\n The brown crust didn\'t deny this.\n\n\n  " And if I said it was alive would you believe me?" he asked, and\n\nsomebody near the window answered aloud, "    No \n\n ." \n\n \n\n  One of the girls got it right.\n " Absolutely," Duke said.\n\n\n  So, we tried to suffocate it.\n Duke and Snowblower put it under the vacuum beaker set up on the\n\ncorner of the lab bench. \n\n  " If it still looks the same in a week, what\'ll we know then?"\n\n\n \n\n  " What\'ll we know?" he asked again after Ted had disappeared to\n\nthe Principal\'s office. \n\n  " That it\'s dead," I said aloud.\n My first unsolicited class answer and, in fact, the right answer.\n\n\n\n  After school, Ted and Snowblower hung out and smoked in the east\n\nstairwell.\n We didn\'t talk to them.\n They hung out with girls, knit vested princesses with platforms,\n\npooca shells and three-dimensional breasts. \n\n  Phil got moods.\n\n\n  Scott walked between us, always talking, sticking a hand out on\n\neither side of him so we all had to stop and listen to him. \n\n \n\n \n\n  " Got your jockstraps for wrestling next week?\n\n\n  After we dropped Scott off at his house, I\'d try to draw Phil\n\nout. \n\n  " Shuchuk\'s into knives hey?"\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  " With a name like McCluskey?"\n He said and peeled off for home.\n\n\n  At night we played Ping-Pong and Yahtzee round robins, and my\n\nmom and I listened to talk radio.\n Every Albertan held a personal opinion on whether the Northern\n\nLights made a noise.\n I saw them a couple times and didn\'t hear anything.\n\n\n  "\n\nExposed-flesh-freezes-in-how-many-seconds"  statistics out of the\n\nnewspaper.\n " 10 seconds.\n\n\n -    O   -    Two   .\n Says here scientists

ammonia\n\ngas.\n\n\n  " Just burn the fucking thing," Ted said, right in one of those\n\nunexpected canyons of silence that a classroom will pass through. \n\n  Everyone turned to look at him.\n Duke closed his eyes and clenched his jaw.\n\n\n  The bell rang.\n " All right.\n The jockstrap hour."\n\n\n  The sponge mat was rolled out in the gym.\n Phil tripped Scott and fell elbow first onto his back.\n " Body slam," he shouted.\n They bounced up, tapped into the finely strung mania webbing through\n\n<l> out the room. \n\n  " Get off the mat!"\n Cartwright emerged from the equipment room.\n Whistle, stopwatch, green sweatsuit cut like real pants with a wide\n\nyellow stripe down the outside of each leg.\n Red eyebrows the same width as his mustache.\n\n\n \n\n  " Ring the mat!"\n\n\n  " Sutcliffe and Nesbitt," Cartwright read off his clipboard from\n\nthe center of the gym glaring around him for silence. \n\n  " Sutcliffe, referee\'s position."\n Sutcliffe hit the mat on all fours.\n Nesbitt kneeled beside him hands on Sutcliffe\'s back, fingers\n\nspread.\n There was silence, I looked up at the ceiling.\n Green rings around the gym lights were a bad omen.\n Silence hovered.\n\n\n  " Nesbitt!" Scott yelled beside me.\n Sutcliffe had done a sit out, sliding out from under Nesbitt\'s hands\n\nand scrambling to his feet.\n They grappled and fell.\n\n\n  " Nesbitt!"\n\n\n  Nesbitt was chest down.\n Sutcliffe was on his back reefing on a half nelson.\n\n\n \n\n \n\nshouted Ted. \n\n  And that appeared to break his spirit.\n Nesbitt resigned with his eyes and rolled.\n One.\n Two.\n\n\n  " Who backed the loser?"\n\n\n \n\n  " I heard some of you yelling," Cartwright said smiling, enjoy\n\n<l> ing the moment, " Some of you, I know, backed the loser." \n\n  After gym, Phil and Scott and I sat in the hallway with our\n\nbacks against the lockers and ate lunch. \n\n  " Meatloaf," Scott said, looking depressed.\n\n\n \n\n  " Very Yiddish Levine, congratulations.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  " All right.\n Meatloaf for the granola bar."\n Scott opened a corner of his sandwich, " It\'s got ketchup and mayo.\n\n\n \n\n  " Oh forget it," Scott said.\n\n\n \n\n  " Herring sandwich?" Scott said, " What\'s with the Yid food\n\nguys,    how am   I supposed to trade here?" \n\n \n\n  We ate and watched the janitor string up red letters that\n\nspelled " Merry Christmas " along the main hallway. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  He climbed down off his step ladder, wiped his forehead with a\n\nrag he took from the pocket of his railway overalls and looked at the sign.\n\n\n\n \n\n  " H-A-N-U-K-K-A-H."\n Scott said.\n So Phil and I punched him until he coughed up a piece of sandwich.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '9a92f1b6-c267-4ac2-bfe2-a94a66be907a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.944415+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9839951992034912, 'non_english_score': 0.01600480079650879}
{'text': 'DENNIS BOCK\n\n\n  My father\'s hobby was storms.\n He pursued them like other men chased women.\n Through the Ontario Weather Centre he\'d find out about a storm coming\n\nin from another province or from New York or Michigan and drive headlong into\n\nit at 80 miles an hour with nothing more than a thermos of black coffee and a\n\ncouple of ham and cheese sandwiches sitting beside him on the passenger\n\nseat.\n Sometimes I\'d hear him leave the house at three in the morning to\n\nchase one down.\n He loved all types of severe weather: waterspouts, funnel clouds,\n\nflooding downpours, hail storms, dust devils, and heat lightning.\n\n\n  Everyone at the Ontario Weather Centre knew my father.\n He used to phone in twice a day looking for reports of significant\n\nweather gathering on the horizon or blowing in from the lakes, then race out\n\nof the house like a man late for his own wedding.\n But he understood storms better than anyone, even better than the men\n\nat the Centre.\n Although he was only an amateur storm watcher, the people at the\n\nWeather Centre often ended up using his reports and eventually began to ask\n\nhis opinion concerning certain storms, what one was doing, where it was\n\nheaded, how long it would last.\n In the strange cabal of significant weather watchers, my father was\n\nquickly making a name for himself.\n\n\n  My mother, on the other hand, did not care for storms.\n She wore her long brown hair done up in a bun, as if battened down\n\ntightly against unexpected winds.\n She worked part-time at the local library organizing something she\n\ncalled the Bear Pit.\n That was her thing.\n With the help of government subsidies, she brought in speakers from\n\naround the province in an effort to enlighten our small community.\n Poets, historians, parachute stunt jumpers, jugglers, race car\n\ndrivers.\n She decided who came, and each speaker was paid a stipend for his or\n\nher trouble.\n It was a mix of artists and adventurers, personalities and nobodies.\n\n\n My father, who would have been an obvious choice, who could have\n\nmarvelled the uninitiated with tales of storm hunting, never took the\n\nlectern.\n My mother never asked him, and he never volunteered.\n In my father\'s failure to appear, the Bear Pit was where my parents\n\nfought out their long, silent battle.\n Maybe that\'s why my mother called it what she did.\n I knew hunting storms was a sore spot between them, first because it\n\nwas a dangerous and crazy thing to be involved in, and later because severe\n\nweather became as threatening to their marriage as an exotic woman who\n\nstormed through town, staying just long enough to get my father to do\n\nsomething rash or irresponsible. \n\n  " This man climbed to the top of Mount Everest," my mother would\n\nsay, halfway through supper.\n A sidelong glance over to my father, the drifting smile that spread\n\nover her face when she believed she had something that would finally capture\n\nmy interest. \n\n  " The incredible thing is he\'s only got one arm.\n Can you imagine the kind of man it takes to do something like that!"\n My father, though, tall and forward-leaning, would sit at the kitchen\n\ntable impassively, unimpressed, rolling his peas around on his plate with his\n\nfork and plotting in his head the course of the nearest squall line or\n\nreviewing statistics from the  Weekly Review of Canadian Climate and\n\nWater  . \n\n  I accompanied my mother to many of the Bear Pit sessions.\n I listened to the stories of a man who\'d rolled across the\n\ncountry in a wheelchair, a woman who kept more than 200 snakes in her base\n\n<l> ment, the life story of a pair of Siamese twins, now separated, and a\n\ndistinguished professor talking about his newest book on the Louis Riel\n\nuprising of 1869.\n But already, at the age of ten, storms were my passion.\n I knew the difference between bead lightning and ball lightning, and\n\nthat the scientific community was split on whether the latter actually\n\nexisted.\n My father had beaten my mother to me.\n By the time I was 13 I knew more about storms than any science\n\nteacher at my high school.\n I won first prize for my grade 9 Science Fair project when I produced\n\na contained tornado by joining two Coke bottles at the neck with a snipped\n\nballoon end, one holding ten ounces of water.\n The clincher was when I rated my homemade storm on a miniaturized\n\nFujita F-scale, calculating the strength of my whirlwind and the damage in\n\nreal dollars that an equivalent full-scale tornado would bring to our small\n\ntown of Nobleton, Ontario.\n I knew that a tornado was called a " " funnel cloud"\n\n" until it came to earth, that Ontario\'s hail season had begun on\n\nschedule that same year when hail stones were reported at Cootes Paradise on\n\nthe fourteenth of March, and that it would probably last upwards of 170 days,\n\nwell into September. \n I knew during our last severe weather season we\'d had 29 tornadoes\n\nacross the province, concentrated into 14 storm days.\n During a severe weather season that lasted some 45 days, 14 tornado\n\ndays made for about a 30 per cent season.\n\n\n  This year we were aiming for ten individual tornadoes, or roughly\n\na third of what the province could expect to experience in one season.\n\n\n  Whatever points I gained in science class in those days, my\n\nfather and I lost at home with my mother.\n Although she insisted on taking me to her Bear Pit sessions all the\n\nway up to grade 12, deep down inside I think she realized in whose footsteps\n\nI would follow since the day my father took me to see my first tornado, when\n\nI was six years old. \n\n  " We\'ve got sightings of funnels out near Tillsonburg," I remem\n\n<l> ber him saying that afternoon as he wrote something in the pad of paper\n\nhe always kept with him.\n He\'d just gotten off the phone with the Weather Centre, which had\n\nbeen tracking a thunder storm for the last few hours.\n I remember looking out the window at the still trees across the\n\nstreet, then at my mother.\n She was standing at the sink, scraping leftovers into a plastic\n\nTupperware dish.\n My father closed the note pad and slid his pencil behind his right\n\near.\n " If we\'re lucky it\'ll turn into something serious and suck up a cow\n\nor two," he said and winked at me.\n\n\n  As we drove west to Tillsonburg my father told me what I could\n\nexpect from a storm like the one we were heading into.\n He said if the funnel decided to touch down it would only be a baby\n\ntornado.\n " Barely an F-0," he said, cryptically.\n As he spoke his eyes roamed the horizon, hoping, I knew, for airborne\n\nmaterial.\n Every 15 minutes he radioed the Weather Centre with an update.\n\n\n\n  " We might not see anything today.\n I should warn you.\n But they\'ve got funnel sightings coming into the Centre.\n That\'s a good sign, at least.\n Tornadoes are finicky things."\n\n\n  I learned\n\nhow less than one per cent of thunderstorms manifest themselves as tornadoes,\n\nhow all conditions have to be just right for one to form.\n I learned that the world-renowned meteorologist, Professor T.\n\nTheodore Fujita, had just developed an ingenious system which helped predict\n\na tornado\'s potential destructiveness based on its wind speed.\n Backtracking, my father explained the Fujita system to me thoroughly,\n\ninterrupting himself now and then to ask if I had any questions.\n " No," I said and slowly poured him some black coffee from the\n\nthermos, trying to remember all the things he\'d just told me.\n A gust of wind bumped the car ever so slightly, as if to lend weight\n\nand credibility to my father\'s understanding of tornadoes, his explanation of\n\nthe heavens, and a hot black ribbon of coffee jumped into my lap from\n\nthe thermos spout. \n\n  " What you can explain can\'t hurt you," he said as I handed him\n\nthe plastic thermos cup, the coffee spreading across my thigh.\n " There\'s nothing to be afraid of from a tornado if you know what\n\nyou\'re dealing with.\n\n\n ."\n He stopped talking and blew over his coffee.\n " I guess you know your mom doesn\'t approve of me bringing you out\n\nhere." \n\n  " Is she mad at us?"\n " No, she\'s not.\n But she\'s a girl," he said, " and girls don\'t understand the fun\n\nstuff like storms." \n\n  The afternoon turned black around four o\'clock, and two miles\n\neast of Delhi we pulled over to the side of the road and let the centre\n\nof a baby F-0 tornado pass over us. \n\n  " Roll down your window," my father said excitedly.\n Newspapers and plastic bags whirled frantically around the car.\n A pickup truck and two other cars were pulled up onto the side of the\n\nroad, more storm hunters like my father.\n I rolled down the window and a gust of wind reached in and tousled my\n\nhair, the way one of the Siamese twins at the Bear Pit had done after his\n\ntalk.\n Sand and grit blew over my face.\n " Stick out your hand," he said.\n He had his window rolled down the same as mine.\n " You\'re touching it, Gordie!" he shouted.\n\n\n  After the tornado dissipated we got out of the car and talked to\n\nthe other storm watchers.\n I didn\'t understand much of what they said.\n My knowledge of storms was still limited to what my father had told\n\nme on our way there.\n I stood beside him, holding his hand while they compared notes.\n He knew them from other sightings.\n They all knew each other\'s names.\n My father offered around his coffee and sandwiches, and an old lady\n\nfrom Bond Head cut a slice of chocolate cake for me, which I ate sitting on\n\nthe hood of our car.\n On our way home my father asked me again if I had any questions about\n\nwhat we\'d seen.\n Outside of Cambridge he pulled into a McDonald\'s and bought us each\n\nan ice cream cone. \n\n  " Guess what," I said to my mother when we got home a few hours\n\nlater.\n " We shook hands with the tornado."\n\n\n  " You did no such thing," she said, scrubbing the grit and sand\n\nfrom my ears. \n\n  We were going to celebrate our tenth storm season together\n\nchasing down severe weather by shooting for roughly a 30 per cent view rate.\n During our best season we\'d managed barely 20 per cent, mostly F-0s.\n We\'d have to make it to one in three tornadoes of the expected 30 or\n\nso, not including waterspouts, dust devils, and funnel clouds.\n We were aiming high, but it was my last year at high school.\n I\'d accelerated two grades and had already been accepted at the\n\nUniversity of Chicago to begin an undergrad that would lead me into\n\nmeteorology.\n Before going I would spend a year at the Pikes Peak synoptic weather\n\nstation in Colorado, 14,110 feet above sea level.\n I\'d gotten an internship there through my grade 13 physics\n\nteacher, whose brother headed The National Meteorological Centre in Camp\n\nSprings, Maryland.\n I would have a bird\'s eye view of the entire northwestern quarter of\n\nthe continent.\n After ten months I would leave for Chicago, where I hoped eventually\n\nto study under the eminent meteorologist, Professor Fujita.\n\n\nsendoff   send-off   . \n\n  During the late spring of 1985, just before school got out, I\n\nspent my lunch hours in the lab, working on some experiments I would develop\n\nlater at Chicago.\n On a Tuesday my father called the school from the nuclear power\n\nstation where he worked as a lab technician.  \n , and I went\n\ndown to the office to take the call.\n " Gordon," he said.\n The secretary was watching me out of the corner of her eye.\n " We\'ve got a serious squall line moving in from

{'text': 'BILLIE MARKUS\n\n\n  Laine had a seat and Lois didn\'t.\n That was the reason Lois noticed him, that plus the fact that he was\n\nas flawless as an air-brushed photograph from a glossy men\'s magazine,\n\nincongruously pasted onto the crazyquilt background that was the south\n\n<l> bound train.\n He was three-dimensional.\n She checked, because he could have easily been mistaken for a\n\nprecisely executed cardboard cut-out, absorbed in an issue of the \n\nFinancial Times  , grey trousered legs crossed at the knee, cashmere\n\novercoat gaping just wide enough for a peek at his silk paisley muffler;\n\nneither a cuff nor a crease, nor a strand of his blond blow-dried hair out of\n\nplace. \n\n  Rush hours had a detrimental effect on Lois\'s brain.\n She worked freelance on her photography so that she could ride the\n\npublic transit on off-hours, sacrificing the extra cash for peace of mind.\n Occasionally an art director, envious of her liberty, would insist on\n\nan early meeting.\n Then Lois would find herself swinging from an overhead pole designed\n\nto accommodate the average arm length of a Sumatran orangutan, cursing the\n\nkarma that denied her a seat, the space between her ears resounding with the\n\npop and fizzle of her misfiring neurons. \n\n  Laine sat directly below her that morning, calmly leafing through\n\nthe stock market report, his entire immaculate being focused on the\n\nmethodical march of figures down the pink newsprint page.\n Lois hated him then, and when he folded his paper and unfolded his\n\nlegs, she got great satisfaction from beating him out the doors.\n\n\n  " I don\'t normally ride the subway at rush hour," Lois said, as\n\nmeans of an apology, attempting to brush the subway station slime off the\n\nback of Laine\'s overcoat with one hand while gathering the scattered pages of\n\nhis paper in the other.\n The wave of exiting passengers surged around their stationary\n\nfigures, leaving dusty footprints on Lois\'s fallen portfolio.\n Laine accepted the crumpled ball of newsprint with a tight smile that\n\nnever reached his eyes, flicked a stray strand of hair back into place, and\n\nadjusted the creases on his soiled trousers.\n Lois prayed he wouldn\'t demand drycleaning expenses she couldn\'t\n\nafford.\n " Can I buy you a coffee or something?" She asked.\n There was a flicker of interest behind his cool blue eyes.\n\n\n  At the window seat at the Subway Sip\'n\'Snack, watching the com\n\n<l> muters rush past, Laine confided his own inexperience on public transit.\n " Normally I drive, but I\'m between cars at the moment.\n My new Saab\'s due in at the end of the week."\n Outside the plate glass window a woman in a tattered coat, dyed grimy\n\ngrey from years spent on the street, dug deep into a garbage can, fished out\n\na grease-stained paper bag in one arthritic claw, retrieved the half-eaten\n\nchocolate glazed donut from the shadowy depths, and shuffled towards the next\n\ncan dragging her shredded shopping bags behind her. \n\n  " I could tell, I mean about you not riding very much," Lois\n\nsaid.\n " You looked like you belonged in some English country garden, like\n\nthe ones in those house and garden magazines, or at a polo match with the\n\nQueen Mum.\n\n\n  Laine laughed, flashing a set of even white teeth, obviously\n\npleased by the choice of settings she\'d selected for him.\n\n\n  " I was jealous," Lois admitted, surprised at her honesty and\n\nblaming it on the strong coffee and the unnatural earliness of the hour.\n " You had a seat and I saw you sitting there, totally oblivious to\n\neverything except your newspaper."\n She rotated half turns on her stool as she spoke.\n " I\'ll bet you didn\'t even notice the grey-haired guy in the seat\n\nnext to you."\n Laine shook his head no and signalled for the waitress to refill\n\ntheir cups. \n\n  " He was picking his nose and eating it," Lois said, adding\n\nsugar.\n Laine was having trouble getting his mouthful of coffee down.\n " The more you ride the trains," she continued, failing to notice the\n\ngreenish hue behind his freckles, " the harder it is to ignore the craziness.\n You\'d think a person would get better at blocking it out, but it\'s\n\nquite the opposite."\n She dampened a corner of her napkin in her coffee cup and wiped away\n\nthe footprints from her portfolio.\n " It must be nice driving alone in your own car, without worrying\n\nabout some joker drooling on your shoulder pads." \n\n  Laine insisted on covering the bill.\n They walked through the station together, but the hustle and\n\nbustle of pre-work anxiety made conversation impossible. \n\n  A legless harmonica player blocked the exit at the top of the\n\nstairs, forcing all departing passengers to step over him while he stumbled\n\nthrough a rendition of " Oh When the Saints."\n Lois stopped to toss two quarters into his hat.\n Laine was checking his watch when she caught up with him at the\n\nstreetcar stop. \n\n  " I always give money to the subway musicians," she explained.\n\n\n  " I didn\'t see any musician," Laine stepped off the curb to check\n\nfor an approaching streetcar, " but if I don\'t get to work soon, I can kiss\n\nmy commission goodbye." \n\n  Lois stuck out her mittened hand, " Sorry about your pants and\n\neverything.\n\n\n  Laine took her hand in his pig-skinned glove and held onto it\n\nwhile he was talking.\n " I\'m a 39-year-old bachelor," he said, blue eyes locked onto her\n\nbrown.\n\n\n  It was raining when Laine picked Lois up that Friday night in\n\nfront of the Queen Street subway.\n Laine assumed that the rendezvous point was a security measure.\n Lois had her own reasons.\n After that first encounter she\'d returned to her studio apartment and\n\nsmelt the stench of cat pee for the first time.\n The tomato sauce encrusted on the walls of the refrigerator was\n\ndisgusting, the half-inch layer of dust covering her books and lamp shades\n\nwas unbearable, and the haphazard lifestyle she\'d chosen for her 27-year-old\n\nself seemed as childish and silly as her collection of battery-powered\n\nbeanies. \n\n  The black Saab nuzzled up to the curb.\n Laine jumped out, unfurled a blue and green golf umbrella, and opened\n\nthe passenger door with a flourish that reminded Lois of Sir Walter Raleigh\n\nbefore the gout set in.\n She couldn\'t remember the last time she\'d dated a man with a car, and\n\nLaine\'s easy gallantry made her anxious and suspicious.\n " Just relax," he said, turning the key in the ignition, and giving\n\nLois the uneasy feeling that she was about to go under the drill in the\n\ndentist\'s chair.\n The automatic seatbelt hummed along its track, pinned her into\n\nposition with an authoritative click, held her body captive in the bucket\n\nseat without asking permission.\n She worked an arm free and fumbled in her bag for her X-acto knife,\n\nthe only defence she had against Laine and his diabolical car.\n She speculated that the elaborate dashboard lights, a panorama of\n\n******florescent***** dials, blinking bulbs, and spiralling arrows, were\n\nhypnotic tools; she battled falling under their spell while Laine pulled out\n\ninto traffic. \n\n  " I haven\'t been in a car for a while," Lois said, bracing\n\nherself straight-armed against the dashboard when Laine braked for a red\n\nlight. \n\n  " I don\'t know how you do it."\n Laine geared down and jiggled the leather sheathed shift in neutral.\n " From what you told me, the subway\'s more like an insane asylum\n\nthan anything else." \n\n  " Aside from rush hour, it\'s not that bad."\n His concern was charming, but Lois wanted to make it perfectly\n\nclear that she could take care of herself.\n\n\n  Laine flipped open the box beside his armrest, selected a CD, and\n\ninserted it into the player, brushing Lois\'s leg as his hand returned to the\n\ngear shift.\n\n\n  " What\'s that supposed to mean?"\n\n\n  " It means that you don\'t strike me as the type of person who\n\nlunches on the contents of her nose or drools on shoulders," Laine said,\n\neither unaware of her peevish tone or ignoring it.\n\n\n  Lois giggled in spite of herself and loosened her grip on the\n\nX-acto knife.\n The outlines of streetlamps, lighted store windows, and parked cars\n\nrushed past the Saab\'s windshield, glistening in the glare of the halogen\n\nlights.\n The top-of-the-line radial tires splashed through puddles covering\n\nice blocked sewer grates, dousing the deserted sidewalks.\n Laine wove in and out of traffic, accelerating to beat the orange\n\nlights, squeezing so close to the cars and curbs that Lois could have easily\n\ntouched them through an open window.\n In the passenger seat she was nearer to the cityscape than the street\n\n<l> car or subway ever permitted, but farther too.\n\n\ncd  on all four speakers, the city sped by soft and dark, an\n\nentity to be traversed rather than experienced.\n She leaned her head back on the headrest, luxuriating in the\n\nknowledge that she was the first person to do so, inhaling the aroma of\n\nthe brand new black leather interior. \n\n  Lois boarded the northbound train at 3:30 p.m. empty-handed.\n She was a single-minded shopper by nature, definite, as most artists\n\nare, concerning her likes and dislikes.\n Today, for the first time since the onset of adolescence, she\n\nagonized over interminable racks and display tables, anxious to select\n\nan item to Laine\'s taste.\n The saleswomen had been obliging at first, sizing her up with bright\n\neyes, listening patiently with their heads tilted to one side to her vague\n\nrequests, fussing and fluttering over her when she emerged from the change\n\nrooms.\n Despite their cheerful chatter and coos of encouragement, the figure\n\nwearing sporty tweeds or fuzzy pink angora sweaters reflected in the\n\nfull-length mirror was as unfamiliar to Lois as the suburban bus schedule.\n In time, the saleswomen dropped their facade of friendliness, aban\n\n<l> doning Lois to her impossible task. \n\n  The ordeal had taken much longer than planned, leaving Lois hot\n\nand bothered and on the cusp of rush hour.\n She found a place to sit, but after two stops, the car was packed.\n\n\n\n  " Have a seat," she said, rising so that a tiny white-haired lady\n\nin a blue beret could rest her feet. \n\n  " That\'s very kind of you, dear."\n The lady slid gratefully onto the bench, her galoshes dangling six\n\ninches above the floor. \n\n  " My pleasure."\n Lois glared meaningfully at a pair of teenaged boys in private school\n\nuniforms across the aisle.\n They were engrossed in an electronic game while an old man on\n\ncrutches clutched the metal pole beside them, threatening to topple over in\n\nthe subway\'s unpredictable pitch and sway. \n\n  " Respect is dead and gone," the tiny lady said, to no one and\n\neveryone at the same time.\n She crossed her slender ankles and folded her gloved hands on top of\n\nthe royal blue bag that matched her beret.\n " Don\'t misconstrue my meaning, I\'m not referring to the social\n\nniceties that had men giving their seats to women on the tram while they beat\n\ntheir own wives at home.\n What I\'m talking about," she raised her voice, in case some of the\n\npassengers in the far corner were having difficulty hearing, " is the\n\ncivility and consideration we owe the other beings inhabiting this planet,\n\nhuman or otherwise." \n\n  The teenaged boys looked up from their game long enough to\n\nsnicker and observe at full 15-year-old decibel level that the tiny lady was\n\nboth weird and stupid.\n The advertisements mounted above the seats suddenly took on a\n\nmesmerizing fascination for the other passengers.\n " Look away if you like," the lady warned, " but if you don\'t\n\nsmarten up soon, there won\'t be one piece of the world left to look away at."\n\n\n\n  The train clattered along the tracks, carrying 60 captive\n\naudience members past the backsides of highrise apartment blocks and\n\nalongside four lanes of already backed-up expressway traffic.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '78510042-b002-4539-9443-da7b6fd84933', 'added':

 \n\n\n\n  house, there is a\n\nshallow crystal bowl filled with 10 ceramic balls.\n They are like billiard balls without the weight, Christmas baubles\n\nwithout the hooks.\n They are perfect and useless, bright globes of pure colour.\n I am forbidden to touch them and, being a good girl, I don\'t.\n Only my mother handles them.\n I suppose my father could too if he wanted but he doesn\'t.\n Once a week my mother removes the balls one by one from the bowl and\n\npolishes them with a soft rag, a piece of my old nightie with ducks and bun\n\n<l> nies on it.\n She lines the polished balls up like beads at the edge of the table\n\nagainst the wall.\n They make my heart ache.\n Occasionally she lets me hold one: the red one, the green one, just\n\nfor a minute now, the blue one is my favourite, be careful.\n This is how I know the balls are nearly weightless.\n Occasionally I imagine smashing them one by one against the wall.\n More often I imagine juggling them in slow motion, a luminous halo of\n\ncolours suspended over my head. \n\n  In 1989, Anthony Gatto of the United States juggled 5 clubs with\n\n<l> out a drop for 45 minutes and 2 seconds.\n That same year, Jas Angelo of Great Britain juggled 3 objects without\n\na drop for 8 hours, 57 minutes and 31 seconds.\n In 1990, in Seattle, Washington, 821 jugglers kept 2,463 objects in\n\nthe air simultaneously.\n Each person juggled at least 3 objects.\n The nature of these objects is not noted, nor how high or how long\n\nthey were airborne. \n\n  I try to learn how to juggle from a book but I can\'t get the hang\n\nof it.\n\n\n\n  When my mother is happy, she bakes.\n She gets up before my father and me and ties an apron over her\n\nnightgown.\n She rattles and hums in the warm yellow kitchen while it\'s still dark\n\noutside.\n If I get up early enough, she lets me measure the flour, the butter,\n\nthe brown sugar which must be tightly packed into the measuring cup.\n If I sleep later, entering the dining room is like coming downstairs\n\non Christmas morning.\n The bowl of ceramic balls on the perfectly polished table is\n\nsurrounded by hot pies with flaky lattice crusts and multi-layered cakes with\n\nwhite or chocolate icing in delicate swirls on top.\n Sometimes I am allowed to have a piece of cake or pie after\n\nbreakfast.\n All morning at school I walk around with the weight of it in the\n\nbottom of my stomach, the taste of it still sweet on the back of my tongue.\n\n\n\n  The largest apple pie ever baked was made by Chef Glynn Christian\n\nin a 40 <typeface> X </typeface> 23 foot dish in Chelsfield, Great Britain,\n\nin August 1982.\n The pie weighed 30,115 pounds and was cut by Rear-Admiral Sir John\n\nWoodward.\n The largest cake ever baked weighed 128,238 pounds and 8 ounces,\n\nincluding 16,209 pounds of icing.\n Created in the shape of the state of Alabama, the cake was made to\n\ncelebrate the centenary of Fort Payne.\n Prepared by a local bakery called Earth Grains, it was cut by\n\n100-year-old resident Ed Henderson on 18 October 1989.\n The flavour of the cake is not noted, nor how much longer Ed\n\nHenderson lived. \n\n  When my mother is unhappy, we go without dessert.\n But even when she is in her bedroom crying with the door shut, the\n\nrest of the house is still filled with the fragrance of her baking, and my\n\nfather is still smiling.\n On my birthday, whether my mother is happy or not, she bakes me a\n\nspecial chocolate cake with nickels in it. \n\n\n  My diary is a small pink book with gilt-edged pages and a tiny\n\ngold lock and key.\n In it, I am allotted one page per day, one tissue-thin page covered\n\nwith fine blue lines.\n No matter what does or doesn\'t happen on any given day, I feel\n\nobliged to fill each page.\n I briefly note the events of home and school: The math test was hard.\n My mother made me clean my room.\n\n\nslide. \n\n  On boring days, I pay cursory attention to world events: Canada\n\ncelebrates its centennial.\n The world\'s first successful heart transplant is performed in\n\nSouth Africa.\n Martin Luther King, Jr, is shot and killed in Memphis.\n Robert Kennedy is shot and killed in Los Angeles.\n Jackie Kennedy marries Aristotle Onassis.\n death toll in Vietnam passes 30,000.\n\n\n\n  Mostly, though, I write about the future.\n I describe in detail the man I will marry.\n I choose names for our 3 perfect children and our dog.\n Sometimes I draw pictures of the house we will live in, the car we\n\nwill drive, the dress I will wear on our wedding day.\n If the present is frequently confusing, at least the future and the\n\nexquisite weight of its abundant possibilities are always clear.\n Even from this distance, I can see the colour of his eyes, the smile\n\non my lips, the never-ending song in my heart. \n\n  The largest mirage ever recorded was sighted in the Arctic at\n\n83&degree;N 103&degree;W by Donald B. Macmillan in 1913.\n It included hills, valleys, and snow-capped peaks extending\n\nthrough at least 120&degree; of the horizon.\n " " Fata\n\nMorgana," "  so called because such visions were formerly\n\nbelieved to be the nasty work of Morgan le Fay, King Arthur\'s evil fairy\n\nhalf-sister.\n The technique used to measure and record a mirage is not\n\ndescribed. \n\n  I have all the confidence in the world.\n I wear the key to my diary on a chain around my neck like a locket.\n Being a good girl, I naturally assume that I will eventually be\n\nthe recipient of an appropriate measure of eternal happiness.\n\n\n\n  I fall in love every time I turn around.\n I am supposed to be studying Philosophy and the great works of\n\nLiterature, but I am drinking coffee in the university cafeteria and\n\nfalling in love instead.\n Even Plato had a theory of desire.\n I am always ready to be swept off my feet, even when I\'m sitting\n\ndown.\n I fall in love with a wrist on a table, a thigh in blue denim, a lock\n\nof black hair, the tickle of a moustache, the tender angle of a manly neck\n\nbent towards me.\n I pick up the electricity in the air, the force fields of handsome\n\nmen who mill around me, until my stomach feels charred and my hands are shak\n\n<l> ing.\n This could be from all that caffeine, but I take it to be another\n\nsymptom of love. \n\n  The only person in the world to be struck by lightning 7 times\n\nwas ex-park ranger Roy C. Sullivan of Virginia,  usa  .\n His attraction for lightning began when he was struck in 1942 and\n\nlost his big toenail.\n In July 1969 he lost his eyebrows.\n In July 1970 his left shoulder was seared.\n In April 1972 his hair was set on fire.\n In August 1973 his hair was set on fire again, and his legs were\n\nseared.\n In June 1976 his ankle was injured.\n In June 1977, struck while fishing, he suffered burns to his\n\nstomach and chest.\n In September 1983 he died by his own hand, reportedly after being\n\nrejected by the woman he loved.\n\n\n  My best friend tells me I\'m addicted to love.\n I say, At least it\'s more harmless than heroin.\n\n\n\n  The men I love don\'t love me back.\n I sleep with them anyway.\n The men I don\'t love call me in the middle of the night, crying or\n\ncursing because I won\'t sleep with them.\n I feel like I\'m banging my head against a wall, one of those stucco\n\nwalls with bits of coloured ground glass embedded in it. \n\n  Melanerpes\n\nerythrocephalus   , hits the bark of a tree with an\n\nimpact velocity of 13 mph.\n This means that when the head snaps back, the brain is subject to a\n\ndeceleration of approximately

the way other\n\nwomen try on a new coat.\n It doesn\'t fit.\n I try learning to live without desire, but I can\'t get the hang of\n\nit.\n\n\n\n  My husband is a poet.\n His poetry is epic, anguished, and rhyming.\n Although no one will publish his work, he refuses to compromise his\n\nartistic integrity by catering to the marketplace.\n He is sure he will be famous someday, perhaps posthumously.\n In the meantime, he drives a taxi to pay the bills.\n\n\ntv  , eating potato chips, and thinking great thoughts.\n He hasn\'t written a poem in 6 months.\n In that time he has gained 10 pounds from all those chips, and I\n\nhave gained 20 because I am pregnant.\n His depression grows in direct proportion to the size of my belly.\n He eats more chips and changes the channel.\n His shirt is covered with crumbs.\n At least he\'s dressed.\n The living room is filled with his misery.\n I read baby name books in the kitchen.\n Sometimes I think that the couch with the weight of him and his\n\ndepression on it will eventually crash through the floor and plummet directly\n\nto the centre of the earth. \n\n  The deepest depression so far discovered is the bedrock of the\n\nBentley Subglacial Trench in Antarctica at 8,326 feet below sea level.\n The greatest submarine depression is an area of the Northwest\n\nPacific floor that has an average depth of 15,000 feet.\n The deepest exposed depression on land is the shore surrounding the\n\nDead Sea, now 1,310 feet below sea level.\n The rate of fall in the lake surface has been 13 3/4 inches per year\n\nsince 1948. \n\n  My husband says he cannot possibly be a poet and a parent at the\n\nsame time.\n He reads Paradise Lost and sometimes speaks in iambic pentameter.\n I borrow books on childbirth and breastfeeding from the library.\n\n\n\n  We talk and we talk and we talk.\n We cry.\n He makes up his mind and then changes it hack again.\n Finally he goes out, ostensibly to buy a bag of chips.\n He returns an hour later with a 3-piece set of matching luggage,\n\nsoft-sided in royal blue with locks and tiny keys like the one I had for my\n\ndiary in Grade 8.\n He fills the biggest suitcase with books.\n It is so heavy he cannot lift it.\n He rearranges the contents of the suitcases to achieve a more even\n\ndistribution of weight.\n He sets them in the back porch and calls a taxi.\n He kisses me goodbye.\n We

{'text': 'FAYE SCOTT RIEGER\n\n\n\n\n  As they step into the same rivers, other and still\n\nother waters flow upon them.  \n\n\n  As I was telling you \x97 you\'re from Georgia, you said?\n Well, as I was saying I couldn\'t help feeling that everything that had\n\never happened in the journey that is my life until then came to bear on the\n\nrunaway, careening conversation I was having with Sergeant Robert McRoberts\n\nat District Station No. 2 of the York Regional Police on Major MacKenzie\n\nRoad, in the busy but still pretty town I live in, Richmond Hill, Ontario,\n\nCanada.\n You see, I knew it was important just how I told the sergeant about\n\nthe dream I\'d had about my missing husband.\n My intention was to communicate with him in his own Canadian idiom.\n First, I would speak only in my from-nowhere-in-particular TV\n\nbroadcaster\'s voice.\n Experience has taught me that if this Ontario policeman got so much\n\nas a whiff of my Texas accent his eyes would have glazed over like cherry\n\nfilling in a cooling pie, terrified I might hog-tie him, and force-feed him\n\nchili dogs and cornbread.\n Secondly, I would not let my churning guts reflect in any of my\n\nfacial expressions.\n People here think of me as eccentric, and this was not the time to\n\nappear as such.\n I didn\'t want my dream about Ned to sound like the most crazy and\n\nostentatious,   deus-ex-machina   of dreams that\n\nthis fella ever heard.\n I needed the sergeant\'s help, so I wanted the dream to sound as\n\ntruthful as I knew it to be.\n Why was I so sure?\n\n\n  You see, my momma was pregnant with me when she was struck by\n\nlightning.\n She, and by extension myself, had leaned over to pick up a basket of\n\nlaundry when the lightning hit.\n My daddy looked out from the kitchen window just in time to see a\n\nskinny, jagged line of light dive right at Momma\'s back.\n She went stomach first into the laundry basket.\n Luckily, the basket wasn\'t completely full and there was room for me.\n I was born with a slight head tremor, which since Ned has been\n\nmissing has become as vigorous as a stripper\'s shimmy dance.\n But let me tell you, not all of that chance lightning-strike was bad.\n There is nothing I can prove, but I\'ve always had a notion that as I\n\nlay in my momma\'s womb I was as unwritten upon as a tiny  \n\ntabula rasa   until Kablam! \x96 the lightning hit and cursed /\n\nblessed me with my tremor, my assorted creative talents, and my name,\n\nJubilee Hightower.\n My daddy was so glad to have my momma and me escape death, he named\n\nme Jubilee.\n It is a name I\'ve had to live up to or live down, depending on which\n\ntime or place in my life journey we\'re speaking of.\n But I also believe the lightning flash out of the blue gave me my\n\non-again, off-again clairvoyance.\n If you\'ve ever experienced clairvoyance yourself, you\'ll know it can\n\nwork at both significant and silly moments.\n You might suddenly know where your lost hanky is at, or you might\n\nsuddenly know your friend in Sarajevo has been hit by a bullet.\n So that is how I know this dream about Ned is true.\n Now if you\'re a sceptic you\'ll say I\'m crazy, but, in fact, that\n\ndream is a big chunk of the story of how I got all the way from Texas to\n\nToronto, and why I\'m on this bus with you to Algonquin Park, which is what\n\nyou asked me about in the first place. \n\n  As I said, everything depended on Sergeant McRoberts believing\n\nwhat I had to tell him about my dream, but I felt scattered, heart-sore, and\n\ncompletely alone, and so far all I had managed to do was answer questions\n\nthat were in my head rather than the ones the sergeant was asking.\n As you might expect, he had his own agenda and his own order in which\n\nhe wanted to receive information from me.\n\n\n \n\n  I told him what time Ned had left on Friday and repeated it was\n\nnow Monday and he was a day late. \n\n \n\n  I told him he was forty-five, but I expected we\'d all be a lot\n\nolder before I could get anyone to look for him, and that I couldn\'t\n\nunderstand why the Park Rangers would want to wait a day before they searched\n\nfor him just because there had been a thunderstorm; a thunderstorm does not\n\nprevent you from leaving a place when you know there are people waiting for\n\nand worrying about you \x96 unless you\'re in trouble! \n\n  The sergeant asked Ned\'s occupation, but I had the need just\n\nthen, as if Ned had suddenly swept through the doors of that police station\n\nand given me one of his great big bear hugs, to tell about how Ned and I met\n\nat a party so long ago at the Alpha Epsilon fraternity house at William Smith\n\nand Hobart College in Geneva, New York, on the self-polluting but still\n\nbeautiful Lake Seneca.\n I told the sergeant, who by now looked helpless to stop me, that I\n\nhad noticed Ned at the party because in the heated debate that was going on\n\namong the six or seven of us, Ned said nothing.\n Ned looked like Grizzly Adams \x96 a gentle face, covered by a ferocious\n\nblond beard.\n And he had draped his big body in a chair by a window that looked out\n\non the lake.\n Ned was not looking at the view, but rather watching the cooing and\n\npecking pigeons on the window\'s ledge.\n Well, believe it or not we were all sober, and believe it or not the\n\nrest of us were not discussing the Vietnam War, but rather the merits of the\n\nopposing philosophies of Heraclitus and Parmenides.\n Was the world a fire-born cauldron of change, or was change mere\n\nillusion, the false opinion of the senses in a world unified and immutable?\n It was the usual group dynamic \x96 the boys in the group were showing\n\noff mostly to each other, while the girls, every once in a while, made an\n\nattempt to get a word in edgewise.\n The argument went back and forth, people taking various positions in\n\nor outside the cauldron, until there was a natural apocalyptic pause in\n\nthe conversation.\n Ned finally spoke from the corner, " Do you think pigeons poo on\n\npeople on purpose?" \n\n  I could see Ned was a man who kept to the particular.\n That aroused my interest.\n I went over to the window and sat down in the chair opposite.\n He looked at me as if he had been expecting me.\n Ned\'s quietness was for me like a cool Lone Star beer on a hot day.\n When we graduated, I was happy to go to Canada with him because I was\n\non my way north anyway. \n\n  Since you\'re an American, you\'ve probably heard that everyone in\n\na small town in Texas wants to leave because they think it\'s better or\n\ndifferent somewhere else, especially a little  girl  in Texas.\n In high school, permissible activities for girls were two: getting\n\nstraight A\'s and showing their panties cheerleading.\n\n\n  I could paint, and I could make things.\n Even though everyone knew my daddy was a carpenter, people begrudged\n\nme my chisel, my saw, my hammer, and my nails.\n They did not like a twelve-year-old girl making a tree house in her\n\nfront yard where everyone could see.\n It just wasn\'t ladylike.\n Well it is no Texas brag to say it was the best and the biggest tree\n\nhouse in the U.S. of A.\n It had two secret compartments and eight hinged doors.\n But never mind its fine quality, what mattered to our neighbors was\n\nthat little girls should not make treehouses. \n\n  So I went to the northeast to college where I found out people\n\ndon\'t like pretty and smart young women to express themselves there either.\n That\'s where I picked up my from-nowhere-in-particular voice \x97\n\nnot on purpose, and not because some well-meaning but prejudiced Yankee\n\nfriend said people would take me more seriously if I dropped my drawl.\n I picked it up mostly by osmosis and because of the weather.\n Your words get sawed off real quick when freezing rain is slapping\n\nyour face. \n\n  Well anyway, I could see Sergeant McRoberts was torn between\n\ncompassion for my plight, and wanting to wring my neck.\n Of course, he was too polite to wring my neck.\n Canadians are as a rule very polite.\n\n\n  After I had related how Ned and I met, Sergeant McRoberts asked\n\nme, " Did Ned have any companions?" \n\n  " Oh, he has some friends," I said, and the sergeant raised his\n\npencil, " but his veterinary practice keeps him very busy.\n Ned is one of those people who has as much rapport with animals as\n\nwith people.\n Our English-setter Chauncey is devoted to Ned.\n The two of them won the Canadian Dog and Master Frisbee Championships\n\nthis year.\n And Ned is fascinated by bears.\n That\'s why he loves camping.\n He is fascinated by everything about bears \x97 their massive size,\n\ntheir hibernation patterns, and also the deadly finality of their cor <l>\n\nruption by humans with our easy, ready-made food.\n Did you know bears who have tasted Doritos are unable to go back to\n\nthe wild?" \n\n  At this point, the sergeant thrust himself back in his chair, and\n\ndrew his large hand slowly over his clean-shaven face, an action which\n\nreleased the very loud cologne he was wearing.\n " I meant," he said, barely hanging onto his patience, " how many\n\nwere in Ned\'s camping group?" \n\n  " Oh.\n He was alone.\n I was supposed to go with him, but they moved up the date of my show\n\nat the McMichael Art Gallery, so I couldn\'t go."\n My eyes began to tear at this point as much from the sergeant\'s\n\ncologne as from my dread guilt about Ned.\n Maybe if I had gone with Ned, I could somehow have prevented all\n\nthis. \n\n  Of course, I didn\'t tell Sergeant McRoberts I had to be at the\n\ngallery because they were showing " Sunny Pyromania," my diorama of the wife\n\nof the first Governor of Upper Canada, Elizabeth Gwillim Simcoe, setting fire\n\nto the Ontario woods.\n I, as the performance artist, had to be there to set the fire.\n\n\n\n  Oh, don\'t worry, the fires of my display were all controlled.\n But you can bet I didn\'t mention my interest in Elizabeth Simcoe\'s\n\npyromania to Sergeant McRoberts.\n And I was right because the next thing I know, the sergeant is\n\nimplying Ned meant to get lost.\n He asked me how well we got along and if I remembered had we had a\n\nbit of a tiff before he left.\n\n\n  " No, we never had a bit of a tiff in our whole married life.\n If I thought Ned had a liking for tiny, whiny tiffs, I would not have\n\nmarried him." \n\n \n\n  hollering   matches we\'ve\n\nhad.\n I had to teach Ned how to do this because he was from a family who\n\nnever had any disagreements that even came close to qualifying as a tiff.\n There was very little observable range of emotion at any time on any\n\none of their pale faces.\n And the emotional elephants that were born, grew up, and swayed\n\nsilently in the middle of their living room over the years outweighed\n\nall the elephants on the vast and unfathomable continent of Africa. \n\n  This, by the way, is one reason why the idea that Ned may have\n\ndisappeared on purpose took me completely by surprise.\n You see, I always thought that I, if anyone, would be the one to\n\nwander off, because despite the beauty of Ontario\'s rolling green hills, the\n\narea is in many ways an inhospitable place for a girl from Texas to live.\n\n \n You might not realize that, this being your first trip to Ontario.', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '4c0f79a0-212f-4b07-b4d6-fd9083fb83c1', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:49.949871+00:00', 'english_score':
