{'text': 'BILL\nTHE INSURANCE (AMENDMENT) BILL \nMr. J.N. Mungai: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Before I was interrupted last Thursday at the rise of the House, I was trying to emphasize on the fact that these levies must be used to educate our people because many insurance companies in the country, if not well taken care of---\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Shikuku): Order! Those who are leaving the Chamber should do so quietly so that they do not interrupt the Member on the Floor of the House.\nMr. J.N. Mungai: Thank you very much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for calling for order so that the House can get our views.\nIn supporting this Bill, I would like to say that the levy that is being sought here should be utilized to educate---\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Shikuku): Order! Order! We can only have one hon. Member on his feet. \nHon. Nassir and those other hon. Members at the Bar, could you, please, sit down or move out? All of you cannot be on your feet at the same time. We can only have one hon. Member on his feet at a time. \nContinue, Mr. Mungai.\nMr. J.N. Mungai: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, this levy that we are talking about must be extended and used to educate the masses in the farms, urban centres and everywhere else, so that the peasants are educated about the use of insurance companies in the country. They should be made to understand what is---\nMr. Ogur: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. When I was out a little while ago, the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife made a statement which was very much in order. This was about total withdrawal of trawlers from Muhuru Bay/Karungu in Nyatike Constituency. Can I be allowed to congratulate him more directly upon---\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Shikuku): Order! Hon. Ogur, you should know that you are completely out of order because we are already on a different Order. You should not do that next time.\nMr. J.N. Mungai: If we use this levy to educate the people we shall not only be assisting our people to understand how they should make use of insurance companies in the country, but we shall also be promoting the growth of insurance funds. At the moment, there is a lot of robbery on those who have taken out insurance by the insurance companies. Many insurance companies, during the time of paying compensation, under-value whatever had been insured.\nFor instance, when the insured are involved in accidents---<\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Shikuku): Order! Mr. Nassir and hon. Nooru, I will not repeat this warning again. We can only have one hon. Member on his feet at any one time. Hon. Nassir and hon. Nooru, would you, please, make efforts to observe that?\nMr. J.N. Mungai: I was saying that underpayment of compensation with regard to accident claims should be looked into seriously. We have had cases where people have insured their vehicles but when they claim compensation as a result of accidents, they are underpaid. I would like to call upon the Minister to make sure that impartial officers from the Ministry are called in to do the valuation of such claims and not just appointees of those insurance firms. This way, the insured will not be robbed in broad daylight.\nMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I gave an example of a person who complained to me that he had insured his vehicle for about Kshs500,00 but when he had an accident three months later, he was compensated by only Kshs150,00. This is just quite impossible. Such a person was driving his own vehicle and I am sure the depreciation of such a vehicle was so minimal that it should not have made the owner lose Kshs250,00 within two months. That is why I am saying that we must educate our people to know how insurance companies operate their business, especially when it comes to paying compensation. The levy we are going to introduce through this Bill must used to educate the insured so that they are not under-compensated by insurance companies.\nIt is also important to educate unsophisticated people in rural areas on the use of insurance. This is important because most of the our people in rural areas are peasants and grow the food that is usually used all over the country, especially in urban centres. They also grow staple crops like maize, wheat and so on. But because they do not understand that food crops can also be insured, when drought strikes they lose both the entire crop and the investment in it. If such peasants were educated through chiefs\' <ea/>barazas, political rallies and other non-governmental *fora>, they would know it is necessary to insure the crops they grow. This is why I am suggesting that this levy should be used to educate both insurance personnel and also small-scale farmers in rural areas.\nI am sure that some of those who live in rural areas are fully informed about the insurance of their farms and buildings. However, such people have been having problems in getting insurance compensation when calamities occur. So, we should go further and educate agricultural officers on how insurance compensation is determined in order to prevent insurers from under-valuing  farmers` crops for compensation purposes. It is also very important for such officers to be assisted by valuation officers from other Ministries.\nAs I said earlier, there are many small-scale and large-scale farmers who understand the use of insurance but who are not covered by insurance. This is why it is important for the Minister to enlighten us on what he really means by "natural calamities". We thought natural calamities could be anything like heavy rains, lightning and so on. But you find that right now very many of our people in the rural areas have lost property through tribal clashes. Some of them had insured their crops, but if the insurance companies will classify this loss as resulting from a natural calamity, this will be very oppressive. This is because we know that whatever has happened in the tribal clash areas has not been a natural calamity; it is has been a calamity created by a few people who want to perpetuate themselves in power. \nQUORUM \nDr. Lwali-Oyondi: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I do not think we have a quorum in the House.\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Shikuku): Let me take a count.\nYes, there is no quorum in the House.\nPlease, ring the Division Bell.\nThere is a quorum now. Mr. J.N. Mungai, you can continue.\nMr. J.N. Mungai: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was trying to say that we must differentiate between natural calamities and calamities created by some people because of reasons best known to themselves. I am on the point of mentioning that we have had tribal clashes recently in the Rift Valley, which are continuing even now. I am wondering whether such clashes can be classified as a \'natural calamity\'.\nMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we know that a car can roll and crash when it is being driven. But we also know that that can happen either because the driver is driving carelessly or something else has happened and made the driver lose control of the vehicle. That is referred to as an accident. But you will realise that many of our farmers in the rural areas who have had to insure things like motor vehicles, homes, crops and animals have suffered big losses. We would like to be told by the Minister, when responding to Members` views, whether this will be considered to be a natural calamity. To me this is not a natural calamity; I would say it is a calamity created for the unfortunate people in the rural areas. I would even go further and ask the Minister to order insurance companies to pay for any losses that have been incurred in the tribal clash-torn areas.\nI say so not forgetting somebody like hon. Keah there who is pointing at me and who I am sure is going to respond to this Bill. If people in the clash areas are not compensated then it will mean that the Government is supporting the oppression of our people. These people have insured their property but the Government has been unable to protect the lives of the people and their property. People have lost lives and property worth millions of shillings. We want this matter to be investigated thoroughly before it is decided upon by the insurance companies, so that the people know whether they are going to lose or gain.\nMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we must also be told whether those who have been involved in inciting such violence will be prosecuted. They must be prosecuted because they have admitted that they have been involved in inciting people to violence. When I say so, I am talking about a person like ole Ntimama. I am sure that many hon. Members may say that ole Ntimama stated in the House here - and he also repeated it outside this House and we have it on record; it was published in the local dailies - that they were going to strive for the rights of their people in their own areas. But those rights of their people also affect the rights of others, which rights were insured. This is why I am saying that the Minister should tell the House whether these people will be compensated.\nMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, last time when I was talking about the problems being caused by this violence, I mentioned the rigging of some Members into this House. When they come to this House they are accepted as Members of this House, yet we know they were rigged into Parliament. This rigging, which has been accepted in this House, has caused a lot of problems and---\nThe Minister for Labour and Manpower Development (Mr. Masinde): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Could the hon. Member, please, stick to the Bill?\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Shikuku): Hon. Mungai, you had better confine yourself to the Bill. Which clause in this Bill talks about rigging?\nMr. J.N. Mungai: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am trying to expound on these issues and I was at the point of---Although I am digressing from the Bill, the people must be educated to understand the importance of insurance. There are some who have made use of insurance because they know the importance of insurance cover. Some of these people had insured their property, and it was destroyed as a result of a man-made calamity and not a natural calamity. That is why I am saying that all this has been promoted by the fact that some people want to evict others from settled areas so that they can create an opportunity for themselves to remain in power and ensure victory in future elections. This is what I am driving at.\nWhat I must also say is that it is unfortunate that somebody like hon. Masinde is standing on a point of order when it was only the other day when he told the nation that Kikuyus must not be allowed to take refuge in Busia as though---\nThe Minister for Labour and Manpower Development (Mr. Masinde): On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. First of all, I was misquoted; my remarks were quoted out of context.\nHowever, may I plead with the hon. Member to come back to the Bill. If he has nothing to tell the House, will the Chair, please, ask him to sit down?\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Shikuku): Order! Order! Hon. Masinde, as much as you may have had a point, you have messed it up because it is not your duty to order any other hon. Member to sit down. I would like to ask hon. Mungai to try - although he is trying his best to say whatever he has to say - to confine himself to the Bill.', 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'e102ed8c-48b2-4e2c-8b01-e7ec33d9c447', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:00.956654+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9821724891662598, 'non_english_score': 0.017827510833740234}
{'text': "BILL\nTHE INSURANCE (AMENDMENT) BILL \n[Mr.J.N. Mungai:] Mr. Speaker, Sir, as you can see, the Bill says that the levy can be paid in instalments. But as you are aware, there is no business in the country. If there is any business, it is so little that it is not favourable. I would like to urge the Minister to withdraw the issue of penalty because the climate as far as business is concerned is not favourable. It is important that the Minister considers the current economic conditions very carefully. It is okay to say that the levy can be paid in instalments, but somebody can fail to remit the money on time due to unfavourable conditions in business. So, it is important that such factors are taken into consideration. Instead of opting for the penalty, why do we not just say that the money must be paid, and if somebody fails to pay he is sued to make sure that he pays it? It is important to bear in mind that whatever we do in this House, we do it for the welfare of our people. We do not do things here just to ensure that the Government makes money by collecting taxes from its own people when the times are not conducive for our people to make money. The times are very rough, not only for our people at home but internationally. We should not discourage our people from participating in an industry like this one by penalising them when they fail to pay. Let us try to assist them so that they can survive during these hard economic times. If we are not careful, it is quite possible that many people might have to withdraw by selling part of their assets. They might even withdraw their participation in the insurance industry because of these penalties, particularly during this time when we are facing very hard economic conditions.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to support the Bill.\nMr. Speaker: Mr. Robert Mungai. \nNot you, Mr. J.N. Mungai. I thought that hon. Njenga Mungai has been here long enough to know that once he has contributed on the same Motion, he cannot speak on the same Motion again. Even if you are prodded by the Chair to breach the Standing Orders, you must resist that at all times.\nMr. J.N. Mungai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did not look behind me to see whether hon. Robert Mungai was there or not. I thought probably I had forgotten to say something.\nMr. Speaker:  Well, we have another Mungai in the House now. Proceed, Mr. Robert Mungai.\nMr. R.K. Mungai: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to support the Bill before the House. In supporting this Bill, I would like to make a few comments.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, we know that currently we have about 40 insurance companies, some of which are insolvent and which still continue to be---\nDr. Lwali-Oyondi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.\nMr. Speaker: Yes, Dr. Lwali-Oyondi.\nDr. Lwali-Oyondi: Mr. Speaker, Sir---\nMr. Speaker: Order, Dr. Lwali-Oyondi. First of all, I do not know whether hon. Mungai has ever made his maiden speech.\nOrder, Mr. Mungai. You will reply to me when I sit down.\nA basic rule again, and we must all be very understanding to hon. Mungai who is a new Member, is that when the Speaker is on his feet, you will all remain seated. When I finish, then you can stand up and respond to me. Have you made your maiden speech?\nMr. R.K. Mungai: No, Sir.\nMr. Speaker: Dr. Lwali-Oyondi, are you interfering with what he is saying?\nDr. Lwali-Oyondi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, mine is a different point of order.\nMr. Speaker: Yes, and what is it?\nQUORUM \nDr. Lwali-Oyondi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not think there is a quorum in the House, and it would be unfair for him to---\nMr. Speaker: If that is the position, Dr. Lwali-Oyondi, you are perfectly in order because the House cannot continue without a quorum. I am informed that there is no quorum. Ring the Division Bell.\nMr. Speaker: Order, hon. Members! We have a quorum now. Proceed, Mr. Mungai.\nMr. R.K. Mungai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I had started to explain, there are 40 insurance companies in this country, and we know that a number of them are trading while insolvent and continue to do this because they are politically patronised. A case in point is the Kenya National Assurance Company which, common knowledge has it, is trading while insolvent and questions have been asked as to whether it should continue doing this. Should this particular company continue trading until it finally becomes solvent? This question is being asked by other insurance companies. What will the rest of the industry be required to pick up should any deficiency arise in the event of a winding-up of the Kenya National Assurance Company?\nMr. Speaker, Sir, there was the Kenya Motor Insurance Pool that used to exist some years back, and it is the wish of the industry that this pool be revived because it was a very useful tool.\nMr. Speaker: Order, hon. Members! The House has already been informed that when an hon. Member is on his feet no other Member shall be on his or her feet except when moving from one place to another. I would ask all hon. Members who stand up unnecessarily in the House that they are in direct contravention of the Standing Orders. We would like to obey all the Standing Orders because that is what makes Parliament.\nMr. R.K. Mungai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in recommending the revival of the former Kenya Motor Insurance Pool, it is suggested that it should be under a new charter and under changed circumstances as we have today. For instance, the Commissioner of Insurance should have very little say on the running of the pool, except in his role as the regulator of the industry.\nIt is the view of the insurance industry that the Commissioner of Insurance has so much power that the industry is at his mercy. This is contrary to the whole process of liberalisation, free trade and privatisation. A lot of information is given to the Commissioner of Insurance in various forms that are submitted to him annually. It is suggested that those forms provide so much data and information that it is almost impossible for the Commissioner to utilise that information effectively. It is also common knowledge that the Commissioner does not have adequate staff to analyse, digest and utilise that information. It is, therefore, suggested by the industry that the forms should contain only information that can be effectively utilised by the Commissioner. \nRegarding the training levy, the idea of setting up the Insurance Training College is in the right direction and the industry is happy about it. However, it is recommended that the college should have adequate and qualified lecturers and administrators; otherwise, it will not serve the envisaged purpose. It is also recommended that the institute should have a relevant comprehensive curriculum developed, which should change with time. The industry would like this kind of curriculum to be approved by the industry itself rather than the Government machinery.\nThe insurance industry should control the running of the college and not the Government in terms of what is to be taught and who is to teach there. The industry has trained and experienced lecturers who should be employed to do that.\nIt is also suggested that the college should explore very, very urgently the possibility of running actuarial courses locally. Currently, all consulting actuaries are trained abroad and it would be in the interest of the insurance industry to have them trained here.\nMr. Speaker: Order, hon. Juma Boy, you must be seated.\nMr. R.K. Mungai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my last point on this Bill is that the levy should be based on some reasonable basis; that is to say, ability to pay. This could be based on the total premiums generated. The insurance industry should consider those points about the requirement on training and the assessment of the trading levy, and the Government too should give its assurance.\nWith those few remarks, I beg to support.\nDr. Lwali-Oyondi: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir.\nThe Bill is quite clear and I support it. I support it because in clause 191(i) (3), it talks of charging levy at the rate of 0.35 per cent. That is quite reasonable. The Government has often tried to charge too much in many areas through VAT. They are trying to get 18 per cent and but they end up losing everything. An example is the VAT charged on spare parts. We talked about it here and the Minister did not quite agree with our sentiments, but to tell him the truth, spare parts are being bought without receipts and in this way, the Government is losing revenue. If they had charged 5 per cent on them, they would have received all the money collected. If you go in for too much capital levy, you will end up with nothing. If you go in for too much profit, your turnover will be little, and any trade depends on high turnover but not the actual profit per unit. In this case, I would commend the Minister for putting that very reasonable percentage, and I am almost certain that nobody will be unable to pay it.\nIf everybody pays, the Minister will have enough money to run the colleges. This should be an example to all other Ministries. There is no need of having big figures and end up with nothing. The monthly payment might involve a lot of paperwork in accordance with Clause 197 - monthly payment. I would have suggested that probably there should be half yearly payments so that we do not have to have too much paperwork and the officers concerned will have less work in demanding for this money on monthly basis.\nI hope that the Minister will use this training levy for the right purpose. This money should not be embezzled or used by people to boast about in <ea/>Harambee meetings. A lot of money is being collected from toll stations, but nobody knows where it goes to. There are rumours, and I do not want to be a rumourmonger, that some people grab this money and---\nMr. Speaker: Order, Dr. Lwali-Oyondi! I have made a ruling in the past that rumours shall not be the subject of any discussion in the House, and if you engage in rumours, you are totally out of order and you shall not proceed on those lines.\nDr. Lwali-Oyondi: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I apologise---\nThe Assistant Minister for Health (Mr. Mutiso): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the hon. Members should take the Standing Orders of this House seriously. When you were on your feet, Sir, one hon. Member was walking around as though he was walking in a market.\nMr. Speaker: Which hon. Member?\nThe Assistant Minister for Health (Mr. Mutiso): That one over there.\nMr. Speaker: Hon. Mutiso, every hon. Member in this House has a name and since you are unable to give the name of the hon. Member who was walking around, you are out of order.\nDr. Lwali-Oyondi: As I said before, the Government has actually complained that it is not getting enough money from toll stations and therefore, it is asking that the system employed in collecting levy should be put into operations at petrol stations. Why do we have insurance companies? Insurance is supposed to provide comfort when a natural or an artificial calamity befalls one. It is futile for a doctor to try to plaster somebody's finger after he has been completely flattened by a lorry. We are talking of insuring people when the Government itself is not insuring the lives of people.", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '6d3ac6eb-2a13-49c2-882a-413ca3f9ad41', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:00.956951+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9745664000511169, 'non_english_score': 0.025433599948883057}

Kiliku, you want to contribute?\nMr. Kiliku: Yes, Mr. Deputy Speaker.\nMr. Shikuku: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I thought I heard Order No. 8 being called.\nThe Deputy Speaker: Yes, The Export Processing Zones Bill and, that is what I presume the hon. Kiliku wants to contribute on.\nMr. Shikuku: Oh, I see!\nThe Deputy Speaker: Hon. Kiliku!\nMr. Kiliku: Thank you very much Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. First, I would like to congratulate the Minister of Finance and the Government for accepting to introduce Export Processing Zone (EPZ) system of investment into this country. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, so far, we have EPZ in Nairobi and Athi River. But I would like to know from the Minister, what has happened to the Miritini EPZ. Miritini, which is in my Constituency was to be the first of the second phase of EPZ, where the Government, through investors, would utilise Ksh.500 million for infrastructure and---\nQUORUM \nMr. Gitonga: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the House has no quorum.\nMr. Deputy Speaker: all right, I confirm that there is no quorum. Will you please ring the Division Bell?\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Order! Order! Order, hon. Members! We now have a quorum. Shall we continue? Hon. Kiliku!\nMr. Kiliku: Thank you very much Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I was just asking the Minister to explain why the Miritini EPZ in Mombasa has not taken off now despite of the fact that it was to be the second phase of the implementation of the EPZ. Unfortunately, the introduction of EPZ into the country has, so far, benefitted very few members of the business community because the Government has not educated the people in this country as to what is an EPZ.\nMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, one of our problems with the EPZ is that the Government must make land available for other developments like transport, health clinics and outing facilities within the EPZ. These are the things which must be available because if they are not there then it will be a problem for the workers there. The Government should also come out with a policy as to whether the workers within the Export Processing Zones (EPZs), especially Kenyans, will be paid their salaries in foreign currency. Since all business transactions within the EPZs is 100 per cent done through foreign currency, the Kenyan workers in those Zones should be paid in foreign currency. The investors have been allowed to operate foreign exchange accounts in the commercial banks and, therefore, the Kenyan workers in those Zones should be paid in foreign currency so that they can also benefit.\nMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, of late when heads of government, either presidents or prime ministers come here they are taken to Sameer Industries. I do not know the relationship between the Government and this industry. Why should visitors be taken to only this one industry and not others if you have to show what is manufactured in this country? At Athi River we have industries within the EPZs. That is a question mark because there must be something between the Government and Sameer Industries, whereby visitors from all over the world are taken. Even once a Minister for Commerce and Industry has been appointed the first thing he does is to go to Sameer Industries and that is where they take their guests. They have forgotten that we have other industries in this country.\nMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have been talking about investments in this country, but the problem is that the *implementers> of Government policies have been scaring off potential investors from coming to this country. Most of the biggest enemies of this country are Ministers who have contributed to the economic problem we are having in this country today. If you do not take a kick-back in the Government, then you are not a good Minister. As I am talking now most of the investors are going to Uganda and the others are going to Tanzania because of the kick-back policy in this country. Unless we change our attitude towards investors, they will not come to this country. For example, as I am talking today, and the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife is here, there is no land available in either Mombasa or Nairobi for the construction of a tourist hotel. The looters of the land have taken all the land, including parking areas, and have left nothing for development. Where are we telling investors to go if we have grabbed all the land in urban areas. In Mombasa they have taken graveyards! <ea/>Wameuza <ea/>makaburi. When you say that you are encouraging investors, where are they going to invest?\nThe Assistant Minister for Research, Technical Training and Technology (Mr. Kagwima): On a point of clarification, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I have been following what the hon. Member is saying very keenly, and one of the things he has said is that plots in Mombasa and Nairobi have been grabbed and, therefore, such plots are not available in this country for investment. Where have the plots been taken? Have they been taken to heaven or to another country? This is what I would like to be told by the hon. Member.\nMr. Shikuku: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I have always had my Standing Orders with me all these years. Could he tell us which Standing Order talks of clarification?\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Order, hon. Members! Hon. Shikuku, when an hon. Member rises on  a point of order, the Speaker avails him the chance, When an hon. Member stands up to seek clarification for the benefit of the person on the Floor, Rule 80 of the Speaker\'s Rules provides that he may have the Floor if the hon. Member speaking consents. It was on the basis of Rule 80 that I sought the opinion of hon Kiliku and he accepted.\nMr. Shikuku: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Those rules talk of information, and the hon. Member on the Floor can give way to the hon. Member who wants to give the information. But when the hon. Member stood up he did not say what he was standing up on. The word "clarification" is very new to me.\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Thank you very much, Mr. Shikuku. I realise you have a very clear mind on these Rules. For the benefit of the House, I may as well read the wording of Rule 80 of the  Speakers\' Rules. It says:\n"A Member who is speaking may permit interaction by another Member who wishes to elucidate a point. Such Member will attempt to rise with the words "Will the hon. Member permit me...." or "Would the hon. Member kindly give way..." or "On a point of information...".\nThese are all variances. The Rule continues:\n"The Member then speaking will usually resume his seat while the interrupter asks for or gives explanation of the point. But if the hour is late or if the Member then speaking suspects the other of merely trying to harass him, he may indicate that he is not prepared to give way."\nI think the hon. Member was seeking for elucidation.\nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am talking about land as one of the factors of production because you cannot convince any investor to come to the country if there is no land available. That is the problem we are facing now.\nMr. Shikuku: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I thought what the hon. friend of mine wanted to do was to ask the hon. Member speaking about his statement to the effect that the land in Mombasa has been so grabbed, including graveyards. I thought I heard the hon. Member say so. Could he tell the House or substantiate which graveyard has been grabbed by the land grabbers?\nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Shikuku out of this House for five years and fortunately, I was already in the House and so my experience and his are almost the same.\nI am going to substantiate that statement. In Mikindani and Kwa Sheikh, there was land set aside for a graveyard, but the municipal council sold it. In my constituency in Vokoli and Port Reitz there was also land for a graveyard but it was also sold. If this is what has happened in my constituency, how about in other constituencies since mine is only one out of 188 constituencies? Even toilets are being sold. In Changamwe there is somebody who is paying rent for a toilet to the municipal council because he is sleeping in the toilet. Even the area meant for sewerage is being sold. I am very serious about this. They are taking everything. Even now they are blocking roads so that the land where the road passes can be sold. If this is what is happening where are we going to get land for public utility? In Mombasa, there is no land for schools because every piece of land has been sold. The Government is responsible for this because no individual people give land. It is the Commissioner for lands on behalf of the Government that is responsible for grabbing land in this country. In the future, we may not have schools or investors coming to the country because there is no land.\nMr. Shikuku: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am now getting enlighten on the fact that graveyards have been grabbed by this Government. I thought the hon. Member went further and talked about a sewerage. This is very interesting. This matter is very serious if land meant for sewerage, toilets, and roads reserved can be grabbed. Could the hon. Member go further and enlighten us on the seriousness of the issue? Which sewerage was grabbed?\nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would like to refer hon. Shikuku to the Town Clerk of Mombasa and ask him about the public toilets in Mombasa. They have all been closed. I am talking about those public toilet near Mabongo Health Centre which the outpatients used to use. They have been rented out and somebody is living there. Is it not the municipal council which has rented them out? Hon. Dr. Wameyo can confirm that somebody grabbed land in Kisauni. That is why I said I have gained a lot of experience.\nI support the Bill. The Bill is empowering the Minister to declare any place in this country to be an EPZ. We may have some people who may buy land from the individuals and prepare their cheques according to the standard set by EPZ. Therefore, if the Bill states that the Minister is empowered to declare any place an EPZ on the recommendation of the EPZ Authority, he should do so. The main problem is with our Ministers. This authority might end up making our Ministers looters. If the IPZ authority has recommended that somebody can invest anywhere why should he go to see the Minister?\nThe Assistant Minister for Energy (Mr. Nang\'ole): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Hon. Kiliku has imputed improper motives on Ministers by claiming that they are looters. Can he substantiate that?\nMr. Kiliku: The issue of Goldenberg is still fresh in our minds. Such powers cannot make sense. Why should one go to see the Minister when we want that money? We want to earn foreign exchange. Those are the draw backs of investment in this country. Why should one go to the Minister if there is an authority? This is an authority which has experienced, people who know what EPZ is. We want to get foreign exchange and investments to extend our economic growth in this country.', 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '6476266e-0b81-4d49-85ef-6e300e1cd84c', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:00.957431+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9712724089622498, 'non_english_score': 0.028727591037750244}
{'text': 'THE EXPORT PROCESSING ZONES (AMENDMENT) BILL II \nMr. Kiliku: I am supporting the Bill, but not the clause that states that once you are recommended by the EPZ you should go to see the Minister. There is no need for doing so. A Minister can attend the function as a ceremonial guest of honour. Those who have invested in EPZ are given the conditions that more than 60 per cent of products produced within the EPZ must be exported from this country to earn foreign exchange. We want to know from the Minister: What methodology he is going to use to ensure that this is applied. Is he going to know about it only through the customs officials? That is not enough. We do not want people affiliated to EPZ to go and manufacture products here or to use privileges provided only to use the same products for our domestic consumption. We need foreign exchange.\nWe want the Minister to give us the criteria which they are going to use to know whether this particular country has exported more than 60 per cent of the products to all these countries. The privileges given under EPZ on investment were passed here. I think this Government has already directed what should happen as far as investments are concerned and that is very good. You are given ten years grace before you can pay tax. We want to know if the EPZ are given freedom to bring their products here especially the raw materials, duty free. There must be a method to check whether what they are going to bring to this country as raw materials is duty free and if they are not going to sell the same products duty free to the domestic market. There must be a lot of corruption involved here. I am appealing to the Minister that anybody who is investing in EPZ should carry out a visibility study showing the amount of money involved in foreign exchange, the kind of business he is going to conduct and the number of employees he is going to employ from the labour market in Kenya.\nIn that feasibility study, the capital to be invested, the number of people to be employed, the number of expatriates to be involved and the labour requirements should be indicated. This is because one of the advantages that we are going to get by introducing EPZ is that investors will be encouraged to come and invest in our country, and also provide employment for Kenyans. Currently, we have many secondary school leavers and university graduates who have been *tarmacking> for the last five years or more.\nTherefore, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I appeal to the Government not to allow anybody to bring expatriates and give them jobs which can be managed by our people. We have qualified engineers and other necessary manpower required in this country. In fact, in my opinion, Kenya has some of the most educated people in the African continent today and, therefore, we should not just allow anybody to establish a factory in the EPZ without first producing a viable feasibility study and implementing it. The Government should be very careful on this matter and take into account the money to be involved; it should not be a matter of somebody with just $500 as initial capital being allowed by the Government. Of course, we have many willing investors, but the problem is the unavailability of land. That is the biggest problem we have and I would like the Government to accept the fact that there is no land for EPZ.\nMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the other problem we are having at present is that we have many taxes attached to the consumer goods. Today, because of the Value Added Tax, Sales Tax, Custom Duty and other taxes, that package of taxation has made consumer goods in this country very expensive. If we want more investors to come to this country, it would be better to waive some of the conditions which may work against the interests of the investors. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, another point which I would like to emphasise is that we want the investors in this country to be free from interference from whatever quarters. They should not be forced to take up partnerships with people they do not want. Let them appoint whoever they want. However, the truth of the matter is that the land for EPZ in Nairobi has been taken up by just a few go-downs; the whole land is owned by private people. Why is this so? There are only a few go-downs of some agencies, while the Government is making Sameer appear like a Prime Minister of this country. Even high ranking Government officials visit Sameer Industries! Why is it that only Sameer industries have been declared EPZ? The whole land from here to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport was meant to be an EPZ and the Government was to provide infrastructure in those areas, but now, only a few people who have constructed their go-downs there are the ones being referred to as EPZ. Why is this so and what about all the other land?\nMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, in Miritini, the Government was to use Ksh.500 million to develop a EPZ there. But the same piece of land which was declared an Export Processing Zone has been given to individuals. Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am sure you have visited Mombasa and seen a signpost which reads "Welcome to Mombasa", That area, which had been declared an EPZ, has been allocated to individuals now. I do not know how the Government is going to construct the go-downs there. In fact, the land has been allocated to foreigners; not local people. Hon. Mbela gave the land to councillors from Taita Taveta District, and the other land - more than 50 acres - was given to the Rwanda Government. But I understand that for the last five years, the Rwanda Government has not developed it. May be the Government officers may come in, but I warn them that I have already alerted the people there. If there is no development by the Rwanda Government or the EPZ, nobody else is going to be given that land, by hook or crook. This is because the land was taken from the local people - the squatters - and given out, and if the Rwanda Government is not going to develop that plot, I am going to tell the people to go onto that plot and build houses there. Let us meet there, on the plot! I am saying this because we have been misled. Five years ago, the land was taken away from the people who were crying and saying that no adjudication had been done and now, nothing is happening! I am going to tell the people to go onto that plot. You will call it incitement, but I will tell the people to do that, because we cannot tolerate such a thing. I know that some people are going to divide that land among themselves, because it was allocated to the Rwanda Government just as a cover-up; but there is nothing like Rwanda Government. Even if the land was allocated to the Rwanda Government, why could the people from whom it was taken not be compensated?\nMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we are experiencing problems of investment because of the corruption in the Government, in this and the last Government. The people in the Government have corrupted this country: they have perpetrated corruption so much that 80 per cent of the people in this country are the poorest. Furthermore, 30 per cent of those people are below the poverty line and all this has been brought about by corruption.\nAn hon. Member: Corruption <ea/>nini <ea/>wewe?\nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, they can say "corruption <ea/>nini", but a time will come when you will be asked many questions.\nMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, we have been told here that one person had run away with Ksh.600 million. The Government also accepted that there was money banked abroad, owned by brothers of this country - K 76 billion. Why should you go outside to borrow? Those people you are borrowing money from are the same people who are maintaining your accounts and they know you better than yourselves. They know what you are having in foreign accounts; they have the details. Some people are saying, "It is because of the Opposition". The Opposition is neither in power nor can it direct the investors not to come into this country. No way! They are chased away by corruption.\nAn hon. Member: The Opposition is not in power!\nMr. Kiliku: The Opposition is not in power, and to say that investors are being told by the Opposition not to invest in the country; and that it is the Opposition which is causing the clashes, as if we do not know about clashes, is very wrong.\nMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, anybody who is causing chaos in this country will be made to suffer for it, regardless of his/her position. I know about these clashes like "nobody\'s business" and I do not want anybody to mislead this House that it is the Opposition which is causing clashes. I have the details and the particulars of murderers in this country and we do not want the Opposition to be accused of causing insecurity in the country.\nMr. Deputy Speaker, you cannot believe that an ordinary Maasai or Kalenjin can start fighting without being protected by some powerful people. It is the leaders---\nThe Minister for Labour and Manpower Development (Mr. Masinde): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker.\nMr. Kiliku: Okay, murderer!\nThe Minister for Labour and Manpower Development (Mr. Masinde): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir the hon Member has stated that he has the particulars on murderers. I am wondering why he has not given those particulars to the appropriate authorities?\nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a Motion on the Order Paper next Tuesday, 9 November, 1993 on one of the murderers. There is also a report that I brought into this House that must be revisited. We will make sure that the report comes to this House. These are some of the people who caused clashes and who were quoted by the people as being the instigators of these clashes. These are the same people who are still continuing making inflammatory statements because there was no action that was taken against them in the first place. If you are one of those causing clashes, then you must know that you are scaring the investors away from this country. It is the same Kanu Government which is causing the clashes and then they say it is the Opposition that is doing so.\nMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, when tourists read about the Maasais fighting in Enoosupukia, they think that it is the Maasai Mara where they visit. One of the tourists was saying that there was fighting in Maasai Mara simply because they hear that there is fighting in Maasailand. It is the same Government which is causing all these problems in this country. What are we going to do? We are---\nThe Assistant Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Misoi): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the hon. Member to discuss matters that are not relevant to the topic under discussion?\nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am saying that since warriors, including Dr. Misoi, are the ones who are scaring away investors---\nThe Assistant Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Misoi): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for hon. Kiliku to call me a warrior instead of calling me an hon. MP for Eldoret South?\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Order! Order! All Members here are all hon. Members of this House. There are no warriors here. \nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Deputy Speaker, I did say that there are warriors in this country who have been scaring away tourists.', 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '8fc9a193-f7db-434b-a010-0b5e6298677f', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:00.958175+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9788066148757935, 'non_english_score': 0.021193385124206543}
{'text': '(Motion dropped)\nPROVISION OF FACILITIES TO SCHOOLS \nMr. Nthenge: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:-\nTHAT, while recognising the importance of the teaching profession in the country, and reiterating that teachers must be accorded the same facilities as the other public servants; this House calls on the Government to provide each school with:-\n(a) a staff room;\n(b) a reading, marking and drafting room\n(c) a telephone exchange\n(d) telephone booths within the school;\nand\n(e) visitors rooms where the public can meet individual teachers.\nThank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I have the pleasure to discuss a very important subject, that is the teaching profession. This profession is so important that it benefits everybody - parents, children and the nation. There is not a single person who is worth much, whether an hon. Member of Parliament, a medical officer or whatever it is, who has never been taught. Each of us has undergone training by teachers. Therefore, the teaching profession should be given very serious---\nQUORUM \nDr. Otieno-Kopiyo: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. There is no quorum in the house now. \nMr. Speaker: I agree with you, Dr. Kopiyo. Ring the Division Bell.\nWe now have a quorum, and you may proceed, Mr. Nthenge.\nMr. Nthenge: Mr. Speaker, Sir, teaching is a profession we all should respect because it is a profession we all owe something to. Because of that, you find that the profession must have human needs, and human behaviour is such that you would like to be like the others. We are social beings, and anybody who is a teacher is still a human being. The fact that he is a teacher does not make him an angel or anything different! He is a human being who has to live and do all the things that human beings do. They have also their private lives, and I feel it is necessary that we must accord them all the facilities that we accord all the other workers.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, one might wonder why I have put this Motion before the House and why I am discussing it. I am not professionally a teacher, but I went to school, I was taught and after leaving school, I have been serving in very many school Boards of Governors and I see the problems of teachers. Therefore, I feel that it is high time I talk for them because, as elected Members, one of our duties is to think of the others before we think of ourselves. We have got to do things for the people who cannot do them for themselves, and that is why we have the honour of being hon. Members. So, because I know teachers have these problems, I decided to bring this issue here for discussion with my colleagues, hon. Members. \nMr. Speaker, Sir, you find that, generally, teachers have only one room in a school, called "staff-room". The only teacher who has an advantage is the head-master, who has an office. Sometimes, the deputy head-teacher might have an office. Now, the ordinary teacher - and when I say "the ordinary teacher", I mean the teacher who is not the head-teacher or deputy head-teacher - has no office except a common room. It is where he has to do everything that a teacher should do such as marking and setting of examinations and preparation of work. Everything is done in that room, and it is where they are supposed also to be chatting. So, if the others are not busy and you are busy, you are very, very uncomfortably working. I am very glad that when I look around this House, I see a number of people who have been even teachers themselves, and even those who have qualification of the teaching profession. I am talking, not because I am a teacher and it affects me; it has never affected me. I only taught as an untrained teacher for less than five months. So, I happen not to think of myself as such. In any case, I am too old now to be a teacher anyway, but I am worried about the young ladies and gentlemen who are in the profession or who want to join the profession. Personally, when I was a student, I wanted very much to become a teacher, but I did not like the conditions of teaching. Therefore, I would like them improved for the sake of those who feel like me. They want to be teachers, but they want also to be treated like the other human beings or the other workers. When I say "ordinary teachers", do not forget that there are teachers with three university degrees, like Dr. Onyonka. He is a teacher and the fact that he is very learned does not preclude him from being an ordinary teacher - he is a teacher! Then from there, you come to those teachers who have Masters degrees, Bachelors degrees, Diplomas and so on. Therefore, the teaching profession starts from a professor down to the nursery school teacher, and these people have the right to live like all the other workers. Why should a District Officer enjoy a lot of privileges just because he has a Bachelor of Arts degree?\nQUORUM \nDr. Otieno-Kopiyo: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. There is no quorum again.\nMr. Speaker: No, we do not have a quorum again. Ring the Division Bell.\nMr. Speaker: We now again have a quorum. Proceed, Mr. Nthenge.\nMr. Nthenge: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was saying that teachers should not be subjected to conditions which are not conducive to the provision of standard education. They should be accorded the treatment that other employees are being accorded. I have said that teachers in most schools have only one room to share among themselves and that they do not have facilities like the other workers have. Whether you are a policeman, once you are a police officer, you are given an office and a telephone. Once you are a District Officer, you have your own office, a telephone and even a messenger. But you find a teacher who has, for example, three degrees, two degrees, one degree, a diploma or a certificate of teaching being treated below the standard of a guy who did not fair so well in Form Four examination. Just because this person goes to work in a company or in the Civil Service, he is treated better than the teacher. So, the teacher starts wondering, "What is wrong with me? Am I in the wrong profession? Am I in the suffering profession such that I keep on suffering, and for how long shall I suffer."\nMr. Speaker, Sir, that leads me to say that that is why a number of very good teachers, after teaching for a while, they decide to leave the teaching profession, because they are as qualified as others. They go and get jobs in banks, government institutions and so on, because they are very marketable. Then I ask the question: "Is he or she going to do a better job for the nation than teaching?" The answer is definitely, no. But because the conditions are so bad, you cannot blame the officer because that officer is a human being, just like the other human being who have got so many privileges as workers. The teacher is taken to be a person who has to sacrifice. "Why should we over-sacrifice, as teachers?", they ask. And I think they are right. Why should they over-sacrifice? If I were in their position, I would definitely look for another job!\nMr. Speaker, Sir, at Independence, almost all the lady teachers decided to go and do secretarial job, which required only nine months of training, and they got better salaries and facilities. The teaching profession was left with a big problem and we had to employ very many untrained teachers. Why? Because they had run away to better situations. I can even quote one of them who is an hon. Member here, the hon. Phoebe Asiyo. She went and became a senior officer in the Prisons Department, because teachers are treated very lowly. In the Prisons Department, she was such a senior officer. She used the same qualifications and ability, and she proved she was worth the job. But she had to leave the class-room, like many others, because teachers are given very low and poor treatment. They are not considered! Do you know where they can complain? They can only complain to the children they teach, because they are not in touch with the employer, as it were. This is because when you are in a school, the only people you see are the teachers and the pupils or the students. So, you can complain to nobody!\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I think there is a message in trade unionism for the teachers, because teachers seem to lack that. They are trained in everything else except that. They are supposed to be some kind of angels. I hope that hon. Komora will get a chance to tell us something about teachers since he has experience in the field. I don\'t think it is fair to ask teachers to sacrifice all the time and other people do not sacrifice. The police officers do not sacrifice, neither do the district officers or others. If anything they travel by Land Rovers and other models of vehicles. The teacher is only given a piece of chalk yet he is doing the most important job to make the nation what it is.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I feel very disappointed when I see that teachers do not have offices. This Motion calls for teachers to be given offices instead of staff rooms. They should also have another quiet room where they can do marking of exercises, and prepare lessons. That room should have an *inducive> working atmosphere. It is not normal to work when people are talking next to you. After the teacher has finished his preparation he can go back to the staff-room and join the other teachers. They should have a quiet place that they can use. We are not giving teachers a fair deal. They are over-sacrificing. I want them to have a quiet room for marking, preparations and writing whatever they have to write.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, if you look at most schools, even big schools like Pangani Girls and Nairobi School you find that the telephone facilities are only for the headmistress and the secretaries.\nQUORUM \nProf. Ouma: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Once again is there a quorum in the House?\nMr. Speaker: No, we do not have a quorum. Ring the Division Bell.\nMr. Speaker: We have a quorum now. You may proceed, Mr. Nthenge.\nMr. Nthenge: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that telephone facilities do not exist for teachers in most of the schools except for the headmasters` use when in other offices the secretaries have telephone facilities! If you are a teacher and you have a problem, whereby you would like to communicate with your spouse you cannot telephone her because you do not have telephone facilities. If you have forgotten something in your house you cannot make a telephone call unless you go and beg the headmaster and if he offers you the facility he has to hear what you are saying to your husband "Darling, I left my money". Who wants to be overheard? Everybody would like to make a telephone call in privacy.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I am saying that every teacher should be accorded telephone facilities because it is cheaper to use telephones to relay messages than to drive out of the school compound or to catch buses because a good number of them do not have cars. I wonder whether they even have loan facilities to buy cars. Teachers are not well treated. There are many university lecturers who have left teaching because they live under very difficult conditions.', 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '26d4af3e-f7bb-44cb-bebf-f53e3443eeba', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:00.959055+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9809771180152893, 'non_english_score': 0.019022881984710693}
{'text': '(Motion)\nINFRASTRUCTURES FOR MUNICIPALITIES \nMr. Mak\'Onyango: Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion.\nThat, while appreciating the Government\'s move in upgrading Siaya and other urban centres into Municipalities, and given the crucial role local authorities play in the social, economic and political development of a country; this House calls upon the Government to immediately put in place a special programme to finance such infrastructure as adequate water supply, industries, roads and commercial enterprises within these centres to facilitate their systematic development.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, the mere move by the Government in upgrading some of the town centres in this country to municipalities implies that the Government recognises these particular centres as focal points for development. It has been necessary for me to bring this Motion because in this country we have a number of centres which have been classified as municipalities, and as I have indicated in the terms of the Motion, Siaya is one of them. Other such centres include Busia in Western  Province, Kitui in Eastern Province---\nQUORUM \nMr. Magwaga: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.\nMr. Speaker: What is your point of order?\nMr. Magwaga: There is a problem of Quorum, Mr. Speaker, Sir.\nMr. Speaker: Do we have too much of it?\nMr. Magwaga: We are less than 30!\nMr. Speaker: You mean we have no Quorum?\nMr. Magwaga: Yes!\nMr. Speaker: Can you find out whether there is a Quorum, including the Member who is Moving the Motion? Well, I am informed that we have no quorum. Can the Division Bell be rung?\nMr. Speaker: Now we have a quorum. Continue Mr. Mak\'Onyango.\nMr. Mak\'Onyango: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was saying that the mere fact that the Government has so identified a number of these centres as municipalities, leaves it in our minds, that the Government is satisfied that these centres qualify to act as focal points for development. I have said that among these centres, are Siaya and Homa-Bay in Nyanza Province. We also have Busia in Western Province, Tharaka-Nithi and Kitui in Eastern Province and Voi down at the Coast, among others.\nMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, what baffles me is that although these centres are so recognised as focal points for systematic development, nothing seems to have been done to justify these particular status accorded to these particular centres. Before we continue, it is perhaps wise that one takes a close look at what is meant by a municipality. A municipality implies that in that centre, there is a local authority with a high degree of self-government. In this regard, self-government applies more to economic viability or well-being than political well-being.\nMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is sad to note that many of these so-called municipalities appear to me to be more of political municipalities than economic municipalities. What we need are economic and not political municipalities. I call them political because it would seem as if somebody simply dreamt of rewarding certain people for certain good deeds and he thought the best reward was to appoint an area such a person came from as a municipality. To me, that way of going about so crucial a matter is a misnomer and should be avoided. I would like to see a situation in which any centre, recognized as a municipality has the necessary economic back-up. In case that does not exist, I would like to see a situation where-by the mere act of making a place a municipality, the Government should go out of its way and initiate such projects as would be able to give these centres the necessary economic back-up or the necessary economic strength.\nMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me take Siaya as an example. Siaya is called a municipal council but does not have the means to sustain itself. It relies almost exclusively on the Government or the Ministry of Local Government for everything that it has to do. The very essence of a municipality which is self-governing does not exist. What exists there is a kind of political set-up that is not backed by economic resources. I do think that in order for us to be able to justify the calling of any centre a municipality, the Government should establish the necessary infrastructure.\nAs I speak here, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, Siaya is a municipality without adequate water supply. There is no way any industrialist is ever going to move to a place like Siaya which has no water supply. I think the Government has the resources to enable it to ensure that all local authorities have the necessary infrastructures. This is because there is need to establish industries in various towns so as to give these local authorities a reliable source of income. It would be sad to elevate towns to municipalities and then do nothing else in terms of assisting them financially. I therefore urge, through this Motion, that the necessary infrastructures should be provided in these areas. The Government should go out of its way and ensure that each municipality in this country has a reliable water supply because that will attract investors and industrialists to such towns.\nMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Government should also go out of its way and ensure that industries are established in local authorities. We do know for sure that the Government has the means to direct certain industries to certain places. I am reminded of sometime back when almost every industry that was being started to this country was taken to Thika. This was by way of design. I am also reminded of a similar situation that has existed elsewhere. So, I am more than convinced that the same can be done with all these other municipalities. Deliberate efforts should be made to direct certain industries to some of these places so that these places can become the focus of development. So, I urge the Government to do out of its way and see to it that there is some measure of industrialisation in very urban centre that has acquired the status of a municipality. That is one way of ensuring that local authorities do achieve a reasonable measure of financial viability. This is because through these industries they will be able to at least generate a certain measure of income which they cannot raise now.\nMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, we do feel that in order for a town to justify being called a municipality, it must have a reliable source of income. Many of the recently established municipalities like Siaya, Busia, Homa Bay, Tharaka Nithi, Kitui and Voi--\nQUORUM \nProf. Ouma: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. I feel very sad that I have to interrupt my colleague, hon. Mak\'Onyango, who is talking on this very important topic of urban development but he cannot address a House which has no quorum.\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wetangula): Yes, we have no quorum. Ring the Bell.\nWe have a quorum now. Carry on, Mr. Mak`Onyango.\nMr. Mak\'Onyango: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is sad that the Minister for Local Government, who should be here to listen to some of these sentiments, is not present.\nAs I was saying, in order to make some of these recently created municipalities effective, I would urge for the amendment of the Local Government Act to strengthen all these municipalities. The need to do this arises out of the importance of making local authorities self-reliant to enable them to generate sufficient funds to be able to render the required services to the people. It is also necessary to amend the Local Government Act so that the decision-making process can be taken back to where it belongs. We are now in a multi-party era in this country. That necessarily means that the people must participate as much as possible in the governance of their own areas. That can only be realised through local authorities. So, it is necessary to amend the Local Government Act to give local authorities more power so that they have more say in the running of their affairs. We should not continue to have the present situation whereby the local authorities have to rely on the Minister for Local Government in order to discharge their responsibilities. This taking away of power from local authorities is, to a large extent, responsible for the corruption and inefficiency within the local authorities.\nMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, as has been observed time and again, the biggest problem facing our local authorities is corruption. What is the root cause of this corruption? That corruption comes about because the Chief Officers of these local authorities are imposed on the local authorities. Rather than letting the local authorities have a say in the appointment of such officers, we have a situation whereby we have people from other parts of the country being sent to run local authorities in other places. We also have a situation whereby---\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Wetangula): Order! Your time is over!\nMr. Mak\'Onyango: With those few remarks, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to move and call upon hon. Obwocha to second the Motion.\nMr. Obwocha: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to second this very important Motion. I wish to make a few comments on what is happening in local authorities including services that we expect to be provided. It is very sad for the Government to upgrade urban centres without taking into account economic considerations.\nMost of the urban centres that have been upgraded in the past were done haphazardly and this is a very sad situation. Towns like Siaya and Nyamira which were upgraded recently, have been financed through, say, cess from tea, coffee, pyrethrum and so on. Instead of this money being channelled to the town councils for provision of services to the <ea/>wananchi, this money is being administered by the district commissioners. This is an extremely bad situation which should be corrected if we require and expect these councils to operate properly.\nWe wonder what the Ministry is up to when it gives a town council or a municipality higher status and yet it does not even send a physical planner there. I have in mind Myamira Town which was upgraded because of the new district and yet it does not have a physical planner. How does the Ministry expect the roads to be nurtured in the towns? How do we expect the towns to grow properly. Some of people have build where roads are supposed to be constructed. This is a very sad affair.\nFord Kenya stands for the strengthening of local authorities. When we strengthen local authorities, we do not have <ea/>majimbo in mind. It is a very sad affair when Ministers in Government who have taken oath to defend a unitary state of this country to go around asking for "mini-states" in Kenya. We, the young generation of politicians who are coming up, feel very sorry for these people. I hear the hon. Lotodo saying that he wants his own territory to look after his goats and cattle!\nWhat we ask for is a special programme to finance facilities, infrastructure, water supply, industries, roads and so on in these towns, we are not asking for Government officers and other people who want to grab plots in towns. When Ford Kenya takes over this Government, there will be no Government houses for Government officers because houses and plots have been allocated illegally; they have been grabbed by Government officers. It is very bad when people grab land and plots where Government houses are standing. After grabbing the plots, the officers move and start claiming owner-occupied allowances. This is misuse of public funds.\nWe know there are indigenous banks in this country that have collapsed. The African entrepreneur has not been given his chance and we are now depending on foreign banks in this country.', 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '0aa72adc-58aa-41a3-afb7-4f51f9a89538', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:00.959926+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9705232381820679, 'non_english_score': 0.02947676181793213}
{'text': "(Motion)\nINFRASTRUCTURES FOR MUNICIPALITIES \nMr. Kirwa: Thank you, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving this opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion. While doing that I wish to say there are various aspects which we need to look into, as far as urban development is concerned. One of the issues which is of major concern to this nation is water treatment. Many towns, even developed ones like Kitale, and many urban centres have the problem of water treatment. Water treatment has been lacking in some towns to the extent that there is s serious outbreak of typhoid and other water-borne diseases in may towns. We are urging the Ministry of Local Government to as much as possible try to facilitate water treatment plants in various towns. While considering water it is also important for this Ministry to also consider seriously situations of water projects. I have in mind the water plans that we have in Trans Nzoia, the Nzoia Water Project. This project was poorly planned and for the last five years it has been suffering a lot from siltation and other components which were supposed to be included in the initial design.\nIt is also important for the Ministry to consider small centres such as the one in question as far as sanitation is concerned. Not many of these urban centres are planned and there are sprawling settlements around the towns. A lot of people build their houses in places without taking into account provision for sewerage system. It is important that even if a small trading area has been upgraded to the status of either an urban centre or a municipality there ought to be a master plan from the beginning of the particular town, and no building should be set until it has been approved by the various local authorities. While that is supposed to be the position for the last five years much of the development in some of the small trading centres has been by individuals and there has not been serious consideration of how the long-term development of the area is supposed to be. What makes the situation worse is the fact that such individuals get letters of approval from health inspectors and other local authorities` officers to put up a building that is going to be demolished later. That is a serious matter that we need to consider.\nThe other issue that we need to look into is that of condemned house, more so in Nairobi. It has become a habit - and this has been an audit query for the last five years - that some officers, including Permanent Secretaries and even some hon. colleagues here, get houses condemned. In some cases houses are condemned even before a board of survey is convened. Thereafter the an occupant moves into the house, uses some little money to renovate the same house and goes ahead to draw allowance from the Government on that particular house. This is a sorry state of affairs that we need to discourage as much as possible.\nWe also need to look at the road network in various towns. The services charge money that has been collected since the inception of this project has never been used to the satisfaction of areas` residents. For example, Kitale is full of potholes and the Ministry Local Government owes Kitale Municipality more than shs28 million. We do not know what the Ministry is thinking about. It ought to release the money it owes to various municipalities to enable the municipalities to make proper utilisation of it. It may not be possible for the Government to implement this Motion immediately. But I think it can try to set up a programme that is going to channel some of the money to develop areas like the ones cited by the Mover in this particular Motion.\nMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is also important to realise that for any development to take place we need a good atmosphere, peace, tranquillity and cordial CO-existence of all tribes in this nation. It is disturbing that we residents of Trans Nzoia have in a bad situation because we have been under serious threats all the time. The Government ought to issue a statement in respect of various threats issued by leaders, particularly Ministers. While we have no over movement and settlement of the people of this nation I am seriously concerned about the security of my constituents. Some members of various communities have farms in West Pokot, Saboti and Cherangany Constituency. Now, some of the people who have been displaced from West Pokot have moved to Cherangany to settle on their own plots. It was saddening to hear some leaders saying that if we are not flushed out some who have taken refuge in Cherangany they will claim part of Trans Nzoia District. This is a very sad state of affairs. When we say these things it is because we want peace; for the development plans we are talking about here to be implemented there must be total peace. When such threats are issued by Ministers then we have no alternative but to defend our people.\nIt is not enough to be a Member of Parliament. It is important for Ministers to realise that we are Members of Parliament because we represent people; we are not Members of Parliament in a vacuum. The Minister ought to consider this issue and the Government ought also to take a stand on this particular issue. I am saying this because it is really saddening for my area to be under serious threat from leaders who are members of the Government. The same goes for the issue of <ea/>majimbo; it is no longer important to discuss the issue of <ea/>majimbo as such. We should be told what the basic ingredients of <ea/>majimbo are. <ea/>Majimbo in a cocoon does not allow us to understand what it is all about. None of us is scared of anything as long as it is well explained. But if some of the issues about it are not explained it will be dangerous for Kenya. We cannot deal with a monster we have not been made to understand. Those who are preaching <ea/>majimbo should tell us what it is all about. What do they want from this <ea/>majimbo which they are talking about? What are they scared of? It has reached a stage we have to speak our minds. Why are people scared of the Kikuyu? We are making the Kikuyu a very important community by being scared of them. The Kikuyu are no different from other Kenyans. If they are involved in a political issue we can deal with them politically in the same way we deal with other Kenyans in political issues. But when we get scared of them all the time we are making them united and look impossible in Kenya, which is not the case.\nMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am saying these things because I have been keeping quiet for the last nine months and my constituents are concerned because they cannot understand why I am keeping quiet in the wake of things that are not genuine for this nation.\nWith those remarks, I beg to support.\nMr. Mutere: Thank you so much, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, for giving me this opportunity to make a contribution to this very important Motion.\nIn supporting this Motion, I would like to come to the core of the Motion itself and that is finance. The present finance system, as far as the local authorities are concerned is very inadequate because most of the financing support has to get Ministerial approval and many times when some of the local authorities request for this approval they never get it on time. It is important that the local authorities are given a free hand to be able to go shopping even if need be internationally, for money for some of the projects that they deem fit for their own municipalities. As far as Siaya is concerned which is an upcoming municipality, there is a need that apart from what one hon. Member has raised, to develop even the health facilities, the housing facilities and even the power facilities within the municipality. For the young municipalities to be able to do this, they need adequate finances and they can only do it if they have a free hand to be able to prioritise some of the items that they feel are important for their needs.\nWhile talking on the infrastructure, I would also like you to know that in places like Makadara Constituency which I represent, we have a very serious problem as far as the upgrading of the slums is concerned. This is the problem that the City Council has been addressing itself to but we have not had co-operation as far as the central Government is concerned because we need some of this land to be transferred to the people so that we can come up with the upgrading programmes. It is important for an institute like the City Council which has been in existence for years to be given a free hand to be able to upgrade some of these places. I am referring to places like Mukuru, Kaiyaba and Lungalunga. If you go there you wonder whether you are actually in Nairobi; you think that you are in a different place and yet this is part and parcel of the city under the sun. If you visit the area you really wonder whether you are in the city under the sun.\nIt is important that we do co-ordinate these activities, so that the <ea/>wananchi's plight is improved. After thirty years of Independence when you see some of the things that are still in existence you really wonder whether this Independence has really been beneficial to some of our people. We as leaders ought to work together so that we forget about parties. Our objective should be to serve the people of this nation and not divide them along the party lines.\nTalking about some of the problems of the upcoming municipalities, education is one of them. We do know that some of these areas do have primary schools. I am also concerned about some places like my area. Some of the wards do not have secondary schools. We would like to be given an opportunity to be able to go looking for funds and be given Government land to be able to construct secondary schools. It will be an ideal situation where each would have a fully fledged educational system right from the nursery, primary and secondary level so that the students or the pupils would only leave the wards when they go to the university level. At slightly lower level of education, this could be done at the municipal level. I would like to appeal to the Minister concerned that they should consider seriously about letting the local authorities to have a free hand in getting funds to finance some of these facilities.\nTalking about <ea/>majimboism, I think it is proper for some of us to air our views on it. One wonders whether we are applying double standards within our policies because here we are going out signing treaties with the East African community, signing treaties with KOMESA and back home we are divided. These stands are irreconcilable. We should have a definite straightforward policy whereby some of these could be put right, but we are doing the right thing at the wrong time. I do not think that this is the time we should be talking about <ea/>majimboism instead we should be talking about the unification not only of Kenya, but of the East Africa, Southern Africa and the whole continent for that matter. The World is coming to a new international world order; it is becoming a small village.\nLooking at Africa from the international perspective, it becomes one of the many villages. If the whole of Africa becomes a village and we are talking about dividing Mombasa or some other places, one wonders on what level we are thinking and how serious one is in focusing his mind in as far as development is concerned.", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '69bbd23d-e7df-4f3f-89a2-49aa06eb4217', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:00.960856+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9788098335266113, 'non_english_score': 0.021190166473388672}
{'text': 'MOTIONS\nREVISION OF WAGE GUIDELINES\nMr. Anyona: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:-\nTHAT, in view of the recent economic changes which have affected prices of basic consumer goods, services and rents, and in view of the effects of liberalization process of the economy, this House resolves that:-\n(a) the machinery for the revision of salaries, wages and other employment benefits for all workers be set in motion with a view to having adjustments made to compensate the workers for the rise in the cost of living;\n(b) the wage guidelines be revised; and\n(c) the deregistration of the Kenya Union of Civil Servants (K.U.C.S) and the University Staff Union (USU) be revised with a view to having the unions reinstated.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin by pointing out that the workers of this nation played a very vital role in the process of decolonization. It will be remembered that it was the workers and their leaders who were in the forefront in the struggle for Independence when the political leaders were either in prison or were not allowed to organize anything along political lines.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, usually, the role of workers in the economy is very central. It is the workers who produce the wealth of this nation. The workers of this nation work very hard for long hours, and yet, I do not think they are adequately compensated for the hard work they do for this nation. It is well known that the economy has largely been in the hands of foreigners who have not taken very serious interest in the plight of the workers in this country. In this era of multi-party democracy, it must be one of the basic roles of Parliament to ensure that workers are adequately compensated and provided with the necessary facilities to make their working conditions better than they are at the moment.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, the liberalization process of the economy has very serious effect on the welfare of workers. The structural adjustment policies that have been imposed by the World Bank and the I.M.F, have not been clearly made known to the thousand workers of this nation and it is unfortunate that the Government has not come out clearly to say what they intend to do about the plight of workers in this country. It is believed that the Government is intending to retrench the Civil Service but we have not been told clearly what modalities are going to be put in place and what considerations are going to be made in this respect. So, we have to be extremely careful as a Parliament about these policies to ensure that our workers do not, as a result, suffer for no fault of their own. \nMr. Speaker, Sir, the liberalization of the economy has set in motion a very high rate of inflation. The prices of all basic commodities like sugar, maize, meal, bread, and milk have soared. The house rents and transportation charges have also soared. If you look around town in the morning and afternoon, you would find that almost the entire population of this town walk to and from their places of work. This is because they are not able to afford the cost of transportation. They cannot afford the <ea/>Matatu and Bus fares, so they can only walk to work.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, the whole principle of Independence was to improve the welfare and the living standards of the people. If people who, several years ago, could afford Bus fare, can no longer afford the same today, this means that the workers are worse off than they have been before and we, as a country and a Government, therefore, cannot feel very proud of that kind of development.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, the structural adjustment programme has a very serious social and political effect on the workers. We know of cases in other countries where workers have had to take to the streets---\nMr. Kiliku: On a point of order Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Minister for Labour and Manpower Development has deliberately decided not to attend the proceedings of this House today.\nMr. Speaker: Order Mr. Kiliku! I think we do have the Assistant Minister present in the House.\nMr. Anyona: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister had the courtesy of informing me earlier that he was responding to the Motion but hon. Kiliku is quite right in expressing his concern about the Minister\'s absence from the House. He should be here to hear what is being said.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, we as a country and as a Government ought to be very proud of the workers. This is so because although they have suffered for along time, they have not done what workers in other countries have done. They have not taken to the streets to demonstrate over prices of food and so on. As we were saying last time, it would be dangerous for the Government and for us as a country, to take that goodwill on part of the workers in this country for granted. I am saying this because, if the workers are pushed to the limit, then clearly, we would be faced with the kind of chaos that has taken place in other countries. Therefore, this Parliament must be very much concerned about the level of salaries, wages, and services that are given to the workers in this country.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, when we talk about raising the salaries of the workers - and we had this argument the other day - my argument is that even raising workers salaries by 100 per cent, might not be good enough. What should be done, as far as we are concerned, is to ensure that the workers receive salaries that are in line with their productivity. What tends to happen is that even where companies are making a lot of profit, the workers are underpaid. We must be concerned to ensure that small enterprises do not collapse because of wages that are not in line with their level of production. But, in majority of cases, the employers can pay higher salaries or give better wages and benefits to their workers. However, that does not happen simply because I think we as Government and a as Parliament, have not given our workers adequate support.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, on the rents of houses in this city and elsewhere in the country, you can hardly find a place where one small cost less than Kshs.1,000/=. What is the salary of an ordinary worker in this country? Kshs.1,500 is considered a very high salary and yet Kshs.1,000/= goes to rent and one really wonder what is left to the worker for his livelihood. What we are saying is that it is not realistic to say that: "let us have 100 per cent salary increase". What we are saying is that workers must be paid in accordance with what they produce. The employers should not enjoy super profits when the workers are suffering.\nToday, workers of this nation, do not enjoy any employment benefits like free medical treatment as it used to be the case in the past. If you went to the private companies, you would find that they have stopped all these things so that workers are unable now to get medical services. When workers go to government hospitals, they are required to pay but they do not have the money. This country as I have said, has retrogressed instead of progressing in terms of the improvement of the welfare of the people.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, dealing with the question of the wage guidelines, I consider them to be a conspiracy between the Government and the employer. This is so because we believe in bargaining and since people should bargain on what is available I do not know what interest Government has in limiting the workers\' bargaining power to get the best benefits they can get from the employer? What is even worse is that we have gone to an extent of curtailing the freedom of the worker by refusing him the right to strike. I would like to hear from the Minister for Labour and Manpower Development why they believe that wage guidelines are necessary particularly in the process of liberalization. How can you liberalize other aspects of economy to allow the manufactures and others to raise prices and yet you do not allow the workers to bargain for the best position that they can get from the employer? If they are not abolished then the Ministry must put a very good case otherwise it is this kind of thing that creates industrial unrest. We must make employers in this nation, be they Kenyans or foreigners, to understand that they have to contend with the workers. They cannot expect the Government to protect them against our own workers.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, as I was saying we would like the wage guidelines to be revised but we would, in fact like them to be totally abolished, unless there is good explanation on why they should be maintained. I am made to understand that those wage guidelines are the arguments of the Treasury. I do not know the link between the Treasury and the Ministry of Labour and Manpower Development in this respect, because the Treasury has its own consideration for regulating the economy. But the Ministry of Labour and Manpower Development was set up to ensure that workers are protected and in this case, the Ministry of Labour and Manpower Development is merely used by the Treasury as a tool to curtail the freedom and rights of workers to bargain for the best working conditions that they can obtain.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, it is very surprising that there appears to be no bargaining between the unions and employers going on. There was a lot of agitation for increase of salaries but everything seems to have died. I would like to hear from the Government what is going on. We did hear the Ministry saying that unions should start negotiations with their employers but nothing seems to be happening. The workers seem to have been lost because the labour union movement is also in a mess. I will speak on it later.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, the trade unions have the freedom of association under the Constitution. It is, therefore, not right for the Government or anybody else to create bottlenecks in that process. Many a time, when workers are trying to negotiate with their employers and the employers become difficult for one reason or another, mainly because they enjoy the patronage of the Government which protects them, they do not listen to the workers. When the workers fail to fit in then immediately the Police are called. This is an infringement of the freedom or the Constitutional right of workers to bargain with the employer and if the employer does not respond to the employee\'s demand, then the workers have the right of withdrawal of labour.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to come to the question of the de-registration of the Kenya Union of Civil Servants (K.U.C.S) and the University Staff Union (U.S.U). There has never really been any good reason for the de-registration of these two unions. We would like the Government, particularly now, to be in the forefront in the protection of the rights of our people. When the Government, which is the biggest employer, denies its own workers the right of representation then I do not know what is expected of the rest of the employers who may not necessarily care for the welfare of our workers.', 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd3cc3a63-ed7a-4ff3-b49d-4839e5832346', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:00.961641+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9804611206054688, 'non_english_score': 0.01953887939453125}
{'text': 'MOTIONS\nAMENDMENT TO THE LIQUOR ACT \nTHAT, in view of the economic problems faced by the subsistence farmers in rural areas who rely heavily on crops such as millet, sorghum, and coconut for making local brew such as <ea/>busaa and palm wine to earn a living, and taking into account that brewing of traditional liquor is prohibited while its consumption is not; this House urges the Government:-\n(a)\tto lift the ban on traditional liquor brewing, and\n(b)\tto amend the Traditional Liquor Licensing Act to allow small scale breweries as well as home brewing for domestic consumption.\nMr.Speaker: Order, I think hon. Anyona was continuing.\nMr.Anyona: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when the House rose last time, I was seconding this Motion and I had covered the question of manufacture of traditional liquor.\nMr.Speaker, Sir, I was going on to say that the consumption of traditional liquor does not require any licence, but manufacture for sale requires licensing under Section 7 of the Traditional Liquor Act, Cap.122. The appropriate licences are provided for under the schedule from L1 to L7.\nMr.Speaker: Order! Order! As the hon. Anyona has the Floor, the hon. Ndotto over there has the Floor illegally. Also, Members withdrawing from the Chamber are doing so in a fashion that is disrupting the proceedings of the House.\nShall all the Members who wish to withdraw from the House proceed to do so with due honour? All those other Members who wish to remain should take their seats.\nProceed Mr. Anyona.\nMr.Anyona: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Section 8 of the Act provides for the manner in which application may be made for the manufacture of traditional liquor for sale. What we are saying is that if traditional liquor was prohibited, you would not then require to apply for a licence to manufacture it for sale because that would be prohibited.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, section 15 of the Act provides for a temporary licence, whereby one can brew traditional liquor for sale under temporary circumstances. Section 25 of the Act provides for the offences that are committed under the law. In that section, it is an offence for any person not being the holder of an appropriate or temporary licence to manufacture for sale, or to have in his possession for sale any traditional liquor. If you manufacture for sale, or you sell, or you are in possession and are intending to sell without a licence, then that is an offence and not otherwise.\nSection 25, Sub-section 2, provides that if you advertise that you have a licence to sell and yet you do not, then that is an offence. Section 25, Sub-section 3, provides that if you manufacture excessive quantity, more than you need for consumption, then that also is an offence.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, Section 31, Sub-section 1, states very clearly that it is only an offence if the person has any traditional liquor upon any premises of his in a quantity greater than might be reasonably required for consumption by himself or his family.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, it is very clear that you do not need any licence when you manufacture or brew traditional liquor for consumption. However, we have very peculiar circumstances where the police go and arrest people, claiming that they were brewing and consuming traditional liquor contrary to the law. In my constituency there was a recent case where the Administration Police arrested four people and charged them under this section. I want hon. Sunkuli to pay attention to what I am saying. In court, these people were charged under Cap. 125 and yet the Traditional Liquor Licensing Act is Section 122. The particular case I am refereeing(sic) to is criminal case No.785 of 1993 at Nyamira District Magistrate\'s Court. That tells you how absurd the law is.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to touch on the enforcement of the law---\nMr. Speaker, Sir, the consultations are very loud and I cannot understand why Members are not interested in this matter where members of the public are being harassed.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, Section 30, sub-section 1, which provides for enforcement of the Act, reads as follows:\n"Any administrative officer, any police officer above the rank of inspector and any other police officer having written authority from a magistrate, may enter upon and search any premises at any time when he has reasonable grounds to believe that traditional liquor is being manufactured..."\nMr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Anyona. I will now propose the Question.\nThe Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr. Osogo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, thank you for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this very important Motion. If it did not have drafting faults, I would have supported it to the hilt. It is a very important Motion to some of us, and I would have supported it. However, it has drafting faults and that is why I reserve my support.\nThe drafting faults have been indicated by the Seconder of the Motion, in that the Motion is requesting for the amendment of the Traditional Liquor Licensing Act, Cap.122 and part (b) of the Motion is superfluous in that it is requesting that the Traditional Liquor Licensing Act be amended to allow small-scale brewers as well as home brewing. As you have heard from the Seconder of the Motion, these two are provided for in the existing Act and that is why I say that the two are superfluous.\nIn fact I had the opportunity of pointing out to the hon. Mover of the Motion that there will be difficulties in supporting the Motion, particularly by Members on this side of the House, who really want the brewing of traditional liquor to be uniform. We know that there are some parts of the country where it is allowed and not others. I was definitely going to support it if it did not have part (b) in it.\nMr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would have thought, and I am not allowed to amend it, that the Motion would have stopped at part (a) with a small addition at the end, after removing the word \'and\', of the words \'in selected areas\'. It should have read "to lift the ban on traditional liquor brewing in selected areas".\nWhy am I saying in selected areas? All of us know how the ban came to be imposed on this traditional liquor. Some of us also who have worked in various parts of Kenya know how the ban came about. When traditional brew had not been banned, we used to see people in some communities who used to sell their cattle and <ea/>shambas to get money to buy traditional liquor. We know that that was one of the causes why the ban on traditional liquor was enforced. In some areas the ban should not have been enforced.\nThe Mover might ask why I said that part "b" of the Motion is unnecessary. If we look into the existing Act, Schedule 1, you will find that if one wants to get a licence to brewing traditional liquor, one is required to fill in Form PL3. If one wants to brew liquor on a small scale, one is also required to fill in Form PL5, Schedule 1. I do not know what the reaction of the Government is going to be, but I had reasons for supporting the Motion if it did not have faults in drafting.\nI was educated with money raised from traditional liquor brewed by my mother. My elder brother and I would not have been able to get education if my mother had not brewed traditional liquor for commercial purposes. If it was not there, today I would not have been standing in this House.\nI know that in Nairobi, people brew this local liquor. If you go to Kibera and Kariobangi on Saturdays, you will find people drinking this traditional brew. Why then can people in Bunyala not drink it? I know for certain that in parts of Machakos this traditional liquor has been officially allowed. So, I am pleading that people in Bunyala be allowed to brew this liquor. That is why I think a reasonable hon. Member from the Opposition should have amended the Motion to read "in selected areas" just as Nairobi and Machakos are selected areas.\nMy constituents are fishermen and fishing is just the same as mining gold. The miner goes underground very unsure of whether he will come back alive or dead. So, when a fisherman goes to fish he does not know whether he will come out alive or dead. When he comes out, he is very tired from fishing---\nMr. Ndetei: On a point of order, Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. It is in order for hon. Ndicho to be reading the Society magazine here in the Chamber with his feet up as if he is sitting in his sitting room?\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Ndotto): Certainly it is out of order to do so because magazines and newspapers are not allowed in the Chamber.\nMr. Ndicho: Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was fascinated by an article titled The burden of being a Kikuyu appearing in the Society magazine.\nThe Temporary Deputy Speaker (Mr. Ndotto): Hon. Ndicho, you are even making this matter worse. Please stop reading that magazine.\nThe Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr. Osogo): Mr. Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir, I was saying since my constituents are fishermen, when they come out from the lake, thank God, at least they come out alive, and they would like to socialize by enjoying some kind of brew. I would like the Minister of State, Office of the President, to note this. When fishermen come out of the water, they go to hide in an island and drink <ea/>chang\'aa. On their way come back, their canoes capsize and they drown because they are already drunk. I do not want my constituents to continue dying in that manner. I am sure, when the Minister stands up to reply, he will tell me how he is going to stop the fishermen from taking <ea/>chang\'aa on an island where no policeman can reach them to the detriment of their health.\nI would like to refute the argument that traditional liquor is usually *unhygienically> brewed. I was elected as a representative of ADC in 1956. At that time, there were health inspectors who used to inspect the beer halls to ensure that water was warm and that utensils were washed with hot water. A civilized government can manage that if a colonial government could do that. I do not see how we can fail through our health officers to supervise the cleanliness of brewing this kind of liquor in the rural areas.\nI am aware that there are areas where people are brewing this liquor and if I am challenged to mention them, I will do so. My plea to the Office of the President is that they should consider certain areas where this liquor will not cause chaos or havoc. The law provides that people will have appropriate times for taking this liquor. If the Opposition does not amend this Motion, then the Government should be able to amend it the way I have proposed so that our people are provided with this facility. At the moment, an ordinary person cannot afford to buy beer. A half-kilo Kimbo tin of <ea/>busaa costs about Kshs 5. That tin costs the eight-cornered coin. Once you take that, you can rest.\nDr. Lwali-Oyondi: On a point of order, Mr Temporary Deputy Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Member in order to say that the Kshs 5 coin has eight corners when it has seven corners?\nThe Assistant Minister for Commerce and Industry (Mr. Osogo): I accept that correction. When one drinks the half-kilo Kimbo tin of <ea/>busaa, one gets satisfied. One does not even need any lunch.\nWith these remarks, I reserve my support for the Motion.', 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'c0b2dd40-d414-4bfb-93fc-f7ffab8b15d0', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:00.962433+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9764083027839661, 'non_english_score': 0.023591697216033936}
{'text': 'MOTIONS\nAMENDMENT TO THE LIQUOR ACT II \nI think it is also important that we should look at the traditional liquor as a vital source of income not just for the many poor in the rural areas but also for the local authorities. It is an undisputable fact that while the brewing of these liquors existed, a lot of local authorities at least earned a sizeable income from what we called the "brewing houses", through the sale of traditional liquors. This is because there were licences and other fees derived from the brewing of <ea/>busaa and other such liquors. More importantly, let us not lose sight of the fact that in many places, local people do not have commodities in which to trade and these local liquors have been the main source of income for many of our poor parents and relatives at home. It is also a known fact that if it were not for this traditional liquor, many of us might not have been able to go to school. Many of our poor parents have had to rely entirely on the brewing of <ea/>busaa and other liquors to be able to send their children to school. The banning of these liquors has overly undermined the ability of many of our people to educate their children.\nIt is a known fact that in places like the district where I come from, we do not have any cash crops to rely on for such important requirements as school fees. Indeed, it is these traditional liquors that have enabled many of our people do some little business and be able to get some income in order to meet requirements such as school fees and so on. So, I do think there is a case for the whole issue to be reconsidered and the brewing of <ea/>busaa allowed as one of the businesses to be carried out.\nRight now, you will find that even other businesses such as fish mongering, which used to do well does not do well. This is because our rural women who play a major role by securing food for the family are unable to do that. Since they cannot now generate income from traditional liquor, they are unable to *sucure> vital foodstuffs like fish, which provide the necessary vitamins.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I think if the amendment being asked for is put in place, we may be able to revive this particular business and, in the process, promote other businesses which are allied to these liquors.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, it is also important to unban these brews for another reason, namely that it is a known fact that in the neighbouring countries, notably Tanzania and Uganda, they have what has come to be known as their national spirits. These are the Konyaki in the case of Tanzania and Waragi in the case of Uganda. I think  this is already proving to be a reliable source of income for these countries. I am sure if Kenya were to go ahead and allow the brewing of <ea/>busaa and the rest of it, which is a more reliable source of income than some of those spirits, Kenya could as well be able to come out with its own spirit that would be quite a reliable source of revenue for this country. If we are going to diversify our sources of revenue, and I would advocate that this is going to be another reliable source of revenue for this country, then, for goodness\' sake we should go all out and produce it by getting the necessary mechanism in place, so that we will be able to build a reliable industry based on this particular source.\nWith those few remarks, I beg to support.\nThe Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Sunkuli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I rise to respond to this Motion on behalf of the Government.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to begin by saying that this Motion is based on the wrong premises. As you will realise, that part (b) of the Motion says:-\n"to amend the Traditional Liquor Licensing Act to allow small-scale breweries as well as home brewing for domestic consumption."\nMr. Speaker, Sir, the brewing, sale and consumption of traditional liquor is governed by Cap.122. The reason why I say this Motion is based on the wrong premises is that Section 8 of Cap.122 provides for the licensing of small-scale breweries and indeed for large-scale breweries. The second Schedule of the same Act explains this further. So, if today we amend this Traditional Liquor Licensing Act, it will, in fact, have a negative effect. This is because already the law of this country allows the licensing of small-scale breweries. So, for that primary reason, this Motion should be rejected because it is based on the wrong premise.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, there is also a second reason why this Motion is based on the wrong premise. You also realise that part (a) of the Motion says:-\n"to lift the ban on traditional liquor brewing--"\nThis ban is non-existent; there has never been any ban on the traditional liquor brewing and licensing.\nMr. Shikuku: On a point of order, Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to mislead the House by saying that there is no such ban when we know that His Excellency the President, immediately after taking over the reigns of power, banned all these things? Is he in order to mislead the House? You cannot even brew liquor for circumcision. You know when you want to circumcise your children you have to brew some beer for the old men, but we cannot do that now because of that ban. If one wants to brew some liquor one must seek permission from the assistant chief.\nThe Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Sunkuli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, there has never been a ban on the brewing of traditional liquor. I want to explain the position. What happened is that there has been a suspension on the licensing of brewing of traditional liquor. This was from February, 1979, when the Government received several complaints from members of public that the brewing, sale and consumption of traditional liquor was not being done in accordance with hygienic conditions. The places where the local liquors were brewed and the items used were *unhygienic>. All these were seen as health hazards to the consumers and other residents.\nOther complaints that were received from the public also indicated that people neglected their families. In fact, I have been a personal witness of families that have diminished because of the consumption of traditional liquor and---\nMrs. Ndetei: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to say that families are diminishing because of the consumption of traditional liquor when we know that there are also families diminishing because of the consumption of whisky and even beer from the Breweries?\nThe Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Sunkuli): I am quite in order, Mr Speaker, Sir, because today we are discussing about traditional liquor. I am saying that I am a personal witness of families which started having matrimonial problems because family members could not control themselves because of this liquor which was readily available and they could not raise money to pay school fees for their children. These are complaints which the Government received. There were some shocking cases of people who neglected their families and their matrimonial responsibilities because they were always out on drinking sprees.\nMrs. Ndetei: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister aware that there is a drink now which is being sold in Central Province and in Embu called Cantata which is killing those who consume it within six months after taking it? Is he aware that the brewing of this drink is being licensed by chiefs in those areas? The chief issues licenses immediately after they are applied for but they cannot license the brewing of other liquors.\nMr. Speaker: Order! Hon. Ndetei, you know you have filed a Question on that. Because you have failed a Question, you are probably anticipating the reply you will get. I think it is out of order for you, Mrs. Ndetei, to do that. I urge the Assistant Minister not to respond at this time but to prepare to properly respond to the Question filed by hon. Ndetei when time comes. I would also urge hon. Ndetei to be prepared to question the Assistant Minister further when time is due.\nMr. Shikuku: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My point of order is in connection with the repeated allegation by the Assistant Minister to effect that consumption of traditional liquor leads to breakage in marriages when we know that consumption of whisky and beer causes the same problems. Can he prove that once you take traditional liquor then your marriage just disintegrates?\nThe Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Sunkuli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, traditional liquor has two qualities that make it one of the highest contributors to matrimonial and domestic problems that we have. In the first place there is no longer anything traditional about the consumption of traditional liquor.\nWhen I was a young man---\nMr. Shikuku: You are still young!\nThe Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Sunkuli): Thank you very much. When I was younger than I am today, under our Maasai customs, you had to wait until you were a mature man with a stable family before you were allowed to drink. But you will find that nowadays, there is nothing traditional about the consumption of traditional liquor; it is being consumed by juveniles and by people who cannot in fact sustain the drinking of alcohol. This liquor is no longer being consumed traditionally. Secondly, traditional liquor is so readily available and so cheap that we are, in fact, ending up intoxicating our people by making it very readily available to them. Indeed, there is no amount of amendments that can make this Motion useful.\nMr. Raila: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I did not want to interrupt the Assistant Minister. But is he in order to mislead the House that traditional liquor, which has got a very low alcohol content, is much more addictive or intoxicating than the spirits and wines that have got a higher alcohol content?\nMr. Speaker: Order! Those are points of argument, and I think the Assistant Minister should be allowed to put his points across and then the other hon. Members will get a chance to demolish them.\nThe Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Sunkuli): What I also know Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that if you want to make <ea/>busaa to be very intoxicating you can still do it by raising the alcohol content. It is not a question of the alcohol content but the amount that is consumed. The amount consumed has also the ability of raising the alcohol content.\nI was on the verge of saying that as a result of these complaints the Government asked the district commissioners to investigate whether indeed this was true. Those complaints were discovered to be true. Therefore public <ea/>barazas were held throughout the country and the views of the public were elicited, and these views led to a consensus and a decision by the people of this country that the licensing of brewing of traditional liquor should be suspended. The majority of them did it except, of course, Nairobi Province. This was the only province which voted against the suspension of the licensing of traditional liquor.\nMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, today, in this country, we have decided to suspend the licensing of the brewing of this liquor. What I have said is not just the basis of our ban. But hon. Members know that under Section 10 of the Chief\'s Authority Act, the chief who is the person who understands the local environment can in fact make subsidiary rule to govern the brewing, the sale and the drinking of traditional liquor.\nS1BHN01K\nORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS \nCRITERIA FOR APPOINTING PARASTATAL BOSSES \nMr. Wambua asked the Minister of State, Office of the President, what criteria the government uses in the appointment of Executive and Non-Executive Chairmen of State Corporations.\nThe Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Onyancha): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. The appointment of a chairman, whether Executive or Non-Executive of a State Corporation, is done by the Government in compliance with the provisions of State Corporations Act, which empowers the President to make such appointments. In making such appointments due consultations are made with the respective parent Ministries. Due consideration is also given to possession of the necessary qualifications which may include experience and the needs of the respective organization. The need to consider suitable persons from the various parts of the country is also taken into account. The nature of the work determines whether the appointment is going to be executive or non-executive.\nMr. Wambua: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for his good reply to this Question. I think he does understand very well that these appointees are the people who have retired from the Civil Service and they earn a lot of money in form of pensions and the lumpsum amounts given on retirement. These people retire when they have reached the top grades in the salary scale and are appointed to these posts and earn a salary of KSh. 30,000/= per month while we still face the problem of unemployment of young school leavers.\nCan something be done so that these people who are appointed to these posts are relieved of their jobs in order to create vacancies for the young people who are jobless?\nMr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have already indicated, sometimes these appointments need such experience as is held by some of people who have retired. However, the sentiments which have been expressed by the hon. Member will be taken into account in future.\nMr. Aden: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Arising from the Assistant  Minister\'s reply, can he tell this House how many State Corporations are run by Executive and Non-Executive Chairmen?\nMr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is not part of the original Question neither is it related to it and as such I cannot react to it. If it were, I would have gone in to find out and bring the information to this House.\nMr. Malebe: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Question is asking the criteria used to appoint these chairmen. Could the Assistant Minister detail the standards of qualification, job description as well as common jobs to be performed by these chairmen irrespective of the different types of parastatals before they are appointed?\nMr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is difficult to unify their terms and as I had already indicated, it will depend on the particular organization that we are talking about but definitely experience is a common factor as I indicated earlier.\nMr. Makhanu: Mr. Speaker, Sir, turning back to the issue raised by hon. Aden which is quite relevant here, from the Assistant  Minister\'s personal knowledge could he tell us what action his office takes against those chairmen who are not executive but do behave like executive chairmen? For example, the gentleman in Nzoia Sugar Company behaves like an executive chairman when he is not. What action do you take against such chairmen?\nMr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are not aware that the Chairman mentioned behaves like an executive chairman. If he does and we get proper and full information we will look into the matter and take any necessary action. But we have no such information.\nMr. Falana: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister tell this House whether retirement from the civil service is one of the qualifications needed to enable someone to be appointed to the post of executive chairman of a State corporation? How can a person retire from the Civil Service and then get re-employed by the same Government?\nMr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, retirement from the Civil Service is not one of the qualifications taken into consideration when appointing chairmen of parastatals. However, some of these retired people are considered, as a matter of fact, to have some of the skills we need in these particular organizations.\nMr. Wambua: These people are paid their benefits when they retire. A person may earn about KShs. 7,000/- in the form of pension and on top of that he may be earning another KShs. 30,000/- from another source every month. Could the Assistant Minister assure me that they are looking into this matter because we have a lot of people who are loitering without employment?\nMr. Onyancha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I indicated earlier, what has been pointed out, that is lack of employment, will be considered during future appointments. I gave the hon. Member that assurance.\nMr. Speaker: Mr. Jalang\'o\'s Question.\nNEW COMPUTERS FOR GOVERNMENT COMPUTER CENTRE \nMr. Jalang\'o asked the Vice-President and Minister for Finance in view of the current old age of computers installed at the Government Computer Centre, when the Ministry will replace these outdated and frequently breaking down equipment to ensure the timely processing of teachers and civil servants payrolls, pension schemes and other applications.\nMr. Speaker: Anybody here from the Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance? Next Question.\nN.H.I.F. CARD FOR MR. MUIA \nMr. Wambua asked the Minister for Health why the management of National Health Insurance Fund (N.H.I.F.) has failed to issue the card for Mr. G.K. Muia Fund No. 4876, and when it will be issued.\nThe Assistant Minister for Health (Mr. Ogur): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\nIn the records of the N.H.I.F. there are four people with fairly close similar names but with different Identity Card numbers. Their names are as follows: Messrs. Muia Gideon K.; Gideon Kitele Muia; Muia Gedeon Kititu; Muia Gregory K. Each has a different Fund Number. Their I.D. Card Numbers are different. Except for the last one, Muia Gregory K., none of the above named persons has a Fund No. 4876 as the hon. Member has stated. In any case the N.H.I.F. Numbers usually range between six to seven digits. I do therefore advise hon. Wambua to request Mr. Muia to call on the Director of the National Hospital Insurance Fund with his details and he will be assisted.\nMr. Wambua: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the first name is the one I had asked about, Mr. Muia Gideon Kioko.\nMr. Ogur: Therefore, Mr. Speaker, Sir, Mr. Muia Gideon K. has N.H.I.F. No. 058246 and his I.D. Number is 0060095/50. That closes the chapter.\nMr. Wambua: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I thank the Assistant Minister for that reply. But why has it taken the Fund three years without Mr. G.K. Muia getting a card from the N.H.I.F.?\nMr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not aware that it has taken him that long to get it.\nMr. Wambua: It is upon the Fund to post the card to the applicant and not for the applicant to go for the card. Is it necessary for him to travel all the *OM> from Kibauni Location to Nairobi to collect that card when it can be posted to him?\nMr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is absolutely unnecessary for him to travel from Kibauni to Nairobi but I think it is necessary when there is delay somewhere. If three years were too many he should have gone to the N.H.I.F. headquarters earlier than that.\nMr. Wambua: I want the Assistant Minister to assure me that the certificate is there. If it is there can it be posted to the gentleman so that he does not have to incur unnecessary travelling expenses to come and collect the certificate.\nMr. Ogur: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if he gives us his correct address we will do that.\nTITLE DEEDS FOR MIKINDANI AND CHAANI TENANTS \nMr. Kiliku asked the Minister for Lands and Housing:-\n(a) why the Ministry has failed to issue title deeds to the tenants of Mikindani and Chaani Site and Service Scheme; and\n(b) when these title deeds will be issued.\nThe Minister for Lands and Housing (Mr. Mbela): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\nMy Ministry has not failed to issue title deeds to tenants of Mikindani and Chaani Site and Service Scheme because such a request has not been received by the Ministry from the Municipal Council of Mombasa which is administering the two schemes.\nThe title deeds will be issued when a formal request to that effect is submitted to my Ministry by the Municipal Council of Mombasa.\nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I asked this same Question last year and the Minister gave the same reply he has given today. He also promised to find out from the Mombasa Municipal Council why there was a delay in processing these things. What action is the Minister taking because his Ministry is responsible for issuing title deeds and not the Municipal Council of Mombasa?\nMr. Mbela: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member is quite right. I made that promise last year. I indeed contacted the Mombasa Municipal Council and asked them whether they needed assistance from the Ministry by way of surveying and sub-division of the plots and they told us that they did not need our assistance. Since that time they have not made any request for title deeds to be made available to them for onward transmission to the tenants.\nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Mombasa Municipal Council advertised the tender and Messrs. Kasi and Surveyors won the tender at KShs. 3.6 million. But one of the officials of the Municipal Council demanded a kick-back of KShs. 500,000/- from that amount. The Surveyor refused to carry out the work of surveying. Could the Minister direct the Surveyor to continue with the work for that amount of KShs. 3.6 million without paying kick-backs to anybody?\nMr. Mbela: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I do not know what evidence the hon. Member has about the kick-back allegation. I am in no position to give directives to the Municipal Council of Mombasa to take the action hon. Kiliku is asking for. That request ought to be directed to the Minister for Local Government.\nMr. Kiliku: I have evidence because I have a letter here which awarded the job to Messrs. Kasi and Surveyors at KShs. 3.6 million but he said that he could not continue with the job because he was told by one of the local councillors to pay KShs. 500,000.00 out of that money. He said that if he did that he would not get anything out of the job. That is why he could not continue with the job. I do not have the letter with me here now. But could the Minister direct that the work should continue?\nMr. Mbela: Mr. Speaker Sir, I said that I am not competent to direct the Municipal Council of Mombasa since they come under the Minister for Local Government. As far as the other details are concerned, I would suggest that the questioner makes that information available to the Minister for Local Government because even if he gave it to me I would not know how to interpret the `kick-back\' that he is talking about.\nMr. Aden: Mr. Speaker Sir, it appears my colleague hon Kiliku has made a very serious allegation which entails corruption. It is my feeling that House should not let it go without proper substantiation. Can he give evidence that there was a demand of 10 % as a `kick-back\'?\nMr. Kiliku: I did not say 10 %. I said shs. 500,000. That is what I was told and that is why the work is not being done. The letter to give out the work is there. There is no other evidence apart from that.\nMr. Speaker: Order! Hon members it is within the right of hon members to speak and shout whatever they want. \nS1BHN02K\nQUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE\nCATTLE RUSTLING IN KINNA LOCATION \nMr. Jaldesa: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask  the Minister of State the following Question by Private Notice.\n(a) Is the Minister aware that some cattle were stolen from Kinna Location of Garba-Tula Division on 17th March, 1992?\n(b) If the answer to part (a) is in the affirmative, how many of the said stolen cattle have since been recovered and how many culprits have been apprehended?\nThe Minister of State, Office of the President (Mr. Kanyi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\n(a) Yes, I am aware of the incident.\n(b) A total of 129 head of cattle were recovered by the security personnel on 20.3.92. No arrests have been made so far.\nMr. Jaldesa: Mr. Speaker, about 2000 head of cattle was stolen from Kinna, which happens to border Meru. If no animals are recovered during this time of drought we are foreseeing a lot of danger. As you are aware Somalians have no Government now and are flocking here with guns. Is the Minister satisfied with the action taken so far? I know members of the Kenya Army, Anti-Stock Theft Unit and Police are involved and if they cannot recover cattle stolen we are in danger. What assurance is the Minister giving on the matter?\nMr. Kanyi: Mr. Speaker, I would like to give additional information, which may help the hon. Member. On 18.3.92 at 4.30 a.m. a report was received at Garba-Tula Police Station that 1,000 head of cattle were stolen at Kinna Location by 22 armed bandits. A team of security personnel, assisted by a chopper was instantly dispatched to the scene. On arriving at the scene of the incident the security personnel discovered that a second attack had already been conducted by the rustlers who had stolen another 600 head of cattle and killed three people, namely Abdi Hussein Omar, Abdi Noor Farah and Yafi Kenai Hussein. The security personnel combed the surrounding area in pursuit of the bandits. On 20.3.92 at Kipsanandi Game Reserve they recovered the 129 head of cattle. The operation is still continuing.\nMr. Jaldesa: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Minister satisfied with the progress being made in this case? On our part, we are not satisfied at all.\nMr. Kanyi: Mr. Speaker, I am satisfied because a lot of security personnel from the Kenya Army, Kenya Police, Administration Police and Kenya Wildlife Service, who also have at their disposal the services of a chopper, have been deployed in this area. I am quite satisfied with the progress they are making because they are still pursuing the bandits.\nMr. Falana: Mr. Speaker, recently the whole country went mad over the Rift Valley tribal clashes, but the rampant tribal clashes in Isiolo, Tana River and certain parts of Garissa seem to receive very little attention. The cattle stolen from these areas are not taken to Somalia, but are brought to Dandora for slaughter. The Minister is misleading the House by saying he is satisfied. The people in these areas are more used to the bandits than to the security personnel and know that it is a total mistake for a resident to report the whereabouts of bandits because the moment you do that they will come back and kill you. Could the Minister, therefore, give a serious assurance this practice will stop once for all as has \n[Mr. Falana]\nbeen done in the past?\nMr. Kanyi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government is greatly concerned about what is happening in this part of our country. You can see the number of security personnel that has already been despatched to the area. In actual fact, the hon. Member is aware that there are very thick forests in the area, and it is very difficult to get to some of the places.\nMr. Falana: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.\nMr. Speaker: Mr. Falana, the Minister is still answering your point of order! Continue, Mr. Kanyi.\nMr. Kanyi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is not the first time that this kind of thing has happened, and the Government is doing all it can to contain the situation. Through the co-operation of the Government, the local people have been enabled to have homeguards in their areas. I would like to appeal to the hon. Member to liaise with other hon. Members from the area and the neighbouring districts to ensure that security is maintained.\nMr. Falana: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Minister is misleading this House and the nation at large. When he says that the area is thickly forested, I am surprised because that area is a desert. Where the hell does the forest come from? There is no question of forests; the fact is just that the security is not all that satisfying. We want real assurance because people are finding it very rough. Livestock is gone and human lives have gone. A week does not pass without 20 or 30 people from Tana River, Hola and Isiolo dying. These are human lives and we want real assurance now from the Minister.\nMr. Kanyi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that the security personnel is still there; they have not been withdrawn. The security officers are still pursuing the bandits and we have reason to believe that they will be apprehended and the cattle recovered.\nMr. Speaker: We must move on now.\nMr. Jaldesa: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.\nMr. Speaker: Order, hon. Jaldesa. The Minister has said that all manner of security personnel, including the army and the police are still pursuing the bandits, and that is enough assurance unless you can prove it is not true. If you cannot prove otherwise, then we have to continue.\nMr. Jaldesa: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.\nMr. Speaker: No! I have ruled that there are not going to be any more points of order on this matter. We still have two more Questions to go. Mr. Kiliku\'s Question.\nREASONS FOR EVICTING MIKINDANI RESIDENTS\nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Local Government the following Question by Private Notice.\n(a) Why did Mombasa Municipal Council issue quit notices on 18th and 19th March, 1992, and directed the residents of Gona Hola, Vitengeni and Bangladesh villages in Mikindani to demolish their houses within 14 days?\n(b) Could the Minister order this council to allocate the plots to the said residents and revoke the quit notices?\nThe Assitant Minister for Local Government (Mr. Wagura): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\n(a) The quit notices were given because those people were settling on the council\'s land illegally.\n(b) The Minister cannot allocate the plots to those illegal settlers until the right procedure has been followed. That means that when it comes to giving out those plots there is a procedure to follow and the people affected are free to apply like anybody else.\nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Mombasa District Development Committee has recommended that all squatters in the district be settled. Therefore, could the Minister revoke these quit notices because these people should be settled where they are living at the moment as per the district development committee recommendations?\nMr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the first place, those people are there illegally. Secondly, some of the squatters had been allocated plots which they sold. Some of the allottees built and completed their houses but, instead of living in those houses they rented them and went to squat. That is why we are saying that we need the hon. Member\'s co-operation to ensure that those people move. The Minister does not mind giving them a month\'s notice instead of 14 days\' notice.\nMr. Kiliku: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister has said that some squatters were allocated plots which they later on sold. Can he substantiate that claim because it is wrong according to me?\nMr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I meant what I have said. I have a list here including a Mr. John. M. Mwadiga, Mr. Kyengo, Mr. Kazungu, Mr. Hussein, Mr. Salim, Mr. Meli Ngute and others. The list is long. Those people were allocated plots and they sold them. Those who have not sold their plots have built houses and rented them instead of settling on them. We are trying to discourage that kind of thing.\nMr. Kubo: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister is misleading this House because I know the first man whose name he read personally and I know that he is a resident of Mikindani. Is it not true that the Assistant Minister is misleading the House since I know that the first man he mentioned has not plot in the area?\nMr. Wagura: This particular person, Mr. Speaker, is among those who have put up houses but are squatting in the affected area.\nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Assistant Minister has only mentioned six people whereas he should have substantiated by say who was allocated which plot and sold it to who. I am talking of 1,200 residents and the Assistant Minister mentioned only six names and said that they are going to be considered along with the others. Who are these others? Wakubwa?\nMr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, you appreciate the fact that the land in this country does not belong to any particular ethnic group. If today the council decided to give out those plots, everybody in this country would be entitled to apply.\nMr. Kiilu: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Question has said that he is talking of more than 1,200 people. Could the Assistant Minister tell us the number of people whose names are in that piece of paper he read?\nMr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to know what interest the hon. Member has in this matter. Of course, I will lay the list on the Table. \nMr. Kiilu: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I asked my question *becaue> the Assistant Minister simply mentioned the names of six people. Can we be told how many names are in that list?\nMr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the list is very long. I have just given an example of what is happening. Even if it was only one person who was there illegally, that is enough to nullify their squatting on that land.\nMr. J.N. Mungai: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It has become the habit of the Ministry of Local Government that whenever highly placed people want plots go around hunting for them and when they find areas where poor people are settled -- And we saw this happening at Muoroto in Nairobi here. Can we be told clearly here whether there are some landless people in that area and how many they are and where he expects to settle them? How many of them have plots elsewhere and are refusing to leave that place?\nMr. Wagura: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that particular scheme was started between 1979 and 1980. At the time there were quite a number of applicants, out of whom 400 qualified for allocation of plots. The argument now is that some of the allottees have decided to leave their plots to go and squat \nelsewhere. That is why we are saying that the land there belongs to the council and the council has not yet decided to allocate plots. When the time comes, some of the genuine squatters will be settled. That is why we are saying that instead of the 14 days\' quit notice given earlier, we are now giving them 30 days to quit.\nMr. Speaker: I will allow Mr. Godana to ask the last supplementary question because we have another Question coming, and the time is gone. Questions must be dealt with within the allotted time. So, hon. Members should not try to go beyond this time by asking 20 supplementary questions as one question because that is not good.\nS1BHN03K\nORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS\nREASONS FOR HIKING PRICES \nMr. Wambua asked the Vice-President and Minister for Finance whether in view of the fact that our annual budget is approved by this House every year, he could explain the reasons that necessitate upward price adjustments of essential commodities like sugar, flour and cooking oil after the approval of the annual estimates.\nThe Assistant Minister, Office of the Vice-President and Ministry of Finance (Mr. Kariuki): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\nIt is true that this House approves the annual budget every year. It should, however, be appreciated that, although annual budget may result in increase or decrease of prices due to fiscal measures taken, price changes are not the scope nor the purpose of the annual budgets. Indeed, the annual budget may not contain any price changes at all. There are various factors that affect prices which singly or in combination, lead to revision of prices after the annual budget. The factors which have at one time or another contributed to the revision of price increases for sugar, flour and cooking oil are:-\n(i) Increase in the cost of raw materials, including producer prices, (ii) price increase on inputs utilised in manufacture of the products, (iii) strengthening of major currencies against the Kenya shilling or (iv) increase in financing charges.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, for the information of the hon. Member and the House, when we talk about the budget, we are talking about a Government statement regarding Government\'s proposals to collect revenue and how it proposes to spend that revenue. Any increase in prices of certain commodities during the budget is a fiscal measure. In other words, here Government is trying to raise revenue and this must be differentiated with other increases in prices that come after the budget and which, as I said, may come about due to increased in the cost of raw materials and so on. When the  prices of raw materials increase, this has nothing to do with Government revenue or Government expenditure and hence has nothing to do with the budget. If we increase, say the price of beer during the budget, that is a fiscal measure because it is a way of raising revenue for the Government. However, when we increase the price of sugar, flour and so on due to the producer cost of sugar cane having gone up, this has nothing to do with the budget. I think the hon. Members should be able to differentiate these two aspects.\nMr. Wambua: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while thanking the Assistant Minister for the answer he has given, would he not agree with me that not all the people in the country are educated to know what he has been saying. All I know is that when <ea/>wananchi hear of the budget, they take it to be the final authority for increasing the prices of commodities. For example, last year when the budget was read, it took only two days for the Government to announce an increase in the price of Kimbo, maize flour, and sugar. As a result of this, <ea/>wananchi then started wondering what was the purpose of reading the budget in the first place. Could the Assistant Minister tell us what arrangements his Ministry has to educate our people to come out of their present mentality that once the budget is read, that is final and that prices of essential commodities should not be increased after a few days. \nMr. Kariuki: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would not like to mislead the hon. Members or the public. Telling members of the public that there is not going to be price increases after the budget, would be misleading them. If after the budget we are told to increase the producer prices of sugar or flour because the price of fuel has gone up, then how can we tell the people that we are not going to increase the prices after the budget. I think hon. Members would agree with me that they have the responsibility of educating members of public not to term the increase of prices of essential commodities after the budget as mini budgets because that is a very misleading term. When Members of Parliament describe these increases as mini budgets, they give members of the public the impression that the Government is revising its budget which is not the case. We are living in a pragmatic world where there will be continuous increases of fuel, where the Kenyan currency will continue to fluctuate against other major currencies; where interest rates will keep on going higher and higher and therefore, we cannot as a responsible Government assure the public that there will be no price increases after the budget. It would not be realistic to say that.\nMr. Wambua: Mr. Speaker, Sir, would the Assistant Minister not agree with me that they have enough time to carry out thorough research before they present the budget here. Why can they not consult the people concerned so that at least when the budget is read, it can take a month or so before these increases or mini budget come about.\nMr. Kariuki: Mr. Speaker, Sir, anybody with the knowledge of the existing events in the world today would know how impossible it would be to predict anything. I think what the hon. Member is trying to ask us to do is impossible. How do you foretell that there is not going to be an increase in the fuel prices from the Middle East; how are you going to foretell that the Kenya shilling is not going to fluctuate downwards from what is it now? We do not have in Treasury soothsayers who can assist us in foretelling world events before they can happen. It is for this reason that we could not foretell that there was going to be war in the Middle East. How do we foretell that there is not going to be some political problem somewhere in the world which would cause fluctuation of price or in the interest rates and so on? The hon. Member is asking us in Treasury to act as God which, of necessity, we cannot.\nMr. Kiilu: Is the Assistant Minister aware that the public is not interested in what he saying? Why does the Government increase prices of commodities soon after the Budget is read? The public knows that it is only when the Budget is read that prices are announced officially.\nMr. Kariuki: It behoves on all of us in this august House to do what we can to educate the members of the public. This is why I have given a detailed answer so that the hon. Members who are here can assist in explaining to the members of the public as to why it becomes necessary to increase prices of goods from time to time.\nFor example, Sir, ----\nMr. Speaker: Order! You have to cut short this long exposition, Mr. Kariuki. Come to the point and proceed.\nMr. Kariuki: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was just trying to explain because I have been told to explain why these things happen. I have just said that it behoves on all of us to educate the members of the public with regard to the fact that I have already mentioned and which I am not going to repeat. \nMr. Anaswa: Now that the Assistant Minister is aware that there must be price increases from time to time, is it not possible within the budgetary system to set aside some amount of money which could be used to offset some of these fluctuations?\nMr. Kariuki: This is forcing me to repeat myself once again. During Budget time, we talk about Government revenue and expenditure. These other increases may be necessary because the providers of raw materials require more money to provide these materials. The two do not tie up. How can we provide for these during the Budget? We cannot.\nMr. Speaker: Next Question.\nELECTRICITY PROJECT FOR MWALA \nMr. Wambua asked the Minister for Energy:-\n(a) whether he is aware that over 1000 people in Masii area of Mwala Constituency paid a deposit of shs 500/- each for the rural electrification project in 1986; and\n(b) what has delayed the *completionof> this project and when it will be completed.\nThe Minister for Energy (Mr. Kyalo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\n(a) I am not aware that over 1000 people in Masii area of Mwala Constituency paid a deposit of shs 500/- each in 1986.\n(b) I am therefore now aware of any delayed project dating back to 1986 in Mwala Constituency.\nMr. Wambua: Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform the Minister that this Question came up in June, 1991 and  what I was given was that ways and means were being worked out so that electricity could be installed in that place. The people in that paid the money in 1986, which is about seven years now and they still keeping their receipts, waiting for the service to be provided. I am surprised to hear the Minister say he is not aware of this case when the money has been in his office for six good years. Either the service is provided or the people are given back their money with interest.\nMr. Kyalo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to inform the hon. Member that people have a right to make private arrangements so that electricity is provided for them.\nMr. Wambua: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the Minister is misleading the House. Money was paid to the Ministry and people were not supposed to make private arrangements for the provision in *thier> area. If that was the case, why were they told to pay the money to the Ministry?\nMr. Kyalo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to make one thing clear that there are areas that are designated "rural electrification areas". By 1986 Masii had not yet been designated a "rural electrification area, which meant that money was set aside by the Ministry to electrify the place. But people - and this happened in quite a number of places in Machakos District - contributed money and deposited it with the Kenya Power and Lighting Company [KPLC], which is quite normal.\nMr. Malebe: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Minister says that it is normal to deposit money with the KPLC for the rural electrification project. Is he in order to say that this money was paid to the company? I know that you deposit money with the KPLC when a service line from the main line to your house. Is he saying you deposit money with the company even if you have no service line from the main line to your house?\nMr. Kyalo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, although that sounds like a different question all together let me inform the hon. Member that no money was deposited with the KPLC for rural electrification. But Masii people, and practically in most parts of Machakos District, paid money but by then the areas had not been designated for rural electrification.\nMr. Kubo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is clear that money was deposited; this money may not have come under the rural electrification project: it may have come under the normal commercial supplies. So, can the Minister tell us whether the money came under the rural electrification project or the normal commercial electrification programme and how soon those who paid the money will get electricity?\nMr. Kyalo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if some  of these people are within 600 metres of transformers they may apply for rural electrification which is going on in Masii and Mwala Locations and there will be no problem with giving them electricity.\nMr. Wambua: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think these paid the in the belief that they would be supplied with electricity. The area was surveyed about two years ago, and I am surprised that the Minister does not seem to be aware of this.\nS1BHN04K\nMOTION\nADOPTION OF SESSIONAL PAPER NO. 1 OF 1992 \nTHAT, this House adopts Sessional paper No. 1 of 1992 on Development and Employment in Kenya, laid on the Table on  25th March, 1992.\nMr. Speaker: hon. J.N. Mungai will continue.\nMr. J.N. Mungai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I mentioned about the environment; the creation of conducive environment so that we can attract local foreign investors. You will find that although foreign investors would like to invest in this country there is also another problem that the investors are facing. This is the problem of taxation. Taxation in Kenya is exaggerated; the taxes are killing. Investors may not accept to invest here because most of their money goes to taxation. If you look at the taxes you will find that they are eating on the profits of the investors. If you look at PAYE you will find that that is another tax which is also hitting wage earners very hard. Income tax is the same. If you look at the services charge it is the same. We tried to remove services charge this morning and although we lost but I am sure the point was made. Those who made us lose are being waited for outside there. The people know what they did this morning. They know themselves. They are the Front-benchers.\nMr. Speaker: Order! Hon. Members I want you to study the Standing Orders and acquaint yourselves with the relevant parts. There is a section which does not allow hon. Members to discuss a matter that has already been disposed of or to anticipate a matter which is coming in the form of a Bill or a Motion. Hon. Mungai is going back to discuss something that has been discussed. You are not allowed to do that by Standing Orders.\nHon. Members: Shame! Shame!\nMr. J.N. Mungai: I know about the particular Standing Order. It is Standing Order No. 69.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I am talking about a tax called service charge tax that is not giving a good environment to the investors in the country. I emphasise that we shall need to scrap off this tax because investors are paying heavily and yet no services rendered. It is the same with other taxes. We make somebody invest and then tax him so heavily. We make somebody invest in the country and do not allow him to repatriate some of his profits. If we want to employ our people and then we want more money into our coffers, then we shall never make it.\nMr. arap Soi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for hon. Njenga Mungai to discuss a Motion that was rejected this morning by the House?\nMr. Speaker: I think so long as hon. Njenga Mungai does not refer to the Motion discussed this morning, he is in order. We are discussing about this Sessional Paper No. 1 of 1992 on Development and Employment in Kenya. You say there are certain obstacles and you also talk about tax in general. As long as you confine yourself to various types of taxes without referring to what was discussed in the morning, then you are in order. So be careful how you go about it.\nMr. J.N. Mungai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will go by your ruling. In fact, I am talking about taxes in general. However, I think, hon. arap Soi has some interest in the matter.\nMr. arap Soi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Could the hon. Member declare what interests I have in the matter since I have none? He should not impute improper motive to me.\nMr. J.N. Mungai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think hon. arap Soi knows what interests he has in the matter and it is not for me to mention them.\nMr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Njenga Mungai! In fact, you could be a very good debater and contributor if you watched a few things, such as not imputing improper motives to other Members and so on. So be careful!\nMr. J.N. Mungai: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I am only appealing to the Minister that in trying to encourage investors to come and invest here, it is also important that we should take care. We should take all precautions and one of them is taxation. I am sure it is clear to everybody that we tend to overtax investors in our country. We are just about the highest in the world in taxation. That is why I said instead of people coming to invest here they prefer going to other countries with lower taxes. \nTaxation is not just a question of how much the Government can make to the coffers. It is also important to note that the biggest responsibility of our Government is the welfare of our people that must be well-taken care of. If we do not do that, then it is better to avoid such taxation. Taxation today on Value Added Tax (V.A.T.) is very high and there is no reason for that when we have so many unemployed people. We must not sacrifice the employment of our people at the expense of taxation. This is why I call upon the Minister for Planning and National Development to seriously look into the taxation policy.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, we also have another problem arising out of "letters of no objection". When our good friends who fly flags want to do a favour to somebody, they give letters of no objection so that person can import certain commodities free of duty and yet those commodities are also locally manufactured here. Now, that is "killing" the local industries. The technology we have here is not equal to that from overseas which is very advanced. Their total production is low but ours is high. We have imported technology from them and probably they have given us a second-hand material of technology. Therefore, we must make sure that before any letter of no objection is issued to an importer, a thorough investigation is carried out in our industries to establish whether such commodities are also manufactured locally. Such letters must be stopped forthwith for locally manufactured goods. We can allow importation but not for locally manufactured goods. This is tantamount to "killing" our local investors.\nThe Minister for Industry (Mr. ole Kaparo): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I would like hon. Njenga Mungai to cite an instance where a licence had been given to import goods that are locally manufactured here because it is not good to blame the Government?\nMr. J.N. Mungai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is very unfortunate since I do not have a document, but if the hon. Member wishes to challenge me, I am prepared to lay the documents on the Table, say, in a week\'s time. He is the Minister for Industry and should know better.\nThe Minister for Industry (Mr. ole Kaparo): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is against the Standing Orders for a person to speculate matters that are not particularly within his knowledge. Hon. Njenga Mungai has made very serious allegations here and it is upon him to prove the truth of every utterance that he makes in the House. Therefore, since he is over-charged or overtaxed, can he either withdraw or substantiate the allegation?\nMr. J.N. Mungai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not going to withdraw, but given only one week, I will be able to substantiate.\nThe Minister for Industry (Mr. ole Kaparo): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. It is really in order for a Member of this House to make an inflammatory statement and then asks for time to substantiate?\nMr. Speaker: Hon. Members, I think it is important for us to debate in this House in a cordial atmosphere so that there can be room for some sense of humour occasionally. Hon. Mungai has made a statement that, I am sure, the knowledgeable people of this country would disagree with completely. For instance, importing things by certain individuals which are locally made here in the country cannot in all aspects be considered illegal. There are professionals who would understand why this cannot be considered to be illegal. However, Mr. Mungai is within his rights to disagree with that and I think he is entitled to his opinion. Hon. ole Kaparo as a Government Minister too has a right to challenge the correctness of what hon. Mungai is saying that the cost of production in developed countries is lower. This may not be the case because the cost of labour here maybe much lower and that is why some multinationals like investing in Kenya. However, that is for hon. ole Kaparo to raise as a challenge to what hon. Mungai is saying.\nSo, hon. Members, I would like to see an atmosphere of give and take; an atmosphere of freedom of expression without anybody unnecessarily being taken into task to prove the authenticity of what he may be saying as a matter of personal opinion.\nThe Assistant Minister for Manpower Development and Employment (Mr. Otwani): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Whereas I entirely agree with your ruling regarding the atmosphere of good debate in this House, I am sure you will agree with me that hon. Mungai has become notorious for issuing reckless statements. Therefore, I think he has to substantiate his allegation now or withdraw it for a week until he comes back to the House with full substantiation.\nMr. J.N. Mungai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if hon. Members would give me the chance to come back here and substantiate my remarks after a week or so, I will be able to substantiate fully. Perhaps even some of the hon. Ministers in this House are putting on imported suits and they think that I do not know where the documents to prove my case are. Do we not have textile industries in Kenya today? Are we supposed to import our suits? Why *cann\'t> they buy Raymond suits that are made in Kenya instead of going to England to buy suits from there? I think the hon. Minister for Industry is wearing an imported suit. This is why I am saying that we are not here to cover corruption. We are talking about creating an environment to attract investment. It is unfortunate that the Minister is trying to challenge us. If given the chance to come back after a week to substantiate, I will prove beyond any reasonable doubt that there is corruption involved in these things and I do not think that would be encouraging investment in this country.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I know that hon. ole Kaparo went to the Ministry of Industry the other day. However, I am sure he is going to correct the situation. I am in another one year, nobody will be given a letter of objection to import. I am saying this because I know the present Minister for Industry is an upright man and I congratulate him for this. This is why I am saying that we definitely need to think about the development of this country. We must support our beloved President who has given us positions of high management so that we can speak in this House about the national management for the benefit of the people of this land. However, each time we try to open up the way that can lead us to some truth, somebody must stand up and say. "So-and-so is undermining the Government. So-and-so is doing this or that". We do not want anybody to stand in the way of truth during this era of transparency. We do not want anybody to think we are fighting each other. What we are trying to do is to correct whatever wrong has been done so that things in our country can be done in an upright manner.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I am also opposed strongly to Government investment in parastatals. \nS1BHN05K\nWORKERS\' CHILDREN EDUCATION SCHEME \nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move the following Motion:\nTHAT, in view of the fact that members of the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) benefit from the fund only after retirement, and considering that children of many of the workers have been missing secondary school and university education because of lack of school fees; this House urges the Government to establish a "Workers\' Children Education Scheme" within the NSSF to lend soft loans to all members for school fees.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I decided to move this Motion after seeing the mismanagement that is subjected to the workers\' money by a few millionaires who have been enjoying the economy of this country since Independence. It is immaterial to give somebody money after 55 years when his children could not go to school because of lack of school fees. I propose that the Government should establish a "Social Security Bank" where all the money collected as NSSF contribution should go so that members can get loans through the NSSF. As I am talking now --\nMr. Falana: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. As much as I do not want to interrupt the hon. Kiliku, this is a very important Motion with a purpose and it definitely needs some attention but I wonder if there is anyone from the Ministry of Labour and Manpower Development taking notes. I Know that the Minister is out, there are no Government officials here and I do not know whether the hon. Kiliku is simply talking to the "air".\nMr. Speaker: Order! I thought the hon. Falana was the Deputy Chief Whip.\nMr. Falana: I am, Sir.\nMr. Speaker: He should be telling us precisely who is taking charge of that Motion.\nThe Assistant Minister for Public Works and Housing (Mr. Mwamzandi): Sir, I am taking notes of behalf of the Minister.\nMr. Falana: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.\nMr. Speaker: Mr. Falana, I hope you are not taking issue with what I have just ruled with regard to what you had raised. As the Deputy Chief Whip, on the Government side, you should be in the know of the arrangements your side is making on Motions that come before the House.\nMr. Falana: I am taking issue, Sir. There is no doubt that I am the Deputy Chief Whip of the Government side and that is why I am concerned with whatever is going on in this House. My office did not know that there was somebody to respond, on behalf of the Minister, to the hon. Member\'s Motion. It is because of that concern that I needed clarification as to whether there was somebody taking notes on what is being said on this Motion.\nMr. Speaker: Mr. Falana, I thought the hon. Mwamzandi had made that point clear.\nProceed, Mr. Kiliku.\nMr. Kiliku: Anyway, the Opposition is used to talking to stones but one day we shall crush the stone! The workers of this country ---\nThe Assistant Minister for Agriculture, Livestock Development and Marketing (Dr. Misoi): On a point of order, Sir. Is it in order for the hon. Kiliku to tell this House that the Opposition is used to talking to stones? Is that in order? We are not stones.\nMr. Speaker: Order, hon. Members! I do not want us to get bogged down at this early hour on unnecessary points of order and taking away the time of the hon. Kiliku in moving this Motion. I thought he was expressing his views and Dr. Misoi, you of course, have contrary views. Once the debate is open, you will be at liberty to express your views as you wish.\nProceed, Mr. Kiliku.\nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the workers of this country who are members of the NSSF qualify, beyond any reasonable doubt, as slaves of the millionaires of this nation. This is because their money is being invested elsewhere without their knowledge and consent. They do not benefit from their assets like building. Their money is used to buy buildings and to finance very big projects without their consent. How do you describe a slave, Mr. Speaker, Sir? I think a slave is a person who works without pay.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I hope this Government will change because we are now in a multi-party democracy. Since 1967 workers have been victimised by millionaires in this country and it is high time that the Government changed and responded to the demands of the people. Members of the Government may be like a stone wall, but there has not been nothing harder than the former Berlin wall which has now been demolished. This is another era in which the Government must be accountable and transparent. This is workers\' money and the Minister should tell the House the financial position of the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) as of now. He must also tell the House why Shs Nine billion of the Fund is in a suspense account. Very few millionaires who have been managing this Fund have been loaning themselves this money through their financial institutions.\nIf this time the Government will fails to listen to the people we will tell the people to demand that the Government listens to them. This is because there will be no alternative but to tell the people to demand money so that the Government listens. This is a democratic Government but it not listening to very people who elected it. If the people come up and demand to be listened to, the Government will have not choice but to listen to them. We cannot continue witnessing mismanagement of the NSSF money being perpetrated by our very brothers with whom we have trusted with positions in the Fund. They are taking this money into their pockets.\nIt is no use to be in this House if we cannot solve the problems of the same people who have elected us into this House. Instead of the Government implementing the people\'s wishes it is engaged in political propaganda, while at the end of the day it will be a failure. Kanu is the ruling party and it should listen to the what the people say and implement it. There is no need of being on the defensive always and also engaging in propaganda. Instead of dealing with workers and farmers problems Kanu is engaging itself in endless propaganda. It is almost a year since the last general election but the Government has achieved nothing, except propaganda. We do not want a Government which is engaging itself in propaganda instead of implementing policies aimed at promoting the welfare of the tax payers who are financing that Government. Kanu has been going round saying that it is Opposition which is calling upon international donors not to give aid to this country. This is wrong and misleading because the main condition which has been set by the IMF and World Bank for resumption of aid to the country is elimination of corruption. If the Government stops corruption in the same Government we will get aid.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, the Minister for Labour and Manpower Development deliberately escaped from the House because this Motion was coming up for discussion and he would be held responsible for what has been happening in the NSSF with workers money, which is really not Government money. This year some parents could not send their children to school because of the high school fees charges. Even the Minister for Education has added to the parents\' burden by shifting the responsibility of paying board of governors workers in schools to them. I am appealing that Kanu stops spreading the gospel about who from which area is being groomed for the Vice-Presidency because this will help us. Even Kanu leaders are undermining one another. Even in the Opposition everybody wants to be this or that. Our problem is not going to State House or Presidency; our problem is the peoples\'s problems. Let those who are blessed by God go to State and listen to the 24 million Kenyans, but not engage themselves in politicking.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I would like the Minister to outline how the contract on the NSSF House extension complex, which is under construction, was awarded and how much money has been spent on this complex. We want the Minister to tell us ---\nMr. Arte: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I think the Motion is very clear. It is talking of establishment of an educational fund under the NSSF. It is not on how NSSF money is used on contracts.\nMr. Speaker: Proceed, Mr. Kiliku.\nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I just sympathise with the hon. Member, but that is the kind of material we have on that side. I want the Minister to bring the signed contract on this matter here so that we see how money was used on that building. We are in multi-party democracy and we are not scared of anybody. The truth should be brought here for us to know who was given that contract, under what circumstances and how much money we have spent so far on that building.\nThe Assistant Minister for Public Works and Housing (Mr. Mwamzandi): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon. Member keeps on talking to hon. Dr. Misoi, instead of addressing the House through the Chair. Could he be advised to address the Chair?\nMr. Speaker: I have had occasion to ask hon. Members to address the Chair, and not one another across the Floor as that would stop personalising debate. Let us proceed on that line.\nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I was not talking to hon. Dr. Misoi. I was just looking at him because he was once the Chairman of the Public Investments Committee, and he could be in a position to tell us what happened.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, we also want to know about the money that was used to buy Bruce House by the National Social Security Fund (NSSF). How was the contract entered into, and how much money was used to buy the NSSF building in Mombasa? How was Mugoya Construction Company given this controversial contract by the NSSF?\nThe Assistant Minister for Public Works and Housing (Mr. Mwamzandi): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This Motion is very clear, and the hon. Member is introducing other matters which are irrelevant to the Motion. Could he be asked to stick to the Motion?\nMr. Speaker: I would like to bring to the attention of hon. Kiliku the rule on relevance. I would like him to look at the wording of this Motion and be relevant to the terms.\nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am just describing how workers have qualified to be the slaves of "grabioses" in this country. You cannot talk about establishing a social security bank which will be in a position to give loans to workers without the availability of money. If  worker\'s money continues to be mismanaged, by the time this bank is established, there will be no money at all.\nThis is no time for covering "godfathers" nor for "godfatherhood". Through you, I would like to tell hon. Mwamzandi that he does not have to rely on "godfathers" because this is the time for speaking the truth.\nThe Assistant Minister for Public Works and Housing (Mr. Mwamzandi): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Member in order to insinuate that I am covering a "godfather"? I do not understand that. Am I not just representing the Government here?\nMr. Speaker: For the good flow of debate, hon. Members, let us leave aside everything personal that is insinuated and proceed with debate.\nMr. Kiliku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Assistant Minister is taking down notes, he should mark that we want to know why when retired people go to the NSSF do not get their money. \nS1BHN06K\nQUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE\nMR. KANGWANA\'S WHEREABOUTS \nMr. Shamalla: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister of State, Office of the President, the following Question by Private Notice.\n(a) Has the Government withdrawn Mr. Jared Kangwana\'s Passport?\n(b) If the answer to (a) is in the affirmative, why was the passport withdrawn?\n(c) Can the Minister furnish the House with Mr. Kangwana\'s whereabouts?\nThe Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Awori): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\n(a) Yes, the Government has withdrawn the Kenya passport previously issued to Mr. Kangwana.\n(b) The passport was withdrawn for well founded reasons.\n(c) I am not aware of Mr. Kangwana\'s whereabouts. If Mr. Kangwana is out of the country he must have travelled clandestinely, and the Government cannot, therefore, know where, when or how he left the country.\nMr. Shamalla: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question is not whether the reasons for the withdrawal of the passport are valid or not. The question is what those reasons are because Mr. Kangwana is nor ordinary person especially as far as Kanu is concerned. Would the Assistant Minister tell us why the passport was withdrawn and where Mr. Kangwana is?\nMr. Awori: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Government does not have to give the reasons why a passport is withdrawn. Secondly, we don\'t know where Mr. Kangwana is.\nMr. Wamalwa: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wanted to raise a point of order. Is the Assistant Minister in order to mislead the House that the Government does not have to give reasons or answers as to why a passport has been withdrawn? Whereas this may be so vis-a-vis the passport holder, I think the Government has a duty to give reasons to this Parliament.\nMr. Awori: Mr. Speaker, Sir, for the purpose of the security of the nation, the Government can choose to withhold the reasons on why a passport has been withdrawn.\nMr. Shikuku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from that absurd reply, will the Assistant Minister agree with me that in the past we had Questions in the House, and I was one of the Members asking them, on the whereabouts of the late J.M. Kariuki. We were treated to the same thing as what we are seeing today. Does the Assistant Minister know that he is responsible to tell this House, and the Nation, the whereabouts of any single citizen of this country? That is his job and he should not pretend otherwise.\nMr. Awori: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is believed that Mr. Kangwana could be doing business in South Africa but that has not been officially confirmed. Since freedom of movement is guaranteed by the Kenyan Constitution, there was no way in which the security personnel could trail Mr. Kangwana everywhere he goes nor stop him from leaving the country clandestinely.\nMr. Kairu: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In view of the conflicting reports regarding Mr. Kangwana\'s disappearance, could the Assistant Minster confirm to this House whether it is true that all his businesses have been taken away and that led to his disappearance?\nMr. Awori: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have no idea of anyone having taken away Mr. Kangwana\'s businesses.\nMr. Ogur: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir,. This House wishes to ask the Assistant Minister to look for Mr. Kangwana and let it know whether he is detained, in hospital, or anywhere in the world, alive or dead.\nMr. Awori: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have just mentioned that it is believed that Mr. Kangwana is doing businesses in South Africa.\nMr. Obwocha: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Finally, you have seen Mr. Kangwana\'s tribesman. This is a very sad affair yet the Assistant Minister is taking it very casually. Just as the hon. Member has said, Mr. Kangwana is not an ordinary man, he is even a friend of the Vice-President of this Republic and his Member of Parliament, hon. Nyachae knows him. Despite all this the Assistant Minister stand up and tells the nation that he does not know where Mr. Kangwana is or that he might have gone to South Africa, when he knows very well that they took his passport away. This is very sad! Can the Assistant Minister tell this House whether Mr. Kangwana is in jail, dead or alive?\nMr. Awori: Mr. Speaker, Sir, under our Constitution, there are no ordinary or special people. All people are equal.\nDr. Kopyo: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. You heard the Assistant Minister say that it is believed that Mr. Kangwana fled to South Africa. What I would like to know is where his source of speculation arises from. \nMr. Speaker: You should have asked a supplementary question.\nMr. Wamae: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we all know that Mr. Kangwana was an Executive of <+_the> Trans-National Bank of Kenya. We now know that this Bank is having a lot of trouble. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has ordered it closed down like any other political banks. Would it be in order to ask the Assistant Minister to get some information on Mr. Kangwana from his partners at Trans-National Bank?\nMr. Awori: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if it is the wish of the House that I should ask the Trans- National Bank staff the whereabouts of Mr. Kangwana, I will most certainly do so and bring the answer here.\nMr. Kapten: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. In 1975, we were told that Mr. J.M. kariuki was in Zambia when he was dead. We are now being told that Mr. Kangwana  maybe><+_may be> in South Africa. We are not sure of that. Can the Assistant Minister give us some of the reasons why Mr. Kangwana\'s passport was withdrawn. Is it because Mr. Kangwana had refused to sell the Kenya Television Network (KTN) to some top Government officials in this Country?\nMr. Awori: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is news to me.\nMr. Speaker: Let us move on to the next Question by Private Notice by hon. Kiliku. I am sorry it is Mr. Kituyi\'s Question and not Mr. Kiliku\'s. I do not have my glasses on. That is why I cannot read the correct name.\nMr. Mulusya: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. With due respect to the chair. We have noticed that you have a problem with your eyesight. Can you get proper glasses so that you can identify correctly the names of the hon. Members?\nMr. Speaker: Order! This is the most frivolous point of order, I have ever heard and although I have denied hon. Mulusya the indignity of being sent out of the House in the past, I will now give him that honour. I am now asking him to leave the Chamber. \nHon. Members: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.\nMr. Speaker: Order! There will be no further points of order.\nHARASSMENT OF MEMBERS \nDr. Kituyi: Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister of State, Office of the President the following Question by Private Notice.\n(a) Is the Minister aware that Honourable Members who have to pass through Burnt Forest on their way to and from their constituencies are regularly subjected to harassment, humiliation and delays at the multiple road blocks where they are forced to identify themselves and other occupants of their cars and their persons, and cars are searched by police officers?\n(b) When will this infuriating harassment come to an end?\nThe Assistant Minister of State, Office of the President (Mr. Sunkuli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\n(a) Burnt Forest is within an area which the Government has declared to be a security operational zone and as such, all persons and their cars passing through there are required to identify themselves. However, immediately one identifies himself he is allowed to pass without any delay harassment or humiliation.\n(b) No harassment as alleged by the Questioner has been reported to the police.\nDr. Kituyi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I like the honesty of some of these answers even when they do not make sense, even when we are told that persons and their cars have to identify themselves. That answer has come from a learned Assistant Minister. If a *mwananchi> told us that he was being subjected to harassment we might have some doubts about this. When the Government is now telling hon. Members that they are not experiencing what they normally experience every week what do they expect?\nThere are three hon. Members who have been with me and subjected to this harassment including being escorted for more than a hundred  kilometres by police escorts to make sure that they do not stop on the road between Nakuru and beyond Eldoret. This Government must tell us clearly if it can do this kind of thing to hon. Members what can stop it from harassing the common *mwananchi> like those who are being raped in Kikuyu?\nMr. Sunkuli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, you realise that hon. Kituyi has not asked any question. If he is learned enough to know that people should not identify themselves, he should be learned enough to know that he can take legal recourse if he has any complaints. What we are saying is that these are total rumours.\nMr. A.S. Ahmed: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope that by now every hon: Member of Parliament has realised that the Government\'s powerful birds of prey are everywhere, even in the National Assembly. Civil servants have a chance since they stand somewhere in the channel of authority. \nAn hon. Member: Ask your question!\nMr. A.S. Ahmed: I am building up my question!\nMr. A.S. Ahmed: Mr. Speaker, Sir, one thing that I would like to know from the hon. Assistant Minister is: According to the Government, what is the position of a Member Of Parliament in the channel of authority?\nMr. Sunkuli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, a Member of Parliament is a Member of the Kenyan Legislature, created by the Kenyan Constitution.\nDr. Kituyi: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to allege that Members of Parliament must carry Identity Cards when they travel beyond Burnt Forest, along the main road from Mombasa to Kampala?\nMr. Sunkuli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, hon. Dr. Kituyi is putting words into my mouth, although he should be advised, of course, to carry his Identity Card. But I think that hon. Members, and every other Kenyan citizens, should identify themselves.\nMr. Kombo: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Following that dishonest answer, and since I am a victim of this harassment, could the Assistant Minister tell us whether this country is, in fact, a police State to justify harassment of people on an international highway from Nairobi to Kampala? Unless we are a police State, we should not go through this kind of harassment. Can he confirm whether or not we are now a police State?\nMr. Sunkuli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, needless to say, we are, of course, not a police State. But I want to make it clear that everybody, including myself and other Ministers, must identify themselves, and as soon as they have done so, they can pass through Burnt Forest. It is also important to add that when hon. Members require the Government to put security measures to areas that are prone to insecurity, that is the price you pay.\nHon. Members: On a point of order! On a point of order!\nMr. Speaker: Order! Last one on that, Mr. Nyagah!\nMr. Nyagah: Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Arising from the Assistant Minister\'s---\nMr. J.N. Mungai: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.\nMr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Nyagah! There is a point of order from Mr. J.N. Mungai.\nMr. J.N. Mungai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, since the regulations which were gazetted by the President concerning the areas that were sealed off for security operations have never been brought to this House for discussions, and the period that they were supposed to be brought in this House expired---\nS1BHN07K\nQUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE \nDEATH OF MS. IMIRE \nProf. Anyang´ Nyong´o: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation, the following Question by Private Notice:-\n(a) Could the Minister explain the circumstances which led to the death of Ms. Violet Imali Imire of the University of Mysore in India a few days ago?\n(b)  Has the Government established who killed Ms. Imire and if so, what further steps is the Government taking regarding this tragic incident?\nThe Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation (Dr. Manduku): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. It pains me to make public in this manner the events which led to the death of a Kenyan student in India. It would have been my wish to confine the death to family members only.\n(a) Ms. Violet Imali Imire, in the company of other Kenyan students, attended a birthday party on the night of 6th November, 1993 and at 3.00 a.m. Violet and a friend borrowed another friend\'s key and left for his house where they intended to spend the night. It is reported that an argument took place between Violet and her *boy-friend> at the house. The *boy-friend> then went outside to lock his scooter and on return, he found Violet on fire. Information available shows that he tried to save her and was burned in the process and rushed to hospital. Police and other people connected in the investigation, concluded that the death was not by misdeed or crime. According to the post-mortem reports the deceased sustained third degree burns of 95% extent. She died from asphyxia as a result of inhalation of flames and irrespirable gases of combustion. The report concludes that the nature and extent of burns are of a typical suicidal case.\n(b) The evidence available indicates that she died from self-demolition and, therefore, the Indian police cannot arrest and charge anyone.\nProf. Anyang´ Nyong´o: Arising from the answer given by the Assistant Minister, it equally pains me to raise this matter in this House, hardly one or two months since I asked a question concerning the rather tragic loss of lives in India of Kenyan students of unusually large proportion compared to the population of Kenyan students abroad. India is a very worrying situation.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I hope you will give me time to give more details about the loss of Ms. Violet Imali Imire and a very inadequate report given by the Indian police, and rather unprofessional conclusions arrived at by the forensic doctor in India. Ms. Imire died on the night of 6th November as explained by the Assistant Minister. But she had no personal history of suicidal tendencies. The evidence collected by the Indian police does not include any statement given by those close to Ms. Imire except her so-called boyfriend. Her roommate Ms. Bakari did not make any statements nor did her immediate friends. The boyfriend did not make any statement. The statements were made by other individuals other than those who could have known Ms. Imire closely. I would also like to state here that the post-mortem---\nMr. Speaker: Order, Prof. Anyang´ Nyong´o The question here is: could the Minister explain the circumstances which led to the death of Ms. Imire? You are now explaining. I wonder if you have taken the role of the Minister. Could you put your question?\nProf. Anyang´ Nyong´o: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I could put the question, but I can only put it if I give the necessary background to the Assistant Minister, which he has ignored. The Assistant Minister refers only to the report given by the police and Indian doctors and does not refer to the post-mortem done at the University of Nairobi which raises the following questions which I would like him to respond to.\nManner of death - this should be investigated further. There are many disturbing omissions from the post-mortem and forensic report in India. \nI will try to list the items which should be explained. \nMr. Speaker: Order, may I again remind you that you cannot make a question the basis of a debate.\nProf. Anyang´ Nyong´o: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the questions are as follows. Could the Minister respond to the following questions raised by the post-mortem report at the University of Nairobi, which cast doubts regarding the circumstances under which Ms. Imire died? The following are the questions:\n1) There are no statements from the alleged boyfriend, Raymond, nor the owner of the house, nor Mr. Robert Bwibo.\n2) There is no toxicology report - the post-mortem in Nairobi would have expected alcohol blood level and carbon-monoxide blood level. A person who was at a party and died of burns needed this kind of examination. \n3) Robert saw the black plastic---\nMr. Speaker: Order, hon. Member. I have shown a lot of tolerance because a Kenyan child died abroad and I hoped that you would press for action from the Assistant Minister. You know the basic rules that you ask one question at a time. Can you ask one question at a time and then you will give other Members a chance to assist you in pressing for action?\nProf. Anyang´ Nyong´o: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will ask one question at a time. The question is this: Can the Assistant Minister explain from the point of view of the second post-mortem done in Nairobi, whether or not he is satisfied with the statement he got from India and whether or not, those statements do indeed explain the real circumstances under which this lady died?\nDr. Manduku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have two post-mortem reports. One report was done immediately after the death of Ms. Imire and another report was done in Nairobi by a Nairobi pathologist, Dr. Aggrey Nyong´o, presumably a brother to the questioner which, however, does not matter. The report given by the doctors in India proved that this lady died of severe burns that she inflicted on herself or otherwise, burns of 95% extent. That is a complete burn of the whole body, because literally there was no skin left. Definitely under such circumstances there is nothing you can do other than have a very explicit cause of death. After the body had been brought back to Kenya a Kenyan doctor, Dr. Aggrey Nyong´o, looked at the body and raised these questions which are very, very obvious; that the real cause of death was severe burns.\nProf. Anyang´ Nyong´o: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not disputing the fact that the cause was by burning. \nBut I am disputing the conclusion by the Indian doctor and the Indian police that it was suicide. This is because the dramatic persona in this case are highly suspect. The Assistant Minister is not reading to this House the questions raised by Dr. Nyong´o, a Nairobi Pathologist, regarding the conclusions reached in India. What is happening in India is of great concern to this nation. When somebody dies of burns, it does not <&/>grammar necessary mean that they have committed suicide; somebody else could have burnt them. In this circumstance, I concur with my brother that there is suspicion of murder in India which is being covered up by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation and the Indian authorities.\nDr. Manduku: There is nothing being covered up here, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Indian police have done investigations and we are telling the House what the Indian Police and authorities did.\nDr. Otieno-Kopiyo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, hon. Prof. Nyong´o asked the Assistant Minister a question. The hon. Assistant Minister has stated categorically that these people who were supposed to be in the know did not make any statements to the police. He also says he is satisfied with that. Is he not contradicting an obvious thing?\nMr. Speaker: Order, Dr. Otieno-Kopiyo! Are you putting the question to me or to the Assistant Minister?\nDr. Otieno-Kopiyo: I heard and suppose you also heard; that the lady\'s boyfriend did not make a statement to the police. Also the people in the neighbourhood were not questioned by the police. Obviously, therefore, the conclusions reached by the Indian Police were inadequate and misleading.\nMr. Speaker: What is your response, Dr. Manduku?\nDr. Manduku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Indian police recorded statements from several people who were around that vicinity. They recorded a statement from one Shailaja Kriparidi ---\nAn Hon. Member: <_ea>Huyo ni Mhindi!\nDr. Manduku: This is a neighbour of Robert. Robert is the owner of the house in which Raymond and Irene had gone to stay overnight. She went near the house and saw Raymond whose left hand had severe burns. He was screaming for help. Shailaja also saw flames coming from the kitchen. With <+_the> help of neighbours, the fire was put out.\nMr. Speaker: I do not think we have the time to have all that disposition read from the Table. You ma y choose to lay the document on the Table.\nDr. Maduku: What I am trying to say, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is that statements were recorded from people who were around during the death of this girl. So, it should not be assumed that nothing has been done in terms of investigations.\nMr. Nthenge: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when you are investigating something about a person you go and question the people who are close to that person. But you will find that the student\'s room mates and others who were always close to the student who died were never questioned. Why were they not questioned by the Indian Police?\nAn Hon. Member: And especially the boyfriend.\nDr. Manduku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that is exactly what I was explaining but you told me to stop. There were very many other people, including the boyfriend, who were questioned by the police.\nProf. Anyang Nyong´o: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have the police report from India; Raymond was never questioned; Miss Bakari was never questioned; Richard was never questioned.\nAn Hon. Member: Why?\nProf. Anyang Nyong´o: Mr. Speaker, Sir, why these people are only given first names and not last names is also questionable. This nation must order a proper inquest into the death of this lady. \nDr. Manduku: Mr. Speaker, Sir, may I suggest that if there are any other people the Questioner wants to be questioned regarding the death he should give their names to us and we pass them on to Indian authorities and investigations will be carried out still.\nMr. Speaker: We must move on to the next Question.\nMr. Magwaga: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the Assistant Minister in order to evade the question being raised by the Questioner. Why were these people, who were close friends of the deceased, not questioned?\nMr. Speaker: Order! I have already called the next question.\nREPAIRS TO ROAD (B7) \nMr. Muoki: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minster for Public Works and housing the following Question by Private Notice.\n(a) Is the Minister aware that there are impassable sections along the Kibwezi-Kitui Road (B7) during the current rainy season? \n(b) What urgent plans does the Minister have to murram these impassable sections of this road, given that the current rains have cut off residents of this area from the rest of the country?\nThe Minister of Public Works and Housing (Prof. Ng´eno): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply. \n(a) I am aware that there are impassable sections along the Kibwezi-Kitui Road (B7) during the current rainy season\n(b) The Ministry plans to gravel this road as soon as possible; especially the sections which are impassable.\nMr. Muoki: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this road has been impassable for the last three days. I am urging the Minister to take urgent steps to ensure that the road becomes passable and he says he is trying his best. Can the Minister assure this House that he is going to take immediate action to correct the situation?\nS1BHN08K\nORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS \nRELEASE OF ACCIDENT DRIVER \nMr. Oneko asked the Minister of State, Office of the President:-\n(a) whether he is aware that on 16th December, 1992, at 9.00 p.m. in Naivasha, an accident occurred involving a car registration No. KAC 376Q and a lorry registration No. KUT 890, and that the driver of the lorry was arrested by the Naivasha police; and\n(b) if the answer to (a) is in the affirmative, why the lorry driver was later released without any charges being preferred against him.\nThe Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. ole Sunkuli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to *reply.d>\n(a) Yes, I am aware.\n(b) The lorry driver was not released as suggested by the hon. Questioner but was charged with the offence of using a motor vehicle on the road with all parts and equipment thereof not maintained in good working order, contrary to Section 55(1) of the Traffic Act (Cap 403) of the laws of Kenya, as per Naivasha Traffic Charge Register No. 1694/93 and Court File No. 2345 of 1993. The matter is pending before court, hence is sub-judice.\nMr. Speaker: Next Question.\nMr. Mulusya: Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I ask this Question, I wish to point out that I have not been supplied with a written reply.\nFUNDS FOR KANGUNDO NYAYO WARDS \nMr. Mulusya asked the Minister of State, Office of the President:-\n(a) how much money was collected from the members of the public for the construction of Kangundo Nyayo Wards;\n(b) where the money is banked and who the signatories to the bank accounts are; and\n(c) when the money is likely to be utilised for the purpose for which it was collected.\nThe Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. ole Sunkuli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have submitted a copy of the written answer to the Clerk\'s Office.\nHaving said that, I beg to reply.\n(a) A total of KShs. 3,461,308 was collected for Kangundo Nyayo Wards.\n(b) The money is banked in four banking institutions, and the amounts banks, account numbers and their signatories are as follows:-\n1. Kenya Commercial Bank, Moi Avenue, Nairobi. The account No. is 93/12/89 and the amount banked there is KShs. 1 million. The signatories are Mr. Elijah Kithimba, Hon. Justice M.G. Mulli, Mr. Charles Songa and Mr. Mueke Nguli. The account is operated by the Nairobi Steering Committee.\n2. Kenya Commercial Bank, Tala Branch. The account No. is 165054131 and the amount banked is KShs. 1,570,308. The signatories are the District Officer, Kangundo, Mr. J.M. Ngutu, Hon. Justice M.G. Mulli and Mr. N.M. Kyengo.\n3. Kenya Commercial Finance Company Ltd., Nairobi, Moi Avenue. The account No. is 017641/91/1561 and the amount banked is KShs. 852,168.20. The signatories are District Officer Kangundo, Mr. J.M. Ngutu, Mr.\nN.M. Kyengo and Hon. Justice M.G. Mulli. The account is operated by the main Nyayo Wards Committee.\n4. Delphis Bank, Nkrumah Road, Mombasa. The account No. is 02060913 and the amount banked is KShs. 103,000. The signatories are Mr. Bernard Mutiso and Mr. Constance.\n(c) The work is already in progress. The X-ray unit work is completed while building materials are delivered on site on a daily basis. The ground breaking ceremony was done on 24th July, 1993.\nMr. Mulusya: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister is naturally a very good man, but he is either trying to cover somebody on a fraud which has already been committed or he has been misled. I have with me here some papers which I want to lay on the Table, which show a discrepancy of more than KShs. 2 million from that account, which has never been audited. In his attempt to hide the truth, the hon. Justice Guy Mulli decided, instead ---\nMr. Speaker: Order, hon. Mulusya! Right now you should know the provisions of Standing Order No. 73. You shall not talk adversely against any judge in this House.\nMr. Mulusya: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what I want to produce here is evidence to show that there is a cover up of a fraud. I have been given by the said judge, who is a member of the Nyayo Wards Committee, some bank reconciliation statements which do not tally and which lack simple mathematical ---\nMr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Mulusya! You are making a speech and not asking a question.\nMr. Mulusya: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if you may allow me to hand over these documents to the Assistant Minister ---\nMr. Speaker: Yes, do that.\nMr. Mulusya: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am tabling these papers and, in the process of doing so, what I have in front of me indicates that in the month of ---\nMr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Mulusya! You know the Standing Orders that a question shall not be made the pretext for debate. If you want to Table any document, I have given you the opportunity to do so. Once you have done that and if you have any further questions to put to the Assistant Minister, go ahead and do so.\nMr. Boy: You are a <ea/>mtumba!\nMr. Mulusya: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Juma Boy in order --\nMr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Mulusya! Mr. Mulusya, you had asked your Question from the Back Bench, you then moved from there to the Front Bench to Table the documents that you had and you should just do that then proceed to your original position and ask your question from there.\nAn Hon. Member: Mr. Mulusya was in the process of framing his question.\nMr. Speaker: I will now give him the last chance to make up his mind whether he wants to ask a question or not.\nMr. Mulusya: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to ask a question. The documents I have Tabled show a discrepancy of more than KShs. 2 million plus interest. Is the hon. Assistant Minister prepared to come to this House with bank statements showing withdrawals and deposits and also hold a probe into the accounts of Kangundo Nyayo Wards?\nMr. Sunkuli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with due respect to the hon. Member, we have not been informed which of the four accounts listed here has the said discrepancy. But I will definitely take it upon myself to ensure that the accounts are audited as usual and discrepancies will be dealt with in the normal way.\nMr. Obwocha: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell this House why this Kangundo Nyayo Wards Committee was operating four different accounts? What was the reason for operating four different accounts some as far places as Mombasa?\nMr. Sunkuli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the monies for Kangundo Nyayo Wards were raised from members of the public and the accounts were operated by different steering committees by persons resident within different places. Those who were residing in Nairobi were operating an account in Nairobi while those residing in Mombasa and Tala were operating accounts in those towns.\nMr. Nthenge: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the purpose of collecting this money was to put up Nyayo Wards in Kangundo. Could the Assistant Minister tell the House why this was not done and when it will be done?\nMr. Sunkuli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when answering part (c) of the Question I said, and I wish to repeat, that the work is already in progress. The X-ray Unit works is completed while building materials are delivered on the site on a daily basis. The work is going on.\nMr. Mulusya: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is the hon. Assistant Minister in order to mislead the House that provision of an X-ray Unit was part of the Nyayo Wards Project when he knows clearly that this unit was supposed to be supplied to Kangundo Hospital in 1988 but it was diverted to Kathiani Hospital when it was completed?\nMr. Speaker: What is the point of order there, Mr. Mulusya?\nMr. Mulusya: He is misleading the House.\nMr. Speaker: Go ahead and respond, Mr. Sunkuli.\nMr. Sunkuli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, whether or not this unit was diverted, is the hon. Member suggesting that Kangundo Nyayo Wards is not supposed to have an X-ray Unit?\nMr. Speaker: Next Question.\nREGISTRATION OF STUDENTS \nMr. Ndilinge asked the Minister for Education:-\n(a) whether he is aware that over 45 students of Kitaingo Secondary School have not been registered for this year\'s KCSE Examinations; and\n(b) if the answer to part (a) is in the affirmative, whether he could ensure that the students are registered so that they sit for the said examination.\nThe Assistant Minister for Education (Mr. Lengees): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\nI am aware that 45 students of Kitaingo Secondary School had not been registered for this year\'s KCSE Examination. However, steps have been taken and 44 students have now been registered for KCSE except for one student, Master Mukeku Justus Mutiso, who has not been registered due to non-payment of the examination fees.\nMr. Ndilinge: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating that reply, could the Assistant Minister assure this House that this mistake will not be repeated in future?\nAn Hon. Member: Sema "Yes, Sir."\nMr. Lengees: Yes, Sir.\nMr. Mutahi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House the reason why there was a delay in registering these students?\nMr. Lengees: Mr. Speaker, Sir, all the students paid the examination fees on time but the headmaster who was there then went away with the money.\nMr. Ndilinge: Could the Assistant Minister tell the House whether plans are under-way to register the one student who was left out?\nMr. Lengees: Mr. Speaker, Sir, there is still time to register the student as long as he pays the required fees and depending on the subjects he is to take. The last date for registration was 31st May and some subjects like Agriculture and Home Science have already been taken but he can still pay for the rest of the subjects.\nDr. Otieno-Opiyo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if I heard the Assistant Minister correctly, he said that the students actually paid for the examinations but the headmaster took off with the money. He is now saying that these students should pay again? Which is which? Have they or have they not paid?\nMr. Lengees: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I said earlier, 44 students have already paid except for one student who did not pay for various reasons.\nMr. Speaker: Next Question.\nFOOD PLANT AT MITUNGUU \nMr. Speaker: Mr. Murungi is not in? Next Question.\nOPERATION OF HEALTH CENTRE \nMr. Speaker: Mr. Ruhiu is not in? Next Question.\nBILLING OF TOWN RESIDENTS \nMr. Speaker: Dr. Lwali-Oyondi is not? Next Question.\nGRADING OF SABURU-DOLA ROAD \nMr. Rai asked the Minister for Public Works and Housing when the Ministry will grade the Samburu-Silaloni-Mnago wa Dola Road in Kinango Division which is currently in a poor condition.\nThe Assistant Minister for Public Works (Mrs. Mwendwa): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\nThe road will be graded between mid-August and the end of September this year. I think it has already been graded.\nMr. Rai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I appreciate the concern shown by the Assistant Minister because work on parts of this road has been done. So, I want some assurance from her as to whether something will be done on the other part of the road, because when the rains come then the road will be impassable.\nDr. Otieno-Opiyo: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Assistant Minister said work on the road has been done and no further question on it arises. So, is hon. Rai raising another Question under the pretext of the supplementary question?\nMr. Speaker: Order, Dr. Otieno-Opiyo! You know the rule that any hon. Member may on a supplementary question raise all points that are relevant to the original Question. So, the hon. Member is perfectly in order to press for further action. As a consequent of that you are absolutely out of order to try to block him. Proceed, Mrs. Mwendwa!\nS1BHN09K\nQUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE\nDEATH OF LIEUTENANT KIBOBI \nBishop Kimani: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister of State, Office of the President the following Question by Private Notice:-\n(a) What circumstances lead to the death of John Tubei Kibobi, P/No. 21056, on Saturday 1oth July, 1993, while undergoing training at Moi Air Base?\n(b) Why was the deceased\'s mother, a Mrs. Gladys Wanjiku Kibobi, from Ngamini Farm, Subukia, refused entry into her dead son\'s house in the barracks to collect his (deceased\'s) belongings?\nThe Assistant Minster of State, Office of the President (Mr. Manga): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\n(a) The officer was shot dead by a member of the regular Police Force, on 10th July, 1993, at the Kenya Bus Service terminal. It was at the time alleged that the officer was shot for obstructing the policeman during a swoop on hawkers. However, following further investigations, an officer service No.55175, police Constable <name/> has been arrested and charged with murder.\n(b) The deceased\'s mother, a Mrs. Gladys Wanjiku Kibobi, was refused to enter her dead son\'s house in the barracks to collect his belongings, because the Army Board of Enquiry set up in accordance with the Armed Forces Act, had not concluded its work.\nBishop Kimani: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the answer given by the hon. Assistant Minister still leaves to be explained. Lieutenant John Kibobi was trained as a pilot at the Moi Air Force. On 10th July, the very material day he was shot is the same day that the aircraft that crashed at the Kereita Forest was found. Can the Assistant Minister tell this House, what relationship there is between the crash of the aircraft and the shooting of the deceased? Why was his mother refused to collect his belongings if you claim that he was shot outside the barracks?\nMr. Manga: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have said that the mother was refused to collect the belongings because investigations had not been concluded. That is according to the Armed Forces Act. As regards the accident, I would not know the relationship between the crash and the shooting because he was actually shot by the policeman.\nMr. Magwaga: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am glad that you put on spectacles to enable you to see me. May I find out from the Assistant Minister, whether the mother of the deceased can now collect the property?\nMr. Manga: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the investigations by the Board that was set up is due to be completed in a month\'s time , and then the mother will be allowed to collect the deceased\'s belongings.\nMr. Lwali-Oyondi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell us exactly what time this particular person was shot because, it would appear from the evidence given by the Bishop that he was shot in the evening? Could the Assistant Minister give his version, please?\nMr. Manga: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I want to put the hon. Member right. The Questioner has indicated that the killing has something to do with the accident. So, he did not actually bring out the time. But this happened and it was in the Press, and everybody knows when it happened.\nMr. Speaker: Next Question, Dr. Lwali-Oyondi!\nSWEARING -IN OF DISTRICT COMMISSIONER \nDr. Lwali-Oyondi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Local Government the following Question by Private Notice:-\n(a) Is the Minister aware that the Nakuru District Commissioner has been taking part in council meetings without having been sworn in as an ex-officio Municipal Council Member?\n(b) Is he further aware that the said District Commissioner has been ordering the cancellation of council meetings, despite his legal handicap?\n(c) If the answer to (b) is in the affirmative, could the Minister tell the House where the District Commissioner gets "locus standi" in deciding when the Council meetings have to take place?\nThe Assistant Minister for Local Government (Mr: Walji): Mr. Speaker, Sir, beg to reply. \n(a) I am not aware that the DC is interfering with the Municipal Council of Nakuru.\n(b) The DC of Nakuru has never ordered the cancellation of any Council meeting.\n(c) The DC has never, at any time, decided the timing of the Council meetings. This is entirely the responsibility of the Council itself. \nDr. Lwali-Oyondi: Arising from the answer given, a copy of which I did not even get, the Assistant Minister is misleading the House because, first of all, the DC has never been sworn-in up to now. Secondly, the DC cancelled the meeting on 14th of May 1993 which was supposed to discuss the breakage and stealing goods from the kiosks and the---\nMr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Lwali-Oyondi! Will you ask you question or, I let you say a few words then I go to the next question?\nDr. Lwali-Oyondi: Yes, please. I am asking whether the Assistant Minister is in order to mislead the House in view of the facts that I have already put forward? \nMr. Walji: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to remind the hon. Member Dr. Lwali-Oyondi, that if he wants to live in the lake, then he should not fight with the fish because the fish will eat him! The DC was officially sworn-in on the 5th of August 1993 and also, he is Chairman of the Security Committee. If he finds that, that particular meeting was a risk at any time, then he would cancel the meeting. So, why fight with the fish?\nMr. Shikuku: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Arising from that intimidating statement by the Assistant Minister, who finds pleasure in talking about the "big fish" eating somebody, is he aware that in his first reply, he said that he was not aware, now he says if the DC feels there is  security problem, he has the right to cancel the meeting, which I think is true? What security is needed for a Council to meet inside the Council? It was not a public rally!\nMr. Walji: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question was; "Is the Minister aware that the Nakuru DC has been talking part in Council meetings without having been sworn-in as an ex-officio Municipal Council Member? And I said I am not aware because he was already an ex-officio Member of the Council and he was sworn-in on 5th August 1993. If the said meeting was cancelled, then it must have been a security risk. \nRUINING OF FISHING INDUSTRY \n(Mr. Ogur): to ask the Minister for Tourism and Wildlife the following Question by Private Notice:-\n(a) Is the Minister aware that there are fish trawlers operating in Mohuru Bay and Karungu Bay in the Nyatike Constituency section of Lake Victoria and ruining the young fish at an alarming rate, and that threatens the extinction of a certain breed of fish within three months?\n(b) If the answer to (a) is in the affirmative, what action is the Minister planning to take to save the situation?\nRAPE THREAT TO MS. ANYANZWA \n(Ms. Karua) to ask the Attorney-General the following Question by Private Notice:-\n(a) Is the Attorney-General aware that Tigoni Police in September, 1993, threatened to rape the Secretary-General of the Anti-Rape Organization, Ms. Fatuma Anyanzwa, while she was in her custody?\n(b) Has the Attorney-General directed investigations with a view to prosecuting the concerned officers?\nMr. Speaker: Order! Order, hon. Members!\nFor lack of time, Question No. 3 by Private Notice by hon. Ochola Ogur and Question No. 4 by Private Notice by hon. Martha Karua, will be deferred to Thursday afternoon. I do sympathise with them and I hope they do understand. That ends Question Time now.\nNext Order.\nNOTICE OF MOTION FOR ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE\nENOOSUPUKIA LAND CLASHES \nMr. Odinga: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I beg to move the following Motion:\nTHAT, this House do adjourn for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of National Importance, namely; the Land Clashes in Enoosupukia Location, Narok District, Rift Valley Province.\nMr. Speaker: Order! Do I understand that you want to raise that matter under Standing Order No. 20, or which one?\nMr. Odinga: Under Standing Order No. 20.\nMr. Speaker: Very well, then. I do agree that the matter is urgent, I also agree that it is of national importance and that it is specific. The House will understand, and I hope, you, Mr. Odinga, will also understand, that we cannot interrupt the time set for the Committee of Supply, between now and 6:30 p.m. Possibly, i will allow you to move that Motion---\nOrder! I am sorry. I find that your matter meets the conditions stated by Standing Order No. 20, subject to the House\'s approval, if you have support.\nWell, it is apparent, you have support. You do have support, hon. Odinga. I cannot interfere with the business of the House on a day set for the Committee of Supply, between 3:30 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. I will allocate your time between 6:30p.m. and 7:30 p.m., this evening. Next Order!\nCOMMITTEE OF SUPPLY\nMOTION\nTHAT MR. SPEAKER DO NOW LEAVE THE CHAIR \nVote 14 - Ministry of Transport and Communications\nThe Minister of Transport and Communication (Mr. Otieno): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, allow me to open my remarks by paying tribute to His Excellency President Daniel Toroitich arap Moi. For his exemplary leadership of this country in general and, of my Ministry in particular. It is through his dedication, guidance and advice that this country is implementing difficult political and economic reforms, all concurrently with good success.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, the Vote of the Ministry of Transport  and Communications requires a sum of KSh.21,096,460, broken down between Recurrent Expenditure R.14 of KSh.18,456,220 and Vote D.14; Development Expenditure of KSh.2,640,240.\nMr. Ogur: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The Minister is moving a very important Motion. Although some of us in our areas have never seen their home areas telephones, you can see how hon. Members are behaving when the Minister is moving the Motion. This is discourteous and I will ask the Chair to intervene because some of us want to listen to what the Minister is saying.\nMr. Speaker: Order! I would like to bring to the attention of the House especially those who have not got the grasp of the Standing Orders up to now the fact that when  a hon. Member is on a point of order, he should not be interrupted through another point of order. Hon. members should always be patient until  a hon. member is through with his point of order and then they can rise on points of order. Some hon. members  maybe><+_may be> a little impatient, but the rules must be followed. Hon. Minister, proceed.\nThe Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr. Otieno): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am asking for KSh.18,466,220 for the Recurrent Estimates Expenditure which does not include KSh.1.56 million Appropriations-in-Aid. My Ministry is charged with the responsibility of ensuring that transport and communications in this country are properly managed and developed. In this connection, my Ministry operates through various departments and State Corporations which include the following:-\nThe Departments at the Meteorological Department\nThe Directorate of Civil Aviation\nThe Civil Aviation Board\nThe Road Transport Branch\nMr. Speaker, Sir, as most hon. Members know, the state Corporations under my Ministry include the Kenya Airways and its subsidiaries, the Kenya Flamingo Airways Limited and the Kenya Air Freight Handling Services Limited. The Kenya Ports Authority has also two subsidiaries, the Kenya Ferry Services Limited and the *kenya> National Shipping Line Limited. I also have under my Ministry the Kenya Railways Corporation and the Kenya Ports and Telecommunications Corporations. The funds requested in our recurrent estimates will, therefore, be used for operational activities at the Ministry Headquarters and the respective departments. The provisions will be used to finance payments of personal emoluments; general maintenance of officers, the implementation of the National Road Safety council programme, contributions to international organizations, contributions to the Northern Corridor Secretariat and compensation for the Ferry operations and its maintenance.\nS1BHN10K\nCOMMUNICATIONS FROM THE CHAIR \nWelcome to Swedish Members of Parliament \nMr. Speaker: Non. Members, it is with great pleasure that I welcome, on behalf of the Kenya National Assembly, Members of the Swedish Parliament who are seated in the Speaker\'s Row. \nI will be excused if I do not pronounce their names correctly. They are:\nMr. Bertile Fiskesjoe - Third Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee on the Constitution;\nMr. Agne Hansson - Chairman of the Standing Committee on Housing;\nMr. Bengt Kindbom - Member of the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare; and \nMrs. Rosa Oesth - Member of the Standing Committee on Health and Welfare.\nThey are in Kenya to visit various projects and programmes funded by the Swedish Government and to witness the working of the  Kenyan political system. They are accompanied by their spouses and an official from the Swedish Embassy. \nOn our behalf, I wish them a pleasant stay in Kenya.\nThank you.\nPETITION: THE CHAIR TO MAKE CONSIDERED RULING \nMr. Speaker: Are you laying a paper?\nMr. Ndubai: It is a petition, Sir.\nMr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Ndubai! I think you have been in consultation with the staff of this House in respect of your intended petition. Until you have been advised, pleased, bear with us, Mr. Ndubai!\nMr. Ndubai: But, Mr. Speaker, Sir ---\nMr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Ndubai! I will bring to your attention the fact that hon. Members have a right to air their views and they also have a right to present all matters to this National Assembly so long as they are in accordance with the law of the land and the Standing Orders.\nI have had occasion in the past to advise this particular hon. Member on a matter that he brought up and after proper advice, he was able to give notice of his intended Motion. Even now, what we are asking the hon. Member is to allow the Chair and the staff of the national Assembly to look at the matter that he intends to bring and see whether it is in conformity with the procedure and the law that relates to the bringing of petitions here.\nI may also bring to the attention of the House the fact that to the best of my recollection, in the very short time that I looked at the history of petitions, the last time such a thing was ever presented to this Parliament was in 1955. I have not had another occasion to look at what the contents of the petition are, how it is framed, and how it is presented. \nFor the benefit of the House, today and for the future, we would like to do it right. If the House can give that understanding or that tolerance, we will all serve the future of this country much better.\nMr. J.N. Mungai: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. While I abide by your ruling, I wish to ask if I will be in order to seek guidance from the Chair with regard to how long it will take before you give a ruling, and whether such petitions can be raised or not? How long is it going to take?\nMr. Speaker: Order, hon. Members! Hon. Members know that at least for the last 10 months I have been your Speaker -  whenever I have promised to give a ruling on any matter, I take the earliest opportunity to do so. I must not only give a ruling, but I must give a firm ruling that is in keeping with our laws today and with the traditions of this House, and that from which we also borrowed our tradition, that is, the House of Commons, if our precedents and Standing Orders are not precise on the issue. \nThe answer to the hon. Mugai is that I will give a ruling on that in the shortest time humanly possible. \nI think, Mr. Ndubai, I have already ---\nMr. Ndubai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have heard what you have said ---\nMr. Speaker: Mr. Ndubai, I hope you are not revisiting the issue.\nMr. Ndubai: Mr. Speaker, Sir, you should give me an opportunity to explain to you. You have been told by the Clerk what has been happening.\nMr. Speaker: Order! Order!\nMr. Ndubai: Standing Order Nos. 163-167 are very clear on Petitions. There was enough consultation ---\nMr. Speaker: Order, hon. Ndubai! You may have done your homework for a month or so to be able to present your Petition: i am not doubting that. What I am saying is that the Chair has not had the advantage of the time you have had. Because I am the one who is ultimately responsible for matters that are brought into this House , I will have to determine whether it is proper or improper to do so. That is not asking too much. Let us proceed.\nHon. Members: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.\nMr. Speaker: Order! Order! Not on that one. Hon. Members I have given the House an undertaking to make a ruling, and I have said that I will do so as soon as humanly possible. Let us proceed.\nPAPERS LAID \nThe following papers were laid on the Table:-\nSessional Paper No. 3 of 1993 on National Food Policy\n(By the Minister for Agriculture, Livestock Development and Marketing)\nAnnual Report and Accounts of Kenya Ports Authority for the year ended 30th June, 1992 and the Certificate therof by the Auditor-General (Corporations)\n(By the Minister for Agriculture, Livestock Development and Marketing on behalf of the Minister for Transport and Communications)\nThe Annual Report and Accounts of Kenya Bureau of Standards for the year ended 30th June, 1989 and the Certificate thereof by the Auditor-General (Corporations)\n(By the Minister for Agriculture, Livestock Development and Marketing on behalf of the Minister for Commerce and Industry)\nORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS \nMr. Arte: Mr. Speaker, Sir, before I ask this Question on behalf of hon. Leshore, I wish to apologise for his absence from the House.\nMr. Speaker: Mr. Arte, what are you apologising about? Just ask the Question!\nBANDITRY MENACE IN WASO \nMr. Arte, on behalf of Mr. Leshore, asked the Minister of State:-\n(a) whether he is aware of the increasing banditry activities in Waso Division of Shamburu East Constituency, and,\n(b) what arrangements he is making to contain these banditry activities in order to save innocent <ea/>wananchi.\nThe Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Awori): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\n(a) Yes, I am very much aware.\n(b) Security patrols, ambushes and the provision of armed escorts have been intensified in the affected area, like any other part of the country, to contain the situation.\nMr. Arte: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while appreciating this very good answer from the hon. Assistant Minister, since 1992 about 13 raids have been carried out in this area. Despite the fact that the Assistant Minister had earlier on promised in this House that security measures would be taken and that the situation would be under control, this has still not happened. This year alone about five raids have been carried out in this area and one of the victims was a General Service Unit officer, who disappeared and up to now has not been found. Can the Assistant Minister seriously revisit his promises and tell the House what measures he is taking to contain the situation.\nMr. Awori: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I have said we have intensified the various security personnel in the area to try and contain this banditry that is a spill-over from far up north due to the various movements from the neighbouring countries.\nDr. Kituyi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Assistant Minister said that the Government is doing something, as it is doing in other areas of this country, to end this banditry. People from such an area should be very frightened because what the Government is doing in other clashes-affective areas in this country is negative. Can the Assistant Minister tell the house what concrete action the Government is taking to end banditry, apart from general finalities and excusing internal problems on neighbouring countries even when there are problems of banditry and clashes in the area without any bordering countries?\nMr. Awori: Mr Speaker, Sir, this is <+_a> democratic country and Members of Parliament are entitled to their own opinions. I have stated quite clearly that the Government is doing everything within its powers That means increasing the number of security officers and patrols in areas that are affected.\nMr. Farah: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to tell the House that the government is trying to increase the number of security forces, when we know that even if you tell the entire Kenyan armed forces to move to the North Eastern Province they are simply not the right quality of manpower to bring peace in that area? We also know that the more security forces you send to that area to carry out operations, the more innocent people they kill. This has just happened in Wajir, where they killed people - and an Assistant Minister here is a witness of this - instead of following up bandits.\nMr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Farah! That is not a point of order. You have just made a statement which you are not entitled to but I will just let you go; so, you must be happy with me.\nMr. Falana: Mr. Speaker, Sir, banditry in Northern Kenya is quite different from that in any other part of Kenya. When the Assistant Minister talks of intensifying patrols and armed escorts, from experience, I can tell him that this has never worked and it will never work. The only solution to the problem in Northern Kenya is to recruit for security work people from that area. We put that request to the Government because both the killers and the victims are people from Northern Kenya. So, the only solution will be to use security people from Northern Kenya . Would the Government kindly consider recruiting an anti-banditry squad from Northern Kenya? This is because when ---\nMr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Falana! I can understand why you get carried away; I know it is a very sensitive issue. But you know the rule that questions shall not be turned into a debate? Can you let the Assistant Minister respond to what you have said?\nMr. Awori: Mr: Speaker, Sir, the recruitment of personnel, whether security or otherwise, is carried out on merit and not on tribal basis. \nMr. Speaker: Are you on a point of order, Dr. Wako?\nDr. Wako: Mr. Speaker, Sir, mine is not a point of order; I just wanted to tell the Assistant Minister ---\nMr. Speaker: Well, I am sorry for you. I was under the very mistaken belief that you were on a point of order, but since you are not on a point of order, let us hear Mr. Falana.\nMr. Falana: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. This is a very sensitive issue because it involves the lives of Kenyans. Is the Assistant Minister in order to insinuate that I have requested for fresh recruitment from my Oromo community when there are many communities in Northern Kenya? All that we are saying is that we have qualified staff, be it in the Kenya Police or Kenya Army, from Northern Kenya, who only need to be mobilised. <ea_>Usiajiri wengine; tumia wale ambao tayari wako!<ea/>\nMr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Falana! That is not a point of order.\nMr. Shikuku: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I thought I heard the hon. Member address you in English and then, towards the end, he changed to Kiswahili ---\nHon. Members: <ea_>Ahaa! Wacha wewe!<ea/>\nS1BHN11K\nORAL ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS \nPAYMENT OF ELECTION ALLOWANCES \nMr. Kamuyu asked the Minister of State, Office of the President:-\n(a) whether he is aware that the police officers in Nairobi were not paid their allowances like the other officers in provinces during the last multi-party general elections held on 29th December, 1992; and\n(b) if the answer to (a) is in the affirmative, whether he could make immediate arrangements to release such allowances without further delay.\nThe Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Sunkuli): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\n(a) Yes, I am aware.\n(b) I wish to inform the hon. Member that the Accounting Officer has been requested to make arrangements for the payment.\nMr. Kamuyu: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am grateful for the answer the Assistant Minister has given. However, he must know that the police in this country, particularly in Nairobi, are also human beings and one is surprised to note the way they have been let down. They work under bad conditions and lack basic facilities, earning very low salaries at the end of the day and this has continued to frustrate them a great deal. Could he tell the House why it has taken him 10 months to have these officers paid these allowances? Furthermore, could he tell us the total amount to be paid to Nairobi police officers involved in the last general elections? Perhaps he could give a breakdown of the amounts payable by rank?\nMr. Sunkuli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member has asked three questions all at the same time but I will endeavour to answer one at a time. Regarding the amount of money payable to officers in Nairobi, I would like to inform the hon. Member and the House that there has been a delay in the payment. However, we have now got in touch with the Accounting Officer in charge, who is the Clerk of the National Assembly and requested that the police officers be paid Shs. 48 million. There are 11,822 security officers in Nairobi Area who worked during the last general elections and they will all  been paid in due course. \nMr. Kamuyu: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I did hear the Assistant Minister complain that I combined too many questions and I apologise for that. However, I wanted to know how much each officer is getting according to his rank? Can he be kind enough to give the House this information? Could he also tell us when he will release the money?\nMr. Speaker: Mr. Kamuyu, that is not a point of order!\nMr. Kamuyu: On apoint of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.\nMr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Kamuyu! You yourself have already acknowledged the fact that you asked three questions in one go. Unless, you want to raise another supplementary question, let hon. Farah ask his question. If you still want to ask another question you will probably catch my eye to do that.\nMr. Farah: Mr. Speaker, Sir, arising from the Assistant  Minister\'s reply would he not agree with me that the failure to pay the police officers in Nairobi Area their dues, is the reason why they are practising a lot of corruption in Eastleigh among the Somali refugees?\nMr. Sunkuli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I think the hon. Member is confusing two things: We are not talking about payment of salaries but about payment of allowances as a result of the last general elections. I do not think that non-payment of salaries could lead to such a thing which the hon. Member is not quite right to state has actually happened.\nMr. Kamuyu: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House how much will be paid to each constable and each inspector?\nMr. Sunkuli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, that question was not anticipated when we received the original Question. In fact, it is a totally different question altogether.\nMr. Kamuyu: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker ,Sir. This question is quite relevant. So may I request, through the Chair, that the Assistant Minister be asked to answer the question because the people in Narobi and the nation as a whole would like to know the position regarding this question?\nMr. Sunkuli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if it is the wish of the House that I do the mathematics involved here for the hon. Member, I will do so. However, I said that Shs. 48 million would go to 11,822 security officers. The hon. Member should do the mathematics and divide this money among that number of officers.\nMr. Anyona: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when we speak about the police, an impression is created that we are against them. We would like to demonstrate, using this Question, that, in fact, we defend everybody\'s rights. This problem is not just in Nairobi. As far as I am concerned, it affects many other parts of the country where the police and many other officers have not been paid their allowances. Would the Assistant Minister tell this House whether the problem is with the Electoral Commission or with the district commissioners who may have been given the money, but did not pay the police and the other officers involved?\nMr. Sunkuli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we have now sorted out the problem by getting in touch with the Accounting Officer who, as the hon. Member is now aware, is the Clerk of the National Assembly. It was this consultation that caused all this delay. However, we have gone through the problem and I am glad that, for a change, the Opposition is thinking about the welfare of our policemen.\nMr. Mathenge: Mr. Speaker, Sir, if the Assistant Minister tells us that the Government is going to commit Sh. 48 million to the police, does he mean to tell us that all the other civil servants who took part in the elections have been paid their allowances or are we going to have to ask another Question here relating to unpaid civil servants?\nMr. Sunkuli: Mr. Speaker, Sir, as far as my office is aware, we have paid all the other civil servants.\nSCHOOL ACTIVITY FEES \nMr. Mutani asked the Minister for Education:-\n(a) whether he could inform the House whether primary school activity fees are uniform throughout the country; and\n(b) how much is charged in Nithi Constituency per parent.\nThe Assistant Minister for Education (Mr. Komora): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\n(a) Permanent school activity fees are not uniform throughout the country.\n(b) The activity fees charged in Tharaka-Nithi District is Sh. 75/= per pupil in Standards VI to VIII as per the District Education Board Minute No. 5/9/93 of 14th May, 1993. The money is collected to meet the cost of running drama festivals, music festivals, athletics, ball games and gymnastics.\nMr. Mutani: Mr. Speaker, Sir, it was brought to my attention that some school heads had overcharged parents by asking them to pay between Sh. 75/= and Sh. 100/= per child. In some of these primary schools, a parent may have more than five children in the same school. Will the Assistant Minister order these school heads to refund money to parents who have been overcharged?\nMr. Komora: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this charge is not per parent; but per pupil.\nDr. Otieno-Kopiyo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, could the Assistant Minister tell the House what the criterion used is in arriving at this figure of Sh. 75/= per pupil, particularly since he says that this charge is not uniform throughout the country?\nMr. Komora: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the matter is normally decided by the local district education board and each board has its own criterion.\nDEFECTS IN PUBLIC PHONES \nMr. Anyona asked the Minister for Transport and Communications:-\n(a) whether he is aware that most public telephones are defective and that, as a result of these defects, members of the public lose money while making telephone calls; and\n(b) what he will do to rectify the situation.\nThe Assistant Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr. Morogo): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\n(a) It is not true that most public telephones are defective. The telephone, like any other equipment, may break down from time to time. Whenever there is a breakdown, the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC) has units and mechanisms to repair telephones.\n(b) The KPTC has instituted yellow telephone booths in various towns in this country from which the public can report to the management any telephone breakdown. There is also a special task force to attend to all maintenance matters related to public telephones.\nMr. Anyona: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have always thought that the correct premise to start from when approaching a problem is to accept the reality on the ground. If you start by denying the reality, I do not see how you can find a solution to the problem at hand. The Ministry has asserted that it is not true that most public telephones are defective. So, from there on, whatever else the Assistant Minister says is meaningless. It is public knowledge that public telephones throughout the country are defective for one  reason or another. I am not necessarily blaming the Ministry for this, but would the Assistant Minister, having said that most public telephones are not defective, carry out a survey in Nairobi and other places and tell us exactly how many public telephones are defective and how many are not?\nMr. Morogo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Question, as asked, states that most public telephones are defective, and what we are saying is that some are certainly defective. We are not denying that, but not most of them are defective. As I have already stated, any time there is a breakdown, we take measures to repair these telephones.\nAs to how many telephones are broken down in Nairobi, this is a question I did not anticipate. Maybe, we will look into that later.\nMr. Farah: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my own personal experience in Liboi, 200 kilometres from Garissa and situated in my constituency, is that the telephones do not work for half the month and every time technicians have to be brought from Garissa to repair these telephones. This costs a lot of money. In the light of that, could the Assistant Minister have technicians posted to the places where such incidents occur? It is in that particular place that there is a massive refugee population, and postal and telephone services would assist these people a lot if they were provided in the right way.\nMr. Morogo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I said that there is a task force looking into the issue of the broken down telephones whenever such cases arise. When we are satisfied that there is such a break down, we will dispatch part of the task force to the hon. Member\'s area.\nMr. Farah: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is it in order for the Assistant Minister to be telling us about a task force that would be brought from Garissa every time there is a telephone break down and which would consume thousands of shillings of taxpayers\' money when such break downs should cost only about KShs. 100/-? Why can we not have some technicians present in Liboi to repair telephones whenever there is a damage? We also know that the technicians claim a lot of allowances whenever this happens so that they can misuse public funds.\nMr. Morogo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I did mention that should this task force be satisfied that there is need for a technician to be stationed permanently at Liboi, we will do that.\nMr. Obure: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir, is it in order for the Assistant Minister to lie to this House and the public at large, or mislead this House, when it is well known that even the telephone booth in Parliament Buildings is broken down deliberately so that we can pay for the money that has been looted from the Kenya Posts and Telecommunications?\nS1BHN12K\nMOTION FOR ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE \nENOOSUPUKIA LAND CLASHES \nMinister for Labour and Manpower Development (Mr. Masinde): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I do move that the House do now adjourn.\nMr. Odinga: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, under Standing Order No.20, I beg to move that the House do now adjourn for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent national importance, namely, the land clashes in Enoosupukia Location, Narok District, Rift Valley Province.\nMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, this is a very serious matter which has come to the notice of this House. We have been informed that the County Council of Narok, gave notice to some people to move away from a place they call "a water catchment" area near the forest. We understand that some people calling themselves "the morans" and yet they were not morans, <OM/> are the ones who have been killing people in this area. The truth of the matter is that these are artificial morans who are recruited by certain people either from regular police or from General Service Unit to cause chaos in this area.\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Order! Hon. Members, let us give the subject that we are discussing the seriousness it deserves. I hope we will not come back to this level of noise again because it will be consuming time for nothing.\nThe Minister of State, Office of the President (Mr. Kones): On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker Sir.\nHon. Members: Sit down! Sit down!\nMr. Kones: I am on a point of order!\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Order, Mr. Odinga!\nThe Minister of State, Office of the President (Mr. Kones): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, hon. Jaramogi Oginga Odinga has made a very serious allegation to the effect that the Masaai who were in Enoosupukia were actually recruited from the Police and General Service Unit and were taken there in the name of morans. Could the hon. Member make a clear substantiation of this statement?\nMr. Odinga: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I know how I could interfere with people if I wanted. If you people do not want this House to be reasonable and put things right, we shall also do the same thing you are now doing if you do not want to keep quiet. I want everybody to live--- \nMr. Deputy Speaker: Address the Chair.\nMr. Odinga: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I will address the Chair. \nI want everybody to understand that we are very concerned about this issue. The other day, one of the Ministers from the land of the Maasai addressed a meeting and warned the people in Enoosupukia. Immediately after that, he received the so-called Maasai morans. However, these were not morans. Yesterday, the President said that some  cattle were slashed all over their bodies. However, can you compare cattle with people? If cattle go into your garden and you find them there, you can cut them up the way you want, but if some people treat their brothers like cattle, that is too bad.\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Order, hon. Members! I think hon. Odinga is reacting to the request that was made that he substantiates what he said. Therefore, you do not have to interrupt him.\nMr. Odinga: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am very happy with your  defence for me. You have done the right thing.\nI want to appeal to my brothers from the other side of the Chamber and the President---\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Odinga, did you get the point of order requiring you to substantiate the allegation you made?\nMr. Odinga: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, those hon. Members do not know points of order. Ask that hon. Member to tell you the number of the Standing Order he is referring to.\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Order, Mr. Odinga! Hon. Members, I kind of regret that I have to stand up in a Motion like that, when time is of the essence, and take one or two seconds. I am afraid, if you make an allegation, which is serious in the view of the Speaker and the Minister in charge of the police demands a substantiation, as has happened, you are under obligation to substantiate or withdraw the allegation. This is a very simple matter.\nMr. Odinga: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Minister I am talking about is hon. ole Ntimama.\nMr. Deputy Speaker: I am sorry about this, Mr. Odinga. I think the allegation you made was simple. You mentioned police officers, and that is what the Minister objected to.\nMr. Odinga: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, let me finish making the point I am making. When I have made my point, the Minister concerned will reply to the Motion.\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Order, hon. Members! A motion like this can serve the purpose it was intended to serve only if both sides will accept the spirit of give and take. Be prepared to hear each other whether you like each others\' views or not, and be prepared to live within the rules of the Standing Orders. It is a very simple matter, Mr. Oginga Odinga, and I regret that I have to take a few minutes making this clarification. Mr. Odinga, you made a wild allegation against the police that they are actually the morans, and the Minister in charge of the Police Force asked you to substantiate. I am afraid that is a simple matter, but you will have to substantiate.\nMr. Odinga: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I have photographs here.\nHon. Members: Hear! Hear!\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Order, hon. Members! Order! Mr. Odinga, are you laying those on the Table?\nHon. Members: Yes! Yes!\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Order! Order! The hon. Member has tabled a document in substantiation, and it is up to those--- There are procedures for verifying the validity of documentary substantiation and then we come back to it. For the moment we will continue.\nMr. Odinga: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir---\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Order! Order, hon. Members.\nMr. Kamuren: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Overruled! Overruled!\nMr. Odinga: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, these things are happening and we are pushing it on. The President of the country, who is in charge of the security of this country, should be able to stop all these clashes which are taking place all over the country. They must know that men are men everywhere. It is not that it is only one place which has men who can fight. Men are men everywhere and we are not going to play around with people who try to provoke others for no reason. The President of this country should stop his Ministers from playing about with violence. If the Ministers are playing about with violence, then how will it be with those of us who are free and who can do anything anywhere? We want peace. We talk about peace, and it can only come about if Ministers also observe peace. The whole country is now tired. They always say that it is the Opposition who provoke ugly situations. How about the violence today which is provoked by a Minister in daylight? We would like the President to take action and kick that Minister out of the Cabinet.\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, I would like to inform you that after consultations with the Chief Whips from both the Government side and from the three Opposition parties, we have agreed that the Mover be allowed 15 minutes, - which he has been allowed - the official Government responder be allowed 15 minutes as well and every other contributor, be allowed five minutes.\nThe Assistant Minister for Information and Broadcasting (Mr. Nassir): <&/>Kiswahili \nThe Assistant Minister for Information and Broadcasting (Mr. Nassir): <&/>Kiswahili \nHon. Members: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Order! Order! Hon. Members, it looks like, I am sorry to say, that some of us are not very serious about the seriousness of the subject before us. If we were serious we would at least hear each other. If you want to raise points of order on any statement that another hon. Member has made, you should appreciate that no statement from the opposite side is likely to be pleasant to you. It is really up to us to make this debate a success and in that way the time used will not have been taken up in vain.\nThe Assistant Minister for Information and Broadcasting (Mr. Nassir): <&/>Kiswahili \nMr. Kibaki: Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. We are dealing with a very serious matter.\nAn hon. Member: You are Gema!\nMr. Kibaki: It does not matter whether people with rotten heads want to shout "Gema" around! But the truth has to be faced because we shall all live in this nation and no one is going to evict another one by force and pretend that he has three souls and that he can live for ever like a stone;  none of us is of that nature because we are human beings. But what we are seeing is a programme of dealing with particular communities, which is organised, supervised and properly incited and executed; in fact, it is a long-term programme. It is, therefore, quite clear that---\nThe Minister of State, Office of the President (Mr. Kalweo): On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My point of order is very simple. Since hon. Kibaki has made the allegation that this is a programme which is properly organised, can he say who has organised it?\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Mr. Kalweo, that is a personal opinion! Will you continue, Mr. Kibaki?\nMr. Kibaki: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am speaking my own mind and nobody is going to silence us. So, let us be tolerant with each other. The fact of the matter is that we are demanding that those people who have been shot dead should not be buried before a proper post-mortem is done. We in, in particular, want a post-mortem done on a businessman called Mr. Wango because we would like know the person who shot him dead. We do not want these people to be buried an a hurry. We are being told that they were attacked by local morans but we know guns were used. Those who survived - unfortunately, the organisation was not good enough to enable the killing of everybody - say that guns were being used.\nMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, they were spoken to and they know what they were told. We are saying that proper post-mortems must be done before these people are buried in a hurry. Equally important is that there is no point in the Government denying that they knew what happened. Indeed, when the so-called 500 morans attacked innocent men and women when they were hiding at a church, the Chief, Assistant Chief, District Officer, District Commissioner and the Minister all knew those people were hiding there, and they knew they were going to attack that particular church. They did attack that church. That attack was known to the Government and was condoned by the same Government. In fact, they have celebrated over it. Equally important---\nThe Deputy Speaker: Order! Order! Order! Order hon. Ndicho! Order, hon. Dr. Kituyi! Hon. Members, it looks like some of the Members want the House to adjourn. If that is not the case, we only have one hour and I will appeal to Members of both sides to maintain order because the House is taking that hour to waste. Continuation of business will depend on the conduct of both sides of the House. Order! No Member has a right or any justifiable excuse to stand up without catching the Speaker\'s eye. Order! Order, hon. Nyanja! I still insist that some Members want the House to adjourn. If that is not the case, may we spend the rest of the time in a manner which is befitting the importance of this subject.\nS1BHN13K\nQUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE \nPAYMENT OF CONTRACTORS \n(Mr. Raila) to ask the Minister for Culture and Social Services:-\n(a) Could the Minister inform the House why M/s Ambajo Obudho, a General Engineering and Contractor, who was awarded a tender to construct car shade at Nyayo National Stadium has not been paid his dues since 1970?\n(b) What urgent steps is the Ministry taking to ensure that the payment is effected?\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Hon. Members, Mr. Raila\'s Question, which is listed down as the first Question by Private Notice, is not on today. For reasons which have been accepted by Mr. Speaker the Question has been deferred to tomorrow. So, we will go to Mr. Mbui\'s Question.\nFOOD SHORTAGE AT KERUGOYA HOSPITAL\nMr. Mbui: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Health the following Question by Private Notice.\n(a) Is the Minister aware that there is a shortage of food and medical supplies in Kerugoya District Hospital?\n(b) Will the Minister, as a matter of urgency, provide funds to procure food and medical supplies for this hospital?\nThe Assistant Minister for Health (Mr. Criticos): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\n(a) I am aware that occasionally there is a shortage of food and medical supplies to Kerugoya District Hospital. This financial year the hospital has been allocated KShs. 920,000/- for purchase of patient food and the first instalment of KShs. 568,000/- has already been issued to the hospital to run it up to December, 1993. The balance will be released to the hospital in December. The Health Management board should see how it can reschedule payments and even how to use some of the cost-sharing funds to pay for supplies when the hospital runs short of funds on certain occasions. As for the medical supplies the hospital has been receiving its share of medical supplies from the Medical Supplies Co-ordinating Unit on a regular basis whenever they are available. During this month of October the hospital received general drugs from this unit on the 9th, 15th and 22nd.\n(b) The necessary measures have already been instituted, as I have already explained.\nMr. Mbui: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am not sure that the Minister is really not aware although in the written answer he says that he is not aware. Is he really aware or not?\nMr. Criticos: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I must apologise to the hon. Member because when I received the reply this morning, I was not satisfied with it, so I went and did my own research on this particular Question in Kerugoya District Hospital. I have the revised answer which I asked the Ministry to deliver to the hon. Member this afternoon.\nMr. P.N. Ndwiga: On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I think the Minister is misleading this House. It is common knowledge in this country that virtually all Government hospitals have no food for patients. There is a specific case of Embu Hospital where the patients have to be fed by relatives. The patients have also got to use their own *pajamas> in the hospital. Why is the Minister misleading this House and the nation?\nMr. Criticos: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there is a lot of loud consultations in the House and I am unable to hear the hon. Member\'s point of order. Could he repeat it please?\nMr. P.N. Ndwiga: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I said that the Assistant Minister is deliberately misleading this House because it is common knowledge in this country that most Government hospitals in this country have no food, clothing nor drugs. I gave Embu District General Hospital as an example of a hospital where patients have to be clothed and fed by their relatives. There are neither drugs nor clothing in the Hospital for patients. Why is the Assistant Minister misleading this House?\nMr. Criticos: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the Ministry has never misled this House. A typical example is today when I was not happy with my answer so that I went to do my own research in Kerugoya General Hospital. We do have the problem of drugs as a nation, but the hon. Member cannot say that the Ministry of Health is misleading the House that there are no drugs at all in Kenya. We have a problem with the supply of drugs. We have not been receiving drugs and this will continue up to the first week of November.\nMr. Ndwiga: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, people are dying in the hospital because of lack of food and medicine. Can the Assistant Minister explain why?\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Next Question.\nLOSS OF UNCOLLECTED MILK\nMr. Mutahi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Co-operative Development the following Question by Private Notice:-\n(a) Is the Minister aware that Mukurweini Dairy Farmers are losing an average of Shs. 1,050,000/- per month in terms of uncollected milk in the evening?\n(b) In view of the serious economic problems facing these farmers, could the Minister urgently direct Kenya Co-operative Creameries to install a cooling plant at Mukurweini township?\nThe Minister for Co-operative Development (Mr. Munyi): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\nThe Kenya Co-operative Creameries (KCC) has a vigorous expansion programme to install cooling plants country-wide depending on milk production, availability of land and infrastructure.\nMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, Mukurweini Dairy Farmers should submit their request for installation of a cooling plant at Mukurweini Township and I am aware that my friend is the chairman of the Mukurweini Dairy Farmer Co-operative Society.\nMr. Mutahi: On a point of order Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. Would the Minister withdraw or substantiate that I am the chairman of Mukurweini Diary Farmers Co-operative Society because there is no such a thing?\nMr. Munyi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, he is aware that he is not the Chairman of Mukurweini Diary Farmers Co-operative Society, but the Chairman of another co-operative society in Mukurweini. He is aware!\nMr. Murungi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, could the Minister explain why K.C.C. is buying milk from farmers at Shs. 9/- per kilo while they are selling the same to consumer at Shs. 23/- per kilo when it is charged with the responsibility of giving a fair deal to milk farmers in country?\nMr. Munyi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member is aware that there is a law which says you should be paid Shs. 10/- per litre of milk; no less, no more.\nMr. Mutahi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, it is a Government policy for the people of this country to be self-sufficient both financially and in food. The Government encourages people to work hard. Mukurweini people have really worked hard to produce several litres of milk every evening, but this cannot be delivered to the K.C.C. Is it possible for the Ministry to give priority to Mukurweini Constituency and put up a cooling plant for the storage of evening milk produced by the dairy farmers.\nMr. Munyi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the hon. Member should be grateful that the Government did agree to establish a cooling plant in that area. If I were you, I would be grateful. You should appreciate.\nMr. Mutahi: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the cooling plant is not in my Constituency. It is in Murang\'a District. What I am saying is that we are losing at least Shs. 1 million per month. Can the Minister do something to build a cooling plant in Mukurweini Constituency?\nMr. Deputy Speaker: Next Order!\nMINISTERIAL STATEMENT\nSHOOTING OF VILLAGERS IN BUNGOMA\nThe Minister of State, Office of the President (Mr. Kalweo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, there was a report that appeared in some sections of the press today that armed Sabaot tribesmen attacked a family in Machaka Village in Bungoma District on 26th October, 1993.\nOn 26th October, 1993 at 10.00 a.m in Machaka Village, Sirisia sub-location in Bungoma District, an nunknown number of gansters armed with automatic weapons raided the home of Mr. Makwere. They shot him dead together with 10 members of his family, who included his wife, Hellen Cheboi and a few visitors. One man, Ngomuji Panpet was injured. The victims are all Sabaots who were in Mr. Makwere\'s house. They had gathered there for a marriage ceremony and while they were enjoying their food, they were attacked. As soon as the incident was reported, the members of the Provincial and District Security Committees rushed to the area in order to establish the motive of the attack and take appropriate measures. So far, the motive has not as yet been established. Intensive investigations are under way. Members of the public should know that the reports appearing in some sections of the local Press are grossly inaccurate, inconsistent and insensitive to details.\nMembers of one community have been incorrectly depicted as the aggressors while they are the victims of the wanton attack which has left helpless and innocent men, women and children dead. The attackers have not, so far, been identified.\nIt is very irresponsible for the Press to publish such incorrect information without confirming with the authorities on the ground. The reports may have been unwittingly meant to heighten tension between the two communities for unknown reasons by the Press representatives on the ground. The Government views these reports seriously and it demands corrective measures to be instituted immediately.\nThe Government further wishes to reassure the residents of the area that every effort will be made to apprehend the perpetrators of the crime. The Government has already taken measures aimed at ensuring that peace and security are maintained in the area. Nobody should take the law into his own hands as the Government is taking important action. The Press should also desist from publishing misleading information which would both confuse and complicate situation which is already being taken care of.\nMr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I urge that any person in the country or within that area who might be owning a gun or knows someone with a gun to come forward and report this matter because the Government is seriously taking the necessary steps on this matter.\nThank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.\nHon. Members: Point of order!\nThe Deputy Speaker: Mr. Munyasia!\nMr. Munyasia: Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I am grateful to the Minister for the report that he has made. I do not have any quarrel with the report I got this morning because, whether those killed were Sabaot or Bukusu, all are my constituents, and that is what concerns me.\nMr. Deputy Speaker, incidents of this kind are very common now in that area. I would like the Minister to tell us whether he sees any connection between the murder of a businessman in his grinding mill in Cheptais, last week, and this particular murder in this week.\nThe Minister of State, Office of the President (Mr. Kalweo): Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, the information which I have is that no businessman has been killed in that area. Anybody who was killed was within this area where a marriage ceremony was taking place.\nSo Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir, I would also inform the House, that, as I am talking here there is enough security trying to comb that area, not only for this incident alone but for many others because we know that the area borders a neighbouring country and the Government is sensitive and is looking into this issues very seriously.\nThe Assistant Minister for Tourism and Wildlife (Mr. Kisiero): Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir. I would like to thank the Minister for clarifying the report that appeared in the Press today. However, at the same time, although the Minister has not said who killed those innocent people, I am sure in the minds of the Sabaot, they know or, at least, they believe that their neighbours must have killed them. But let us leave that to the Provincial Administration to pursue and give us the information.\nHon. Members: On a point of order Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.\nS1BHN14K\nQUESTIONS BY PRIVATE NOTICE \nMONEY FOR TRANS NZOIA WARDS \nMr. Kirwa: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister of State, Office of the President the following Question by Private Notice.\n(a) How much money was collected from members of the public for the construction of Trans Nzoia Nyayo Wards?\n(b) Where is the money banked and who are the signatories of the bank account?\n(c) When will the money be utilised?\nThe Assistant Minister, Office of the President (Mr. Awori): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\n(a) A total of Kshs 677,601 was collected for the Trans Nzoia Nyayo Wards.\n(b) The money is banked at the Kenya Commercial Bank, Kitale Branch, and the signatories are the District Commissioner, Trans Nzoia, and the district accountant.\n(c) The funds will be utilised when sufficient funds have been raised to meet the Nyayo Wards construction cost.\nMr. Kirwa: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this is the background to this Question. In 1989, the district development committee was told that the money in question was Kshs 1.2 million. In 1990, we were told it was Kshs 932,000. In 1991, we were told it was Kshs 328,000 and in 1992, we were told there was no money. Today, we are told that it is Kshs 667,601. Can the Assistant Minister reconcile the situation and tell us exactly what the account number of the money in question is?\nMr. Awori: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am not sure of the other figures that were given, but the correct figure is as I have given, that is, Kshs 677,601, and it is in Kenya Commercial Bank Account, No. 101038669. The account is there, and it is quite open for the hon. Member to check and see what amount of money is there, and whether there have been any withdrawals. He will find that there have been no withdrawals whatsoever, and that the figure I have given is the amount of money that was collected during the <ea/>Harambee.\nMr. Kirwa: Mr. Speaker, Sir, can the Assistant Minister table a statement of this account since its inception? The correction that I would like to make is that there was never any <ea/>Harambee but the money was only collected from members of the public.\nMr. Awori: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am quite willing and ready to call for the bank statement and to table it.\nMr. Ndilinge: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the question also asks who the signatories were.\nMr. Speaker: Order! Order, hon. Members! He has not sat down!\nMr. Ndilinge: Mr. Speaker, Sir, according to the hon. Member who asked the Question, in 1989, the account was reading millions of shillings. Now, they are talking of Kshs 600,000. Where has the money gone, and who spent the it?\nMr. Awori: Mr. Speaker, Sir, with your indulgence, may I call for the bank statement from Kitale and table it? It will indicate whether there have been any withdrawals or not.\nHon. Members: There have been! There have been!\nMr. Speaker: Order! Order, hon. Members!\nMr. Awori: The statement will be tabled here as soon as possible.\nMr. Kapten: Mr. Speaker, Sir, we know that this money which was collected for Nyayo Wards was misappropriated by the local administration. Can the Assistant Minister tell us when he is going to table this bank statement, so that we may know when the money was banked in the account, how much was withdrawn, by whom it was withdrawn and the signatories. We also want to know the interest that has accrued on that money.\nMr. Awori: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have given an undertaking that when I leave the precincts of this building, I will call for the bank statement from 1989, and it will tell us the working of the account. I have already given the signatories as the district commissioner and the district accountant.\nMr. Speaker: Very well then. Next Question.\nCOLLAPSE OF MACHAKOS UNION BANK \nMr. Nthenge: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to ask the Minister for Co-operative Development the following Question by Private Notice.\n(a) What led to the collapse of the Machakos Union Farmers Savings Bank?\n(b) What action has so far been taken to ensure that the officials who embezzled the money are taken to court?\nThe Minister for Co-operative Development (Mr. Munyi): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to reply.\n(a) The Machakos Union Farmers Savings Bank closed its doors to customers in January, 1993, when it could no longer meet the depositors\' demand of withdrawal because the loanees were not paying their debts as expected.\n(b) Suspected embezzlement of money by the officials running the organization has been investigated and, in this regard, a team of audit officers has been detailed to carry out special audit covering the period going back to 1988.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, this exercise is continuing with the specific objective of identifying any form of embezzlement or mismanagement as far as the former management officials of the organisation are concerned. Once the exercise is completed, the necessary appropriate action will be taken against the identified culprits.\nMr. Nthenge: Mr. Speaker, Sir, when somebody borrows money, they normally invest it in saleable property. Can the Minister tell us why, if the loanees did not repay the loan, their property were not auctioned to recover the money?\nMr. Munyi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I would like to tell the hon. Member that the Machakos Co-operative Union does not only operate in Machakos, but also in Makueni. They also have other activities. On the issue that he has just mentioned, action has been taken against those who have been accused for having embezzled the money belonging to the farmers. So, action has been taken.\nCol. Kiluta: Mr. Speaker, Sir, while I appreciate the answer that has been given by the Minister, is he aware that this money was from the farmers and was intended to pay school fees for their children? What action does the Minister intend to take to ensure that, at least, these farmers are paid some substantial amounts to pay the school fees to enable their children to go back to school?\nMr. Munyi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, you can see that some of the members of our society are not really trusted. What the hon. Member has just said is exactly what the Government is doing to see that the farmers and the people in that area are uplifted. Action has been taken and I fully agree with the views of the hon. Member, and I would like to assure him that their views will be taken into consideration.\nMr. Gethenji: Mr. Speaker, Sir, the co-operative department is charged with a very important responsibility of looking after the interests of the farmers; these are the small-scale producers of coffee, tea and other crops. I am afraid that one of the problems that the farmers face is that co-operative officers have become involved in corrupt practices. They embezzle money in conjunction with senior officials of the co-operative societies. What is the Minister doing to ensure that co-operative officers are not involved in embezzlement of the money of small-scale farmers, since this practice is rampant in the country?\nMr. Munyi: Mr. Speaker, Sir, what hon. Gethenji is trying to ask is exactly what I have just answered.\nDr: Otieno-Kopiyo: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Is hon. Nyachae really in order to cross the Floor right in the middle of the Chamber instead of going to the Bar and crossing from there?\nMr. Speaker: Order! Order, hon. Members. I would like to hear Dr. Kopiyo\'s point of order. Dr. Kopiyo, why have you been changing sitting places and your voice as well? I would like to hear what the hon. Member is saying so that I can be able to give guidance to the House.\nOrder, Dr. Kopiyo! You must obey the law of gravity when I am on my feet.\nDr. Otieno-Kopiyo: Mr. Speaker, Sir, hon. Nyachae crossed the Floor right in the middle of the Chamber. I thought that one should to walk to the Bar and then ---\nMr. Speaker: Order! Order! The hon. Member is perfectly in order. A Member wishing to move from one side of the House to the other must proceed to the Bar bow and then cross the Floor there.\nMr. Speaker: Order! Order, hon. Ogur! I think we have come to the end of Question time. I have to give a chance to hon. Members who have sought my indulgence to raise points of order. These are hon. Robert Mungai, hon. Farah and hon. Shikuku. We will begin with hon. Farah.\nPOINTS OF ORDER\nMINISTERIAL STATEMENT: MEMBER SHOULD SEE MR. SPEAKER\nMr. Farah: Mr. Speaker, Sir, my point of order is under Standing Order No. 20 and it is on a question of national security. On the 3rd ---\nMr. Speaker: Order! Order, hon. Farah! You have not given me any notice as required by that Standing Order. I thought you were asking for an explanation.\nOrder, hon. Farah! The only time an hon. Member has a forum in the House is when he is within the Standing Orders of this House, and you know what Standing Order No. 20 says. If you have to raise any matter concerning Standing Order No. 20, you must give notification to the Speaker in writing, two hours before the House sits. You have not given me that notice in writing and I think it is important for hon. Members to be honest with themselves and with the Chair.\nMr. Farah: Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am seeking a Ministerial Statement.\nMr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Farah! I think you will have to consult the Chair again. Members must be honest with themselves, the Chair and the House. In other words, they must be very transparent.\nARREST OF MEMBER: PRESS REPORTS NOT AUTHORITATIVE\nMr. Ndicho: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. My point of order concerns what has been reported today in the Daily Nation. It reads:\n"The Nakuru MP, Bishop Kimani, was arrested by police yesterday because of publishing some information on 21 August..."\nMr. Speaker, Sir, you know very well that hon. Bishop Kimani asked this Question in this House on an incident where an aircraft had sprayed chemicals in this area to control quela birds. Is it in order for policemen to arrest Members of Parliament when they ask Questions in this House? If I know that I am going to ask a Question and the police from, for instance, Ruiru, Juja or Thika will be waiting for me along the road to arrest me because of that, then I will be forced to abstain from asking Questions.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, under Standing Order No. 45 (i), I want to ask whether under Standing Order No. 171 (4) we can move a Motion of Adjournment to discuss this particular incident.\nMr. Speaker: Order! Hon. Members know quite clearly the provisions of Section 4 of the Powers and Privileges Act which provides that no Member shall be liable, either criminally or civilly, for any matter that he has raised in the House. We also know, under our Standing Orders, that we do not take newspaper reports as conclusive on any matters that are reported therein. I think the House had better wait until the hon. Member himself is here, because he will be in a better position to give the exact facts to this House. I will not bend the law, and the law is clear on this.\nAlso, newspaper reports are not authoritative and, therefore, they cannot be made the subject of debate in the House.\nThe Assistant Minister for Labour and Manpower Development (Mr. Komen): Send him out!\nMr. Speaker: Order! Hon. Komen, I have said several times here that the Chair is competent to make rulings on behalf of the House. I have already made that ruling, and I think the best course is for the Members to respect it and proceed. I do not want it to be revisited ---\nS1BHN15K\nMOTION \nTHAT, MR. SPEAKER DO NOW LEAVE THE CHAIR \nThe Minister for Health (Mr. Angatia): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I beg to move that Mr. Speaker do now leave the Chair.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I want to make Members of Parliament realise that the Ministry of Health is a service Ministry whose aim is to improve the health of the people so that they enjoy good health and become economically active all the year round by putting more emphasis on prevention of diseases and treatment of those diseases which cannot be prevented.\nMr. Ogur: On apoint of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. We are discussing a very important vote and for this reason, I would request that the Minister speaks loudly and very clearly for us to hear. We must hear him clearly!\nMr. Speaker: Yes, Mr. Ogur is quite right here. I have dealt with this issue before and I have told hon. Members to try as much as possible to make themselves audible. However, it may also help the House much more if hon. Members themselves would consult each other in low tones so as to allow those of us who do not have extra loud voices to be heard. As I have said in the past, I have no way in which I can regulate the volume of any hon Member on the Floor.\nThe Minister for Health (Mr. Angatia): Thank you very much, Mr. Speaker, Sir for your ruling. If Members listened, I am sure they will hear me. I was saying that I would like all Members to appreciate that investment in health is investment in the general welfare of this country and in development in general.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, the main goals of this Ministry are about six and, I want to read them as they are outlined in the current Five-Year Development Plan. The first responsibility of this Ministry is the coverage of all cases and making sure that all people have access to hospitals.\nThe second aim is that we should put a lot of emphasis on maternal and child health and family planning services. The third aim is the consolidation of urban-rural curative and preventive medicine or services for the whole country. Fourthly, it is my intention to strengthen the Ministry\'s capacity at the district level. Here, we have set up district health management boards and I would like to ask Members of Parliament to take more interest in these institutions.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, the fifth goal of the Ministry of Health is that it wants to increase its inter-sectoral co-ordination by asking other Ministries and sectors to join it in dealing with various problems such as AIDS, environmental health and other matters. And finally, according to our development plan, we want to increase alternative health financing sources. Here, we are talking about cost-sharing and I am sure that Members of Parliament are already aware of this.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, since Independence, we have been making a lot of progress and we have made some very tremendous achievements. For example, in 1963, we had only 66 hospitals, but today ---\nMr. Ogur: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. I respect hon. Boy, but on very many occasions, he turns his back on both sides of the House, the Kanu side and the Opposition side, and I do not know what it means. Hon. Boy should be told not to be doing that any more, particularly when an important Motion by the Minister for Health is on the Floor. Please, Mr. Speaker, can you ask hon. Boy to move from here and go to talk elsewhere?\nMr. Speaker: Order! I do appreciate the sentiments of the hon. Member for Nyatike. The Motion of the Ministry of Health and the health of our nation are both very important. Health is a very important aspect of our lives.\nYesterday I pointed out to hon. Members that if you are sitting in your place in accordance with the Standing Orders, then you must not be on motion from position A to position B, unless you are contributing. Otherwise, it is contrary to Standing Orders. So, I will ask the hon. Members of the House to sit in accordance with the provisions of the Standing Orders and that means "sitting on the Bench".\nDr. Otieno-Kopiyo: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir.\nMr. Speaker: I think I have made a ruling on that. Is your point of order on what the Minister for Health has said?\nDr. Otieno-Kopiyo: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. Some of us who were not in this House last time and those who were here remember hon. Angatia as one of the "loudest" Back-benchers at that time. Somehow, since he became a Cabinet Minister, he does not speak loud enough for us to hear. I cannot "hear" what he is saying. Has something happened to him since he became a Cabinet Minister?\nMr. Speaker: Order, hon. Members! You know very well that I am not a doctor, don\'t you? Can you hon. Minister take a position that is near a microphone or move to the front? As I have said, health situations are very important and as you can hear from the House itself, hon. Members wish to hear what you are saying. Please, try as much as you can to increase your volume.\nThe Minister for Health (Mr. Angatia): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure that these hon. Members can hear me. It is true that I was one of the most "vocal" hon. Members of Parliament some years back, but now that what I was fighting for has been achieved, which is a good Government, I do not have to "shout" any more.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, I was telling hon. Members that we are operating according to our National Development Plan, and I have read out six main policies. I have always told hon. Members that in 1978 the World Health Organization made a declaration called Alma Ata which put emphasis on health-for-all by the year 2000. This means improving health care to all people. The main aim here is to put health into two parts. The first and most important part is the prevention and promotive care. The second part, which is for treatment, will receive less emphasis than the first one. I want to assure hon. Members that since Independence, we have been making a lot of progress. I had informed hon. Members about the tremendous progress that has been made, and I would like to summarize it for all the hon. Members to hear.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, the first one, is that while in 1963 we had 52 hospitals, now we have 93 district hospitals, 8 provincial hospitals, one functioning referral hospital and another referral hospital being built at Eldoret. In 1963 we had 160 health centres, now we have 391 health centres and we had 250 dispensaries, but now we have 1,134 dispensaries. In the meantime, because of our emphasis on prevention of diseases, we have had child mortality rate reduced by almost 50 per cent as of now. Our life expectancy has increased from 55 years to over 60 years. These are achievements which our Government has made, and I would like to ask hon. Members to take stock of this and to be proud of these achievements.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, the details of what I am saying and what we have been able to do so far are embodied in the effort of teaching the rural community to remove the burden of diseases such as malaria, intestinal worms, tuberculosis, measles and others. We can do this by use of preventive measures rather than to wait until people go to hospitals.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, the second issue here is that we have decentralized medical services. The Ministry of Health and <ea/>wananchi through the spirit of <ea/>Harambee have been able to achieve what I have just mentioned. We are prepared to provide maternal health and family planning services. Here again, we are relying on the communities to do just that. Promotion of our own health is the responsibility of all of us. As I have said many times before, I would like hon. Members to realise that this year we launched a document called World Development Report which is investing in health. There are various programmes which come under this ---\nMr. Kiliku: On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, Sir. The hon. Minister should realise that it is out of order to read a speech. He should convince this House why the Ministry of Health should get this money and also tell us how his Ministry will use this money rather than telling us what his Ministry has achieved since Independence. We want to know what we will achieve with the money that will be allocated to the Ministry.\nMr. Speaker: Order, Mr. Kiliku! The Minister is giving a pre-view. Proceed hon. Angatia.\nThe Minister for Health (Mr. Angatia): Mr. Speaker, Sir, I must say that I am impressed with the interest that the hon. Members are showing in this Vote. I hope that they will give me all the money that I am asking for.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, we have designed various programmes which are helping us achieve these targets that I have set out. One of this is called Kenya Expanded Programme of Immunisation (KEPI). This is mainly funded by donors. As of now, Kenya has achieved 75 percent immunisation of its people. I would like to appeal to our people that we use the funds that are allocated to the Ministry to make sure that we increase immunisations coverage from 75 per cent to 90 per cent. When we finally achieve 100 per cent, we shall have the time to concentrate on other diseases.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, having listed some of these diseases, I would like to say that these programmes are funded mostly by external sources. These include maternal child health and family planning activities, the KEPI activities that I have referred to and upper respiratory infection diseases which afflict our children and also adults. We are very grateful to the international donors who have helped us to maintain these programmes and it is my sincere hope that they will continue doing so.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, on curative activities, I would like to say that we have done very well by building so many hospitals. However, I would like to ask our people to reduce their tendency to over-rely on medicine. When Government gives us enough money we shall do our best to make sure that patients will be treated. At this point, I would like to tell hon. Members that in the process of expansion, we have put up some health institutions which so far are not functioning and I am sure many hon. Members here are aware of the institutions which have been put up, but are not functioning due to lack of staff, drugs or equipment. This means that the money that was received by the Ministry of Health was not enough.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, just to remind the hon. Members, some of the hospitals we have and we have not put into full use include:- Longisa District Hospital, Vihiga District Hospital, Mokowe District Hospital, and Webuye District Hospital. The new dispensaries with all the facilities, including facilities for family planning and population control, are Injinia in Nyadarua District, Cheptalal in Kericho, Gesusu in Kisii, Ochowa in Elegeyo Marakwet, Kimalel in Baringo, Inokopil in Kajiado, Ruiru in Kiambu, Sacho Health Centre in Baringo, Keumbu in Kisii, Kithigei, Isenya, Malakisi, and Manyala health centres.\nMr. Speaker, Sir, today we have nearly 39,000 people who are infected with AIDS and over 800,000 who have been found to be HIV positive, but who have not yet become clinical cases. If all the 800,000 fell ill today, they would occupy all the bed spaces in the country and we would not have any more bed spaces left.', 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '3473853b-11d1-4f1d-9069-35589d5052fa', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:00.963532+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9727572202682495, 'non_english_score': 0.02724277973175049}
{'text': "<$A> how would you like one to look at the linguistic competence Putting aside uh the theory by Noam Chomsky and Dell Hymes' idea of uh communicative competence according to you what's the idea of competence Yes\n<$B> I think competence the way I understand competence like the way a kid a child can be able to use the language to understand the language and like apply the language to usage as he's been taught earlier\n<$A> So in other words it's more of uh the application part of the language \n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> So you differ with uh basically you differ with Chomsky's idea that uh linguistic competence is basically that set of rules that is in the child you know uh let alone applying it Right Now I want to look at this I want to have uh this discussion in advanced levels Of course we're dealing with a cognitive level uh if possible at a phonological level that's about the sounds uh orthographic level lexical level roughly and so on Now cognativism basically has to do with the mind as we all know And cognativists are interested in explaining the underlying motivation of a language and speech Okay And of course talking about cognativism we are reminded of Jean Piaget the famous psychologist Now Jean Piaget argues that a child's language development uh basically depends on three main factors The first factor he says is interaction with his environment The second factor he says it is his perceptual and cognitive capacity And the third factor he says it is his linguistic experiences okay Now interaction with the environment uh We want to see how this are applied can be applied to uh what is this called children's literature or the literary text made for the child so that it can help him to get that competence in the language Now if you talk about interaction with his environment as Jean Piaget says like take for example this story of uh the elephant and other animals it is found in a book The Source Stories I've forgotten the author The Source Stories Now in this kind of this in this kind ofRRR story we have uh we got so many animals okay and then uh the elephant the hare the lion and so on and so forth And then they say that uh all of a sudden it became very dry There was drought all over It was so dry he says he says uh even the palm tree could not produce liquor I believe this should have been somewhere in the coast Now what I'm saying is uh this kind of story explains so many things about the environment It explains uh the purpose of trees the purpose of animals the animals are all named there and that there can be drought in an environment In other words what I'm saying is this kind of story exposes the child to the environment so in a way that child is able to interact with the environment through this story Okay And since uh as Jean Piaget says that uh the a child's interaction with the environment is a basic factor in knowing in a child's developing uh linguistic competence Then I should think uh the literary text indeed helps a child to develop competence in a child unless you want to object Mary anything to say\n<$C> With the interaction with the environment uh a child not only have the written texts but you have the spoken texts for example we have the child's play and the games that usually have within the environments and some of these songs and games can have could be that repetitive part and they can even have some words that the child at the end of the day will question what they are and it is in his <O/> trying to know what these words are the child will come to improve his competence So the child's competence or the child's linguistic competence can improve through the written as well as the spoken text That's my view\n<$D> Okay another addition or rather a question As far as this kind of environment is concerned can we can we say that uh this environment must be the that that particular environments in which the child finds himself of herself or is this just in any other environment For example uh applying uh I'm referring to a situation whereby maybe an African child okay he's exposed to that kind of environment in which he finds himself Or at another level we find that this text is extracted for uh for maybe a European environment So at that level which kind of environment have you referred to\n<$A> Well I would think uh any type of environment whether immediate environment or other environment Did you think even if you talk if you wanted to talk about if a text is talking about things that are not actually present in the immediate environment of the child it's talking about snow it's talking about uh well maybe some kind of plants that are not present in the immediate environment But you see the child still is coming to learn about these things you see He knows that at least they are present Maybe in future he want to talk about them So if he's been exposed to these kind of things this kind of vocabulary at the beginning then it will be easy for him to express himself I mean that's basically what we're interested in the competence of the child \n<$D> Then I think that in the same the sameRRR on the same token I could just ask maybe it is better as far as this cognitive level is concerned Imagine the book talks about a problem okay learning from known to the unknown Then I think as far as the environment is concerned it is better to impose or to expose the child to his okay to the stories which come from his immediate environment and then as as he continues to learn then you can bring stories from a far off environment \n<$A> Yeah I think that is true Okay now we also talked about okay Jeam Piaget also talks about his uh the child's perception and cognitive capacity and his linguistic experiences Now here this is where your point comes in Mr <name/> Uh that uh sometimes uh the child through the text is also exposed to things that don't appear in his immediate environment For example if we talk about the famous poem in called the London Bridge It's found on page sixty-eight in this book You know this kind of thing Now the child may not even have seen uh the gold the silver or this kind of this kind of things that are mentioned in the text okay Because maybe they are not in his immediate environment But we can also note the fact that the child in future might want to use that kind of vocabulary to express one thing or another okay For example he might not have seen gold around but at least he might have seen a golden watch okay So if he wants to say that this watch is made of gold unless he's exposed he the child will have been exposed at the beginning from this kind of thing it will be difficult for him to express himself Okay so Jean Piaget also says that uh children learn language by associating it with context Children learn a language associating with context They also learn a language by associating it with meaning Now as far as this context is concerned I wanted to I was thinking for example in the animal story I told you about the context within that story basically is uh the animal world okay So within that context we have some kind of things uh that uh are expected in such a context for example the name those names of animals the hare the animal and so on and so forth okay So the way in which the literary text this kind of literary text will expose the child to the world improve the competence of the child is that uh when it comes to such a context the child is aware that he's already aware of the kind of vocabulary that is expected the kind of words that are expected in such a situation and therefore he is able to express himself like that When we come to uh uh since Jean Piaget also says that a child learns a language by associating it with meaning Now for example in this story of the elephant and other animals we're told okay in the long run the animal decided to dig a well so that uh they can have access to water Now all the animals participated in that exercise but the hare as clever as he was did not want to participate in this kind of exercise He said he can survive he can still survive with or without water okay And therefore when eventually they had dug the well and the water was now flowing the hare wanted to use that water so uh the uh animals decided that they would come they would keep vigil in turn they would guard the well in turns so that the hare could not hare could notRRR uh get access to that water Now what I want to refer it to is the term keep vigil okay keep vigil So the child may not be even aware of uh the meaning of such a term in the first place okay but he can associate it with the meaning The meaning in this context is that uh uh the idea was to prevent the hare from getting the water okay So uh even though the child might not know the meaning of this word he can still understand that the III m uh the main aim is to keep watch for the child I mean for the hare not to get the water to drink this water Now there is this poem which uh this poem called The Little Fish of The Little Fish That Will Not Do As It Was Bid I'll just read it briefly This poem goes like this Now this poem basically is about a little fish and his mother in the sea and it wanted to uh and it wanted to go and okay but it wanted to go and eat uh a fly But you know it was it is that hook when the fishermen go to the sea they use the flies sometimes they use the flies to as a bait yeah So actually that fly was a bait and the little mother and the little fish was asking permission from his mother to go and eat that and eat that fly But its mother told her that that is not just a fly but it is a bait you know But this little fish could not did not want did not take heed of this advice and so it went ahead to eat that fly and then it was stuck and it's so it died Now what I'm interested in this poem is uh the way in which uh as a text it involves uh a beginning and an ending okay kind of a cause and an effect It involves rather a sequence of events that uh actually culminated into the death of a little fish And when it when we relate this to the child's experience it's like a kind of experience it gives to the child is that uh the child through such a kind of a text it learns to it learns to put things sequentially it learns to put things in a sequence that uh things that don't I mean just don't come from nowhere and you know there has to be a kind of a beginning a middle and an end that kind of thing Okay I will do the phonological level if you don't have any questions \n<$C> Let me ask something\n<$A> Please\n<$C> We have some stories with a complicated plot whereby we don't have a flow of ideas from one step to another one <O/> we find that there is that mix up of events How do you react to that now that you have said that the ordering of events like that straight forward plot within that poem will enable the child to put things you know\n<$A> sequentially", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> ... official languages I think that's what you can find in literature on <O/> policy uh that's why I referred you to Leitham yeah anyway go on \n<$B> Now we briefly look at uh Kiswahili in Tanzania and then we will compare uh the Swahili in uh Tanzania and Kenya Now we know the history of Kiswahili and how it began maybe uh as a lingua franca between the Arab traders and the African traders along the coast and then uh it's diffused in the interior I think that one we are aware of it So Kiswahili use has started uh becoming uh elitist in colonial Tanganyika that's what I said in my paper The German administrators encouraged the African chiefs who were known as <ea/>akidas to use it as a language that will unify the people in the administration of their policies This was also adopted after Tanzania or Tanganyika became a British colony after the First World War Now during Tanganyika's struggle for independence Kiswahili was adopted as a language of the leading African political party known as TANU Tanganyika African National Union This party was in itself led by elitist Africans among them was Mwalimu Julius Nyerere who are who had uh gone through uh the British I think education system so he was an elitist But when he was picking on the language for his party he decided to pick on uh Kiswahili which was more uh understood by the masses than English or any other foreign language Now at independence of Tanganyika in nineteen sixty-one Kiswahili was designated Tanganyika's national language and in nineteen sixty-seven a bill of parliament made Kiswahili the official language of Tanzanian Union So it had now become a union After independence there was the coming in of Zanzibar So the Tanzanian Union in nineteen sixty-seven comprised of Tanganyika and Zanzibar and its language official language became Kiswahili Now Nyerere himself the first president popularised Kiswahili so much as a language of government and administration He decided to make all his public speeches at least within Tanzania in the Kiswahili language And he encouraged all the government officials to use Kiswahili as the language of government activities So as we're going to see is that uh Nyerere's uh political credentials his political charisma had uh very much been promoted by the use of Kiswahili language I think uh we were able even us we were able to hear Nyerere on the radio every day addressing the nation in Kiswahili language after the news from Tanzania which was something very popular So Nyerere himself also as an elite decided that books that were used in Tanzanian education system should be translated into the Kiswahili language I think he even uh translated some Shakespearean works into the Kiswahili language uh an example I think is uh The Merchant of Venice and uh Julius Caesar So he was leading that the books that should be used in the Tanzanian system be it foreign books or books written within the Tanzanian state should all be in Kiswahili language Uh in his uh political philosophy of uh socialism Nyerere also directed that the language to be used in the communes that language that should be used in uh the villages known as <ea/>vijiji was to be Kiswahili language So when Kiswahili is now used in the villages it's acted more as a maybe a unifying language It was going to be uh at the disposal of all the people because the village in Tanzania at that time was actually the base it was acting as the base of the Tanzanian economy So from nineteen sixty seven also the Tanzanian parliament became uni-lingual after that uh declaration after the I think Arusha Declaration the Tanzanian parliament became uni-lingual It started using the Kiswahili language as the language of parliament The parliamentary debates in Tanzania are in Kiswahili language and most of them are aired on uh over Radio Tanzania unlike the case maybe in Kenya where we hardly hear of uh the parliamentary speeches or debates or contributions He also set up translation committees in specialised areas Of course English continued to be used in courts of law in Tanzania until recently but uh with time now there is this gradual use of the Kiswahili language in courts of law in Tanzania And uh right now what is remaining in Tanzania is that English is used formally at the university So at the primary school level at the secondary school level there is more of uh Kiswahili being used in uh Tanzania So I want us to maybe look at this as uh a political move Is it a political move Is it elitist as we saw uh maybe from the title of this paper Maybe I could ask my colleagues to respond to that Do you see any elitism in the choice of this uh uh language of Kiswahili in Tanzania What are the political implications here \n<$C> <O/> but I could maybe say that uh actually the way we know Tanzania it has so many languages and that uh the the theRRR choice of Kiswahili I may not know the reasons why Kiswahili was picked but when we consider the people who actually picked on Kiswahili that initially uh it was the language of uh a political party a leading political party at that time and therefore that actually brings in the political affiliation and that uh Mwalimu Julius Nyerere actually was an elite and that he picked on Kiswahili uh of course with the reasons that it is going to unite the Tanzanians uh I think up to that there is that political aspect of it and when we consider the people actually who were popularising Kiswahili uh I tend to think it is it has that uh elitists' overtone in it I actually I' do not maybe believe that Kiswahili was accepted uh by the people of Tanzania I've talks earlier that uh Tanzania was composed of so many languages uh I do not believe that most of them actually came at a consensus to agree that now they needed uh a language to unite them So the fact that it was picked and popularised by a certain group of people I think it brings in the idea of imposition the idea of uh politics and policing in it\n<$D> I think uh I agree with you to a large extent on the idea that the initial the initial idea of uh imposing Kiswahili was the to be able to communicate and the elitists' attitude came in initially But uh gradually as you see the development what happens then that once this Kiswahili becomes the only form that used to be used even uh the level where it's now being used in primary and secondary school as uh official language I think we are breaking away from uh from the elitist attitude and spreading the language to the masses In other words now it ceases to become an elitist uh tool of controlling or rather ruling uh the minor uh over that the majority And uh we now look at it in terms of giving information knowledge and power so to say to the entire nation that is the majority So uh it might have started as an elitist attitude but uh if you look at the policies that Nyerere was trying to propagate the ultimate goal is that he was trying to break down from this elitist attitude and uh and enable or rather give the power to the people That is where actually this aspect of socialism comes in The socialist attitude was there where there was almost an equal sharing of power and of course uh property within society So in order for him to achieve that form he has to break this elitist attitude of what was in the case in Kenya where we had that democratic so to say society where we have people uh grouped according to classes but the socialist breaks this down and uh therefore the way he had to do it was to use this language official language planning uh policy which uh enabled even the majority to be able to be uh communicating and also own property uh within uh the nation as such I don't know but that's the way I'm looking at it I'm looking at it from elitist to uh say elevating everybody to the same level \n<$B> I think uh the choice of uh Kiswahili language in Tanzania goes back to the colonial times as I said earlier and uh it's had a firm base even before being chosen as the language of Tanzania It was wide-spread in this country however the role of the powers that be cannot be downplayed Fasold traces the languages' colonial legacy the languages' colonial history and I quote End of quote So I think uh we have seen the reason why it was chosen It's had a long history It had uh a base It had already established itself among many people even before it was being chosen I don't know if there is any question again up to there\n<$C> I don't know whether the argument was what I was trying to reason that what if you look at Nyerere apart from the long history as you were saying Nyerere is actually trying to propagate the aspect of socialism the socialist belief and uh in so doing he is giving knowledge or rather he has to get the whole people behind him rally the whole nation behind him So does this bringing in the elitist uh concept in \n<$B> I think it is uh the light in which we view Nyerere as a person Because however much convincing he could have tried to be maybe he wanted to be a socialist in uniting his people in uh setting up a social maybe a socialist society in Africa or a socialist country But uh all in all Nyerere remains an elite He is uh even a doctor So when we just look at his credentials only uh they make him an elite So whichever thing he's going to do we're going to look at him as an elite We're going to look at him as a politician \n<$A> He's an elite that is granted nobody is uh disputing that The question that he is asking is was Kiswahili an elitist language itself Nyerere and the English is just as efficient in using English as he is in using Kiswahili If it was the elitist uh uh motivation that he had he would have opted for English Why did he opt for Kiswahili Compare that with Kenya KANU KADU in the fifties during the fight for independence used Kiswahili too didn't they But why did we opt for English as the official language at independence Why So compare Tanzania compare Tanzania and Kenya and then see why Why Kiswahili in Tanzania and English in Kenya That's the big question And that's why that is uh uh uh forever referring it to the socialist orientation of Tanzania as opposed to the capitalist orientation of Kenya And that's why you were also talking about Fasold's reference to Kiswahili having had a base in in Tanzania So that the choice of Kiswahili as a national language in Tanzania was almost uh a foregone conclusion And the fact that Nyerere was using it an <_/>an a elite himself gave Kiswahili prestige so that it moved if we use this we useRRR this one here Even if it was this a language for unifying Tanzanians Nyerere being an elite himself the head of state and then making the language the language of parliament the language of the courts the language of higher education then moved the Kiswahili from here to this quadrant The fact that the learned uh elitist Tanzanians are using Kiswahili gave Kiswahili prestige A language can also be promoted by giving it functions functions that give it prestige So it moves from here It's a language of prestige because we have <O_><O/> You see we have what is

{'text': '<$A> Uh in the case of Prospero who deliberately conjures a tempest to bring his foes from <name/> to the island to the effect of revenge and the revenge is in quotes which he would call justice regardless of the sufferings the victims are undergoing So in the same way uh <name/> revisits the historical trans-shipment of slaves uh to Europe the suffering and the ordeal of inhumanity uh inhuman treatment they went through and the lack of guilt-conscience of the ship captains or masters to the extent that one of the of the ship captains composes a religious song and I quote "How sweet the name of Jesus sounds" We realise that when there is this uh transportation of these people disposed from Milan there is this The captains are actually so They are not guilt-conscious They are not aware of what they are doing Such that there is a captain who actually goes ahead in composing as song "How sweet the name of Jesus sounds" and to I mean to enrich the British religion So uh to them they were in a mission to civilise the world at whatever costs Therefore <name/> uses religion and colonialism uh and that is what the world the post-colonial man would review or would view as the religious hypocrisy Okay As a continuation of that point uh despite the torture that is a characteristic of the slave master relationship <name/> exposes dependency of the master on the slave so that Prospero dares not uh cannot overstep his bounds in dealing with Caliban because murdering Caliban would be an act of pure suicide We realise that in uh our text there is a <O/> that uh the there is a stretch uh a place where he says that uh uh killing uh no sorry he says that nor Caliban nor Prospero nor <name/> and so therefore everything is not existing So we realise that uh Prospero himself is realising that he\'cannot actually exist without the existence of the slave So the slave is part and parcel of him for him to exist And the politics of the island are presented as parallel to the state which is absolutely run by one man that is Prospero Therefore Prospero has no need of bureaucrats because Caliban is his friend which means among other things his physical survival He and I quote what Prospero says "But it\'s we can\'t miss him He does make our fire thatch in our fire uh our roof and serve in offices That <O_><O/> oh slave Caliban thou art thou speak That\'s what he says So you realise that he\'s actually realising the role that uh Caliban plays in their lives So without Caliban they can\'t exist there Then the suggestion that <name/> is making here is in a way which Prospero himself uh saw himself in relation to the immediate neighbourhood around him So in a nutshell we can say that <name/> draws attention to the uh to Prospero\'s fears of his subjects that is he cannot he is not confident of his position as a master He looks at his subjects as a as a challenge So that to deal with that feeling Prospero uses his subjects\' past as a weapon to subdue or demand their loyalty Uh and what I mean by this He uses their past You realise that uh when <name/> comes to stage uh Prospero is actually reminding him of where they <O/> got them from You know they were not a people they were just children of nature before he came So he actually constantly reminds them of their past Uh we can say that uh as a as a continuation that <name/> draws another parallel between survival of Caliban between the survival of Caliban and that of the savage that is the deformed and the deformed slaves As Caliban is in the tempest they worked and were rebellious that is the slaves I am referring now to the <O_><O/> You realise that this book is actually referring to is a prophetic word to the colonialism that was to come So I\'m saying that as Caliban in The Tempest the slaves were worked and were rebellious and often went wild in the spirits of freedom and were imprisoned and yet they carried on they survived as though they were they had some divinity which made them believe in their capacity to last The next points can uh be that <name/> also draws from the uh contrast of attitude between <name/> and Prospero It is this contrast of attitude towards a common disaster as <name/> puts it in which uh which introduces the noble and compassionate nature of <name/> on the one hand and the supernatural power of the father on the other So we can say that <name/> brings out a similarity between Caliban and <name/> that is Caliban uh <name/> and Caliban have a bond which is not easily broken They are alike in their ignorance and there are parallels in their response to strangers from the world beyond these shores For example uh <name/> is surprised by the fact that Ferdinand knows English language just like Stephano He\'s surprised when Caliban speaks English <name/> is also adds that Caliban and <name/> share ignorance which is also the source of submission Okay what I\'m trying to say is if you have read the text there is a point in which Miranda is actually surprised by the fact that uh that that man can speak English You know to Miranda these people who are actually they are they are not supposed to know this uh their language such that he\'s uh she\'s surprised when Ferdinand speaks English just as she can So uh in The Tempest you find that Prospero claims to have equipped Caliban\'s purposes with language so that without language they wouldn\'t have been known Uh that is the people who are in the island And for this service he demands gratitude from Caliban who disappoints him by using the very language  subversively uh to assert his rights and protest domination At this point <name/> sees Prospero\'s service of availing the aid of the world and the world here refers to language to Caliban as hypocritical gesture in that Prospero only aims at polishing Caliban\'s utility as his servant You realise that uh as Prospero equips Caliban with the language he he\'s equipping him for his own gains so that he may be able to serve him so well Such that to him it\'s like Caliban cannot acquire beyond what he has actually given him but you realise that Caliban acquires much more such that he uses the same language to claim for his rights and possession of the land of the island Therefore uh you can say <quote/> " That\'s a quotation Uh By this uh <name/> reflects the fears inherent in Prospero of seeing Caliban as a challenge and as a possibility and in this he was drawing an analogy <O/> between Adam and God And he was trying to to bring up uh the fact that by God uh uh creating an awareness to Adam that there is a tree of life and there\'s something he actually made a risk such as the it\'s the risk that Prospero is making in giving Caliban a language such that now the uh the language that he\'s uh given is he used it he uses it to get what he was not supposed to get Therefore <name/> continues to reflect on the centre\'s mind that is Prospero\'s view of Caliban as a child of nature who lacks the concept of difference Prospero sees Caliban not capable of recognising the difference between quality uh the quality of Prospero and <name/> between Prospero and Stephano Therefore Caliban is not allowed to distinguish for the eye that is that is that register personality and he must derive consciousness which could be regarded as a person <O/>\n<$B> <O_><O/>\n<$C> Thanks a lot Well I believe you have mentioned some of the most crucial issues uh which uh I think the rest can <O_><O/> in terms of uh starting a discussion on some of the issues that she has touched on But of course I don\'t know what you meant by <O/> Yeah when she she\'s talking of uh I think some of the <O/> are there But when we When she talked of these weaknesses of Shakespeare which she imagines are the kind of things uh <name/> is trying to exploit and then I was wondering whether really you know the word weakness would be uh suitable I think uh mainly what we are thinking about here is the whole condition of authority You know the condition of authority as constituted uh is what really <name/> is trying to look at especially the possibilities of subverting that authority Of course authority as represented here by Prospero uh which she mentioned cause I was saying like uh when we when we\'re thinking of <name/> really focussing on what we call the paradox in authority the fact that you constitute authority itself by suppressing you know freedoms and therefore he thinks of uh possibilities of subversion when those <O/> seem to you know to come home to <O/> as it were which I think is what Caliban tries sometimes to exploit in his contest with uh uh with Prospero But I don\'t know what the rest of you may maybe think about it Especially this element of authority Uh Because there is a whole process of trying to constitute a kingdom in this island uh with what we\'d call suppression of you know other freedoms like those of Caliban and the rest In a word I\'m inviting you to join in the discussion or any other issue that you want to raise not necessarily those of authority What is it that <name/> really calls the paradox of authority or exile which he sees as being represented in The Tempest by Shakespeare Yes Peter \n<$D> I think the whole issue that <name>/ is concerned especially <O_><O/> that part on Prospero Caliban he is trying to show that Prospero whatever he undergoes is not like he\'s a pioneer of it because the issue of the exile shows that even in Africa we had some kings who were in exile For example he gives that example of Asantehene and Churchill So that when Prospero comes it shows that that is like the imperial centre or now that the centre is coming to the periphery So in the periphery there is a form of ignorance so that innocently Caliban shows the secrets of the island So what Caliban is doing is that he\'s showing his true feelings There is no hypocrisy in him But the centre is portrayed as something hypocrisy because after being shown all the secrets the colonial subject is turned into a servant And this servant whatever language he\'s being given is only just enough to serve colonist master So that we see that what <name/> is trying to show is that the centre had nothing to offer the periphery and in fact he shows that all Prospero did was out of cruelty and revenge for what had happened to him in Milan\n<$C> Yes we are raising more and more interesting issues I don\'t know if there\'s anybody who wants to respond directly to Given the kind of uh dimension that was given to the discussion uh especially in terms of religion <O_><O/> <name/>\n<$A> <O_><O/> referring to you know says that uh in a sense Caliban presents him so as a challenge to Prospero Uh What do do you make of that uh In what sense is Caliban as understood by <name/> in what sense is he a challenge actually to Prospero Is it in terms really of uh strengh authority which I think is not the case here It comes out clearly you know in the play itself and I think Prospero keeps on getting disturbed with this idea of indefinable creature before him and yet it is something he cannot just say You are not there You do not exist He does exist and he exists as a challenge Uh And I think <name/> says something about that What did you think about it at least for those who have read the extract A challenge as what you know', 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> <O_><O/> making sure that uh corruption is eradicated in our society Like in our Kenyan context we find that corruption is one of the ways by which uh drug trafficking can actually be motivated And uh if corruption is controlled such that them that are caught in the act of a drug trafficking are dealt with as uh a law I think uh by that way we will be able to curb the drug effect in the society\n<$B> <O_><O/> suggesting that most of the drugs that come into this country the authorities are aware but a few people are bribed so that they \n<$B> Yeah there is some loopholes in the security Such that these things the drugs are allowed to enter into the country All the drug trafficking goes on and the government is not aware that Actually these people the government officials are actually aware that such things are continuing They are going on but because of the money hungry uh money hunger they continue getting this money and then the drug trafficking continues \n<$B> Okay but what would you think of a policeman for example who is paid about two thousand shillings a month or at the most five This man is dealing with a millionaire who is the drug trafficker This millionaire offers this poor policeman to give him a hundred thousand something he never dreamt of or thought it would ever come across his hands I don't know how the rest of you think If that policeman is faced with that temptation of that one hundred thousand shillings so that he can let drugs pass After all even if he does not allow somebody else will allow it to happen I don't know what the rest of you <$?> Now Whatever you say is really true but also we are to take it from another aspect that is You might've heard recently uh hashish valued at more than two million was caught somewhere in Kenya Funnily enough the persons who are involved they are government officers a DO in fact \n<$B> Yeah\n<$?> Now here's a situation where we're not only <O_><O/> talking of surely the person having been underpaid But as much as the <$B> Yeah\n<$?> Then it means therefore that the government being the biggest employer should at least try to set up job conditions which are suitable for any persons if that then will kill what we can otherwise call the temptations in life We can't avoid them They are there But at least the working conditions should be set in such a way that such like temptations are really minimal\n<$B> Okay That was his point that the best things to ensure that we avoid corruption on the entry point of the country so that we can be able to take care of those who bring the drugs illegally \n<$?> Yeah One of the one of the issues that I think should be catered for is As you talk of the cop who accepts a bribe Such a cop should be eliminated We should try to a certain level to eliminate such cop I think drugs trafficking will be reduced this way In this issue what I want to think What I want to say is for example if you take care of the street children and look at them specifically you see that the majority comes from the <O_><O/> his standards of life is raised The thing is that such a person would be able to take his children to school or her children to school And then I tend to think that because the highest population of drug traffickers are people who have grown up in streets Those who have been brought up in such conditions they are they'll definitely change That will beat the number of drug traffickers\n<$B> As in their suggestions you have a point as well But incidentally as I mentioned in the morning most of the drug traffickers are well-to-do people Let's take the example of the Mombasa drug haul of two billion Which street man can afford two two billion worth of drug to bring into the country It's not uh we are talking of uh monies that go to the rate of two billion We are saying that even people who are earning a salary of twenty thousand shillings a month compared at that rate of income they are at a temptation also\n<$?> Well uh in such a case I would say it's one thing to sell the frugs and the receiving it's another thing The receiving <O_><O/> For example you find that those street children those people who live in the street the poor families and all these are the ones who have been troubled by taking the drugs themselves The problem especially if we are dealing with drug addiction which means that those people at the far end are the one who have problems Anyway if we could we should consider also the far end \n<$?> <ea/>Sawa but We notice as a fact that people who drug-traffic are not uh the same people who take the drugs For instance the example about the Mombasa drug haul We find that the person who got in all those tons of uh drugs is uh not really the person who is going to take it uh So uh what I would say is that uh actually drugs permeate you know all areas of society The rich take it The poor take it you know uh Such that we will not really come up with any tangible uh you know solution to drugs Drugs are there to stay \n<$B> Are you suggesting what we are doing we're looking for solutions is that we basically we are doing nothing\n<$?> Uh actually let's not cheat ourselves Uh The best we can do is to try and educate people of on the bad aspects of drugs But even in education we find that in the universities the pinnacle of intellectualism we find drugs are being taken there uh So okay The solution in this drug war is actually education you know changing the people's uh frame of mind concerning drugs but not necessarily increasing people's income That will only give them more money for drugs <$B> Okay Now uh That was one way of bridging the gap between the poor and the rich And also his point maybe as we have said earlier is that most of the people who end up taking drugs have other problems that lead them to taking drugs That is the person maybe uh doesn't have a job he's an idler Or the person is frustrated He comes from a broken-up family and he has no hope in anything else So because of that he seeks for refuge in drug taking So maybe among those ones who come from that calibre of those who are pressed to drugs by poverty and frustrations that are money-related they may end up in that Let's get the last one Now that we go to something else so that we can get something else\n<$?> Okay Me I think that uh the families should play a very important role because one of the causes of drug addiction is that children are influenced by their peer groups So if parents can play a role of being responsible and educating their children making sure they know where they are going and what they are doing I think it can be eradicated \n<$?> Okay that's Do you know that many parents do not like even to mention drugs to their parent because it may be out of that curiosity that the child would go to look for those drugs to see like you have no intentions of taking heroin for example but you wouldn't mind seeing how it looks like Just the way we don't like dead people But if you are told somebody is dead somewhere you will all go to see him And your seeing does not bring that person back Like in the same case when you introduce the same the issue of drugs to your children some of them instead of getting uh corrected they might say uh Why is mom or dad so concerned about this And that one might end up making them try And that is the same problem we have with sex education in Kenya Churches are arguing that if those issues are mentioned to them some of the people who not have had a chance to hear are now going to have a chance to hear and then try it \n<$?> Sir uh actually I have a point to add onto that You know at times you find that uh taking a drug can be an a necessity It can actually be dictated by your circumstances Here I'm talking about uh in the past MUSO elections we had Okay I was going in for a chairman of MUSO Uh And uh actually me I'm an anti-drug you know uh\n<$B> advocate \n<$?> So I We found ourselves in a situation where the first <ea/>kamukunji we had Okay The my opponents that had taken uh you know hard liqueur <ea/>chang'aa had given them to uh they had given them to their you know supporters So we are going for the <ea/>kamukunji and you know the supporters came and all that You know my opponents they had an edge you know <O_><O/> But me I did have the drugs in my system I must say And uh Okay I went there and uh I was awkward So the second <ea/>kamukunji we had I thought now how do I solve this problem Yeah I live around the Kikuyus I'm a Luo and uh they take <ea/>chang'aa So when I entered uh another's room you know they were taking <ea/>chang'aa just preparing for the <ea/>kamukunji So I thought might this not be the solution to my nervous problem So I took two sips \n<$B> Of <ea/>chang'aa \n<$?> Of <ea/>chang'aa \n<$B> For the first time in your life \n<$?> For the first time in my life So this uh why I could a almost feel it going down and then entering my system and so I felt good And then in the LT three And I could speak I tell you I spoke freely Then in the third <ea/>kamukunji now I knew the solution to this Now I got my own worth twenty shillings You see \n<$B> Yeah\n<$?> So I took it and went in for the <ea/>kamukunji yeah So I had all my comfort Before I had the points uh I took the <ea/>chang'aa I had to you know get my points right what I'm going to talk about Then I took it and just to calm me down Then I went in And my speaking was eloquent Yeah And in fact you know the crowd could uh When they started jeering at me you know I shout to overrule their shouting You see so I managed to get my points across Uh But that is not to say that uh you know I take drugs But it was out of necessity And I know that uh drugs you know circumstances can really dictate that you take them \n<$B> Are you suggesting there are some problems their only solution is taking drugs \n<$?> Can be taking drugs Like that one Which other solution is there \n<$?> Now sir I suppose that uh Or we can see how our society's taking changes The next time <O_><O/> But that's besides the point What I'm raising is this I suppose a way of which we can now help uh curb out this drug is to solve it from the consumption point of view Because we can't have producers without consumers That is I'm reasoning now from my economics point of view We can't have producers without consumers If we discourage the consumption then we are going to handle the production and the pushing of the drugs Now that therefore goes back to the punishment which is given to the pushers and the consumers Now I suppose that instead of punishing the consumers and the pushers we should get a way in which we handle these people Because if you want to punish me today the next day I just feel that if I want to hurt you is to do the same thing so that you repeat the same thing As you were saying in the morning that some people just do this so that they can be punished That therefore means that we should then start rehabilitation schools instead of setting up so many jail centres to curb the whole drug uh problem", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> introductory speech which will also give the meaning of that display Yeah Displaying is actually to arrange uh spread out for public view The days are gone when people go to their bookshops as if they're entering a mysterious shrine to meet some frightening gods But in most bookshops half the battle is won when a shopper picks up the books on show if by the formality of the display he feels the slightest put off you lose him There is a great need to display stock in ways that tempt your customer So you without much ado why don't we go straight to window displays To start with the displays should be the windows should be lively and attracting to catch the interest of a passer-by who doesn't know anything about current books What do I mean by that When somebody's just passing uh outside the windows of your bookshop if they are tidy and attractive then even if he knows nothing about what is current and whatever you have kept there which is current he can see Then I think you are attracting him to the bookshop and that is what display's meant Second point Unless you are doing solo window displays try and put in as many related titles as possible not just one copy of each Third one Try to break up the regularity by stacking books upon one another Building up towers of the same book of the same size books but of different titles Basically what I mean is that you are having a book on uh zoology and there are different titles because there are different approaches by different authors who <O/> different topic You can just display them one over the other but as if you are building towers so that face forward so that everybody can see and Unless you are just doing a solo display Or rather what I mean by a solo display is that for each window <O/> bookshop You are having uh English books they're only maybe by a certain writer Ngugi wa Thiong'o On the second window you are just having uh by Mwangi <name/> That way unless you are doing that kind of work for a generalised display I think it's the point advises us to pile them up that way so that the related ones can be brought together for the users to have a choice Let's come to the third aspect Uh Sometimes it's uh advisable to make it a bit a little difficult to read a little difficult to read what is in the display but not too difficult to chase away those who <O/> to uh the would-be purchasers of the book Because it is a bit stimulating to see how people crane their necks and trying to struggle to see what is there in the display And that and by so doing they <O/> and attract crowds to your bookshop \nWe go to the second to the other aspectI know it's a bit difficult to relate Whatever is in your display let's say it's a such a book which is here So if I want to display this book Maybe by the writing the type of writing I will choose for that particular set of books in that window You might put them in a way that the writing may be below the <O/> of colours Then something appears different in a different colour Right Then by so doing somebody who is coming to see to view those books in the those books through the window maybe he'll strain a bit from a far distance He'll be straining and be craning his neck to see what is there So when he is straining that way he is attracting crowds \n<$B> What about what about if the books that have titles written in uh big print you put them right at the back of the display And you have those ones written in small print brought just near the glass of the window so that those ones which are in the back cannot be read from afar Somebody will have to come next to the window and maybe uh try to peep past the books that are in front to see what is at the back\n<$A> That's that's quite good \n<$C> to make it to make it a little difficult to read what's on display I don't According to your definition of display I do not quite agree with that Because if you make it difficult for the person who is looking at that particular book to read he might go away He might get another bookshop that will place these books so nicely you are able to read the titles You are just attracted because uh <O/> you make it difficult to read \n<$D> I think the point he's trying to put across is very genuine because you find that if it's a little bit difficult for you to read you spend more time there By spending more time the passer-by becomes curious What is this guy concentrating to do here Why don't Why don't I also \n<$C> In the world of today whereby time is a rare commodity Just want to read something and go by it and disappear Why should why I go to a bookshop and spend twenty minutes just trying to scan what has been What is this that this person is trying to display\n<$?> If those writings are far away from you you would wish to see what's that that is written there So you move closer In the process of your moving closer you are attracting those who are passing around <O_><O/> So it's probably <O/> a little bit difficult Not that it should be difficult That's <$?> So you find it a little bit difficult so that\n<$?> Not to read not to read but to attract others yeah\n<$?> Because for the one who is being attracted he's not far away In fact he's just so close to the window So he's just craning to see what is just right at \n<$B> And I think actually what is likely to result from that is that that person may even get inside the shop to be able to uh read that book more comfortably He gets it from the shelf and reads it from a close range \n<$?> So we proceed with our discussion \n<$?> animation or any amusing style relevant to the subject to stop crowds In this point we know the You know the use of the placement of cards in shops to attract people They just make an amusing sight that you just want to see what's actually there But even in this case you can employ the use of marionettes relevant to the subject You can have a marionette You know marionettes They are pieces of <O/> sort of dolls that seem to be dancing So you can have a marionette maybe in a mathematical in mathematics books display You see they'll attract crowds They are amusing so people will come to watch And by watching they'll see this is standard eight mathematics secondary mathematics And they are attracted to your shop \n<$D> Excuse me Uh You said that the relationship be relevant to the topic you are trying to display \n<$A> Where possible\n<$D> Where possible I think you should have added that statement because I've seen most cases it's always contrast For example you find a bookshop You find they put uh uh uh uh not a marionette maybe a crocodile You wonder what uh uh how crocodiles are related to books But because of that curiosity why are crocodiles put in such a display You see what is being displayed maybe it's a book on it's just a book \n<$A> He's right And windows should be as clean and fresh as possible Dusty dirty scrubby and muddy copies which are a disgrace to the shop should be banned from windows at all times Copies which are dusty almost mugged up with mud <O/> which are folded at the edges they are actually a disgrace People will wonder whether you are selling second-hand books They should be not uh displayed in the windows Because a window display is a in fact is the gateway to your bookshop So also you should group books by subject in a solo type of display window The other point is that ensure that anyone who looks into the window can also look through right into your shop What do I mean The way you place your books in that window display will have to be in such a way that people can also see what is in the shop seeing through When I look through the display window I can also see through the shop Let those who are outside know that's even better inside Now they are tempted to step right inside the into the \n<$D> Excuse me How do you do that Because you know some windows uh so some windows reflect your image So if you put that uh which type of window should be there You should also specify because maybe if you put it straight it reflects you but if you put it slant uh maybe slanting so you can see through so your image maybe is reflected somewhere else\n<$?> maybe you can use uh the type of the windows that you can that's reflecting the image because you'll not be seeing the book displays \n<$?> I think this case to many <O_><O/> let's say this is a real display Then in case the pane is already transparent so you can see you can see through But then inside the shelves or the rack for displaying the books in that window display are slanted so that they don't entirely block behind And to add on that do curtains Do away with bad dusty curtains that will shop So uh you see it's a almost a very common phenomenon in many bookshops You find that if there's a window display and right by the books there's almost a blockage there because there are dark curtains there You see they screen the viewer from seeing right through the shop I think that's not advisable as far as bookshop uh displays are concerned \n<$B> And if I may comment on that Sometimes depending on the premises that you get people If you are not lucky you may not get a shop that has a window And you may decide to have a window constructed after you've got in that building So some people end up even building walls after the window inside the bookshop so that when you look from outside you only see the books that are on the display on the window display Then after that you see a wall You don't see anything else So that is what actually should be avoided You make sure that there is free space it's quite open right from the window to the other end of the wall \n<$?> And to avoid congestion for new titles you display them cover first that is face forward And then for the other old titles which are still selling pending you can just display them by maybe spine first that the spine can be visible But for the most current ones make sure that you display them forward face forward that is Okay we now we proceed there now right into the shop assuming that our customer has been enticed into the bookshop And now he is willing to purchase or to see more of what you have inside So shelves tables and special displays these carry the stock that our customers are to buy Any table display that is <O_><O/> purpose You see there are some displays inside the shop now that just looks too formal Maybe they're so impeccably clean that a customer or a would-be customer fears to even touch them Then they are failing in their purpose Let them Let the customers see that these ones are for their use They are there for them to touch and even to handle them the way they like because that's their sole business and the customer is the vital aspect in any kind of business", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'ca2343f4-3ad9-4bf5-8e0f-9ab4e83062c7', 'added':

{'text': "<$A> Thank you Now I want to discuss briefly the phonological level Yes and I'm going to read a small poem entitled Ollifant Now first of all I want to comment about the musicality of this poem because due to the effect of alliteration and repetition and the rhymes okay This kind of musicality in the first place makes the child derive pleasure from this kind of poem and therefore the child rather is encouraged is encouraged to keep on reading and reading and reading the poem The child is encouraged to read the poems and in that course of reading the poems the child uh comes across different structures of language different words of language and therefore that builds his linguistic  competence And that's all we are interested in Now apart from that the child also learns to distinguish closely related words as we found in the poem for example ears and years round ground mouth south and so on and so forth Okay So these closely related words uh The child learns to distinguish these closely related words And also I'm interested in uh in the paradigmatic contrast in these kind of words The child learns that although these words are so closely related as far as pronunciation is concerned they are they are very they a they have very different meanings So that closeness in pronunciation or even the same pronunciation does not necessarily mean that the words mean the same okay So the child comes to understand this kind of difference through the poem and therefore this also has a way goes into uh improving his linguistic  competence Orthographically these words are as you've seen like in this poem of elephant of elephant uh mouse house grass trees as you all realised are very commonplace words they're things that are just around okay And I would say are words which the child in one time or more often than not will want to use them either in writing or in speaking And especially in writing because uh uh if a child wants to express himself through writing then he has to know the he has to know the spelling of these words So what I'm saying is such a text also helps the child to know the the theRRR spelling of the words of the common or the words that are very common so that he can use them in his in his communication Now if we look at this poem of uh the poem I've just read to you The Little Fish The Little Fish In this kind of poem we have basically three characters We have the mother fish the little fish and I will say uh is it they call it the persona or something In other words there there's a kind of a dialogue in this kind of text okay And in the dialogue of course the mother fish and the little fish speak different at least as far as the tone is concerned So uh through through reading this poem the child uh uh the child tries to fit into the various characters that are portrayed in the text okay And he speaks he has to assume different roles in order to portray the right kind of emotions and the right kind of message So through doing this the child uh through doing this the voice modulation and all that the child uh the child builds his emotions And he's able and he knows that communication is not just about just words or sentence structures of anything it also has to do something with emotions okay It has to do with emotions And again role play if you look at this kind of text again role play that it helps a child to get the feel of things okay Because as I've said as the child tries to fit into the different roles and express different emotions he learns how to express himself emotionally okay He learns how to express himself emotionally And therefore uh this also I believe goes into uh improving the the child's  competence in language Any comment as far as that is concerned Now of course lexically if you look at the lexical level of this you'll realise that as you've said the words are very commonplace words the house the mouse the grass the mouth the ears and so on And so the child learns the basic vocabulary okay And he not only learns them he also learns how to spell them okay So uh so that when the child wants to use them when the child wants to write he can write them without making mistakes And that is all that uh  competence in language is all about I invite questions Yes Epher\n<$B> Maybe if it if I did hear that in order to discuss I have not really seen the meaning part of how the child learns meaning from language in most of what you've been saying Are there any instances whereby the child gets meaning to really get the meaning of the language like through a poem how does he conceptualise meanings of things and all that or it doesn't appear in linguistic competence \n<$A> Okay I talked a bit about meaning especially when I was talking about uh the cognitive level But my view of meaning was this my view of meaning is that I first I said that the child uh children learn language by associating it with meaning that's what I was saying And so uh even though certain terms within the texts might not be very uh he might not be able to understand such uh such terms or words okay But uh through or with within that context the child is able to will be able to get the meaning of such terms and therefore he builds his competence and I gave an example of keeping vigil although the child did not know what to keep vigil is what to keep vigil means yeah but within that context he still can be able to understand what it means\n<$C> Let me say Okay that's my I have a different view about how a child can get the meaning of words not only from the context We have like for example the onomatopoeic words And we know with the onomatopoeic words we get the meaning out of kind of we perceive the sound of the word and now we associate that sound with the really with the reality the the theRRR physical reality that we have For example let's say we have a word like the rock falling with a thud and that I don't know how he knows it because there is an there is no <O/> at the end And uh the child does not know the meaning of that thud But I think he can picturise how that rock fell and I think it's through such an onomatopoeic word the child can derive the meaning So I think that it's not only the context that can help a child to get the meaning but also the nature of the words themselves like for example onomatopoeic words Also for example we have these words with sibilants for example with these hissing sounds like buzz and any other sibilant I would feel also because they also appear like onomatopoeic words they can also enable the child to get the to get the meaning of the word I don't know that's my feeling \n<$B> Yeah okay uh I agree So far we had the meaning of the words that was concerned But now I was talking about the whole text like that poem of the fish Does the child now can the child understand like if you go against your mother's orders something bad can happen to you You know like is that meaning more of linguistic or is it <O_><O/>\n<$A> Now tell us what you think Do you think this meaning is more linguistic\n<$B> I think in linguistic competence it counts Like in the child really gets to know the gist of the poem and all just apart from knowing the meanings of the words and the sounds and the whatever you have discussed which is okay \n<$A> Okay\n<$B> You also know the gist of the poem so you understand and that is also linguistic competence\n<$A> So what the child comes to know that uh it's not just uh linguistic structures it also has to do with the meaning So actually uh in in in inRRR communication the child has to know that he has to communicate I mean \n<$B> Yeah I'm asking is it okay \n<$A> Yeah I think it is Unless anyone else Yes\n<$?> I think now the discussion we must digress a bit here There's the problem of a kid who is trying to learn L one and one is trying to learn L two Now the question there seem to be having problem with a kid learning an L two <ea/>sio so that he doesn't know the meaning of the words so for the first time he's trying to <O/> from other things Now what of a kid who is learning L one who already knows the meaning of such words \n<$?> I'm not sure if I'm getting you the question right\n<$?> The question is this We have a kid who is learning language Now language can be learned from two perspectives You it can be a kid who is that one now is English <ea/> sio What of if it was an English kid who is trying to learn his own language or mother tongue Then there is one who is an African like you who is a young kid trying to learn English Now in that case I think context would be more relevant to a kid who is learning L two than the kid who is already learning mother tongue Now a kid who is learning mother tongue already knows the words Now there must be something else he's looking for maybe like sequence or anything \n<$?> Yeah I think I get what he's trying to say uh you know the question that she posed was Is there much more to I mean uh is I mean meaning How does meaning come out of that text and uh you have we've tried to get uh an understanding Now the question he is asking is that suppose there is this child who uses the native tongue and he already knows the meanings of these words and everything uh he knows the meaning apart form that is there an aspect or other aspects of language that the child learns out uh uh of this text of the poem I just read And of course I think the answer is yes There is much more I think language is a very wide thing and there are so many other things people have to learn all the time And so I think some of the things we pointed out when we were dealing with the phonological level other aspects such as what uh the sense of what uh spelling and so many other things that you were talking about are uh crucial here uh The child learns other ways about how to speak the language how to write it down how to you know uh distinguish between certain words that are common and that kind of thing that have certain features but that are almost similar So I think there are are there areRRR so many things that a child can learn even if he already knows the meaning of those words So that uh of course we are saying at the end of the day we are talking about meaning You have to communicate But again we are also talking about the process of tackling of getting to the meaning the structure of the language and learning so many aspects about uh the structure of the language So I think uh this question is just a way of asking what other aspects are there apart from uh just doing this for basic meaning And I think it's part of what you are doing now What are can a child gain from uh the poem itself Then I also wanted to point out that there are also other things the child can learn when we're talking about meaning because I think meaning is a very wide thing", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'f5efa9dc-30dc-4899-a477-df789f8f7885', 'added':

{'text': "You must have got that from you your literature and corpus planning So you can deliberately make the language a prestige language even when it was just uh a mere vernacular So Nyerere with his charisma gave Kiswahili status Not that it was a status uh it was uh uh first a status symbol and then imposed on the others Do you see the difference So it is different from what is happening or what happened in Kenya So if you are comparing Kenya and Tanzania English and Kiswahili then you must have all this in mind because you're talking about politics and politics is ideology What is the political ideology of Kenya What was the political ideology of Tanzania <$B> I think it's uh clear now The ideology of uh political ideology of Tanzania was based on socialism \n<$A> Egalitarianism everybody seemed to be important and then it is politics of participation from the grassroots and you you yourself said that the minimal unit political unit and economic unit in Tanzania was the village They were already using Kiswahili way before the legalisation Kiswahili was not imposed on them they were already using the language So it was quite different from the Kenyan situation By the by nineteen sixty-seven when they were declaring Kiswahili the national language or the official language Kiswahili was already wide-spread around the country \n<$C> I think maybe we should give him time to talk about the Kenyan case before we\n<$A> But you know the Kenyan case don't you Ben is not going to give you that now is he Ben Okay give then just an overview of what uh the situation is in Kenya \n<$B> Now the situation in Kenya is uh is slightly different is actually different from the Tanzanian one I think when we talk about uh politics we're talking about ideology So the approach at the Kenyan independence in nineteen sixty-three was kind of uh that capitalist orientation but uh as I said earlier the first president of Kenya had always been stressing on the use of Kiswahili language as a national language in Kenya only that uh it's never matured and it has not matured up to now because of some reasons Now in nineteen sixty-four for example uh I gave that example earlier it is after addressing the first Kenyan parliament when Kenya became a republic uh Kenyatta himself used the English language but at the end of his speech he decided to augment it with uh a few words in Kiswahili And he said that uh a time has come or a time had come at that time to start using Kiswahili language at the national level And according to him uh something has to start somewhere So according to him the use of Kiswahili language has to start from the Kenyan parliament He proposed uh the discarding of foreign languages such as English uh to proclaim what he referred to as proper independence So if Kenya had uh become independent from the British uh forces then it had to look for a language that was more of an African language to use in its government policies But uh the problem came in that unlike Tanzania Kenya had a capitalist's political ideology It uh had uh a balance uh its balance was more towards the West than uh the case of Tanzania which was more towards the Eastern bloc maybe if you can remember the division of the world at that time in the Eastern bloc and the Western bloc So the Western bloc uh type of capitalism which was being adopted by the young nation in Kenya was that of using the language of the former colonial power So in Kenya it became inevitable that English occupied that special place of its uh in its political ideology at that time unlike Tanzania which discarded the use of English immediately at independence but Kenya continued using the English language to promote or to proclaim its political ideology Kenyatta tried so much to introduce Kiswahili as the president of Kenya He even uh stage-managed I call it stage-managing the introduction of motions in parliament to declare the Kiswahili language as the language of parliament such that it becomes the language of uh use mass use in Kenya This was uh attempted in nineteen sixty-nine when a motion in parliament passed by uh one MP at that time to declare Kiswahili the language of the government debate in parliament or parliamentary debate So it's never succeeded of course at that time And later on the ruling party at that time and after this time is KANU so at that time it was the sole ruling party uh proposed in its governing council of nineteen seventy that nineteen seventy-four was going to be the year for the *Swahlanization> of Swahilianisation of Kenya So they they wanted to introduce Kiswahili as the language of Kenya by nineteen seventy-four that was in nineteen seventy in a three-phase plan according to what they gave So when nineteen seventy-four reached nothing much had been done about this So since it was a government uh a governing council declaration or proposition Kenyatta decided to make or to give a presidential decree that uh from now that was in nineteen seventy-four Kiswahili was going to be used in parliament So it was a presidential decree It was not even something planned So it was overnight that Kiswahili had started to be used in the Kenyan parliament and uh there were so many effects on uh that were brought about by this presidential decree Because according to the literature I've come across many of the MPs at this time members of the parliament did not have proficiency in Kiswahili Of course there were a few who had proficiency in Kiswahili and no proficiency in English but the majority of them had proficiency in the English language And the language that was supposed to be used uh before somebody is nominated to parliament or nominated to contest a seat was English language So here the president comes and declares that Kiswahili language is going to be used here and it caused a problem It also it is also seen that uh in uh the struggle for independence many of the political parties at that time I think we had the main political parties KADU and KANU had used Kiswahili language in uh uh propagating their policies in trying to be the leading political parties I think this implies that uh the political parties themselves were aware of the fact that uh Kiswahili language was much more understood or was much more spread among the masses than uh the English language was So it was ironical that at independence the same political parties I think KANU had now merged with KADU in nineteen sixty-four But it became ironical that instead of adopting the language they were using in propagating their policies in the field that is uh among the electorate they now decided to adopt the English language as the official language of Kenya because of the ideology that was capitalist ideology Now in nineteen seventy-nine I think Kenya had uh entered in its second phase now Uh Kenyatta was uh already out so he had died and we had uh a new president in nineteen seventy-nine So the government of Daniel arap Moi introduced a new bill in parliament from nineteen seventy-four to nineteen seventy-nine it was only Kiswahili that was used in parliament So in nineteen seventy-nine the government of uh Daniel arap Moi introduced a bill in parliament which reintroduced the use of English language in parliamentary debate But this time it did not drop Kiswahili So it made the two languages as official languages in the debates of Kenyan parliament So the difference was that when a member asks a question in Kiswahili he should answer he should be answered in Kiswahili When a question is asked in English the reply should be in English That was the only difference But the two languages uh from nineteen seventy-nine I think up to now are the official languages of the Kenyan parliament Nevertheless Moi himself has continued using Kiswahili in his political platforms I think that was from Leitham He has continued using uh Kiswahili in his uh political platforms And he has always\n<$A> That didn't have to come from Leitham because you are better placed to say that It didn't have to come from Leitham Because you are better placed to say to tell us that You listen to him every day on TV and radio <$B> Yeah but uh the uh of late he has been using other languages hasn't he <$A> That's why it should come from you not from Leitham Leitham is in uh Washington he doesn't know that he's using other languages \n<$B> Okay but he stresses that uh Leitham himself stresses that uh Moi has been against the use of foreign languages in Kenya and uh he has always been saying that the use of foreign languages uh is a kind of colonialism to him He says I think there is a line he quotes that uh the president once said that he cannot be ashamed to break the English language or the French language anything that is alien to him but he's very very particular about the use of his own language so he'll better use Kiswahili language the way it is supposed to be in standard form But if he uses the other language in any other way he's not moved about it so easily I think there are some lines that \n<$A> And you agree with Leitham \n<$B> He has given\n<$A> Do you agree with him \n<$B> He has even quoted lines from the president \n<$A> Yeah that's right Do you agree with him that's what I'm asking \n<$B> I didn't agree with him entirely \n<$A> Okay\n<$B> I didn't\n<$C> I mean the president breaks Kiswahili quite often \n<$D> <ea_> <ea/> <O_><O/> English \n<$B> So maybe Leitham is not he's not uh good in uh he maybe doesn't know Kiswahili himself Perhaps he may be we've been in a better place to judge the president's use of Kiswahili Now Kiswahili in Kenya has nevertheless been uh not been as well implemented as it has been in Tanzania English is still used in many official functions in Kenya It is used in courts of law It is the one that is used in the school the education system And uh because of uh this multiple use and functions I think English uh in Kenya becomes I think more I can call it a prestige language I think I'm reluctant to say this but in Kenya it is more a prestige language than Kiswahili is \n<$A> Why are you reluctant to say that \n<$B> I was reluctant because uh some of them will disagree with me \n<$A> And you don't like people disagreeing with you \n<$B> So English uh I think is more of a prestige language in Kenya than Kiswahili is But uh the government in Kenya has uh as I have said has always stressed on the use of the Kiswahili language that is why it is uh I think given equal time not equal time I think uh equal time now in the mass media radio television we have I think the two languages being used at the same time I don't know whether I can briefly talk about the example of Uganda I was using <O_><O> so all the examples were from the three countries all the time \n<$A> We don't have the time but uh I want to hear you react to what Ben has said because that is what is important \n<$B> I don't know\n<$A> I asked him to look at that work again because it didn't satisfy me his false presentation And that's why I gave him more <O/> Yeah", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source':

{'text': "<$C> Yeah in a sense there is a lot that's meant about that question of relationship uh I think comes out very clearly in The Tempest itself uh the text And I think <name/> also tries to do something about uh <name/> in fact goes further than that and you know asks the question What happens you know like uh he says Prospero has given Caliban language and then makes this statement and repeat with that gift of language unstated history of consequences and unknown history of future intentions And I think we are thinking of uh uh you know the post-*coloniality> that the condition that we are in now one must say something you know about that about what <name/> is saying What are these future intentions uh which which Prospero You remember of course Prospero says or is it Miranda it's Miranda actually there's always a problem in who made those statements of having taught uh uh Caliban language But remember that <O_><O/> you know problem between Prospero Miranda and Caliban on the other side that without language <O_><O/> and so forth And one thing that Prospero says is that uh you know in trying to give purpose to your intentions by giving you language so that language is not merely language you know the words that that we speak but more in terms of concepts in terms of uh ideas Of course these ideas being western and uh ideas uh of Prospero's culture So what is going to take place after all this you know What's going to that possibility of the relationship the bond between Prospero and Caliban where Prospero in most cases thinks Caliban uh could have raped he in fact attempted to rape Miranda And then there is that small discourse about what would have happened if that took place uh Caliban uh  Of course <name/> makes an issue from that I mean the other way round So I don't know what most of you would want to say on that relationship uh like the whole post-colonial history now Can you actually say these are the kind of intentions that uh <name/> is talking about Uh Caliban is taking place you know in the in the sixteenth or <O/> sixteenth century But then in the twentieth century we are actually seeing our own transformation of our people of Calibans you know for that matter I don't know whether most of you imagined that this is what <name/> uh was trying to imply by talking about this *unstated> uh history of consequences Is it the history of post-*coloniality> <O_><O/> I don't know there are issues that you want to raise so that <O_><O/>\n<$A> I think I would say in in connection to what uh we have just said about uh this uh what <name/> has called is calling an unknown it is an unknown history of future intentions Uh maybe when you think of that statement and you know that it uh against what we were doing this morning uh The Pantomime What can you say about it What can you say about that statement by <name/> uh in reference to Pantomime by Derek Walcott Do you see it as a fulfilment of that such a statement \n<$C> <O_><O/> you're still thinking about that uh <O_><O/> What about this issue that <name/> says Caliban contains the seed of revolt What do you make of that What does he mean that Caliban contains the seed I think of s e e d sorry of revolt of rebellion for that matter Yes\n<$?> I think what <name/> was trying to show is that He was showing he had a reference to the slaves who had been taken to Caribbean so that after the torture he underwent there was always that spirit of freedom He wanted to be free So that even when they were working he said some of them became leaders They led an uprising or something like that So some are killed but still in their position others arose So in Caliban there are two times when he tries to organise a revolution so that he once overthrew Prospero But the way he undergoes this is that he tries to use <name/> to seduce Stephano who is the drunkard But even the two do not have the purpose They don't know what this revolution is all about To them it's just an adventure so that what <name/> is seeing that the colonial subject in this case because of that need the urge for freedom he's always determined so that he shows it the way Caliban was detained in that <O/> so that that detention in itself gives the colonial subject time to think and reorganise himself so that even in detention that spirit is not killed but instead it is strengthened more So Caliban stands for that seed of revolt and that revolt is revolutionary in itself\n<$C> Yeah Yes please\n<$?> I also tend to think that that seed of revolt which <O_><O/> to be contained in Caliban Uh I think it refers to the awakening of this subject uh that gradually uh by using the language which Prospero gives him we see Caliban uh learning or praying We see Caliban stand up for his rights He tells Prospero that Prospero has misused uh the generosity of Caliban to mislead him Because we can say that initially it was him who <O/> Prospero on the island and showed him the good parts of the island Then after that it is when Prospero now turns things over and becomes the *enslaver> of Caliban So there is that awareness of disposition on the part of Caliban And then he knows that uh Prospero is oppressing him when he's not supposed to be doing that because the island belongs to him So gradually you see that uh Caliban begins to seek ways of trying to change this state of events so that he can now be the rightful owner of the island I think that is what refers to uh what is referred to as the that seed of revolt \n<$C> Yeah I guess so I mean throughout the play really the colonial discourse that Caliban knows is that of trying to assert uh the rights of ownership of the island I mean he keeps on singing this freedom song even though <O_><O/> Those of you who saw the film you can witness What comes out of him the music the everything the curses and so forth uh refer to this injustice that has been done to him But I think you know like the two of you are saying uh the paradox of it all is that you know no matter how we're trying to it's like as you're trying to suppress him you know the more the urge and the demand uh for freedom and justice becomes increasingly <O_><O/> for that matter uh But uh So that in this light you can look upon these things like uh even the very intentions the very purposes that are given expressions of words and speech by Prospero becomes to nothing but out of frustration and speech Once I know then my I know how to speak I would say that my intention from the very beginning was to to be free to be the owner of this island and so forth in a sense you can think about that although there is a little disservice but that's the case Of course this is You know <name/> is standing between the history that has come of colonial <O_><O/> and the consequences of colonialism and I think that's why he's is very free criss-crossing the borders uh talking about seeing parallels in all this uh the whole history of the Caribbean or the ancient history for example So there's that kind of uh uh free uh you know free collapsing of all these experiences Any other issue that you want to raise Yes please \n<$?> I have some questions about uh to pose to the presenter There is something she said about uh lack of guilt-conscience on the part of the imperialists Uh I did not quite get it clear Uh I don't know how this uh has a bearing on that the investment of new meaning in The Tempest Could you please maybe explain that to me \n<$A> When we were coming up with that point we realised that uh uh as we were saying that <name/> is trying to bring uh an analogy to the colonialism and what is the Shakespeare is trying to write about Such that uh when we saw that uh there is this boatsman no sorry captain who is composing a song whereas there are some people who are actually suffering in the shipment of uh those foes or those people who are supposed to be actually Uh okay As Prospero has an intention of actually civilising the people but they undergo so much suffering So to Prospero it doesn't matter whatever he's doing to whatever is going to happen to the people but provided they land in the island in the mission of civilising them And therefore the analogy was uh with this European shipment of uh with this African shipment of slaves to Europe Such that those people are actually They were subjected to so much uh so muchRRR problems but uh their colonisers had an intention of civilising them because they had this mentality that Africans are idle so you have to make them busy So by taking them to Europe they are making them busy but it doesn't matter the situation That's the <O_><O/>\n<$?> I can also add on that on the question of a new meaning in this So he tries to show the humanity and the inhumanity So Caliban in the book has been presented as not human He just lies in between and Prospero now is the human And you know that what makes a man human is his conscience so that but so that in this case we are <name/> subverts the situation showing that Caliban instead is the one who has this conscience because whatever he says he portrays his true feelings But Prospero in trying to discover the secrets of the island He was somehow using tricks so that at the end of it he has no guilt when he says that the colonial master or the imperial has no guilty conscience is that when Prospero discovered everything about the island he used that information for his benefit and the reward for knowing this is turning Caliban into a servant So that in the long run who is human between the two of them Who has the conscience \n<$C> Yeah There There's this other issue you know uh They prepare again for another possible tempest as they go back to Milan uh uh <O/> at least uh optimistic of the language of uh Ferdinand and Miranda But uh Caliban is left behind I don't know don't knowRRR if we can think about it especially with regard to what <name/> is saying You need not write another text you know by Shakespeare's <O_><O/> But I think that's basically what <name/> was trying to do anyway Why don't you begin from where Shakespeare ended in terms of the post colonial history which we are now experiencing And you know there's this issue you everybody departs and Caliban is left on the island Has he then finally taken possession of the island Uh What's the How do you read that <name/> says that Caliban is not going to be the same again after this conduct How do you understand that Why is he not going to be the same again and yet all these colonialists have <O_><O/> All these fellows have you know departed Why is he not going to be the same again What does he mean by that Could anybody try it say something about it What <.-/>What does he mean that that conduct was enough uh and Caliban is not going to be the same\n<$?> I think uh Caliban cannot be the same again because we notice that Prospero has a complete influence over him He completely changes him uh from a savage monster into a human being and that would be impossible of course So through that kind of changing of Caliban we notice that Caliban has now acquired language for instance and consequent to that is his way of conceptualising the environment as able to change So after uh Prospero and the other people leave the island and he remains on this island we definitely know that Caliban <O_><O/> that island the same way as he did before Prospero came onto the scene So I think that's why you can what really makes him say that Caliban will not be the same again", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$?> I remember I was reading another paper the other day It was saying that a mother had <O/> her son just because of drug The minute the kid told of uh the mother that he had been taken drug it was just too late By then it was it took only a few minutes or a few days before the boy finally hanged himself So such like situations are exactly what we're trying to avoid So instead of now setting up the punishment centres in the name of jails and the likes let us start uh rehabilitation centres And this therefore is uh involves every member of the society politicians environmentalists scientists sociologists linguists and name it So long as we are now having at least only one aim of solving the drug issue\n<$B> All right That would be a good issue or a good undertaking But remember we said in the morning that there are people who commit crimes so that they go to jail And when they are in prison for one month they ensure they commit another crime when they come out so that they go in Because in the jail they don't fetch for their own food They don't pay for shelter They don't care about clothes So if they were jailed for ten years they know those are ten trouble-free years I just sit in jail I eat Soon my stomach will adjust to the little portion of the food available Soon my body will adjust to the hard sleeping conditions And you know something becomes bad when you have a negative attitude towards it But you know you can choose not to sleep on a bed and sleep on the floor and be comfortable if it's your own choice The same case somebody who will go to prison because they want that they will not feel the punishment And we have people who have problems family difficulties what So if they know that they can be admitted into a rehabilitation home if they are known to be taking drugs and therefore they will have escaped from their homes and go to a better situation Don't you think we'll have more people taking drugs so that they can be admitted into such homes \n<$?> But sir I suppose that those who've been admitted to these homes will be a good example for the rest We've seen this in the past Now the reason why I'm so much against this whole issue of sending somebody to uh let's say jail is that when they go there even criminals they meet better criminals than they are and teach them even new techniques of committing even more serious crimes So by the time somebody leaves the prison he's even more harded criminal than he was when he went in So I suppose that if you take these people to rehabilitation centres as much as he feels that he should go there he will go there but then there he's not going to learn the new techniques of taking drugs But she is going to at least be taught of the new techniques of running away from the drugs So that would mean that if somebody goes there possibility of him changing there is uh uh higher then possibility of him changing when he is in prison \n<$B> Okay Good I think what we do now we write a few points so that uh then we can start something else But when it's discussed this way I'm sure when you face these kind of arguments you'll be better off One of the things that I would like to say Most of these are things we have discussed The first thing that should be done is that the State Department of Justice and Defence should cover all entry points as it has been said to ensure that importation of drugs is stopped or minimised Entry points should be covered to ensure that uh importation of these drugs is stopped or minimised Secondly the society should fight against the inhuman situations that lead to drug taking such as unemployment poverty and uh the issue of street children because these are the people who are used to experiment on anything Such that if the society fought such uh inhuman situations then you are sure that many people will be leading busy lives and they have no chance for drugs Thirdly I think that citizens should be entitled to clear education on the effects of drugs on themselves and the society The citizens should be entitled to clear education on the effects of drugs on themselves and on the society Like most drug takers think that what they They are taking their own drugs They are not affecting anybody else They are using their own money They are using their own bodies And therefore it does not affect anybody else So it It depends on them *Fourthly> there should be open reorientation clinics where addicts can be helped out of the problem This is where most people who are addicts instead of putting them into jail as one of uh our colleagues our friends has said here they should be given uh they should be given a chance where they will explain what led them to taking drugs so that you see whether it's a problem you can alter or it's something that you can take care of Like if somebody  ends up taking drugs because of being disappointed by a friend that is somebody who is different from somebody who ended up taking drugs because of family frustrations Because that one who ended up to drugs because of a friend he can always get another friend But that one who ended up taking drugs because of family problems you cannot get another family If you start another one you have now two families But if you're a member of a family you are a member forever So you saw that you see how even if it's a matter of linking the person with the family and see how you're going to take care of the situation Fifth heavy penalties should be imposed on drug traffickers and manufacturers Heavy penalties should be imposed on drug traffickers and manufacturers For example the seizing of their property The government if you are a drug trafficker and you are caught so that you can serve as a lesson to the others all your property The government should take it that you have <AmE>gotten your wealth from selling of drugs Therefore they should just get all your wealth And when you are poor and you will have no more money to go and import other drugs so if now you end up as a drug addict because of frustrations then now we can take you to a rehabilitation centre And if you are rehabilitated maybe you will stop taking the drugs Sixthly the youth should be encouraged to seek higher goals in life than pleasure and comfort The youth should be encouraged to seek higher goals in life than pleasure and comfort So that what one is looking for is just feeling nice And as soon as one has found comfort You come from a family that is wealthy you will have a car and you did not work for it You have money you did not work for it You just go to either your father's or your mother's shop you open the cash box and get two or three hundred put in your pocket And uh the employee cannot stop you because maybe you are the only child And the only way to correct you is if you change your own goals Such that it is not anybody now changing you so that you see you have your own respectable life to lead But when you think you are living for other people or all your dreams are ever one day having a car When you find you have that car and a posh house if there are posh houses for that matter If when you find you have them that  means you don't need anything else you can go drinking You can take drugs And the situation where you'd not know the effects people land up in problems Unless somebody has a question on that affair I'd like that we go to something else so that we start our discussions on homosexuality and lesbianism Our friends might be wondering what we learn in this class We seem to be dealing with the negative issues that is the morality things that uh affect our society Yes \n<$?> I think that uh if let's say drug has to be eradicated then we even have to stop let's say uh uh diplomats you know in the higher hierarchy of uh the government from let's say taking uh you know refreshments like whiskey you know such a liqueur you know Because actually uh drug you cannot really define a point that uh this is where you know uh uh let's say such innocent liqueur stop and this is where drugs begin yeah So inasmuch as we may want to educate uh people on drugs but uh we can only reduce the number of drugs but we can't eliminate it It's part and parcel of society \n<$B> There is as you said there is one problem i e that the government gets a lot of taxes from uh such drugs as alcohol In our context it falls under drugs because its effects are almost similar to the other drugs It will cause family uh  breakage It will cause character disorientation and all those kind of things But if you imagine the kind of money the government gets from Kenya Breweries you'd be joking to tell the Kenyan government to ban Kenya Breweries so that people stop taking beer And furthermore the policy makers our politicians most of them are drunkards They need it the way he needed it So that they can tell us lies and not feel guilty you see They will need that one And when we talk of diplomats or people let's say representatives of other governments in Kenya Those ones have some sort of immunity You don't interfere very much with their private affairs You We have a case at hand The Rwandan diplomat who was accused of uh attempting murder When the government refused to undress him of the immunity so that now the Kenyan government can put him into court the best they could is deport him They couldn't put him in court of law So that is the kind of security that diplomats have because without that one you cannot be sure of the security of your people whom you have put everywhere You have some in America Canada where Saudi Arabia If you are not sure that nobody will interfere with them you will not have so many diplomats scattered all over the world But you know even if they're commit they're committing a crime it will be waited until they have finished their work or the government response will be to withdraw them from those countries When they have been withdrawn then they are going to be accused But you cannot be anywhere then you'll be caught and put in So we are saying that such people if they are taking drugs in their place if they come here where they stay is part of their country by the way The compounds they have been given that is part of their country Therefore if they are free to be taking drugs in Canada or America or where when they get to that residence of their own they are as free as they were when they were in their country to do what they want to They have no obligation to change their character because they are in Kenya for example So they'll be free to take whiskey Whatever else hard alcohols they want to take or dry gins as they are called They will be free \n<$?> So in other words <O_><O/> uh should not just be <O_><O/> but also drugs We can't escape it\n<$B> Uh It's difficult all right but what we are saying is it's something that needs attention At least especially drugs that get to a limit of spoiling a family an individual is something that should concern should concern us And for leisure purposes alcohol still remains moral \n<$?> Yeah I think this point of youth being encouraged to seek higher goals It's like these are idealistic views since that how can we be able to uh help them have a higher uh higher goals of life since especially <O_><O/> a person comes to drug addiction", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source':

pile them up and then the customer can just come for any or he is just struggling to get any book from the pile then your stocks will come rumbling down and then there'll be chaos You'll not end up selling the book because the customer will get frightened maybe And avoid stacking old copies on their fore edge so that only their spine is showing Try to feature the books in your window displays fairly close to the door This is very important Then the customer gets the book which he has seen he or she has seen just outside there when he was outside is the one he first meets when he enters inside the shop So that is that one offers proximity advantage to the customer uh and it serves to reduce congestion and uncertainty on the part of the customer \n<$?> that prevents your customer from entering the shop most of the time Wouldn't it be better for us to indicate that this book that you are just seeing is a bit ahead so that he can enter and as he's walking through then he'll see other titles\n<$?> I think we are coming to that but\n<$?> I think once again <$?> You see <O/> want you to get the copy you saw immediately 'cause that means you have seen it and press through the shop <$?> It's a possibility But it's always advisable that the book we are seeing outside there he sees it right inside when he get he gets in But you can have the cashier situated somewhere inside so that when he is just going to pay he'll still be passing through amidst some other books So he can be seeing other possible copies which can <O_><O/> \n<$?> Excuse me That's uh I think that's limited because you are assuming we're displaying only maybe a new title Suppose you have so many titles on display You don't know what I want I've seen it in the display So you can't really say okay can't really sayRRR okay let me put this one next to the entrance so that you can just see it So I think uh Victor's point is valid You If you can be So long as it's in the display it is somewhere in the shop You can go round in fact it can even be better to hide it the copy he wants so that as he goes looking for it he sees other titles \n<$?> Okay it's valid yes but then we proceed to the other <O/> that point describe it further So if we are displaying a wide selection from the stock as <name/> has just said that for example you have very many books okay It is advisable to try and have a typed list available so that the customer who asks for a particular book can be sent immediately to the correct location in the shop Is it clear \n<$?> Come again\n<$?> I'm saying if we are displaying a wide selection of the stock in the window try to have a typed list available so that the customer who asks for a particular book can be sent immediately to the correct location in the shop \n<$B> 'Cause that is on assumption that you have a very big bookshop uh \n<$?> Yes \n<$B> with uh different types of books on stock 'Cause normally the practice is those people who are selling those who are the shop attendants usually take customers around uh even after maybe reading from the book where a specific book is located So unless you have quite many books you only Normally you find that they know different uh locations for various titles and they just lead the customer to where the book is located \n<$?> Make use of tables of even shapes especially round-topped tables These tables are very important because they make customers go round and round in a sort of vicious circle while looking for their books And so they hold them quite a bit for a while and then this may gives them time to make choices and to see even others for which they develop interest Has anyone of you ever noticed such an arrangement of tables\n<$B> And uh for the lazy ones you can even make the tables uh easy to rotate so that instead of one moving round you can just rotate it so that if the title that you want to look at is on that side then just rotate it slowly and uh to face you and be able to pick it and read it \n<$?> And it's even fascinating to note how even in such a rotating table someone can just stick there for almost ten minutes trying to rotate <O_><O/> And for good other good arrangements you can make them in sort of a conical shape The big books first uh The small books first that is a sort of a house-triangle that is you are having uh that uh a conical-shaped table It is rotating at a pivot Then you have racks here for your books so you can use a smaller book here there Then there is a big book taller book that doesn't fit here that one goes for the other rack Similarly you can just arrange in such levels You see the title is there The other book's title is there so everybody can see And then there are sort of adjustments for the size of the book It can be adjusted <O_><O/> You can read the book properly That is you have the The arrangement is just nice and attractive to customers Then it can be rotated from here to here to get a better glimpse of whatever you want to buy Shelfing and general stock You can ensure easy customer selection and self-service that is the best reach for your shelves should be having a ground clearance of uh two-and-a-half feet from the ground and five-and-a-half feet high so that uh this ensures uh self-service uh amongst your customers and easy reach and selection Shelf stock should be rationally arranged see There are fiction books you can arrange them alphabetically by author For the other general books you can arrange them by subject And another thing Usually stock rooms are neglected Yes you have your bookshop You have your operation area and the display But then you have your stock room In many cases these ones are neglected But according to me or rather in my view from the research I have done the stock rooms should not be neglected Books should also be kept logically there Maybe in subject and publisher order And let the type of order you choose for your operation zone that is your main area of the bookshop Let it match what is in the stock so that a book which is which a customer asks for can easily be located inside the stock To conclude I'd say that the sole purpose for a display is to enable you to sell your goods to customers as quickly and efficiently as possible It's there solely to tempt the would-be purchasers All in all what really matters is the approach to display Unless anybody has questions \n<$B> Yeah I would want us to visit the window where you have titles displayed I want us maybe to go and brainstorming on uh How should it exactly look like What could we include so that we really want to arrest this person who is passing by What things should we include uh together with books that we want to display What do we regard as crowd-pullers Something like what we said the card shops But what else could we include in the window \n<$?> power should have neon lights uh in order to attract the customers \n<$?> Yeah though for neon lights I think you have to be a bit careful with them because some tend to obscure the real mission of your work <$?> And to add on that it's very important in fact it's a another point by itself for the prices price tags of your books on the displays I think they should be very much attractive and readable from aRRR from afar so that they really entice the customer so that the customer will not be uncertain of what to meet inside there Not to meet wonders He just go surely knowing that this book is twenty shillings And he finds that it's twenty shillings not going there to expect something else\n<$?> Won't you discourage them from coming into the shop Many of the shops I've seen don't tell their customers this book is five hundred shillings they won't enter the shop \n<$?> But I think uh As for that one I think it's very much and subjective because for the customer to feel whether this book is just too expensive I tend to think that one will be an in-pass-by <O_><O/> Because for somebody uh Let's say somebody does medicine He surely knows that medicine books are very expensive So the price will not do any harm to him\n<$?> I think the uh including the price in the display is a very good idea because not so uh okay You may not have the money when you are going to buy a book You might have a book in mind But in the process of looking at the display you find a different book So you are not planned for that But if you know the price and maybe you have a chance you know to scan uh and read maybe the blurb and think the book is good you know whether to bargain for it or not So I think the price is important and then again maybe when you're buying a book you're not only buying it from one uh maybe bookshop There are so many bookshops in town Uh You can compare prices It uh helps you a lot instead of going to maybe shy off if it's not included you might shy off uh to ask to the counter because you are not are notRRR even intending to buy it you don't have the money so you you're even afraid Oh if I ask uh maybe these guys will tell me Oh how much do you have And you can bargain and strike a deal or something So I think uh including the price is okay \n<$?> It's even more convenient for you to see for yourself the price rather than go disturb those people You see to you how much it would be more like disturbing them And they are very much uh I mean most of them they are very arrogant Although that's the wrong attitude\n<$?> Okay there is two aspects which pricing can discourage For example uh most books went by <O_><O/> Then you know people get influenced by what they see first isn't it Say like I see and the first book I see is seven hundred and twenty-eight shilling because this bookshop is very expensive That might affect me for a very long time Then what I suggest is we should not do away the prices but should not be so much highlighted You know like all that we see is price not the books You just see the books there but you have prices and you have got good ones but not so much highlighted so that if I want to know the price on the books as he says I move forward and check the price But not that I'm far away and seeing seven hundred eight hundred as first impression\n<$?> So which one is more weighty putting the \n<$?> The book should be displayed there so that people passing by are attracted by the goodness of the book not the price of the book in most cases The book should attract me not the price", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b77cf813-957c-4ece-be62-2116693b96d8', 'added':

{'text': "<$C> I was just noting something here that uh we have said actually politics is very important in language planning And uh we cited the case of Tanzania that uh <ea/>Mwalimu Julius Nyerere actually spearheaded the popularisation of Kiswahili And uh from what we've said about Kenya uh even up to now the important leaders the powerful leaders in the country have all along been propagating for the use of Kiswahili more than English and uh as the case is they have not succeeded so much So can we maybe look at uh can we maybe cite other factors other than politics that have uh popularised English Because if it was just solely politics that is concerned with language planning then I don't see the reason why Kiswahili has not uh been so much popularised as English in I mean in Kenya Could there be other factors other than uh politics \n<$A> What do you think\n<$C> I don't know \n<$D> I think we talked about uh ideology I think that is still going back to politics But I think uh in Kenya we maybe look at uh the functions that uh English plays as the official language I think the functions are more and if we look at uh the functions not all of them can be said to be political Like if we say English is the language of the labour system in Kenya I don't know whether that is political or how we say that English is the one that is being used in the educational system though it is still the the government that implements this \n<$C> So what we are saying is that I want to although this could be outside of what we are saying but uh what the politicians are trying to do like Kenyatta what he was doing was actually cosmetic maybe to get the support of the people But in the real sense if he really wanted to implement the use of Kiswahili as a national language he could have succeeded Because he was just maybe going to parliament only when there are so many other arms of the government so many other spheres in the society that could maybe promote Kiswahili for example in education Even up to recently like in our education system we didn't Kiswahili was not examined at what primary school And yet the same politicians actually were uh trying to show the people that they were really for the African language that was Kiswahili So I look at it as cosmetic They were really get trying to get the support of the people but they were not serious enough to promote Kiswahili as a national language \n<$D> I mean that comes down to the same thing but uh we have got the elitist trying to exercise power over the majority That is actually what it waters down to Because if you look at it I'm trying to look at it from the point of view of the few Kenyans who have been educated at independence and the others that went out after independence those the organised what do you call the flights\n<$?> <O/> the air-lifts \n<$D> the air-lifts to the US Most of uh uh those personalities went out they came back and uh very few if any were propagating the aspect of us using Kiswahili or indigenous languages apart from the time as you said that they when they wanted to go in to ask for the votes from uh their constituency So uh ideally uh in Kenya the use or rather language planning or planning as a process has been used uh to exercise a kind of control uh especially in the past where we were not exposed to information and that is exactly what is happening right now that uh you find that uh the mass media particularly the radio is still governed and controlled by the government and uh this has not enabled us in fact that might be one of the reason why Kiswahili has not spread out as much because some people are very good in speech that if you gave him time to speak in Kiswahili uh give him air time in Kiswahili he'll talk so much and so well that at the end of the day he might end up discrediting the same uh uh arm that gave him the uh allowance for the air waves So I think there has been this control there has been this exercising of power by the elite over the majority There is uh a status quo that is trying to be maintained by using uh uh language-planning processes Uh So as much as we are advocating uh that we want everybody to become educated we want everybody to become literate I think in Kenya as you put it it's really cosmetic And uh apart from the fact that uh English has several other roles to perform I think we can also pick up like Tanzania we are not any less uh than what Tanzanians are We can also pick up but I think that idea of trying to maintain that uh difference in terms of uh economic uh classes and maybe political groupings and then we have to bring in the aspect of language planning \n<$B> I think we can look at Kenyatta as a man who was uh in two linguistic camps maybe for his own political gains First of all here on the other hand on one hand he was uh promoting the use of Kiswahili through decrees but he never got down to see the implementation of this in the wider political constituency And on the other hand he oversaw the use of English as the official language in maybe the official circles the parliament up to nineteen seventy-four and the education system So if we look at him he was trying to maintain his political ideology that is of capitalism because he the government had to use English in order to identify with the West And when it comes now to the masses themselves when it comes to the vote he had to go back to the masses everybody had to go back to the masses\n<$A> was the adoption of English merely to identify with the West \n<$B> It's also had a I think long colonial history in Kenya\n<$A> What was that\n<$B> It had been used by the British colonial powers \n<$C> And it was actually that it had been socialised into the Kenyans especially those ones at that time of independence they believed that anybody who  spoke English was more competent in terms uh it gave them as we said status prestige power and so on and so forth it was associated with that So that the young Kenyans at independence the elite took up this wholesale and uh did not try to see the rational behind it and therefore they also uh propagated the same ideas They also wanted to feel still up there and the majority down there so such that they also looked at almost the same level at uh as uh that we were viewing the colonial masters So the elite uh aspect really is like uh as he put it a colonial legacy that has spilled over to the language and the emotions\n<$A> How do you link that with uh with Fishman's assertion in one of the quotations there that uh one language policy was being uh advocated to enhance economic and political development Can you link those two\n<$C> I didn't quite get you \n<$A> What did you say about Fishman and technological economical and technological development \n<$B> Maybe I can before he says something I could say something about it that uh actually after independence the major issue was uh to see that Kenya was developing to catch up with the rest of the world And in I mean to do this it was not supposed to be isolated but it had to depend on the theRRR West which was developed to also uh catch up on development \n<$A> Not necessarily the West That is one thing that you shouldn't be saying because it comes out so naturally that the West but that is really not the point It isn't just the West \n<$B> Okay\n<$A> But anyway go on go on \n<$B> Yeah The point I'm trying to make here is that uh because of the need for economic development Kenya actually saw the need to use a language that is that had an international perspective \n<$A> Yeah that is the thing yeah\n<$B> and English actually came in handy \n<$A> That is the thing So the emphasis in the Kenyan uh political circles was first economic development That was primary in Tanzania it wasn't that that's where the difference in ideology comes in In Tanzania the primary purpose of the political the ruling political party was to develop the villages in Tanzania egalitarianism you all know what egalitarianism means We all share the little that we have We all have access to it And then spread political power to as many people as possible And how fast how can you use the language to do that Use the language that most of the people already understand So when you're talking about economic development economic development of the villages it is not economic development emphasising export trade Because in Kenya we're talking about export import trade Huge volumes you can look at the statistics very huge So you see our gross national product is huger than Tanzanian's But when you look at what actually trickles down to the villages in Kenya it's negligible Whereas in Tanzania you find everybody is getting their little bit So it now it's a question of ideology Which language will help Tanzanians achieve their political goals so they opted for Kiswahili the language of the masses because it is the masses that they were focusing on In Kenya it was capitalism which actually concentrates power on the hands of a few And those few are the few that actually knew English already And that's why the question asks uh uh talking about language planning  elitism and control political control How is language planning facilitating control political control of the few over the many That is what the person was asking and that is why what I wanted to see from your paper and I wasn't quite seeing it It is not necessarily true that that happened in Kenya but that is just one way of looking at it The socialists like <name/> uh Phillipson that you have also read will give it that slant but that is not necessarily the case You can defend Kenya too if you like It doesn't have to be seen in that light So do we see the difference between Kenya and Tanzania I mean that is not all you can say You can talk about it over and over again there are so many ways of looking at it But that's just one way of looking at it You saw what Mazrui and Mazrui are saying in that book rather sketchy but they also give you some interesting things to think about How about the question Leitham is proposing there that the language gain \n<$B> The equation that I was given \n<$A> You don't have to do talk about it in detail but does it make sense to you \n<$B> I only got the book this morning It wasn't there yesterday so\n<$A> Oh I uh can you go and look at it again\n<$B> The equation here says three plus and minus one \n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> I found it a bit interesting I just started looking at it \n<$A> Well the language gain that he's discussing there is interesting and it should explain what you were saying about Kenyatta's pronouncements that we should use our mother tongue <O_><O/> our Kiswahili because it is an indigenous language But at the same time we retain English The reason why what uh politicians say come to naught is that legally English is enjoying a status that is superior to that of Kiswahili So it doesn't matter what the",

{'text': "<>$2> By higher goals of uh I just <I fell short of mentioning what higher goals because it will look so dogmatic but I'm saying even higher goals of such things like religion Such that people who should seek even peace with their creator as a goal to look up for Maybe and since most religion for this matter do not advocate the taking of drugs we in other words say that those who are who look for that those kind of goals they are not going to end up being to taking drugs Apart from the kind of distorted humanism we have the one of uh associated with uh reggae music and uh bang taking Apart from that kind of disoriented humanism most religions are against drug use And I'm talking of such things and also even a goal of being a responsible family person is a higher goal than just driving a car After you've driven the car you have died we have buried you What next But at least if you are responsible family person your efforts will be benefiting more than one person Those are the kind of goals that we are saying And if you are uh going on well in academics hope to do well and uh go on and on and not say Oh I'm now a graduate I can drink and eat as though the world has ended Just the way you say you wait the day you'll be finishing here You walk and people say my life is now full After two days they have discovered that's not the end of it Leaving campus is not the end of life So they should be encouraged to seek higher goals that's what I meant So let's discuss homosexuality By the way what do you people think is homosexuality Now that you are so quiet Anyone out there That's why I did not continue the other discussion <$?> Uh Two Homosexuality is the indulgence in sexual affairs by two people of two males \n<$B> Okay Yeah That is what is uh called homosexuality <O/> homosexuality is the opposite of heterosexuality And heterosexuality is sex between a male and a female But now homosexuality is sex Even at this time we still have problems whether it is sex even But it is It is that uh association that is almost close to sex between men between two males And uh do you think that homosexuality should be allowed or not allowed And if not why Before we see how they argue <O/> remembering that we said that people have things that are called natural rights and individual rights that should not be interfered with \n<$?> Actually we are finding ourselves in a fast-changing world a fast-changing society And uh you know things which were formerly uh inadmissible which were not uh admitted you know in society are nowadays being admitted Such things as uh homosexuality such things as you know abortion According to me homosexuality should not be allowed in society\n<$B> Why\n<$?> Because uh for one it uh actually contravenes or goes against the natural laws that govern us It is very unnatural for one male to uh to go with another male you know It's very unnatural you know They were not made for such You see that is why I feel that homosexuality should not be allowed But we are finding ourselves in a society where even the homosexuals have uh their rights on what they want and what they don't want They are nowadays even allowing one male to marry another male you know to have weddings Uh Such that actually homosexuality's just a very small aspect of the whole problem \n<$B> Then what is uh That's a man talking about homosexuality But we are joining both homosexuality and lesbianism because the arguments that go along with it are the same You people think that uh lesbianism should be allowed Do you understand what it is Do you people understand what lesbianism is It's the opposite of uh homosexuality Now this is the relationship between two women They are the only ones who know how they do it But do you think it should be encouraged Because one of the arguments is that men misused women Because women feel uh men feel that uh women cannot satisfy their uh uh natural sex urge without males Therefore they feel that that is one of the things that men use to dominate or domineer women Based on the great movement that we have today in the world of uh gender freedom or gender equality should lesbianism be encouraged as a form of women liberation of I want the ladies to talk first Yeah <name/> What do you say\n<$?> Uh I think I will identify with <name/> I don't think it is right for the society to allow lesbianism to continue because it's it is against the natural rules\n<$B> Who lays down both of you are very natural Who lays down natural rules Or is it maybe what we get used to is what we think is natural but that not that may not necessarily be the case People can also get used to what is unnatural in our opinion\n<$?> Now there is what you call uh normalising the abnormal That's exactly what's really taking root in our society Now if a Bible is any authority to go by then I suppose that after God had created Adam he later did make uh Eve and then told them to populate Now remember this was not be told to Adam alone Now this is not to say that we are going to take it because the authority of the Bible is still questionable Now but if we are to go by that then we realise that in this situation therefore a sexual relationship is therefore to involve two opposite sexes Even the animals which are being uh saved by Noah's ark they were just taken in two by two of two different sexes not two animals of the same sex Now uh as much as women are saying that uh they are being misused is understandable But who says that two wrongs make a right Because seemingly as they are encouraging lesbianism they are only arguing that men are misusing them We cannot solve a problem by running away from uh from it Let women themselves try to at least uh handle men uh make them docile that is And then there is another thing which is really encouraging this uh lesbianism that is Now I was reading another article which was saying that in New York itself it's got one million plus women over men Mark you there in this situation assuming that every man is to marry But we got the Jews who are somehow uh thinking that they are selected and they should not be <O/> Now we've got uh those who are really into the church and they don't want to marry We've got some men whom in themselves are very got very queer kind of character It is actually the homosexuals we are talking about here They also don't want to marry So in this situation that men or women also find themselves in a very kind of fixed situations and some circumstances\n<$B> So in that case you justify their action because they have no choice Now that men have opted not to come to them \n<$?> Remember I said that two wrongs never make a right \n<$B> So\n<$?> So that therefore means that as much as women are trying to I mean to at least appeal for lesbianism as another way of uh uh satisfying their sexual urge it's not the best alternative There are so many other alternatives like encouraging for uh what you call it where a man is encouraged to marry more than three or four wives \n<$B> polygamous\n<$?> <O/>\n<$B> Uh polygamy I think let's do this Arguments for homosexuality They fall into the general the general category of social and moral reasons Arguments for homosexuality that's the arguments that homosexuality some homosexuals offer They fall into the general category of social and moral reasons One of the arguments is that there should be no sexual constraints among consenting adults There should be no sexual constraints among consenting adults What this one means is that uh when somebody like They are not the people we discussed with the power of the law of contract The law of contract mean demands that when you sign a contract with somebody you must be of sound mind and you should be also of reasonable age where you can be referred to as an adult And based on that which is a right cause when you sign a contract with somebody you have now a right to the services that that person has contracted you to benefit from him And now basing on that one this is what now the this is where they get the argument that when two adults consent to have sex with one another there should be nobody to interfere with them After all it's their own body What are the social effects of homosexuality It's only the two and they have consented So what is the society alarmed about It should let them continue That is their freedom As long as they have agreed among themselves then there should be no problem This is what to say While admitting that forced sex and sexual abuse of children are wrong That is what they argue While admitting that forced sex and sexual abuse of children are wrong many sexual many homosexuals contend that it is a violation of their freedom many homosexuals contend that it's a violation of their freedom to prohibit any free sexual expressions to prohibit any free sexual expressions What two persons do sexually and freely is their own moral business \n<$?> Question sir\n<$B> Yes\n<$?> You see uh with this argument therefore \n<$B> Yes\n<$?> Where does it place bestiality then\n<$B> Placing what \n<$?> Bestiality That is uh having uh you know sex with uh an animal \n<$B> Uh This is argument for homosexual can be based on this also you will now root out the issue over the animal because the animal did not consent because the animal cannot reason \n<$?> It didn't sign a contract\n<$B> and it is not under any contract It did not sign But they are saying that uh what will happen with two between two people who have consented it's their moral business you should not uh interfere What do you think about it \n<$?> Because this is a situation whereby like in Europe you know in the West <O_><O/> you know a woman can decide she has a pet dog Uh But you know she's keeping this uh pet dog for sexual purposes you know Even in Kenya here we find a situation whereby some communities after a certain football uh match where uh they have overwhelming victory you know they get an animal and they have sex with the animal you know Even in the West modern technology actually has come up with uh you know artificial vaginas uh vibrators you know It's all the same thing\n<$B> Oh I thought you <O_><O/> or you are raising a story But there are people when they win football matches in Kenya they'll they go raping animals \n<$?> Yeah Animals They even buy you know just a loaf of bread for sexual purposes such things \n<$?> That's not on community basis That's just an abuse of humanity No community can make that part of its day to day goings \n<$B> Have you heard of it like Have you heard of that what he said\n<$?> Uh well I was born and brought up with him in almost the same area But it's news for me \n<$?> I heard about it \n<$B> Uh So at least he has a witness \n<$?> Yeah and I know what he's saying is a bit true Not a bit It's true and I think it can be such that \n<$B> That's chaotic I think that one now is absurd If even bread is going to be a moral issue as it comes to sexual behaviour So we are saying in other words that is one of their arguments that their freedom as long as uh two people have consented then they should not be interfered with Secondly the right to privacy protects uh homosexuality The right to privacy protects homosexuality They argue that women constitutionally have a right of privacy over their over their own bodies", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'df43078f-8dbb-4dde-bb2a-3235e6e5a8fb', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:00.987657+00:00',

{'text': "<$?> And then uh I want to ask another question Uh Yes You Uh How long should the display remain For example how much should you change your displays and what should be the time period and reason of changing the displays\n<$?> The change of the display by the currency of the book and the way the books are selling the rate of selling that is. For the book which is selling relatively fast I think most people know that what book that is and it's good qualities But for a book which is going slowly that is selling slowly rather should be displayed at least to create that impression <O_><O/> there's a book there \n<$?> I have another question Uh now because I'm a uh a regular buyer of books it will reach a point where I might not even be interested in the display How do you maintain that I be interested in the display How do you suggest that we arrange uh the new arrivals and the old uh the old uh titles which are still in the display How do you suggest Is there a pattern that you can maybe divide the display section that new arrivals and the old titles \n<$?> That's a very good suggestion For us to have divided displays sort of just demarcate like uh sections within the window displays You put new arrivals <O_><O/> such things So that when somebody sees these are new arrivals you just come and rush in to see what is there that is so new Then he just go inside to see the new arrivals I think that one will be good to maintain your customers because as far as business is concerned you need to maintain your old customers and to attract new customers \n<$?> Okay I was wondering in case a bookshop manager There are some occasions whereby you find that uh uh a book is on display but as soon as you go inside inquiring you are told that the book is out of stock Then I was wondering whether it's good As soon as the book has come out of uh the stock maybe due to limits in supply should we remove the book from the display Because it might make us lose credibility among the customers\n<$?> I think that one is rather subjective but it's advisable still to put it on the display but \n<$B> I don't think it's advisable to retain it on the display if the title has run out of stock because uh it may even affect the good-will that customers have towards your bookshop because customers want to get what they can see What about this aspect of uh music Where do you think we can apply music It is a shop inside a shop \n<$B> But do you think that you can have a very small speaker maybe some piped music from uh inside the shop You could have a speaker next to the window display with some recording maybe instead of having the new arrival uh new arrivals written on a poster or something like that you could have a recording that tells people These are the new books that we've uh acquired \n<$?> I think on music I think it should still be inside and outside the shop Outside that the piped music on the window display will be enticing the viewer. The kind that is telling people Hey in our bookshop there are only competitive prices Why don't you step in There are new arrivals Then when they get inside there is cool relaxed music so that they are not in a hurry to choose\n<$?> I think also music uh despite uh having it in the bookshop should also come in the display Because uh imagine a situation where I am just walking I'm in a hurry I might not have the time to look at the display the new arrivals and all that Then something obstructs me Some music playing next to the wall And then I look Oh I find that very beautiful and attractive display Then I I'll be forced maybe to stop for a minute or two and which can lead even to twenty minutes or something and I can even end up buying I think that music should also fit uh to the display although not so loud but at least \n<$?> And especially in big towns and more so is Eldoret whereby most people who live around here they are farmers Did you take into consideration what you are going to put in the display the kind of display so that you can attract many different groups of a town\n<$?> Yes I think that one is very subjective and depends on the town in question You see for every town the people of that locality has a certain have a certain characteristic that is And for the type of business you are in that is the bookshop business you know your customers well because before you established your bookshop you had a market research to ascertain the viability of the what you are going to do the business you are going to do And you know the readers who are to be coming to your shop So it serves to explain that for every area there are customer characteristics and there are things which are unique features which are unique to that particular type of customers Maybe if it's a highly agricultural area you know they might be very much looking for agricultural goods That one you might have considered before opening your bookshop And that one can be reflected in the *biasness> of your stock You can be highly biased on the agricultural information if most of your customers are farmers I think that one can be taken care of that way If it's an urban area you have all sorts of styles so you can display the great greatest variety of of books possible \n<$?> Uh I want to revisit this issue whereby you say that for If it's possible whoever is looking at the display should see through the shop Uh There are cases where that one might not really be uh positive It might have a negative impact on the people who are seen For example okay uh as a buyer and ordinary buyers for that matter you one indicator that the shop is good or maybe the books are good is to see uh maybe there are so many people in the shop But now for example if I see through the display and there's nobody in the shop apart from one uh somebody only seated there at the uh uh cashier there So you can you can imagine although the prices might be good but I wonder Are these uh do people buy things from this shop or not I can have that hesitance So I think uh to an extent also that should be relative Uh It depends If the buyers are If it's an enlightened town society where people value books then that one is okay But for our case and in most uh places or maybe wherever I've been working I find it is still applicable to block the display from seeing the shop \n<$?> And I think for that one we use The problem can be traced back to the <O/> of a book-buying culture It's almost universal because for most cases you find that there are peak seasons and very low seasons such that even in the most competitive bookshops you can enter and find almost nobody only the attendants there But in the peak season maybe people are uh schools are re-opening you find all the bookshops are stacked even if they don't have see-through window displays is it That one is relative to time\n<$?> Take for example here in the library You are not sure whether it's open or not And you come here and you see they have opened the door Then you see So you are not seeing the door opened You are not seeing anybody They could be operating but you are likely just to go ahead and pass And if the door was open though there was nobody inside you know they are operating What I'm trying to say is blocking exactly throughout <O_><O/> are not seeing anything can be a problem also because you don't know whether people are inside there or not and you don't want to be the first one to get in You know that kind of thing But if it's open at least you see the cashier already Maybe one person You may want may wantRRR to get in Or you may see many people which will be much better for you because so many people are getting in So I think you should also show that \n<$?> I think it can even serve as a control where the idling attendants the seemingly idling attendants inside there can beckon customers Because they can see them \n<$?> one thing can attract this one and the other attracts the other one So that e.g. that person who is passing and does not and sees there is nobody inside It's like even if that person saw a crowd inside So it's like whatever you do you may not actually end up attracting anybody but at least you may attract one person if it's only yourself\n<$?> Uh now since there are so many display styles and all that do you suggest that you maintain one routine display or you keep on changing display formats and styles \n<$?> It's good to have various display styles and keep on changing so that any every time a customer comes he may find something different Even if he's used to that place he finds Oh it's quite changed So he wants to have a new taste on things That way he comes inside\n<$B> And even the position It's actually advisory to change positions of the books so that if you put this book at the right-hand corner this uh for the for two days Next time you remove it from there take it to the centre or maybe to the left-hand corner In that way people not even come to think uh of your bookshop as though it's holding only in stock books that are not being bought \n<$?> I have something to say against displays outside First of all books deteriorate when exposed to strong sunlight You know the quality of paper is rather poor Secondly that can encourage shoplifting and other extra expenses for somebody security men to be keeping watch over your items And they'll still be accumulating dust so somebody has to be there dusting all the times and in fact he'll be obscuring the would-be purchasers when he is dusting So it's advisable to have them inside And then there's the window display\n<$B> Well but what do you think about that Don't you think having them outside could even make the would-be customers feel free to look at the books maybe get hold of them feel them read the back uh look at the pages If you have enough security and if you make the surrounding well taken care of for example if you have a cemented area where you don't have a lot of dust and if you have shades whereby you wouldn't have direct sunlight uh and uh affecting the books don't you think that could also be a good idea \n<$?> I think that one can work well in peak season when there's so much activity Or when the peak season is just coming to an end and then you want to maximise sales. That way you can have a sort of exhibition just outside in the veranda of the shop so that everybody now can see come have a glance and then see there are multitudes of people inside then walk right inside and jostle for a place to just have a glimpse of what is in stock \n<$?> I feel books need to be taken care of One when you place books outside there there's a lot of dust And you got to protect them from dust Secondly sunlight wind and all that can be very bad for the books and also the temperatures And also when people are really browsing through them it's likely to tear and wear of the book The mutilation of the book can also take place outside there So I think the display should be within the bookshop at least not outside \n<$?> Okay <O_><O/> maybe one copy of each title And the process maybe by doing that is only three-fifty copies So maybe you can always sacrifice one that one copy maybe if this is a way to make higher profit\n<$B> But what is the trend in the book trade I think in a society like Kenya's where we know people are even afraid of getting into bookshops you want to take the book as close as possible to the people So you find that books are even being sold in churches so that after the mass or after the service you could have a very small uh staff just display your books outside the door so that uh as people come out of the church they can have a look at the books and maybe have a feeling of buying the books and the bookseller makes a sale uh instantly So actually the trend is taking the books to as informal places as possible to where you don't even expect to have a book because we want to convince people that books are part and parcel of their live They really need them They can't avoid them For their well-being they need to be entertained They need to be educated So each and every category of books is being taken to the final consumers", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'ccf0e8f2-24a7-4c84-a57a-9a4dbfcc19b1', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:00.988622+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9806689620018005, 'non_english_score': 0.019331037998199463}
{'text': "<$A> Welcome to Breastfeeding Corner In today's edition of the programme we are going to discuss the support that the breastfeeding mothers expect from the community Welcome Breast milk is the ideal food for the baby Its composition meets all the baby's nutritional needs and helps to protect him or her against many of the infections common in infancy No other food can do this For the mother to breastfeed successively she should be given moral support by all those close to her This includes the relatives neighbours and friends Mrs Betty Mturi from the Breastfeeding Information Group.\n<$B> She needs somebody to help her to support her to tell her how nice she is to have had this baby The husband should be able to come a bit earlier from work if he can to come and give this mother a little bit of support Maybe sometimes she needs something from kiosk she needs milk she needs maybe food and she has been all alone whole day when the husband was away at work I emphasise here in Nairobi where we stay in the city uh mother-in-law is at home your sisters are at home in <O/> Maybe the husband's  sisters are also in <O/> and it happens that it's only the mother and the father who are living in Nairobi And it becomes a bit difficult when the mother has just delivered and she's alone in the house She feels she's left alone to cope with everything and  sometimes it becomes too difficult for the mother She's overloaded She has a baby to breastfeed a baby who is crying all the time and the baby who is supposed to be demand-fed as we said earlier The baby should be fed as the baby cries When the baby needs the mother the milk is already ready in the breast the baby should be just put there to breastfeed And for this reason that the baby is demand-fed the mother is quite busy She will have no time to go in the kiosk to buy some milk or to buy some food As you know in Nairobi you have to buy everything She has nobody to leave the baby She can't move around so sometimes she becomes a little bit upset We should be with our mothers after delivery to support them to be with her let her know that she has done good job to have delivered this baby Fathers sometimes feel a little bit of jealousy when the mother is just looking after the baby She the father  wants a lot of attention and the father thinks now the attention has been now drawn from him to the baby fully and I want to emphasise to fathers that this baby it's you It's your baby so it's you When the mother is loving this baby the mother is loving you as well It's your baby so you should not feel that the mother is only attending to the baby and she has forgotten uh to attend to you What you should do is to support her try to be with her try to show her that what she's doing is very noble Let her breastfeed this baby Buy her things if you are you've found she's in the house with nothing You go for shopping Bring her what she needs and be with near her Hold this baby for her for a while you know Smile to the baby Talk to the baby They always say A new-born baby is a human being If he hears a voice of a person she or he will never forget that voice throughout his life and that's how kids know their father by the voice and their mother by the voice the way they speak If you don't speak to this baby there is no way this baby will know who you are The baby will learn to know the father through the father talking to the baby And it's always very good I want also to emphasise to our dear fathers that the mother needs to be really comfortable If this mother is a little bit upset the as I said the milk will just dry up You know mothers people have forgotten mothers are also they're mammals they're like a cow If you use that milking a cow and you come with a stick you slap the cow from the back the cow will not produce any milk It's exactly the same with mothers If the father comes so much annoyed start quarrelling the mother  starts making her upset the milk will just disappear It will dry up She'll have no milk And this is the trend we have had with many people who have not known the management of breastfeeding that the father comes or somebody else comes and starts upsetting this mother Maybe she's had a baby girl and somebody wanted a baby boy You know a baby is a baby and somebody comes and  starts comment that uh you had another you had another girl oh it's a baby girl you know the mother becomes upset and immediately the mother is disturbed the milk just disappears So we beg you friends father anybody who is a friend to this mother immediately she has a baby please support her try to be friendly to her You can see some mothers after delivery they become easily upset You have seen mothers who start crying and they cry a lot they cry You don't know why they are crying Because the hormones after delivery  become a little bit disturbed and she needs this support When you see her crying don't think that uh now what's wrong with her she has become a nut No This is just normal It's completely normal Let her cry off and then she'll be happy that you just pass over It is just for a period then it should disappear What she needs is support from her husband A husband who dearly  loves her is the only one who will have few words of loving to make her feel she's comfortable and she is cheered up \n<$A> So fathers you have heard all from Mrs Mturi The breastfeeding mother needs your support She needs your soothing words to breastfeed successfully Give her ideal food and encourage her to eat and take enough drinks.\n<$B> The mother should drink porridge We have millet We have uh sorghum We have our own local food which is very good in producing uh milk If she drinks a lot of uh porridge uh which is made from uh millet <ea/>ujii they have said any mother who drinks <ea/>ujii of <O/> produce more milk It has something which increases the mother's uh lactation and the milk-production becomes more When this mother goes back maybe she's want to go somewhere uh to visit maybe to visit and she has to leave the baby let the mother know who to express this milk leave uh milk in the cup and somebody else you know help her to feed the baby by cup Because a mother has when they go back from their maternity leave you find out the first week the second week the milk  starts drying up because they are not expressing as you a mother express the milk the more milk is made so you the mother should know how to express empty the breast so that lactation can continue even when she's away Breastfeed this baby What we say the mother should breastfeed the baby at least for two years Now that we know we can't manage to we are now in family-planning We need to have few kids not the way people used to have We have the number of children you want you discuss with your husband This baby because you are not now intending to have more uh kids we have at least a few number of kids you are supposed to breastfeed this baby as much as you can Maybe you can go on for three years according to how you feel The more you breastfeed your child the more healthy a child you get and the more clever child you get Breast milk has got a component which helps to make uh a baby's uh brain grow properly to a human brain and make them even genius they have done research Breast milk is not only breast - it's only for food it's not only food alone it has a lot It's food and it has so many nutrients it has antibodies it has so many components So when the mother gives this breast milk to the baby she should know that she's doing a noble job to make a human being proper a human being who will live as a human being That's why you see the mothers who don't have enough support the milk dries up very fast And then they start using other feed buying this uh milk from tinned milk And this formula as we know they are not supposed to be given to babies because it's not healthy to give them to children We should breastfeed because we don't know where this milk were you know made what it was made up of They have so many uh they have so many extras uh components which we don't understand give children a lot of skin diseases chest or chest diseases coughs and really we have seen that we made a mistake and we don't want to use these formulas anymore We rather use mother because mother is here and she has got easy food straight from mother to the baby and nice food is food and is all prepared by God What we should now do is to really know that breast milk is the best and we should do and encourage every mother after delivery to breastfeed the baby and feed the babies for at least two years if you can't imagine more But if you can continue the better for your child\n<$A> Mrs Betty Mturi from the Breastfeeding Information

{'text': "<$A> When Wanajukwa Players made their debut in July with Abraham Hussein's play Mashetani at the French Cultural Centre I thought they had a long way to go and said as much The group displayed lack of finesse in the use of techniques such as mime and had plotted the movement rather poorly Three months later Wanajukwa have been on stage again this time with <O/> a translation of Wole Soyinka's The Trials of Brother Jero This play staged by Wanajukwa at the Kenya National Theatre last week where the group was officially launched is a satire on a Christian preacher Brother Jero Jero is the epitome of hypocrisy and symbolises all that is unchristian His greatest weakness is that every time he sees a woman he's simply overwhelmed It is not out of the way to imagine that he actually engages in some sexual activities that are against Christian ethics But Jero is also a *debter> who is not too keen on repaying what he owes others In fact in the play the wife of one of his flock Chume comes outside his house so that he can repay her In one of the most comical scenes we see Jero dashing out of a window to escape this woman All this time Chume has been asking Jero to let him beat up the wife But Jero has been dissuading him citing their Christianity as the reason but when the woman insists so much on camping at Jero's the preacher willingly tells Chume to give her a thorough beating Chume does this but eventually realises that Jero gives the permission to get even with the stubborn woman rather than to gratify his follower In fact Chume is the one who gives us the hint that Jero might have been up to some tricks even with his wife Chume therefore becomes a symbol of ignorance and later one of enlightenment He's the blind *congregant> who so staunchly believes in his pastor that he loses his own independence Here's a character to be sympathised with rather than condemned Wanajukwa's presentation of <O/> was quite entertaining with the actors and actresses showing clear trace of differentiation This differentiation was particularly pointed in crowd-scenes where the congregation sings and dances such typical trouble-scenes where we usually see people behave the same way as if they were uniform Wanajukwa made a clear effort to have each character come out in his or her own way The best example of this was that of William Ugonde doing the part of a member of the congregation <ea/>Mzee Mgusi Ogonda was noticeable for his *caricatural> dance which reminded us of the various prayer rallies we see in estates and streets Pharoah Ochichi also came out very well as Chume the loyal follower as did Tingo Nyamatiko as Jero Perhaps one character which should have been given more punch was that of Chume's wife played by Anne Karuiki who was a bit too mild in the trouble-scenes But the most serious problems with the production concerned positioning of artists on stage In positioning characters it is necessary to be aware of what effect is needed We talk of positioning for establishing focal points and for creating dominating positions thus a character who is meant to stand out can be made to do so by being positioned separately from the others or in such a position that he appears to be in control of the others It is clear that Wanajukwa did not give much thought to this and therefore ended up with some rather clumsy positions Closely related to this is the problem of masking Masking simply refers to the problem of actors and actresses standing in the way of other characters This is something that must be avoided as much as possible unless the character being masked is technically out of action or if the masking is part of the action directed Otherwise masking reveals a lack of awareness among artists and denies the audience the benefit of observing all that goes on Wanajukwa is a group that is dedicated to the promotion of the national language Kiswahili Talking during the launch the group's chairman T Nyamatiko said that the group had decided to do Swahili because that is what they are most comfortable with Secondly he said that they had been criticised for targeting the school-audience where there is ready market But he observed that there was nothing wrong with that approach because after all the group has to establish a financial base for its take-off But much as Tingo was right it would be most absurd for Wanajukwa to only do school-plays and not venture out That would make it more like the University of Nairobi Chakina Group which has notoriously done the same plays over and over This kind of thing happening does no good to the artist By choosing to concentrate on Swahili plays Wanajukwa is taking on a very daunting task because the theatre world will want to look up the group for the writing and development of scripts in Swahili It will be the group's duty to seek out playwrights writing in Swahili if no member of the group is himself a playwright But another way in which Wanajukwa would be useful is to engage in the translation of theatre masterpieces into Swahili for Kenyan audiences When this happens then the group will surely be giving an invaluable service \nEzekiel Olembi of Kenyata University tells Preview that plans for the National Young Playwrights' meeting are complete This meeting is to be held at Kenyatta University from October thirtieth to

issue of the programme Preview On the controls was Charles Muiruri I'm William Ogunda Goodnight \n\n<$A> Our environment \nIn this edition Shelter for sustainable development combating poverty and standards of living conditions while protecting the environment\nUNCHS United Nation's Centre for Human Settlement Habitat is the United Nation's focal point for facilitating human settlement solutions as an integral component of sustainable development processes not only for individual countries but also the world community In this challenge the centre is particularly conscious of the <O/> to bring more direct benefits to the millions of inadequately sheltered and homeless people throughout the world In Nairobi Kenya UNCHS Habitat was established in nineteen seventy-eight by the United Nations General Assembly two years after Habitat United Nations' Conference on Human Settlements held in Vancouver Canada UNCHS Habitat was instrumental in growing up the global strategy for shelter for the year two thousand to co-ordinate global efforts to facilitate the provision of adequate shelter for all by the end of the century This strategy was formally adopted by the General Assembly in nineteen eighty-eight and now provides the focus for the centre's work The term sustainable development brings together two basic principles underpinning the management of human activities one concentrating on development goals the other on limiting the harmful impacts of human activities on natural environment The first the development component is about meeting the needs of the present generation The second the sustainable component is about human activity not compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs The film for this year's World Habitat Day Shelter for Sustainable Development has been chosen to highlight the central role that Shelter Delivery in the context of human settlement can play in *salvating> our planet's life support system and in meeting the needs for all The United Nations' Centre for Human settlement Habitat believes that the way to reconcile economic and ecological imperatives is through alleviating poverty in human settlements The creation of adequate and appropriate shelter for all can generate economic opportunity for vast numbers of the poor It can improve environmental conditions in rural and urban areas and it can act as a vehicle to harnessing active commitment of all people everywhere to the tasks of preventing careless waste of non-renewable resources for a sustainable future\n<$A> How can we help to achieve shelter for sustainable development An environmentally friendly house should be situated in such a way that it uses the minimum amount of productive land and is constructed with materials that have no toxic effects and takes maximum advantage of the prevailing climate conditions for sunlight and ventilation thereby cutting down on the use of energy The household would energy-efficient appliances and be careful in their use of water If all this were done on the individual level the accumulative effect on the global environment would be tremendous Similarly our settlements will have to evolve in new environmentally conscious directions Recycling managing and disposing of waste materials in environmentally conscious ways that become a habit a social cultural attitude ingrained in our thinking.\n<$A> Every year UNCHS Habitat celebrates World Habitat Day every first Monday of October During this day governments and non-governmental organisations throughout the world mark the day with different activities The Secretary General of the United Nations Dr Butros Butros Ghali issued a statement for the commemoration of the day In his statement he said \n<$B> I quote <quote_><quote/> End of quote\n<$A> On this World Habitat Day the Secretary General says we should recommit ourselves to build a world devoid of homelessness poverty and destitution a world in which all can share in the earth's resources and all have access to basic necessities such as food and shelter Only thus he says shall we have laid the proper moral economic and social foundation for sustainable development in the spirit of one earth and one humanity", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '4ed31b3c-79a0-4df7-bf62-601ef6d1a750', 'added':

Nairobi uh Traffic Branch Nairobi Area He starts with last week's accident figures\n<$B> Thank you Wanjira Kago and the following is the last week's accident figures In Coast Province six people died Twenty-six were seriously injured and twenty-five were slightly injured There occurred a total of forty-three accidents in Coast Province In Central Province eight people died Thirty-three were seriously injured and thirty-four were slightly injured There occurred a total of thirty-three accidents in Central Province In Eastern Province one person died Eight were seriously injured and three were slightly injured There occurred a total of ten accidents in Eastern Province In Njanga Province four people died Six were seriously injured and another six were slightly injured There occurred a total of fifteen accidents in Njanga Province In Western Province two people died Twelve were were seriously injured and eight were slightly injured There occurred a total of fourteen accidents in Western Province In Rift Valley Province no one died but fifteen people were seriously injured and another six were slightly injured There occurred a total of twelve accidents in Rift Valley Province In Nairobi Province nine people died Twenty-two were seriously injured and eighty-three were slightly injured There occurred a a total of eighty-three accidents in Nairobi Province In North-Eastern Province there was no accident at all and we commend the residents of the Province for uh maintaining uh safety on their roads In total uh thirty people died uh in the Republic One hundred and twenty-two were seriously injured and another one hundred and sixty-five were slightly injured And the total number of the uh of the accidents in Kenya was two hundred and ten Compared with the previous week we see that there was a decrease of thirteen people uh also died They decreased by thirteen because the previous week we had forty-three Those who were seriously injured increased by eleven because we had a hundred and eleven the previous week And those who were seriously uh slightly injured decreased by four because we had one hundred and sixty-nine compared to this uh to the previous uh last week's one sixty-five The total number of accidents in the Republic also increased by fifteen because uh the previous uh the last week we had one hundred and ninety-five compared to last week's two hundred and ten\n<$A> Now the number of people who died has come down by thirteen and that's a good sign and it looks like operation Usalama is effective Remember it's still on and you're being watched So be extremely careful when using the road The Nairobi International Show is back with us Time for Chief Inspector David Kariuki who tells me he will be commanding traffic in the Nairobi International Show to educate us more on what to do during the Show Chief Inspector Kariuki\n<$B> Thank you uh I'll not actually be commanding the traffic but I'll be participating in the Show uh at Yamhuri Park and as you all know that all roads now lead to Yamhuri Park for the uh Nairobi International Show nineteen ninety-four uh the traffic policemen are going to be extremely very very busy uh all over the place particularly in Nairobi and I'm sure even other adjacent  provinces is like uh Eastern uh Rift Central where a lot of people will be coming to the Show uh the ShowRRR to the Nairobi Show we will be quite busy and we expect a lot of vehicles to come from uh from outside Nairobi and the Nairobi City is going to be full of vehicles Uh in fact it's also going to be full of human traffic uh and this calls for uh an exerted effort and we are prepared for this and we anticipate that uh the Show will go well as the previous years\n<$A> Now Chief Inspector Kariuki has just talked about up-country people who come to participate in the Show I'm just wondering how necessary it is for someone to drive with his own personal vehicle to come into Nairobi when we already have problems with the traffic Is it necessary\n<$B> Well uh it is necessary because not all people uh uh want to come to the Nairobi International Show in groups In fact we shall have groups coming to the Show We shall have individuals driving themselves into the Show or let's say into the City and this one is going to increase the number of vehicles that are usually in Nairobi and this is the time uh we actually ask people to be more uh to be extra careful uh not to cause accidents uh We also urge other road users like uh the Public Service vehicles like the <ea/>matatus buses and uh other road users uh not to commit these petty offences like uh obstruction uh and these other uh offences like uh blocking the road uh because when you do that you cause a lot of jam because vehicles will have increased and as you go to the Show you have to obey the directives of the police given by the police officers There're also signs placed on the roads leading to the showground and you have to obey There will be cars using stickers and policemen are all over uh to direct you uh If you are told please go and park to this parking place please obey because if you don't then you cause a jam uh As you all know you have seen Nairobi International Show has got I mean there're a lot of people vehicular I mean vehicular traffic and human traffic is quite big and if you start arguing with a policeman that I want to park here I want to drop this one uh inside when you don't have the necessary sticker then you cause a lot of  problems and in fact uh you may even cause an accident because when you cause a long queue of vehicles following each other uh because of arguing with a policeman uh then this is just too bad and you may find yourself ending up being taken to a police station your vehicle being towed away because we do not want uh these people who come there to argue uh they want to park where they want They don't want to follow directives This is too bad There are stickers as I said there earlier and if you want them buy the uh sticker for the parking that you want If you do not buy a sticker there're car uh public car parks where you go and pay and again we have the members' car park We have the trade car park We have uh uh uh free car park We have got uh uh parking places inside the showground that is uh D car park uh This is where people with the D uh stickers stickers marked D are going to park and they're directed by the traffic policemen and those with the uh members' car uh members' stickers will have to park at the members' car park and you have to be very very very careful because there is a lot of theft of motor vehicles If you park and you are given a receipt by the National Youth Service people make sure that you retain that receipt because if you lose you loseRRR that receipt when you come to take your vehicle you'll not be allowed to take the vehicle because you must produce that receipt that you got when you parked your vehicle Failure to do that it will force you to go home uh by other means to bring the log book and other necessary documents to prove that the car belongs to you\n<$A> Now transport is in high demand during the Show Now two things happened to the Public Service Vehicles First they overload then they overcharge How are you going to curb this problem\n<$B> Well as you know as you know Wanjira Kago when there is such a big thing uh such a big event uh going on in our country the traders uh tend to take or to hijack the members of the public and overcharge and also overload but uh we try to minimise this by placing our people uh on all routes but sometimes you may uh you may find that some of these things may go unnoticed because the policemen are far too much busy and we try to control traffic uh as much I mean uh uh as much as we can but then you find us that there is very little time left uh to check on these trivial offences or other traffic offences uh All we would like to ask the members of the public is try to avoid as much as possible do not to cause accidents Drive carefully uh and you be sure that you are on the right route where you want to go If you want to go to the showground particularly those people who come from the rural areas some of them do not know uh where to go or where to park please ask a policeman Ask any policeman who before you get to the showground so that you don't get confused when you get to the showground and then you start uh going round round and around and then perhaps you find that your fuel is running out and you may think that policemen are harassing you which is not the case They are just trying to uh be orderly or to park the vehicle in an orderly manner So please try and enquire before you get into the showground There are police There are policemen traffic policemen all the way through to the showground If you come from the Kabira side if you come from Gong side all the way through you'll find policemen uh uh all along the uh uh route and you may stop and enquire from a policeman Now I have this type of a sticker where do I go Which route do I follow Enquire before you come to the showground because at the showground you'll find the area is congested with vehicles and human traffic and then you uh if you start roaming wondering about uh what to do Then you cause problems to other people because we want here vehicles to run smoothly to their respective parking places\n<$A> Now there is also the issue of uh human traffic in the showground There are several people who work in groups and cause obstruction I would like you to give them a word of caution\n<$B> Yes I would like to advise everyone The human traffic of anybody who will be in at the showground There're people who drive into the showground because they have the allowed and the prescribed sticker Please drive carefully Do not run over people because people are too many and some of them are many of them are children Many of them are old people Many others are disabled and you should be extra careful and you who is in the showground walking uh you should be extra careful and watch and be careful See that see to it that you do not obstruct the vehicles Walk I know people walk on the roads inside the showground but then you have to be very very careful and listen to any vehicle coming behind you or in front of you or in uh uh from the side so that we see to it that no accident occurs and all of us are safe\n<$A> And that's road safety for this week Our guest was Chief Inspector David Kariuki of Traffic Branch Nairobi Area Until next week this is Wanjira Kago", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'ce88f1be-0923-49a7-97a3-71a32c07dbb7', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:00.991647+00:00',

{'text': "<$A> We present Kenyatta Day \n<$A> In this pre-Kenyatta Day programme briefly we look at what triggered Kenya's independence struggle European settlers started arriving in Kenya since eighteen ninety-six but in early nineteen hundred the settlers set a goal to establish in East Africa a new loyal white dominion securely in the principles of British tradition and western civilisation Later on a colonist association was formed by the settlers which pressurised the British government to introduce a legislative council They introduced a taxation so as to force Africans to work in their farms By nineteen twenties missionaries' activities especially education had produced some elite among the Africans who accepted European values and for some time acted as agents of western style civilisation But as from nineteen twenty-one they became the great critics of the colonisers and the western values In western Kenya the CMS Mission Station at Maseno produced the first group of African political leaders including the Reverend Simion Njende Reverend Ezeke Opende Ruben Omulo Jonathan Okwiri and Mathai Otieno among others In central Kenya also the first political leaders were mission boys Harry Thuku James Obuta Jesse Kariuki Joe Machuchu and Jomo Kenyatta This generation of educated Africans spearheaded the struggle for independence in Kenya But during the Second World War period all political associations were banned and several political leaders were detained at <O/> In nineteen forty-four an African was nominated to the legislative council to represent African interests Later Kenya African Union was founded and when Kenyatta came back from Britain he became its first president in nineteen forty-seven Kenya African Union demands became more and more radical They insisted on full political independence The Mau-Mau broke out in nineteen fifty-two leaving many Africans dead and others detained in hostile atmosphere All political parties were banned until nineteen sixty when the ban was lifted The main grievances by Africans which triggered the independence struggle included high taxes forced unpaid labour in position of registration ordinance the <ea/>Kiponde system loss of African land poor standards of education provided by missionaries and apartheid among others Eventually Kenyatta was released from detention in nineteen sixty-one and later nineteen sixty-three Kenya achieved independence On his release <ea/>Mzee Jomo Kenyatta was interviewed at a press conference at the Maralal detention camp.\n<$B> With all sincerity I can assure you that in my disadvantaged position and as a restricted person I shall try my best to answer your questions in the best way I can I hope that one day I shall be able to meet you as a free man And I think this will not be very long I trust that in asking me your questions you'll bear in mind that for over eight years I have been bottled up in the <O/> away from public life and world affairs During that time I have been greatly misrepresented by some of you but today I hope that you will stick to the truth and that you refrain from writing sensational stories about me Ladies and gentlemen through the medium of your newspapers I want to take this opportunity to thank millions of men and women of various races and nations who have and still are fighting gallantly for my release as well as for the release of my comrades who are suffering greatly great hardships in various detention and restriction camps I wish also to thank my brothers and sisters who have kept up this \n<$A> What was your weekend like I hope maybe you visited a theatre and watched a play maybe you went to a cinema hall and watched a movie and maybe you just decided to stay at home and listen to some music and maybe you watched uh an art exhibition somewhere in the city And I tell you welcome to this programme or this evening's edition of this program Preview a programme that gives you the latest highlights in both uh performing and creative arts Hello and welcome Amongst what we've lined up for you tonight is the formal launching of  the Wanija Players and also a critic and not uh forgetting our latest highlights of the weekend That is what is coming to follow after This Weekend\n<$B> This weekend the Kenya National Theatre was full to the brim When that kind of  thing happens it is news since it is the exception rather than the rule although it would have been desirable if the reverse were true Because we want it to be the rule we've got to ask why the auditorium was full On that evening a musical group Black Voices from Britain was performing in the country for the first time Black Voices is an a-capella group consisting of six members namely Andrea Green Sandra Frances Ann-Mary Bonnett Beverly Robinson Carol Pemberton who is the artistic director and Bob Ramdani who is the administrative director The fact that this was the group's first performance in the country was reason enough for enthusiasts to turn up in large numbers But I don't know whether not to suspect that it had something to do with our fascination with that which is foreign Under normal circumstances you will hear the excuses for people not attending shows at the Kenya National Theatre to revolve around the charge that the theatre is placed far from transport termini if it is not blamed too that ticket prices are too high If these charges were true then nobody would have watched to the Black Voices First the location of the theatre has not changed and then the show started at eight in the evening Secondly the tickets were priced at two hundred shillings per person take it or leave it But you should have seen the jostling at the door Watching the group perform one inevitably appreciated the fact that the members have great voices and they are putting those voices to good use Given that they perform without instrumental accompaniment their voices have to compensate and they do But as I kept looking at them one thing kept crossing my mind and that is Do we have singers of that calibre in this country I came to the conclusion that we do In fact I kept thinking of the tall vocalist with Musically Speaking <name/> Then I wondered whether we turn up in such large numbers to watch such our artists when they put up their shows I thought we don't and came to the conclusion that we had better support our artists with our presence the way we supported the Black Voices One thing you will almost always hear is the lack of financing among performing groups whether they are musical or theatre groups One thing that you will also hear is that it is very difficult to get sponsorship even if it is in the form of advertisement in the performance programmes You would notice however that Black Voices benefited immensely from just these very things that local groups hardly ever seem to get The advertisement in the programme was simply heavy If advertisers were as generous with local groups then performing art as an industry in this country would have taken off But again I feel that the advertisers have the same fascination with that which is foreign If not then maybe we do not approach the right sources or are not aggressive enough Leaving Black Voices alone let us come back to the school text Romeo and Juliet which has been touring the country for about three weeks When this play was touring Western Kenya three of the artists in the group Tony Jiguna <name/> Jeroge and Delano Longui abandoned the programme and returned to Nairobi ahead of the rest of the group which was still showing They named disagreement with the administration of the programme as reason for their act Despite the act the group went ahead and finished the programme having replaced them with other artists Elsewhere <name/> Players were staging <ea/><O/> the Kikuyu translation of Robert Silmaga's Mechangua and a similar thing happened The lead role Mwangi Kimani abandoned the group and hence put the group into the problem of getting another artist to do the part This is not the first time such things are happening but I wish it was the last time Why Agreeing to take a part in a production is a major decision which an artist cannot take lightly When such a decision is made the artists should be having the intention to last the whole production unless heavy personal constraints dictate against doing so This is because artistic engagement should be seen as a mission and therefore handled with religious view In the case of Romeo and Juliet it was a commitment for the whole nation considering that this is a play being studied and it is not the easiest to the schools The group doing the play has not tried but to strive to give the schools the best Now the best is not co-opting artists into major parts because those who are <O/> for those parts have chickened out What this leads to is embarrassment for the group and some sadistic heroism for the defecting artist It gives a poor impression of a group and that's very bad public relations for any other group that might want to embark on a similar problem It kills the moral of the other artists but more than anything else it forms a rather ugly entry in the curriculum vitae of the defecting artist This is simply because one of the greatest characteristics of an artist is reliability It is so much ingrained in some artists that they will crawl onto stage even when they are ill but just to ensure that they fulfil their contract with the group Even if they may not be the best stage artists their commitment earns them the confidence of directors It is this kind of artist that we need not the best actors who have no discipline Am I in any way exonerating the administration of the groups that have been hit by defection Not at all I am in fact saying that every time an artistic programme is being undertaken the terms must be understood very well in advance and the artists told what constraints to expect Furthermore the administrators must also respect their agreements with the artists It all boils down to the question of diplomacy As artists we are human beings and should be able to talk out our differences without resorting to measures that harm our art It should be advisable that every time a producer is recruiting artists he knows what artist he's dealing with It is advisable that every time an artist is getting into a production he or she knows exactly what the rules of the game are Otherwise the side breaching the agreement should be asked through court action to compensate the agreement party When this starts happening then our seriousness as artists will be recognised \n<$A> Would you like to go out during the next weekend Just get to know what is going to happen during the next weekend W Players complete their run of <O/> at <O/> session of Wole Soyinka The Trials of Brother Jero at the Kenya National Theatre tonight

{'text': "<$A> <name/> Gatheru an education officer of the National Museums of Kenya talking about the Olulula forest nature reserve In this week's edition of our programme we travel all the way to Nyanza province Mr Owen Zumbo is the acting curator of Kisumu museums and is going to tell us more about the Kisumu museum\n<$B> Nyanza province has many pre-historic and archaeological sites in which research has been done for many years Since the nineteen thirties Dr Louis Leakey and many others have excavated many sites in this region Thus it is a result of this site that the idea of a central museum in Kisumu came into being but the minister decides effectively In the nineteen seventies UNESCO came up with the idea of taking museums to the people thus creating regional museums Kisumu museum had thus a humble beginning when phase one in which was turned into the main gallery was constructed between nineteen seventy-six and nineteen eighty It was opened to the public on seventh April nineteen eighty Since then it has systematically grown and now encompasses phase two used now as education hall and multipurpose hall Snake park crocodile pond fresh water aquarium and traditional Luo home state they're all of Kisumu museum Like any other <O/> museum Kisumu museum is charged with the responsibility of collecting preserving and cataloguing natural and cultural history material for exhibition education and research Thus regional museums can be seen as an extension of the many  museums in Nairobi specialising in topics of interest to the region in which they occur The local community has thus to identify itself with the museum and the museum has to be seen to serve their interest The local community has a duty to actively participate in the development of the regional museum And that is why our museum has adviser committee appointed from the local community to advise and monitor development Exhibits our main gallery exhibits cultural history material from Nyanza province Western province and parts of Rift Valley There are a few cases on natural history at our museum The starved lion attacking a Volta beast and the <O/> on primates leopard and birds create curiosity among the many visitors who visit our museum The monkey on a beautiful old <O/> is admired by all our visitors Two cases are under construction One will house origins of man casts which are on very high demand by standard seven and eight and the other will house a gigantic <O/> which was caught in Siaya district nineteen seventy-eight by local fishermen It was given to the museum by fisheries department in Kisumu Kisumu museum has a modern snake house featuring a variety of venomous snakes from Kenya Since most of these snakes are poisonous they are securely kept in cages with glass windows Conspicuous snakes in this house are horned viper path adder forest cobra red spitting cobra Madagascar bore black spitting cobra green mamba and fifteen-foot python Plans are under way to put <O/> on display in the near future The horned viper was brought from the Kamega forest recently In the snake pit we keep non-poisonous snakes These include thunder snakes linkmarks black tree snakes juvenile pythons and <O/> which is <O/> There are three adult crocodiles in the pond and a juvenile in a small secluded pond otherwise if the large ones catch it they'll eat it At <O/> there are several species including fresh water turtles There is a giant tortoise which we understand was brought into Kenya in the nineteen thirties Surprisingly it is still going strong Such giant tortoises are known to live for about two hundred years There is a traditional rural homestead of a man with three wives and two sons An old man lives there who advises the community on matters concerning customs and family affairs Kisumu museum also has the best fresh water aquarium in Kenya featuring Lake Victoria fish Mr Njamenia who had both the snake park and the aquarium works in liaison with Mr Jumba a research scientist at Kenya Marine Research Institute at Kisumu It is possible to see over ten species of Lake Victoria fish at our Aquarium Activities of Kisumu museum Education is a very important function of all our museums in Kenya and National Museums of Kenya has been accepted as a supplementary educational institution At our museum we have a full-fledged education officer Naturally we employ trained graduate teachers with at least three years teaching experience The education officer is charged with the responsibility of making programmes for school parties which visit the museum The programmes are an interpretation of our exhibits which he simplifies for school parties to understand There are two kinds of programmes One <O/> programmes where he conducts museum tours explaining exhibits to school parties and colleagues Two - specific programmes where he gives a lecture on a specific topic followed by relevant film For school parties each individual now pays three shillings to enter the museum and college students pay five shillings To reach more people we also organise extensive services for schools and colleges Since it is very expensive to go out and visit one school we ask a number of schools to come together We go and give a lecture and film shows Occasionally we may have public film shows at market places Most our films are on conservation and specific scientific topics On first June this year we introduced culture activities at our museum on Sundays which include traditional dances drama mimes poetry reciting <O/> music at <O/> For listening or dancing we pay the artists an honorarium which is negotiable We therefore request the people within Kisumu to visit us and enjoy themselves For the Sunday programmes we just take the usual gate fee of ten shillings per person You'll be able to see the museum and enjoy yourself Outside stations As I said in the beginning we have several archaeological and pre-historic sites which fall under the jurisdiction of Kisumu museum Fort <O/> in the Kericho District where Doctor Louis Leakey found the remains of <O/> At Sonjo in Xhumo District there are two sites A pre-historic site of miocene period where homonoids similar to proconsul africanus lived An archaeological site and of <O/> stone age similar to that one at <name-/> <name/> and <name/> where Dr Louis Leakey found the remains of homo sapiens At Rusinga in Homa Bay District Miss Mary Leakey found the remains of proconsul africanus in nineteen forty-eight Kakamega Kakamega is a new development The district development committee has already approved our proposal from museum in Kakamega and we have been given a go-ahead to look for a suitable site Since we would like to set up a natural history museum to exhibit the natural diversity of Kakamega forest in particular and Western Province in general the land we want should be on periphery of the forest or in the forest itself Kakamega forest is of interest for us because it is the furthest extension of the Great Equatorial Forest which covered Africa many years ago It has unique fauna and flora The rare <O/> has been sighted at Kisere which is just a section of Kakamega Forest Jameson's Mamba whose bite cannot be treated is endemic here Mount Elgon peak can still be seen Thus a museum in this forest will form a wonderful research centre Thimlich Okinga I am going to dwell briefly on one archaeological site which the public is not aware of but once opened to the public it is going to be a very interesting and exciting site museum just like <name/> This is Thimlich Okinga Thimlich Okinga plural Okingin in Luo means a scaring bush will be stone enclosures Thimlich Okinga is situated in north <name/> location of <name/> division of Ngori district South Nyanza The site was declared a national monument nineteen eighty-three under the antiquities and monument act but no efforts were made to publicise the site It's about fifty acres and consists of large stone enclosures builded by a people whose origin we do not know about five centuries ago Distribution of these enclosures in South Nyanza The enclosures are not confined to <name/> only but distributed in the two districts of South Nyanza and Homa Bay The general size of these stone wall enclosures was fifty metres in diameter At Sindo the enclosures are about half a kilometre from the shores of the lake overlooking sheltered beaches to there before uh for uh handling canoes At Muru Bay one <O/> shelters are caved which is on a cliff on the shores of Lake Victoria The local people call it <ea/><O/> which means in Luo the end of the journey Their oral history however says this cave was used for protection There's pottery in the cave which needs an archaeologist to interpret its marvels The local oral history also has it that the general movement of this people was from north to south At <name/> modern law family live inside the Okingin The climax of this evolution was at village <name/>\n<$A> <name/> the acting curator of Kisumu museum talking about its activities", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'aba1decd-8fdc-4e86-8c80-52cc4d99cd4c', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:00.993405+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9605066180229187, 'non_english_score': 0.0394933819770813}
{'text': "<$A> Hello and welcome to another edition of the programme Do You Know In this week's edition we are going to look at the greatest officially recorded number of children born to one mother some of the fastest animals in terms of speed like the cheetah the fastest planes and motorcars in the world the first forces to be found and the longest canal in the world Do you know that the greatest officially recorded number of children born to one mother is sixty-nine These sixty-nine children were conceived by the first wife of Fjordon Wasselejew He was a peasant from Shuya which is two hundred and forty-one kilometres that is one hundred and fifty miles east of Moscow in the former USSR She was born in seventeen oh seven and died in seventeen eighty-two In twenty-seven confinements she gave birth to sixteen pairs of twins seven sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets \n<$B> This case was reported to the Moscow by the monastery of Nikovsky on twenty-seventh of February seventeen eighty-two At least sixty-seven children who were born in the period seventeen twenty-five to seventeen sixty-five survived infancy On thirty-first of January nineteen eighty-nine Mrs Marei Olivera who was born in nineteen thirty-nine in San Juan Argentina gave birth to her thirty-second child It is believed that all her thirty-two children are alive In another happening Elisabeth who was the wife of John Mot from the United Kingdom gave birth to forty-two children She married John Mot in sixteen seventy-six She died in seventeen twenty forty-four years after her marriage\n<$A> According to an inscription on a gravestone in Conway church cemetery Gwyned North Wales Nicolas Hooks was the forty-first child of his mother Alice Hooks He died on the twenty-seventh of March sixteen thirty-seven However further details are lacking for it has not been possible to collaborate or refute this report Mrs Elisabeth Greenwhile of <name/> is alleged to have given birth to thirty-nine children that is thirty-two daughters and seven sons Her son whose name was Thomas was the author of a book known as The art of embalming which was published in seventeen oh five \n<$A> Mrs Ada Watson who was born on twenty-third of June eighteen eighty-six gave birth to twenty-five children These included three sets of twins She died in hometown London on fifth of February nineteen thirty-four but who are the champion mothers of today\n<$B> Today's champion mothers are believed to be Mrs Margaret M C North who was born in nineteen twenty-three and Mrs Mirabel Constable who was born in nineteen twenty Mrs Margaret M C North comes from <name/> Heath Birmingham She has twelve boys and ten girls All these are single births but two boys died in infancy The second champion mother whose name is Mirabel Constable comes from Long <name/>Warwicks She has also twenty-two children This includes a set of triplets and two sets of twins\n<$A> Let us now turn our attention to the oldest mother to conceive\n<$B> Medical literature contains extreme cases of mothers such as Mrs Ellen Alice age seventy-two She allegedly gave birth to a stillborn which was her thirteenth child on fifteenth of May seventeen seventy-six This was in her forty-sixth year of marriage However the oldest recorded mother for whom the evidence satisfied medical certification was Mrs Ruth Alice Kissler who was formerly Mrs Sheppard She was born in eighteen ninety-nine and died in nineteen eighty-two She came from Portland Oregon USA A birth certificate indicated that she gave birth to a daughter whose name was Susan at Glendal in California USA This occurred on eighteenth of October nineteen fifty-six when she was aged fifty-seven years old\n<$A> In another happening Dr E Gras reported the case of one of his patients who gave birth to a healthy baby at the age of fifty-nine years and five months The woman had already a married daughter aged forty years Lastly according to a report in the Lancet of eighteen sixty-seven a woman reputedly aged sixty-two years gave birth to triplets She had previously born ten children However with the current trend of living it is very difficult to raise up many children \n<$A> Speed is relative Tortoises can only stand and look all in amazement as they are overtaken by the fastest of all their kind which is a giant tortoise It can travel just one and a half kilometres which is an equivalent of one mile in six hours In nineteen fifty-six the world was astonished when Dr Roger Bannister ran a mile in under four minutes Today such a time is common place for this distance In nineteen oh three Wilbur and Orville Wright piloted the first engine powered aircraft successfully Nowadays planes can fly at twice the speed of sound The Apollo spacecraft can reach a speed of nearly forty thousand kilometres per hour that is twenty-five thousand miles per hour When motorcars were first introduced an act of parliament was passed in Britain stating that every motorcar had to be preceded by a possum carrying a red flag as people were so scared of the speed at which the vehicles could travel Today's cars can travel at well over two hundred kilometres that is one hundred and twenty miles per hour What about animals Which is the fastest\n<$B> Animals have to move quickly to survive Some such as the cheetah chase their prey with lightning speed Over distances of a few metres the cheetah is the fastest land animal with a top speed of eighty-nine kilometres per hour which is equivalent to fifty-five miles per hour However it can be outrun by the strong horn antelope over short distances Some horses and dogs can also run fast Race horses have been trained at more than sixty-five kilometres per hour that is forty miles per hour What of plants which plants grow fast\nIn nineteen seventy-four a plant known as <name/> was planted in Malaysia Within thirteen months it had reached a height of ten point seven four metres that is thirty-five feet No other plant has been recorded as having grown so tall very quickly like this plant known as <name/> Another plant known as <name/> which is a microscopic protozoa has been recorded as having travelled a distance of forty times its own length in one second\n<$A> Leaving aside the fastest animals in the world and also plants which grow very fast let us now come down to the fastest motorcars and planes in the world\n<$B> A man known as Richard Melbourne felt a jolt as if he had hit a brickwall and heard a sound like thunder behind him as he drove his car Believe it or not he was travelling at over one thousand and eighteen kilometres per hour That is six hundred and thirty-three miles per hour At that time he broke the world land speed record This speed is many times faster than the fastest ships and racing cars but pales into insignificance when we think of the USA space shuttle which operates at a speed of over twenty-eight thousand kilometres per hour that is seventeen thousand miles per hour\n<$A> The fastest operational bomber planes are the Freeborn Mirage four which fly at a speed of two thousand three hundred and thirty-three kilometres per hour that is one thousand five hundred miles per hour \n<$A> And every year we normally have about three or four students carrying out their project at the Centre of Nuclear Disaster And the thing that we do to them is to teach them the technique and how to use equipment And as you can imagine if we're going to produce a full MA thesis every year and for the last four five years that's what we've done that's quite a good production Initially we were about two of us then another group two and that They were the early years It wasn't that productive but now we quite productive we are producing four three four theses every year In addition people who are not really doing masters master theses or you know research of that kind And they really just want to know what is in their samples They make use of our facilities And those ones have also benefited in the sense that our technique is not that expensive compared to others\n<$B> Yes how do you compare to others and how would somebody reach you and what kind of analysis do you do that probably will be beneficial to people in the rural areas for example\n<$A> Yeah let me start here by soil Somebody may be interested say in agriculture He wants to know uh how the soil uh what the soil contains in terms of micro-nutrients And that person would bring that sample to us and we only charge about five hundred shillings per sample and maybe twenty-five shillings per element extra element what he wants And once we've done the analysis that person is in a better position to know this soil of mine contains ABCD And uh if I go to now to say an agricultural officer he'll advise me what to apply to the soil That particular person will benefit from that If uh you consider say somebody who is dealing with effluents like uh Mr <name/> said he'd now want to know whether those effluents are uh toxic And you bring the sample and we analyse and we find say it has high levels of say uh lead and we would advise that company to do something about these effluents Instead of discharging it into the river they do a bit of re-treatment where it goes into the river You may be say uh somebody interested in environmental pollution like Mr <name> was with a uh another student and you want to know what is being produced by cars uh the emission You want find the lead levels in the emission And once the analysis has been done and you look at the data you can tell whether we are actually polluting our environment or not\n<$B> Yes now Mr Menaris on the basis of what you are saying and your other colleague says enormous amount of knowledge already existing in your centre uh Now how does this knowledge reach the ordinary person apart from exchange of ideas at seminar level forums of your peers How about the Kenyan population How do you reach them\n<$A> We try to participate in the factory workshop which is related to uh and where we can be able to express or give our uh findings to people both locally and internationally And in fact starting from this Sunday one of our colleagues has gone to Nigeria to present a paper on our findings And we've uh participated I think in all <O/> workshops since I think nineteen eighty-eight We also publish uh in established journals and I think uh once in a while you've read in the one of the few papers like mention of our findings And we try to use all the channels that are available including the one we are on right now\n<$B> Okay and what kind of Yes\n<$C> <O_><O/> some more on publicity \n<$A> We have also trying to participate in the ASK show Nairobi main one because it's nearer to us and always anybody visiting the university booth always sees something on the Centre of Nuclear Science Techniques We have been showing people how we can utilise it We also have been uh uh selling our centre through the mass medias on a <O/> We have a journal which is an international journal And uh scientists from all over the world and various laboratories are subscribing to it And uh this is one way where people can <O/> to it\n<$B> Yes how about the rural areas Do you think they would be fully understood always understood How do you reach them \n<$C> For the rural area for example one project we are doing with the faculty of agriculture it's getting to the farmers on preservation of their food post-harvest and harvest losses\n<$B> Through famine demonstration exposures or what\n<$A> Exposures and also trying to see whether we can also utilise nuclear technique in trying to alleviate uh this anomaly in the whole farming system \n<$B> Yes\n<$A> So this is something I think uh within the last three years we have really come to be known by quite a lot of people although there is still a lot more to be done anyway\n<$B> Okay\n<$A> But\n<$B> Fine \n<$A> <O_><O/>\n<$B> Yes Mr <name> I tender to ask you to comment briefly on the existing institutional collaborations nationally maybe the centre or the University of Nairobi\n<$C> We've uh The nature of nuclear science is such that it's very unlikely to only be working on an island of your own You tend to interact with other scientists And in Kenya what is being used mostly is isotopes And the areas where it's being used it's like <O_><O/> And by virtue of the fact that we we've got a centre for nuclear science which most people know about", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$C> Next is Breastfeeding Corner a programme that will come to you at a quarter to nine With you in the studio from now up to closedown is Tabitha Motemi It's now a quarter to nine Breastfeeding corner\n<$A> Breastfeeding Corner Babies need appropriate nutrition affection stimulation and protection against infection Breastfeeding meets these needs and gives them the best start in life It is natural and a basic part of the life process For breastfeeding to be successfully started and continued the mother needs the active support of her family the community and health workers All have a contribution to make Mrs Betty Multuri an officer with a breastfeeding information group compares an expectant mother to a host who is eagerly waiting for a very important visitor Such a host she says spends a lot of time doing everything possible so as to accord his visitor a grand reception An expectant mother starts preparing a few days before delivery\n<$B> The preparation starts with the mother and all mothers I suppose in Kenya today know that immediately the mother know that she's expecting she should go and see the doctor in the clinic Those who have got clinics in the city commission or in government hospitals we know that there are health workers waiting to help us and to start clinic to start being examined being uh guided on how to live with this pregnancy what to do so that we can be  healthy when carrying this baby and how to deliver is very very important for a mother to start antenatal clinic as soon as she knows that she's pregnant What we should do is to go to the clinic and you are seen by the doctor The important of being seen is to be guided on some of the difficulties and some of the uh uh illnesses minor illnesses which mothers encounter when she's expecting Not all mothers are  healthy Some mothers are very  healthy indeed when they are carrying babies but some mothers have complications Because you know the mother expecting a baby her body changes very much and these changes bring a bit of interruption in the body system and in the health of the mother Uh first of all you have to be checked if it's first baby to know whether the baby is uh you are healthy enough to carry the baby what you need what you need to eat and how you should prepare yourself Mothers should prepare themselves even before they know that they are pregnant They should be  healthy before pregnancy comes And this is to eat balanced diet so that the mother is healthy enough to carry a baby because this baby is going to use a lot of uh mother's energy and the mother should eat properly before she is pregnant Because the first three months of pregnancy many mothers have no appetite Some tend to vomit in the morning within one month to three months Some uh don't like even eating They eat very little and so it's good when a mother is well-nourished before pregnancy\n<$A> It is through your breasts that the baby receives all that she or he needs for a healthy growth and development Needless to say an expectant mother knows this Such a mother prepares her nipples during pregnancy by pulling them out gently After bath she rubs her nipples with a towel to make the skin stronger Some mothers express a few drops of milk every day during the last few weeks of pregnancy Mrs goes on to advise the mother what to do as she waits for her baby\n<$B> Mothers always have good breasts but we have different nipples And this difference in nipples we have to know earlier before the baby comes Some mothers have got very small breasts Others have got big breasts but the difference of sizes of the breasts does not matter at all Breasts which are big large small all of them have milk enough for a baby So we should not worry If you have small breast please <ea/>mama don't think that you'd you are not going to have enough milk If you have large breast also know that you have enough milk for your baby Sizes doesn't matter When you expect the body changes I want to tell mothers who uh experience to be mothers for the first time to know that your bra which you wear before you are pregnant you'll not be able to wear it because it will be you'll start enlarging Your bust you enlarge and then also your tummy will start enlarging That should not worry you You start having a very dark area on your breast which is called the aureola and becomes more darker when you are expecting and it starts even looking as though you have smeared a bit of uh uh fat or about uh something like lanolin because the body starts producing fat to prepare that nipple around so that it's ready for the baby to come and you know nature is very good God  prepares us before this baby comes Also milk starts coming in the breast and you start feeling inside your breast a bit of ticklish sometime That is the milk being prepared in your breast So you should not worry \n<$A> Breasts should be taken care of to avoid engorgement or the condition of being hard and even if a mother has flat or inverted nipples it's no excuse for not breastfeeding \n<$B> Some nipples are flat that you see very little of a nipple Others are very nice They're they look protruded outside and they are they look very nice You just breastfeed the baby without any problem I'm trying now to talk to these mothers who have got uh flat nipples The nipple is there but it's very short sometime you can't even see it <ea/>Mama you have to prepare yourself if you have got this flat nipple and how are you going to manage it The healthworkers in the clinic will help you They have something we call nipple-shield You just have to tell them about your nipples yourself Maybe the doctor will find out by himself when examining you If they don't find out how your nipples are please tell them Say my nipples are flat I don't know what to do Then they'll tell you what to do You you'll have something called nipple-shield as I have told you and they'll give you that nipple-shield and they'll show you how to put it on you fix it on your both nipples and you put a brown top so that the nipple is pressed inside It has a hole so the nipple will be pushed in that hole and will be always will be pulled out and by the time you deliver a baby your nipples will be out ready to breastfeed So if you do that you'll be ready for your breastfeeding If you don't have that nipple-shield you can use a jerry-can top Is very useful You just put two jerry-can tops on each one on each uh breast and you put your bra and it will keep on pulling the nipple and for the period you are pregnant by the time you deliver the nipple will be ready Another thing I want to tell mothers It's very important to try to express a little bit of a milk every day After you have a bath pull the nipples out and you roll them a little bit with your forefingers between your forefingers and express a little bit of milk That helps the mother to open the ducts These ducts are always blocked If you don't express the milk a little bit of milk they'll remain blocked and as soon as you have a baby as you experience some mothers soon after delivery they complain that the milk is not coming because the ducts are still blocked so the time for us to prepare yourselves is this time when we are expecting Every day after you have your shower express a few drops of milk from your from each breast to open these ducts to get ready for the milk to flow easily when you start breastfeeding \n<$A> After delivering a few problems might come up some of which arise in the first three days \n<$B> One of them is uh engorged breasts The second one is cracked nipples The other one is painful breasts and the other one is mother's thinking that the milk is not coming out I have solved that milk not coming out because when you express I told you the ducts will be open but about engorgement most of the time it occurs because we mothers don't put the baby on the breast on demand Any time the baby cries you put that baby on the breast so that the milk doesn't accumulate in your breast The milk is made each time the baby suckles She he suckles the milk which is made and after that the milk goes and then it get finished and then another one is made when the baby is breastfeeding again So if you don't empty that breast by breastfeeding on demand the milk will be remaining in your breast and that way that accumulation will make the breast engorged \n<$A> Mrs Betty Multuri from the Breastfeeding Information Group", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

what they have you stole for their fans \nA call for Kenyans to export talent and Germany based Kenyan musician John Simon back in the country today in Kenyan Beat News and Views \nKenyan music just like coffee tea and other cashcrops can be exported and fetch foreign exchange The failure in the task of popularizing our music to foreign audiences could be blamed wholly on the negative attitude of those who should be in the forefront But one point to ponder a popular Kenyan musician wants to go on an overseas tour to promote Kenyan music He approaches the United Nations Environmental Scientific and Cultural Organisation UNESCO Commission for Education with his proposals and objectives All the required arrangements including the funding is taken care of But the musician cancels the tour at the eleventh hour Or another musician equally popular approaches the same organisation for the same purpose and everything for the tour is approved and only await an itinerary from the musician He promises to bring the programme and that is the last that is heard of him It could be true that most of those who have been approached have exhibited a cold shoulder on or outrightly expressed open disinterest and dismissed the proposals presented to them by the artists At the same time when a promoter brings in a popular musician there is a hue cry by the local musicians that they have been given a raw deal and are being ignored Some outspoken musicians are not against the idea of flying in a foreign musician but are bitter when the same organisations who had been approached for sponsorship without success by local musician lavishly sponsor the foreign musician But have the  musicians exhausted all the avenues to better their lot Is there hope that one day they'll be able to share a common stage with internationally acclaimed musicians and receive foreign audiences Are they organized enough to lobby for such goals or is it their ill equipment and organizations that is their greatest undoing Are they themselves partly to blame Although most of them may not agree the avenues are there The hopes too are there But it is the committment of some of the musicians that has hampered the development and promotion of Kenyan's music abroad The UNESCO Commission for Education which is at Commerce House Nairobi has a scheme which if fully exploited could raise the standards of music The Commision Secretary General Chacha Ogwe told Kenyan Beat that the scheme is more or less a promotion of artists' programme and depending on the availability of funds from the UNESCO headquarters it should sponsor artists' projects annually He added that he has always been ready to assist musicians in their endeavours to promote our music and culture But year in year out the funds earmarked for the scheme end up unused due to the indifference of the musicians \nThere are about three programmes in which funding is done according to proposal and priority But in all of them the musicians have a big chance of putting their cases across for their own benefit The dialect in which a song is sung is secondary A good composition couple coupled with good arrangement and quality production will sell anywhere Our musicians should therefore stop bickering about who is not doing what but exploit all the possible avenues to improve their quality of music Benga music certainly appears to many people Today Kenyan Beat News and Views takes you to Migori where we meet one of the Benga maestros John Ouma Johnny the band leader of Omore Kings Some of you had written to us the request to feature this musician Omore Kings was started six years ago and has released some chart busters like Vicky Jaber duonda<ea/> and many others Omore Kings which is based in Migori Suna was started in nineteen eighty-six Some of the founder members who are vocalists are Oguda Otis Omondi Sinai bassist Samual Okidi and Idede Chips Some of them have left the band Ouma who has many other nicknames like Waka Waka told Kenya Beat that the group has modernized Benga making it easier to dance The band has a large following in South Nyanza and Nyanza Their current line-up is bass Samual

musician Gordon Simon is back in the country to catch up with the possible matters and spread his gospels of rock music according to a report appearing in one of the local dailies \nKnown years for his days with a Black Savage band Simon intends to spend four weeks here spreading a Jimmy Hendriks revival which shows in Mombasa and Nairobi He said the band will be called Wanasavage adding that he has brought a range of guitar effects for his musical preference Once playing with one of the very few rock bands here Simon went to the Germany in the early eighties finally settling at Hamburg He admits life is not a bed of roses out there and lack of a recording deal widely seen as a ticket to any other artist door to success kept him out of playing Before arriving here for a month long break he worked on tours with Maxi Priest and a jazz group called Inkognito His involvement with Germs a sound light company in Germany he said gives him additional skills as a sound and light man For two years he tried African music playing a lot of this and that and a lot of Benga which he said was a new dimension for him and for hundreds of fans who caught his band in action After playing rock with Savage in city schools here and producing an album with EMI Simon teamed up with Madagazkar's Rasaka Mawi who shared his Hendriks' learning and together awakened the city rock crowd He changed to Afro Music and stirred the scene with Koth Biro Europe is not easy he repeats and everything is determined by a good recording deal and that is not easy to come by The idea he said is to keep one afloat and work tot the music which is how he got to work as a sound and light technician \nSimon will be looking for new musical influences mostly on the lines of blending traditional African drum patters and lace them with synthesizer roughs And now looking forward to December Musicly Speaking fans in Mombasa got very good news The group will be in Mombasa From twenty-third to twenty-fifth they'll be

sustaining the industry taking music to the people Many of them told Kenya Beat that the only way to introduce their works to their fans is to go to them directly \nMusician cum producer Albert Gashero said musicians have realized that many cases of dubbing of their works is not intentional rather it is aggrevated by lack of original works Upcountry he said remains the greatest market for

{'text': "<$A> Welcome to the program In this edition we shall talk on the belief-systems of the Turkana who live in Turkana District Rift-Valley-Province \n<$A> Turkana region has a hostile climate For this reason the Turkanas' philosophy of life is shaped by his environment It doesn't allow material or spiritual luxuries A Turkana is so aware of his hostile environment that he does not resort to the supernatural and mystic sides of life Instead he follows a common-sense point of view and moves where the opportunity is available and exploitable An individual is therefore not bound to stick to a group if better conditions exist and are available elsewhere As a matter of fact the Turkana generally has a very independent cast of mind At the age of four to five years he's capable of thinking of and finding ways and means for surviving on his own There are many cases of children splitting from their parents as early as the age of five for better opportunities elsewhere The philosophy of self-sufficiency is deeply entrenched in their psyche In the Turkana religious beliefs they believed in the existence of a high god that they referred to as Acujo It was believed that Acujo lived in the sky He was said to be omnipotent and could kill people who committed wrong things Acujo controlled rain and rainmaking In Turkana community there were professional rainmakers who executed their trade in consultation with god However god never intervened in rainmaking unless he was actively induced to do so Communal prayers could be held for rain and in the case of healing a sick person Occasionally such prayers were led by a diviner \nIn Turkana community a *divinal> prophet is called Emron Any man could become a diviner but not women The powers and qualities of divination were not hereditary Diviners were initiated at two places <name/> and <name/> Turkana diviners appear perfectly normal with nothing in particular to distinguish them from ordinary beings They do not fuss over specific paraphernalia for treatment or divination Neither do they care for psychological mechanisms for diagnosis and treatment Some diviners acquire wealth as a result of fees paid for services rendered The payment could be a goat or some herd of cattle In Turkana community anyone could foretell the future by throwing down sandals and reading them Diviners however foretold the future by reading and interpreting the entrails of a goat or an ox He could also tell by directly soliciting and obtaining the required information from the high god In Turkana community there were magical diviners who are in a class of their own They could diagnose cure and advise the physically and mentally afflicted Their paraphernalia included pieces of skin which they used to ward off evils and to give the afflicted special strength and stamina from the high god A woman's barrenness could be cured through a diviner Likewise a diviner could magically protect one from danger and any other calamity It was usual for the diviner to communicate with the high god in a dream in his sleep During the dream god provided the prescription The principal treatment consists of smearing satin-coloured ocker grey blue green or yellow on a specified spot on the body Other treatment consists of strips of goat's skin or cow's hide to be used as general protective charms or in case of serious illness Divination was also practised prior to raiding and going out to war A diviner could sanction or advise against a military or cattle rustling adventure In most cases the diviner would order for the performance of a specific ritual These rituals involved the slaughtering of animals either a bull or a goat Specific parts of the slaughtered animal were then used in the ritual It was believed that the diviner acted through the powers of god It was important for people participating in the ritual to share the sacrificial meat The eating of sacrificial meat was some kind of bond where the participants express their willingness to share the consequences of the ceremony In southern Turkana <name/> and <name/> are places with permanent standing water These two posts are believed to be the residences of Adeti who resembles a man wearing a suit of baboon hair Periodically people disappeared from these places for two days and sometimes up to two months When they reappeared they were well fed and looked healthy It is said that the water Adeti took them to a place of abundant stock water grazing and food Invalids saved by the Adeti returned in perfect health Some of the diviners where initiated into their crafts through such disappearances The Turkana also had a vague belief in spirits Spirits were said to live in hills and mountains The spirits were generally said to be quiet However when they intervened in human affairs they were said to be very malevolent and came at night to mend people in their sleep In Turkana community certain animals and birds were associated with good and bad  omens It was believed that the spotted morning warbler warned of enemy attack by its chirping When the hawk eagle flew to the <ea/><O/> that is homestead it warned of the approaching murderer The appearance of the grey warren warbler announced the coming of a good visitor The death of a black kite in the <ea/><O/> was considered as a warning to the owner of the homestead He had to sacrifice a goat or else bad luck could befall him The grand hornbill green wood hobo spotted eagle or night <O/> and frogs were considered as prophets of rain In Turkana community evil is associated with stealing adultery and wild animals such as snakes Anything connected with pain and destruction is evil The Turkana was known to bury the dead particularly if the person died where they had settled for a long time The dead person was buried in a grave with gifts particularly from the closest relatives And now let us look at the history of the Turkana The Turkana have a verifiable myth of origin It says that a long time ago an old woman called Ngithigee came to eastern Turkana from Ngithigerr to gather wild fruits She went to the hill now called Murua Ngithigerr near Tarach river where she settled It is said that later on a bull got lost in Ngithigerr and came eastwards following Tarach until it reached Ngithigee's residence At night the bull slept in Ngithigee's compound From Ngithigerr eight young men who were Ngithigee relatives were sent to search for Ngithigee and the bull They travelled eastwards They found the bull and Ngithigee drying wild fruits They remained there with her for a few days and saw the place had good pastures and many kinds of wild fruits They returned to Ngithigerr and told the people about the wonderful place Hence a large group of young men and girls took cattle and went back to the east as though they were going to <ea/><O/> that is dry season cattle camps Therefore this group formed the first Turkana Most other Turkana oral traditions more or less concur with this myth They claim that after a generation of peace the Turkana begun to move eastwards When they left Tarach valley going eastwards they encountered the Samburu groups living in the higher areas of Central Turkana from as far north as Lokwanamoru Range near the Sudan border It is said that the Turkana stretched south to <name/> <name/> <name/> and <name/> and the hills called <name/> southwest of <name/> The traditions further claim that at first the Turkana only raided the neighbouring ethnic groups for livestock and thereby acquired camels for the first time However as time went by they took to waging sporadic wars against their neighbours According to another group of traditions the migrations which carried the Turkana from the land of <name/> in eastern Uganda started with a split that is a separation of the Turkana from the GiTheir ancestry and historical memories are shared with the Gi Thereafter the grazing and water needs of the stock dictated their settlement patterns and movements This trend more or less persists up to the present The Turkana are constantly on the move from the plains to the riverbank to the mountains and then back again and so on the whole time they build no permanent homes and settlements but live in temporary flimsy shelters Due to the tendency to move wherever grass and water is available the Turkana are understandably in endless competition and conflict with the <name/> <name/> <name/> <name/> <name/> <name/> and others Linguistic studies and the historical traditions of their western neighbours confirm that the Turkana Gi <name/> and <name/> have a common origin In the past land disputes over water and grazing land continued for a long time against their neighbours The Turkana had great military success Some historians attribute the numerous military successes of the Turkana to their military alliances with the Gi against whom it is said they never fought In pre-colonial and colonial times and despite the recurring violent conflicts the Turkana traded with their neighbours They traded cattle sheep and goats In return they received millet maize and maize meal tobacco spears iron cooking pots beads and ostrich eggs and feathers", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'aa7b73d3-308f-49d5-8015-2920c38bc612', 'added':

{'text': "<$A> and our cherished wildlife demands that we plant more trees and protect our natural resources for survival That is why Kenyans from all walks of life are being encouraged year in and year out to plant as many trees as possible Kenyans led by the country's leading environmentalist and conservator of resources His Excellency President Daniel Arap Moi have through sheer hard work and determination turned some dry parts of this country into green beautiful areas <Name/> in Kitui district of eastern province is one such place More areas can become as beautiful as <name/> if <ea/>wananchi plant trees at the right time They have been continuously reminded that our prospects and future problems are linked to the way we protect and exploit our natural resources The trees which are planted in agricultural and pastoral areas are important in that they after maturing provide <ea/>wananchi with firewood coal and other tree products Some trees are also used for making furniture while others are used for construction Another use to which we put our trees can be reflected in our desire to get poles and posts for fencing and supporting electricity or telephone transmission wires His Excellency President Daniel Arap Moi and other environmentalists have on several occasions decried the destruction of indigenous trees In some areas of our country indiscriminate felling of trees and burning of forestry areas have caused untold damage to fertile soil which we as a nation badly need for food production Realising that his people need to conserve the environment for use by future generations His Excellency President Daniel Arap Moi has been instrumental in the construction of <O/> for conservation purposes The President is a strong believer in conserving soil and the environment because it is our means of survival The emphasis in Kenya has been on indigenous trees Some government institutions private organisations schools and non-governmental organisations have come up with experimental tree nurseries with a view to discovering which trees are best suited for arid and semi-arid areas The Kenya Energy and Environmental Organisation KENGO is one body which has established an indigenous tree nursery at <name/> At Kanali on the main Nairobi national road a tree demonstration plot for indigenous trees has been established This project was started by His Excellency the President in nineteen eighty-eight <Name/> a creation of His Excellency the President have been established all over the country They support among other things the <O/> of the *encatchment> areas for our forests In most tree nurseries all over the country there are a variety of tree seedlings to pick from Nurseries have been established in every district with a view to making it easier for <ea/>wananchi to get trees to plant The cocoa planting area this year is expected to cover one thousand two hundred and forty-five scattered all over Kenya As you plant trees this year let us remember that it is a continuous exercise For every tree we cut down we should at least plant two to replace it In this way we shall be ensuring the future of our children\n<$B> We are uh actually having uh enough trees for everybody in this country to plant so uh we're asking everybody to turn out uh to the nearest nursery uh <ea/>wananchi will be given free of charge about five seedlings to plant and please when the <ea/>wananchi plant they should take care of those seedlings because that means everybody plants one tree and we are about twenty-five million You can uh realise that the country the whole country will be green within a very short time\n<$A> As we move into the future we should as Kenyans continue to get involved in environmental and conservation initiatives for the sake of our own survival and the survival of our own children In that way we shall be making the world a better place to live in \n\n<$A> Do you know what our critic has for us this weekend Over to Okumba Miruka\n<$B> Kenya is supposed to be a multiracial country consisting of a populace of Blacks Europeans and Asians This is a fact that is reflected especially in the economic face of the country but it is a fact which should be reflected even more in the world of art Well is it The answer could be either way depending on who is answering the question but to a large extent it would be in the negative What am I talking about Last Saturday and Sunday Madam Umadevi Haslos Corps de Ballett Groupe put up a show at the Kenya Cultural Centre The Indian classical musical drama titled Devi the temple dancer concerns the plight of a princess who was cast to a life time of temple dancing by a Gypsy queen Actually it is the princess that offers to take up the dancing career after the queen has sentenced the whole village of children to dancing and would only release them if a choice maid would be committed to the career The princess Devi who takes up the career goes on to become the finest dancer ever known Rather than the fact that it was an Indian dancer the story rendered in mime with voice-overs in English is based on a familiar motive that exists even in African if not also European mythology That motive is that of a precious member of the community having to be sacrificed for the benefit of the larger society In this is couched the whole question of selflessness the individual versus the society and the fact that an adversity can be turned into something positive In African mythology this motive is very heavy in stories about girls who are sacrificed so that rain may come to the community In other words Devi's story could be understood by anyone regardless of race This was further enhanced by the voice-overs in English but the audience was predominantly Indian and European perhaps the African audience believing that being an Indian dance it would be performed in Hindi and they would not be able to follow Whatever the case might be it is noticed that audiences impose on themselves some kind of segregation even when this is not called for This is a rather sad state of affairs which we would gladly see come to an end if we are to broaden our precision of culture and art In fact watching performances from other cultures other than our own also brings us face to face with the new art forms and styles of producing that we could integrate into our own In <ea/>Uma Devi's show for example one first appreciates the fact that as small a stage as that of the Kenya Cultural Centre could be transformed into a whole world of beauty and elegance to take a whole dance group in creating what is essentially an epic For the time of the show it was simply a transposition into a new world Secondly and what I thought was more important was the use of mime and the excellent choreography that went into the production A certain drama critic James Birihanse once wrote that the future of Kenyan drama lies in the use of mime as the language He wrote that mime theater knows no boundaries of language and if well used is capable of a higher level of communication than words could ever achieve One might not agree with him entirely but one could concede that mime is one way of getting all races together to appreciate art from diverse backgrounds Coming to <ea/>Uma Devi's choreography the stage was a limiting factor due to its small size but <ea/>Uma Devi got round this by creating successive rather than simultaneous routines making sure in the process that the most important parts of the story were not overshadowed by overlapping action This was particularly obvious in the last scenes where Devi the temple dancer stars with breathtaking dances at one time involving an acrobatic routine where the dancer steps on a pan and performs on it Taking the lead role in this drama was a fourteen-year-old student of Wisa Oshell Girls High School Davia Vengra Ashiskall is now in form three but she started dancing when she was three years old at the behest of her mother herself a painter She has been with Madame <ea/>Uma Devi for the last eight years during which she has learned Bagatab Baratkatien and Kutjibuti Steps Davia says she would eventually want to be a medical doctor but she does not think this should take her away from dancing which is not only a pastime for her but also a means of learning about people's mythology and spirituality Saying that she loves Barat Katien most because she enjoys heavy footwork Davia has also tasted a bit of African dance That was when she was in Aga Khan Primary School Although she likes African dance because of its heavy footwork she found out that it has more sound than she desires Her favourite combination is a dance with heavy footwork but calm lyrics But watching her perform it becomes clear that she is a natural dancer who could be equal to any dance The performance also featured Bini Batell Samna Batell Sheka Gupta At Chen Atchana Janda Nehal Scha and Nilesch Scha One of the shows was done to aid the Council of Human Ecology of Kenya <ea/>Uma Devi puts up only one production in a year Having come to the country some forty years ago she has successfully grounded Indian classical dance in the country and has trained a core of young dancers who will obviously perpetuate that tradition \nMeanwhile ending at Bakenyal National Theatre tonight is the play Born of a lesser God being staged by Nelin and Daikey artists This is a play based on the realisation that Africans are not necessarily inferior and that they should rise and assert themselves This play features Robert Kioko as Despair James Mongi as Dignity Irene Jo as Civilisation Kari Karia as Money Charles Morunga as Uncle Amay Angela Mangu as Principal and Jaki Kiliria as

Dixon Okumu and Michael Lejodi\nOver to the world of fine art Anabel Wanjiku is exhibiting her works at the French Cultural Centre up to the end of the month Wanjiku is a well known Kenyan artist who

{'text': "<$B> musician Julius Kanewe otherwise known as Bilo as he cruised along Nairobi's busy <O/> Road The song details the laws a woman should obey in the house if she does not want to risk divorce or worse Half of the passengers in the <ea/>matatu were women and most of them were not amused by the song and they wondered why the driver kept playing it as if it were the only one in the cassette Some of them alighted in protest and accused those who were left behind for being half-women who enjoy hearing and seeing their lot being ridiculed by male chauvinists I would like you to listen to this song titled or <ea/>Baba Kune and then we shall discuss it and see why it generated such a reaction from the women \n<$B> In this song the artist says where can they get an older woman who can cultivate the whole of the <ea/>shamba properly I keep on cultivating but it never stays for a day before weeds come back I seem to be blinded I feel like I can go mad when I know how much I have done The <ea/>shamba here refers to the woman The man has tried to train her and shape her but it has not worked So he says after cross-examination I have found out that all she needs is a set of regulations and the woman and her son Kune need to know that this is the year of discipline So he gives the following set of regulations One if I ever cough outside and you do not open the door you will stay out for twenty-four hours like a watchman Two if I ever come late and you ask me why I am late I shall stay for one month without eating food that you have cooked Three if I ever ask you anything and you become stubborn you will drink me and sneeze me out like one does with tobacco Four if I ever hear that you have gone to a neighbour to gossip to plait your hair or ask for salt and many other things that day you'll know why men eat bread that have been dipped in tea From this song you can easily see the artist's attitude towards women If a wife is like a <ea/>shamba what is implied by such an image It could mean that you can buy it and in this case you can work on it until it takes shape and colour that you want You notice also that <ea/>Baba Kune threatens a wife with not eating her food for one month What does this say about the role of women in the society that the artist comes from We do agree that the artist is saying that it is not only a duty for the woman to cook for her husband but it is also a privilege There is something very important in the article that I read at the beginning of this programme that refers to this song Let me now bring out some of the issues it raises These are that the people has demonstrated by the women's boycott of the <ea/>matatu not only enjoy the music they hear but also listen and respond to the messages that are communicated through oral literature that there are those who want to use oral literature to communicate their views This includes the artists themselves Kanewe in this case who says I did not mean to annoy women All I'm doing is advising them not to be rude to their husbands if they want their marriages to last There is also the driver who keeps repeating the record for the women to hear All these people understand the value of oral literature and what a powerful tool for communication it is This is something that we cannot underestimate As teachers however as we said in our programme on fieldwork we cannot make students aware of contemporary oral literature without ourselves being aware I suggest that we listen to for instance the radio programmes particularly in vernacular programmes where artists are in various voices talking to majority of the people in this country We have to remember that the singers who create in their mother tongues are communicating with the young the old the literate and the illiterate and they are saying something to them as Bilo quoted above does There is also a sense in which these artists have been heavily influenced by their people's traditions and as you know language is a vehicle through which culture is transmitted and therefore original languages are closer to the people's culture From a song like the one we have heard there are very many issues that one can discuss This could be the artist's message the artist's attitude towards women the artist's attitude towards marriage the artist's use of traditions and the artist's use of language In yet another song by the same artist <ea/>Mama Kune the woman is given a chance to present her case So she says in a song I'm always too busy I have even forgotten to joke I don't want you to drop me like you do like a gourd of water or hot <ea/>ugali Kanewe bring elders to send me back home When you have enjoyed long enough you'll come back and find me and <ea/>Baba Kune replies What have I done <ea/>Mama Kune Let me tell you this is not <ea/><O/> or <ea/><O/> that you're asking me to dance I don't even know the first step One needs to be guided <ea/>Mama Kune then replies you know very well my dear that when you leave the house you never come back I don't know where you sleep If you come home and I give you food you never take it If I ever make the mistake of asking you where you have been you hit me with that food you beat me like the drum so that the <O/> people ask if there is a service going on <ea/>Baba Kune says you know very well that no newcomer brings warmth If I ever come later or not come at all I have been looking for property so if you talk badly even a slap you will get <ea/>Mama Kune says one who doesn't know my darling knows when she is told but you if I ask where you have been you will say you don't sleep on your ears you have been on business I ask what kind of business is this and I know it is not overtime How come it is always at night At the end of the song <ea/>Baba and <ea/>Mama Kune agree that there should be dialogue and that a separation will be as difficult as changing the title deed of the land You can see how well this artist presents the misunderstanding of wives and husbands in this song and the influence the song could have on the audience In order to fully appreciate this song you could ask your students the following questions Why has the woman forgotten to joke Why does the woman want to be given to elders that would send her home What does it say of the woman when she tells her husband that he will find her at home when he is through with enjoying life What is <ea/>Baba Kune's attitude towards the wife Do you consider the decision that their parting should be as difficult as a changing of the title deed justifiable What do you consider to be the status of women in this society These kinds of questions should help a student to understand and appreciate a piece of work even more At this juncture I would like to reiterate that it is not enough to tell the students to listen to the programmes on the radio It is important to take a piece of work a song for instance or <ea/><O/> and analyse it as we have done here discuss the themes and the language Let the students discuss with others songs from their various communities and the students will be richer Let them discuss their favourite musicians local artists or even foreign artists And in this way you will help them to have an appreciative mind and a critical one too Finally I would like you to listen to a record by <name/>The song is titled <ea/>Kwaheri <ea/>Bwana Like Kanewe's song that we have discussed it deals with the misunderstanding of a husband and wife As you listen to it I would like you to think about the following questions What is the woman's attitude towards her marriage What does <name/> say about the status of women in this community Who in your view is to blame for the breaking up of this marriage What precautions had the woman taken to maintain that marriage What do you think about the appropriateness of the tune of this song What do you think is the artist's attitude towards the husband of this woman", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '63d49315-6047-4a1d-9b93-3d73840dab82', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:00.998528+00:00',

see the sprawling unlovely and unloved satellite estates of East Nairobi Uhuru Buruburu Umoga Karibangi Pandora Bahati Donhom Kayole Kaloleni Makadara Ofafadorico Harambe Kimathi and Bahati where Nairobi's workers live through nightmares about their struggle to pay the rent for an apartment or just a room on their way to nightmare journeys to work on dangerous and overloaded buses and <ea/>matatus\n<$A> But a city is much more than its houses A city is its people and their activities Even those visitors who break out of the tourist time world will see little beyond the structures the shell of the city It is what goes on inside the shell that turns a city into a cultural pinnacle and powerhouse the flagship of civilisation the most concentrated and accurate expression of that society's values and level of development\n<$B> So what has gone on recently in Nairobi and what goes on today What are or what have been the most important social gossiping the things about which we can be justly proud secretly ashamed desperately worried or deeply perplexed\n<$A> By far the most important recent and continuing event has been the growth of the city and its population The statistics which have little human impact tell a story of growth from about three million in nineteen forty-eight to about twenty-five million people in Kenya today\n<$C> Nairobi's population has grown from a hundred and fifty thousand people to two million -\n<$A> This growth growth this growthRRR has been the result of several reasons\n<$B> Demographic increase women having babies faster than old people dying refugee increase movement of people from neighbouring states now or recently experiencing civil disorder such as Somalia Uganda Sudan Rwanda Zaire and Ethiopia other official and unofficial refugees Refugees' movements in developing regions of the world usually result in rural refugees becoming urbanised The country areas are too conservative and offer too few social and economic opportunities for refugees Mobile educated town refugees naturally gravitate to the centre of economic activities\n<$A> Economic increase which assumes that as the country develops the concentration and expansion of economic activity in the capital city will continue and thereby attract traders and workers from the rural areas\n<$B> Opportunistic increase The perception that the streets of Nairobi are paved with gold and belief that the big city is somehow more exciting that the village will attract young men and women looking for work riches and excitement\n<$A> Destitution increase then arises from the belief that it will be impossible not to find some relief in such a concentration of affluence that comes most surely from such an overloaded table This attracts more people from villages and the rural areas who have somehow slipped through the mutual support network which characterises rural subsistent tribal life into genuine insupportable destitution\n<$B> We experience this growth in a variety of ways In the pressure on public services and public <O/> Public transport can be a nightmare of bruising pinching elbowing and near suffocation There are too many passengers facing too few seats\n<$A> Public hospitals can't cope with the normal demands needed by a population which is much too large for the facilities and funding levels assigned to it Too many of the people swelling Nairobi's population are dependants or *destitutes> whose major characteristic is the inability to contribute economically\n<$B> We experience city growth in the form of rising crime rate <O/> theft and violence epidemic Just as young girls are forced into subsistence prostitution so do young men tend to a life of subsistence crime Just as our health services are becoming swamped by a combination of too many patients and too few tax contributors so too are police forces being swamped by too many crimes and too little resources\n<$A> Those with many tend to evade taxes and invest directly in their own private security Platoons of private guards packs of dangerous dogs steel gates barbed wire radio alarms electric fences and bodyguards\n<$B> The poor are resigned to be robbed from time to time Ordinary Nairobi residents don't carry large amounts of money hide their jewellery and keep a low profile Taxi-drivers hide a heavy spanner or similar weapon under their seats and often carry a friend at night for protection Respectable women disappear from public places by eight p m Only very desperate ladies and hardened delinquent girls walk with great risks on the Nairobi streets at night We see the expansion of the City in the number of beggars and particularly children on the streets The few regular cripples who had their well-known static positions on Government Road or Saddler Street have been replaced by fast-moving packs of children and equally mobile young men and mothers with babies Motorists frequently jump red traffic lights at night to avoid stopping in the town In the daytime motorists at junctions keep their windows up and their doors locked It's a good time to be selling car air-conditioners It's a bad time to be an Aids orphan\n<$A> Those which children experience Nairobi's phenomenal growth in the decline of the quality of the overcrowded poorly funded state schools and the shortage of places available in mission and other subsidised schools The rapid expansion of private schools reflects the public's dissatisfaction with the state education system\n<$B> In secondary and tertiary education the situation is even more acute The universities in Nairobi are now so overcrowded that teaching standards are falling Hostels no longer provide conditions to which students can study efficiently\n<$A> Other city services are creaking badly or have more or less failed as a result of the rapid and unregulated expansion of the city Garbage collection and disposal for example is not keeping pace with garbage production\n<$B> Many of the recent peripheral housing developments are not yet connected to piped water supplies and water pressures are now regularly too low to deliver water to all householders\n<$A> Roads are gradually becoming potholes to the stage of being dangerous to users Drains are incapable of handling the normal rainfall patterns and less than one third of the streetlights actually work\n<$B> Housing is in short supply and is too expensive for many residents Much of the housing stock appears to be controlled by profiteering landlords who show no restraint in hiking rents and evicting families self-help houses construction groups have been set up with the assistance of NGOs to build affordable houses but too many residents still live in shanties in the open or have to share very overcrowded rooms\n<$A> We see the expansion of a city in the growth of what is called the informal sector and the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> artisans Open spaces are filled with kiosks and petty trading activities Kiosks in the suburbs sell anything small at more or less any time They are both a convenience and a problem It's convenient to get milk and bread outside the gate but it's a problem if your property value goes down because there is a street of kiosks lined up along your garden fence It's a problem if the kiosks are noisy at night if waste paper litters your entrance if kiosk operators carry out off-duty thefts Kiosks are unplanned and lack water electricity and sanitation but they do provide a living for poor unskilled and unemployed people The kiosk problem is one which requires an intelligent and humane solution Rigid enforcement of planning and zoning regulations which may have been suitable for a town like Oxford in England but which have little relevance for the rapidly-growing capital city of Kenya is not certainly the answer\n<$B> The informal sector expansion has turned road junctions into paper-shops Magazines and framed pictures key-rings and toys are now available as you wait for the light to turn red As the traffic gets heavier and the informal sector grows we can anticipate the ultimate one-stop mobile shopping experience Nigeria-style There will be tea and cakes manicure and hairdressing household goods and car-washing\n<$A> The informal sector has already more or less replaced the city counsellors as collectors of parking revenue in many parts of Nairobi Motorists have regular parking attendants who protect the car clean and wash it move it to empty bays and their service actually equals the car's valeting services of Beverly Hills\n<$B> Informal sector snacks and meal services provide affordable food for city workers and residents of estates With no rates no rents no living no VAT and no taxes it's not surprising that the kiosk snack has become a critical part of the poor man's life support system In many cities in the Third World these meat restaurants provide by far the best food at a fraction of the cost of a restaurant meal Nairobi is fast catching up and kiosk night-out with a distinctive Nairobi cuisine is probably just round the corner\n<$A> Your <ea/>Kali car repairs and servicing are now a familiar sight in Nairobi Everyone knows where he can go and get a bit of quick welding to that failing exhaust system That tail of motorists buying back their own stolen wing-mirrors or wheel-hubs from <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> mechanics are common\n<$B> Any shade tree can become an informal sector barber's shop and on a sunny day who wants to sit inside and pay through the nose\n<$A> The alleys and lanes of Nairobi City Centre and some of the wider pavements are clogged with traders selling curios cheap jewellery ties shoes handkerchiefs cosmetics pens matches cigarettes and almost anything small which could have fallen off the back of a lorry or pilfered through the factory fence Their prices are as keen as their eyesight which enables them to keep ahead of the city <O/>\n<$B> Traders with vehicles or barrows have set up informal vegetable and fruit market at strategic points to catch commuters The <ea/>Mamamboga appears to be waging a winner war against the Council Their vegetables are fresh and cheap And the benefits for local farmers in cutting out middlemen and avoiding regular market overheads and taxes seem to be irresistible These informal vegetable-sellers are following the honourable traditions of London's thieves and barrel boys and Bangkok's floating wet markets A novel and menacing informal sector activity is road repair", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> This cover essentially introduces the idea of the book that women and environment are partners which affect each other differently in which case they have to coexist How this interaction is to take place is covered in the nine essays by Kenyan academic women namely Tabitha Kanogo Wanjiku Jiuri Akinyi Nzioki Janien Sakkasiani Wanjiku Kabira Mary Omosa Grace Sani Lucia Omondi Janet Kabeberi Macharia and Maria Nsomo\nThey write about women as they relate to the environment physically artistically historically linguistically and legally\nTabitha Kanogo sets the ball rolling in the very first essay titled Women and Environment in History She looks at the land use patterns in Africa in the pre-colonial and the colonial periods Writing about the pre-colonial period Kanogo contents that shifting cultivation was neither *hyposite> nor unscientific because there was an intimate knowledge of soil types and their sustainability for different crops This type of knowledge was mainly held by women who were the family cultivators of the land She writes and I quote <quote_><quote/> Tabitha's train of argument is that shifting cultivation afforded women a larger say in the management of land This say she states was taken away by the colonial structure which redefined land tenure dispossessed the women and set the stage for environmental degradation This was particularly so with the onset of cash crop farming On this Kanogo writes and I quote <quote_><quote/> end of quote She concludes that land shortage led to cultivation of marginal areas such as slopes which portrayed women as land miners insensitive to or unwilling to adopt improved methods of agriculture\nWanjiku Jiuri and Akinyi Nzioki take a similar stand that women cannot avoid being seen as the perpetrators of environmental degradation In the essay Invisible Managers of Natural Resources the two argue that women are the traditional providers of food water and firewood All from the natural resources of the God-given environment But they are severely inhibited in the proper management of this environment by legal structural and cultural constraints Moreover imagined problems like pollution make it more difficult for women to supply clean water and vegetables which suffer from both atmospheric and soil pollution They capture the helplessness of the woman when they write and I quote <quote_><quote/> End of quote\nThat looks like a pretty hopeless situation What is there to be done There are three essays in the collection which give us an inkling as to what needs to be done now that we have lost the past and its regulatory practices One of these is Story-tellers and Environment by Wanjiku Mukabi Kabira Using specific narratives Wanjiku illustrates the fact that the society's oral literature plays a very important role in the understanding of the environment and points to means and ways of its preservation The stories introduce us to the fauna and flora in our surroundings enlighten us on the harm done to these by natural calamities such as drought and by man and asks several questions to sensitise us to environmental matters If we come across certain names of animals and plants in the stories for example can policy workers determine whether these animals and plants still exist Can they be rehabilitated Can they be protected Kabera concludes in the essay that artists are sensitive needles in the society What they say observe and record can be used to reconstruct rehabilitate and preserve the environment she writes\nThe second essay about what can be done is Kabeberi Macharia's Women and Environmental Law in Kenya Kabeberi starts by discussing the various acts dealing with environment She therefore talks about acts on water forests settlement urbanisation and agriculture Then she turns to the crucial question as to whether the pieces of legislation address themselves to gender as a factor in environmental management Her conclusion is to the negative and she explains <quote_><quote/> She writes <quote_><quote/> End of quote Her suggestion is that the laws be amended to recognise the role of women in environmental management In doing this women must be actively involved she argues\nThen comes Maria Nsomo who has been known to be quite strident about issues affecting women in the recent past Nsomo looks at policy impacts on women and environment She cites that until recently women have been the forgotten factor in environmental policies in Kenya as they have been in many other areas Apart from the fact that women feel the brunt of environmental degradation and are likely to be its greatest perpetrators Nsomo also sees that they are also the most affected by any economic austerity measures like the structural adjustment programme She therefore talks of a policy restructuring to address the imbalances in the allocation of recognition and responsibility to women with regard to the environment First she suggests that women be involved in decision-making processes at all levels Second she feels that policy makers should consider the plight of poor women whose depravity will reflect badly on the state of the environment Third she suggests that all women's groups involved in conservation work should be aided by the government both materially and morally She also pleads that affirmative action be directed to the food sector and that environmental awareness be promoted at all costs\nThe other three essays in the book are based on case studies of women in soil and water conservation in Kitui energy in Bura irrigation scheme and the role of language in agriculture in Siaya District Factually speaking this collection of essays comes in at the right time and addresses a very relevant issue It is the first attempt to consolidate scholarly work on the role of women in environmental management in Kenya and is directed at policy makers researchers and students Although that relevance cannot be gainsaid a number of the essays included seem like they were written for other forums but have now been adopted to fit environmental concerns and women But the majority read well and carry statistics which augment the arguments advanced <Name/> Sakkasani the editor of the book is a senior lecturer and acting director of the population studies and research institute at the University of Nairobi She is widely published in matters of migration including refugee movement in Africa fertility family planning and gender issues She specialises in social demography and has done commissioned research for leading international as well as national organisations In compiling this book she joins Anna P Obura the author of Changing Images and Wanjiku Kabira Muthoni Karega and Elizabeth Nsioki of Our Secret Lives in articulating the needs of women in modern times\nAnd on that note listener we come to the end of Books and Bookmen today In today's programme we looked at Groundrock - African Women as Environmental Managers edited by <name/> Sakkasani and published by Acts Press in nineteen ninety-two On behalf of the producer George Okore this is Okumba Miruka saying good-bye \n\n<$A> This is culture talk A programme that focuses on modern trends in all cultural and ethical development In today's programme we focus on the population crisis in our society today There are very many people in our society who are in deep trouble with their extended families This trouble has a reason out of the fact that they not want to <O/> tradition and get as many children as their extended family wishes Indeed in some cultures in our society one needs to get many children in order to name all his or her relatives who might be dead or alive If one lives in an urban area and has only two children he's looked at by his less affluent brothers and sisters uncles mother and father as lost To these people who encourage large families the point is children provide security at old age Secondly they are a form of wealth You will hear them boasting in rural bus that they have large families and that they are tougher than the educated who fear to get children A large family is therefore a source of pride so to speak Even if the children won't make it or are malnourished this is not a serious point to consider The question that one <O/> one to us is how shall we provide jobs for all these people who need to work How shall we insure provision of adequate basic needs for instance housing education and food For a pure <O/> cause how shall we initiate and carry out media-economic development projects when the gains are offset often before we can even prepare by having to be divided among an ever larger number of people Indeed the social and ecological impacts of overpopulation are serious wherever they occur I am aware of the fact that there exists a heated debate among experts about whether or not the world can produce an adequate amount of food to feed its population What is not debatable however is that large numbers of people are not now being adequately fed Most of the world's hungry live in the non-industrialised countries such as ours Incidentally many of the African countries cannot produce enough food to feed its people In a sense increasing numbers of people in such countries are being kept at the same inadequate level of nutrition The relationship between population and food supply is brought into focus when we realise that a little of one acre of farm land is required to produce the minimal amount of food each person requires Increasing the crop yield of each acre requires expensive tools and methods beyond the rich of most poor people And a <O/> like ours cannot simply afford the agricultural equipment and <O/> desperately needed As a result most of the ever increasing population must live with the pain of hunger on a daily business and enormously high rates of disease and death because of malnourishment In addition according to accepted economic thinking to raise the economic standard of its people a nation with a stable population must be able to invest between three and five per cent of its annual in new income producing development The whole population is growing at a rate of three per cent a year like ours An investment of up to twenty per cent of the national income is necessary before any raise in the nation's economic standard can take place It is important to realise that a population with a growth rate of three per cent a year doubles in only twenty-four years And it would acquire near miraculous import on the part of a nation for its economic development to even <O_><O/> with such population growth \nIt should be understood that for an underdeveloped nation like ours we are simply struggling to achieve a bare subsistence level for most of our people Thus where as the industrialised nations are attempting to distribute more equitably their considerable national wealth and are <O/> to a substantial degree of population growth the underdeveloped nations such as Kenya are struggling simply to achieve a mere subsistence level for its people So when will our people understand family planning is necessary not only for individual development but also for national development Again one notices that women bear over eighty per cent of the burden of raising the children In many rural homes the women are malnourished and overworked because of successive pregnancies without proper medical care and food What is happening in our society is that the bread winner is struggling to support expanding families In most cases they are unskilled labourers who work at dawn to dark at low paying jobs in order to provide even their subsistence for themselves and their dependants And when drawn by rumours or bridges they move their families to the city where they find the pay more better and the cost of living is far higher than in the village they left In addition there are vast consequences of these production of more children than the society needs or can use carries over into the next generation To <O_><O/> property requires among other things education But a nation most of whose people have barely enough food to live can seldom build many schools or", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '3362402c-0a92-4a19-a487-957cdfc916ea', 'added':

{'text': "<$A> In this you know and because they know that society disapproves of the which of them some of them just exclude themselves They don't even wait to be expelled from school It is you know inappropriate policies like these that we would wish to really get rid of and you know there it is on issues like these in the issues like legal uh status of women in various countries you find some in some countries there are still provisions within the law that discriminate against women When women know what other women in other countries have done to overcome such legal barriers then they are encouraged to tackle issues like that in their own countries\n<$B> It is in such areas therefore that FEMNET assists non-government organisations to work together to focus on the overall need to insure the promotion of equal opportunities for women in society and their equal representation as both participants and beneficiaries in the development process However actions must be left at the national level\n<$A> FEMNET would depend very very much on national women's organisations which are *interfiliate> in any one country What we try to affiliate are the uh umbrella organisations in any one country and it is these organisations with whom we share information about successful strategies that are being used the world over Africa in particular to overcome some of these problems So as I say as a regional organisation we provide information That is the most important thing We are very very much interested in keeping up-to-date with the latest research in any one field in the health of women for example to know how women you know really suffer <O/> have a backache The other woman has a backache but she has no time to go to any health institution to be attended That woman would take her child to the clinic but she'll not tell the doctor or the health personnel that she has a backache or she her knees are aching and so forth We're trying to activate women's organisations to really impress upon women that their health is very very important and that kind of information is best communicated by women's organisations because you know it's only the wearer of the shoe who knows where it pinches\n<$B> There is a need for networking activities which promote focus on women's development as an issue which cuts across different areas of endeavour FEMNET therefore has the important role of assisting NGOs in collaborating and networking to improve the impact of their efforts in these different aspects of women's development\n<$A> First of all because there's a lot that is happening the world over The one thing you will find women here in Kenya and in other African countries lack is awareness is information Women seem to have difficulty getting information about what is happening not only in their own countries but around the world also And their idea is that you know the women's decade will have lost its meaning completely if we allow that situation to continue As you know the women's decade came and went and many rural women even in the urban area did not know there was a women's decade and therefore their efforts to uplift their <O/> you know uh were undertaken in a kind of vacuum without that background of you know goals that had to be reached targets that had to be achieved and you know in the absence of goals and targets you really don't perform well It's really keeping women in touch with you know where we are going like in a process of democratisation The women's organisations have really come up for the first time since independence and try to impress upon women and men that it is important for women for to begin to participate not merely as voters which they've always done but as participants in the democratisation process That freedom to express their views to express their priorities this is what we are really looking for And I'm delighted to tell you that it's happening everywhere not just here in Kenya in Zambia you know and in Tanzania everywhere Women are beginning to see that their vote is power and that they can use it to their own advantage We are saying elect women okay elect men that are gender sensitive and then when you bring issues let's say the priorities that you have these are the people that will be attending to them These are the people you are putting in the in decision-making process in Parliament\n<$B> Dr Chachukia feels that the motivating factor for this awakening is the democratisation process\n<$A> For once you have a situation where people are free to express their feelings I'm sure this this thing was there even before okay but the fact that you know women have gained awareness women have gained education in Kenya this is not a group that we are dealing with at independence The women at independence felt you know they had performed their role in freedom movement okay but they did not feel that they had a capacity to stand for election they did not feel that they had the capability of going to Parliament There were barriers that still exist for the ordinary woman like the language barrier for example you need to pass in Kiswahili and so forth but you know thirty years later they have educated their daughters and this is what they expect of them They expect them now to take up the mantle and express their needs and priorities better than any male parliamentarian has ever done We are not just talking about Parliament We are talking about the local authorities We are talking about the school committees the church committees Women have to become visible and it is you know that process of development then you know and a stage where they feel they are important that is where we have reached in nineteen ninety-two Women in Kenya need to aspire towards full and effective participation in the development of our country It is true that women in the rural areas participate effectively in agriculture They participate too much in fact because they are the farmers of this country They are the leaders in the process of food production and cash crop production What we are saying is that they do need to be represented where decisions are made in a *corporative> movement at you know the co-operatives that are marketing what women are producing women's role should be effectively heard and as I say in all other sectors of life this is really what women should be aspiring towards Secondly women aspire for the best for their children and what women in Kenya must realise is that children mean all children both boys and girls and that women in Kenya really need to encourage and support their daughters so that you know they can reach the highest levels\n<$B> The various NGOs under FEMNET have a focus of interest in terms of concern with different areas of social life Also the target group always includes women often a majority of women\n<$A> Some NGOs are in education The church organisations for example have been very involved in education uh They identify areas that have been left behind like the remote areas of Kenya in Turkana in <name/> You'll find many of our churches are involved in the education in those areas They're involved in health in primary health care Again many non-government organisations which <O/> uh Kenya Medical Women Association and you'll find equivalents of these in other countries Some are specialised others are you know dealing in general programmes So being they look at what the issues are and they you know try and support women in those areas\n<$B> One of FEMNET's themes is to create an infrastructure and channel through which NGOs will reach one another and share crucial information knowledge experiences and thereby sharpening and improving their inputs into Africa's development As the evaluation of the women's decade reviewed efforts in that separate development of women would not succeed\n<$A> This was a result of you know scientific analyses evaluation research you know where you felt that you could not separate women from their communities from their households that any development had to take place within that context As a result many efforts that had been undertaken were really you know wasted in terms of for example income generation Many of the projects did not generate income The effort now is one of mainstreaming women's concerns in other words insuring that the mainstream addresses gender concerns in development The mainstream is government The mainstream is NGO So rather than looking at women's problems piecemeal what we would like to see is for each government sector whether it's information is that you tackle the needs of women in information It's not for NGO NGOs can only reinforce what the ministry does but the ministry has to sit down and really brainstorm on how to reach women So you got to find alternative ways of reaching out to those women So what we recommend for example to the Ministry of Information is to adopt a multi-strategy for reaching women within <O/> communication and so forth Otherwise they'll be missing out and they'll continue to miss out on important things that are happening in our country The same challenge goes to the Minister of Agriculture Let us not confine women's participation in agriculture to the home science division home economics division in the Ministry because women are involved in all aspects of agriculture and food production and that when an extension officer goes out in the rural areas this is the farmer that he or she is looking for\n<$B> One of the ongoing activities of FEMNET is gender sensitisation This is done through seminars where various gender roles are analysed in order to integrate them fully in future development\n<$A> We have worked with planning officers We have worked with researchers We have worked with the development uh uh extension officers and you know having gone through this system of analysing gender roles what men do what women do and trying to strengthen them within these roles and trying to help them to change some of the social attitudes towards certain roles and so forth you certainly create a more just society You know gender sensitisation is all about rewrite democratisation is all about social justice you know really making sure that everybody has opportunities and that you know there is co-operation within the society Information dissemination is our one of our crucial uh roles that as an organisation we try to share information that may not be available to the ordinary woman and we ask NGOs to take this information and use it in the way they want it and translate it into local languages They can rewrite those articles that are more relevant to you know groups and women in their own countries uh uh and so and so forth This is the kind of thing we have been trying to do We have tried in this process We've also tried to establish a documentation centre because women you know information on women is scattered all over the place You find more publications on women in Europe and America you know rather than in Africa So what we are trying to do is put together packages of information that's important on women's health on women's education women in decision-making and so on and so forth\n<$B> Doctor Edda Chachukia Chairperson of FEMNET the African Women Development and Communication Network and this is a networking of NGOs that are

{'text': "<$A> This is Point of Interest a <ea_>Biblia Husema<ea/> programme for Kenya Broadcasting Corporation Nairobi This is your Christian magazine programme that brings you issues views and interviews I am Pastor Simon Mohota Welcome Our point of interest today is about why man needs salvation why man needs salvation But before we get to that good point we have music here by the Urbanines from Nairobi In The Fullness of Time That is our own The Urbanines from Nairobi with their number In the Fullness of Time Yes our people are coming up We praise the Lord for them that they're singing for the Lord with such good voices May God bless you The Urbanines from Nairobi Let's ask ourselves this question why do man need salvation Why do man need salvation Have you ever thought why you are or what you are by nature You know that there are people who look very innocent don't you I agree that probably you out there you're very innocent You never steal You never kill You never lie and before people when people judge you they give you eighty-five per cent or ninety-five per cent because after all no-one is perfect only Christ as man was perfect But have you ever thought what you are before God or what you are by nature Our point of interest today is about why man needs salvation Man needs salvation simply because man is a sinner Salvation simply means to accept the Lord Jesus Christ as our personal saviour And maybe you are saying Come off it Pastor I am not so bad But you know to me you look good because I cannot see you beyond your face or body But God has x-rayed the human heart and has given us the picture He shows us what he finds in us all The findings are so terrible they cannot be read in a mixed audience But remember this is a picture of us that God sees I know your picture is there because it says There is none that does good no not one Have you heard of someone who has been to hospital He had pains probably in the stomach or chest pains Then the doctor orders an x-ray to be taken And when it's taken the doctor reads the x-ray and finds that you have a stomach cancer or biopsy shows surely you have it You see the patient may say I don't have it or maybe it is a different disease But his doubts will not change the fact that he or she has cancer There was an old man who was told that he has Aids after the blood-test When he was told he said Does Aids come with wind His objection did not change anything He still remained an Aids-patient When you read the Book of Romans you find in the first three chapters the picture of man without God In Romans chapter three you will believe then that the natural heart is desperately wicked Let me ask you a question Have you asked the Holy Spirit to throw such light on your own heart If you have you know today that you will need a saviour God in the Book of Romans presents a court-room scene God the judge of all the earth summons Jews and Gentiles before the Bar of Justice Prisoner after prisoner is brought up The general charge is stated All under is sin Both the Gentiles and Jews are given the opportunity for hearing Their special pleas of not-guilty are carefully considered and answered clearing the way for the final verdict from the judge Finally the judge pronounces the verdict All the world guilty before God If this were today newspapers every word would blaze this headline all the television newsmen would be announcing it Can't you hear them All the world found guilty Against all this there is no defence The judge says Is there anyone to plea the cause of the prisoner and there is no answering voice Every mouth is stopped There is no room for excuse The condemnation of the world is settled But praise the Lord that is not the end of the matter The same God reveals the plan of salvation to save a lost world At this juncture just because God is revealing his plan to save the lost world don't say After all God is love he will not condemn me Listen to God's word The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness Remember he has already passed sentence on everyone All guilty There is no chance of appeal It is a decision of the Supreme Court of the universe because sin is universal all have sinned Hence we need a world's saviour And because God is good and he's a God of love he has provided just this one the saviour of the world Read with me John Chapter three verse sixteen \nThe judge on the bench says Is there anyone to appear for the prisoners Then the son of man the son of God says Yes I'm here to represent these men and women It is true they have committed these sins It is true that they are guilty But I bore their guilt on the cross I died in their place that they might go free I'm their righteousness and the judge sets them free\nPraise the Lord brothers and sisters Christ not only saves us from the penalty of sin but he is able to free us from the consciousness of guilt and the power of sin Next week we'll talk about how to become a Christian or how to be born again Till then God bless you \nThank you The Urbanines from Nairobi with their number In the Fullness of Time Yes we have come to the end of our programme Point of Interest Remember that words from that song that the love of God is deep and wide Yes he has come to save us May we accept him as our personal saviour This has been Pastor Simon Mohota saying God bless you Bye\n\n<$A> This is Point of Interest a <ea_>Biblia Husema<ea/> studio's programme for Kenya Broadcasting Corporation Nairobi This is your Christian magazine programme that brings you issues views and interviews I am Pastor Simon Mohota your presenter welcome Today in point of interest we are discussing how to become a Christian or in other words how to be born again but before that let's get good music Yes that was Randy Stonehill with the number Even the Best of Friends Last week we talked about what we are by nature and the conclusion was that man and of course woman is a sinner who has been proven guilty and has pleaded guilty We saw that what awaits man is death because the wages of sin is death The judge on the bench says Is there anyone to appear for these prisoners Then the Son of God says Yes I'm here to represent these men and women It is true that they committed these sins It is true that they are guilty but I bore their guilt on the cross I died in their place that they might go free So how does God save sinners or how can one become a believer or a Christian born again The answer is through redemption in Christ Jesus When God looks at us he sees no righteousness but when he looks at us in Christ he does not see any *inprovent> but perfection He does not see an improvement but perfection For God sees only his own righteousness Jesus Christ Praise the Lord that a sinful man like me a sinner by nature who cannot have his own righteousness is made righteous I can't help but say Praise be to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ who made this possible How to be a Christian or to be born again is to realise that first though you don't do many terrible things that men can term a sin like adultery bribery murdering cheating or any other form of corruption you are a sinner by nature Your heart mind and soul without Christ is always hostile to the things of God Man is always in rebellion against God Because of that man has been alienated from God and no matter what man does he cannot fellowship with God his maker And that is without Christ Secondly you have to know or realise that you cannot bridge or bridge the gap and you cannot save yourself You need Christ When Christ died on the cross he said It is finished That means through Christ by faith we can now talk to God our Father unlike in the Old Testament when men had to go through a priest Today we are privileged to have a great high priest who did not take a lamb from us but he himself was the lamb for us Remember the word of John or the words of John the Baptist when he saw Jesus coming He said in John Chapter one verse twenty-nine <quote_><quote/> In First John chapter one verse nine the Bible says <quote_><quote/> And in Relevation Chapter three verse twenty Jesus says <quote_><quote/> Remember brother and sister the handle to open the door is on your side It all depends on you whether you'll open the door or not Jesus will not bulldoze you to accept him Jesus is a gentleman He wants you to decide by your own He cannot force you or he cannot face force his way in or use force He's able to do that and he can use any means to bring you to your knees but Jesus is humble and patient He is waiting for you patiently to open the door for him so that he will come into your hut and be your friend and helper He also wants you to know that through him because of your faith in him you are regarded as if you never sinned That is in theological terms you are justified Everything that Christ has done has been credited to your account His righteousness is is yours When Christ's righteousness is reckoned as ours this is called justification A man made just righteous before God The just shall live by faith the Bible says A man is not made just by his works but by believing on Christ Today we have what I may term traditional Christianity Somebody thinks because my parents are Christians or they're church elders deacons or Mothers Union or Guild or many other positions in the church or maybe you sing in the choir you teach Sunday school or any other work you say then surely I'm a Christian My friend these are all good works but

{'text': "<$A> Besides the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> artisan can even go further and use recycled material like making the wheelbarrow base with a metal sheet from a huge drum Precision products like weighing-machines have always been the domain of high-tech industries Not any more The <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> entrepreneurs have mastered the art Just like they can <O/> by <O/> as Mr <name/> explained to us \nThe <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> enjoy another advantage They are able to cut a lot of unnecessary overheads BET Chairman Dr <name/> took a moment to explain why they deserve to be supported \n<$B> We believe that <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> are promoting the informal sector through this exhibition They do not only make their own noble contribution but also complement and supplement its efforts in achieving the prime objective for industrialisation by localisation and with creating a climate of security in this country\n<$A> High quality shiny and strong kareems from a <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> foundry There are the high level technology that was also exhibited by a welding machine which has been completely manufactured by a <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> artisan The abilities of the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> could be seen in these two lorries of the same age one of which has been reconditioned by a <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> garage with great results Apart from repairs which is their home task the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> can be very inventive Big trailers some of which you see on our roads are not from the big multi-national trailer-makers only Some have completely been manufactured by the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> artisans This is a living example These bicycles and tricycles work even though the frames are square and maybe too heavy But a bicycle like this one has some advantages The tyres are definitely puncture proof With some adaptation and borrowing of technology some of the bicycles are quite acceptable and definitely attractive to buy because the price tag was half of what it would cost if it originated from one of the big industries\n<$C> I find that a <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> clock <O/> my clock are equivalent to one minute of the normal watches or the normal clocks\n<$A> A clock which works by using a drop-of-water technique and its carried water container some tin and some little <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> magic and presso you have the clock\nThen there was the home-made organ instrument With some improvement this could definitely help those children studying music in the eight-four-four system \n<$D> ... this particular tool here is a home-made piano as I call it I designed and created it all myself I programmed it in a way that's then it can be used like any other uh key-board instrument \n<$A> The works of <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> <name/> looks a bit crude but it can work It was made by a standard A pupil who could not demonstrate it to us because he had gone to sit his standard A examinations Obviously these innovations need some improvement and there would be wider issues like marketability and standardisation to be dealt with Those are some of the matters being discussed at the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> symposium which brought together the artisans and specialists from various disciplines to deliberate the matters affecting this important sector All over the world at the Ivory Towers like the World Bank Offices in New York and other capitals of the world there are volumes of books research papers and recommendations for improving the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> sector or the informal sector But all the intellectual material has on most occasions been simply overtaken by the spontaneous vitality of this sector The <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> sector vibrates in harmony with its atmosphere It quickly adjusts to new situations in a given market place In Kenya it is fast taking its place in our industrial sector Look at this wood quality furniture Good enough to furnish the office of a minister And indeed Minister Professor <name/>'s office is <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> furnished So when Professor <name/> says he supports the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> sector he is practical about it too He had some good remarks on <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> sector \nWe also talked to a <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> practitioner This time a lady Margaret <name/> the former secretary who now welds and makes this type of furniture and she spoke for other <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> people on the value of this exhibition\n<$E> Especially for this exhibition I find it works It is also giving us courage uh and it has also given us contact because since I came I've been contacted by several people They've also placed some orders especially for desk repairs for schools and some offices I find it a benefit if there was more exhibition of the kind to be held\n<$A> Margaret proudly displays to us her version of a sofa bed This sofa bed worked so well and effectively that the only bad thing about it was that it is not copy-righted Does she have any regrets for having left the secretarial desk and stepped out into the span of the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> sector Not at all\n<$E> I prefer now the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> because I control myself and then if I don't get anything for the day I don't mind I call it a day But when I can I get a lot more \n<$A> You think you get more money of the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> than you can get as a secretary \n<$E> I suppose so Although it comes at times not all but it is better than being a secretary \n<$A> What is the main problem in this business\n<$E> The main problem is market Marketing your uh items \n<$A> The excellence of the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> sector in making bags and shoes was another impressive feature The bags and the ladies' shoes were as cute as those imported from Taiwan and probably stronger than the versions from those far-Eastern countries As for the shoes there was no doubt that they are strong and practical for those who wish to buy shoes only once in a while and that is the majority of us When one realises that even a multi-national shoe company like Bata does it all from one small family shop in a village in Europe for this keen old man the sky could also be the limit for his shoe enterprise President Moi had compliments for the organisers of the exhibition which helped in efforts to put to the core the importance of this informal sector \n<$F> Exhibitions of this measure require a substantial amount of resources both financial and human I am therefore glad that like the previous events <O/> BET has once again offered to meet a substantial extent of the costs of this exhibition This is a practical demonstration of the spirit of <ea/>harambee and a good example of the willingness of the private sector to join hands with government in developing our economy What we are witnessing today would not have been possible without your moral technical and financial support Thank you very much \n<$A> The exhibition was also a tribute to these hard-working men and women those who often literally sweat under the heat of the sun to make an honest living and yet even as they make high-quality items like this bed there still face the problem of marketing Piles and piles of their products not getting sold All the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> entrepreneurs we talked to have the problem of marketing For instance they display the clothes out in the open where there is a problem of sun and dust probably discolouring the fabrics Then they compete with products that come from the big industries However the victory of the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> all the carpenters tailors metal fabricators and the rest is that they are still competing surviving and slowly but steadily winning Hundreds of women win their livelihood by tailoring <Name/>'s dressmaking shop is one of them Many Kenyans in several fields of life have had some good education thanks to school fees paid by parents whose only trade is tailoring The head of the <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> section in the Ministry of Technical Training and Applied Technology Mr <name/> was certainly encouraged by the exhibition\n<$G> I'd say I'm quite satisfied with uh the show Firstly because no doubt we achieved our objectives \n<$A> What were your objectives \n<$G> We had set some objectives for this show One is to uh market these <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> products who are in want of marketing and also need some promotion of their products We also intended to bring <ea_>Jua Kalis<ea/> from different areas of the country so that they can exchange their experiences and ideas and learn from each other From what we have already observed we are satisfied that it was a worthwhile exercise \n<$A> The creativity of the sector was displayed in such peculiar trades like this one of making rings bracelets and hairpieces from cow horns This foreign exchange earnings from this cow horn enterprise \n<$H> This is uh a hairclip This is made of uh from cow horn Now we have them in different kind of designs We have that shape and then we have another shape which is uh we call it uh heart shape uh that one where you just pull it up and put up the hair knot it up some and then put it up there and then all you have to do is knot it up with a pin \n<$A> There is also foreign exchange earnings and a lot of livelihoods dependent on thisindustry The women's craft is really a <ea_>Jua Kali<ea/> sector even though they often work under the shelter of their homes", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source':

{'text': "<$A> In this case the preparation can be done financially by saving and keeping aside a little money every month to make it easy to buy whatever will be necessary when the baby comes\n<$B> The essential items can be divided into four groups namely the layette or baby's cloth and articles bathing items and toilet accessories sleeping place or cot and feeding equipment It is worthwhile remembering that these essential items must be suitable for a young baby and should be selected carefully Let us now discuss each group at a time\n<$A> The layette means articles of clothing needed by the baby These should be made or bought by the mother When selecting articles of clothing these points should be observed One the material used should be soft warm washable long lasting absorbent and light in weight Two the style used for garments should be simple and should allow for easy putting on and taking off of the garment Choose attractive styles Three the garments should have suitable opening for easy wearing They should be loosely fitting with wide hems to allow for growth Four the fasteners selected should not be hard such as zips and big buttons use tapes press-studs elastic and tiny buttons which do not press hard on baby's skin Five the material should have small design and should be of good fast colour to suit the small baby and six the articles made or bought should be adequate because the baby has to be changed to clean clothes often during the day Can you tell us what is included in the layette\n<$B> Yes these articles include napkins These can be made of muslin towelling or disposable materials You should have at least twenty-four of these napkins or more for cold weather The baby should be changed as soon as he is wet to prevent skin rashes and bad smell You also need three to four vests both cross-over style or ordinary but suitable in size and petticoats for girls Sweaters three to four including cardigans Three to four matinee coats to be worn on top of vests or dresses Three to four pairs of booties These are used to keep baby's feet warm Outer garments dresses shirts rompers tunics suits and others This should be adequate for daily wear and changing when necessary Bibs to be used when feeding the baby Buy two to three of these Plastic pants Cap or bonnet to cover the head when it is cold Mittens or gloves two pairs to be used when it is cold Two to three baby shawls and safety pins for fastening of napkins about half a dozen\n<$A> Let's now consider the bathing items and toilet accessories As you know the baby must be given a bath daily to keep her or him cool and clean You need to buy the following items in advance A basin or <ea/><O/> a plastic basin is better than <ea/><O/> because it is easy to keep clean and does not rust It is used to hold water for the bath You should also buy a bucket or large <ea/>sufuria for putting in water A bucket with a lid for putting in soiled clothes These should be soaked and washed well immediately Soft towel for drying the body of the baby A baby soap and buy one which can be afforded Baby oil lotion or jelly to apply on the skin As for the baby powder buy one of good quality and use it on the under-arm and between legs to dry off the moisture after bath Cotton wool and buds Use these when cleaning baby's ears nose and eyes A small bowl or cup of warm or cold boiled water for bathing the face of the young baby especially the eyes Dettol to use in the washing water to guard against infection A hairbrush and a comb Baby's potty or chamber to train the baby in the good habit of emptying his bowels in a clean manner This can be made of plastic enamel or aluminium and lastly a nail cutter or small scissors to trim the baby's nails \n<$B> Let us now discuss the sleeping place for the baby It is important that the baby has enough sleep in a quiet warm and well ventilated room At early stages the baby will sleep most of the time He must have a comfortable place to sleep in Some mothers prefer sleeping with the baby but if possible the baby should have his or her own cot which is comfortable and safe to sleep in without the danger of falling There are different types of cots in the market and one should buy what one can afford The cot should be firm comfortable durable and of the correct size Examples of cots are basket wooden canvas metal and pram cots What are the items needed for the cot\n<$A> You need to have a firm soft mattress to fit the cot Cot blankets and sheets should also be made available A mackintosh should be bought to prevent the baby wetting the sheets and the blankets This can be made of rubber or plastic The cot should have a mosquito net to cover the baby so that the insects do not disturb him or her when asleep A bed-cover can also be made available to make the cot look neat and attractive\n<$B> Finally let us discuss feeding equipment For a young baby one needs few items because one should breastfeed the baby as much as possible However there are times when you have to feed the baby with soup porridge fruit juice water and other suitable foods for his or her age The following items should be made available A cup and a spoon Buy suitable size A small bowl or a plate thermoflask to keep water hot a large plastic bowl or <ea/>sufuria with a lid for storing and sterilising items in A measuring cup or jug a small <ea/>sufuria for boiling water or milk All these items should be selected carefully Buy good quality items which are easy to keep clean Clean them well and sterilise them by using Milton solution or boiling those ones which are made of unbreakable materials Is there any special point to remember on the items I've just mentioned\n<$A> Yes I'd like to add that all baby's items should be kept clean and fresh all the time Clothes sheets and towels must be washed often dried in the sun and ironed Towels and vests can be boiled occasionally to kill germs or parasites Napkins should be bleached to keep them white\n<$B> Let us now summarise our lesson We have discussed the necessary preparation an expectant mother needs to do before the baby is born Remember these points One make or buy baby's garment and articles early enough to avoid rush at the last minute Two make sure that bathing and feeding items are also bought Three if the baby is to be born at the hospital make sure that you have hospital fees Four make sure that you know who will look after the family when you are at the hospital Five prepare the members of the family for the new baby and six if you have to give birth at home make sure that you have all the necessary items and a qualified person to help you when delivering\n<$A> And that is all for today teachers <$A> This programme was written by Daina Megunda and edited and produced by Luis Kimani Your presenters were \n<$B> Geroke Mahora\n<$A> and Elizabeth Gatumia Our technical operator was Evanson Kahothia This has been an Education on Media Service Production of the Kenya Institute of Education And until next time good bye \n\n<$A> The English service presents Viewpoint a programme that focuses on issues and contradictions arising from sciences experiences ideas and matters of particular or general interest Our speaker today is Professor Joseph Njasani Principal of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences and Professor of Philosophy University of Nairobi\n<$B> Today I would like to speak to you about a very very perennial and living issue in philosophy known as the problem of mind and body And when we speak of mind a lot of philosophers have devoted a lot of time trying to see to understand to discern the meaning of mind A philosopher like H D Lewis has written a book known as the elusive mind and is trying to elaborate to expose the intricate problem of the relationship between mind and body History of philosophy I can say that no issue has been debated so uncompromisingly as the question of mind and therefore by implication consciousness There does seem to be justifiable grounds for this uncompromising debate One the mind is such an elusive thing in that we are completely unable to say with certainty where precisely it is located in the human body All the classical theories on mind like those of Plato and Aristotle that locate the soul either in the heart or in the brain and even the Cartesian or Descartes' theory of the pineal gland as the seat of the mind have been accepted with a lot of scepticism in modern contemporary philosophical speculations For the human soul is probably neither located in the pineal gland nor in the heart as Aristotle thought It is probably everywhere in the human organism in the same intensity and in the same assertiveness on the level of consciousness Of course some parts of the body may appear to be more vulnerable or less vulnerable in the preservation or loss of consciousness That not with the standing it should not mean that the soul is at least or more distributed in those parts or shall I say it should not mean that the soul is less or more distributed in those parts For vulnerability or even the organ that seemingly contains the vulnerable substance are two separate things The container of the substance only happens to be crucial to the maintenance or disturbance of the equilibrium but it cannot be the equilibrium itself We know that upon a total damage of the brain or a total shattering of the heart the soul departs or vanishes It does so not in bits and pieces but as a total principal life now withdrawn This in itself seems to suggest that the soul as a substance is indivisible and evenly distributed throughout the body Were that not to be the case then it should at least be the case that death would be a very gradual and unending process that stretches out in the life span of the physical disintegration of the millions of atoms in the human body Indeed death would be in piecemeal It would probably mean that once the head is fatally ruptured the rest of the body would continue to live Instead that is not the case For once the fatal blow has been delivered the soul departs at once and as a totality However it may be asked and this is the question I'm going to address myself in our coming uh episode Why does man and the soul by implication continue to subsist or to survive even after dismembering a person\n<$A> You have been

{'text': "<$A> Hello and welcome to yet another edition of Your Security in Old Age brought to you by National Social Security Fund in conjunction with the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation Last week in Your Security in Old Age we answered some of the questions we have been receiving from members of the Fund Tonight we shall start off by reminding members and the public in general about the historical development of the fund its objectives policies and operations among its members But before that here is a message from the sponsors \n<$B> Do you know that it's against the law to have employees who are not registered as members of the National Social Security Fund Do you also know that it's against the law not to remit or delay members' contributions Make sure that you remit your employees' contributions in time National Social Security Fund Your security in old age <$A> It did not take long after independence for Kenyans in various spheres of leadership including the government parliament and trade union movements to realise that the majority of Kenyan workers did not have anything to look forward to on retirement Workers employed by the private sector had not formally recognised social schemes to cater for their social protection Therefore necessary steps were taken and the NSSF was established in nineteen sixty-five by an Act of Parliament Initially the NSSF operated as a department of the Ministry of Labour However by the nineteen eighties it had become a fairly complex organisation and in nineteen eighty-eight was transformed into a state corporation The fund's policy is formulated by the Board of Trustees The Board of Trustees comprises of workers' representatives from Kotu employers' representatives from the Federation of Kenyan Employers that is FKE and government representatives In formulating the fund's policies the Board of Trustees acts strictly in accordance with the NSSF Act The Board delegates the day-to-day management of the fund to the managing trustee who also serves as the chief executive of the NSSF In managing the affairs of the fund the managing trustee places the best interest of the members above all other considerations Membership to the fund is compulsory through your employer Every employer is required to register himself and his employees Employers with at least five employees on their payroll are required to submit monthly contributions to the fund Any employer who fails to register with the fund or fails to register their workers within twenty-one days after employment is guilty of an offence and liable for prosecution in a court of law The fund has a team of inspectors stationed in different parts of the country who ensure that employers comply with the provisions of the NSSF Act But before we continue the programme let us take a short break with the number I need you by BVSMP A number of you have written to us wondering what happens to your membership when you change employment You can only be registered once as a member of the fund during your working life Your membership number is your account number which you must quote in all correspondence or inquiries regarding your statement of account Your membership number remains the same even when you change employers In case you lose your job or become self-employed you remain a member of the fund even when no contributions are forthcoming to your account What's more your early savings continue to earn interests until you qualify to withdraw your benefits An employee is automatically exempted from the fund membership if he or she is working for either the government or the local authorities and is under pensionable terms or if he or she is working for an employer like a parastatal offering pension benefits under any scheme approved by the Minister for Labour in writing Others who are exempted from the fund membership are the armed forces the prison service administration police or national aid service Also an employer who qualifies for exemption under international conventions the public universities where your pension is covered by the super-annuation scheme or if you're undergoing full-time instruction in school college university and so on and you happen to be on vacation employment any payment in the form of allowances shall not be construed to be a wage Before we wind up tonight's programme we have a letter from <name/> Abulala of PO Box four one six <name/> He tells us that he is a keen listener of both our English and Swahili radio programmes Abulala says he was working with a certain employer between nineteen eighty-four to nineteen ninety During this period he was receiving dockets but since then he has not received anything to that effect He is therefore asking for a statement showing his contributions Well Mr Abulala we're pleased to know that you are a keen listener of our radio programmes We urge other members to tune in on Tuesdays at eight forty-five p m for the Swahili programme <name/> NSSF and Friday at eight forty-five p m for the English programme Your Security in Old Age We assure you that you'll find both programmes very educative We would also like to inform our dear listeners that NSSF stopped issuing dockets What we issue now are statements and on request Mr Abulala your statement of account will soon be dispatched to you In case of any errors or omissions we'll be glad to offer further assistance <$B> Do you know that it's against the law to have employees who are not registered as members of the National Social Security Fund Do you also know that it's against the law not to remit or delay members' contributions Make sure that you remit your employees' contributions in time National Social Security Fund Your security in Old Age <$A> And with that listeners we've come to the end of this week's edition of Your Security in Old Age In case of any questions please write to us on PO Box seven zero four six zero Nairobi PO Box seven zero four six zero Nairobi This programme is brought to you by the National Social Security Fund in conjunction with the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation And until next week and on behalf of our producer <name/> this is your presenter <name/> saying goodbye \n\n<$A> that it could be that research has shown that seventy per cent of migraine sufferers do not currently consult their doctors The survey also showed that among these fifty-three per cent of them are zero *consulters> that is they have given up hope on consulting doctors so these are quiet sufferers A possible consequence of this is that doctors may be unaware of the full extent of the problem Another difficulty could be sufferers seldom or rarely consult their doctors when a migraine is actually in progress Doctors therefore have to interview sufferers about past events which they may not recall completely or accurately The other one could be or is there is no laboratory test for migraine and few effective diagnostic tools apart from <O/> taking are currently available And again migraine is not always easy to distinguish from other forms of headache With all those problems or difficulties facing the doctors notwithstanding therefore there have been a number of treatments that have been used for long time for many years and currently they are divided into two types The first class is only to treat the acute phase of the migraine attack and these drugs are given specifically to abort an attack or reduce the symptoms of the attack And the other class of drugs is a prophylactic or the preventive medication which is given specifically to prevent or to reduce the frequency of the attack We would like all listeners or those people who have this problem to consult their doctors on the specific medication they may be given because the medication as we've already said in this programme will depend or will vary according to the severity of the condition the condition itself and the type of patient or the patient himself So we won't mention the drugs that are given here suffice it to say that these drugs are given for two main reasons One is to abort an impending attack or reduce the symptoms of attack which is existing and the other type of drug is to prevent an attack or to reduce the frequency of attacks A vast area of different approaches not all pharmacological are used for the treatment of migraine However as none-drug therapies are unlikely to provide sufficient relief for many patients most are compelled to seek pharmacological or medical solutions As preventive drug treatment is reserved for those suffering frequent or severe migraine attacks and the risk of breakthrough attacks is quite high optimisation of acute treatment is of paramount importance However the wide variation in the approach of acute migraine treatment the differing modes of action of the drugs used and the problem of side effects reflect the lack of a completely satisfactory therapy This highlights the need for an effective acute migraine treatment that has as a good side effect profile and a well-defined mechanism of action of migraine Now what are the causative factors of migraine No one knows why some individuals have migraines and others do not Certain factors are implicated in the answer to migraine however First group of factors are the predisposing ones or the predisposing factors Research has shown migraine to be a commoner or to be commoner in women than in men by a factor of about three to one The role of female productive hormones may explain this difference Secondly individuals with a family history of migraine are more likely to have migraines than those without So there could be *genetical> components in this aspect The other factors are ones we call the *precepitory> factors Evidence from both patients and doctors suggest that a wide variety of stresses can trigger migraine These could include strong emotions physical exertion changes in temperature for example when taking a hot bath intense sensual stimulation or *stimulizers> such as bright or flickering light loud noises and unpleasant smells food and drink This could vary from cheese chocolates some fruits and some wines They have frequently been implicated and female productive hormone fluctuations such as those associated with menstruation or taking of contraceptives and changes in the weather especially from dry to humid conditions Little clinical evidence has been obtained to establish firmly any of the above <O/> factors but this may reflect difficulties in research rather than in validity in the claims made There is also difficulty in distinguishing causes from effects For example we try to ascertain whether consumption of certain foods or drinks before migraine is responsible for triggering the migraine or there's a sort of a craving which is the onset Now how is or how can migraine be prevented The limited knowledge about the causes of migraine makes prevention a fairly difficult subject Nevertheless there're three main avenues that could be used or have been used with some success One is lifestyle changes that even though little is certain about precipitating factors most headache specialists work with their patients to try to identify and then if possible eliminate factors that can trigger attacks Successes are reported for example through eliminating particular foods or drinks from the diet and by reducing stress at home and at work Other complimentary techniques that may be used in prevention of migraine could be some taking some form of foods other conditions <O/> like homeopathy Others could be acupuncture which has claimed to be effective in some cases and some techniques that seek relaxation such as yoga massage meditation and bare feet bath can also be effective by reducing neck and other tension which could be a precipitating factor for migraine Again there is little scientific evidence to support the efficacy of these techniques It is important therefore that headache and migraine sufferers consult their doctors as medical research is now offering effective new medicines now currently available to combat this affliction *Migrainers> now need not suffer quietly as there is hope for the future Do consult your doctor", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL',

{'text': "<$A> This is your weekly programme that takes a critical look at the world of books and their authors In this week's edition of the programme we focus on the late Eugene Ionesco of the Theatre of the Absurd Many Kenyans especially those who never studied literature at university level might never have heard of Eugene Ionesco Indeed ours is a society that has no reading culture and therefore very few writers are well known But  for> those who studied drama at university level and got interested in the Theatre of the Absurd do know Eugene Ionesco This is one writer whose ideas and dramatic experiments have continued to influence many writers and critics alive Eugene Ionesco who died early April at the age of eighty-five is perhaps one of the greatest writers within the absurd tradition This school of thought is associated with among others Samuel Beckett Arthur Adamov Jean Genet and Eugene Ionesco himself Whereas many people believe that the Theatre of the Absurd is elitist and confined to the narrow circle of intellectuals it however provides new ideas new approaches and a new vitalised philosophy which is aimed at transforming our modes of thought It is therefore necessary to see the Theatre of the Absurd as one genre that has eluded both the critics and readers alike While looking at the Theatre of the Absurd which Eugene Ionesco subscribed to it is notable that the presentation of the drama in this tradition is to some degree technically isolating in terms of language and style Isolating in the sense that very few people especially those schooled in the art of appreciating drama in its finest form do appreciate it By saying so we are not implying that traditional drama is by any chance inferior However good art communicates in images and symbols and that is what absurd drama does Incidentally only those well-schooled in the art of appreciating good drama respond positively to the Theatre of the Absurd We stand to be challenged Nevertheless with absurd drama the audience is presented with unconventional approach a complete departure from the norms It is common knowledge that people rarely welcome new ideas with both hands and this is what happened to the Theatre of the Absurd In nineteen-fifty for instance when Eugene Ionesco's play entitled The Bald Soprano opened in Paris there was no kind word for it Eugene's other play entitled The Lessons concluded after one night with the late actor bolting out ahead of spectators who were demanding for their money This was how serious it was for an audience to be presented with something extraordinary and incomprehensible However the audience slowly began to appreciate the Theatre of the Absurd and by nineteen-seventy the Roman-born Ionesco was elected to the pantheon of tradition in his society In fact his death early in April was announced by the Ministry of Culture in France and not by his wife Rodeka whom he stayed with for fifty-eight years Eugene Ionesco's drama presented the audience with completely different dramatic experiences Critics criticised them for lack of plot development characterisation suspense or plain common sense The absurd plays are normally dismissed as nonsense or mystifications Even in Kenya today absurd drama has really not been appreciated A good example of a play written in this tradition which is perhaps one of the greatest plays to have come from Kenya is Francis Mbuga's Game of Silence Despite being technically richer than other plays by the same author critics have not given it critical attention One fact that is true however is that plays written in this new convention when judged by the standards and criteria of traditional drama may be regarded as impertinent and outrageous That is if a good play should be judged by <O/> of characterisation and motivation These plays are however without recognisable characters and present the audience with almost mechanical puppets In the same vein they do not have fully explained theme which is neatly exposed and finally solved The absurd plays neither have a beginning nor an end traditionally speaking The absurd plays do not hold the mirror up to nature and portray manners and behaviour of the age in finely observed sketches Rather one finds reflections or dreams and nightmares In the absurd plays one does not find witty repertoire and pointed dialogue but more often one will encounter incoherent babblings Eugene Ionesco was therefore a representative of this school of thought He even described himself as part of the Paris School that included Samuel Beckett and Jean Genet However Ionesco's plays tended to be funnier and more viable than Beckett's He also used ritual and repetition for joking rather than the psychological revelations sought by Genet Theatre of the Absurd however deviates from conventional theatre because it uses different methods Its standards can only be judged by the standards of the Theatre of the Absurd It is however necessary to note that each writer of the absurd has his own personal approach to both the subject matter and form his own routes sources and background For Eugene Ionesco whose family was shuttled between his mother's France and his father's Rumania his drama is informed by this situation While a college student the young Ionesco broke with his father who was successively a Fascist and a Stalinist on political grounds Long afterwards he wondered whether he had been harsh to his father The adult Ionesco often described himself as an anarchist and objected to dissenters as much as those in power terming the opposition merely a state in the making Among the ironies in his career was that Americans who gave his play entitled Rhinoceros its warmest reception misunderstood it as a light comedy To Ionesco a city where everyone but the hero turns into a rhinoceros was a brutal metaphor In a journal note dated around nineteen-forty two decades before the play he wrote and we quote <quote_><quote/> End of quote While the above was purely Ionesco's view of the world in the absurd tradition the Theatre of the Absurd can be seen as the reflection of what seems to be a genuine representation of our time Other writers in the tradition like Albert Camus were basically concerned with the question why In his book entitled Myth of Sisyphus Camus tried to diagonalise the human situation in a world of shattered beliefs Camus wrote and we quote <quote_><quote/> End of quote But for Eugene Ionesco absurd is that which is devoid of pathos He observed and we quote <quote_><quote/> end of quote Definitely the passing away of Eugene Ionesco is a loss for those in the literary profession and especially for the lovers of absurd dramaAnd on that note listener we come to the end of this week's edition of the programme Books and Bookmen in which we focused on the works and life of the late Eugene Ionesco of the Theatre of the Absurd who died early this year in April And on behalf of the programme producer George Okore this is your presenter as usual <name/> saying good bye \n\n<$A> however the cases and complications do occur which make the birth process risky and unsafe for both mother and child Every day more than one thousand women die from problems related to childbearing A Healthy Nation this week looks at various methods of reducing this death and prevent related illnesses Welcome\n<$B> The birth of a new child to a family brings untold joy which often calls for celebration For many couples a child cements an otherwise complex relationship In the child is seen the chance to gain immortality to be remembered long after one has died To prepare for a safe delivery an expectant mother should make regular visits to maternal health clinic The first visit should be made immediately he realises she is pregnant She should also go for medical check-up if she finds she is bleeding gets premature labour or urinary infection A Healthy Nation visited some hospitals and health centres in South Nyanza and recorded activities at maternal clinics Health workers in MCH clinics are trained to carry out their commissions and give appropriate counsel to mothers Here a community nurse trainer takes the mother's blood pressure High blood pressure would be a danger to both mother and child Next to be taken is her haemoglobin level One of the most common problems during pregnancy is anaemia which can be corrected easily if detected early enough An expectant mother should also be tested for sugar and protein levels in her blood Health Workers will then establish if she has a history of diabetes The weight and height of the mother are also recorded This service is provided free in maternal and child health clinics all over the country A physical examination is carried out to establish her ability to carry the pregnancy to full term and manage a safe delivery For this to be done she has to lie on the examination couch where palpitation of the abdomen is conducted This helps establish if the foetus is lying in a safe and normal position A pregnant mother undergoes changes which make it crucial for her to have regular check-ups Doctor <name/> in <name/> hospital outlined some of the changes\n<$C> First before she becomes pregnant the body has to be prepared for that uh pregnancy The uterus the inlines inside lining of the uterus thickens and evokes more glands more blood vessels more lymphatics These will be ready to receive the fertilised ovum and nourish it for the nine month that it will take inside the uterus During this time the blood circulation in the lady has to increase The heart has to increase its work The food that is eaten has to be for the two That's the mother as well as the uh expected baby For this reason we have to be very careful what we food we eat uh and how we treat this pregnant mother The body has also to be prepared to carry this pregnancy through the nine months For this reason you find that in some cases if there are some diseases which are hidden they tend to come out because that is stress to the body and uh for this reason we have to take care and be sure that should there be any of these diseases we should take care of them and control them as the mother goes through pregnancy Uh psychologically the mother will also be affected because she is expecting the baby perhaps the first baby She has never gone through all the stages particularly the stage of bearing the baby that labour pains So these changes have to be prepared for\n<$B> Before leaving the clinic the mother is advised on what to do to be ready for the delivery She should rest enough beside getting enough sleep Strenuous work should be avoided especially over the last three months She should eat a balanced diet She should also avoid smoking Drug should only be taken with a doctor's prescription Alcohol would be detrimental to the foetus' growth and is often the cause of low birth-weight Mothers with a history of difficult deliveries need special care So do mothers with <name/> disease or heart conditions A look at a typical delivery room shows some of the facilities that would be used for such mothers especially in case of complication\n<$D> This one we use for listening to the foetal hearts before the mothers delivers A mother might deliver a baby which has what we call foetal distress and unable to breathe soon after birth so that <O/> is allowed to assist him or her so that it breathes as fast as possible by what we call mouth-to-mouth breathing We suck we use this one for we put one inside the mouth the nose there and the other one we put into our mouth using <O/> then you suck the mucus which might hinder the baby's breathing Here as well we also have our scissors for cutting the cord of the baby after birth Here again where we have sucker also for sucking the nose of the baby As soon as the baby has come we try as much help we can You squeeze it before you put it on the baby's nose Then you let it expand like that to suck the mucus which are in the baby's nose or throat Then the baby becomes able to breathe This one is also a container for our transport <O/> When you want to take something in a sterile region you come and take one take it like this then go with it and take what you need to strengthen a solution where also people free from infection <$E> Comments on the impact of traditional birth attendance\n<$F> TBAs are also very useful because they motivate mothers to bring their children to the to the clinic for immunisation They live within the community and they know the community very well They know in such and such a home there is a child who is under five who should be brought to the clinic We also use them to motivate the community on family planning They know that the families within their areas very well They know some of their taboos and beliefs So we find them very useful to motivate the community on family planning They are also useful because now they know the cases to refer to the hospital the ones they should deal with and in case there is a deformed baby they know what to do They will always refer them to the hospital where the deformity can be corrected or parents can be advised on how to use on how to take care of these children \n<$A> Giving birth is a natural process Ninety per cent of all births are normal and end up without complication However the risks that affect the remaining ten per cent can be drastically reduced by attending regular check-ups during pregnancy It is recommended that expectant mothers with previous difficulties those under eighteen and those above thirty-five years should deliver in hospitals under the assistance of qualified health workers This should go a long way towards saving the lives of both mother and child Have a healthy week", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a51379ad-f8de-4aab-85c9-5bb0ad9ba2a1',

{'text': "<$A> Igara Kabaji\nA programme that focuses on modern trends in our cultural and ethical development\n<$A> In this week's edition of the programme we focus on the *indiscipline> of <ea/>matatu drivers and totes Chinua Achebe in his book entitled Troubled Nigeria defines *indiscipline> as the failure or refusal to submit one's desires and actions to the restraints of orderly social contact in recognition of the rights and desires of others He asserts then the goal of *indiscipline> is self-interest Its action the abandonment of self-restraint in pursuit of the goal but the action may sometimes defeat the goal Sometimes when one reflects seriously about the problems of this nation the temptation to agree with Achebe on this matter is great Indeed *indiscipline> is by definition distinct from lawlessness The line between the two is often tenuous indeed But the problem we have in our society is that *indiscipline> in some sector has escalated into lawlessness What we have is therefore mass *indiscipline> This is not an exaggeration Any rational Kenyan knows that we have a serious problem in the transport sector There is indeed no better place to observe *indiscipline> at its best in Kenya than on the roads The <ea/>matatu drivers and totes have actually become a nuisance They seem not to have any sense of order and fair play Rarely do they apply themselves intelligently to things that call for this It appears that the <ea/>matatu drivers have decided the traffic rules do not apply to them They break traffic regulations by causing unnecessary traffic jams in the city Sometimes they overtake on the sidewalk recklessly endangering the lives of innocent pedestrians It is this lack of common sense that makes some Kenyans to wonder why mature adults should be proud of breaking rules that govern social order Sometimes it beats all logic It makes some of us wonder whether we are sinking into savagery or we are building a civilised society The irony is that some of these people who have no sense of order they have criticised others especially in the political sphere for mistakes they themselves are masters of Let us face it if the <ea/>matatu and bus drivers cannot respect traffic rules and if they cannot be made to then we shall continue to lose a large number of able-bodied Kenyans through accidents The senseless murder of fellow Kenyans through what is referred to as accidents is the most revolting thing of this decade For sure speed limit does not exist to this driver The needless horror and death intelligent people bring to others is quite shameful When will our people learn to do things without being supervised Why should policemen be dotted all over to remind the drivers that they need to obey traffic rules If one is disciplined he or she does not invite supervision by an external force Discipline is imposed by the individual from within Indeed discipline is either self-discipline or it is nothing at all If one has received adequate social education then he or she should know that it is in his or her interest to follow rules but the <ea/>matatu drivers are not alone in this mad chase for money They are assisted heavily by their <O/> men Otherwise referred to as totes or in street language <ea/>manamba The <ea/>manamba are perhaps the most *indisciplined> lot in the country They first and foremost specialised in making noise Approach any bus stop and you will hear them howling like wild animals The reason why they howl is really not clear because every Kenyan who has been say to Nairobi knows the number of the bus or <ea/>matatu that goes to his or her destination Why should these people howl and force you into a <ea/>matatu even before you make up your mind to enter the <ea/>matatu Intelligent people need silence to think about what is expected of them The kind of noise we encounter in some places in our towns really inconveniences many people The *indiscipline> of the <ea/>manamba manifests itself just when you approach the door of the <ea/>matatu If you are a woman then your tribulations will be more One for instance will run and hold your waist as if you are a lover If you get offended and complain what follows sometimes are abuses But if you are patient enough and enter the <ea/>matatu then another nightmare begins You are pushed and packed as if you are a sacks of <O/> If you resist abuses follow Some passengers interviewed confessed that they have been at times threatened by <ea/>rungos Then the music is played at full volume Why these totes and drivers imagine that music played at full volume makes sense defeats reason In fact what people listen to is not music but noise Some time back playing of loud music was prohibited but again <ea/>matatu drivers and totes do not respect rules Of course passengers feel bad but Kenyans being what they are peace-loving people they do not complain aloud but for sure they hate this madness Let us however remember that as <ea/>matatu drivers and totes flout traffic rules there are many Kenyans especially those who drive who are quite organised They follow traffic rules and just wonder why their fellow Kenyans fail to employ their common sense But the fear is soon or later they might be infected by this madness which appears contagious The big question however is why this *indiscipline> What went wrong Of course the answer is simple Greed for money has simply turned our brothers into monsters Sometimes they can charge any amount of money they want to They do not even respect the old people This is something that really worries rational people We know that in our culture there is insistence on respect for elders There are several reasons First in the traditional system of education the elders taught younger ones all there was to be learnt Now in every teacher student relationship the student has to respect the teacher That respect generates the humility that is needed if we have to continue learning Young people therefore have to respect elders In <ea/>matatus you will hear them shouting at elders as if they are age-mates Sometimes when some of us think about the future we wonder how the country shall be like when these confused people will be elder If these people continue to nurture this rampaging selfishness will they have time to build a disciplined society The truth of the matter is that we must recognise the emergence status of this situation and treat it accordingly This nation can do better only if we eradicate *indiscipline> over few people before it spreads \nAnd on that note listener we come to the end of this week's edition of the programme Culture Talk This programme was produced by George Okode and I am Igara Kabaji saying goodbye\n\n<$A> The philosophy behind the whole exercise was that traditional oral literature is replete with sex type trawls that are redundant The narratives for example perpetrate certain stereotypes of men and women where such characteristics may no longer be valid due to the social economic and political changes taking place the world over\nfrom different people <name/> convened a seminar where the entries were read evaluated and recommended or not recommended for publication The seminar was held at the Salvud Hotel Milimani from August twentieth to twenty-second and was opened by the director of African Women's Communication Network FEMNET Dr Edda Chachukia In her keynote address Dr Chachukia gave a very precise background to the whole question of gender naturally leading to the point of how <O/> and oral literature come into the whole spectrum The whole question of gender gained momentum when the United Nations declared the decade from nineteen seventy-six to nineteen eighty-six the UN Decade for Women It had been realised that women who constitute half the world's population remained marginalized and unaccounted for in development terms This marginalization resulted largely from the ignorance of development planners in the nineteen fifties and nineteen sixties The crucial role of women as producers was ignored and a picture of man as the family bread winner was and still is being perpetrated <name/> observed that technology has not necessarily improved the lot of women In fact it has added to their load of work For example the introduction of the ox plough meant that more land came under cultivation This essentially increased the amount of weeding and planting to be done mainly by women The increased enrolment of children in schools in itself has deprived women of domestic helpers hence increasing their work-load and creating a lot of strain on their time resources Because of the differentiated roles women continue to play in society there was need to examine their participation in this context This necessitated a shift from the women in development strategy to the gender and development approach which concerns itself with the gender roles and relationships and tries to influence them for the greatest benefits to individual communities and society as a whole In other words the gender and development strategy takes stock of the status quo the factors that have determined that status quo and how they can be changed for the better This obviously cannot be done without creating a new cultural ethic and one tool creating this ethic is literature whether oral or written Oral literature as we know it plays a very important role in socialising the child into the beliefs attitudes traditions and history of his or her society The gender images the child receives persist in the mind and are near impossible to change in later life If the society's oral literature or all other art is influenced to depict both men and women in desirable light then this is what the child carries into adulthood It may be felt among conservatives that going to the extent of deliberately creating stories with a particular ideology in mind is prostituting literature But one must also realise that oral literature is not static In fact there are already so many narratives and songs that have been recreated by artists to suit different ideological purposes The process might be said to have been slow with regard to gender But that only makes it more urgent to go out of the way and infuse gender into the material that we have The conservatives will argue that creativity is inspired and that the artist should not be given a blueprint not to deviate from in his or her creation But the fact also is that artists do not get inspired in a vacuum They basically have the society's experiences to talk about in the society's language They're therefore subject to the dictations of these factors even before they start creating in which case it may not be valid to regard the <O/> exercise as propaganda Indeed this reminds us of the old debate about what is good literature and what is not On one side there are those who have always viewed literature as an instrument of social action They contend that literature cannot be divorced from the social concerns of the society and that it must articulate the needs of the majority of that society When it does not do this then it is regarded as escapist literature On the other hand there are those who contend that literature is a purely creative venture which may or may not be dictated by social issues To them what literature must achieve is a beauty of form Critics of this approach will point out that our society cannot afford such literature that is only aesthetic when all around us there is turmoil poverty and inequality The <O/> emphasis therefore falls under the socially committed approach to literature that which realises that there are gross balances in the society and go out of the way to correct them As it were we cannot at this moment in history have writers for the sake of writing not as far as the gender question is concerned Dr Chachukia summarised it effectively when she said that Kenya needs writers who are knowledgeable about who we are where we have come from and where we're headed to She said such writers will be able to create literature that recognises changes in the society and works towards liberation from negative conservatism If we can start with oral literature why not \nS2BTAL1K\n<$A> You are listening to KBC Nairobi The time is now a quarter to eight \n<$B><Coming up we're playing Ties that Bind Meet experts overall for practical tools some understanding where love and tenderness can be nurtured back to both So let us hold our eyes and say amen \n<$C> After listening to your programme I felt that I've <AmE/>gotten the answer to my long-time problems which started back in nineten eighty-six I'm thirty-three years of age and a mother of three aged between thirteen and nine years legally married for thirteen years My problem started after my father-in-law's death At least he was able to control his son when I went to him with various complaints Since his death I have never known what peace is And this has made me hate my husband My ignorance initially made me live with him without noticing his immoral immorality But after he turned violent I started seeing through him I was an innocent girl when he married me Nowadays I wonder if I ever loved him though Well may be it was but the character changed me into a totally different woman I've tried to bear with him but I'm seeing disaster in the near future if something is not done What do I do Please help me He has subjected me to a lot of humiliations and brain torture that I feel I am worth nothing though he claims to love me I don't love him anymore I moved to stay up-country to see if I could work but all in vain When he comes my God his breath alone makes me want to throw up when he wants to kiss me \n<$C> Thank you very much Elisabeth for this emotional letter and thank you <name/> for reading it out for us With us in the studio once again is our expert in counselling Joan Kohenange And she is going to highlight us on this problem\n<$D> Thank you Tabita I thank you very much Elisabeth It takes courage and strength of character to be able to write about problems you've experienced in thirteen years of your marital life married life You mentioned in your letter that your father-in-law was able to control your husband and since his death you feel helpless and unable to continue living with him It seems as if you are trying to avoid a confrontation with your husband by moving up-country However you mentioned that when he visits you expect to act like his wife If you suspected he is immoral that he is engaging in sexual intercourse with other women it is important that you consider ways in which you can protect yourself from sexually transmitted and fatal infections such as HIV or AIDS You have also written that your husband is a violent man Maybe before I talk about the violence I just want to emphasise on these uh sexually transmitted diseases a little HIV or AIDS is very real In our counselling offices we are getting many many people coming in people who are already infected with the virus and people who are hurting because their relatives are infected with the virus So we are getting in our centres the infected and the affected people and it is a serious situation The disease is not sparing anyone from the executives incorporations corporate circles in hotel industries two messengers and cleaners in government offices AIDS is not sparing anyone Homes are in a <O/> For you all dear listeners and also for you Elisabeth I just want to let people know that this is a serious disease and people should take precaution because many people are already infected and many people are already dying Now to get back to Elisabeth and the area of violence You spoke about your husband being a violent man who has subjected you to physical and emotional abuse It means in one way or the other Elisabeth that your husband has lost respect for you Violence is not good And I want to add here that violence is a learned behaviour Your husband chooses He has a choice He chooses to subject you to that humiliation No way Elisabeth but no way can you cause your husband to beat you senseless like a little child You are not a child and neither is he He has chosen to use force on you Therefore he is solely responsible for the behaviour Even if he has decided to how come Elisabeth that he doesn't go and beat his boss You see he's specifically used to beat He could just as well have chosen to go and beat his mother or even his brothers and sisters or even his children but he doesn't He is very selective about his beating habits and he has chosen you as the person who is going to meet out his vengeance on So really it is a learned behaviour He has chosen to beat you He can just as well un-choose to beat you He can unlearn the behaviour and it is wrong for society to continue to ignore these insults on women No man has a right to beat his wife Women are not property They are just like men human beings We know men of character don't beat their wives It is when men are threatened and they are feeling insecure that they have to lush out at something weaker than themselves And I just want to repeat this violence physical violence especially or any other form of abuse of a women is learned behaviour and it can be unlearned just uh just the same way as it was learned and it's no excuse and it's not right for man to say oh my wife made me do it How does she make him do it She didn't hold your hand to her face to her eye for you to beat her\n<$D> They say they are provoked\n<$E> How come women are not provoked to beat him their husbands It's unfair for someone who is stronger to go and mete out such vengeance on a weaker person Listeners there are alternative ways of trying to communicate on a basis to your spouse It doesn't have to be by beating One can communicate by talking by arranging a <O/> a little <O/> personal home <O/> or something like that There are other alternatives Beating is not the answer That is physical abuse of women Elisabeth you need to make the decision as to whether you wish to remain in such a traumatising and dissatisfying marriage It becomes very confusing when a man makes you feel worthless and unhappy But he claims that he loves you on one hand bashes you around and really kills you On the other he says with his you know with his mouth he speaks and says he loves you Somehow they don't the two don't seem chained together When in doubt always look to the behaviour not to the words that are coming up from the mouth When you consider the options available Elisabeth you may decide that to be best to continue the marriage may be so as not to hurt the children or you may decide that may be living alone may be better in order to try and make the situation better for yourself However if your husband no longer respects you and uses every opportunity to humiliate you maybe he's putting forth a message He wants you to leave and as such then you are better off gone Your husband is not likely to change his attitude towards you no matter what you do right now whether it involves moving away or trying to do things to please him or agreeing to find arrangements that may result in peace to you or your children in the future But on the other hand Elisabeth I don't want you to totally give up on him I would suggest that you pray for him that perhaps God may touch him In other results total conversion may take place a total roundabout change It takes God to make a marriage successful not luck or chance\n<$D> Joan at times you advise uh a couple to separate \n<$E> Yes There are times I would suggest okay the choice is always left to the spouse that has come in with a problem but there are times I would suggest that may be wise at a point in time for the couple to separate \n<$D> Why\n<$E> and with this young man who was so used to beating up his wife physically abusing her hitting her with anything crockery anything just anything in the household he gets hold of he just throws it and when he gets off her he doesn't care where he gets hold of her whether it's her hair her arm whatever he would just grab her round and really give her a thorough bashing and then it went on and it continued from bad to worse One point he would chase her with rocks in his hands He'd go out and get the biggest stone come round and throw the stone on her sometimes the stones connect sometimes they didn't The last time was when he chased her around with a axe I mean he was ready to hack her to death and he was that angry and burst with such violence So at that point uh uh we decided it's better to separate than one spouse kill the other one and then after that we start talking And sure enough they separated but uh it was the case was able to resolve the issues uh and we got support from the family and uh we walked through it\n<$D> Thank you very much listener We continue from there \n<$C> If you are touched by our programme and would like to share any form of suffering and anguish as well as joys and sorrow in family write to the producer Ties that Bind at PO Box three oh four five six Nairobi This programme was produced by Tabita Motony Ties that Bind Be there every Monday at a

Rehabilitation Minister Patrick Massim Haka and UN High Commissioner for Refugees Sakado Ogata\nTwo United States envoys arrived in Sarajevo today to try and persuade the Bosnian government to abandon its boycott of key Bosnian peace talks scheduled to take place in New York this week Edward Mushey\n<$B> Christopher Hayle and Robert Owen arrived in the Bosnian capitol even as Sarajevo repeated its demands that it wanted guarantees that any possible peace settlement for the former Yugoslavian Republic would not involve its partition The United States diplomats were sent to Sarajevo yesterday following Sarajevo's announcement that it will not take part in tomorrow's talks with the Croatian and <O/> Yugoslav foreign ministers to discuss a peace plan for Bosnia-Herzegovina The Bosnian information ministry has said that Hayle a specialist in central European territory claims and Owen a lawyer will start talks at the Bosnian presidency at ten thirty a m The talks between the United States envoys and Bosnian government officials today are expected to open up Bosnian idea of a draft peace plan which Sarajevo fears sanctions the fact of partition of Bosnia-Herzegovina Bosnian misgivings prompted President Alija Izetbegovic to announce yesterday night that Sarajevo would boycott the New York talks which were scheduled to bring Bosnian Foreign Minister Mohammed <name/> together with his counterparts from Croatia and rest Yugoslavia\n<$A> <O/> talks between the major players by the American States Department envoy Richard Holbrooke the Foreign Ministers of Bosnia Croatia and Serbia agreed to sit down together in Geneva Switzerland for preliminary peace talks Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim led government made clear what they want out of any peace settlements The Serbs want to remain in control of as much of the territory they have seized on the battle field as possible The government is still intending rebuilding a unitary state What about the Croatian government Zagreb has encouraged Bosnian Croats to build their own de facto state and they have shown novel misgivings although there has been no fighting between Croats and Muslims for some time As Richard Korathes reports from Croatian capitol Zagreb the goals cannot meet the hidden ambitions \n<$C> In March nineteen ninety-four more than a year of vicious fighting between Croats and Muslims in Bosnia ended when they agreed with some American arm twisting to form a federation President Clinton watched over the signing of the accord in Washington while Croatian president Franjo Tudjman heralded it as a new era in relations between his state and neighbouring Bosnia \n<$D> The historic step which has been taken today will be of immense mutual benefit for Croats and Bosnian Muslims laying a strong foundation for lasting peace and the stable future in this region and assuring for both peoples full national sovereignty and full parity in state affairs \n<$C> When the war broke out in Bosnia-Herzegovina in nineteen ninety-two the Croats and Muslims were initially allied against the Serbs who quickly seized two thirds of the country Tension built up between Croats and Muslims as refugees flooded what was left of government held territory Extreme nationalist Croats seized south western Herzegovina and brutally expelled Muslims as they carved out a break away republic they called Herzeg Bosnia Commentator from broadcast from the Balkans Nana Cebec argues that it was inevitable relations between the two communities would break down \n<$E> It was never an alliance it was only a marriage of convenience The heartland of Croatian nationalism lies not in Croatia proper but lies in western Herzegovina the south uh western corner of Bosnia-Herzegovina That is where you will find the most fierce Croat nationalists and they are the ones who started the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina against uh Bosnian Muslims It was a very vicious war That fighting was stopped under heavy pressure by Washington and we had early in nineteen ninety-four the shot gun wedding between Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims\n<$C> A year and a half later an uneasy alliance between the Croats and Muslims is still holding The Washington agreement not only created a federation between the Muslims and Croats in Bosnia but also a confederation between Bosnia and neighbouring Croatia That allowed the Muslims to have access to the sea via Croatia's coastline while Bosnian Croats were given some political links with Croatia proper in the hope they would abandon attempts to unify with the motherland But has the deal eased suspicions between Muslims and Croats led to no co-operation on the ground Nana Cebec again\n<$E> None whatsoever apart from some tactical uh fighting against the Serbs In Mostar uh where I been just a month ago which is uh supposed to be a unified city once again not a single step has been made towards a proper alliance between Croats and Muslims On the contrary what I have seen on the ground is just as much hatred uh and the desire to live separately as one saw may be a year and a half ago when the fighting was at its fiercest", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> We present A New Book of African Verse a collection of poems edited by John Reed and Cliff Waite This programme is for forms three and four This is the first of eight programme s on a New Book of African Verse In this introductory programme we shall be discussing poetry generally We shall also examine two poems by the late Angolan President poet Augustino Netu In the studio with me are the radio teacher and his two students Njeri and Omolo Welcome to the programme \n<$B> Hello students in this lesson we shall deal with poetry generally We shall also examine two poems by Augustino Netu Now poetry anthologies can be organised in various ways For instance a whole collection can be organised by theme You could have an anthology of humorous poetry For example this would be a collection of verse by different poets but the connecting link between all these poems would be humour Each of the  poems would be humorous or witty in some way Similarly you can find  collections of love poetry war poetry and so on Yes Omolo I can see you have something to say already Go ahead\n<$C> Besides collections of poetry based on subjects like love and war and so on there are other ways in which poems can be collected in one book For example my elder sister who enjoys reading poetry has two collections of poems by Kenyan poets One is called Tensions and all the poems in this collection are by a single poet Richard Ntiru The other is a collection of poems by Michere Mugo and is titled Daughter of My People Sing\n<$B> Good point Omolo Yes that is another way poetry can be collected together between two covers As you say all the poems in some collections are by a single poet Now on what general basis are the poems in A New Book of African Verse collected together\n<$A> The title of this collection explains that All the poems in this collection are by African poets\n<$B> Correct all the poems in this book are by poets from our continent Yes Njeri what do you wish to say\n<$D> Well I don't understand why this book is called A New Book of African Verse After all there are only two poems from East Africa and both these are by Ugandan poets Taban lo Liyong and Okot p'Bitek I don't see any poems from Kenya Tanzania Zaire or Malawi\n<$B> Yes that's a relevant objection Njeri I was a bit disappointed myself to see not a single Kenyan poet represented here and we certainly have some very good poets It seems that most of the poets in this collection are from South or West Africa Our country and our region have been neglected Did you notice that this collection is titled A New Book of African Verse Well now this is because though it was published in nineteen eighty-four It is a revised edition of a book originally published in nineteen sixty-four The first edition was titled A Book of African Verse and in that book the editors include the poem Karioki by a Kenyan poet Joseph Gatueria That first edition also included two poems by the Malawian poet David Rubadiri who has spent many many years in Kenya and Uganda but both these poets have been excluded from A New Book of African Verse Other poets especially those from South Africa have been included instead Before we actually start examining individual poems let me first ask you students what you understand by poetry Yes Omolo\n<$C> To me poetry is written in lines and verses not in paragraphs as in prose\n<$B> Yes uh that's one definition of poetry A poem is written in lines rather than in continuous sentences and paragraphs as is prose Njeri any other ideas \n<$D> I have noticed that in poetry the writer often compares things He will say one thing is like another and that it resembles in some way For example if the poet is writing about a woman he loves he might compare her to a flower or a jewel or something that is lovely and treasured In this way he tells us both how beautiful she is and also how dearly he loves her\n<$B> Very good Njeri and what do we call this kind of comparison of one thing to another in poetry Yes Omolo\n<$C> We call it a simile\n<$B> That's correct We call comparisons between objects or persons similes In this way the poet makes clear to us the particular thing or person or feeling he is describing Omolo what other devices does a poet use\n<$C> Sometimes the poet uses sound to make real for us the thing or person he's writing about For example I have read a poem about a thunderstorm and the poem ends like this\n\nNow a word like jagged makes us see the lightening zigzagging across the sky Well the sound of words like rumble tremble and crack make us hear the thunder of this storm\n<$B> Excellent observation Omolo So to summarize we can say that the poet uses various techniques or methods to make his poem vivid and memorable He uses similes and sounds and images Now all this becomes clearer to you as we actually read and examine the individual poems but there is one last thing I would like to mention before we start on Netu's poems I want you to keep firm in mind that in our study of the poems we shall pay equal attention to theme and style theme and style Well Njeri what do you understand by theme \n<$D> I think the theme of a poem is its subject matter It is the main idea that the poet wishes to communicate in that particular poem\n<$B> Quite right The theme refers to the subject matter or content of a poem It refers to what the poet is saying that is to those feelings and experiences he is trying to tell us about in his poem Omolo what do you understand by the expression the style of a poem\n<$C> The style of a poem refers to the various methods the poet uses to make his poem fine and memorable Style refers to the kind of words he selects These will be the most appropriate words in the particular place in the poem where they appear Style also refers to other poetic devices like rhythm that is the beat of a poem or to the image and similes and sound the poet uses\n<$B> You have explained the meaning of a poet's style very clearly So remember in our study of poems we shall emphasise the poet's ideas or themes as much as his style Okay let us now move on to study two poems by the Angolan poet Augustino Netu These poems are on pages forty-nine and fifty of your text Let us first read his poem Between Njeri will you please read the poem for us You will find it on page forty-nine\n<$D> Between by Augustino Netu\n\n<$B> Thank you Njeri Well what is this poem about What is the poet saying in Between\n<$D> He is saying that human life is made up of pain but also of joy\n<$B> Yes human life consists of moments of pain and other moments of happiness Let us see how the poet expresses his idea The poem is composed of three verses and Netu uses each verse to express a particular idea Omolo would you like to explain the idea contained in each of the poem's three verses\n<$C> In the first verse he says that human beings experience unhappiness and sorrow In the second verse he shows how they also experience joy In the final verse he says that despite both this joy and sorrow the continent of Africa can plan a better future for itself and its people\n<$B> Very good Omolo That's very brilliant Now you have briefly explained what the poet's idea and theme are about Now let us go back to those three verses to see how Netu expresses his ideas that is we shall now be concentrating on his style In verse one how particularly does the poet convey the idea of human distress\n<$D> Netu uses a horrible image to make us feel the human distress he mentions The image is of reptiles and worms in a mudhole They are getting ready to destroy a beautiful human child\n<$B> Yes and how are these worms preparing to destroy the child\n<$D> The poet doesn't say exactly how but I think he hints that the child will die perhaps of hunger or sickness and then it will be consumed of worms\n<$B> Yes the poet doesn't actually specify how the child will die but in that horrible ugly image he suggests that it will be destroyed by worms and reptiles These worms will eat the child after he dies but the reptiles refer to the various evils that children of Africa are exposed to today Evils like hunger and disease So we have seen how the poet uses images to convey ideas In this case the image of reptiles and worms explains how life is threatened by pain and evil and sorrow The reptiles stand for evils like hunger and disease The worms stand for death and the target of these evils is the innocent child who is destroyed even before he has had a chance to live and experience the goodness life has to offer Now what about the second verse How does the poet express that other side of human life its joy Yes Njeri\n<$D> Here the poet uses images like dawn and hymn to express the joy and glory of being human and this happiness defeats the enemies of human life the worms and reptiles\n<$B> Yes indeed The poet expresses the beauty and hope of human existence in images like dawn and hymn of earth and this joy this hope is clearly seen in the poet's choice of words and phrases Omolo select those words and phrases that communicate the deep joy in human existence\n<$C> Words like delight dawn sweet and strong resounding intoxication hymn Through these words the poet tries to show the depth and the intensity of happiness human beings can experience\n<$B> Good Finally in the third verse Netu is saying that between the good and the evil in life the people of our continent can start to create a new world of hope and harmony How do we know he's referring to Africa\n<$D> He refers to Africa poetically as a great track from the Niger to the Cape\n<$B> Yes and how can Africa create this harmony and hope\n<$C> We are told how Africa can create this harmony and hope in the third and fourth lines where <ea_><ea/> That is Africa can create this hope with its hands and its culture\n<$B> Correct The mention of <ea/>marimbas and drums probably refers to Africa's culture Notice how the word hands is repeated This suggests it's through human effort and skill that we create the glorious Africa to come The Africa of unity and joy Well let us end our lesson today by briefly examining another poem by Netu This is on pages forty-nine and fifty and is called Night Njeri please read it for us\n<$D> Night by Augustino Netu \n\n<$B> Thank you Njeri Now would you agree with me that this poem isn't as hopeful as Between\n<$C> Yes I agree The poem Night describes how it feels to belong to the deprived and miserable slum  townships of the world\n<$B> Yes but how does Netu express the hopelessness of life in the slums Omolo\n<$C> He does this mainly by the words he uses For example adjectives like dark unlit and unfamiliar tell us that the slum the speaker lives in lacks electricity and street lights It is without light or life so he has to find his way through the slum by feeling his way rather than seeing his way\n<$D> He also uses verbs like propped feeling tumbling stumbling and blocked These words tell us that the slum dweller lacks control over his own life Finally nouns like mystery dread and ghost tell us what frustrates the speaker's plans and dreams The poet makes an important point in verse four Here he says that in these miserable slums men take one another for things That is individuals are not respected or accorded their human dignity Instead they are exploited and used as mere objects", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd525ad35-061f-4b96-bfbf-cea035cea516',

{'text': "<$A> We present Agriculture for Standard Seven Pupils Hello boys and girls Welcome to agriculture programme series Today's programme is entitled mineral deficiency symptoms and their control in crops \n<$B> In order for plants to grow healthy and give us more yields they must be supplied with plant food nutrients These food nutrients are in form of mineral salts mineral salts Plants must have these mineral salts for proper growth They are therefore referred to as essential elements essential elements Some of them are needed in large amounts Others are needed in small amounts The essential elements or minerals in the soil needed by plants in large quantities are one nitrogen nitrogen two phosphorus phosphorus three potassium potassium four calcium calcium five magnesium magnesium and six sulphur sulphur Those ones needed in smaller quantities include one chlorine chlorine two iron iron three zinc zinc four manganese manganese five molybdenum molybdenum six sodium sodium seven boron boron and eight copper copper Most soils in Kenya usually lack the following essential minerals one nitrogen two phosphorus and three potassium These three minerals are needed in even greater quantities by the plants Crops growing in soils where any of these minerals is lacking will show hunger signs These hunger signs are referred to as mineral deficiency symptoms mineral deficiency symptoms To learn more on this we shall listen to a conversation between a farmer Mr <name/> and an agricultural officer Mr <name/>\n<$C> Oh what a poor harvest from my three hectares of maize I can't believe it Only three bags Am I cursed What could have gone wrong\n<$D> Good morning Mr <name/> \n<$C> Oh I'm quite fine Sir Honestly I did not notice you coming\n<$D> What is the matter with you You look sad Anything wrong in the house\n<$C> No no Not in the house But something is very wrong there the farm Look this is the only maize I got from this whole <ea/>shamba Can you believe that\n<$D> I now understand It means that your crops went hungry You did not feed them properly\n<$C> I did put some manure before planting And I weeded the crop twice\n<$D> You see Mr <name/> you need to understand this that crops need a balanced diet just like you and me They need certain food in form of mineral salts These mineral salts are sold as fertilisers If you failed provide proper fertilisers you will continue to have low yields \n<$C> I see I see Tell me how can I tell when my crops are hungry The crops do not talk or cry like we do or animals do\n<$D> You're right But they show signs when they are lacking certain minerals For example we have a mineral known as nitrogen nitrogen It is a must that a plant has nitrogen for proper growth\n<$C> How do I tell that my crop is lacking nitrogen\n<$D> A crop lacking nitrogen will have for example leaves which change to yellow and these leaves will be poorly formed The crops will also not be able to grow to their full size and they can easily be attacked by diseases \n<$C> What else am I likely to observe in a crop lacking nitrogen \n<$D> The roots are poorly developed These roots will start to die from the tip backwards The same thing will happen to stems They will start to die from the tip backwards And in grasses the tips of lower leaves may turn brown This yellow colour will spread along the mid-rib until the whole leaf dies \n<$C> I'm beginning to understand Tell me officer after strong wind blew over my maize garden a lot of the plants were left lying flat on the ground Why do you think this happened\n<$D> I must say that was a good observation It showed that your maize plants had weak stems You see when plants lack nitrogen they develop weak stems And when wind blows over such weak stems they are made to lie down This condition is known as lodging lodging Crops need adequate supply of nitrogen to grow well \n<$B> Well class as the agricultural officer says crops require adequate supply of nitrogen If crops lack nitrogen they will show nitrogen deficiency symptoms Shall we write them down Ready Nitrogen deficiency symptoms in crops are one leaves become yellow leaves become yellow two there is slow growth there is slow growth three roots are poorly formed roots are poorly formed four easy attack by diseases easy attack by diseases five lodging spelled l o d g i n g lodging lodging spelled l o d g i n g and six in grasses lower leaves die slowly from the bottom in grasses lower leaves die slowly from the bottom It is also important to note that nitrogen is needed by plants for the following reasons one nitrogen encourages vegetative growth two nitrogen gives green colour to the plants and three nitrogen is part of protein Class let us now go back to the conversation of Mr <name/> and Mr <name/>\n<$D> Another mineral salt which crops need in very very large amounts is phosphorus And this phosphorus is also supplied as fertiliser especially at planting time \n<$C> What are its hunger signs in plants\n<$D> Firstly the plants will have slow growth Secondly crops lacking phosphorus will take a long time to mature Thirdly after harvesting the yields are very low Fourthly crops such as maize wheat and barley have thin stems The leaves in maize turn purple in colour \n<$C> And what would you say are the uses of phosphorus in plants\n<$D> Phosphorus is important for the proper root development and that is why it must be supplied at planting time Phosphorus will speed up maturing of crops such as maize And lastly phosphorus is important for the development of reproductive parts of the plants that is flowers and fruits \n<$C> I wish you had come earlier I would have been smiling now over a good harvest \n<$B> Class you have learnt that phosphorus is another mineral salt that crops require in very large quantities We have been told that lack of phosphorus in crops will result in the following deficiency symptoms Please write them down One slow growth slow growth two slender or thin stalks slender or thin stalks three delayed maturity delayed maturity four low yields low yields and five purple colour in maize leaves purple colour in maize leaves We've also been told that fertiliser containing phosphorus should be applied at planting time This will help in one development of roots two quick maturing of crops and three development of reproductive parts of the plants mainly flowers and fruits Let us now hear more from the conversation between Mr <name/> and Mr <name/>\n<$D> There is also another mineral salt that plants need in large quantity Your crop of maize must have it to give you better yields \n<$C> Which one is it\n<$D> It is called potassium Potassium like nitrogen and phosphorus also comes as a fertiliser We are lucky that our soils do not have serious shortages of potassium But where symptoms show you must supply it to the crops in form of fertilisers \n<$C> Which are the symptoms of potassium deficiency on crops\n<$D> Lack of potassium in crops will be shown in the following ways One leaves will be half burned and spotted Two lower leaves will curl Three stems and branches will be weak and often will fall off before maturity Four roots and tubers develop poorly And five orange trees will look spotted \n<$C> After preparing charcoal on a piece of my <ea/>shamba the maize planted there did very well Do ashes have any mineral \n<$D> What a good observation you made Ashes and stalks of cereal crops have a high percentage of potassium But remember burning has more harm > than good on soil Burning will kill micro-organisms in the soil Extensive burning may cause soil erosion Why not use manures and fertilisers recommended for better results We're always there to help you remember \n<$A> That was agriculture programme series for standard seven pupils Today's programme was on mineral deficiency symptoms in crops This programme was written by Ephraim <name/> It was edited and produced by Peter <name/> Your presenters were Nancy <name/> Nation <name/> and Fidelis <name/> The programme was recorded by Evanson <name/> for the Educational Media Service Kenya Institute of Education Next week we shall discuss the soil conservation methods Till then good bye \n\n<$A> We present Agriculture for Standard Seven Pupils Hello boys and girls This is Agriculture In today's programme we'll discuss methods of soil conservation Welcome to the programme \n<$B> Soil must be prevented from being carried away by wind and water This is what we mean by the term soil conservation We want to retain the good top soil We need this top soil to grow crops and rear livestock There are many methods used in conserving soil Today we shall discuss some of these methods The methods of soil conservation that we shall discuss are one contour farming two strip cropping three terracing four grassed waterways and five gabions In the studio we have a pupil called <name/> <Name/> will be visiting a local farmers' training centre near his school We shall hear him talking to the agricultural instructor in the Institute Mr <name/> Now let us listen to what they say about soil conservation methods \n<$C> Good morning Sir\n<$D> Good morning to you young man What can I do for you\n<$C> My name is <name/> I come from Henny Primary School and I am in class seven \n<$D> Yes I know Henny Primary School very well I know most of the teachers What exactly is your problem Do not be afraid Feel free with me I'm also a teacher of adults I train farmers \n<$C> Sir we are studying the topic soil conservation methods I would like to know more about these methods of soil conservation As a matter of fact we have been given an assignment to find out more on this topic\n<$D> Well well now I understand But for you to understand better I suggest we move over to our demonstration farm Let's go Here we are Let's stop now We have many methods of soil conservation displayed on this farm But for a start let me hear from you what methods you use at home to conserve the soil \n<$C> Where I come from is very hilly So during cultivation such as digging or weeding we cultivate across the slope For this reason there is little or no loss to our top soil \n<$D> Oh that's beautiful Cultivating across the slope is a nice way towards soil conservation It is one of several steps towards soil conservation \n<$C> But Sir can you tell me the reason behind cultivating across the slope What really happens that the soil is prevented from being washed away \n<$D> You see cultivating across the slopes helps to check the direction and speed of the waterflow This means the water flows slowly and in this way most of the water sinks into the soil If you dug up the slope you'll be making it easier for the water to flow down easily and very fast As it does it carries away a lot of soil the top soil you need But I think the best results can even be got through cultivating along the contours It is more or less similar to what you have described \n<$C> Contour\n<$D> Yes contour method of soil conservation Why do you sound surprised at my mentioning the word contour Have you heard it before \n<$C> Our teacher told us that a contour is a line joining points of the same height above sea level Contouring is done by surveyors when mapping an area\n<$D> You are very correct Therefore cultivation by help of the contour line is called contour cultivation contour cultivation\n<$C> But how is this done\n<$D> This means that you dig following the contour You also plant your maize or beans or potatoes whatever crop following the contours All this will help to check the waterflow after the rain", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$A> We present Business Education for Standard Six pupils This is the first programme this term Our topic today is introduction to business education We shall listen to a standard six pupil called <name/> and her teacher They are in a local shopping centre Let us listen to what they are saying \n<$B> <Name/> we are now at the market place I want you to look around and tell me what the people are doing What do you see people doing \n<$C> I can see some people buying and I can also see some other people selling \n<$B> And what do you see being sold \n<$C> I can see a woman over there selling bananas \n<$B> Yes that woman over there is selling bananas What else can you see\n<$C> Uh I can see some people taking tea and <ea/>mandazi in a kiosk \n<$B> Oh yes You are very observant <name/> Now selling of bananas and selling tea and <ea/>mandazi are business activities \n<$C> I understand Then if selling bananas and selling tea and <ea/>mandazi are business activities then all this market is full of different kinds of business activities \n<$B> You are right <name/> This market is full of different kinds of business activities \n<$C> Then what would you say about that man over there pulling a <ea/>mkokoteni and that other man there repairing shoes\n<$B> Well <name/> that man pulling a <ea/>mkokoteni is in a business activity The man repairing shoes is also in a business activity Pulling a <ea/>mkokoteni repairing shoes are all business activities <ea/>\n<$C> Teacher why was that man ringing the bell shouting so loudly \n<$B> That man is doing business <name/> He is ringing the bell to attract customers to buy his blankets Do you know who customers are \n<$C> No teacher Please explain to me what the word customer means \n<$B> Very well <name/> listen carefully then A customer is a person who buys things from other people For example when you buy something from a shop you are a customer of that shop If you buy a blanket from that man then you are a customer of that man So the man who is ringing the bell is trying to attract customers to come and buy his blankets \n<$C> I understand now Then that shop over there has very many customers buying from it \n<$B> You are right <name/> That shop over there has very many customers buying from it \n<$C> But the owner of the shop is not ringing a bell to attract customers Why are there so many customers attracted to that shop\n<$B> Well <name/> I think the best thing to do is to go there and find out Let's go to that shop and find out why there are so many customers I know the owner of the shop His name is Mr <name/> Let us go How are you Mr <name/> \n<$D> I am quite fine <ea/>mwalimu Is there anything I can sell to you and your pupil I have many things in this shop I have sodas biscuits sweets bread and a lot of other things \n<$B> Well Mr <name/> we are not buying anything just now <Name/> and I are trying to see the business activities taking place in this shopping centre <Name/> noticed that your shop has very many customers She wants to know what you do to attract so many customers \n<$D> <ea/>Mwalimu I'll be very happy to explain to your pupil why many customers come to buy in this shop Most customers come to this shop to buy because I have kept many of the things they need As you can see my shop is well stocked with different kinds of goods By stock I mean the items that are kept in the shop for selling \n<$C> Yes I can see that your shop is really well stocked with goods What else do you do to attract customers \n<$D> Well <name/> if you look at the things in this shop I have marked out their prices I normally sell my goods at fair prices So many customers find goods a bit cheaper in my shop Another thing I do to attract customers is to give them a discount When customers buy goods from my shop I give them a discount That is how I attract my customers and that is why they keep coming \n<$C> Is there anything else that you do to attract customers\n<$D> yes of course One thing about customers is that they like honest and friendly shop-keepers If customers discover that a shop-keeper is dishonest and unfriendly then the customers will run away from such a shop-keeper So being kind and friendly is another way of attracting customers \n<$C> You are a very wise business man Mr <name/> Where did you learn all these methods of attracting customers \n<$D> All these things I learned them in school I learned them in business education classes You are very lucky <name/> because your teacher is now teaching you business education in your school When you leave school maybe you'll start a business like mine of keeping a shop \n<$C> Yes and if I start a business like yours I will do just like you are doing sell things at fair prices be honest and friendly to customers and give them discounts \n<$B> Now that you have mentioned something about starting a business Mr <name/> perhaps you could tell <name/> how you started this business of yours \n<$D> Well it is a long story As I have told you I was taught business education in school It is this knowledge which I gained from school that helped me to start the business But for me to start a business money was required You cannot start a business without money \n<$C> How did you get the money Mr <name/> \n<$D> To start my business I got money from different sources I got a loan from the bank I sold some of the property I had and all that I added to my savings All that money enabled me start this business of shop-keeping \n<$C> I think it is a big job to keep a big shop like this one with all that stock Do you really know how much stock you have in the shop Mr <name/> \n<$D> Yes <name/> a good shop-keeper and in fact a good business man keeps a record of all the things in a business As for me I keep a record of all the things you see in the shop In fact I keep a record of the things which I buy and a record of all the things which I sell Everyone should know that it is very important to keep a record for your business Without a written record it would be difficult to remember anything about your business\n<$B> Thank you very much Mr <name/> for what you have told us about your business <name/> and I will return to school <Name/> let us return to school But I want us to pass near that other shop over there which seem to be having only one customer \n<$E> You have given me the wrong change Why I bought goods worth shillings forty-nine My change should be fifty-one shillings but you have given me forty-five shillings Give me my correct change\n<$F> What's wrong with you women Your change is forty-five shillings and that is all \n<$E> You are cheating me My change is fifty-one shillings If you are not giving me my change of fifty-one shillings then take back your goods and give me my money back I'm going to buy from another shop You are a dishonest shop-keeper \n<$F> Listen to me woman Once goods are sold from this shop they are not returnable So take your things away and go away before I lose my temper \n<$E> You are a very rude shop-keeper You are not honest You overcharge I will never buy anything from this shop again \n<$B> <Name/> let us also go away This shop-keeper is not a good business person He is very unfriendly to his customers I am happy we are far away from that man's shop He is rude to his customers Anyway we have learned something from him Let us talk about our day in the shopping centre We have spent a very busy day in the shopping centre Let us try to remember what we have learned from the shopping centre One of the things we have learned is that there are many types of business activities Can you remember some of those business activities \n<$C> Yes I can remember selling bananas and vegetables pulling <ea/>mkokoteni repairing shoes selling tea and <ea/>mandazis in a kiosk are all business activities \n<$B> That is correct selling bananas and vegetables selling tea and <ea/>mandazi pulling <ea/>mkokoteni and repairing shoes are all business activities Now <name/> if you keep a business of your own what would you do to attract customers \n<$C> I would do like Mr <name/> I would sell my goods at a fair price and not overcharge like the bad shop-keeper we saw \n<$B> \n<$C> I would be honest and friendly to my customers I would also keep the things which the customers need and display them well \n<$B> That is correct <name/> To attract customers goods should be displayed well and prices should be fair Being friendly and honest giving discounts are all good ways of attracting customers What do you think of the second shop-keeper <name/> \n<$C> I think the second shop-keeper did not learn business education at all That is perhaps the reason why he did not know how to attract customers \n<$B> That is very good <name/> Tell me now what would you do to enable you to know about all the things in a business \n<$C> Keep records I would keep a record of everything I have in my business \n<$B> Correct <name/> For every business a written record is very important Without a written record one cannot know everything about the business Let me now summarise what we have learned from the visit to the shopping centre At the market centre we saw different business activities taking place there Examples are selling of bananas and vegetables pulling of <ea/>mkokoteni and repairing shoes selling tea and <ea/>mandazi in a kiosk keeping a shop All those are business activities Secondly we met a shop-keeper who explained to us about how to start a business We learned that to start a business money is needed Some sources of money are loans from banks and personal savings Thirdly after a business has been started one must attract customers Some ways of attracting customers are keeping what the customers need selling goods at fair prices giving discounts being honest and friendly to the customers and displaying the goods in a good way For every business a record must be kept Without a written record it would be difficult to remember everything about a business And finally skills and knowledge learnt through business education will enable us to become good business men and business women \n<$A> That was programme number one in the Business Education Series for Standard Six Pupils Your presenters were <name/> <name/> Fidelis <name/> Peter <name/> Elisabeth <name/> and John <name/> The programme was recorded by Henry <name/> and produced by <name/> <name/> for Educational Media Service Kenya Institute of Education Next week we shall learn about importance and sources of money And until then good bye \n\n<$A> We present Business Education for Standard Six Pupils This is the second programme this term The topic is importance and sources of money The radio pupil <name/> and her teacher will be talking about importance and sources of money \n<$B> Hello standard-six pupils Today we shall be talking about importance and sources of money So I want you to listen carefully to our discussion Now <name/> last time I asked you to go and ask your grandfather to tell you how people traded long time ago Did you do that\n<$C> Yes teacher I did \n<$B> And what did he tell you \n<$C> He told me that people used to exchange goods for other goods \n<$B> Did your grandfather explain to you what is meant by exchanging goods for goods", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '9228d8ab-4204-4c0b-b26d-ecd6da0b9bf8', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.011643+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': "<$A> We present oral narratives for forms three and four This is the first of eight programme s on oral narratives In this introductory programme we shall discuss the stylistic aspects of oral narratives With me in the studio is a panel of oral literature students Welcome to the programme \n<$B> <name/> can you start us off by telling the listener what oral literature is\n<$A> Oral literature can be defined as those utterances whether the spoken recited or sung but whose composition and performance shows some artistic characteristics\n<$B> Why do you describe oral literature as artistic\n<$A> Oral literature is artistic in that the performer must show some accurate observation vivid imagination and ingenious expression during performance\n<$B> If oral literature means those words that are composed and performed through the spoken word or by word of mouth what is the relationship between oral and written literature How can literature be oral\n<$C> We call narratives proverbs recitations songs and other forms of oral performance as literature because like the written literature they use language as the medium of communication Also like written literature oral performances are artistic They are intended to move us by appealing to both our understanding and our feelings The written literature also does this by presenting us with well observed characters situations or incidents and by using language effectively to communicate to us\n<$B> Does that therefore mean that we analyse oral literature in the same way as we analyse written literature\n<$C> That's right There are certain stylistic features that are common in both written and oral literature but in oral literature we must always remember that the basic expression is the spoken word\n<$B> What stylistic aspects are common in both written and oral literature\n<$C> Structure language and characters are some of the stylistic aspects found in both oral and written literature\n<$B> Today we are dealing with oral narratives What can you say is the basic structure of oral narratives\n<$A> Narratives are told in prose Normally narratives are longer and more elaborate than the other genres of oral literature A narrative tells a story and a story has a sequence of events\n<$B> Is there any technical term to refer to this series of events\n<$A> Yes the series of events in a narrative are called plot In most oral narratives the plot is very simple The events occur in a straight line one after another But in other narratives the plot is very complex\n<$B> What is a complex plot\n<$C> A narrative may have two or more plots running side by side or at the same time You may also find a narrative that combines a number of stories A narrator can do this to create suspense in the audience He may also create suspense by repeating certain events\n<$B> Is the repetition you are talking about confined only to the plot of the narrative\n<$C> Not at all We also get certain expressions repeated For example a narrator may say he walked and walked and walked then he sat down to rest and he rested and rested and rested This repetition shows us the extent of the character's tiredness It also establishes the amount of time the walking and the resting takes place\n<$B> Many oral narratives begin with phrases like once upon a time a long long time ago a certain man or woman once in a certain place once there lived and many others What do you call such phrases and what's their role in oral narratives\n<$A> Phrases that appear in almost all narratives in the same form are called stock phrases Stock phrases are used as stylistic devices in oral narratives Phrases like once upon a time introduces the narrative It also draws the audience to the world of fiction or to the remote past The narrator would convey the events as they occur in the narrative by using phrases such as then after that\n<$B> Talking about stock phrases reminds me of those characters who appear in most narratives For example the hare the hyena and the tortoise are the commonly used animal characters in most communities in Kenya\n<$A> Among the Luhya of Western Kenya the girl <name/>Simbi is the most common human character in the narratives and among the Luo it is the boy <name/>Obongo\n<$B> What you call such characters\n<$C> Characters who dominate narratives are called stock characters. The hare or the hyena who dominate Kenyan narratives are stock characters Also <name/>Simbi in Luhya narratives and <name/>Obongo in Luo narratives are stock characters\n<$B> What are the functions of characters in narratives\n<$A> As we have just said characters in oral narratives can be human beings animals monsters rocks plants spirits or gods They are usually used to reflect certain qualities like generosity or selfishness wit or stupidity humility or vanity Spirits and divine characters represent the supernatural forces Because the characters in narratives represent certain values we technically refer to that aspect of style as symbolism We can say for example such and such a character symbolises such and such a thing\n<$B> We talk about the interaction of characters in the narratives How do the characters interact\n<$C> Characters in narratives interact through their speeches and actions In many narratives characters have direct conversation between them This is also regarded as an aspect of style in oral narratives It is called the use of dialogue\n<$A> But there is something more on this Sometimes a character is said to be talking loudly to himself or he may be debating on what to do in his mind This aspect of a character talking to himself is called monologue It is a common stylistic feature in oral narratives\n<$B> We have talked about the use of dialogue and monologue in oral narratives What can you say about the use of song in oral narratives\n<$A> Songs are commonly used in oral narratives Their usage can be said to be another aspect of style in oral narratives\n<$B> I believe that songs serve certain purposes in different narratives What are some of these functions\n<$C> Songs have four main functions in oral narratives. Firstly they usually reinforce the themes in the narratives and offer comments on the events and characters Secondly songs may act as a means of communication between characters in the narratives Thirdly they create mood in the narratives The mood will be conveyed or carried in the narrator's voice For example if the story is sad we expect a depressed mood in the song Finally songs break the monotony of narration\n<$B> We can then say that song is a device that helps in sustaining the audience's attention But is song the only method of sustaining the audience's attention\n<$A> No the narrator can also sustain the audience's attention by asking questions or repeating certain sections of the story or repeating the songs during narration This creates suspense It is also a stylistic feature of oral narratives\n<$B> Let us now discuss the stylistic features which are closely related to performance How are the narration sessions introduced\n<$C> Different communities have different ways of introducing their narration sessions For example among my people the Luo the session of narration is introduced by the narrator saying <ea/><O/> This means let the house go gracing let the house go to the end let the house come to the middle let the house be silent\n<$B> I'm sure everybody will listen and wait for the narrative after this announcement What happens next\n<$C> The narrator then introduces the narrative by asking <ea/><O/> can I tell you a story and the audience replies <ea/><O/> tell us a story He then begins the story Among the Akamba community the general opening formula is always the same Whenever a narrator is telling a story to many people he or she would begin this way <ea/><O/> you take a story and the audience would say <ea/><O/> we have taken But if the narrator is telling a story to an individual he would say <ea/><O/> take a story and the listener would respond <ea/><O/> I have taken\n<$A> The Agikuyu start their narration in this way The narrator would say <ea/><O/> I am going to tell you a story and the audience would respond <ea/><O/> tell us This is when the narrator is telling the story to many people When he is telling the story to one person he begins like this <ea/><O/> I am going to tell you a story and the listener would say <ea/><O/> tell me\n<$B> In the three examples you have given us we've noticed that the opening formula is simple and straight forward The narrator uses a stock phrase or formula to alert the audience that he's going to tell them a story The audience in turn acknowledges their readiness to listen to the story How does the Kiswahili speaker start her narration\n<$C> The Kiswahili narrator starts the narration session like this <ea/>\n<$B> You've given us the opening formulas of oral narratives from four communities Do these communities also have closing formulas\n<$C> Yes among the Luo the closing formula goes like this <ea/><O/> which means the end May I grow as tall as my uncle's tree It is important to note that this formula marks the end of just one narrative\n<$B> Does that mean that there is another formula to mark the end of the whole narrative session\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> How does it go\n<$A> I got this formula from the anthology Keep My Words by <name/>Oniango <name/>Ogutu and <name/>Rosku It goes <ea/><O/> which means tale end at bedroom tale end at door tale end at bedroom tale end at ledge\n<$C> The Akamba use different closing formulas depending on the theme and the moral of the narrative Usually the formula is in the form of a proverb or a wish It is important to note that the proverb or the wish is expressed after the narrator has ended her narration by a stock formula like this and that is the end of my story or my story ends there\n<$B> Could you tell us some of the wishes the Akamba story teller may express at the end of the narration\n<$C> Depending on the mood or nature of the story a narrator may use one of the following wishes May you become rich in vermin in your provisions shed but I in cows in my cattle kraal or may your cattle eat earthen mud but mine the good grass or you'd better swing with the tail of the panther while I swing with that of a sheep\n<$B> What is the meaning of the wishes which come at the end of a narration\n<$A> They pose a challenge to the audience The Akamba narrator is to be better off than her listeners For example a sheep's tail is fat and edible and the audience had better learnt to tell stories themselves so that they can eat a tail of a sheep\n<$B> I'd like to add that some closing formulas can be meant for jokes just like the stories are meant for entertainment They can also reflect the practices of a given community Some of the closing formulas are one and that is the end of my story two they remained three and to this day it is on record It is important to note that while not all communities have opening formulas during their narration sessions the formula closing a narrative occurs in most African communities So far you have not said anything about the role of the narrator in a narration session What is her role\n<$C> The narrator plays a central role in the narration A good narrator will make the narrative lively by using physical gestures like nodding pointing a finger or just holding his cheeks He can also vary his voice and facial expressions show agony or joy anger or happiness\n<$B> Why is it necessary for a story teller to use gestures or vary his voice\n<$C> It is usually for the purpose of imitating the characters in the narrative.\nIt is part of performance\n<$A> In fact I'm reminded of a popular story my grandmother narrated to me some time back In this story Hare burns Elephant to death by pretending to make him shoes", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> We present the second of the eight programme s on oral literature for forms three and four In this programme we are going to discuss the performance of oral literature With me in the studio are the radio teacher and his two students Welcome to the programme \n<$B> Hello students Last week we discussed the stylistic aspects of oral narratives In that programme we mentioned briefly the role of performance in oral narratives Today we are going to discuss in detail the role of performance in oral literature and especially in the areas of oral narratives songs proverbs and riddles In particular we shall try to answer these questions One who undertakes these performances Two when and where are they performed Three who listens to them and four for what purposes are oral performances undertaken As we answer these questions we will inevitably discuss the roles of the oral artist and his audience in a live performance Let us start with the narratives <Name/> would you like to start us off by telling us who tells the stories\n<$D> Yes oral narratives are told and retold by anybody in the community men women children and even elders Anybody who can tell a story is asked to do so\n<$C> May I add that some people tell stories more dramatically than others Such narrators are recognised and appreciated by the community for their art They can therefore be regarded as professionals\n<$B> You are right In Kenya we have professional story tellers except that they are not paid for telling stories This is unlike in some parts of Africa especially West Africa where professional narrators travel from village to village telling stories and living off their art In some cases they are paid handsomely <name/> could you tell us who tells which stories\n<$D> The elders and a section of adults usually tell myths and legends This is because myths and legends contain abstract ideas that are not really for children On the other hand children usually enjoy telling folk tales especially trickster narratives and even within this class there are narratives that children enjoy telling each other most\n<$B> You are right <name/> Narratives are never told at random There is always selection Selection on the basis of subject matter and audience Elders tell narratives of a serious nature while others are left to relate those that are light hearted or humorous Let us now look at how narratives are told <Name/> take that\n<$C> In some communities people take turns to tell stories This is true of the Agikuyu Luhya Luo Meru and Akamba communities Amongst the Akamba people for example people sit in a circle and each one present tells a story in turns In such cases there is equal chance for everybody to tell a story\n<$B> Thank you <name/> If in such a situation one is not able to tell a story he or she is not highly regarded or rated Yes <name/> you have something to add\n<$D> In other communities the people just sit together in a group in an open field or ground and one person tells stories to the crowd\n<$B> That is true <name/> Story telling is seen as a communal and public activity Anyone tells a story at a social occasion Let us ask <name/> to tell us where the stories are told\n<$C> As we have already implied in the past in some communities stories were told on open grounds in the village where all people were gathered These open grounds however were not only reserved for story telling They were communal meeting places where most social activities took place In other communities these stories were told in houses where the various groups of people were gathered\n<$B> Correct <name/> Some stories are told in the grandmother's hut Others are told in huts where the boys or girls sleep or places where children are gathered\n<$C> We found out that amongst the Luo community the stories are told in <ea/><O/> where the boys sleep or <ea/><O/> where the girls sleep Here the girls or boys tell each other stories\n<$B> Let us now look at when stories are told <Name/> when are stories told and why are they told at that specific time\n<$D> As we mentioned earlier on stories are told in the evening In fact in most communities it is considered bad and even a taboo to tell a story during the day For example in some sections of the Abaluhya it is believed that if you tell stories during the day you will never grow tall Height is then seen as a mark of beauty\n<$C> And there is a reason for these kinds of beliefs myths if you like The community wants to discourage its members from sitting down and telling stories during the day while the daily chores are left unattended to\n<$B> You are right Stories are told in the evenings around seven or later and always after supper And it serves another good purpose In the evenings the people are idle and since the stories are often captivating they're a form of entertainment They serve the same purpose as our TVs videos films and music halls serve Now tell us to whom the stories are delivered\n<$D> In most communities women and children tell and will be told fictional stories\n<$B> And there is perfect logic in it Fictional oral narratives contain and present human affairs the daily exploits of human beings They also present human values In the traditional set-up women were the custodians of the community's values and beliefs So they have the duty to pass this on to their children No wonder the stories that carry such values have to be told to them What about the men and the boys Why do they have to be told legends and myths\n<$C> I will take that They have to be told legends because legends talk of wars migration and the general history of the community The myths contain religious material It must be remembered that traditionally the men are the custodians of the religious beliefs of the community It is also their duty to protect the society by participating in and propagating the history of the community No wonder they have to be told myths and legends which contain that information\n<$B> Correct <name/> Let us move on We have so far seen that oral narratives are told to the members of the community and are a form of entertainment I should add that in all communities in Kenya the story telling sessions are often looked forward to Could you tell us what makes the audience enjoy them <name/>\n<$D> Partly it is because of the content As we said earlier the themes and subjects treated are very interesting and relevant to our social life But perhaps what makes them extremely interesting and appealing is the art of story telling employed by the narrator\n<$B> What do you mean by that\n<$D> The narrator acts out the story He mimics the voices of the various characters as tradition sets For example if he's telling the story of a trickster he imitates the trickster Amongst the Luhya he lisps or stammers as he delivers the trickster's words He also delivers them in a shrill high pitched voice\n<$C> Besides this imitative speech the narrator will also act out several movements He waves his hands shakes or nods his head and mimes the various activities done by the characters in a story\n<$B> You are right The various facial expressions bodily movements tonal changes are used in the telling of the story Indeed the narrator is a dramatist and this often enhances the story and makes it appealing Let us now look at the oral artist When is a narrator pronounced an excellent narrator by the audience <name/> tell us\n<$C> A good narrator as we have suggested is one who dramatises the narrative effectively Secondly he is that one who renders the narrative according to the accepted format\n<$B> You are correct Every community has its own way of starting a story If you tell a story and you fail to use this formula then the community is not pleased So besides dramatisation a good narrator is one who can tell a story according to the accepted or known conventions in a given community Do you have anything else to add <name/>\n<$A> Yes a good narrator is one who knows the language well Such a person can tell a story fluently and display a wealth of vocabulary\n<$B> You are right A good narrator was and is one who has a rich language with a number of idioms proverbs and apt vocabulary You two have told us the role of the oral artist Can you tell us about the role the audience plays in an oral performance Yes <name/>\n<$C> The audience is as important as the narrator Often an audience is very active They are very attentive and are instrumental in making the performance either good or poor The audience is either an active or a passive audience The narrator looks at the audience as he narrates the story and if they show delight or interest he is encouraged to continue If they're passive then the narrator is inclined to cut the story short\n<$B> Both of you are correct The audience often decides on one the type of story to be selected two how it is to be told three when it is to end An audience can even decide on the length of the story telling session The audience is an integral part of story telling as their response inspires the oral artist But we must remember that performance is important not only in oral narratives but also in other forms of oral literature such as songs recitations and riddles and proverbs Now <name/> can you tell us about songs when where and by whom they are performed\n<$C> Songs are always performed on specific occasions Such occasions may be ceremonies feasts celebrations initiation birth marriage victory funerals or even at work Children also sing as they play\n<$D> Songs are sung by a special group or an individual or by anybody gathered in the place where the event is taking place It all depends on the occasion\n<$B> The occasion plays a very important role in the performance of a song It decides the kind of song to be sung and it even determines the kind of singing to be done If for example the occasion is a sad one than the songs with a sad mood would prevail Or still if the singers are well treated by their host they sing many songs with happiness and in  the> praise of their host On the contrary if they are disappointed their songs may be full of abuse or insult The environment enhances the song Besides the occasion what other items are used to enhance the song\n<$D> There are also other things like musical instruments the singers' costumes and even their ululations that enhance the singing\n<$B> You are right The song is often sung with accompaniment Usually the song is sung with plenty of dancing In some cases a song may be dramatised. The beauty of a song therefore does not only depend on the words but also on these other aspects of a song. They play a great part in either making the song beautiful or more meaningful <Name/> would you like to tell us something on who performs songs\n<$C> Songs can be performed by either a group or an individual Let me add that like narratives a song is often a communal activity Songs are sung by anybody but there are people that are recognised as good singers Such people are showered with gifts during the singing although these gifts are never looked at as payment\n<$B> Thank you When is a singer considered a good singer\n<$D> This recognition is often accorded to soloists A soloist is considered a good singer if his voice is clear and if he sings with confidence When a singer does this his song becomes interesting and even moves the audience into some activity like dancing or ululating", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'cea2cdd1-0b2b-427a-b901-102b4d989d6b', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.013242+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9762575030326843, 'non_english_score': 0.023742496967315674}
{'text': "<$A> We present the work of school guidance counsellors for all our listeners and especially to the teacher counsellors\n<$A> Today we are beginning a series of eight discussions about the work of school guidance counsellors This series has been prepared by the guidance and counselling section of the Ministry of Education Science and Technology for teacher counsellors and the general public in the hope that they will understand the sincere interest of the ministry in providing services which will help students make the best possible use of their education opportunities and which will help them find a job that will prove both self-fulfilling and of value to Kenya and the world of which we are part\n<$B> Our students are making good use of the educational opportunities in so far as they understand what education is all about Most of them are taking the education that will lead to exam success and opportunities for higher education or employment seriously But education in our rapidly changing world means far more than passing examinations and finding employment\n<$A> You are right In the first place education means gaining an understanding of the forces at work in a developing society of our dependence on each other of our relationships with other nations of our use of natural resources and so on For example as we learn the great value of our forested areas in bringing the rainfall that is so essential to the production of food can we justify the continued use of charcoal for fuel\n<$B> Surely it is understanding of things such as these rather than the mere accumulation of facts that brings about desired changes in a society Thus education means developing new appreciations Do we appreciate people and the work they do From the artist who so sensitively captures in a wood carving the wonder of a child he has observed to the aged mother who still tends her <ea/>shamba or her children exploring new patterns of city living Do we truly value a heritage that has made us dependent on close family ties and traditions for support as we move in a changing society Are we appreciative of the fact that other cultures around us who are also needing support may find it in other values than our own Yes it is appreciations of the natural world around us of people of their work of our heritage of the rich and varied cultures that surround us such appreciation gives depth and meaning to education\n<$A> Education also means changing our attitudes too about work for we must understand that all labour which helps people to live happier and healthier lives is important and no contribution toward that end may be regarded as insignificant or unworthy Do we regard the person who does a conscientious job of keeping our streets and public places clean less important in maintaining a healthy neighbourhood than a doctor or nurse Perhaps we need to change our attitude about people not all of whom are alike but all of whom experience the same emotional desires frustrations and joys And what about our attitude toward change itself Can we adapt to a rapidly changing world Do we hang on to old traditions just because they're old or do we reach out for new patterns just because they're new\n<$B> Yes these are the concepts which must make up what we call education Understanding appreciations and positive attitudes are vital to any constructive use of knowledge We must never allow our concept of education to be limited to acquiring knowledge Having understood what education means then we can readily see areas in which students need help in sorting out the vast stores of information in finding stability in rapidly changing world and in focusing on their places in the stream of life\n<$A> Too often students do not know how their educational experiences relate to the work they will be doing later in life They really do not know themselves very well what they want to do or what they're capable of doing Often they are confronted with learning problems or social or personal problems which may retard or impair their developmental learning and progress These needs of students have not been adequately met in our schools There have been a few lucky students who have received guidance from their teachers This was possible especially in missionary and boarding schools But earlier the proportion of teachers to students was more favourable than it is now Today our teachers have very heavy teaching loads and hardly any time to deal with students' needs\n<$B> And yet this help this guidance must be provided by our schools. The school is the largest child and youth service agency It is the school that has been entrusted with the responsibility for the intellectual and social development of our children and young people Moreover there are so many things to know and so many changes in the way we live and work that it takes many people working together to provide the information and help which these students need before they can make wise decisions about their future And it is during this period in a young person's life when he is most interested in learning about the adult world toward which he is moving Surely the school has or can obtain more resources than any other institution to facilitate that learning\n<$A> This is what the Ministry of Education believes Several years ago they made some very wise observations They realised that in a modern and rapidly expanding educational system it is natural that primary attention is focused on developing new curricula and new teaching methods on organising new programme s and financing new projects But while all these expansion and development is taking place to provide opportunities for the young people to prepare for and to assume responsible positions in society and to more fully understand and appreciate the world in which we live we may well be defeating ourselves by losing sight of the student in the system\n<$B> You're so right We are producing syllabi which are relevant to the further educational needs and the employmental requirements of our students We are developing teaching formats which motivate the average student to give his best effort to learning We're providing modern laboratories and libraries to support the efforts of both students and teachers These are all worthy achievements and should be encouraged But what if the student is unable to take advantage of all these assets\n<$A> That is the point Consider the student who has personal problems that dominate his attention For example consider the boy whose concern is for a <O/> and overworked mother who has put in several hours of work at home before coming to school and whose only interest during school hours is the responsibilities awaiting him when he returns home Is he in a position to take advantage of relevant syllabi or modern laboratories or think of the student who has come to think of himself as a failure in whatever he undertakes Is he in a position to make the best use of the educational resources around him\n<$B> Certainly uh first of all we must consider the student learning to handle personal problems to understand one's capacities and limitations to arrange priorities to make decisions These are all important attributes for the student who is to make the best use of his educational opportunities Besides he needs to know the relationship of his current studies to the employment he may later seek and he surely needs to know the variety of work opportunities that may be open to him\n<$A> These are all vitally important considerations for secondary school students And somebody has got to see that they have a chance to explore them This is where the idea of a guidance and counselling programme comes into the picture You see guidance as a continuing process one that is concerned with the developmental needs of all students To be effective it must be a systematically planned programme focused on helping young people to understand themselves and their relationship to the world in which they live and to that adult world toward which they are rapidly moving Do you think people especially the students recognise the importance of guidance and counselling\n<$B> No I'm afraid a lot of folks have never heard of guidance and counselling much less recognised its importance But the Ministry of Education has recognised it and so they have established the guidance and counselling unit This unit has been charged with the responsibility of keeping the student and his needs in the central position in the educational system in Kenya We will hear a great deal more about the guidance and counselling unit and how it is functioning in this series of broadcasts But uh let's talk for a few minutes about some very special people in our public schools There are and always have been some teachers who truly believe that their students are the most important part of the school It is gratifying that they are able to give as much time as some of them do to helping students\n<$A> You are right In most schools teachers are teaching twenty-eight to thirty-two out of forty periods per week with thirty-eight to forty students in every class In addition to their teaching responsibilities many of them are carrying additional loads as subject heads class heads or housemasters and there are also extra-curricular responsibilities in the form of sports dramatics and club activities Along with these demanding and important uses of their time some teachers truly concerned about the students' ability to take full advantage of the school programme are willing to assume counselling duties and are doing their best to make time in their crowded schedules to do this Often the busiest teachers are the ones who find some free time to help students\n<$B> These teachers would like to meet for a weekly period with form one students to help them adapt to the new school and to become aware of the relationship of the work they do there to their future studies and job opportunities But there is probably no free period in the timetable for such a meeting The want meet with form two students either as a group or individually to be sure they have made the psychological and sociological adjustments that will help them derive the greatest benefit from their schooling and be sure they understand the importance of making wise curriculum choices in form three\n<$A> And in forms three and four they want to help them develop an awareness of the world of work that lies ahead by bringing in visitors who can describe a variety of occupations by listening to career tapes prepared by the education media service by making visits to businesses and industries by making available to them written materials describing job and training opportunities and by advising them about opportunities for higher education leading to professional careers How can students make intelligent choices if they're denied this kind of assistance\n<$B> But how can this kind of assistance be made available to them if concerned teachers are not granted time and space for such a programme Unfortunately in many of our schools the only assistance students receive is at the time they complete their career's forms in form four And that is a process that needs to be based on a broad understanding of one's interests and capacities and a realistic assessment of opportunities but which is too often attempted without this understanding What is the answer Is it possible that a teacher be assigned to every school whose only responsibility is guidance and counselling\n<$A> No that might be the ideal answer but it is not a practical one at this time In the first place we still do not have enough teachers for our secondary schools In the second place Kenya has very few teachers who are prepared to be full-time guidance counsellors But we have made a good start in the right direction", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '4a3ce58e-519a-424e-8515-d5504f0c5b6f', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.014211+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9790889620780945,

{'text': "<$A> We present the work of school guidance counsellors for all our listeners and especially to the teacher counsellors\n<$A> Programme two The essentials for good guidance and counselling\n<$B> Last week we talked of the meaning of guidance and counselling and of the student's need for this kind of assistance We recognised that the student must be at the centre of our thinking as we plan and operate our educational system For the whole system can be justified only if it is serving the needs of students\n<$A> Today we shall consider the essential elements for the establishment of a good guidance and counselling programme in a given school I guess I would list in order of importance first a concerned and competent headmaster or headmistress second a concerned and competent teacher counsellor third supportive staff relationships and fourth adequate facilities in time and space\n<$B> Surely uh the headmaster should be at the top of the list for that person carries the ultimate responsibility for the programme and is directly responsible for finding the right person to assume the counselling concerns Without a headmaster who is committed to placing the student and his needs above all other school considerations it is pretty hard for a teacher to set up a meaningful programme \n<$A> Such commitment means facing up to the kinds of situations that will arise once the guidance and counselling programme is started For example will the headmaster agree to support his teacher counsellor in finding three or four periods in the timetable so that more responsible consideration will be given to the completion of the careers' forms than was possible last year or another example in the face of the criticism of the mathematics teacher who disapproves of the teacher counsellor keeping some out of class will the headmaster agree that one or more individual counselling sessions with this frustrated student are important in his adjustment to the new school\n<$B> Yes commitment is more than a fine sounding word It is courage to stand for what you believe is most important even when it means changes that some of your colleagues won't understand It is patience in interpreting the values on which your decisions are based\n<$A> It is true that the headmaster's influence governs all aspects of the school He may delegate many responsibilities to other members of the staff but he must remain in close touch with their activities and if a guidance and counselling programme is to be successful it must have the head's unqualified support\n<$B> As the chief administrative officer of the school it is his business to know his staff well enough to be able to pick the right people for special appointments Surely he should have the judgement needed to choose a counsellor and to help him or her establish the required relationships with the rest of the staff\n<$A> One other reason why a concerned and competent head is so essential to the programme is because he carries final responsibility for determining the counsellor's teaching and extra-curricular loads For setting up the school timetable and allocating classroom space time and space are among the essential elements and the school head controls at them\n<$B> Sometimes a headmaster assumes the role of counsellor himself Do you think that is a good idea\n<$A> No not if someone else that is a concerned and competent person is available because no matter how concerned and competent the head may be we must remember his first responsibility must be to the administration of the whole school programme He simply cannot give the students the personal attention that they should have but he can so administer the total programme that they do occupy that central place in it and he can give full support to the member of the staff chosen to work as the counsellor\n<$B> The teacher counsellor is the second essential element we've mentioned in our list of requirements for a good guidance and counselling programme Let us consider the kind of a person the head looks for for this special responsibility and it is a special responsibility And the appointment of the teacher counsellor is one of the most important decisions a school head makes The foremost qualification of such a person is of course his sincere interest in each student's development as a person and his commitment to a programme that will provide the conditions for that development\n<$A> Right No teacher should be asked to assume the role of counsellor unless he is so dedicated He or she needs to be a warm outgoing person who can inspire the confidence of students and the support of fellow staff members because he will undoubtedly be consulting at times with parents and others in the community He will serve as a public relations  person interpreting the true meaning of education and the school's concern for the well-being of each student\n<$B> And he will need initiative for in most situations the guidance programme has not been developed to serve in all the areas that it should He will need organisational ability to establish priorities for there will be many and varied demands on his time and of course he will need to be a person of mature judgement\n<$A> It sounds as if the teacher counsellor must be some kind of superperson and of course that is exactly what he or she is Fortunately such people do exist They have been teaching in our schools since the very beginning and they are there now They wait to be identified to be recognised for the service they're giving and to be encouraged to develop the full scope of guidance and counselling services in our schools\n<$B> We should talk a bit about supportive staff relationships One may ask the question If a school has a headmaster or headmistress and a teacher counsellor both of whom are dedicated to a viable guidance and counselling programme do the rest of the school staff need to participate in it Of course they do Every staff member who comes in contact with the student asserts a positive or negative influence on his life Whether they recognise it or not they are helping or hindering that student's development toward responsible maturity Of course it is the purpose of the school that these contacts should be positive\n<$A> Yes at the same time these staff members are in positions to make many observations which are denied to the head and the teacher counsellor The class teacher meets his students briefly every day and observes their changing attitudes The house master gets to know them in their informal hours The sports master sees them under stress and understands their frustrations and joys The subject teacher is aware of their determination to succeed or conversely of their disinterest All these people are needed to support the guidance and counselling programme \n<$B> Actually the headmaster and the teacher counsellor are the co-ordinators of the programme Surely they will have personal contact with all students as far as time will allow but they must depend on the support and assistance of all other staff members in helping them know the students and understand their needs\n<$A> True the guidance and counselling effort to be successful must be a team effort and this fact adds emphasis to the importance of choosing as the teacher counsellor a person who can inspire the rest of the staff to take an active interest in the programme \n<$B> And what about the essential element in a good guidance and counselling programme adequate facilities in time and space Generally finding space for the programme does not present the challenge but finding time for it does But uh it must be thought about One essential requirement is for a place where a counsellor and student can talk together without distraction This might be in the counsellor's classroom during periods when it is not in use or in a small office at a time when it is not occupied It might be in a corner of the school library or in the chapel at hours when they're not in use It might be in an area of the school grounds where there is little traffic The actual place is not important as is the sense of security that the student must have in knowing that he is speaking with an advisor who respects his confidence In many instances this means that he will want assurance that he's not being observed or overheard by other students or staff members It is most helpful if such meeting place is available at specified hours\n<$A> A counsellor needs a space to keep reference materials professionally oriented materials that will help him grow in his understanding of his new responsibilities educational and vocational reference materials for his own use but especially for the use of students as they learn to search out information they need and books and pamphlets which challenge the imagination of students as they think ahead to new roles they will play in society Again where this space is is not as important as that there is space It may be on certain marked shelves in the library it may be in a cupboard or on a shelf in the counsellor's classroom Hopefully it will be where a student will have easy access to it and where a reading table and chair will permit him to study it and take notes from it\n<$B> Sometimes a greater amount of space is needed For example a speaker comes to talk to form four students about employment in a particular industry or a group of students want to listen to several career tapes from the educational media service or form one students as a group need some help in learning how to adjust to new school situations Usually these kinds of group meetings will be scheduled far enough in advance so that a vacant classroom or an empty assembly hall may be utilised\n<$A> Very few schools have surplus space to be allocated solely the purposes of the guidance and counselling programme But for the teacher counsellor who is well organised and plans ahead and who has a supporting headmaster the problem of space is not one that seriously hinders the programme But what about the problem of time\n<$B> That is the real problem As the shape of the desired programme evolves the head master and the teacher counsellor will need to face the hard facts of allocating time for it within the teacher counsellor's twenty-four-hour day and within the school timetable Every school is hard-pressed to set up a realistic timetable which will allow for a well-balanced education with a minimum number of teachers Making room for a sound counselling programme within this framework will be a true test of the school's commitment to it\n<$A> If a teacher is to take on the additional counselling responsibility he or she must have an adjustment in his class and extra-curricular loads to make room for it He needs time to decide what phases of the guidance programme are to have priority He needs time to organise his pattern of work He needs time for discussing with the headmaster and for establishing staff relationships\n<$B> And that is all in preparation for the actual programme itself Meeting with the students in groups and individually is the heart of the guidance and counselling programme And time for it must be recognised in the school timetable This is a very critical point The point at which many proposed guidance and counselling programme s fail and eventually die The Ministry of Education the chief inspector of schools the headmaster and the staff may all believe in the guidance and counselling programme but they must believe it is fully as important as the required classes in English science or agriculture They must plan time for it in the school timetable just as they do for the required subjects I repeat The failure of the school system to plan time for guidance and counselling means the failure of this vital programme", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$A> We present an introduction to East African Poetry by Jonathon Karere and Alan Kitonga This programme is for forms three and four \n<$B> Yet Another Song Yet another song I have to sing In the early wake of a colonial dark I sang the song of fire The church doors opened to the clang of new anthems and colours of banners Like the Beatles the evangelical hymns of conversion rocked the world and me I knelt before the new totems and helped to raise watered them with tears of ecstasy They grew taller than life grimacing and breathing fire Today I sing yet another song a song of exile \n<$A> This is the first of the eight programme s on an introduction to East African Poetry by Jonathon Karere and Alan Kitonga In our first two programme s we shall try to give you a general reference to the terminology used in poetic analysis by giving you a simple guide to prosody Prosody is the study of the technical and formal aspects of poetry such as metre rhyme rhythm verse and so on This prosody section will give you a sufficient understanding of the nature and variety of poetry It will also give you some reasonable means for reading poetry with appreciative understanding and a few primary ideas of how to evaluate poetry We shall also try to introduce to you some elements of poetry putting the emphasis always on how and why For example how does a general understanding of these elements help the reader to appreciate fully the meaning of a particular poem to interpret it correctly and respond to it adequately Why does the poet use these elements What values have they for the poet and the reader It is our assumption therefore that our first two programme s will give the students beginning poetry something they can understand and use in their poetry lessons \n<$B> Poetry like any language is used all over the world as a means of communication As a means of communication poetry has no limit It has been used by both the most primitive and the most advanced and civilised peoples of the world It is therefore not quite right to think that poetry is only read and studied in schools only Poetry has appealed to the educated the intelligent and the sensitive people as well as to the uneducated and above all to the children You may ask yourself why is it that poetry appeals to nearly all sorts of people The answer is simple Firstly poetry gives pleasure People have read it or listened to it or recited it because they liked it and it gave them enjoyment \n<$C> Secondly poetry has been regarded as something central to each man's existence something giving unique value to the fully realised life something that one is better off for having and spiritually impoverished without Having said that much can you attempt a definition of poetry What is poetry Poetry can be defined as a way of using language not only to say more but also to say it more intensely than in the ordinary way The difference between ordinary language and poetry is very simple to understand Ordinary language is used to communicate in the practical sense For example we can say that it is raining outside because we can see it or hear it or even feel it but the language of literature as found in poems plays and novels tries to communicate human experience in a significant and striking way This is so because it is carefully and deliberately concentrated and organised Thus the function of literature is not to tell us about experience but to allow us imaginatively to participate in it by means of broadening or deepening our experience \n<$A> Suppose the word flywhisk was not familiar to you and that you wanted to find its meaning a good dictionary would give you this definition about a flywhisk \n<$B> A device that consists of a bundle of flexible fibres mounted in a handle that is used primarily to brush away flies and that has often served as a symbol of high position or authority \n<$A> Unless you are only interested in this information for your academic purposes you would miss the real meaning of the word flywhisk It is true that a flywhisk is used to drive away flies and as a symbol of power But the definition does not give us the significant effects and experience of using a flywhisk Compare and contrast the above definition about a flywhisk with John Ruganda's poem The Flywhisk on page sixty one \n<$B> The Flywhisk Fling it sharply and growl Rebels hide their heads Wave it gently and smile Flies flit from pus-drooping eyes Sling it on the arm finally Empty stomachs will drum for you \n<$A> Notice the three different ways of using a flywhisk giving three different ways of satisfaction fling it wave it and sling it Giving the effects of command respect and assurance respectively In this poem John Ruganda not only tells us what a flywhisk is and its uses but also invites us to experience the significance of using the flywhisk in different ways giving us different effects By the end of the poem we not only know the meaning of the flywhisk but also our experience on its uses and its effects have been broadened \n<$C> Poetry deals with the whole life and not part of it Its primary concern is not with beauty or philosophical truth or with persuasion but with experience Beauty and philosophical truth are aspects of experience and the poet is often engaged with them The experience might be beautiful or ugly strange or common noble or ignoble actual or imaginary What might be painful in real life might be enjoyable in poetry Therefore the reader of poetry must involve not only his intelligence but also his senses emotions and imagination \n<$A> Poetry unlike ordinary language achieves its extra dimensions in communication by drawing more fully and more consistently on a number of language resources Some of these resources include the following connotation connotation imagery imagery metaphor metaphor rhythm rhythm and pattern pattern By using these resources and the materials of life the poet is capable of shaping and making his poem \n<$B> This brings us to the art of reading a poem to understand and appreciate it Here are a few hints Number one Read a poem more than once so as to understand its full meaning Do not expect to understand or appreciate a poem after a first reading Number two Keep a good dictionary by you and use it to find out the meaning of words and expressions you are not familiar with But this should be done only after you have read the poem right through carefully Number three It is often helpful to read poetry aloud Poetry is written to be heard Its meanings are conveyed through sound as well as through print Every word is therefore important Poems should be read as slowly as possible Number four Always pay careful attention to what the poem is saying One should make the utmost effort to follow the thought continuously and to grasp the full implications and suggestions Lastly be alert to the effects a poet may wish to create by use of repetition of the sound \n<$B> To aid us in the understanding of a poem we may ask ourselves a number of questions about it One Who is the speaker It is wrong to assume that the speaker is the poet himself You would be safe to assume that the speaker is someone other than the poet himself Number two What is the occasion Number three What is the central purpose of the poem The purpose of the poem may be to tell a story to reveal human character to impart a vivid impression of a scene to express a mood or an emotion or to convey to us vividly some idea or attitude Whatever the purpose is we must determine it for ourselves and define it mentally as precisely as possible And lastly once we have known the central purpose of the poem we next consider the question by what means is the purpose achieved \n<$C> Let us try to apply the above four questions to Kariara's poem Grass Will Grow on page ninety six \n<$B> Grass will grow If you should take my child Lord give my hands strength to dig his grave cover him with earth Lord send a little rain for grass will grow If my house should burn down so that the ashes sting the nostrils making the eyes weep then lord send a little rain for grass will grow But Lord do not send me madness I ask for tears Do not send me moon-hard madness to lodge snug in my scull I would you send me hordes of horses galloping crushing but do not break the yolk of the moon on me \n<$C> In this poem the speaker is a father who is also head of his household The occasion is his moment of prayer to his god During this occasion he considers the possibility of a number of things happening to him like death of his child his house burning down Consequently he demands to be given strength to bury his child that the rain may fall to enable a new growth of grass We know that the speaker is talking to God because of his calm and resigned tone \n<$A> The central purpose of the poem is quite clear The speaker prefers loss and suffering to madness which portrays the speaker's emotions \n<$B> But Lord do not send me madness I ask for tears Do not send me moon-hard madness <$A> The speaker would rather have his child dying or his house burning down because he would sooner or later forget and start afresh for grass will grow than getting madness that would lodge snug in his scull \n<$C> The final question by what means is a purpose of the poem achieved is partially answered by describing the poem's framework The rest requires an accounting of various resources of communication as seen in Kariara's poem Grass Will Grow The purpose of the poem is achieved by dramatic possibilities of the speaker's losses at the beginning of the first and the second stanzas In the final stanza the speaker uses natural images moon-hard madness and the yolk of the moon which represents the insanity he doesn't want Suffering is represented by natural images such as hordes of horses galloping or even crushing \n<$A> Finally we shall give you a list of questions that you may apply to any poem in the course of your study in poetry We have listed down twelve and I'll start from the first Number one Who is the speaker What kind of person is he Number two To whom is he speaking What kind of person is he Number three What is the occasion Number four What is the setting in time and place time and place Number five What is the central purpose of the poem Number six What is the tone of the poem tone of the poem and how is it achieved Number seven Discuss the imagery of the poem What kind of imagery is used Number eight Point out examples of a metaphor simile personification and explain their appropriateness metaphor simile personification and explain their appropriateness Number nine Point out and explain any symbols symbols Number ten Point out and explain examples of paradox overstatement understatement and irony What is their function Eleven Point out significant examples of sound repetition and explain their function Lastly with these points considered you may be in a position to appreciate and evaluate a poem but above all be able to really enjoy it \n<$A> In this programme we discussed what is poetry and the art of reading a poem to understand and appreciate it Next week we shall discuss the elements of poetry This programme was written and produced by <name/> and recorded by <name/>", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source':

{'text': "<$A> We present professional studies for untrained teachers Today we ask What is child-centred education In our last programme we talked about traditional education We said that traditional education was geared to preparing a child for life in his own community The activities for the child were carefully selected In our programme today we are going to examine ideas that have developed over many years on child-centred education\n<$B> On this programme we shall learn one what child-centred education is two the role of the teacher in child-centred learning and three the kind of activities you can organise in your class to make it child-centred \n<$A> Child-centred education may be best defined as a realistic response to what we know about children their development interests and characteristics \n<$B> Child-centred education developed from the ideas put forward by educational philosophers and psychologists who realised that children develop at different rates physically mentally emotionally and socially for example the physical skill and co-ordination necessary to write legibly is attained by some children at the age of four but not by others until the age of eight\n<$A> You already know that children are not simply little adults and that they progress through various stages of development as they grow up You also know that the characteristics they display change during the process of growing up so do their interests and the forces that motivate them Child-centred education therefore attempts to satisfy these needs and assists children who are undergoing these changes \n<$B> Furthermore child-centred education or learning tries to acknowledge that children's needs should determine what is learnt at school This does not mean however that children control what goes on in the school It means that you and the children in your class are like partners You the teacher play the role of the class leader You've come to appreciate that every child is an individual developing at his own rate and differing in needs abilities interests cultural influence and behaviour These differences must therefore be taken into account when deciding on teaching methods activities and evaluative techniques\n<$A> Child-centred education or child-centred learning tries to recognise and respond to the changing characteristics that distinguish children of different ages This is a reason why we organise activity lessons in the lower primary classes and discovery lessons in the upper primary classes Again teachers think of the different exercises that are done in physical education lessons in standard two Are they the same for a standard seven child No they are not and once again the reason is that as children grow and develop their interests and abilities change\n<$B> Child-centred education also tries to select what is taught and the methods used so that they are appropriate to the understanding and experiences of the children The entire idea of curriculum development accounts for these For example in mathematics you cannot teach children how to multiply before you have told them how to add Likewise you cannot teach them how to read before they have acquired a working or sight vocabulary \n<$A> In addition to teaching children what is appropriate to the understanding and experience child-centred education or learning trains children in skills that are within the capabilities of their stage of development For example the basic skills of reading and writing are learnt in contexts which are meaningful to the children instead of learning the rules of number by memorisation like the multiplication tables they do so by perhaps having a market in the classroom were prices for goods are displayed quantities are weighed costs are calculated money is paid and change is given This is learning by doing \n<$B> In these ways teachers children have plenty of opportunities for creative work and self-expression Moreover each child is actively involved in his own learning Child-centred education fosters a sense of responsibility in each child by enabling the child to learn how to act as a leader and make decisions\n<$A> Teachers I now want to describe a classroom where child-centred learning or education is taking place First of all the classroom should be a relaxed and happy place where there is plenty opportunity for learning There are should be many interesting learning areas in the classroom for example projects displays science or nature areas discovery tables book corners or library areas activity areas such as the market or shop and creativity corners\n<$B> As you have just heard the classroom is a place where children eagerly look forward to coming to one You need to take the role of leader in the class by providing all of these different learning opportunities and two you need to have a large pool of local resources and materials readily available at all times This means that once you have a nature table in your classroom you should maintain it regularly by changing the items on it frequently to reflect what you are teaching \n<$A> In the child-centred classroom you will also notice that there are a lot of playthings for children and that they have a good deal of choice over what they do at any particular time though this does not mean children do as they please They are free however to move around the classroom if they need too You may find some children are working quietly on their own *alternativity> while others are working together in a group on something different No one is bored Everyone is involved in his own learning \n<$B> Some are telling other groups of children about something they have just discovered or explaining a difficult problem in an assignment Some may be writing about things they have seen while others are painting pictures or making models Yet others may be taking care of the class or cleaning and changing the nature corner \n<$A> From the description of a child-centred learning classroom you can see teachers that learning is taking place all the time some of it directly from the teacher or through the activities and some of it indirectly from the classrooms surroundings Children do not have to wait for you to attend to them nor do they have to sit still if they finish their work before their friends for there are so many other things for them to do \n<$B> Let us now think about how you organise a child-centred learning situation and what your role in such a learning situation is First of all teachers you need to be flexible and accept the fact that children learn best and are happy when they are actively involved in their own learning This simple means that you should not expect children to sit at their desks hour after hour being taught You should expect them to be involved in learning activity in one of the learning areas in the classroom and then move on to another learning activity \n<$A> You will therefore need to arrange your classroom in a way which can accommodate children to move freely without disrupting or disturbing other children \n<$B> In organising a child-centred learning situation or classroom you also need to have a flexible timetable One each child can develop his own interests at his own rate of progress Two you teach skill subjects such as reading number work history science geography and others and three you organise socially stimulating learning experiences such as story telling music drama and physical education \n<$A> One other very important learning experience which you can organise in your class is the activity programme The activity programme is the core of child-centred learning Remember teachers a child learns best by doing and finds interest and enjoyment in activity Therefore a child must be given every opportunity to discover explore and find out for himself by touching feeling and handling a variety of objects \n<$B> The activity programme makes use of all the senses The more senses that are used in acquiring learning the deeper the impression that is made on the mind of the learner and the more certain we are that the learning will be retained Here are some activities you can organise for children at different stages in the primary school Listen carefully to them and decide which ones are appropriate for the children in your class \n<$A> Thinking listening touching watching discussing playing reading drawing writing exploring experimenting collecting sorting and classifying \n<$B> Teachers every one of the activities just mentioned can be used in a child-centred learning situation At the end of this programme you should prepare a list of activities you can use in your classroom \n<$A> Let's recall here teachers that activity ensures learning through doing and that a child learns best when he is actively involved in his own learning Furthermore pupil activity does the following one adds interest and enjoyment to a lesson and does away with passivity and boredom two reinforces and revises what is being taught three helps to develop a good pupil teacher relationship four Encourages initiative creativity and curiosity and five develops or improves basic skills such as reading writing number work and others\n<$B> Teachers there are two very essential points to keep in mind if the activity programme and indeed child-centred learning is to be successful These are first class discipline Child-centred learning does not mean allowing children total freedom This would lead to chaos and a breakdown of class discipline This would result in little or no learning taking place It is extremely important for you to maintain class control at all times by telling children what is expected of them and how they should behave in the class This will help the child to become honest to himself polite obedient and attentive It will also help him to be responsible to himself and others as well as teaching him to work on his own or with others \n<$A> The second point you need to keep in mind if child-centred learning is to be successful is the fact that you must know every child in your class as an individuum This means you must know his strengths and weaknesses his likes and dislikes and his abilities and interests By knowing all this information about each child you can plan and supervise suitable learning experiences for your class \n<$B> Teachers let us summarise the main points of today's programme on child-centred education or child-centred learning Child-centred education is defined as a realistic response to what we know about children their development interests and characteristics \n<$A> Secondly teachers we briefly describe a classroom where child-centred learning takes place Such a classroom has a relaxed to friendly atmosphere where there is more pupil activity than teacher activity There is also a tremendous variety of activity taking place at any one time \n<$B> Thirdly teachers you heard how you can organise child-centred learning in your classroom This means being flexible both in terms of classroom arrangement and time-tabling This will enable you to develop a strong and varied activity programme \n<$A> Last but not least you heard how a good or successful teacher must know each child in his class as an individual and must be able to be maintain good class discipline if child centred learning is to be successful \n<$B> Teachers that is all for today In our next programme we shall hear about some of the educational philosophers who contributed to the ideas of child-centred education This programme was written by <name/> and produced by <name/> for educational media service Kenya Institute of Education Until next time good day teachers \n\n<$A> We present professional studies for untrained teachers Our radio lesson today is about child-centred education and some of the most famous educational philosophers who contributed to the ideas of child-centred education Today we shall discuss ideas of Plato Comenius Rousseau and Pestalozzi and how these ideas are applicable to our education today \n<$B> Before we introduce you to some of these famous men let us fast recall what you heard in our previous lesson about child-centred education Child-centred education was defined as a realistic response to what we know about children their development interests and characteristics \n<$C> Secondly teachers a classroom where child-centred methods are used was described You can remember that this meant having many and varied

{'text': "<$A> We present an introduction to East African Poetry by Jonathon Karere and Alan Kitonga This programme is for forms three and four \n<$A> This is the second of the eight programme s on an introduction to East African Poetry by Jonathon Karere and Alan Kitonga Before we introduce today's topic we shall first of all revise what we discussed last week In our last programme we said One Poetry appeals to all sorts of people because it gives them pleasure and enjoyment Two Poetry differs from ordinary language in that unlike ordinary language that communicates practical experience poetry communicates significant experience which is concentrated and organised We also suggested some hints to you that can be applied to any poem so as to help you understand and appreciate the poem This week we shall discuss the elements of poetry In this programme we shall try to discuss some primary poetic elements that give problems to some students I feel these elements include the following One What use in literary setting or denotations and connotations of words What use in literary setting or denotations and connotations of words Two Imagery Imagery and three Figurative language Figurative language \n<$B> Let us start our discussion by examining word use in poetry You should realise that a poet does not choose his words aimlessly A good poet chooses his words with great care and you should be alert to notice their full significance In poetry the average word has three component parts These are One Sound Sound Two Denotations Denotations Three Connotations Connotations The literal dictionary meaning of a word is its denotation The connotation of a word is what the word suggests beyond what it expresses its overtones of meaning \n<$C> For example the word home by denotation means a place where one lives but by connotation the word home suggests security love comfort and family Your first problem in reading poetry is to try to develop a sense of language and a feeling for words This can only be overcome by extensive use of the dictionary and extensive reading In Kariara's poem Grass Will Grow the speaker asks for tears which by connotation means weeping mourning suffering loss sadness grief and so on instead of being given madness which according to him is a more severe punishment as compared to tears \n<$A> Another important tool of uh poetry is imagery Imagery may be defined as the representation through language of sense experience Poetry appeals directly to our senses though of course its music and rhythm does the same too and this is what actually what we hear when it is read aloud But indirectly poetry appeals to our senses through imagery which is the representation to the imagination of sense experience When we speak of an image we normally think of a mental picture which is in our mind's eye This visual imagery is common in poetry You must note that an image may also represent a sound a smell a taste a tactile experience for example like hardness wetness or cold An image may also represent any internal sensation such as hunger thirst or nausea or movement or tension in the muscles or joints \n<$C> Jonathan Kariara's poem The Boat is about death The speaker laments the death of a very important and a powerful member of parliament Due to the death of this minister the speaker seems to be quite helpless lonely and very bitter He has lost his sense of direction because he has no leader He seems to have no strength for anything else except to mourn his departed minister He sees the death of the minister as a bringer of shame and wanton destruction But the poet does not tell us these things directly In fact he does not use the word death in his poem His concern is to communicate experience and not information He does this by creating images that represent death and sorrow The siren of the ambulance creates an image of danger and most likely death in our minds Cold wind represents death and solitude Listen to the following conversation of two friends whereby one has just come in out of a rain storm \n<$D> Oh come in please You are a pretty sight Got slightly wet did you \n<$E> wet I'm drowned It's raining cats and dogs outside and my raincoat's just like a sieve \n<$C> It is likely that the two friends understand each other pretty well but if you examine their conversation literally that is to say unimaginatively you will find that they have been speaking nonsense Actually they have been speaking figuratively They have been saying less than what they mean or more than what they mean or the opposite of what they mean or something else other than what they actually mean By using figures of speech we can say what we want to say more vividly and forcefully than saying it directly A figure of speech can simply be defined as a way of saying one thing and meaning another \n<$A> The commonly used figures of speech include the following metaphor personification symbol overstatement understatement and irony We shall give you a brief definition and examples of each of the figures of speech mentioned earlier To begin with metaphor and simile These are comparisons between things which are unlike The only distinction is that in simile the comparison is expressed that is stated by the use of some word or phrase such as like as than similar to or resembles For example Barak Omondi's poem Luo Dancer on page eleven opens with a comparison of the onlooker to an opium addict It goes Like an opium addict you watch her red-eyed In the last stanza the poet uses another striking simile to show the onlooker's inability to act by comparing him to a castrated bull The line goes as follows Like a castrated bull you stare at her and her man In metaphor the comparison is implied that is the figurative term is substituted for or identified with the literal term For example when Okoth Ogendo in his poem The Dancing Maniac the fifth stanza on page thirteen writes that I will let loose this caged spirit upon you he is using a metaphor for he identifies his caged spirit which gives animal-like qualities with his great desire for the woman he is inviting for the dance This brings us to another element of poetry personification Personification consists of giving the attributes of human being to an animal an object or an idea Personification is a kind of metaphor an implied comparison in which the figurative term of the comparison is always a human being \n<$C> For example when Charles Owore in his poem The Bond on page one hundred and twenty writes he shook hands with loneliness he is personifying the idea of loneliness by giving human qualities to an abstract idea These human qualities  include the shaking of hands In the same poem the poet is using fire symbolically He writes \n<$A> The Bond He shook hands with the loneliness who invited him to sit beside a fire and warm his hands Together they recounted tales of a love left behind exchanged cups of tears and sadly smiled at each other's faces as the flames linked them each to each \n<$C> Probably he sat beside a fire not only to warm his hands but also to comfort himself or to console himself or to help him forget a love left behind A symbol may be roughly defined as something that means more than what it is Symbols vary in the degree of identification and definition that the authors give them Although the poet may pin down the meaning of his symbol to something fairly definite and precise more often the symbol is so general in its meaning that it is able to suggest a great variety of more specific meanings For example a flag represents a nation a Mercedes Benz is a sign or symbol of power or wealth \n<$A> Other commonly used figures of speech include the following One Overstatement And two Understatement and irony Overstatement means saying more of what one really means For example if you say I will die if I don't pass my literature paper in the forthcoming examination you don't expect the people to believe you You are merely adding emphasis to what you really mean When Charles Owore in his poem Your Cigarette Burnt The Savannah Grass on page one hundred and eighteen writes \n<$B> Come listen to a boiling pot touch its heart and tell me what do you hear The sun sent down showers of heat that burned to cinder your edding conscience the earth at the touch of your fingers cracked Colour melts at your stare Orange white blue <O/> and all are the same to you Your cigarette burned the savannah grass the scorpion bit me and I cried The earth at the touch of your fingers cracked \n<$A> It is obvious that he does not want us to understand him  literally because we would not expect the ground to crack open if someone placed their fingers on it \n<$C> On the other hand understatement or saying less than what one means may exist in what one says or merely in how one says it For example you commonly hear people inviting others for a bite when the table is actually is laid with different kinds of foods for example <ea/>matoke <ea/>ugali roastmeat and so on A bite is used when one is stating less than the truth Also in Maragoli Wedding Song on page eleven the poet understates the warning to the bride when he writes \n<$B> To the bride It is difficult really difficult to leave your home for another place Refrain to the bridegroom but cultivate cultivate well so that the seeds of our ancestors can continue to bear fruit \n<$C> The real problem of the bride is not actually leaving her home for the man's home but when she tries to adjust and acquaint herself to her new home and bring it up Therefore the poet stated less than what he meant When David Rubadiri in his poem Stanley Meets Mutesa on page twenty eight writes \n<$A> <ea/><O/> <ea/>karibu White men you are welcome The gate of polished reeds closes behind them and the West is let in \n<$C> The poet meant more than what he stated It wasn't merely letting the West in The action allowed in all the evils associated with the West for example colonisation exploitation brainwashing just to mention a few \n<$A> Lastly but not the least we shall discuss irony in poetry Irony means saying one thing but meaning another Irony is useful in poetry because it creates humour A situation can be said to be ironical when the outcome of an event is contrary to what might have been expected Do not confuse irony which means the opposite of what one means with sarcasm and satire Sarcasm is a bitter or cutting speech which is intended to wound or hurt the feelings of another while satire is ridicule of human folly or vice in a humorous way A poet uses satire with the purpose of bringing about reform or at least of keeping other people from falling into similar folly or vice \n<$C> A very good example of satire in poetry is found in Henry Barlow's poem Building The Nation on page seventy one The poet wrote this poem to satirise those people in positions of authority who say all the right things but fail to practise what they preach In public they appear to be very busy but actually doing nothing Examples of sarcasm can be found in <name/> poems For Miriam on pages thirty nine", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '4284962d-cf38-45f2-a7d7-cb479347a2a3', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.018127+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': "<$A> Good afternoon Let's continue from where we stopped yesterday We are looking at the Spanish civil war from nineteen thirty-six to nineteen thirty-nine and I think we stopped at further looking at the significance of the war in the history of Europe For one this war brought Germany and Italy closer together It brought them closer together and this led to the establishment of the Rome Berlin axis pact And the pact was established in October nineteen thirty-six in October nineteen thirty-six It was a treaty of <O/> between the two countries between Germany and Italy And some months later in nineteen thirty-seven Hitler and Mussolini signed an anti-committee pact And this one was directed against the Soviet Union It was uh an alliance aimed against communist Soviet Union And uh point number two the civil war in Spain also provided a training ground for the Second World War It was a training ground for the Second World War The war the civil war gave a very good opportunity for the Germans to try out new weapons of warfare It also gave them an opportunity to try out new weapons For example they tried this uh <foreign/>Blitzkrieg which means lightning war They tried this during the Spanish civil war They also tried out dive bombing whereby the aeroplanes would dive and bomb They also tried high level bombings and the use of paratroopers the use of paratroopers and also high speed tanks So all this equipment  was tried during the civil war and were perfected where they were found to be lacking As a result when the Second World War broke out <O/> Germany was in a better position compared to that of the French and the British In nineteen thirty-seven in nineteen thirty-seven Hitler formally renounced the war guilt cause of the treaty of Versailles The other step he took was to announce that Germany was no longer bound by the provision of the treaty which said that Germany had been solely responsible for starting the First World War That one he renounced And the next move he made was that of union with Austria union with Austria which means <O/> or union with Austria This took place in nineteen thirty-eight but before this in nineteen thirty-four Hitler had tried to unite Austria with Germany But in that year that move had failed The move had failed because the Italians had seemed to be hostile They started to move their troops to the border So he abandoned the move But in nineteen thirty-eight he thought that the diplomatic situation was now favourable for him to try again Remember now he had formed a an alliance with Mussolini and also the Japanese so he thought that the preparations were now right for him to try again to unite Austria with Germany So what he did is that uh on eleventh no on twelfth March nineteen thirty-eight on twelfth March nineteen thirty-eight he sent the German army into Austria He sent the German army into Austria And on the following day on the following day the thirteenth of March nineteen thirty-eight Austria was declared to be a part of Germany Austria was declared to be part of Germany So this union with Austria was another clear violation of the treaty of Versailles And uh the allies that is particularly Britain and uh France did nothing All they could do was again to protest against this move by Hitler They took no action except protest and uh in Britain itself there was even sympathy for Hitler's action The British seemed to sympathise with him and there was the view that why shouldn't the Germans get together After all they're all Germans So they seemed to sympathise with Hitler And uh as a result this was another bloodless victory for Hitler When we look at the union what was the importance of this union with Austria How important was it to him We find that uh the union with Austria greatly improved Hitler's strategic position in Central Europe It had greatly improved Hitler's strategic position in Central Europe And this was especially true for the position of Czechoslovakia It was especially true for the position of Czechoslovakia And this union left Czechoslovakia surrounded by Germany on three sides Czechoslovakia was now surrounded by German territory on three sides Czechoslovakia now became the next target for Hitler Since now he had achieved what he wanted with Austria his next move was now against Czechoslovakia So let us now turn to this and look at the Czechoslovakia crisis The Czechoslovakia crisis and this crisis lasted from May to September nineteen thirty-eight from May to September nineteen thirty-eight How did it start What happened is that in Czechoslovakia there was about three point five million Germans There were three point five million Germans who lived in the area known as Sudetenland They lived in the area known as Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia and uh what happened is uh that these Germans had been in the dominant class in the old Austro-Hungarian Empire and as a result they resented their minority status in the Republic of Czechoslovakia So Hitler's excuse for intervening in Czechoslovakia was that these Germans were being persecuted by the Czechs He intervened as the saviour of the persecuted Germans He intervened there to save them from the persecution of the Czechs So what he did what you should know is that Hitler was not really interested in the welfare of the Jews of the German of these Germans in Czechoslovakia His main aim was to break up Czechoslovakia entirely Break it completely apart And uh he wanted to do this because his motives were mainly strategic His motives were mainly strategics and for one he wanted to command he wanted the command of the mountain regions on the border of Germany and Czechoslovakia He wanted command of those mountains They were very good for strategic purposes Secondly he also wanted the mineral wealth of Bohemia the mineral wealth of Bohemia And thirdly he also wanted to dismantle the Czech frontier fortifications They'd built line of fortification along the frontier against  Germany So he wanted to dismantle these fortifications Fourthly he also wanted to destroy Czechoslovakia Am I too fast very fast\n<$B> Yes \n<$A> So fourthly he also wanted to destroy Czechoslovakia as an outpost of the French security system Remember Czechoslovakia was an ally of France so he wanted to destroy this French security system And lastly but far from the least by getting rid of Czechoslovakia by getting rid of Czechoslovakia Hitler was also aiming at removing one of the main obstacles one of the main obstacles of German obstacles to German expansion eastwards one of the main obstacles to German expansion eastwards So as the pressure on Czechoslovakia mounted as pressure on Czechoslovakia mounted from Hitler Britain and France also put very strong pressure on Czechoslovakia Instead of going to the aid of Czechoslovakia they also came in to put more pressure on Czechoslovakia uh The pressure that the British were putting on Czechoslovakia was that Czechoslovakia should accept Hitler's demands And the reason why they did this is that their one big aim their one overriding aim of the British and the French was to avoid another war breaking out in Europe That is why they were pressurising the Czechs to give in to Hitler's demands As a result of that between September fifteenth between September fifteen and September twenty-ninth Chamberlain the British Prime Minister Chamberlain the British Prime Minister made three flights He made three flights to Germany In that short period he made three flights to Germany in an attempt to appease Hitler in an attempt to appease Hitler and this appeasement was at the expense of the Czechs in order to avoid war So the first visit took place on fifteenth September and during this visit Chamberlain accepted the separation of the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia He accepted that this part of Sudetenland where the Germans lived should be separated from Czechoslovakia from Czechoslovakia So what he that is uh Chamberlain and the French Premier was known as <name/>Daladier both of them both of them forced the Czechs to agree to this arrangement They forced them to agree to this separation of Sudetenland and if they refused when the Czechs tried to refuse they were threatened the two threatened to desert them and leave them on their own at their own fate with Hitler So they had no choice but to accept this arrangement Then on twenty-second September of the same month same month and same year Chamberlain made his second visit to Hitler in Germany He went there to announce to Hitler that he had secured an agreement based on the principle of secession of Sudetenland an agreement based on the secession of Sudetenland that is they would be separated from Czechoslovakia But when he arrived there to his dismay he found that uh Hitler had raised his demands He found that Hitler had already raised his demands He needed more that what he had needed previously According to the new demands Hitler wanted the secession of the Sudetenland in three days He wanted the area to be separated within three days and he also wanted an an immediate occupation of the area by German troops Secession within three days and occupation of the area by German troops And this now seemed an impossible This one seemed an impossible demand for the British and the French to force on the Czechs It seemed almost impossible now to do anything And as a result both France and Britain began to prepare for war They saw that they could not do anything now to avoid war from coming There was nothing else they could do so they started to prepare for war \nBut at the last moment at the last moment Mussolini stepped in Mussolini stepped in and uh he proposed a conference be held to solve the problem He proposed that a conference be held to sort out the problem And uh the conference was uh accordingly held And uh countries represented were Germany Italy France and Britain Only those four countries were represented in the conference The Czechs themselves were not represented They were excluded And you know this was to discuss their territory So they were excluded and it was Hitler himself who insisted that they be excluded from the conference So the British and the French gave in to his demand that the Czechs be excluded from the conference In the case of the Russians they were not even invited Nobody wanted anything to do with them so they were not invited to the conference So this conference met on September twenty-ninth to thirtieth met from twenty-ninth to thirtieth September of the same year and they met at Munich met at Munich in Germany And uh the outcome of the conference is that uh Hitler received almost everything he had demanded He received almost everything he had demanded And as a result the Sudetenland was separated from Czechoslovakia and it became part of the German Reich It became part of the German Reich uh In return in return for this concession the powers that were represented agreed to spare the rest of Czechoslovakia They agreed that the the rest of Czechoslovakia remained as it was be spared uh After that at the conference Hitler declared that he had no more territorial demands to make in Europe Said that he had no more All he needed He had now got whatever he needed So he had no more demand territorial demand in Europe At that point Chamberlain returned to England When he returned to England after the conference he announced that he had brought peace with honour that he had brought peace with honour and he claimed that it was peace for our time He claimed that during their time there will be peace But Hitler did not keep his word Hitler did not keep his word because  in the following year in March nineteen thirty-nine Hitler broke his promise and occupied the rest of Czechoslovakia He broke his promise and occupied the rest of Czechoslovakia And this occupation had very important repercussions for the history of Europe", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '9f01d7e8-a8d7-49b1-b3aa-2a3749da00ad', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.019192+00:00',

{'text': "<$A> Point number five Britain and France also did all they could to include the Soviet Union in a great block of states in a great block of states pledged to resist German aggression Tried to bring the Soviet Union in this block of states that had pledged to resist German aggression but this attempt to bring the Soviet Union in did not succeed It did not succeed Point number six Germany responded to this uh formation of this uh alliance these uh guarantees of help to these countries Germany responded to this by making the Rome Berlin axis They responded by making the Rome Berlin axis into a military alliance It was turned into a military alliance and it was called the Pact of Steel This alliance that was formed now between Italy and uh Germany was came to be known as the Pact of Steel Apart from that in addition to this Japan not Japan Germany and Italy also sought to extend this alliance to include Japan Hungary Yugoslavia and Spain You see Tried to include the other Fascist states within this alliance The next point which is also very important which is also very important is that uh after Germany had occupied Czechoslovakia this now compelled the European countries who are opposed to Germany to begin preparing for war They began to prepare for war because now they saw that war was inevitable so they began preparations to prepare for it For example air raid air raid shelters were built They started to construct air raid shelters also trenches were dug Trenches were dug They also distributed gas masks to their population to the civilians gas mask masks were supplied to the population and conscription was introduced in Britain Conscription was introduced in Britain and above all a race for armaments began A race for armaments began These Europeans now started to arm themselves just like uh the Europeans before the First World War when there was a race for armaments Now here again it is started But I think the timing was somehow late because the war was just around the corner So it was no longer now From then onwards it was no longer a question of if war comes We are not talking about if war comes but we are talking now of when the war comes Because you could say that war was really imminent And uh what you should also realise is that uh I mentioned yesterday that Rhineland gave Hitler a springboard for the an attack against France So the same case here Czechoslovakia also now gave him a a springboard for an attack in the east They provided him with a springboard for an attack in the east And we see that the next crisis the next crisis became the immediate cause of the Second World War The next crisis now became the immediate cause of the Second World War And this one involved Poland It involved Poland So let's look at this crisis German's Germany's Germans' threat against Poland So after the Germans had occupied Czechoslovakia their next target now became Poland and they at once began to put a lot of pressure on Poland uh began to put a lot of pressure on Poland to restore the port of Danzig They wanted Poland to restore the port of Danzig on the North Sea to Germany They also wanted What happened is that after the First World War I think you have heard this Here we have Germany there was a point which was created which separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany And this corridor here belonged to Poland So now Germany also now started to to demand that Poland allowed Germany to construct a railway and a road across this Polish corridor to connect East Prussia with the rest of Germany So that was the pressure it was now putting on Czechoslovakia To give back Danzig and to allow Germany to construct a railway and a highway across the Polish corridor to join East Prussia But the Poles resisted this move by the Germans They resisted and uh at this stage it appears that uh Hitler did not Hitler appears not to have taken the French and British guarantee of Poland's independence seriously Otherwise if he had done if he had taken it seriously then he would not have attempted to threaten Poland And uh secondly Hitler did not expect the two countries that is Britain and and France to go to war for the sake of Poland He never expected them to go to war for the sake of Poland And Hitler had come to hold the leaders of the two countries in contempt All they all those years he had dealt with them he had come to hold them in contempt So he thought that he could still get his way with Poland as he had done with uh Czechoslovakia Austria and the others He was also feeling Something else which made him to be very bold is that Hitler also knew that the two countries were not ready for war He knew that they were unprepared for war He also knew that large segments of their population were opposed to fighting a war to save Poland So because of all these reasons he kept on pressurising Poland to give back Danzig and to allow Germany to construct a railway and a highway across the Polish corridor On the other hand Britain and France knew that by themselves They knew that by themselves they could not be able to defend Poland By the *sameself> by themselves they were not strong enough to do it So they tried all they could to bring in the USSR into an alliance against Germany So negotiations were started at this particular period when Germany was threatening Poland Britain and France started to negotiate with the Soviet Union so that to see they could form an alliance collective alliance against Germany But these negotiations seemed to move forward fairly slowly and very cautiously They did make to be They didn't seem to be making any progress because each side was very suspicious of the other The Soviets were very suspicious of of the British and the French And the French and the British were also very suspicious of the Soviet There was much distrust so there was no progress being made And it was in the midst it was in the midst of these negotiations that on twenty-third August nineteen thirty-nine on twenty-third August nineteen thirty-nine that the world was shocked to learn of a Nazi Soviet non-aggression pact Did you get that It was just a thunderbolt Nobody was expecting that It came as a great shock to everybody in the world Who could have imagined that after all after everything that Hitler had said against the communists that in the end it'd it would come together and form an alliance or a pact or an agreement of any kind It was a great shock to everybody who was concerned in this and then let's look at this uh Nazi Soviet non-aggression pact What was it all about The main reason why Hitler formed this uh non-aggression pact was that uh the Nazis were not willing to risk war on two fronts at the one at the same time They did not want to fight on two fronts as it had happened during the First World War and that's why on twenty-third August nineteen thirty-nine they signed a ten year a ten year non-aggression pact with the USSR Now this pact divided Poland between the two powers that is between Germany and the Soviet Union And both powers also agreed to attack Poland at once to attack Poland together This pact also allowed the USSR to take over also allowed the Soviet Union to take over the Baltic states take over the Baltic states They in the Baltic states They're very tiny states around the Baltic Sea Lithuania Latvia and Estonia So now Soviet Union was given the green light by Germany to take over those three countries She was also given the green light to take the province of Bessarabiya The province of Bessarabiya from Rumania Those were the secret agreements of this pact And why did the Soviet Union also agree to sign this pact with Hitler and yet they knew that Hitler all along was spreading fire against the Soviet Union For one the Soviet Union also wanted to avoid trouble with Germany and two the Red Army was better equipped and better organised following the recent purges There had been very widespread purges in the Soviet Union in the mid nineteen thirties and most uh of the uh army officers had been purged many had been killed So Stalin wanted to give this army time to recover from these purges to be well trained to be well equipped Of course he realised that at that particular moment he was not ready for war Secondly Russia also calculated on a lengthy war in which the great capitalist force of Germany France and Britain would exhaust each other He thought that the war if war broke out it'd be a long one and this capitalist force would exhaust each other and he would finally step in and get spoils from these uh exhausted powers So this Nazi Soviet pact sealed the fate of Poland It sealed the fate of Poland and on September first nineteen thirty-nine on September first nineteen thirty-nine the Germans invaded Poland the Germans invaded Poland And two days later two days later on third September Britain and France declared war on Germany Britain and France declared war on Germany and thus the World the Second World War began So we can see that the German invasion of Poland became the immediate cause of the Second World War It became the immediate cause of the Second World War So we have been looking at those events leading to the Second World War and uh so now the question is what were the causes of the Second World War You <AmE/>guys <O/> the causes of the Second World War I think we can handle that question now What were the origins of the Second World War What brought about the Second World War Can you answer that What is Let us start We have some few minutes Let us start on the politics of the Second World War the politics of the Second World War The interpretation I'll not go into details much detail because I have already mentioned them when I was talking about this The interpretation was that this was Hitler's war The interpretation was that Hitler and his Nazis were responsible for the Second World War and their contributions were as follows Their contributions were as follows One the nazi ideology The nazi ideology was inherently expansionist and aggressive The Nazi ideology was inherently expansionist and aggressive You have seen how aggressive they were and I'll not repeat that So their expansionist and war-like ideas eventually led to the outbreak of the war Secondly Hitler's foreign policy had two major aims Hitler's foreign policy had two major aims a) to repudiate the treaty of Versailles to repudiate or to dismantle the treaty of Versailles b) to re-establish Germany's national position in Central Europe to re-establish Germany's national position in Central Europe And Hitler's foreign policy was clearly sketched out His policy was clearly sketched out in his book <foreign_>Mein Kampf<foreign/> which was published in nineteen twenty-five He had pointed out in that book that it was not only it was not enough to call for the revision of the treaty of Versailles Revising the treaty by itself was not enough according to what he had written in that book He had also said that oh Germany was to dismantle the treaty completely get rid of it completely and it was that was the only way in which Germany could hope to regain all the territories that she had lost after the First World War by dismantling the treaty Once it was dismantled then Germany would be in a position to regain all the territories she had lost after the First World War", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '14a9ebc1-34d9-4cf4-aeb8-c7a49e2b460f', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.020214+00:00',

{'text': "<$A> Good morning ladies and gentlemen Today we have a visitor who goes by the <_>by theRRR impossible name of <name/> from Germany and he has decided that he would like to learn a little about African history Then I think he's welcome We don't shy from visitors Agreed \n<$B> Yah\n<$A> Very good Right I'm told that you dealt with the question of the fight for independence in North Africa in East Africa in West Africa and that I should concentrate on Southern Africa that's what I was told by Mrs <name/> correct \n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Okay We'll take to begin with Portuguese Africa and see with particular reference to Angola and Mozambique The main problem with Portuguese possessions is or was the fate of what to do with the peasants as indeed we have seen when we looked at the colonial policies colonial administration in both Portugal in both Portuguese Angola as well as Portuguese Mozambique Indeed we saw that throughout the colonial period in Portuguese Africa peasants had been systematically squeezed from their land to the extent as we saw they began to organize against the Portuguese colonialism We saw for example that by late nineteen forties peasants were being forced to grow cotton they were being forced to grow cash crops rather than grow their own food And the effect of that was that both in particularly in Angola we find that peasants were faced by frequent famines And these frequent famines definitely arose from the  fact that the peasants were emphasizing the growing of cash crops They were embarking on growing cash crops at the expense of growing their own food Consequently we find that the government accused Africans of being psychologically resistant to regular work i e this seemed to them to confirm the idea that these natives were very very lazy That these natives uh did not uh uh uh uh uh have what we call work ethic And it is with that background that we find that by nineteen sixties the peasants were getting a raw deal And this raw deal led to organize uh this time not what we call passive resistance but this time to organize uh open rebellion against the colonial government For example we find that in January nineteen sixty one Angolans were getting very little uh for their cotton We remember that it is this or these low prices that led them to organize open resistance to the colonial government In January nineteen sixty-one for example peasants decided to take the law into their hands in what has come to be called Maria's War Maria's War January nineteen sixty-one And what they did was uh to they banned cotton seeds they decided to ransack European stores They they sunk river barges They decided that uh they would kill cattle and they barricaded roads uh particularly in Kwanza as well as two areas where uh this uh happened And the all these are along the railway line Luanda railway line because of that they thought this would in fact be able to uh make the Portuguese government listen It was as a result of the Maria's War that we find in February also nineteen sixty-one MPLA come in into being And it was with the coming of MPLA that we find that the government tried as much as they could to see whether in fact they would be able uh uh to meet the demands of the nationalists For example we find that they released nationalists whom they had arrested during Maria's War or Cotton Cotton War Cotton War \nUnfortunately the or fortunately rather the nationalist leaders decided that they would try and release the nationalist leaders who were arrested and they tried to storm Luanda jail to release uh these nationalists who had been arrested The consequence of that was that this led to white panic The Whites panicked and led to what we call pogrom led to what we call pogrom i e the Whites simply decided to take the law into their hands and killed any African that came uh into their sight And hundreds of Blacks were consequently uh uh killed uh by the Whites as because the Whites uh had literally panicked uh uh because they feared that the Blacks might take the law into their hands and also attack them And the question is why Why would you have the Whites panicking Why would you have uh the Whites take the law into their hands Now you recall what we said that in the forties and fifties many poor and ignorant Portuguese had been immigrating into Angola And these poor ignorant Whites were competing for the same jobs that Africans were also trying to get Indeed we find that they were competing for what we call menial jobs menial jobs And that was because they did not have uh they did not have any education at all which would have qualified them for uh uh the more uh uh lucrative uh uh civil servants jobs or even in the private sector And we find therefore that these Whites were employed believe you me as carpenters as drivers as shop assistants as cleaners and even as prostitutes And therefore uh we find that whereas elsewhere in Africa as we have seen Africans were getting opportunities opened up after the Second World War what we find in Angola is that the clock seemed to be reversed and instead of giving uh uh job opportunities to the Africans their jobs in fact were being taken by these Whites uh from Europe And it is this therefore that led to serious colour bars The only way that the blacks could be kept down at laws by introducing barriers uh uh related to their colour In other words colour bar was used as a weapon to strengthen the hold that these Whites had on uh uh job opportunities on economic opportunities or even uh in educational opportunities What it was these whites were not simply restricted to the towns they were also taking jobs in the rural areas Thus we find that the Black élites lost their place in business as well as in government And these uh jobs were as I have said taken up by literally illiterate Portuguese And the effect of that then is that there was very bitter resentment by the Blacks against the Whites Indeed you find interestingly that many whites lived in what we call twilight areas They lived in twilight areas Literally they lived in slums uh uh like Mathare Valley or <name/> or wherever And they too were also literally uh uh disillusioned by what they found uh uh by the sort of life that they were living in Angola \nNow the explosion occurred particularly in the coffee growing areas uh particularly in the northern part of Angola Coffee prices had been high in nineteen fifties And this had led to coffee speculators coming into Angola uh particularly for <O/> And because of the high prices that uh coffee was catching the Portuguese were anxious to settle in northern part of Angola so that they could share in the piece of the cake i e they wanted also to be able to grow uh cash crops And the effect of that was that this led to more elimination of land This led to more elimination of land And with the elimination of land this meant of course that the Blacks were dispossessed of their land and with dispossession of their land they were left with only one commodity which they could sell and of course that was their labour In other words from being land owners they were now turned into uh uh servants But labour was never enough as we saw uh uh and the effect of that is that the Portuguese government embarked on a system of recruited labour that amounted to literally forced labour and this forced labour therefore meant in fact that having lost their land now they were being forced to work in their own land but this time for someone else In short then what we find is that the whites became a privileged colonial élite They became a privileged colonial élite literally living off the colonized people who are as we saw uh uh we are talking about both Angola and Mozambique in the forties They were deprived of education they were deprived of health facilities they were deprived of job mobility they were deprived of economic uh prospects And it is this therefore that sparked uh uh the uh uh workers labourers uh underprivileged to embark on war In northern part of of Angola this came in March nineteen sixty-one when workers in a plantation called Primavere I don't know what the Portuguese pronunciation is Primavere Plantation uh asked to be paid their wages These <AmE/>guys had not been paid for a whole six months for a whole six months And when they asked for their pay of course the white farmers uh refused to listen to them and this therefore led to violent demonstrations by the workers And it is as a result of that that fighting uh uh broke up and this started what we call Liberation War Liberation War or War of Liberation\nIndeed with the outbreak of war Portugal found out that she would not she certainly could not uh stand the tide of nationalism And to be able to do this she had to spend a lot of money to try and control this nationalist force In other words she was facing very serious armed struggle very serious armed struggle And this was not in fact confined to Angola alone It was uh uh widespread It was present in Guinea-Bissau where they were A war preparation broke out at the same time It was also a presence in Mozambique For that reason therefore we find that uh Portugal was forced to send uh Portuguese army to these territories to try and contain this nationalist struggle By nineteen seventies uh for example we find that Portuguese in Africa or the Portuguese army in Africa was as follows In Guinea-Bissau for example uh there was an army of forty thousand men In Angola she was forced to send fifty thousand soldiers and in Mozambique uh she was forced to send roughly another fifty thousand uh soldiers By nineteen seventies also we find by mid nineteen seventies we find that the total army in Portuguese Africa was in excess of roughly around two hundred thousand soldiers two hundred thousand soldiers Equally by mid nineteen seventies the the casualties had also uh risen indeed by that by mid seventies uh uh Portuguese government had lost uh about eight thousand soldiers eight thousand soldiers uh who uh had been killed by the nationalist forces Two Portuguese soldiers fought very hard inspired us with you remember by the idea that they were safe back in White civilization in Africa but this did not stop the war having fairly serious consequences for the Portuguese themselves For example we find that the government was spending roughly about forty-five per cent of its budget on the war forty-five per cent of the budget on the war which obviously meant that this had very serious uh repercussions on the economy Indeed we find that this was in fact straining the weak uh Portuguese economy And by the way Portugal is uh as far as Europe is concerned is one of the least developed uh Portugal and Spain uh uh are two of probably the least developed countries in Europe Secondly because of this these casualties that we have mentioned this led to very low moral very low moral amongst the soldiers Now the effect of that then is that Portugal alone could not she was not in a position to be able to control the uh uh nationalist struggle And it is for that reason that we find that Portugal turned to NATO Portugal turned to NATO for assistance For example we find that as early as nineteen sixty-one as early as nineteen sixty-one Portugal was able to blackmail John Kennedy who was then the US president to stop supporting the nationalist forces You will find that John Kennedy was more sympathetic to nationalist struggle indeed by that time the American government was egging him on the uh uh various colonial powers to grant independence to uh uh their territories as part and parcel of fighting the Cold the Cold War which was going on uh at this particular time And the way that they twisted John Kennedy was to tell him man if you do not stop supporting these nationalist forces then we will make sure that American planes do not refuel in uh Azores uh Azores uh uh Islands", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '052a2fc9-18cc-4c44-a0b7-5f0edc5b5288', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.021130+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': "<$A> You will find that if you look at a map when planes are flying from the US they had to come and refuel in Azores Islands before they go to Jordan Therefore strategically Azores Islands were very important to uh American global strategy and for that reason this was evaluated uh uh uh a concession being allowed to have their planes refueled in Azores Islands And equally uh this was uh came at a time you remember when there was trouble in Congo what is today Zaire with again the nationalist forces uh fighting uh amongst themselves with Russia coming in uh this seeming to uh frighten the interests of the Western powers \nAnd it is for that reason therefore that the Portuguese government knew that they really had a very nice weapon to twist the arms of the American government The effect of that was that Portugal was allowed to divert NATO military equipment uh from Europe to uh the colonies For example they were allowed to use napalm bombs uh to uh <O/> back these African nationalists And it is because of that that we find in nineteen sixty-one sixty-two because of this diversion of NATO military equipment the Portuguese were fairly well armed in comparison with the Africans And in nineteen sixty-one sixty-two we find that twenty thousand uh uh Africans died in Angola Equally arising from that we find that the war was also internationalized The war was also internationalized i e it has ceased to be a local problem and in many respects became an international problem For example we find that because of the cold war the various powers supported different nationalist groups FNLA for example gained support from Zaire Congo as it then it was because at that time Mobutu had become a target of the Americans It gained support also from the USA through of course uh uh uh Mobutu and it also gained support uh from China MPLA on the other hand gained support uh from Zambia and also uh uh from certainly USSR as well as from Tanzania \nHowever apart from internationalizing the war the Portuguese government also thought perhaps that it ought to embark on other or a new policy to try and make sure that it contained the uh uh it contained the nationalist forces For example in nineteen sixty-three Portugal decided to invite foreign investors decided to invite foreign investors from Britain from Germany from USA from France etcetera Hitherto she was very reluctant to invite foreign investors arguing that this uh ought to be left uh to Portuguese uh uh investors Now by inviting foreign investors she hoped that by so doing she would gain support against the nationalists' forces Equally she hoped that not only would she gain support from the countries where the investors would come from but she hoped also that by having investors come into Angola this would help to create wealth This would generate wealth and this wealth would then be used uh to finance the what we call counter-insurgency counter-insurgency i e she would be able to finance the war against the nationalists and in the fact this what I would call ruse the ruse in fact worked the trick worked Because as soon as these uh uh as soon as these businessmen European business men were allowed to invest in Angola they took it upon themselves to try and sell to their countries the idea that after all Portugal was not as bad a colonial power as the nationalists had in fact uh uh painted it to be And we find therefore that international support for the Angolan freedom fighters in fact declined So to that extent therefore Portugal had managed to convince the international community that she was not as bad uh uh uh as bad as she was painted as the colonial power Equally the second strategy was apart from calling for investors the second strategy was to try and split up the political parties i e deliberately engineer deliberately engineer divisions within the nationalist forces And this in fact Portugal succeeded in doing For example FNLA split up uh and led in nineteen sixty-five to the formation of UNITA of UNITA under uh Savimbi uh This was deliberately uh uh carried by uh Portuguese intelligence forces as far as uh we can tell Equally the Portuguese government apart from splitting FNLA it also encouraged uh competition rivalry between particularly between MPLA and FNLA And again this was deliberate to weaken the nationalist forces to ensure that in fact they were not able uh uh to put the Portuguese government at a corner And I would like to suggest therefore that the delay which we find we find that in apart from Namibia and South Africa uh uh Angola and Portugal were the last uh uh territories to gain independence\nAnd I would like to suggest that the reason for this is twofold one the international support that the Portuguese government was getting support from NATO countries and secondly the division that had been deliberately engineered by Portuguese intelligence forces However in spite of uh uh this we find that by nineteen sixties by late nineteen sixties by late nineteen sixties Portugal had begun to loosen colonial shackles She had begun to loosen colonial shackles in order to create what they thought would be a middle class what they thought would be a middle class that would in fact resist uh nationalist forces as well as nationalist policies Again look at Kenya for example from your Kenyan history you recall the way <name/> plan for example was designed to create oh an African middle class that would be able to support the uh uh uh British government It is a similar situation And this was done for example by and paying attention to agriculture For example the government introduced what you're call producer cooperatives producer cooperatives to market uh uh produce obviously therefore make sure that you are assisting uh uh farmers' uh introduction of producer cooperatives\nSecondly and unlike uh uh previously there was introduced agricultural extension services agricultural extension services again to be able uh uh to service uh uh the uh uh agriculture uh particularly in the rural areas And again the idea here was that you would create a uh uh cohort you would create a cohort of wealthy Africans who would be able to uh uh be recruited against socialist ideas And thirdly the third strategy was to pay attention to education and African education was expanded in order uh uh to ensure again that they were able through gaining education that they would qualify uh to be employed uh in the lower ranks of the civil service Finally again the government decided that in order to be able to reduce the number of White casualties uh in this war they decided that uh they could recruit Africans into the army One of course the Africans would be paid less therefore you would reduce the costs but also you would also ensure that you would reduce the casualties Let these Blacks slaughter one another while you sit back and enjoy the scene And this policy is very similar to the US policy in Vietnam where again if you look at the statistics you will find that invariably it is the Black Americans uh who were uh uh probably more in terms of their population during the Vietnam War And again also the NATO tried and contain these the these uh uh anti- anti-Portuguese forces They embarked on policy that you are familiar with i e they embarked on villagisation particularly in Eastern Angola they embarked on villagisation particularly in Eastern Angola The idea here was that by putting people in these security villages you would cut them off uh particularly from MPLA which was propagating in Eastern Angola And if you deny uh uh uh MPLA access to the rural population obviously you are denying them African support of various types Indeed they also made it clear not only villagisation but they also in fact began to spray crops They would be spraying crops to make sure that the crops died particularly uh using the napalm bombs But even with these attempts there was no way that the Portuguese government was going to succeed uh to control uh the nationalist forces largely because uh Portugal was facing fairly skilled guerrillas fairly skilled guerrillas and these guerrillas particularly in Angola were trained by USSR They were trained by USSR We know in Mozambique they were trained uh by China So you are not dealing uh in contrast to your Mau-Mau where you had uh uh fellows uh and axes and spears in uh uh Angola in Mozambique in Guinea-Bissau you uh uh facing a fairly well trained and sophisticated guerrilla force Faced by that situation events outside Angola uh turned the tide In April nineteen seventy-four largely because of the strained costs by the these nationalist wars in Africa or these guerrilla wars in Africa the soldiers in Portugal were simply fed up with their government And in April nineteen fifty-four a group which called itself Armed Forces Movement Armed Forces Movement staged a coup and took over uh the government in Portugal itself And the new rulers decided that they would grant independence to its African empire Hitherto you remember that uh the Portuguese rulers leaders were arguing that the Angola Mozambique Guinea-Bissau were part and parcel of the uh Portuguese uh uh Portuguese uh uh country uh Now the tide was turned and the Armed Forces Movement was prepared to grant uh independence And indeed this started for example with Guinea-Bissau which was granted independence in September nineteen seventy-four Guinea-Bissau granted independence in September nineteen seventy-four Mozambique got its independence in June nineteen seventy-five and Angola as we shall see gained independence in November nineteen seventy-five \nNow once it was clear that independence was coming there were attempts to try and reconcile particularly UNITA and MPLA as well as FNLA And in January nineteen seventy-five for example Kenyatta attempted your then president attempted to try and reconcile uh the two the three warring political parties And under his chairmanship MPLA FNLA and UNITA agreed that for the sake of independence they would be prepared to share uh power i e that the three parties would form a coalition and share power as they moved into independence But the scheme was sabotaged by Zaire obviously acting on behalf of their master the US the USA It was sabotaged by USSR and it was sabotaged by South Africa And indeed so you have Zaire USSR South Africa uh sabotaging the plan And also mercenaries We will find that all three parties were employing mercenaries during the war And of course the mercenaries would sabotage the peace agreement because once there was peace then it this meant that they would not have anyone to employ them And the effect of that is that this led to a foreign supported civil war a foreign supported civil war \nMobutu for example feared that if MPLA gained power and MPLA was regarded as a communist party was regarded as a communist party Mobutu feared that if MPLA came into power then they would be able to support anti-Mobutu forces and therefore that this uh would in fact uh spell trouble for uh Mobutu himself And for that reason Mobutu supported Holden Roberto who was uh uh the leader of FNLA What Mobutu hoped was that by supporting Holden Roberto uh he would be able to place FNLA into power and FNLA would also would be pro Zaire However FNLA was defeated by MPLA and not only that but MPLA in fact uh uh threatened to invade southern Zaire and indeed to overthrow uh uh uh Mobutu himself And it was only Mobutu only survived because he was supported by two NATO countries He was supported by USA and he was supported by France It is only the uh the intervention In fact France intervened twice It was only the intervention of US and the French which managed to save uh Mobutu's neck Now with FNLA being supported by NATO countries MPLA decided to go to the Warsaw Pact decided to go to the Warsaw Pact i e they looked to socialist countries for support certainly for military support and from April nineteen seventy-five we had literally  aid uh uh uh uh pouring literally pouring into Ruanda Russia uh East Germany Czechoslovakia you name it they all uh uh decided that they would support MPLA Street fighting started uh in Ruanda and by July nineteen seventy-five MPLA had won control of the capital uh parties Luanda and they decided to expel Whites", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'c94bae27-281a-4fb9-b4e9-ced0c20e9e34', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.022184+00:00',

{'text': "<$A> Good afternoon What's the joke Why the what I said good afternoon You don't respond by laughing do you Uh Anyway what were we saying at uh at ten We said uh I remember we mentioned belief in witchcraft and sorcery and blablabla yeah yeah And we talked about the tradition of bad eye I forgot to ask Is this a phenomenon a common phenomenon in all ethnic communities or is it just uh among the Nyanza people It is everywhere The fact that somebody can look at you and food turns into stone in your stomach It is yeah so anyway the idea is before I proceed the idea is that traditional systems are usually about the same thing yeah and when we are talking about their effect on human health then you are imagining a situation where what you believe in as a society not just as an individual determines the state of health And it's a very tricky uh relationship because you are looking for uh uh uh uh What are you looking for You are looking for determinants Yeah that why is this room dark today Is it my eyes You <AmE/>guys are probably absorbing all the light anyway since you are so boring There's uh a continuum yeah an axis of health And then there is the usual good health bad health and poor health yeah And then whichever way you are looking at it it's still determined by tradition because you are talking about practice based on cultural systems And when you're talking about a cultural system you're talking about habitual behaviour that is uh recurrent in society yeah I believe these are things that you know So uh we have said earlier and I'll say this again all diseases are said to have originally are said to have originally been deeply entrenched or rooted Yeah I don't know if that is good language They are said to have originally been deeply rooted or entrenched in the human social action system in the human social action system And remember we said that social action vis-à-vis health is very crucial because social action determines health and everything that you do is directed at somebody else And that somebody else has to be able to respond to your action And that response sometimes determines uh your health I don't know how but uh if it doesn't if it's an emotional response or a physical response or a social response somehow or another it can still make a difference Like if it's a physical thing and if you're not thinking of the bad side if say you meet somebody at the stadium yeah Who went to watch <ea/>Harambee Stars you <AmE/>guys are not patriotic uh There was no time The what Moi was there So you couldn't go I thought that was more reason you should go You <AmE/>guys have so many problems he might just solve some of them Why do you always wait even though these days they don't take that route but when they take that route why do you all crane your necks out and then wait For what reason To scream at him Don't say that in public uh It might be dangerous What was I saying before then Yeah if you get into a crowd-behaviour situation and then you say something unpleasant like what this <AmE/>guy was saying that you know uh the president was sitting on the VIP dais and I'd like to scream at him And that time maybe whatever has just scored a goal yeah People are thinking of the football People are having fun they are enjoying themselves and you are having personal differences with the president of the republic yeah Somebody will probably punch you out of He's not being nasty he's just it's just a spontaneous response Not that he likes the president himself but he might just decide that you are disrupting the peace And then if he punches you that's social action which derives from your own action And that punch is going to produce of course an effect on your health how You'll probably lose a tooth or two Yeah or like if it was in the movies you probably just fall unconscious Yeah you know how they punch you once in the movies and you're dead Yeah so if uh it is a situation where your action derives or produces counteraction from somebody else then whether there is a traditional value to it or not it still determines your health So either way you look at uh modernity as an intrusion on uh health behaviour because modernity states that this person is not supposed to have punched you and that he's just supposed to have told you this and this and this courtesy yeah And then uh traditionally it is the opposite People sort out their differences through war and do all sorts of uh good or bad things which they consider to be uh supported by tradition uh traditional perception or explanation of sickness Has somebody ever owed you money for a very long time and then he suddenly calls you out of nowhere and he tells you he wants to pay you How does it feel Like for seven months or eight months or a year uh You don't believe it uh You probably refuse to believe that <AmE/>guy because you've been chasing him for a year and he's he hasn't paid you But when when such a feeling engulfs you then you project it onto other people and that's why I'm so happy today Anyway uh traditional perception or explanation of sickness is usually very mechanical Put that in capital if you don't mind and look for your own explanations uh is usually very mechanical If you remember <name/> that <AmE/>guy of the solidarities you know what mechanical solidarity is all about yeah with the said mechanical explanations And I'm sure you're aware of that Because of this therefore basic illnesses easily kill traditionally oriented people who dismiss those illnesses with the said mechanical explanations And please add there that traditionally oriented people not only live in the rural areas Even those who are thoroughly urban or modern like you can stay traditionally oriented and therefore the basic diseases that would affect anybody and somebody would dash to hospital and get quick medical attention and get out you dismiss it as just one of those things that you were told by your mother or father that will happen at such a time because of this and this and this and therefore you don't give it uh the attention it deserves Modern medicine is therefore relegated by uh uh that traditional orientation The belief system in a traditional make-up approach to disease yeah affects it relegates modern medicine uh to the dustbin because of that Lay beliefs and theories l a y lay lay from layman Welcome home Lay beliefs and theories about points of causation yeah like an origin of a disease yeah points of causation lay beliefs and theories about points of causation of various illnesses usually determine health behaviour usually determine health behaviour at a quantifiable rate of about eighty-eight per cent This is from research that has been done by people At a quantifiable rate of about eighty-eight per cent amongst traditionally oriented persons So we are saying that modern medicine is only given medical theory modern medical theory is only given about twelve per cent by the people we are talking about And therefore it is up to you as a student or as the researcher to decide who is the the traditionally oriented person What kind of a person is that Stop holding yourself like this I'm sure you don't have those in your traditions But we are told it's bad Yeah the next thing you know is somebody will drop dead yeah Who are traditionally oriented persons What's wrong with them What's right with them uh Come on Now you cough who are these people who You <AmE/>guys suffer from some disease uh Is it like this in all the other classes or is it just mine Really I'm that boring I shall leave you very fast Uh uh It is for such a reason therefore It is for the said reason what we just uh mentioned that the spread of STDs Sexually Transmitted Diseases including HIV it is for such a reason that the spread of STDs including HIV What is HIV in full Uh It's something to do with AIDS uh It is for such a reason that the spread of STDs including HIV is difficult to inhibit in most communities in the rural areas in most communities in the rural areas and in most communities in the rural areas and amongst those of us who maintain strong traditional bias and amongst those of us who maintain strong traditional bias And that's why I was asking you who traditionally oriented persons are but since you are not interested <O/> Yeah and especially among uh the coast that among the Digo and the Luo and the Luo from Nyanza Yeah they have a that problem You know what we are saying if you're talking about traditional practice and uh uh belief then you imagine uh those death rites that the Luos have to perform yeah whether you you like it or not If you don't do it then the whole family gets wiped out by some strange hand or fate You know that and it happens actually it's not a lie yeah but a Believe me it does yeah If say like your father dies and your mother say she's such a strong Christian she doesn't want to hear those things to do with that and that yeah uh which ones like having to spend the night with a body on uh on the same bed yeah to say that final farewell yeah And eventually uh the next day after immediately after burial the day after or is it two days after there's a certain limit yeah and within that period she has to have been inherited sexually not just uh uh what is it called not just uh symbolically yeah somebody has to prove to people to the villagers that uh she's actually accepted to be inherited yeah And like the other day was it in the Weekly Review or one of these weekly magazines but this was in Ukambani surprisingly There's uh a very learned lady who I shall not mention she actually went public with this She was taking her husband home and they're very strong Christians the husband and her and the family And uh there was a crisis when they reached there because things were going on slowly You know how Christians take their time Yeah and then there was this <AmE/>guy who's been I think he's a charcoal dealer or something and he's he was looking very scruffy The Standard <AmE/>guy drew a cartoon of him in the People Magazine And this <AmE/>guy interrupted the ceremony and said that this uh the Christians are taking too long he wants to finish his job and go away And and the wife of the deceased apparently asked what job does he have to do here and then somebody whispered and told her that this is the <AmE/>guy who is supposed to take over You know like finish and before the husband was lowered into the grave she went and locked herself in the car and it was so bloody hot she was sweating and she fainted inside the car In fact that's why it made the news otherwise it wouldn't have because it's an ordinary thing yeah But because she went and because of the worry and anxiety yeah that this <AmE/>guy she's been seeing helping around with the chores or whatever they are suddenly says they are wasting his time he wants to go away you know is uh She got a bit too worried and then she fainted and then luckily for her she was taken to I think Machakos Medical whatever uh the district hospital and she made it back to Nairobi without having to fulfil uh those things I didn't know the Kambas do them as well I just learned yeah they do No then there must have been some Luo blood in one of them", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL',

{'text': "<$A> Traditional practices and beliefs traditional practices or practice if you want and belief thus leads not only to  behavioural apathy that is towards the uh uh medical embetterment yeah  behavioural apathy but also to defaults in the search for early treatment of any disease or ailment It creates  behavioural apathy People don't bother yeah Because of traditional belief and and practice a certain apathy is uh cultivated amongst the population because they know that blablabla And also to default yeah like somebody defaulting from a loan not paying to default in the early search in the search for early treatment of any ailment or any disease Yeah yeah I hope you get that clear By this apathy we are saying that uh in your behaviour because of tradition your behaviour gets directed at uh uh uh at satisfying the cultural goals of your community Yeah and I believe we all strive to do that You want to please your father You want to please your grandfather if he's still alive by not doing things which they don't expect But having been through the university maybe you know that what you are doing is not very healthy like yeah what which unhealthy traditional practice do you know Apart from inheriting wives female circumcision actually that's very deadly uh does it still it stillRRR prevail \n<$All> Yes \n<$A> How do the mothers allow I mean at this in this age and times but uh I understand anyway one of the best reasons they've always given it is supposed to heighten pleasure yeah And then keep because for the men they they've always given those good reasons It's biblically sanctioned and it's got things to do with your health and you stay clean But for the women what does it do Oh my god Yeah so uh uh there's a star I put here I need to remind you about uh yes leprosy Don't write this please I forbid you from writing leprosy What did we say about leprosy I mentioned something to do with leprosy last week or the other week yeah yeah uh It is socially stigmatizing and therefore what Can you remember if you may The person is isolated But that is after he starts losing limbs yeah but when you suffer from leprosy at the beginning you know in your head that leprosy creates uh this labelling Yeah it's a stigmatizing disease Therefore what do you do Expose yourself Isolate yourself Yeah and what is the effect of that on your health Actually what did I say if it matters to you Are you bothered What did I say uh Somebody was asking me this morning about that party I'm still going to throw it yeah so you <AmE/>guys don't give up The one I promised at the end of the year the end of this semester Yeah I'll invite all of you whom those who want to come If you don't want to come you can go to hell yeah But uh those who want to come I'll invite you and a few who are ready to help will help me with the cooking and then we can all eat and be merry yeah But first let's finish this What did I say about leprosy Yeah what I I'm referring to the reason I put a star here is when I talk about uh uh what I just said uh uh uh about defaulting in the search for treatment leprosy comes to mind because the problem with leprosy and the only reason that is the where the medics have found it so hard to take care of leprosy is because once people realize that they suffer from that limb-snatching disease they disappear And instead of seeking medical attention or telling people what their problem is so they can be referred to the various medical facilities that exist or some money can be raised for them instead people withdraw and get isolated as she says And you begin to suffer until it is at an whatever an advanced stage Then you expose yourself because you can't take the suffering anymore but then it's too late You already lost your fingers or your toes or whatever they are So in the morning when I told you about socially stigmatising diseases uh I don't know if I mentioned I think I mentioned leprosy The reason for that I'm listing those things like cholera TB uh uh all those things is because when you live in a society where respect means a lot to anybody yeah and that is true in almost all societies that you want to carry yourself around like even if you are poor you want to pretend that you're okay and you had your last meal about an hour ago yeah But if that were not to be the case you try and portray a situation where your stomach is rumbling but you don't want to show people that you're not you're not you've not eaten Because they'll probably traditionally they'll probably dismiss you as a lazy person because you can till the land and get the maize out or you can go and harvest the maize and roast it for yourself So they'll probably just get rid of you and say that's mentally not physically They'll probably just say uh Shikoko is not able to do these things so just forget about him yeah But it's not because he likes it like that it's because at that particular moment maybe he's a village idler yeah who just hangs about And uh eventually he happens to chance by your house at about quarter to one yeah And uh every day he goes to a different house and he has so many stories to tell And being able to afford food you probably just invite him for lunch And then people the community gets to learn yeah because of <foreign/>Gemeinschaft and those mechanical solidarities that we're talking about You you're operating in a situation where almost everybody knows the other So if you suffer from a disease they'll know If you are healthy they'll know If you are thin they'll know why you are thin even before you know why yeah And then you're told all sorts of theories yeah lay based on the layman's perspective lay theories about your own health So what we are driving at here in a nutshell is the fact that society defines the health status for an individual traditionally yeah And they they're able to say at any one time that you know uh uh that foolish man called Ken he has a problem but he doesn't know yeah His stomach keeps protruding out by the day and he thinks you know it's like this like this Society explains it for you And then on the street you hear them giggling about it and and laughing about it with baritones and all that And they say that you know this <AmE/>guy has got this problem You don't know that you have that problem Yeah so the stigmatization does not start at that stage but because of that traditional outlay the approach we give to people's health yeah like the bible says we look at the speck in other people's eyes before we see the log in our own yeah After that then the individual begins to define his own health status and that's the time you begin to think What's the problem with me actually Then you start a soul-searching process and then you look for medical facilities if they exist If they don't you look for traditional explanations and you go to an old man the sages of the community and you ask them what is wrong with you as if you don't know what's wrong with you yeah And that's the role that tradition plays and that's why somebody says eighty-eight per cent of our health uh health activity and health status and health-related behaviour is determined by tradition <ea/>Maswali Questions We've talked too much about tradition Move on to something else But since I'm being paid for <O_><O/> yeah That's why I like you <AmE/>guys You never have any problem When the exams come you all get seventy and over per cent and and life goes on and you get out you get jobs so you come up and you get married and you die So uh uh uh uh uh there's a question I've written down somewhere which I wanted you to think about no I left it on the other yeah It should be here By the way did have you asked yourself uh this is just a side-show have you asked yourself why I think we mentioned this things like raw beef and unboiled milk or untreated water or <ea/>mutura all those things that we mentioned the other time when we're talking about health beliefs Have you ever asked yourself why they don't affect those who eat them and if you try then you diarrhoea You don't \n<$B> Yes \n<$A> Sorry I mean then you are among the category who eats them But if I went and ate them yeah or I mean then there are people who are not used to those things maybe you are I don't know but if you know it's traditional when they are they areRRR slaughtering uh uh lamb or a cow or whatever then the <ea/>wazees are supposed to taste the <ea/>matumbo They take a bit of the liver as raw as it is and swallow it And they take a bit of uh the <ea/>kitabu that part that opens out like a book yeah I don't know what's it called And they swallow it And then they drink some of the blood and then whatever yeah It's supposed to bless the animal before you eat it yeah But if you went from Nairobi through you you've been through the university for four years then you finally go and this goat is being slaughtered for you Then you decide to taste as well You probably end up not eating that goat yeah For what reason It's not that you're not used to it And it's not that the man is stronger than you Why Thank you it's just the approach You know there's nothing wrong with drinking unboiled milk and there's nothing wrong with eating raw beef yeah Maybe there is I don't know but Mad-cow disease Those things don't exist That is <ea/>kazumba This is but have you ever seen a mad cow You have Where what was the origin of that disease actually Talking about people's health I did notice the response the British gave uh to that thing yeah Everybody shied away and McDonald's was losing business like crazy apart from the chicken burgers which they make Everybody stopped eating beef yeah that that's Where did that idea come from Of course there was no cow that went mad Do you remember how it started I don't myself That's why I'm asking you For once I don't have an answer to my own question like I always do How did it start <O_><O/> It was a virus What kind of virus No no I mean we hardly have any brains to destroy They should have sent it to wherever But anyway uh by way of summary on those traditions and health belief and whatever whatever uh Please remember uh and I think we've said this before that uh social and economic class usually determines traditional behaviour Yeah if you're a very rich person or if you live if you happen to belong to very uh uh uh high high social class yeah whatever then usually your traditional uh uh bias or traditional slant is reduced you know that yeah You you tend to ignore a lot of those things But if you are poor like me and you have many problems yeah then you probably go back to your home and try and start from there and find out what the problem is as you come back into Nairobi where life is so difficult yeah So social class and economic uh class both work together yeah to create traditional bias That bias determines health behaviour And that health behaviour determines the health status of either an individual or a community I think I'm done with you You <AmE/>guys are so boring yeah if you don't have any questions yeah", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '7abfa526-807a-4ce1-957b-a5e226b891c5', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.024224+00:00', 'english_score': 0.979682207107544,

{'text': "<$A> Last time we did our test isn't it uh You'll get them on Thursday uh You get the results back on Thursday Today let's continue with the expansions isn't it \n<$B> yes \n<$A> right and uh I must have given you an exercise for your homework right <$B>no \n<$A> I did not to expand some symbolic statement statements <O/> seems never did it <$C> I forgot\n<$A> You forgot It's terrible Okay Now today let's continue with expansions all right But today we want to look at uh symbolic oppositions which are overlapping quantifiers uh Okay so for instance okay Let's have that symbolic statement right okay and further for purposes let's limit our viable base also the discourse the universe of discourse to two things namely a and b okay So in our universe we have two things a and b okay Now these statements would mean that everything is let's take h to b happier Everything is happy everything in relation to anything else is happy isn't it okay which technically would be more <O/> therefore That a is happy to a isn't it and a is happy to b right one which have a combination and b is happy to a all right and the last combination is b is happy to itself isn't it Okay In other words in a two dimensional universe so to speak that is in a universe where we have two entities a and b all right than there are four possible combinations okay is a to a - a to b - b to a and last thing b to b okay or more simply more accurately All right if you are to be systematic all right we can partly Right We can first expand in relation to the first quantifier the x-quantifier right the first quantifier which is x right We can expand in relation to that quantifier first right And we are also still limiting our universe to two things right namely a b When we expand in relation to the universal quantifier x then what would we have isn't it That is in case where we expand in relation to the first quantifier x okay x We have a there and the b there seems we only have those two entities in our world in our universe so to speak And then secondly we can call back the first step and then secondly back we can go and now and expand it in relation to the second quantifier the y uh And there we have it as a is happy to a isn't it and h to b okay in other words And on the other end of it we have this okay So in other words it amounts to the same thing uh but it's good always to have those steps in mind all right Assuming we have the symbolic statement with three quantifiers those steps would still be very useful okay Another example uh let's have uh the symbolic statement This time let's introduce an existential quantifier okay Let's expand that again uh Again limiting our uh universe of discourse to two entities right just a and b right So here again let's do it step by step The first step let's <O/> in relation to the first quantifier right the universal x quantifier okay And what would we have We have statements okay all right And then our next step now is to expand it further in relation to the existential or the particular quantifier right limiting Bearing in mind that we are limiting it to just two things a and b So in our second step therefore What would we have We have *haa> and then or this time isn't it 'cause it's an existential quantifier or *hab> isn't it the other side we get it *hba> and then or *hb> There we are isn't it We come again all right uh uh right That's our statement isn't it okay And take note that in that statement now we have two different quantifiers isn't it universal and existential And take note of what we say to us when expanding using a universal quantifier which symbol do you use which symbol \n<$D> conjunction\n<$A> conjunction now uh the y it is the existential quantifier which symbol do you use <$D> disjunction\n<$A> disjunction right Now our first step in our step take note to get expanding these are the <O/> in relation to the universal quantifier isn't it uh And there we are saying uh we have so we raise universal quantifier and change predicate x to a and b take note we use the conjunction saying it is the universal quantifier in which we are expanding right Now in our second step now we are expanding in relation to the existential quantifier isn't it which means that or the symbol we use therefore is the disjunction right And here we are saying that h to either ba or to bb <O/> we are doing two things isn't it okay And the second side we also say that it could either be a or it could be b <O/> Alternatively assuming we have it Let's interplay the quantifiers right assume we have this symbolic expression right have now that symbolic expression and we want to expand it uh So we expand it first in relation to the existential quantifier isn't it as opposed to the other one right rather we expand it first saying it's the universal quantifier which was the first one So here first step What do we have hax and then or or right or hbx okay the universe we are limiting the universe to two things uh a and b And in our next step now we have to expand it in relation now to the universal quantifier So how would we have it now We have our haa isn't it and hab okay or hba and hbb uh So take note the way it differs second example Do I need to come again or it's you to come now okay let's look at this uh Yes let's have that one Who wants to give that a try Who wants a try that yes And as you do it explain it to them uh so that they follow you \n<$E> The first step now we want to do away with this one since our universe of discourse is limited to two elements \n<$A> yes uh \n<$E> so this one is an existential statement which I have where a a is happy with y or \n<$A> yes or \n<$E> yeah or b is happy with y I mean that b is happy with y\n<$A> yes <O/> think you for is it \n<$E> yeah\n<$A> yes or is it our thinking for you \n<$E> Now the second step is to do with the other quantifier which is still a existential quantifier For this reason alone we shall have to expand on this we have it first done the first step \n<$A> Therefore we shall have ha is happy with a or a is happy with b since <O/> <O/> existential and no matter <O/> <O/> this one which means that this one in bracket security reasons yes it seems to be secure [\n<$E> and then we have b is happy with a all right b is happy with itself\n<$A> right isn't it okay all right So take note he  says that we parenthesise these uh as he  says correctly for security reasons right Although we know that in our way since we are sent to give you the same isn't it okay Even if you omitted there is no logical difference okay just as much as I see the first example which I gave we were dealing with all of the conjunctions isn't it and possibly that's why I never put the parentheses okay The parentheses become very important when the symbols are different but there's no harm even in including them when we're using the same okay uh Let's look at one more or two more uh All right there we are Let's expand that <O/> somehow different in that it has a negation sign now isn't it okay But take note the negation sign tells us it is not the case it negates everything that follows isn't it okay So in a way we can just expand and then thereafter we negate whatever we have expanded all right So let's expand that for the time being ignore the negation sign And this one is the first one isn't it So again let's limit things in our universe right to a and b So first step we have it as this a and this b isn't it okay We're limiting our universal discourses two things right on this valuable x and on this a or b okay Then second step right we expand now in relation to other universal quantifier y so that in relation to a and <O/> universal quantifier that in relation to b and then as you brought it to attention for security purposes right parenthesise it The other side also we have b in relation to a and b in relation to b okay But take note that symbolic expression is negated So therefore what we do We negate the expansion isn't it And how we negate the expansion and that therefore becomes the expansion of that symbolic statement right Now take note that would be different isn't it we don't <O/> it uh it would be different isn't it What's the difference What would be the difference between this statement and the previous one or this expansion uh and the previous one The difference would be yes Yes we have its only base which is negated right and not the second major right But in that move the core statement is negated all right uh Let's look at this other one uh okay let's have that symbolic expression First step who wants to try that <O/> try it to myself or we go ahead okay Let's limit it to two universe discourse right So first let's expand it in relation to the first existential quantifier So what we have uh sorry ha and then and or or okay Have I forgotten something What have I forgotten the y uh Then our second step to expand in relation to the second existential quantifier So what we have ha in relation to a itself or ha in relation to b all right or hb in relation to a or b in relation to itself isn't it Am I clear all right yes all right uh Lastly I want one of you to do this before we move on yes who'll do that Let's be a bit gender sensitive now uh two <O/> here so we have the two we want you to succeed in your in your desire uh \n<$F> okay the first step uh sorry so excited to do that <O/> \n<$A> right the universal \n<$F> so I will have uh you see the a and \n<$A> yeah \n<$F> then because it's universal uh because it's the uh expanding to the universal uh dimension with the second step\n<$A> yeah \n<$F> uh we consider it the extension so\n<$A> yeah so the a \n<$F> we call it the \n<$A> right \n<$F> then we we call it the existential \n<$A> right isn't it okay right uh uh Take down this right okay During your own free time right I tell you to do those four all right And here of course again limit your universal discourse to two entities right a and b yes \n<$?> expand \n<$A> sorry \n<$A> yes you are saying the same thing isn't it By the rule isn't it right 'cause by the rule we know that this and this are the same right It negates that and change the conjunction to a disjunction So you end up with that same because the <O/> is an equivalence rule isn't it We are saying from this you can do this and the vice versus way okay is possible all right Now the question to ask now is why the expansion You know the expansions are important especially when it comes to proving invalidity okay of symbolic arguments right something very cardinal In other words we want to say within predicate logic right the predicate logic right if and when you are given uh an argument and you are asked or required to prove its invalidity then the very first step which you must do is expand the argument okay", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a0dc7b8c-e8f8-4169-b169-d64f603ebfa9',

{'text': "<$A> So we'd like to continue What I'd like to do today is that if possible we wind up and then uh so you can use can useRRR tomorrow's hour to prepare for uh our test And uh so we have enough questions uh There are eleven questions to choose from So that should not be a problem Uh No in the main exam Uh and in the I mean in the CAT we agreed that there are going to be twenty isn't it Yeah so uh uh there'll be twenty So if you had to do the eleven that would be good enough I'll choose four I'll choose four from those ones So we were looking at uh polar oppositions uh We looked at polar oppositions I think we were through with that one Where did we end Uh Speaker related Oh okay So we didn't finish So we have been looking at these uh oppositions for example we are trying to look at uh a logical way in which we can characterise uh semantic relations or the semantic the uh uh relations within the a sentence so that we can be able to deduce meaning We are trying to find out for example how do speakers uh uh uh characterise the meanings of sentences How are they able to interpret sentences Now we know that uh this is something that is learned by the speaker And if the speaker learns to distinguish the meanings not only of words but also of sentences then we also know that uh there is some uh logical basis upon which we can explain it So the patterns of the The nature of semantic oppositions that we are trying to characterise is to enable us to find a logical basis to explain the semantic meanings of sentences Now the question is Is it possible for us to work out a theory of semantics which logically and uh conclusively explains the semantic meanings of sentences Now we find that the theory that we have been looking at is what is referred to as componential analysis And that componential analysis tries to for example reduce the meanings of sentences the meanings of words into features and that these features as we said are binary That uh the presence of one feature necessarily excludes the other Now this is uh a way of uh analysing for example meaning in the same way as uh we analyse the contrastiveness of sounds in language But for us to be able to understand the relations between sounds in language and the manner in which speakers distinguish sounds from one another it is necessary for us to identify features which we can use for example to uh characterise such distinctions So the features that we use in phonology for example are the distinctive features of sounds and uh we can use the same methodology to characterise semantic distinctiveness or semantic contrasts by means of these features and the model that allows us to do that is what we are referring to as componential analysis Now we were looking at polar oppositions and we said that uh when we look at uh these kinds of oppositions for example of the type old and young rich and poor uh we can see that they are more less they are not fixed They can be characterised on the point of view of a scale that uh we for example start from a particular point and from there we can go progressively towards one end that is uh different for example uh categorisations of uh rich and then on the other extreme you can go towards different uh categorisations of poor and so on But we also noted that uh it is not possible for us to fix a norm which is uh which is true for all cases of rich or poor It is not possible for us to do that because different people depending on their for example cultural or social experiences will have different uh perceptions of what constitutes rich or poor Now for this reason therefore we said that the norm keeps on changing depending on the person Now if the norm keeps on changing And that the norm is what enables the speaker to make a judgement with respect to meaning The question is how does he therefore uh conceptualise or how does he understand what is meant by rich or poor when he comes across it in a particular sentence Now uh it is for this reason that we said that uh different speakers may have different ways of uh understanding For example if we were to say that so and so is rich and then we ask somebody how much wealth does this particular person have we find that to different people the amount of wealth that the person have uh uh has that will enable him to be characterised as being rich may differ So for example to some people it may be somebody who has got so much money to others uh money including so many other assets and so on and so forth We also said that in the case of uh age we can talk about uh When we talk of young and old that uh so and so is young we'll have uh different uh uh uh perceptions to different people and the reason is that uh when we are referring to a particular kind of situation for example an athlete When we say so and so is a young athlete then we can uh the kind of uh imagination that we can uh have with respect to this particular person would be that uh this is probably somebody who is in his uh uh uh early uh uh uh uh for example from his uh uh from uh the age is such as uh eighteen maybe to twenty-five and so on and so forth But when we talk we use the same kind of uh uh adjective with respect to the a word such as president or a word uh such as archbishop Then we find that uh the perception that we get of a young president or a young archbishop would uh give us the picture of somebody much older Now the reason that uh a young athlete will be conceptualised as somebody much younger than a young president is simply that uh our everyday experiences show that uh athletes are much more youthful persons than presidents and since uh presidents are generally in uh office during the later years of uh their lives then a young president would probably be somebody who is in the age between forty and fifty or uh sixty and so on and so forth So it is this therefore that tells us that uh it is not possible with polar relations to fix a norm from which we can constantly relate the other uh uh uh positions within the particular relation that if we want to relate the different positions they will differ depending for example on the speaker depending also on the situation And this is what determines the manner in which we interpret these situations So we stopped at the sentence Some polar oppositions are not only object-related but also speaker-related isn't it Yeah so we can continue from there and uh wind up with this one \nSo next we look at uh relative oppositions relative oppositions Now this is another type of uh binary opposition and uh it involves uh a contrast in direction For example if we look at uh uh terms such as up and down or uh above below uh before and after and so on and so forth All these are contrast used in English to indicate for example uh uh a relation which uh involves a direction so that when we say up or down really we are referring to up in relation to a specific kind of norm or down in relation to a specific kind of norm Now these contrasts therefore are also uh uh binary and that uh we can the fact that we have got a norm uh from which we make a relation of what constitutes up or what constitutes down uh also shows that uh we can use them for example as uh binary contrasts Now as we have said uh these terms can also not be used as absolute kind of representations of uh what constitutes up or down simply because of the fact that as we have said we have to have a certain norm from which we relate or from which we indicate what what constitutes uh what is uh uh up or down and uh uh or what is above or below and so on And that uh it is the norm that we fix uh that uh will enable us for example to be able to assess or to fix what constitutes up and what constitutes down or what constitutes uh left or what constitutes right Now some of these relations can also be used for example to relate entities for example uh which are in a uh uh uh relation of uh for example uh a relation by virtue of marriage or a relation by virtue of birth and so on and so forth So that when we say that John is the parent of or John is the father of John uh John is the father of Joseph we are also implying something else that uh Joseph is the child of and that uh this kind of uh these kinds of relations therefore not only exist by virtue of the fact that we can make one statement but also that whenever we make a particular statement we are also implying uh the existence of the other that when we say that John is the father of Joseph we are also implying and that is what the speaker and also the listener come to understand that if John is the father of Joseph then Joseph is the child of and that that is a kind of necessary uh uh relation between the two persons Now this is also similar when we talk about uh Adam is the husband of Eve But uh when we use this kind of statement we are also implying that uh Eve is also is the wife of Adam and so on and so forth So the question is since the two sentences are synonymous in terms of meaning how do we represent them that if we say Adam is the husband of Eve and Eve is the wife of the two sentences would be I mean would be understood to mean the same thing by this by the listener How do we then uh represent the two meanings since uh uh especially because of the fact that we are dealing with uh two different kinds of syntactic uh structures Now we have considered for example when we were looking at uh synonymy that uh we may be dealing with uh different words but which mean the same thing Now in this case we are dealing with two different uh uh sentences syntactically but which mean the same thing uh semantically that is to the speaker these two sentences would be assumed to refer to the same thing Now because of this therefore we find that it is necessary for us to interpret as the I mean to interpret the syntactic order of the words in the sentence as really meaning the same thing and that uh in order to represent this kind of uh this kind of uh representation then we need to use for example a feature for example the semantic feature that would uh want to use uh parent uh which in this case covers both father and mother and that when we say that John is the parent a parent is the parent of Joseph we're also saying that uh Joseph is also necessarily a son uh uh uh of John and so on And in this case we need to use a feature what which can be able to represent these two relations because of the fact that they are uh uh they represent the same meaning So to do this we can use this with the arrow and that uh it uh for example and that we can use this uh uh uh this feature as uh that is the feature uh uh is uh parent and that parent can be used either way uh because the important uh uh thing that we want to show here is that uh we are using features contrastively and therefore in order to use features contrastively it has to be uh uh possible for us to use one and the same feature but uh that we can interpret it uh uh either of two ways That is to mean that uh either John is the parent of or Joseph is the child of Then we need to use to devise features which we can use uh binarily that uh with one sign this feature will tell us one particular information and that when we change the sign then it will also tell us the opposite information because of the fact that uh uh I mean because of the existence of the synonymy in these kinds of uh sentences", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a96f0e69-8b70-485a-9145-5326e5d38cc5', 'added':

{'text': "<$A> Okay we want to move on to the next topic and that is uh monopoly Now monopoly just like uh perfect competition is uh a market structure structure which is only in theory It's only in theory Pure monopoly refers to a market structure in which there is only one supplier of a commodity for which there is no close substitute Pure monopoly we are saying is a market structure in which there is only one supplier of a commodity for which there is uh no close substitute\nUnder A Barriers to entry That means that you cannot just enter this market Now barriers to entry and that is perhaps where we only have one uh supplier In this market structure we have uh many buyers okay The people who buy it So the buyers are many but the supplier of the product is just one as we said Now because uh we have no close substitutes for this product it means that if the price of the commodity increases okay if the price of the commodity increases then you would not observe that is there will be no significant increase in the price in the demand there will be no significant increase in the demand for any other product okay We are saying that because there are no close substitutes to the commodity under this market structure If the price increases for this product there will be no significant increase in the demand for any other product because uh there will be no shifting you know You cannot shift from this product to another because it doesn't have uh close substitutes Now although pure monopoly is only in theory there are situations when firms we are saying that uh monopoly is just in theory but there are cases where many firms or countries would come together and form a collusion over prices or production levels over prices or production levels and in this way act as a monopolist In this way they will act as monopolists That is you have uh many firms coming together or many countries coming together to collude or to act in collusion over prices and uh sometimes on production levels And in that way you see they will act like a monopolist For example the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries The Organisation of uh Petroleum Exporting Countries These are countries which produce and export oil So they have come together to form what we call uh a cartel So you see in that way even if uh there are many countries producing an exporting oil when they come together like that they can sometimes restrict the production level sometimes they can raise the price and in that way they will be acting like a monopolist So you see as much as you may not only have one country doing that even if there are many if they come together they can form what uh something similar to monopoly as a market structure Now these uh OPEC the oil uh Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries sometimes in the early nineteen seventies they came together and uh reduced the oil production on the world market and the price of oil increased so much that there was inflation all over the world okay Because of what they did they restricted the oil production and therefore the supply on the world market was lower And uh in that way the price increased And the impact was to cause inflation because oil is used in many other sectors So when the price increased for oil many other products will be affected And of course prices tend to move in the same direction \nNext let's look at courses of uh monopoly power Courses Causes of monopoly power \nNow the first cause of monopoly power is ownership of strategic raw materials ownership of strategic raw materials or exclusive knowledge of production processes or exclusive knowledge of production processes So sometimes a firm may act as a monopolist because it is the only firm which owns a particular raw material or which has exclusive knowledge of production of a particular item And then it will have a monopoly power For example during the Gulf War the Iraqi uh government thought that there is no enemy who knew about the Scud missile because this is a missile which will be sent from far and is very accurate in uh hitting that the target So the Scud missile the Iraqi people thought there were the only ones who knew about it its use and that you don't have to be near the enemy So they can send it from far On the other hand the allied forces the Americans had uh the Patriot The Patriot is uh an anti-missile missile So that means it will intercept the Scud missile But that you know it will only be effective if it does soar before reaching the target So it has to be somewhere in the middle and that means that uh the Patriot has to be sent just immediately the Scud missile has been sent so that they meet somewhere in the middle where nothing will be destroyed It won't hit the enemy So the Patriot which is an anti-missile missile the Iraq people didn't know about it So you see they knew if the enemy doesn't know about the Scud missile they will make it you know They wouldn't have to be close to fight So you can do it from far But the Patriot can also intercept it before it hits the target So uh uh then it is because of the war the Gulf War that now you see countries came to know about the two Before that then nobody knew about it So it is a strategic information which you have to keep until uh when need arises So it will be an example okay of a strategic uh uh knowledge okay some exclusive knowledge about uh production of these two uh missiles So ownership of strategic raw materials and the exclusive knowledge about production processes can be a form of a monopoly power okay You become the only one \nAnd then the other form of monopoly power Number two is uh the case of copyrights and uh patents \nNow what are patents Patents would uh give uh the only production rights the only production rights to the person who has invented a particular product for a given time period Now so what does is it gives you the right to be the only producer because of the research you've done because of the investments you have made into coming up with that particular product So because you've done so much in terms of research you've spent so much money to come up with that product so a patent will give you the right to be the only producer okay of that product for some time okay Most likely for you to be able to recover say the money you've spent the time you've put in before others could be allowed to do so So you see if you have a patent over a production of a particular item then that stops others from imitating now what you have producing the same uh thing A copyright of course is very similar to a patent uh Here the a copyright would restrict the reproduction of uh printed or recorded material you know printed or recorded material So it is specific on uh the item It is printed It could be a book a paper you presented somewhere or some recorded material like cassettes for example okay musical cassettes would be an example So you have a copyright over that That means then you become the only uh producer of that particular material just in a similar way like a patent because of the research you you've put in okay because of the knowledge you've put in to come up with it for a specific period of time and uh idea the purpose would be to enable you recover the costs okay of uh the investment you've put in Many books you look at them and you'll see who holds uh that copyright It could be the author or the publisher could be the ones who are holding it And uh and it would restrict the reproduction of any material you know in that book or on the cassette itself for a specific period of time and some times indefinite okay so that you should not reproduce any part of that without permission from say the author or the publisher whoever holds the copyrights But of course many times people just go on to photocopy you know books without uh they don't even bother to know whether there is some copyright somewhere But it should uh give somebody the monopoly power to be the only producer of uh the item okay So then the second uh point we've made is that the case of patents and copyrights who would give uh or create monopoly power\nNumber three the other uh source of monopoly power is uh government licensing or the imposition of foreign trade barriers \nGovernment licensing that is you see the law you know the government law uh may require that there'll be only one supplier of a particular product in the market So you see the law may require that there'll be only one producer one supplier of a product in the market For example now here in Kenya you see initially we had a law which required that there'll be only one co-operation in the form of Kenya Power and Lighting Company which would be the only supplier of electricity So you see even if we are able to uh generate electricity then the law would uh stop you from doing that you know So with the Kenya Power and Lighting Company is an example of uh uh a monopolist in the form of supplying electricity in Kenya Now is it it's not exactly pure monopoly because we have got other sources of energy you know apart from electricity we have got other sources of energy However you see in terms of electricity itself then Kenya Power and Lighting Company would be a monopolist in supplying electricity in the country And uh sometimes uh these laws may go beyond the boundaries of the country They can stop the importation of uh products from outside in that uh way you see you're cutting away any foreign products coming in to compete with the local ones In many cases the reason is you want to protect you know the local producers And the local producers could just be one So you are creating and strengthening monopoly by stopping foreign goods from coming in to compete with the locally produced ones Of course what's happening at the moment is that uh we are moving away from monopoly to free our market structures okay Colonies are opening up but we just trying to give examples of where monopoly can be created by law in the country\nNumber four another source of monopoly power is uh the size of the market the size of the market\nNow the size of the market may be suitable for only one supplier The size of the market may be suitable for only one supplier one optimum firm You see the technology being used the technology being used uh may indicate or may show economies of scale if only one firm is in operation <O/> being used to the saying may indicate economies of scale which would be enjoyed only if only one firm is in operation Now an example again could be uh electricity Electricity would be an example of a case where in that market economies of scale would be enjoyed only if there is only one firm because if there are two firms then you'll have two lines in the same area say one line serving the say from the Kenya Power and Lighting Company and then another one from another source another supplier It is uh uneconomical if we were to maintain two lines you know Two suppliers in the market so you have two lines of electricity One belonging to one firm and than another to another firm supplying the same item The economies of scale would not be enjoyed you know It becomes very expensive in terms of uh resource use for the whole economy for the whole country and it becomes uneconomical", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> Another source of monopoly power number five The pricing policy the pricing policy of the existing firm The pricing policy of the existing firm may be such that it prevents new entrance into the market The pricing policy of the existing firm may be such that it prevents entrance of new firms in the market or the industry The pricing policy here you see the prices may have been set quite low and uh that price is affordable by a firm which is producing on a very large scale a firm which is well established So the prices could be kept low to keep away uh new prospective firms in the market You see the price would have been kept very low so that new firms would not afford to enter without making losses So you see uh new entrance prospective entrance are kept away from this market because of low prices that are charged by a firm which is well established in the market Sometimes uh these uh pricing policy may be combined with uh advertising you know heavy advertising And if sometimes you know we've just told that this is the only product you recommended So the chances are that new <O/> will find it very difficult to penetrate uh in this market if uh the existing firm is charging very low prices advertising very heavily and uh the message is like this is the only known product new products will find it very difficult to sell in such a market And uh in that way you see uh new firms would not enter this market structure or will find it very difficult Sometimes the other policy that can be used by the existing firm is to keep uh changing the nature of the product supplied on the market That is uh continuous product differentiation continuous product differentiation They keep changing the product And so you see you'll find it very difficult to cope as a new uh supplier if you are to enter this market So we are saying that the existing firm may adopt this policy of uh continuing to differentiate the product to keep changing the product okay So in that way they can keep off the other uh potentially uh firms in uh the industry \nAnd then finally number six another source of monopoly power is uh heavy initial costs heavy initial costs The initial costs may be very high And uh what it implies is that to begin with you make very heavy losses To begin with you make very heavy losses So for a firm to enter such an industry or for a firm to enter that uh kind of market it will require a lot of resources It'll require a lot of resources which may not be available which may not be available So then that becomes a barrier you know to new firms entering that industry New firms will find it very difficult to enter because of uh heavy initial uh resources required and the fact that to begin with you make a lot of uh losses or very heavy losses And so you see maybe when that firm was establishing there were uh resources available There were say some donors who were willing to uh sponsor such an investment uh the moment they <O/> uh readily available So that will stop uh new firms from entering such a market structure leaving there only one supplier of a product which will have no close substitutes And that is what we would refer to as monopoly So then those would be the sources of monopoly power okay Those are uh sources of monopoly power\nNow the other bit of uh a market structure which we want to look at is a situation where you have uh a monopolist who'll be selling in different markets at different prices That is a discriminating uh monopolist So before we move on to the analysis of uh a monopolist uh market structure sharing the demand the <O/> we want to look at a discriminating monopolist situation A monopolist may be able to charge different prices to different consumers of similar commodities in different markets A monopolist may be able to charge different prices to different consumers of similar commodities in different markets Now you know this is what we refer to as price discrimination So a monopolist will be selling a similar or the same product in different markets to different consumers at different prices Of course in one market the price will be higher and then in another market the price will be lower The purpose of uh price discrimination here would be to maximise profits The purpose of price discrimination would be to maximise profits Okay so the purpose of price discrimination is to maximise total profits for the monopolist How can price discrimination be practised How can you uh price discriminate That means you've got to be able to separate the two markets Okay what is been sold in one market should not be transferred to other market at some profit at some margin So we want to look at uh ways in which markets can be separated Ways in which markets can be separated okay Ways in which markets can be separated\nNumber one is geographically Now the best example here is where you find a single producer of a product who sells in both the local market and some foreign market So you find a single producer of a product who sells in both the local market and a foreign market So this supplier of a product uh simply sells here uh say in Kenya and also exports part of the product to another country So here you have a single producer of a product who also exports outside the country Now what may be the case is that the item on the export market will be sold at a different price from the price which is charged on the local market on the local market In many cases the price in the export market is higher than the price on the local market In many cases we are saying the price on the local market I mean on the export market would be higher than that on the local market So this uh monopolist will be charging a higher price to uh foreigners in that uh export market and then a lower price on the local market or the home market Now sometimes even if those people in the export market know about this okay They know that in the home market it is cheaper the transport costs you know of coming to buy from here may cancel out that difference okay may cancel out that difference so that uh if you are to come and buy here then you don't gain anything okay you don't gain anything But the exporter himself or herself because of the large quantities involved would still uh benefit from that uh difference in uh the transport costs okay So because of uh distance because of the distance that is <O/> different places uh a monopolist is able to price discriminate in the home market from the export market The other source of uh power to discriminate price number two is by type of demand by type of demand An example for example the demand for milk The example we are giving here is the case of milk Now milk we have uh two types of demand The household use of milk and the industrial use of milk which they uh process it into other products like cheese And so in the case of say our own country Kenya for quite some time there was only one firm in the milk industry which would uh buy milk from farmers process it and uh distribute it to the consumers KCC the Kenya Co-operative Creameries So as a monopolist in that area they would charge a lower price to household consumers and then a higher price to the industrial users of milk Now the idea here is on *affordebility> Who can afford to pay more The industrial users of milk can afford to pay a higher price for the same milk yeah than the household consumers So you see how much you can afford is looked at  as> by a monopolist But again uh the industrial users of milk cannot buy the milk used by households you know to use it for processing because uh some of the elements have already been removed by the time it reaches the household consumers So the same milk could not be used for the same purpose uh by the industrial uh users And so the KCC can comfortably you know discriminate price between household consumers and the industrial consumers because of the nature of the milk you know it's not the same that they offer for sale to the two different groups of uh consumers\nAnother source of price discrimination number three is by time by time the best example here is uh in transport in transport In transport they charge uh a higher price during the peak hours and then a lower price in the off peak hours In our own country uh public transport in urban areas would either be by <ea/>matatus or busses and in Nairobi in particular would be KBS KBS could be very good at that I don't know about the <ea/>matatu but I think they also do the same But sometimes they also take advantage of situations like when it has rained you know they'll charge a higher price than when it is not when it hasn't Uh so what we see then is uh see they can discriminate uh by time you know In the morning people have to go to work In the evening they have to go back home So those are the peak hours So you can charge a higher price without uh uh making any losses because people have to go During the day people have got a choice to make you know The numbers of people wants have reduced and then it's like the means of transport are so many people have got a choice to make So that time then the price is lowered the price is lowered So the off-peak hours they pay less The price is lower than during the peak hours And so you can discriminate by time\nAnd then finally number four discrimination could also be by the nature of the product You see the nature of the product can also allow you to price discriminate And the best example is uh the case of medical treatment You see doctors uh uh can discriminate so well when it comes to medical treatment because uh you see with medical treatment it is very difficult to transfer the treatment you have received somewhere else So even if you have the same problem two people and uh you know that you'll be charged a lower price and the next person will be charged a higher price and he's going to pay You cannot receive a treatment and then transfer it to the next person Sometimes if it is drugs you know you can be told to begin there So you take two and you fall ill you've already disturbed the dose You've already taken two on yourself And another thing the best example again would be in the same medical treatment if it's an injection okay so they'll give you an injection there so you cannot transfer the same to another person who'll be willing to pay a higher price So doctors would charge you according to how much you can afford Uh I was talking to an doctor who had uh he's a surgeon so he had operated on two people a housewife and an accountant okay The housewife for the same condition paid five thousand and then the accountant was charged twenty-five thousand for the same condition okay So this is how we explain You see he let the housewife choose what she can afford which is five thousand but the accountant has a lot of money parts of which is just to obtain business friends So there is no problem charging five thousand twenty-five thousand After all he had the money in fact in the pocket and he could comfortably pay for it So you can compensate and the poor could also benefit from this charging a high fee to the rich and then a lower for the poor \nS2BLEC1K\n<$A> During the lecture we're going to have a bit of recording so I would like you not to get conscious self-conscious We'll continue with the lecture as usual with little interceptions and intercessions so now let's go back let's start it from the first set of lectures and we discover so look at your notes that you make sure what you have is what we did Now the first question we investigated was what was permanent existence okay what is permanent existence and we looked at the early Ionian philosophers so we  looked at Thales we looked at Anaximander we looked at Anaximenes At the end of the lecture we tried to find out what was the importance of the Miletians yeah Anaximander Anaximenes and Thales And we said to our knowledge these philosophers were first the first ones to have brought into attention the question of permanent existence were the first ones to question what is everything what is the stuff that everything is made of Two we said these philosophers were important because again to our knowledge they seem to have been the first to express scientific concern and do so in their philosophy We said if we are to investigate these philosophers we will note that they did not form hypotheses in the modern manner And therefore the yardstick that we might use to look at the work of whom of Thales cannot be the same yardstick that we use to look at the work of for example Hobbes who comes much later yeah not only because they did not form hypotheses in the modern manner not only because they did not have access to modern scientific technologies and knowledge but also because most of the works most of the ideas that we assume to be theirs are not given to us by them but they come to us second hand and also because the come in bits and pieces and therefore we say they're fragments And then we note that these philosophers did not present positive assertions sorry presented positive assertions i e they seem to have said this is the truth rather than tentative suggestions They did not say maybe Maybe the stuff that everything is made of is water They said everything comes from water everything is from the indeterminate boundless We note that the Miletians seem not to have distinguished between spirit and body And maybe because of these they do not refer to that relation if there is any between body and spirit And then we note that maybe also because of their lack of distinction between body and spirit they reduce everything to a material factor Another major theme is that we find that for the Miletians everything all reality is reduced to one Now if this is if we look at all these points we seem to have quite a bit of negatives weighing against the union philosophers But what importance are they to us and to the history of philosophy For us as I've said just before the importance is they made that first step into the inquiry of what nature is really made of After that we investigated Heracleitos And what was the question that Heracleitos introduced to philosophy\nWhat was the question that Heracleitos introduced to the history of philosophy \nThe question of change okay Kahara how did he try to resolve the question of change How did he do this <name/> He tried to find out not he in observing we find that Heracleitos sees that although the earlier philosophers have claimed that reality is one this reality changes and therefore he tries to look not just for that which changes but the principle of change itself okay And he finds this principle in that characteristic that he calls the characteristic of flux and therefore the world is an ever-living fire whereby fire gives fire takes We noted that in his discussion of change of flux he introduces the question of justice He says that there is a fair exchange for everything that is taken in the flux something equal is given We found out that he introduced an important aspect into philosophy the aspect of reason as universal law In his explanation he also introduced and discussed the conflict of opposites which he said is the basis of change Therefore with the first with reason he seeks to explain that change is not haphazard It doesn't just happen It happens to some order to some reason to some rule With the conflict of opposites he tries to demonstrate to explain what the essence of change is We found out that the first the first part of his theory that is reason as universal law was to have a major influence in Western political thought It was to have a major influence on the Stoics and it has continued to have a major influence on the theory of natural law Next we looked at Parmenides Sorry before that we looked at Pythagoras I looked at Pythagoras and the Pythagorean society and we found that for them everything could be reduced into what <name/>Kamonde Into numbers thank you And we looked at his explanation of the three kinds of people which he based on the Olympic games and which he uses to illustrate a thinker a proper thinker We have the profit makers we have the competitors and we have the observers and we discovered that for him the observer is the philosopher For the Pythagorean society we discovered that he or he and his society thought that if you're a proper observer a proper philosopher you will find out that everything like he has said consist of numbers and these numbers are contained within fields that he's among the first to begin relating the sciences the arts emerging into a philosophy But for the society they discover a relationship between arithmetic and geometry that they introduce the wheel of birth into philosophy The wheel of birth is an idea that we see has influence both in Western and more so in Eastern philosophy We find that they take their they take philosophy to the realm of music also and use music to explain philosophy <name/> yes\n<$A> The wheel of birth introduce the idea of the wheel of birth because we said that they were concerned with the study of purification and mortality yeah immortality mortality and immortality\nAnd this was mainly so with the study of the soul yeah so what new element has been introduced there <name/>\nWhat new element has been introduced by the Pythagoreans The Pythagoreans tried to introduce the aspects of the soul its liberation its purification and the civil liberation as contained within that wheel of birth cycle\nSo we find that not only in philosophy but the Pythagoreans in other fields have a major impact They were the first ones to discover the mathematical aspect in music They were the first ones it is claimed to discover the idea of the hypothesis in mathematics They introduced the aspect of harmony in the universe harmony in health They introduced the aspect of balance within harmony between good and evil rest and motion one and many who is to be excused sorry\nbut I said by said byRRR who is it Kamonde the impact and the impact is in their explanation that everything is based on number In science which was later which and this was a theory that was to be used later they introduced the aspect of field yeah points and field Now their the impact was in who the later influenced We find that Plato used the ideal of the Pythagoreansinhis division of society into three And into what three groups did Pythagoras divide Sorry uh when Plato adapts the theory of the Pythagoreans into what three groups does he divide society Kite into what three classes does he divide I beg your pardon you were waving in the last lecture in Dr <name/> lectures where you did political philosophy Plato's political philosophy Did you read The Republic as recommended to you as asked of you\nI beg your pardon\nDid you read The Republic Moira what three classes does Plato debate to set in an ideal republic\n\nWho can remember the three the rational element okay So who are those Who are the three classes\nPhilosophers amongst who we get the philosopher king okay\nIt was with Pythagoras that the importance of the soul is brought out and also the importance of mathematics to forming forms Immediately after we looked at Parmenides And with Parmenides there's a reversion sort of to the earlier philosophers There's an insistence that there is no change that being is one that appearance and reality may and often conflict The appearance will often cheat us as to what reality is and therefore that being simply is and that being is one And if this is so that plurality is an illusion Change is what is this illusion and this is why he gives the arguments that if anything comes to be then it comes out of being or out of not being and nothing can come out of not being and if it comes out of being then it already was and therefore and his catchphrase cover \n\nBecoming is an illusion only being is real okay So if anything comes to be it either comes out of being or out of not being Nothing can come out of not being and if anything comes out of being then it already was therefore it did not come from anywhere So what is his catchphrase the line that helps us to remember Parmenides\nanother one Nothing comes from nothing okay We find that he insisted on a very radical distinction between truth and belief Belief he says is mainly based on the senses which often cheat and it is belief that seems to tell us that there is change yet there can be no change because change is unthinkable and inexpressible and change is impossible because there's only one single substance behind everything Now we find that Parmenides and his student Zeno did not seek to tell us what the substance is really They just say it's being So philosophy is being raised from the aspect of the material that reality is water reality is fire that's a material thing to another level We're now entering the metaphysical level in in philosophy And therefore we find for him and his major importance to us is that distinction that we have mentioned the distinction between way of truth way of believe or opinion with appearance we see change with uh sorry with uh the senses with opinion we perceive of appearance and see change and it is appearance that produces opinion while reality only produces truth And it's this opinion that sees and tells us there's flux there's change while reason and reality reason and reality will allow us to design truth And this truth will lead us to knowing that there is only a single substance of which everything consists i e there is no movement Now what's its importance Uh he made he seems to maybe have borrowed a bit from the early philosophers from Thales in the sense that Thales had conceived of everything as water but if everything is water then things appear differently then maybe appearance doesn't tell us the truth So maybe there's a borrowing of ideas from before to be used in the present i e from the times of Thales to be used in the times of Pythagoras He's important because he introduces the aspect of appearance and reality a question that is to be investigated in philosophy until the present time He seems to have influenced Plato as we have said not only in the division of society and people but also in his distinction of what is intelligible and visible i.e between the intelligible world and the visible world and therefore theory of forms which I'm told you looked at last week \nS2BLEC2K\n<$A> Uh let's uh come back to our mnemonic devices Last time we defined what mnemonic devices for are for improving our attention or improving memory so uh this uh afternoon I'd like to continue with it and uh give you some examples Last time I used a imagery method Remember the case of uh uh trying to teach about imagery or improving the memory where you are using uh like it is in languages You can use the picture and then you write the name against it so that you look at the picture of whatever item one is looking at and then you put the name against that I gave you the case of a banana and you know with the yellow colour and a shape and a name against that like the name of cheese you know for <O/> This morning I would like to give you another way and this is the chain method the chain method which is also known as the link method and this is uh uh a method where sometimes you want to improve like if you want to make three journeys to a place in town Sometimes now I give you if you do not uh prepare your memory for aid You may not be able to remember you may get to one and don't remember the other places you are supposed to go to So you know you may want to create a visual you know imagery so that you remember the three places you are going to For example you want to go to a bookstore you want to go to a supermarket you want to go to a post office so you may decide well you have something drawn showing the three journeys you are going to make and one is uh uh a book sale inside a supermarket right and within the supermarket you may have uh a corner somewhere where it is written a special postal area So we mean that you still you go and you pick your items from the book sale then you move to the supermarket you buy what you want also within within the same place so you remember to go to the three places by the same time Now another one is the keyword method the keyword method and uh the keyword method what it does to use to improve your memories like you try to use associations between new words and familiar words that sound the same I'll come back use associations between new words between new words and familiar words that sound the same\nLike if you've got a language like Spanish and the word for duck in Spanish is <foreign/>pato yeah so we just pronounce <foreign/>pato that right now our keyword in this method mnemonic method is pot We all know pot so for us to be able to remember that word one may have to create a visual imagery whereby you draw the picture of the duck with the pot upon over his head So that when you look at it you remember that because this one is uh sounding like pot so pot becomes our keyword So when you look at that kind of uh diagram you remember what it stands for The last one I want to mention is something we are all familiar with and this is what we call the acronyms And that one we are familiar with it a is a word which is formed from the first letters like in our case our university's uh KU Kenyatta University now and we have got many others KISE Kenya Institute of Special Education KIE KIE Kenya Institute of Education and uh you keep on uh shortening all that so the meaning you use that is an acronym and you remember that name which helps you to remember Now having said that then uh I want to move on something you know moves on to something else which is still related to memory and these are the basic basic principles for improving memory basic principles for improving memory There're at least four basic principles four basic principles One is attention In order to improve memory we need to increase interest in our learners and focus their attention to whatever is being taught or to improve memory We need to increase the attention and the interest of our learners and focus on the interest of what is being taught So we as teachers we are supposed to select a study environment which does not distract them 'cause we are talking about attention So if you want to pay attention to what is being taught you need that quiet environment where there isn't a disturbance So whatever is being taught you can hear it without noise interfering with it or people moving around and that's why sometimes when we arrange learning environments sometimes we've got a way of constructing classrooms <#/>We have seen in most of ours cause now uh depending on where it is you have found that the windows sometimes are higher on one side where there is disturbance and lower on the other side where there isn't a disturbance We're not talking about a hall like this one but uh that's why we know to minimise the no the that distraction of the their attention they are to pay So you listen to everything You can actually process a information and you see if it makes sense Two is organisation So we are saying that memo our memory is like a huge library It is like a huge library and so for us to retrieve the information in the long-term memory it has to be organised in the systematic way For us to retrieve that information from our long-term memory it has to be organised in the systematic way So we are saying now when we are teaching for attention and proper retrieval that information has to be organised in such a way that you know where you started and where it ends in between there has to be outlines there has to be divisions for these people to get the information So we are thinking now if you want to visualise it is like the way the library is If you work in the library and you don't know what catalogues are there you may find it you may take too long to find your books but if you know what catalogues there are you first move to that section because you know the the title or their name the title of the book and the name of the author So using that you can go to any shelf and you pick any book if it is there So that is what the same way we are saying now for to in order to help our learners or students in the schools to be able to retrieve or return the information they have learned it has to be organised And this is what this is the key now to the work the that's why we teach you in instructional methods to prepare lessons what we call the lesson plans that's why you have to start as in a particular way which your object is and whatever you want these people to learn and then in between what we are going to teach and how you are going to present it and how you are going to summarise it and how you are going to evaluate it you know whether the learners have learned or not okay The other principle is association association We are saying that uh you know there is need to associate new information with our own experiences There is need to associate new information with our own experiences So and this is this is now is especially new experiences is very key toward uh the object talked about In saying make the environment reach let the children manipulate and it's not just the young children but also for the other learners in the secondary schools they need that experience as much of information as possible for them to feel to see to touch to read so that whatever is being taught can be associated with people's experiences when you like with the young children we are saying if we are talking about a banana what does a banana look like why is it yellow why are some yellow why are others green and are they all yellow when they are ripe when they are ripe are they all are there some which are you know other colours when they are ripe so and what are they used for So this what we are saying now they need that association for the information again to be retrieved or to be returned of their memory The last principle is the rehearsal rehearsal And with rehearsal we are talking about practise the need to practise the information which has been taught in the class room and it you know you have to remember as teachers to avoid what we call the must-practice we trying to think about rehearsal or practice which is broken in into small bits over a long period of time rather than teaching a whole information of within a very short time That is what we are calling massing and when it is massed it may not have that meaning and students also get tired and they lose interest So it should be spread over a long period of time maybe hours maybe be several periods maybe over weeks maybe over months maybe over period of years depending on when that information will be required So that at the end of it it makes sense So those are the four basic principles of improving memory\nHaving said that then uh we have been talking about cognitive learning theories from where we started We talked about cognitive theories and the people who talked about them we came in and talked about information processing you know information processing as a way of learning and we came to memory in terms of remembering and forgetting So let us look at the application of cognitive learning principles application of cognitive learning principles So these are the now the implications for teaching and also for education One as a teacher concentrate on the fundamentals first concentrate on the fundamentals first We are saying now you you know depending on what you are teaching and we know in various subjects we are teaching there are lot of concepts to be taught so depending on what you are teaching and the new area of specialisation you look at the topic look at the fundamentals of whatever topic you want to teach what are the main concepts and you start with those ones you must point out for the students the main points which they have to remember That is the first thing Then having them that then you need now to go to the details and these information may have to be broken depending on how much it is So you have to spread it so that the learners learn bits by bits until they've mastered everything they master you know the first things fast and you others they continue so that they master the important concepts and principles Two get the students involved get the students involved We are saying now what we are saying in this one is let the students use discussions rather than broad memory Let them discuss find time for them to discuss issues let them debate about it rather than encourage them to actually getting <O/> in our memorising information because if they forget one thing they will not remember what for comes after that So rigid memorising should be discouraged but the discussion in most of that age that you teach for understanding Now point number three is make time for overlearning make time or have time for overlearning Make time or allow time for overlearning That is use repeated practice use a repeated practice review basic skills review basic skills", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'fd6159c1-a819-4e97-b708-9c1b5995222d', 'added':

{'text': "<$E> On second of August nineteen ninety Iraq invaded Kuwait and announced the merger of the two countries a few days later In our first instalment in two we examined the Gulf Crisis and looked at its historical as well as economic perspectives In this edition we'll look and examine whether solutions to the Gulf Crisis must come all the way from the United States and other European countries Aren't Arabs themselves capable of solving their own problems As well as that we'll discuss the impact of this crisis on the ordinary man in the street Taking part in this discussion as members of the panel are Chempondo Alec Humphrey Senior Lecturer Department of Political Science and Public Administration University of Dar es Salaam Karim Isaack Lawyer and Editor of Liberation and Ugandan Digest Robert Rweyemamu a columnist with Business Times and Felix Kaiza Editor of Property Digest Karim Isaack starts us off as to whether solutions to the Gulf Crisis must come all the way from the United States and other European countries\n<$B> Yes uh you know it is very interesting to note that when Iraq invaded Kuwait I think you know Iraq did hint to various people that look if this oilfield issue is settled and this question of the price of oil is settled and that we owe this ten billion debt is settled we would withdraw On the basis of that Arafat came out with a ten point plan which was supposed to have been discussed at the Arab summit in Cairo Now some forces came in and that was never discussed Instead you know the Arab League at this meeting condemned Iraq Now there has been a procedure all this time that you never pass any resolution unless there is a consensus For the first time they use the word majority minority to have in favour eight against and so forth Right Now this is against the Constitution of the Arab League In other words there were forces that were working to prevent the Arabs coming to a solution amongst themselves Even now too there is this plan there is the Arafat plan there is the Ghaddafi plan Arafat uh uh uh uh uh involves the replacement of uh uh uh Iraqi troops uh uh with UN troops or Arab League troops Ghaddafi has the same idea Namely that in the case of Kuwait UN troops occupy it and Arab League uh occupies the uh that the uh uh troops that occupied Dubai now by US may be removed and Arab League now takes over In other words this is now the Arab League solution promoted by certain Arab countries including the PLO But if you read the latest issues of Newsweek America has made it quite clear whether Saddam  Husseinwithdraws or stays in Kuwait they are staying put in the Gulf And today BBC announced that Baker has addressed the Congress Committee\n<$A> At the time I was in the United States of America myself and uh there had been this Middle East war uh uh the Arab countries had come together denying oil say to the United States of America because Israel had attacked there Now one thing which Henry Kissinger then uh uh State Department Director or Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United States under President Nixon had said something He said that uh these Arabs must release the oil with immediate effect otherwise we are coming to take it And that uh the excuse he made was that uh we cannot accept the economic strangulation from anybody So this probably means that the United States has had under its sleeves a concocted plan to be in the Middle East effectively and uh this Iraq-Kuwait situation provides the panacea for the American presence and since it has also been crowned with the dignity of United Nations resolutions to that effect then uh it's a dignified thing and they are there and if they say they are there to stay uh the United Nations has in a way supported them\n<$E> But uh what surprises me is why have the United why has the United States come out so strong uh against Iraq's invasion of Kuwait because there was this package that was from the United States and yet another from the United Nations Did this situation really warrant such harsh repercussions Felix\n<$D> Well I think uh the whole question is uh the question of oil That must be the point at issue because uh uh one uh should remember the uh Saudi Oil Minister saying uh we have become an integral part of the oil-market of the US and the return on our investment depends on the health of the market Now uh there can be no other explanation uh to the present crisis These people are looking for the oil They want to take care of their interest irrespective of whatever happens to the uh common man in the Arab world or in the other parts of the world I think what uh they are looking for is their economic interest derived from oil\n<$E> To me there seems to be lack of foresight on the part of the international community because if you remember in nineteen seventy-five seventy-five seventy-six seventy-eight uh we had this inflation that was caused by uh OPEC uh raising the prices of oil and uh the United States and all other Paris Club members thought time was right to begin looking for alternative sources of energy Now before we've come up with other sources of energy we've been caught up in another crisis and it looks like the oil is going to go up and the implications are going to be far and wide in fact as far as uh many other developing countries like Tanzania uh don't you think that there was this lack of foresight Maybe if we had uh been keen enough in those days to look for alternative sources of energy this crisis maybe wouldn't have meant so much for most of us Rweyemamu\n<$C> I agree with you There is a problem which we have to face uh but uh I don't know uh what uh poor people like ourselves can do about it We are bound to be victims of the circumstances and uh as it is uh uh I don't know what foresight could have helped because as far as our interests are concerned we have no alternative the uh we have no other source of oil and uh uh really we have to bear the consequences So really I cannot imagine what could be a way out *excepti> uh uh uh uh a forced rationing of oil and uh as the government has said a *stricty> uh uh uh care in the use of oil Actually the truth is as far as uh the main players are concerned in the uh uh affair they are not worried about the small people they are not worried about our interest they are worried about their own interest The big powers the including the United Nations Security Council they are not worried about our interests So really we have only uh uh our own uh fate to control nobody else can help us in this situation\n<$E> Yeah I'm trying to have a vision here uh as we enter the twenty-first century What kind of people are we going to enter in that century with AIDS in our midst Air fares are going to rise definitely We have this debt crisis to grapple with and then we have uh events in Eastern Europe which might rob us of the aid that we were used uh to getting from the Western countries or developed countries With this crisis going on and we don't even know when it's going to be over chances are we are going to be more in economic quagmires than anything else Karim\n<$B> Yes I think it is a challenge to man and woman not only in Tanzania but in all the areas where people are poor It is a challenge to conquer the forces of nature It is a challenge to conquer uh the problems of society Now take for instance Tanzania Now we have coal and we have got a burning coal and uh you know it requires of course a certain degree of investment in the coal but I'm quite sure that if it's set about seriously about it we could be able to develop our coal industry and then uh not completely destroy our impact on uh the oil prices but we'll be able to soften part of the impact And as far as the West is concerned and it's not so much what did you say lack of foresight but they realise look man if we are going to invest in atomic energy if we are going to be you know in nuclear energy that cost billions and billions Now why do that when we got uh you know uh uh uh uh Saudi Arabia giving us oil at eighteen dollars a barrel which is very cheap because if we invest so many billions in nuclear look what we get in returns It'll take years So that's one of the reasons why they chose the cheaper option although they went for the nuclear they haven't gone as much because they think in terms of cash So I'm quite sure just like I mean there are countries like you know or I talk about Eastern Europe or even Russia they were backward thirty years ago but because of the creativity because of political organisation because of the unity they were able to pull themselves up And I'm quite sure that with correct ideas correct political orientation we in Africa we in Tanzania also must and we will pull uh ourselves up from these problems All we require is really you know first we must have knowledge extensive knowledge of the world around us extensive knowledge of what is taking place uh in our own environment and once that is transmitted to people I'm quite sure the people are going to rise and uh solve these problems\n<$E> Mr Chemponda Alec\n<$A> Yes uh there is also another aspect I think of your question Edda Sanga and that is uh that as we uh head on toward the twenty-first century uh what is needed I think we need to set our priorities correctly uh because uh when you look at one other country uh which is Japan and uh I lived in Japan nineteen eighty four eighty five on my sabbatical leave from the University Dar es Salaam I saw a very interesting thing The Japanese do not have much of raw materials at all natural resources they don't have much of them at all uh and yet they have uh managed to come out to become a power to be reckoned with uh We need to look at the perspectives of what make Japan what made Japan and to see why can't we also make ourselves\n<$E> Maybe the difference between Japan and us is that they've got the technology which we don't have\n<$A> Yes that's why I said that uh what we need is the tactics you know to tackle things and to set the priorities properly\n<$E> Karim you want to come in\n<$B> Yes just come in to say that in 1930 in the thirties Japan also did not have the technology but the Japanese went they told the <slang/>Japs whenever you go to Britain don't go as tourists go and get as much information as possible about everything Every Japanese went there as a crusader to get knowledge\n<$A> And then they were told to come back home and when they came back home you know this is something which I noticed when they came back home they were actually placed properly that if you were an engineer you were given an engineering job if you were if you had this particular expertise you were given the proper possible place where your expertise was being utilised properly uh Once you begin to twist people that someone educated in a certain field you put him in another field altogether you confuse them it becomes a problem in their creative talents and therefore the the country becomes retarded a little bit because of misplacement of the native talents\n<$E> Rweyemamu\n<$C> Miss Chairperson this is where we have got to take very serious view of our problems Our problems are not insoluble they can be solved Dynamic action is required especially in the field of manpower especially in the field of uh talent promoting talented people to use their uh talents", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$F> Food for the Future But first we must know what is food Dr Bitanye\n<$A> I think many people would easily answer this question as anything that one eats in order to nourish his body But one question arises Do you always get nourishment from what we eat or do we always eat what is nourishing uh From this point of view I think we you all know that food uh can be divided into about four major groups There are those foods which give us energy and these include things like starch foods cassava maize uh wheat and the like And also foods like meat or fat meat which also gives you energy There are also some types of food that will give you protection from diseases and these foods include uh foods like uh fruits citrus fruits and the like and also green vegetables that are said to be good sources of uh vitamins There are other foods which as we all know are the basic building blocks of our bodies that is proteins These proteins are essentially the ones which make us grow and repair our bodies From this same point of view we have found that the world at large is having a surplus of food In fact the statistics that we have indicate that we have ten per cent more food than is required in by the population today But the problem is the distribution The distribution of food in the world even within the same country is not even As it has been pointed earlier in the discussion those people living in the rural areas are terribly undernourished And some of them are in the danger of dying from hunger From other statistics it is also indicative that generally uh the world consumes on the average uh food that gives them two hundred and thirty sorry two thousand three hundred calories per person per day of food that give them energy and uh up on the average about sixty-two grams of food that builds their bodies We in Tanzania are slightly above the average We have in fact uh two hundred two thousand eight hundred calories per person per day and sixty-five grams per person per day for protein This indicates that Tanzanians are generally above average in uh nutrition But of course generally the distribution of food is not even So one could find that people living in rural areas or in any other areas that are poorly supplied with food are terribly undernourished Some of them may be suffering from of hunger while in other parts of the country other people may be having too much to eat So here you have the problem of undernourishment and of overnourishment But this is the question that we will be discussed later when we come to look at the major constraints to food production and food uh availability I should probably end here and leave my colleagues to continue the discussion before I come in again\n<$F> Thank you very much Lothar Bitanye uh for warming up the panel and uh as I can see here uh the faces are shining and showing some sort of a they have some comments to give uh concerning this first question what is food Uh Mr Manento\n<$B> Yeah Thank you Mr Chairman as Dr Bitanye is clearly uh talking about the definition of food I'd rather to like to add that uh uh food is not only uh that one to fill the stomach but food should contain all essential ingredients in order that it uh may balance the uh the body requirements Therefore it's is important to note that food should be of should have nutritional balance uh as you can see that uh in some parts of the country you find people suffering from malnutrition while they're surrounded by abundant food uh materials Therefore it is important to uh note that food should uh be utilized at the level uh which allows the nutritional balance Mr Chairman\n<$F> Yeah Are there any comments uh concerning the first question before we move on to our second stage of the discussion uh Muheto\n<$C> Yeah I would like to agree with the Prof Bitanye's Dr Bitanye's definition of food and the elaboration made by my colleague Mr Maneto but I should like to add uh on the types of foods which uh conventionally they are not uh thought about whenever people think of sources of food Uh In the Tanzanian context I should like to remind uh Tanzanians that the various sources of food including include those which are available in the forests uh in the oceans and uh uh in the ocean you would have two types of foods There are animal foods and plant uh plant foods Uh I should like to expound on what is available in the forest There are plant foods like uh mushrooms uh roots leaves and even fruits uh and also when you look at what the forest contains there are many small animals which uh also would contribute much on the availability of food in Tanzania Uh we also have a whole a range of insects which uh are a good source of protein and when you go to the ocean environment you have all sorts of marine organisms the crabs uh <O/> uh oysters squids and what have you So I should like to expound on this definition of food so that many Tanzanians should not be limited by what is normally obtained on the farm but they should also extend their knowledge about the availability of food in the forests and uh oceans Thank you Mr Chairman\n<$F> Uh Mr Muheto you have touched on our second phase of the discussion but before I move on to that uh maybe someone has got a comment on this one Not at all okay So I'm just talking of one We're talking of food uh it means the opposite of which is hunger Now let us look how is hunger related to the quality of environment and uh Muheto you are conversant on this I think since you you're\n<$C> Uh Yes I am but I should like to get some comments from uh other discussants if they have something more detailed to tell\n<$F> Yeah Kajumula\n<$D> Yeah Thank you Mr Chairman Maybe a point which relates to this is the fact that everybody needs food from the definitions we have got and the common components of food but this food has to be produced or it has be tapped from different sources And the major source being the land It is the land which is now creating world-wide worries because of the way it is management managed in producing food I think this is a very important area which has caused concern to every government to see if it's possible to sustain food production at the rate the land is being destroyed or at the rate the land is being misused\n<$F> Yes Now sometimes\n<$A> Yes Mr Chairman I would also like to chip in-\n<$F> Yes\n<$A> what my colleague has just said that uh really uh the main constraints that uh have uh confronted many developing countries in particular is the way we have been managing our environment uh Our expert will probably expand more on this but uh you'll find that uh whenever food production is considered the environment is not uh at the same time considered Some people would just clear the land plant whatever they can plant and then use as many chemicals as they wish to use uh things like herbicides or even insecticides even in fact fertilisers can be quite hazardous to the to the land that produces the food if we are not very careful Of course my colleague has talked about the land uh but of course the sea as well There is the problem of uh sea pollution which invariably of course uh uh destroys the marine life There's also the pollution of fresh water rivers and lakes which does the same thing today to the marine uh to the water uh life and the like Of course uh the of question of clearing the forest as well has something to do with it but as I said I'm not the expert on this I'm sure my colleague uh Mr Muheto uh will be able to give us more details\n<$F> Yeah the burden has fallen to Mr Muheto but before he chips in but uh Mr Mbonde\n<$E> Both my colleagues have been touching this element but perhaps I'll come back a little bit on the crucial question which uh which Mr Chairman you asked in which you said `what is hunger' Sometimes it is difficult because this is a psychological feeling or feeling which someone experiences due to not having adequate uh food within his body system but the crucial part perhaps which we should draw back and try to consider uh why this hunger comes about and uh I think as my colleagues have been touching about the pointed areas where uh the sources of food can be grown or can be obtained Now the crucial part here we're we are concerned which in one way or another contributes to this uh shortage of food and ultimately hunger is of course as it has been explained to be the problem of the environment This means that we are constraining the environment due to uh either overuse or improper use of the land to sustain various I mean various which I mean vegetative growth or any more I mean uh growth within that area and uh these constraints of course  are attributed due to various factors which some of them are deliberately and some of <-->some of themRRR are I mean uh undeliberately due to other constraints which we are having Since as it has been pointed out that uh in some of our countries there is uh I mean a shortage of food though in general terms there is a is aRRR ten per cent surplus but the distribution element has been one of the  problems Now this one in those areas where the food is not evenly distributed people try to find other means of trying to produce it and unfortunately because these areas are in the rural parts where development or technology mean facilities are not available to improve the agricultural or livestock husbandry they go into practices which does not sustain though in the >´short term they could get benefits from these areas but in the long term they are uh I mean affecting the land adversely to support any future for supplies Perhaps that is all I would comment for the time being\n<$F> Uh thank you very much <ea/>Ndugu Mbonde and I would like to quote uh a sentence from the World FAO Journal uh for the Food for the Future which says `Environment concerns came to the forefront of international attention at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in nineteen seventy-two which led to the establishment of the United Nations Environment Programme UNEP later the same year' FAO published its first preliminary backgrounds of the state of natural resources and the human environment for food and agriculture in nineteen seventy-seven So this shows actually uh how important environment is uh to the uh production of food uh Let's go back to Muheto\n<$C> Uh thank you Mr Chairman Uh before I dwell on this problem of uh uh environmental degradation I should like first to link it up with the problem of population As we know uh population is increasing uh in particular in many developing countries if not all uh In the case of Tanzania we all know that at the time of independence we were around nine million people but now we have increased up to around twenty-two point five million people and this is an increase which is still uh uh accommodated in the same area uh There are some issues which uh I would like to expound also related to environmental degradation particularly in urban areas We know that there is a quite a lot of urban rural urban migration and it is estimated by FAO that uh at the turn of the century about forty per cent of the rural population will be in urban areas So this calls for uh very careful planning of resource use both in rural areas and in urban areas Now before I go to the constraints which are environmentally oriented and which uh have a negative contribution to sustainable food production in our country in particularly I should like to dwell on the reason as to why people find themselves to say for example uh adopting bad methods of cultivation", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$A> Hello and welcome to the programme This week in this edition we revisit the University of Dar es Salaam where on twenty-fifth of August nineteen ninety the Prime Minister and First Vice-President <ea/>Ndugu Sinei Warioba held discussions with the University of Dar es Salaam Academic Staff Assembly\n<$B> My name is Alec Chemponda Political Science Mine is not a question but uh a sort of a proposal following your discussion recently with the uh ya WazaziRRR uh concerning what to do with the children who finish Standard seven In nineteen from nineteen seventy-six nineteen seventy-eight I was a field supervisor of a political science research uh on evaluation of Norwegian aided projects in Tanzania And during that time I was able to meet a lot of people around the country and one of the things they discussed was this gap between Standard seven and Form one and what to do with the children after they finish Standard seven and especially since most of them especially girls are still young for anything So parents were very much concerned and since you express this same concern I thought maybe I could bring this proposal which I was very shy of presenting before and I'm only presenting it today My suggestion is that we should start uh Standard eight with uh almost immediate effect or it should be started within two years from now This means that uh the Parliament will have to make a parliamentary act Act of Parliament ah which should uh make this particular change and the Ministry of Education should uh find uh the logistics and the the mechanics for bringing this about Now the introduction of Standard eight would operate like this in my opinion that uh those students uh who are not selected to go for Form one from Standard seven should be allowed to continue at the same school into Standard eight and in the year of standard eight they should be allowed to do the Standard seven exam with the next uh Standard sevens also And the selection to Form one should be taken from both Standard seven and Standard eight uh So those who are not selected from Standard seven will go into Standard eight for another chance the next year Those who are not of course selected after Standard eight they would still have an opportunity uh at least they would be mature enough this time to enter the world So that uh the parents won't be as fearful as uh they are now This is uh my proposal\n<$C> When I talked to Azazi I was not talking about uh Standard Seven leavers I was talking about the youth Whether they have completed Standard Seven or Form Four Form Six University we have a problem of employment for the youth So I was talking generally about employment of the youth Right up to now in the minds of many people they think once you are educated to any level you should go into formal employment whether it is in government and the parastatal sector in the private sector get formal employment I don't know how many we get every year out of primary schools secondary schools and uh uh institutions of higher learning But I know those who are employed in the formal sector in this country it's just a little over seven hundred thousand We are educating more children more of the youth every year than the seven hundred thousand So we have a very serious problem of unemployment and this mainly for uh the youth So I was talking of how we can generate employment for the youth as we should not just look into uh the formal sector We should pay more attention to the informal sector and provide the services that are required so that people can use their own initiative especially the youth in gainful employment That's what I was talking You are talking about education uh Well the acting principal secretary Minister of Education is here He might take it I think you can formally follow it up in uh that procedure I think it's an issue which has been discussed for some time now Why did we abandon the Standard Eight System the eight year uh primary school system Why did we did we go into uh the seven four two three or four five or whatever you have but I think that is as you say it is a proposal Don't expect to me to react\n<$A> Members of the University of Dar es Salaam Academic Staff Assembly were not coming out and the Prime Minister had to literally provoke them Then came this anonymous personality\n<$D> It seems to be the We don't seem to be in control Take this university for example If you leave out uh the foreign assistance we are getting uh essentially we can't afford the university without the foreign assistance uh Leaving that aside you go to the other side of uh the proper running of a university where you plan you budget And then you find that the resources which Government gives us cannot allow us to implement our plans And then we end up with this crisis situation and then when a crisis occurs somehow resources are available uh That's what worries me We in one way we can we seem not to be able to afford the university in another way we don't seem to want uh I mean as an uh as an institution of higher learning one would expect it to set an example of proper planning and proper implementation of these plans And we don't seem to be able to do that Now the environment somehow is not conducive to doing that That's what is worrying\n<$C> And I have heard the deduction of what you pay as rent which is a large amount as well It's the use of resources I think when we are in time of crisis sometimes we know how to use the available resources The vice-chancellor was telling me that the Council has decided that staff who are lodged in hotels with effect from next year next academic year \n<$?> almost immediately -\n<$C> immediately will be given sixty thousand shillings a month to find accommodation and that will serve I think you are using uh for some of them five hundred thousand shillings a month So instead of using a hundred and fifty-eight million to lodge people in hotels you might save more than a hundred million You haven't had more resources It's a reallocation of resources Well I don't think that is my really my problem I cannot sit and think if we think macro-micro There are macro-issues and micro-issues Now are we talking globally or specifically Because it is too general for me to react whether this rigidity is a national rigidity or you are saying it is the government The scarcity of resources that I don't dispute because it is the same argument I could hear from the Minister of Communications that we have so much of roadwork to do the money we are given is not enough Education is the same Health is the same Everywhere Now scarcity of resources is one We can talk of how to increase our resources The use of uh resources is another Now that's where we might come to rigidity Is it at the level of the University because some of the things that you are talking about are at the level of the University So are we talking about a general attitude of Tanzanians or are we talking of a Department or Government As I say if you I agree with you in times of crisis some money might be found Fire-fighting Fire-fighting is used It's a method everywhere but there are others where within the allocated resources maybe you might have your own rigidity So crises sometimes provoke you I'm sure if things were okay you wouldn't have searched like that But you have a crisis you try to solve the crisis So in this case I think what has transpired I think the extra resources as far as I know were eighty million because twenty million  were the resources of the University You have had a hundred million Twenty million came from the resources of the University The University was closed earlier you had said So you determined how to use the twenty million The eighty million came from the Government But apart from that you're in that crisis One of the items that was discovered say I think that a number of them whether you  talk about books you discovered that you are buying expensive books So you sit down you say why can't we buy cheaper books With the same resources we can get more books You are using a hundred and fifty-eight million for rent You say why can't we devise another system so that we can save and I'm sure what you are going to save from that rent money you can use it for other resources for other uh works in at the University So if it is a general criticism of rigidity in our minds or the system then we can all of us think about it uh Really I don't think you can because there are certain things we cannot interfere with you here And in any case the budget the framework comes from here You decide your priorities here in the context of the little resources we have You are the ones who determine And I'm sure even the vice-chancellor before the budget comes I think it comes from every faculty And every faculty will determine its own priorities knowing that the resources are not enough Now where is the rigidity I I'm not supposing that I'm trying to answer you You are provoking I'm trying to provoke you some more \n<$E> uh I'm Dr Muraga from the History Department I think the concept Mr Prime Minister the concept of having closed the University to save I think is wrong We haven't saved for closing the University I think we should get away from this\n<$C> No no no I didn't say that we closed the University in order to save that one consequence of closing the University was that you had some money and you wondered how to use that money and used it that way Now let me come to the point I think I don't know whether the vice-chancellor uh told you when I said if I come here I would like to have to uh to discuss a few things with you The general impression we have and I think I'm gaining it here uh I don't know what that It's some sort of apathy at the University We don't know whether it is a consequence of the closure of the University but the sort of uh literature that you have uh issued is worrying us Because whatever has happened when the University reopens you are the people who are going to return it to normality And I told the vice-chancellor reading through this you have a lot of concerns Now I thought I could come and discuss with you some of these concerns and that you'll be as frank as possible and discuss whatever worries you here This is your document isn't it Well it is a document of the General Assembly of UDASA You raise a number of concerns here As was willing and I told the vice-chancellor I was ready to spend three hours here so that we can discuss frankly because it worries us And I assume you discussed it in detail The President read this document He was worried He said I think we ought to have a fuller discussion with the members of the Academic Staff Clear out any misunderstandings any worries so that when the University opens we put the crisis behind and proceed As usual I'm the front man Sometimes it is easier that you can talk with me rather than the President Now this document has made a good background very good background to the crisis Has examined in detail the issues

{'text': "<$A> Well today we are discussing the International Village for Science and Technology here in Tanzania Maybe to begin with uh Dr Shayo can you tell us what this centre is all about\n<$B> uh This centre uh actually it's not a centre it is a village It's non-governmental uh non-profit-making international organisation uh whose objectives is to promote science and technology in Africa through the organisation and exploitation of uh indigenous scientific capacity The village will also develop young talents to the highest level possible\n<$A> And are there any uh special reasons as to why this village are there reasons as to why uh which necessitated the establishment of this particular village\n<$B> uh There uh Actually there are several reasons uh First the idea of creating the village arose out of uh desperate realisation that the traditional systems of education we inherited uh have not actually managed to uh to bring about uh uh the development of scientists and technologists in the region Now we have also been motivated uh through our participation at the uh International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste Italy which was created in nineteen sixty-four precisely to assist uh scientists from developing countries uh to uh develop themselves and prevent them from running away from their countries Now we have the experience which uh African scientists participating in the ICTP sponsored activities on several occasions and deliberating on the plight of African scientists and appreciated that the creation of centres of excellence such as the Village is the only answer to the problems facing the developing countries and African countries in particular In general therefore the global motivation behind the creation of the Village is the unquestionable conviction that the Village will revolutionise the harnessing of the enterprise of science and technology in Africa and this is indispensable if we are to achieve any measurable social-economic development Now the Village is designed to promote science and technology at all levels\n<$A> Dr Shayo has uh told us about the Village and why uh there was need to put up such a village here in Tanzania Maybe <name/> can you dwell on the objectives of the Village \n<$C> uh Briefly one can say that there are five objectives The first is to enable scientists and technologists to exploit their ingenuity fully by providing them with the means and the best environment for innovations and a place for thinking uh Two to promote uh inter-African and international co-operation in science and technology mainly because science really knows no boundaries Thirdly and this is particularly true in our situation in Africa today to provide special facilities for the training and development of talented scholars uh to the highest level possible  Fourth uh there is since science is so interrelated it is necessary to promote interdisciplinary research and development activities uh not only in an academic milieu but also in collaboration with industries Finally it is necessary to promote the teaching of science and technology at all levels uh and in particular so as to improve the quality of books laboratory equipment uh as well as to organise promotional activities and very related to this would be to have uh seminars for teachers and zonal students to resolve problems\n<$A> Dr Mvungi location of such a village in Tanzania uh Prof Msangi location of uh such a village uh in Tanzania is also uh very crucial Where do you intend to put up the Village \n<$D> uh The International Village for Science and Technology will eventually have its headquarters in Arusha But before the headquarters are built the International Village for Science and Technology will be temporarily based in Dar es Salaam At present uh the preparatory activities of the Village are based at the University of Dar es Salaam but there are also possibilities that when the new offices uh the new office block of the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology which is currently under construction gets completed towards the end of this year some of the activities of the International Village for Science and Technology might be based in that building\n<$A> Are there any specific reasons as to why you decided to uh choose Arusha as the location of the Village \n<$D> Oh yes uh The Provisional Council of the International Village for Science and Technology considered four possible locations for the headquarters of the International Village for Science and Technology on the basis of four well-defined criteria One criterion was the ease of access by international airlines that is to say uh the availability of uh of a good and modern airport with international connections Secondly there was need uh for the Centre to be located in a place with a mild and favourable climate for academic work and a climate which is not corrosive to sensitive scientific equipment that is to say a climate which is characterised by moderate temperatures and humidity levels throughout the year uh Thirdly the place should be attractive and should have a an attractive countryside with tourist attraction so as to serve as an inducement for foreign scientists And  fourth there should be availability of a reasonable amount of infrastructure uh in the way of international standard hotel accommodation conference facilities and a a reasonable amount of existing research facilities Now on the basis of those four criteria uh the four locations that were considered were Dodoma Morogoro Dar es Salaam and Arusha And on the basis of a point score Arusha obtained the highest score So it is intended that the International Village for Science and Technology shall be located or have its headquarters in Arusha\n<$A> Thank you Prof Msangi Dr Mvungi can you uh What benefits do you foresee uh as to What benefits will Tanzania get by hosting the International Village of Science and Technology \n<$E> uh It is very many you know Many benefits can be enumerated uh First of all one could consider the possibility of all the scientists in country you know those who have the calibre to interact within the International Village They will have easy access to the Village and they will not be compelled to make formal arrangements for travel you know which normally takes a lot of time if you have to leave your own country to go to an international place for such activities The second reason is that the spring-offs from the Village will spread much more easily to the scholars and to the industries in the country by promoting productivity and we also expect that through its international activities the Village will promote scientific revolution uh not only in science but also in the area of technology in Africa in general but we expect that Tanzania will benefit more from this kind of revolution And the international character of the Village is expected to guarantee high standards and therefore provide a model to our local institutions which can emulate by seeing what is happening at the International Village so that is also another benefit And another benefit is that scholars visiting the Village will be motivated to to do more to produce more serious work to become more productive because I think normally when you work with colleagues who have produced results you're also motivated to produce results and we expect the Village to have that kind of attraction to our scientists And on the other hand we also expect that Tanzania will become a centre of science and technology and it will be known as a centre of science and technology and that we consider to be an important advantage by hosting this International Village uh It will also open the country to international scientific community and therefore not only boost the tourist industry but also promote the outlook in the way we should best harness the enterprise of science and technology for social-economic development And lastly I think that uh Tanzania will benefit by having uh other people support the Village through its uh this the activities of the Village once they know what is happening in the Village we'll get more support from the international community but within the field of science and technology and possibly help the country to industrialise more\n<$A> Thank you very much Dr Mvungi for underlining the advantages of the uh Village to Tanzania Now if I may come back to you againProfessor Mascarenhas Are there any plans for self-reliance in the operational plans of the Village \n<$C> Yes I would like to emphasise that uh the whole project has started by being self-reliant to the extent that the initiatives are coming from Tanzania itself Now in the future uh we will have to prevail upon this very good start which we made uh Let me say that in initial stages the Village will depend entirely on uh local uh as well as international donations uh However with the functions which you have already mentioned and those which are envisaged such a village cannot exist uh on its own especially in a poor developing country like Tanzania in fact if its goal is not eventually self-reliant but it is an international village and therefore we are not only talking about Tanzania uh I think we would like to emphasise the self-reliance will also be with other African countries With this uh realisation therefore the Village will adopt a policy which emphasises uh as we have already stated self-reliance right from the start Most institutions when they're young have to rely on sources outside for assistance also but I think in this particular case the percentage of the budget of uh the Village uh will increase from year to year until in fact the total amount coming to self-reliance activities will be an appreciable part of the total budget of the Village\n<$A> Dr Shayo Maybe now we could uh go a little bit into the role of the Village in the promotion of education uh How will this particular Village *upbring> for instance primary education secondary education university education and indeed research in Tanzania \n<$B> Well uh very generally the Village will promote primary secondary and university education uh by making its facilities available to scholars from these institutions uh It will promote research by offering hospitality to researchers Now to be more particular there will be an international uh primary school complex and an international secondary school complex at the Village specifically for talented scholars Now these schools will have the best available facilities or may let me say that the uh we shall try to have the best available facilities for the training and development of such talents Now special visits by selected groups of these uh to these complexes will promote excellence in descending institutions Now the Village will also promote joint activities between primary schools and secondary schools on the one hand and between schools colleges and university teachers on the other hand in order to create required skills uh As an example uh one could uh you could envisage uh a joint activity uh in book-writing For example if you one is to produce a book for secondary schools one could do uh use secondary school teachers and university teachers uh uh writing chapters jointly Now the Village will accommodate international research centres for each of the science disciplines that is Biological Sciences Biotechnology Chemical Sciences <O/> Sciences Mathematical Sciences uh Physics uh Technology and also a centre for uh the design and fabrication of science teaching and research  equipment Now scientists from all African countries and also from all over the world uh will be able to conduct research and interact in various academic uh activities which will be organised at the Village Now the of great importance is the Technology Centre which will form a link with industry It will have a variety of components for visiting innovative technologists who would like to maybe fabricate whatever uh gadgets they may have designed Moreover talented scholars will attend their uh undergraduate and postgraduate studies in the centres in the research centres with assistance of senior scientists visiting the Village Now what we are saying here is that the Village will have a will offer university education but not in the conventional sense uh of having a university campus and so on uh That is uh this the undergraduates and postgraduates will join the respective uh research centres where uh scientists from all over the world will be there to assist them uh Special organised visits by selected undergraduate and research groups as well as industrialists will promote excellence in descending institutions For example a person working in an innovative person working in an industry could for example spend three months at the science village uh to complete uh work which could not have completed in the place of work and after that go back to the industry", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'bc49c040-da12-48bb-92cc-86e148b3c73d',

{'text': "<$A> The important questions that were addressed in the paper are basically three which I think will be the focus of our discussion this afternoon The first question is whether women are able to participate in the productive processes and the welfare benefits in the course of economic development The second question is whether women are primary victims of exploitation And the third is what factors influence alternative outcomes with regard to women's participation The fourth question which we will be addressing ourselves to will be to what extent are women aware of technical and financial support from donor agencies as well as loan schemes operated by different banks and other organizations in the country\nNow maybe we should start with the first question which is to what extent can women participate in the productive processes and the welfare benefits in the course of economic development uh Rose\n<$B> Uh thank you the question is not whether women can participate I think it is a well-known fact that women do participate Statistics show that uh production in this country whether it's food crop or whatever it's the women who participate Over seventy-five per cent of the food production is being carried out by women in this country What is lacking here is that women have not been enabled to participate fully in development There are constraints that make women's contribution uh hampered That is uh work heavy load that they have then lack of technologies that will reduce the work load and uh the lack of access to facilities that are being provided by the nation or the donors or whoever is providing the facilities And the other important thing is lack of effective participation in decision-making in the decision-making processes because I want to distinguish here between being represented and participating in decision making\n<$A> Any more comments\n<$C> Well I think Rose is quite correct in the answer she gave for your question Women are really participating and very much in agriculture But uh the point she raised about their participation in decision-making I think it is the cornerstone of the problem we are having right now that uh in spite of the fact that women do participate but they could do better if they would first be in the decision-making bodies right from the villages and up Therefore maybe we should not uh dwell in this since the policies of this country favour the development of women maybe now in the execution of it we should see to it that women are involved in the decision-making to affairs which can make them more able to participate in their development\n<$A> <ea/>Mama Busongo do you have any comments about this\n<$D> Well there  is a lot to be desired when you are talking about women in this country Your question was are women able to participate in the production productive processes and the welfare benefits in the course of economic development Participation of the woman as uh Rose has said you can't deny or there's no limit where a woman is not participating in development of this country But there are a lot of things which make this woman not participate fully in her capacity Uh I think one of the  factors which is very important for a woman is the health service which a woman is getting in our dispensaries which we are having in our country Rose has said that in the uh in the production we've got this seventy-five per cent of all the women participating in the economic development But when you go to the records health reports you find that twenty per cent of these women most of the time are pregnant Another twenty per cent of these women are having children under five years Now we all know how effective is a woman in production when she is pregnant And we all know how busy is a woman when  she's having a child under five years And when we go to our dispensaries we find that we have got I mean the medicines drugs which we're having are not sufficient enough to make this woman be treated when she is in need of treatment or when she brings her child to the dispensary You find that there is not enough medicine or treatment for this child As a result this woman is restless is busy with childcare is busy with her health as a pregnant woman So when you add these twenty per cent of pregnant women and another twenty per cent of uh  mothers having a child under five year five years you find that forty per cent uh out of seventy-five per cent these women are in health problem So if we want to make these women to participate fully in our production economic development it's very important for our plans to make sure that health department is very well equipped we have got these medicines in our dispensaries and in our hospitals so that we enable this woman to participate fully in economic development This is my opinion\n<$A> I thank you One of the issues as we discuss the role of the woman in the economic development is normally uh based on the woman as a health provider the woman as a food provider and the woman as the maker of the home in general And some of the issues that are normally discussed in these particular lines of arguments do centre particularly on key issues that are important in maintaining the family that are important in the general up-keep of the family Uh in the area of health obviously it is important as Honourable Busonga uh said that the health of the woman of women in general is an important issue it's an important factor in the general up-keep of these very individuals Uh what do you think should then be done in improving facilities in the health sector Mary Ruila \n<$C> First of all maybe I should start by saying uh that presently the government has done a lot to that since uh besides having the health services right there in the towns or in the city it has been possible to have even dispensaries or health services in the villages If I give an example of my district here nearly all the fourteen villages have got dispensaries And they have they are running their MCH clinics for the mothers Now maybe to build up to that what I think could be done in order to improve the health services for the women is to carry out health education classes I think this is very fundamental I really think it is still is stillRRR lacking I know it is done in the hospitals I mean when you go there before you are attended then there will be a class going but I don't think it is enough One that person is sick therefore when one gets there maybe with a baby and if she's sick I don't think it is the proper time I don't think she can grasp the matter from there But there should be deliberate classes or training health training programmes for the women in order to know some basic health issues And I think this would alleviate this problem of uh diseases and health care for this home maker\n<$A> Any comments Mrs Rugembe\n<$B> Uh I agree with <ea/>Mama Ruila that prevention is better than cure We all are aware that these there aren't enough sufficient funds to equip the hospitals with the required medicine so the approach of prevention should be stressed and then in that way you reduce I guess the number of diseases or you reduce the chances of people getting sick And uh there will only be need to go to the hospital when you know health care prevention care hasn't succeeded instead of besides going to the curative centres And uh when you have a healthy home when you have a healthy mother I believe you are definitely going to have a healthy home because a healthy mother will be able to participate fully in other activities that will benefit the family Maybe that I leave to your second observation I think it was are women aware of \n<$A> Yeah that's right The extent to which women are aware of technical and financial support uh available in the country uh Apart from health the other key sector which was addressed was really the agricultural sector Now the issue here is really the need to expand women's access to agricultural research and extension services perhaps by training key females who should be able to take up key positions in that particular area and in order to improve uh the women's participation in that particular sector Uh how do you think this should actually be done uh <name/> Busongo\n<$D> Well if we want to improve in agriculture there is a lot to be desired on how a woman should participate fully in knowing what to do so that she can improve the production of\n<$A> food\n<$D> Well it's food it's uh anything which she is growing in her in her farm should be done properly according to the what the agriculture experts are trying to explain to us But what I think is lacking is how we are trying to make these ladies participate fully when we want to make them reach the knowledge of how to use their talents and knowledge of agriculture so that when he farms when she farms she  gets more production per acre uh before comparing to what she was doing before Now we need a lot of seminars on how to use uh fertilisers how to plant using uh spacing according to the knowledge of these agricultural people So what I think we need a lot of seminars in our demonstration farms There is a is aRRR need of having small farms projects  in the village so that these ladies can see how much they can grow they can get from a little space This is what I think this could be done\n<$A> All right yeah to what extent do you think demonstration farms would be important uh <name/> Rugembe\n<$B> Uh in the old days I used to hear and see demonstration farms but my approach would be using the farmers' farms And the farmers' farms should become the demonstration farms So in order to do this first you need to increase the intake of female and of course male agricultural extension officers in schools so that you have more that can reach the farmers and farmers meaning men and women And then when you have these extension officers you could use the extension officers to go to make farm visits in their farms so that you know the demonstrations are done in their own farms When this is not possible then it's to use the existing facilities like the rural training centres the <O/> development colleges and uh all the other institutions that we have Then you can call the farmers and I insist farmers meaning women because they're the ones who are farming to these institutions where uh other facilities are available and teach them how to use uh whether it is fertilisers or irrigation pumps or whatever you have That is the only way that you can increase the knowledge of the women farmers and men farmers so that they can be more productive in the farms This business of calling seminars for male farmers will not take us very far because when they go back these guys don't go back to the farms and farm They explain to the women oh I went to that seminar and I was taught this and this So it is important that the services and the education should reach the one who is farming\n<$A> So you think training females would actually be much more important than the traditional methods where males have been trained and they go back to the villages as uh uh field assistants and so on\n<$B> Male training the females is very important and training the female farmers themselves because it is easier I believe for a female extension officer to communicate with a female farmer \n<$A> <name/> Rulia\n<$C> I would only like uh to assure this audience one thing The question of training women and not in the <O/> governmental colleges but right in the farms We have this in Kibaha", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '23e10ec2-e5a3-430f-933b-95413ad6b7ec', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.035049+00:00',

{'text': "<$A> Who would like to take the first plunge may be to give us the definition of culture Who'd like to define culture Okay uh Emilian \n<$B> Okay thank you uh culture is a wide term and it has been defined in uh very many ways and uh we can say that culture means the totality of life of a particular society Culture is a totality of life of a particular society including political social and economic affairs of that particular society Cultural things can be exemplified by ways of dressing ways of cooking ways of handling marriage affairs etcetera etcetera\n<$A> Thank you very much Does anybody want to add in some more Uh Omari \n<$C> Well I think uh in general we can say it's a Culture is the traditional norms and beliefs of a certain society which uh includes the as my colleague here has said dressing the people behave the way the people behave in that society\n<$A> Okay and uh gender Cuthbert you want to try this \n<$D> Well first of all gender is not the same as sex because we have two things gender and sex So gender is  culturally defined which  differentiates between females and male their activities and the things of that nature but sex is  biologically uh recognizable So when we talk about gender we have to put more emphasis on culture\n<$A> Okay would we be right in saying that uh gender is the relationship between males and females perhaps Datus \n<SE> To some extent you might be right to say so But when we talk of gender the insistence is on culturally constructed differences between males and females That's where the insistence comes in\n<$A> Okay So the next thing that we are supposed to define here in our context is change What do we mean by change here Cuthbert \n<$D> Change in a simple form we can say is just uh transformation That means transform to transform from one stage to another or from a certain situation to another That is change\n<$A> Okay Omari You want to add on\n<$C> Well uh well I think uh we can say change is uh moving from one position to  the next or from a certain kind of uh way of uh living to another simply we can say even moving from traditional to maybe modern status\n<$A> Okay maybe from backwardness to profuse\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> and things like that I see uh Datus is raising a hand What do you want to say \n<$E> Yes In fact when we are talking about the definition of change in fact it is a broad term If we talk of changing from backward to forward of course that's part of change but in fact we may look the word change even in normal terms Sometimes a person may move from one place to another that's change May change A person may change a way of life That's change already Now if we relate the question of change in the whole process of culture gender and related with change we are I think we are much referring to change from one way of living to another way in the sense that the previous the previous level was to some extent at the lower level of living now to we are moving to the better way of living That's why we are referring to change in relation to culture gender and change itself\n<$A> Okay I think this far we have uh managed to give a *perspection> or perspective to our listeners as to what uh we perceive to be uh culture gender and change Now we are on we are moving on with our discussion Who would like to take the first plunge whether we should look at these aspects differently or we should uh address these aspects you know in totality When we are addressing culture gender and change should we identify or discuss these in separation or should we take them as an entity one entity Uh Omari \n<$C> Well I think uh we will discuss this in its totality with the aim especially of Our aim is to discuss what at least from a male's perspective what could be done to enhance uh the women's position uh in relation to uh what men can do men and women together and women as well So this will take the issue uh discussion as a totality\n<$A> Okay So before we even address ourselves to what perhaps should be done maybe it would be better to look at the present situation How is the situation of culture gender and change in present day uh Tanzania Cuthbert \n<$D> I think the present situation as far as culture gender and change is concerned we can say that women are very much concerned uh at that time women are trying to emancipate themselves because for a long time it has been said that women are suppressed uh and this is due to the cultural situation So all in all in the present situation we can say that woman uh women are still uh suppressed and now they have to find some ways of change and these changes must go hand in hand with men so both genders must participate together in order to create changes and uh these changes must start from the grassroot or we can say from the family level up to the national level That is all I can say\n<$A> Okay thank you Cuthbert I liked the way you put it but uh I would like would likeRRR you to be more personal because you are saying it is said women are oppressed What do you say What do you say as a male \n<$D> Okay as a male and as far as my culture is concerned I can also say that women to some extent are oppressed since they are denied of their right\n<$A> Okay thank you very much Datus\n<$E> Yes in fact maybe responding to the first part of your question culture gender and change whether to treat them in a holistic manner or to differentiate them my comment is that we cannot differentiate the three because they are intertwined Now with reference to Tanzania we have seen that the culture is the way of living and gender is embedded within culture That's why we cannot talk of gender uh in a universal way Now when we are looking at this country of ours Tanzania we look at our country it has its own culture though again this is debatable whether we have got our own culture or what but uh I think that's not uh part of uh the debate now Now gender of our country is that in fact the difference between men and females or uh let's say females and males is there and it is both I mean it is actually socially constructed Now at this time women are not inherently treated as they are supposed to be and in fact the difference comes in when we look at uh we look atRRR the way culture treats women and the way this culture treats men because if you look at the whole process of gender it is socially constructed Now at this particular moment we are looking for change and change is inevitable at this particular time But again if before we look at change I think the most emphasis the most important point to insist on is change from where to where Where are we now and why are we looking for change I think that's where we must put the more emphasis\n<$A> Okay thank you very much From you I got two points that uh uh the whole question of women's oppression and suppression is socially constructed and it is embedded in culture\nOkay Emilian Let's hear from you You've been quiet for quite some time\n<$B> Yes I'm also of the opinion that these three things culture gender and change should be discussed uh together because they depend on one another because gender as the relationship between men and the women depends on the culture of a particular society That's why we can see that uh gender relations are different perhaps in the African traditions compared to Western or European American traditions That's why I say that culture gender and change should be looked upon together and not in single entities Of course according to me at the particular moment uh our culture as Tanzanians culture asRRR uh yes culture as TanzaniansRRR has been brought up by history uh to the extent that women are enjoying an inferior position compared to men whether you look at uh in several sectors of the economy or aspects of life that women uh uh occupy an inferior position compared to men and uh at this particular juncture when our country is undergoing social political and economic transformations uh when we are about to undergo change it is appropriate now to address ourselves to realizing and addressing uh those patches where gender imbalances occur that's gender imbalances  occur because in when a society changes a society changesRRR a change should involve all parts of this society because a change should be total and not partial because partial change would lead the society into an unpredicted situation which can be bad or harmful to that particular society\n<$A> So now as we enter into multiparty politics how do you view you know the position of women you know looking at culture historically and at present time looking also at uh the gender imbalances that uh Emilian just talked about and also uh looked at from the point of view that uh for a long time women were not there when uh politics were being discussed Omari \n<$C> Uh thank you Well in this uh multi-partyism era we could say that uh up to this moment the women are many of these parties are not really well explicit of  women's position but uh on my view is that I think uh at least there should be these parties should at least integrate the women's position in their whole system of leadership What I mean here is that in the past even the CCM now I think should think of a way of uh not keeping women as a women's wing which is the trunk there we can't really define because if this is a political party then all the people should be the whole trunk and no wings I think So what I see now is that also these new parties are taking almost the same stance uh having women's wing uh I don't know which is the trunk but I think the whole party all members are the trunk of the party So my feeling is that uh women's position may be put into a much better situation if uh they are not taken as a separate entity but uh people who uh have the right to be there in the centre and they can contest for any position available\n<$A> Okay considering the many uh disadvantages that women have in society due to cultural norms due to gender imbalances and due to the change that has actually been imposed on us It is not the kind of change that we wanted in the first place how do you see women being integrated into this change Who wants to Okay Datus \n<$E> Yes maybe to respond in a very viable way let's go back a bit to history There is the question of political culture in the whole process of democracy or uh of course we talk on this as democracy and part of multi-partyism Now there is a political culture of this country which existed even before independence and now it is repeating itself in the multi-party politics or multi-party era now If you visit our history in the pre-independence period when this country was fighting for its independence women were involved though not in a way that everyone of us could have reasonably now stated openly that they were involved The political culture I am referring to is that of using women to mobilize party membership and again using few women and placing them in the high profile or in the high political profile only to carry the party organs and make them be and then make them believe and in fact to confuse those who are below the profile that women are incorporated in the whole process of politics We saw before independence we have the story of Titi and the other one who was the first uh CCM the first TANU

{'text': "<$A> Thank you <name/> On my side I think it it's better to say environmental management rather than environmental conservation because when you conserve something it means you are not using it but in the case of environmental issues we are using the environment at the same time trying to preserve it from destruction so I would rather say environmental management and not only management sustainable management of the environment Okay when we talk of environmental management we are talking of preserving the environment from destruction preserving the resources from depletion and from pollution of the same resources for example distinction of endangered flora and fauna When we talk of flora and fauna we mean plants and animals There are several species of animals For example we have the black rhino which is about to be depleted in our country So trying to preserve the black rhino is one of the issues in environmental management Likewise maintaining the air quality Maintaining the air from pollution When we have clean air that's when we talk of environmental management of our air and also when we have clean water unpolluted water In certain cases we talk of Zigi river Karanga river the rivers which are polluted by wastes from industry So in fact environmental management essentially means preserving our resources namely land water and air from destruction and at the same time using the resources effectively \n<$B> Thank you Mrs Maembe for your contribution and thank you for giving us the right word that is not environmental conservation but it's not but it's environmental management that is because we are not experts at all So now we know that uh environmental management is preserving the environment from destruction depletion etcetera uh Mr Tenende do you have anything to say on what really do we mean when we talk about environmental conservation or I mean environmental management\n<$C> Well I think I agree with uh Mrs Maembe because when we manage I mean using the land in a manner which would ensure that uh the resources are there uh in the future to enable sustainable life to continue\n<$B> uh Erin Jiko do you have anything to add apart from \n<$D> Yes Having agreed having agreeing with  having agreed>-/> with them I still have wish to add that environmental conservation particularly in agriculture the way I see it is conservation of natural resources as they have said but I would like to include the conservation of human resources in this case particularly the woman herself It is not enough to just talk about uh natural resources like land and water then we should talk about the human resource in that case then we would touch the issues concerning her health and energy depletion when performing her tasks \n<$B> Now we understand uh uh when we talk uh about environmental conservation or environmental management we mean preserving natural resources and human resources Now how do you do we view the state of environmental problems in our country Mr Tenyende\n<$C> Well of course there are a lot of examples showing the destruction of environment uh For example there are statistics which show that uh uh the forest land which was there in nineteen twenty has been destroyed to the extent that only forty per cent remains and uh we are told that uh deforestation is continuing at a rate of zero point five per cent per year and this is something to be concerned  about because the impact is quite great both on land and climate and therefore there are examples of destruction of our environment in this country\n<$B> Mrs Maembe\n<$A> The state of environmental problems in this country range from environmental degradation and when we talk on of environmental degradation we  really mean soil erosion deforestation depletion of woodlands or pollution of our land for example those gold miners in <name/> These people are using mercury in the extraction of gold At the same time that this mercury is finding its way  into the streams and polluting the waters which are used for domestic use and other <.>por purposes Likewise we have depletion of our <ea/>nyumbo lands Of course in Tanzania we know that we have very big parts covered by <ea/>nyumbo woodlands and these parts are  really being utilised for making charcoal for cutting poles to build the houses and so on As a result a lot of areas have been depleted of their trees Likewise we have bush fires which are so rampant in our country especially during this dry season So these are just some of environmental problems in our country Just to to add to that we have also these farmers who are clearing a lot of woodlands for agriculture and in fact we sometimes put a pointing finger to agricultural people that these are the culprits of our environmental destruction because we think they go with one package of agriculture rather than sustainable agriculture for conserving our whatever resources are there Rather than cutting trees we think it would have been advisable for them to try to talk of agro-forestry rather than agriculture alone\n<$B> We have heard from Mrs Maembe that the state of environmental problems in our country is mainly caused by bush fires uh soil erosion etcetera Erin <name/> Jiko you are from the ministry of agriculture you might have something more to tell us what is the state of the environmental problems in our country\n<$D> Well concerning the woman in agriculture I see her environment you know in relation to the health problems that she's encountering You know the undesirable consequences such as backaches headaches you know lethargy and general malaise that is obtained from you know walking long distances you know trekking distances to look for firewood to look for uh uh fodder for their animals to look for uh to fetch farm produce to and from the farms and to look for fertile land as a result of environmental destruction that Mrs Maembe talked about So really that's how I view the environmental uh problem in our country as relation to the woman herself\n<$B> uh According to what you talked about he it seems that the state of environmental problems in our country is threatening because still women have to walk long distances to fetch water to look for firewood or to look for fertile land So uh can we ask ourselves why is it so Is there any reason that contributed to this state Mrs Maembe\n<$A> There are a lot of factors which have contributed to environmental problems in our country I would rather say the first thing that environmental awareness in our country is very low Sometimes people are doing things unknowingly For example in cases whereby you have people cutting a lot of uh trees for charcoal making sometimes they know that they uh are destroying the environment but circumstances force them to do so because of social economic problems and in certain cases you have no alternative sources of energy so you will be resolved to go to cutting trees rather than starve yourself So one of the factors is that of social economic status of the country It's contributing a lot to our environmental problems and two in certain cases for example in catchment areas in catchment forests people just go there and cut their trees  unknowingly><+_not knowing> that those are the sources of rivers those are the sources of water and after some time you find that the rivers the water streams dry up because of destruction of catchment areas though those are just a few cases whereby you have people unknowingly destroy their own environment and another issue again is that we have sometimes inappropriate agricultural practices People are farming in the marginal lands and on the hill slopes sometimes not practising environmental conservation or environmental management terracing of the hills making water furrows and so on Those two also contribute very much to environmental problems in our country\n<$B> The main reason that contributed to this state of environmental problems in our country which has been said by Mrs Maembe is the economic status of the country Any Mr Tenyende do you agree that population growth can uh increase can be one of the  reasons that contributed to this state \n<$C> Yeah exactly because uh the destruction the degradation of environment is due to human activity Now this the output outcome of the human activity depends on two things uh technological practices and the quantity of activity and uh population comes in because as population increases even human activity increases More and more people for example our country depends on agriculture Now when the population increases it means more and more land is put under agriculture As Mrs Maembe has mentioned because of population increase the good fertile land is scarce that the additional population moves into marginal land and given the level of technology we have the outcome is soil erosion uh and other degradations of the land and therefore population is quite key because even the system of farming changes When there was small population in the country uh shifting cultivation was very useful because you cultivate this plot this year and you leave it to recover and you're coming back when it is also again fertile Today it's not possible any more because of the concentration of people due to population growth \n<$B> So Mr Tenyende you really agree that population growth uh  increases the state of environmental problems in our country and Erin <name/> Jiko what do you say about it\n<$D> Well on the better methods of farming uh like the advocating of the use of chemical fertilisers there I see uh another problem emerging really in trying to solve uh the problem of conserving the land of fertilising the soil I'm still on the conservation of the human resources actually or when they apply chemical fertilisers and pesticides and all other agrochemicals most of the farmers and uh including women they do not have uh protective clothing The issue of protective clothing or protective gear you know things like gloves and gum boots so these ones really have got a lot of uh uh negative health impact I look at it is as a very big uh contributing factor to environmental degradation particularly in their health We advocate in our training sessions that okay gloves should be used and whatnot but then the limitation comes to the availability of these uh protective gear I rarely see rarely seeRRR so sometimes when we are trying to conserve in the environment when trying to we're trying to conserve the natural resources and then on the other hand we destroy the human resources so the application of chemical fertilisers is one of the contributions to the detriment of environment\n<$B> uh We have got different opinions on to why uh the state of environment problems in our country is threatening And uh we found that the awareness is very low so people don't know the alternative sources of energy to use uh We heard that when population increases the human activity is increasing and so more land is used And uh in that case the fertile land is not enough for all people to uh take part in it And uh Erin <name/> Jiko has reminded us something about protective clothing when using agrochemicals All these are factors that contribute to environmental problems in our country But on the other hand women have the a big role to play in conserving this environment What measures women take in conserving the environment in Tanzania Mr Tenyende\n<$C> Well it is sometimes  difficulty><+-diffivult> to outline exactly what women take to conserve uh environment because they are working or their activities are within the social context uh where they are not working alone uh One of the main  areas which I think is appropriate for women to take is first of all to move themselves from the social status they have today where they don't have uh the freedom to make decisions It appears most of the crucial critical uh decisions in relation to the use of resources is undertaken by men and therefore either way I feel it is that women have very limited  opportunities uh to undertake conservation uh uh natural resource conservation because of their status in the social the socialRRR field \n<$B> Yes women have uh limited opportunity to conserve the environment in Tanzania but they have their measures uh in which they take part in conserving the environment and that's what we want to know", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$X> Meeting of the Minds Hello and welcome to our discussion programme known as Meeting of the Minds Population is a sensitive issue which is now a major topic of discussion in various international fora because of the rapid population growth especially in developing countries In this first instalment in Two we'll look at among other things the implication of population increase  for the development process Taking part in this discussion are Dr Flavian Magari National Programme Officer United Nations Population Fund Mrs Christine Nsekella Executive Director of Tanzania Family Planning Commission and Mr Ulinyelusura Tenyende Assistant Director Human Resource Planning Leonard Mtawa is the moderator The programme sets the scene with Dr Flavian Magari \n<$B> Our population according to the nineteen eighty-eight census is about twenty-three million and uh the growth rate is put at around two point eight per cent With this growth uh our population is expected to double uh in the next twenty-five years That means our population will be over forty-five million uh in the next within uh our lifetime \n<$A> For a layman when you mention something like population problem please can you explain it in a language whereby somebody can understand What do you mean by population problem\n<$B> Well what we mean by population problem can be explained in the in various contexts We can look at the population problem from the point of view of our economy our social services We can look at the uh the problem of population from the point of view of environment and also from the point of view of the health of the mothers and the family in general So these are the major areas uh of the population problem I think which we should discuss in our discussion today \n<$A> Since the question of economy has been raised as uh one of the major contributing  factor><+-factors> to the uh magnitude of population problem now Mr Ulinyselusura Tenyende what do you have to say on that area\n<$C> uh Mr Moderator I would firstly say that here we are talking of population by which we mean the number of people in a country and uh that is this number which makes up the nation of that country and uh it is the concern of that < />co uh of that nation that this population enjoys a certain type of life and therefore it is the government's task and it has been a task to find ways of raising the standard of living of Tanzanians who make the population of Tanzania and give them the capacity to further develop themselves uh Now it becomes a problem in today's world mainly for two reasons First we are looking in the future we are looking at the rate of growth of the population From the nineteen eighty-eight census we saw that the intercensal growth rate that is the rate from nineteen seventy-eight to nineteen eighty-eight was two point eight per cent and that by historical standards and by world standards is a very big rate of growth As Dr Magari was saying it is this rate of growth which makes the population to double in a very short time Secondly is the fact that we relate this population growth and economic performance because we  want this population to be composed of well uh well-fed individuals Now we look that if the economy is growing at this rate and that population is growing at this rate you can see whether the economy can sustain you see the population which is growing like this Now given the short period of independence and particularly the crisis we have had since nineteen eighty statistics  show that if the economy is not going to increase to grow given this rate of growth of the population of course it indicates problem\n<$A> <ea/>Mama Christine Nsekella it's now your turn and since you are from the Tanzania Family Planning Association you are dealing with the planning of uh planning ofRRR the family Maybe uh you have something to tell us why uh I mean the nature of the problem how it appears that we have population problem\n<$D> Well it appears that we have uh family or population problems is that maybe over the years quite a number of people have not been conscious of planning their own families uh compared to the resources that they have within their home first of all uh which adds up to a problem  for the < />nat nation As a nation uh one really depends on how < />m how many people increase in a family in a given number of years So the nation tends to gain more people if uh the individual families are not planned uh This is why the Family Planning Association has been engaged in educating the people the Tanzanians on why it is important for them to plan their families and how they can plan because we think it is a human right for each Tanzanian to be able first of all to know why it is important to plan their families and how to plan And for those who have reached the age of uh bearing children to be able to get the services so that they can be able to plan their own families It is important because if you look at the family of today uh the family that requires all the necessary amenities in the home uh with that I mean proper clothing proper shelter uh proper education and proper love motherly and fatherly love The love that is needed for each individual child uh I think it is important that Tanzanians should be able to know all this and to relate their uh ability to take care of their children as well as to see the resources that are made available to each member of the family It can be a problem as Mr uh Tenyende has just pointed that if numbers are not planned according to the social economic development of the country then at individual level as well as at national level our population is uh going to be continuously under-developed and therefore will have to suffer in many ways both socially and economically\n<$A> As to what extent is the public is I mean the public awareness is on the population problems and the issues of family planning\n<$D> Well currently I would say that uh we think we have managed to reach to quite a large portion of the population but that is that is not enough because there is always some new peoples there's always some people that need more information and need articulated information and services at the same time We think uh quite a number of people are aware of why it is important for them to plan their families and how dangerous unplanned population can be to a nation uh but this kind of awareness has to be related to the provisions of the services that are available in the country because it's no good just educating people making them aware without matching the information with the services that are aware are available uh for them to use in the country and this is where uh the service provision comes in by uh private sector by the government particularly and by the uh association itself uh The services are there but probably we need to intensify more and that is not the only intervention to help the population problem issue There are many more others \n<$A> Dr Flavian Magari hopefully after discussing uh briefly on the problem of population in our situation uh our listeners are at least aware of how the situation is Now what is currently done to uh whether to control or to overcome such a situation\n<$B> Well thank you very much Mr Mtawa I think I would like to take a point of the problems a little further problems associated with the rapid population growth I think there are two major areas which we have to bring to light One of them is the environment uh Our environment is very much uh vulnerable uh although we do not have deserts now but we have some areas in this country which are threatened uh by the desert and we you uh we have some clear examples in Shinyanga Region and there's there are other regions which are threatened like Iringa Mbeya uh and others So as long as you have a rapid population uh their demands for fuel their demands for areas to cultivate they increase the people increase uh the number of cattle they have and the other animals and all these have got a bearing on our environment uh and this is not to mention urban areas where uh the population problem is being felt In areas like Dar es Salaam and and other towns uh and particularly in some regions like uh Kilimanjaro they really feel the pinch of the problem of population growth Another area which I think we should mention uh is the from the health point of view From this point of view we have one of the questions is malnutrition We have a big problem of malnutrition in this country Almost fifty per cent of our children under five have uh malnutrition Most of it is moderate but uh five to eight per cent is severe malnutrition uh This is because they don't get enough to eat uh Although we can say that there are some areas in this region where food is growing is in plenty but still we find that we have this problem in quite a number of areas and uh malnutrition is generally a problem But uh I would like to uh to concentrate mainly on the health of the mothers which is very much affected by uh too early pregnancies close too close pregnancies and also too late pregnancies When I say too early I mean where women or young mothers decide to have children before they are physiologically or they are their bodies are able to have children and they and therefore uh well let's say not only physiological but also socially and mentally uh ready to have children to rear them in the way that <ea/>Mama Nsekella has explained And also uh there are a lot of dangers that uh that mothers face when they < />ha when they have their children too close uh between if they have their children uh within a year or two it may be very dangerous for the health of the mother so we so it is uh being uh we try to promote this idea of spacing the children And also getting the children too late over thirty-five over thirty-five years of age it is often dangerous for the mother Now the major problem that we see is maternal mortality that is death in uh in women that  occurs during the process of childbirth or during pregnancy And in Tanzania about four thousand uh mothers die every year uh from childbirth or also during pregnancy This is a very high rate compared to our uh colleagues in the developing countries in the developed countries and it appears uh that this is almost forty-six times the level that is seen in the developed countries Apart from that you we get the problems of maternal <O/> that is uh the illness that is associated if they don't die Sometimes they get some severe damage to the soft tissues some become infertile uh others become uh immobilized for quite a long time in hospital So all this is associated with uh childbirth Another area which I think is very important to look at is a question of the effect of uh the death of the mother on surviving children It has been found that in quite a number of studies that uh if a mother dies the chances that uh her child if the child is under one the the chances that that child will survive beyond the first year are very low almost uh eighty to ninety-five percent of these children die if their mothers die at birth uh But coming back to your question I think when you look at uh at these problems which have been raised uh one of the interventions which uh we're promoting is family planning As <ea/>Mama Nsekella said we provide family planning and we promote uh family planning because it allows the families to plan their next child Uh And planning means the mother I mean the couple husband and wife should come should discuss as to when they would like to have their next child and we have the means to for to help them postpone the next pregnancy until such time that they feel they're ready to have the next one", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '109cfe9a-56fa-489a-ba8b-350ac14729bb', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.038099+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': "<$E> Meeting of the Minds Hello and welcome to our discussion programme known as Meeting of the Minds the second and last instalment to discuss population and family planning Last week we finished off with <ea/>Mama Christine Nsekella talking about how in the olden days both boys and girls were adequately prepared to take up their parental roles She was critically examining the problem of experimenting in sex very early in life with little or no preparation Members of the panel include Dr Flavian Magari National Programme Officer with United Nations Population Fund Dr Ali Mzige Senior Medical Officer in the Ministry of Health Mrs Christine Nsekella Executive Director of Tanzania Family Planning Association and Mr Ulinyeluswa Tenyende Assistant Director Human Resource Planning The Moderator is Leonard Mtawa and Dr Magari picks where <ea/>Mama Nsekella left off \n<$B> I would like to take uh <ea/>Mama Nsekella's uh point a little further uh It is a fact today that uh the norms that uh were prevalent during her times when she was young are no longer uh prevailing During those times uh traditionally we had <ea_><ea/> which was a way uh to teach the young people young men and young women uh on changes during adolescent changes during when they grow up become adults they were taught about uh what to expect when they get married or when they marry They were also taught about how to take care of their families But due to the developments uh and children have got to stay in school for a long time and uh you know families have moved into towns and so on these norms are no longer being practised in the majority of cultures So we have to find alternative ways of imparting that education to the young generation and as she said one way is to introduce uh what we call family life education in schools and in fact I would like to point out here that uh there is a project which is being assisted by UNFPA in the Ministry of Education that is family life education project with the aims uh which have been stated i e to improve or to uh bring awareness among the schoolchildren uh about uh their the biology and uh issues related to environment issues related to growing up and so on So we hope that when this project becomes operational in the country we should be able to have our children at least to get some information about growing up and uh family life education another project uh which is being sponsored by uh the United Nations Population Fund is uh family life education with the with <ea/>wazazi which a part-time Masai organisation uh whereby we are also trying to see how uh the parents can play their role to educate their sons and daughters in order for them to understand what it means to grow up uh in a way to improve communication between parents and children in the whole question of family life uh There's another big project under the prime minister's office that is uh population and family life education uh based in Arusha but also operating in about six regions and again uh it is trying in a way to impart knowledge of about population and economic development through extension workers and also trying to reach the grass-roots through the extension workers\n<$A> <ea/>Mama Nsekella I have a small question here Now uh don't you think that it is possible to revive the old norms\n<$C> Well uh this is why I brought it up uh because I knew it is possible We still have some very good norms within our society whereby uh we can be uh of help to those that are engaged in teaching and training young people so that it can be integrated within the society especially in adult education classes so that when the kids from school or they are on leave or holiday they can be looked after by the older generation and be taught some good behaviour as to how they should relate themselves to opposite sex uh not only on matters relating to sex but to general good behaviour in society so that our children can continue to be responsible and growing to a responsible society later on uh We still think that uh such people that have been able to pass on uh good norms to younger generation could be usefully uh be utilised by the school systems in the parents' committees in the parents' association by passing on the good behaviour and good way of living in a community especially in the rural areas and in the urban areas\n<$A><ea/>Ndugu Ulinyeluswa Tenyende there is uh this question of economic crisis uh among the young people be uh women or men I How can you relate with the current population problem \n<$D> Yeah these problems you have stated particularly youth unemployment problems uh are very much related to the population situation As you know we practise we have achieved universal primary education in Tanzania and as you're also aware that it's a very small proportion which continues to go beyond uh primary school education about less than six per cent Now it means that among say five hundred thousand youths who complete class seven every year go into the labour market seeking jobs A labour market which is not capable to absorb them That by itself is a problem uh and that is why the government now  realises that it has to have some policy a population policy to tackle these problems uh A policy which also aims to streamline the existing population programmes like family planning uh programmes family life education programmes so that they are united together to solve this population problem You know most of these problems can't be solved by saying that uh you what you have to do is to family plan you see or take people back to the rural areas Actually these are most of them socio-economic problems and therefore sometimes solutions are in the social field And what we are saying that to make the whole thing complete to uh to make development planning complete we have uh to consider all the problems together you see The numbers of people it's like water you know When you have too much water it's a problem We are always working on average Even fire itself it's very useful you see If you don't make use it of it properly It's the same with numbers of people We are saying that we have to be growing in a manner which it helps the nation's and individual's development in Tanzania and that is why the government also decided to come up with a population policy which we hope soon it will be adopted \n<$A> Dr Flavian Magari you as the national programme officer in the United Nations Population Fund uh maybe we would like to know uh what actually what is specifically is being done by your organisation on this question of interelations of population and family planning problems \n<$B> Most parents particularly in the rural areas favour to have large families One for one for one reason that uh they aren't quite sure whether all of them will survive That's one problem Of course the others uh another reason people may have is security and maybe there could be others In any case when it comes to ensuring survival of the children uh our role is to ensure that we have good uh maternal and child health services mother and child health services uh A lot has been done in this country to expand primary health care services to the country in such a way that uh more than seventy per cent of the population is within walking distance from the near from the nearest health unit And therefore uh these clinics these dispensaries which provide uh maternal and child health care have a big role to play in order to ensure that first the mothers uh get good care while they're pregnant and when they deliver and also the children that are born are immunised they're given uh all the care that is needed in order to make them survive Now if we can make these children survive then that reason for having a larger family uh becomes not uh a non-issue and therefore our organisation uh is working hand in hand with the Ministry of Health to strengthen as well as to expand uh mother and child health services and family planning services in the country in order to meet uh the demand for these services So that is one area where we are very much uh uh active in The other area of course as I say is this whole area of raising awareness about uh uh population issues about uh uh health issues uh family planning issues among the general population among leaders uh what government party and religious leaders So we have got to tackle the problem not just from uh one angle but from various  angle><+-angles> Raising awareness uh improving information to the people improving the services and we hope through all this people will be in a position to make uh uh rational decisions to have the families that they need the size of the families that they need that they can afford to keep healthy economically stable socially stable spiritually stable also \n<$A> Can you mention the problem of work in executing your functions on this particular area of population and family planning I mean how do you go about executing your uh your functions \n<$B> uh In fact our role really is to support the government Our projects are executed by the government So the government comes up with a programme or a project which aims at improving let's say uh services in the clinics mother and child health services and family planning services in the clinic and then we look at the project we come to agreement as to uh the rationale of this uh of the proposal and our organisation uh goes ahead if it if the project is approved go ahead to uh get funds to the government uh to get the activities done So that is the way we operate So our projects are really operated by the government but we are partners\n<$A> <ea/>Ndugu Tenyende maybe for the benefit of our listeners I propose that you give them you give us the national stand on that that is you explain the population policy How is it \n<$D> A population policy aims at solving problems which come from population growth rate and population characteristics One area is health for example We are talking that mortality in Tanzania is very high compared to other countries Mortality is an aspect of population it's a component of population change and mortality we don't it's something which everybody uh fights and it is one of the enemies the nation has declared war that is disease Now a population policy will emphasise and put more energy effort towards eradicating disease and reducing death in the nation We have already mentioned that uh the population growth rate is high both by historical standards in Tanzania itself and by world standards \n<$A> Maybe before going further\n<$D> Yeah\n<$A> I would like to know is there are any policy of that kind \n<$D> No there is no policy of that kind I think I made it clear right from the beginning that the government is now aware of these problems and therefore it is trying to come up with a policy which I think it may be adopted soon We don't have a population right now I am only saying what a population policy can be doing \n<$A> Yeah so we should also say that the delay for having such policy is also one of the reasons of the problems now facing the areas of population\n<$D> No I I wouldn't say so\nI wouldn't say so because population is a very sensitive area It is not only related to the number of the population It is also related to the quality of the population There are some population policies which aim for example to further certain characteristics of the population uh You would you wouldn't like to see in your population a certain type of people and therefore your population policy would be geared towards the removing those characteristics in the population that is also population and therefore we want to be sure that the population that we shall be coming with coming up with is really constructive population uh a policy", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$A> Yuh and Mr Willy I am really thinking of uh a certain issue which is about faith and peace I think that these two issues are a bit related How do you find it \n<$B> What terms what did you say \n<$A> I am introducing uh something about faith and peace\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> The way I see it I think that faith has an influence on one's peace Uh peace uh peace in terms of uh calmness for example spiritually and all calmness maybe uh uh intellectually or calmness even uh the outlook of a person All these symbolise a peaceful attitude of a person And I think that faith has contribution to influence one's peace\n<$B> To me I find it uh something that cannot be really You cannot conclude that this and that uh have got any contribution to one's Well I don't know I don't know Maybe you explain this in deeply \n<$A> Yah uh in fact what I'm saying is uh that when one has faith in God Of course to be specific I I'm referring to religious faith that uh when one believes that indeed there is God and tries his best or tries her best to live according to uh God's uh wish In this way one finds himself or herself uh satisfactory because he knows that uh he's living according to God's wishes\n<$B> Maybe because you have to find something which will motivate somebody in order to believe that there is a God We for example there are some people who'd never />a agree whether there is a God or not So unless you motivate you introduce somebody that this is God there is this there is something like that But it is not easy really to accept there is God because where is He People some people tend to ask you these things There is no God people are I mean people always tend to think there is no God so when you say when you somebody believes in God then have peace in Him then there is this and there is I don't think that is \n<$A> Well yes what you are saying is true and it is very very unfortunate that part some people don't believe that there is God That is really true And I know some who uh really say that uh those who believe in God are conservative and they also say that going to pray is a waste of time uh but\n<$B> You believe that is that God is around\n<$A> Of course Yes I believe\n<$B> What makes you\n<$A> so and \n<$B> But what makes you believe that there is God even around\n<$A> Well don't worry I'll just tell you I'll tell you about that I'm trying to go on you see uh It is it needs an experience because the starting point is a true belief that indeed there must be a source of everything and that source we Who can say uh it is the origin of everything is God God who said that everything should be there and that is a starting point Once you believe that there is God then you can see you can try to find out what does God want me to do and from that uh you can try to live according to the standard that God wants you to live for you see And when you achieve maybe a certain standard you become happy and you encounter a peaceful experience you see\n<$B> I just want the initial what you say the initial the initial start which will make somebody believe that there's God So if we introduce that we introduce the initial what you call the initial stage towards God's will maybe that's fun Maybe you can make me understand what you mean by initial Because I don't so far understand what do you mean when somebody gets an initial the initial stage that okay you have to tell somebody that God is like this God is like that then so that somebody can understand that the initial stage and then from there then you start maybe it's preaching or whatever or what But so far that is the initial What power what kind of power do one get just from the initial start Because uh to get that power I think you need to you a kind of a training really\n<$A> You see uh as I said before that the starting point or the initial point is to believe that there is God\n<$B> Right Now\n<$A> Once you believe that there is God then you pray to God\n<$B> all right\n<$A> asking God uh to enlighten you to know him more\n<$B> So what will make me because I can't just start to pray unless somebody maybe have come and tell me that you see you try to ask God for this and that so you'll and then you'll get what you have been asking But the initial position the initial what about I mean the initial uh which will make somebody I think you need to elaborate some kind of elaboration a bit \n<$A> Yes maybe it was \n<$B> because you see these things of faith when you talk of faith something I think is internal some it's a kind of power maybe which we don't know don't knowRRR where really it originates Where's the source of this power I think So when you talk of the initial I think that is just people's manipulation of language So that's what \n<$A> maybe to enlighten you about that it is good to take two approaches the scientific approach and the religious approach Uh on the scientific point of view normally uh the knowledge obtained from that uh uh view depends on experiments but uh religiously we depend on faith And uh what does this word faith mean It means uh when I have I haveRRR faith in you it means that what you say I take it as truth Now here uh when we naturally encounter uh problems uh uh especially critical problems it is there we realise that uh maybe God has deserted me even those who do not believe in God they can even say uh God help me It happens uh that is a natural a < />nat there is a natural uh experience which  enable<>+_enables> people sometimes to feel that they need God Now the only problem is how to strengthen this so that their faith becomes stronger And maybe I should introduce you to uh two forces which operate uh uh the within a person\n<$B> Maybe just tell me \n<$A> there is Satan Satan there is God \n<$B> Yes of course\n<$A> And normally Satan does not want us to believe in God and that's why we tend to ignore on the side of God because uh we are easily misled by those who uh believe otherwise\n<$B> So you are telling me that when people have got some problems and then they pray and then they are answered their problems so it's when they realise that God is there And therefore if you don't have any problem you don't pray then God is not there That's what you do that's what you mean \n<$A> No no not really\n<$B> Yah because you have said if you have some problems then you pray You get it Yes you tell somebody you go and pray and that's why people with problems when it when they mean when they prefer saying Oh God help me God do this for me Now So you mean that if you live without problems in this world you live without the problems then God is not there because you haven't you haven't got an opportunity to call God to help you because you don't have problems So if you don't have problems there's no God If you have got if you've ever got some problems then you have to call God to assist you That's what you mean\n<$A> Uh in fact there is a relationship in that because uh there are people because they are rich they tend to ignore on the religious side \n<$B> No I know\n<$A> There are people \n<$B> know I know a lot \n<$A> There are people \n<$B> I know a lot of people \n<$A> Yes I agree with you there are people who are rich and they believe in God and they pray hard but there are people who are rich also and they ignore because uh I know one person who uh who despised people who were talking about God and uh trying to lament the way people are behaving nowadays and when they sympathised with the way he told them he just neglected them and < />sai and said that his God is his computer you see And because he was well-off he thought that they are conservative and they are outdated you see And there are people who say they will find God when they have problems but people who have a problems normally they try to find solutions for them If they said then they say maybe God can help me And there are people indeed who uh encounter for example health problems and they go in different places uh to uh get cure and yet uh they are not cured and when they uh go to uh the believers they pray for them and even without medicine they get cured \n<$B> But you see \n<$A> and that that symbolises that uh God's power has uh helped them to become well\n<$B> But you see there are people Let me tell you there are people several of them I know that that they have been sick for quite a number quite a numberRRR of years They've been suffering They ve gone to the hospital They've gone to the medicineman They have gone everywhere to the witchdoctors you see They haven't been cured their diseases So you see what they say They say you see There is no God If God were there he could have helped me He's not here So I just wondering when you say all these things to the question of God is there the question of faith the question of what because there are those people with problems who have not been assisted even if < />G you say if we say that God is there and can help people So many that I think you might have this experience too that we've got people for quite a number of years sick for quite a number praying with I mean with well their faith I don't know whether it's what you are talking about faith is whether one needs to pray hard or not but with their faith and then they are dying with their problems then they ignore they tend to ignore that there is no God because if God was there if God or if Gods are there they could have helped us But you see if God is there and let me suffer with this for how for all these years How can I believe that there is God And if you say yes God is our Father He helps us Then he doesn't help you when you have some problems You suffer from the < />u day you are born until the day the day you die So I don't know\n<$A> You see we can uh cite some people who uh had problems and yet they were not uh their problems were not solved They uh prayed hard yet their problems were not solved And we can also cite some people who had problems and they were solved because they prayed hard uh It is not enough to pray hard One can pray hard and yet not believing You see Uh you remember if we take an example one person who had a skin disease and he was told to go to wash himself in the River Jordan and he saw no reason why he should go into that particular river He saw that in his place  />in his placeRRR there are many rivers and he can he always goes to wash himself in those rivers and so he saw no reason of going to wash himself in the River Jordan But uh his advisers said well you have come to this person to seek help and the advice he has given you is to just to go to wash yourself into that river", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '53df3f9e-831c-4418-a49e-5424c39163ae', 'added':

{'text': "<$A> Welcome to our discussion programme known as Meeting of the Minds In this edition <ea/>gombe week is revisited and hence we join panellists who discussed Does pegging wildlife to the dollar enhance conservation Taking part are Mrs V D Mtefu from the Board of External Trade Mr B N Samaira from the Export Promotion Department Directorate of Economic Research and Policy Bank of Tanzania Mr John Boshe from World Wildlife Fund for Nature Dar-es-Salaam branch and Dr Kriske of Seluu Conservation Programme Mr B N Samaira starts the ball rolling\n<$C> The subject of conservation is widely known to everybody and for Tanzania the question of foreign exchange is also an open game So in approaching conservation strategies in Tanzania which sometimes to a great to a great extent touches some areas of forest generation uh it is very difficult indeed uh Someone has discussed values of conservation vis-à-vis forex generation Now what I can say in this particular subject is conservation this is uh something to be maintained as for heritage for the coming generation and foreign exchange is also a crucial issue because this is the one which uh can put our current and coming generation to order In this respect I would like to say that conservation should be done uh be doneRRR but at the same time uh foreign exchange uh generation should be given its due uh say its due treatment What I mean in this area is the government or the Tanzanian society being in a very serious  economic uh position may overlook some issues which might erode our conservation because of hunting dollars It is here when we can overlook say the issue of say exporting uh timber or exporting some vital uh government trophies because of hunting dollars We can concentrate on these issues but at the same time actually we are we are eroding our national heritage we are eroding our uh forests which in the future might pose a very good uh very goodRRR uh reserve for our generation In this aspect therefore uh whenever we are approaching these two issues one should be cautious as not to take the advantage of the other to swallow the other one As the discussion goes I might be in a better position to address myself Thank you very much\n<$A> I think the most important message here passed by Mr Samaira to the audience is that we need foreign currency and we need to conserve our  resources but in order to do both we have to try to the best of our ability to strike uh a balance uh May I now call upon Mrs Mtefu from the Board of External Trade uh to highlight his idea her ideas on the Does pegging wildlife to the dollar enhance conservation\n<$B> Thank you Mr Chairman With me I could say that pegging wildlife to the dollar sometimes maybe to some extent it can also enhance < />con conservation It only depends on the policies of the nation on that maybe if you are going to earn the foreign exchange and then utilising it to buy other things instead of concentrating on conserving the wildlife itself so on my part I could say that the government or the policy makers should have a deliberate and co-ordinated  efforts><+-effort> to make sure that what is earned from the wildlife is utilised to conserve wildlife itself There's no need of saying that we are conserving wildlife to the to the extent that the country is going to lose foreign exchange because as far as wildlife is concerned it's not the heritage of Tanzanians only It's for the whole world And if it's for the whole world it means some countries are all countries have the right to come and maybe have a look at the at what we have in Tanzania And by doing so they are paying a fee and if we are earning a fee I would think that this type of earnings should be used to conserve wildlife Although the nation might be needing let's say dollars badly but conserving wildlife to my on my side I think it's a very important aspect otherwise there will come a time that it will only be in the books that Tanzania used to have such and such kind of things It will only be history and to some extent it will be forgotten So in order to let's say to make the world enjoy what we have we should conserve and if we have to conserve we have to use money to conserve and the money must come from the sector itself or from other government from other sources but to me I think that we can we should have a < />co co-ordinated and deliberate  effort And the second point is that we should also have proper training because those people who are dealing with let's say from the Bank of Tanzania or from the Board of External Trade People are only looking at the dollar aspect of it Nobody is aware of the conservation part of the whole thing So there should be proper training to all those who are concerned in the sector maybe from not only from the wildlife sector but from those let's say all sectors which are inter-related in one way or another It's to such an extent that policies which are being passed by the government are well co-ordinated because you'll find the Department of Wildlife talking something about conversation conservation and then you'll find the Board of External Trade maybe promoting trade saying we have to export so we have to export non-traditional products and wildlife is one of them so you'll find that in some aspects there we have some contradictions one part is conserving and one part is trying to break the rule So proper training and education and maybe this co-ordination will enable us conserve our wildlife That's all Mr Chairman Maybe I'll be able to contribute more\n<$A> Thank you very much Mrs Mtefu In addition to uh emphasising the same uh concept of striking a compromise between the dollar and conservation Mrs Mtefu has brought in an additional idea and that is Sometimes quite a lot of the problems arise in the industry and which give the impression that maybe the dollar has been over-emphasised These problems arise because of some form of communication breakdown so she's suggesting in the industry that there should be some form of education or training or a mechanism of two-way communication between the conservationist on one side and the bankers and the people from the external trade uh Having said that I would like to thank Mrs Mtefu and then call upon uh Mr Boshe Mr Boshe is a professional teacher and he has indicated to want to stop to uh to deliver what he has to us while standing up and I have no objection to his uh delivering his talk while he is standing up\n<$D> The subject matter we are talking about is very interesting and very very important but I consider that it has been presented in a rather provoking way uh pegging wildlife to the dollar does pegging wildlife to the dollar enhance conservation This may be rather provoking to conservationists but I think this has been done purposely in order to uh to stimulate discussion Now my interpretation of the subject really is commercial versus subsistence use of wildlife That's the way I look at it and I think that's what we are trying to address here uh Before I start maybe I should try to define what wildlife is To me a simple and clear definition of wildlife really would be uh its definition in its broadest sense to be all living entity in a natural area and this  includes plants animals and micro-organisms Now if we all agree to this definition we will see then there are several values of wildlife and this include commercial value recreational educational aesthetic catchment value and also source of food These are the main values of wildlife if we agree in this definition to start with Now we can see that most of these cannot have a dollar value attached to them It is very difficult to have monetary value attached to something like aesthetic value of wildlife or the catchment or the recreational or theRRR educational Now coming back to the question of use of wildlife I believe that wildlife just like any other resource must contribute to the national economy and also to the well-being of the people Therefore commercial use of the resource is essential Such commercial use can either be consumptive or non-consumptive Turning to the question of subsistence hunting or use of the wildlife it is now indisputable as I'm sure we will see during the afternoon session that all conservation efforts are likely to fail unless they have active and positive support of the local people I therefore believe that we conservationists and the responsible authorities have an obligation to demonstrate to the local people that conservation is for their interest by providing direct and tangible benefits of conservation to the local people Truly we can add and say that commercial utilisation of wildlife will eventually provide the needed benefit to the people We get tourists in the country we collect a lot of forex and the money goes to the government and uh we assume that this money will filter down to the local people but in reality when it comes to wildlife issues and the money generated by the wildlife the trickle-down theory does not work It does not apply The money goes to the government the government uses the money for development projects but the people living next door to the wildlife do not really see the contribution of wildlife to their well-being As you will agree with me I'm sure wildlife  occurs in land which  belongs to people Let us take the northern part of the country for example uh We have some of the most outstanding wildlife areas in the Arusha region and in Masai land This land belongs to the Masais traditionally and they have been there from time immemorial Now this wildlife is there because the form of land use practised by the Masai is compatible conservation Now things are changing Human population is increasing Human needs are increasing Lifestyle of the Masai is changing as well from pastoralists to start producing < />ag uh uh agricultural goods Now cultivating the land I am sure some of you would agree with me is not a compatible form of land use with wildlife conservation Now if we try to prevent the Masais for example from cultivating the land so that wildlife can survive then we have an obligation to make sure that the Masais get their basic needs If you look at uh the Chagga people for example in northern part of the country they have pieces of land which they have inherited from their forefathers This piece of land they grow banana as their food crop and coffee as a cash crop and they depend entirely on this small piece of land Now the Masais on the other hand have this land which  belongs to them There is wildlife there They cannot cultivate the land and grow food crop or cash crop So their cash crop really would be the wildlife on their land but then there isn't a mechanism which can provide direct income from wildlife to the Masai people So what I'm trying to drive at here is in addition to commercial utilisation of wildlife where we get some money forex for example here is also in need to uh support subsistence utilisation of wildlife for the purpose of providing the needed uh uh the basic needs for these people living next door to wildlife Now in conclusion Mr Chairman I would like to say that wildlife resource has a major role to play in both the national economy and in serving as a source of food to people especially to those communities living in and around conservation areas This therefore calls for both commercial and subsistence use of the resource Our main concern here though is the magnitude and extent of the use of this resource whether commercial or subsistence", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b685bbc2-8223-40d2-8bb1-6e12adedf47f', 'added':

{'text': "<$A> In December nineteen eighty-five the United Nations General Assembly created the fifth of December as International Volunteer Day It is a day which is to be celebrated by governments groups and individuals It is a day which is really set aside to pay tribute to all volunteers international volunteers as well as national volunteers We pay tribute to them for the good and sacrificial work they have been doing irrespective of their ages irrespective of their communities We pray we pay tribute to them for the really hard work that they've been putting in to improve the lot of mankind It is really a day which is significant for all volunteer spirit and the first celebration took place in nineteen eighty-six Since then it has been celebrated all over the world and here in Tanzania the first celebration took place in nineteen eighty-seven which was very  low-key but from nineteen eighty-eight it really took up in a very stylish manner and this year I believe it will be even more significant Maybe my colleagues would like to contribute\n<$B> Yeah Mr Mazuki would you like to contribute some more ideas as maybe to how Tanzania has participated in making International Volunteer Day significant\n<$C> Thank you Edda Maybe one point which uh I would like to say how Tanzania has participated is that the Ministry of Labour and Youth Development in collaboration with the DDS programme uh we have an exchange programme whereby we do receive DDS field workers from member countries in Africa and when they come here in Tanzania we post them into uh groups in rural areas where the young people are working together So these field workers are supposed to work with the youth groups in trying to raise their standard of living in the form of  organising some various projects uh related to agricultural  projects uh animal husbandry and so on And these field workers are supposed to stay for two years working with the group whereby after two years they can either uh extend their contract and stay for another two years or they can terminate and then go back and receive others And in this way actually we have seen quite a lot of the contribution made by this volunteer programme through the DDS programme\n<$B> Thank you Mazuki before you leave the chair maybe you could tell us the full name of DDS\n<$C> Uh DDS uh in full name means Domestic Development Service uh which really connotes that uh the volunteers have got to work at the grassroot level giving service to the communities at the village level\n<$B> Thank you Mr Mazuki Uh Mr Bwatei said that the day was inaugurated in nineteen eighty-five but it was not until nineteen eighty-eight that it was celebrated in a big way in Tanzania Now non-governmental organisations being what they are in working with the grassroot level men and women uh would you think Mr Halid Mika there is a way that we could involve the rural women and men and perhaps even the youth to participate in volunteering services\n<$D> Yeah uh thank you Edda I think I've something to add more about the IVD itself As far as I know that it creates the awareness to the people uh so that they could understand well the importance of the IVD uh also to understand what are the objects objectives of IVD uh in case of Tanzania and uh thirdly to understand how the people are they going to be involved in the voluntary services and whom are they uh expected to volunteer To my opinion uh awareness uh should accompany with the importance of using uh mass media uh both in printing and the electronic Mass media is important too in helping to draw the awareness of the people to understand what is the IVD This can be implemented by arranging features articles interviews in radio services as we are doing now uh in TV programmes distribution of handouts and leaflets as well as uh erecting posters educating the people to understand what IVD is and what are they supposed to do Therefore uh proper communication between mass media and uh national committee need to be maintained Uh maybe even to co-opt one member from mass media to the IVD national committee Secondly IVD  helps also to stimulate the people to involve uh *themself> themselves in voluntary work Such this day can bring together different categories of people as you asked me that women involving women and youth uh to engage in voluntary work service such as environmental uh cleaning especially in the urban areas uh tree planting in *deforestated> areas In another way the IVD  helps to mobilise the people in self-reliance activities Uh this will be discussed later I think so with my colleagues here But what I want to say here is IVD has helped to maintain the spirit of volunteerism in the country For example in Dar es Salaam alone uh the CCN youth organisation <*/VIJANA> uh have come up with their traditional style that every month they mobilize themselves and uh take part in city cleaning campaign which was launched by themselves last year This is an example which  shows that youth are in the forefront taking part on volunteer work without waiting until the IVD celebrations So you see uh they have already been stimulated and they are continuing these such this spirit of volunteering\n<$B> Thank you uh In as far as uh your explanation goes you talk about mass media and you mentioned some of the conventional media But maybe we should draw some experience from our colleague here Mr Bwatei as to how other forms of media have been used successfully to arouse interest and awareness amongst grassroot uh level people\n<$A> Well for specifically here in Tanzania what we've been doing for the past two years or so is that as far as media is concerned we begin with the press release which is usually published a day before the media event itself That is the day before fifth December and then on the fifth of December itself we come out with a feature article a big article supported with uh one or two pictures really field level activity and we have tried also to get radio discussion for what we are doing now which last year for one reason or the other it could not come on But I'm extremely happy that this year we've been able to come out with this radio discussion So we believe many people will get to know about the IVD either through the newspaper or through this radio discussion And of course this will be supported by some other field activities which will be undertaken which we have planned And the publicity aspect of these activities will also help a lot of people you know to understand and even just get to know that there is a day called IVD and to us this is very significant If I may add experience has shown that any time we celebrate the IVD many many Tanzanians flood the office of UNDP trying to offer their services as volunteers in some other countries And we try to recruit people of all professions accountants doctors nurses uh economists metalworkers woodworkers and so on And to me it is significant because by then we try to promote that public awareness to see what Tanzanians could also contribute by way of volunteerism\n<$B> Anything to add Mr Mazuki\n<$C> Maybe Edda what I need to add here is uh maybe the celebrations which took part last year that uh Actually what we did uh during the first week of December We organised quite a few programmes which were undertaken around Dar es Salaam For instance we had uh clean-up at the Magomeni market and also we had some clean-up for around Muhambili uh hospital and also we had some clean-up along the shores And the climax of this celebration uh we had some seminar whereby some speeches were given and discussions which uh all the volunteers in Tanzania from all over the country came to Dar es Salaam and discussed the importance of this uh International Volunteer Day And right now what we are planning to do is that maybe instead of organising these celebrations in Dar es Salaam we are planning to decentralize so that within the regions they can organise themselves and plan what activities can be undertaken through uh the Volunteer Day And I think this is what we planning in the future uh to do\n<$B> Thank you Mr Mazuki uh Halid what do you think non-governmental organisations could do to make this spirit of volunteerism linger on throughout the year and not remain just as a day of the fifth of December from uh one year to another\n<$D> Briefly I could say that we have an action programme of which we are going to involve all uh NGOs in the country so that they could do take part \n<$B> Thank you Mika Uh Mr Bwatei is there a way that UA uh UNDP will make a follow-up of all the projects and plans that will have been uh drafted so that they are ongoing from year to year and also to keep the interest of those who like volunteering to go on and on \n<$A> Okay well uh UNDP has some contribution to make but then I would like to take the opportunity to correct  the impression that the day or the IVD is not for UNDP It is a day set aside for all volunteers both international and national Of course UNDP comes in as a catalyst you know to set certain things in motion But here in Tanzania the national focal point for IVD celebration is the Ministry of Labour and Youth uh Development 'cause now they are working hand in hand with the with TANGO so very soon TANGO will also be taking an active role in the celebration The reason why UNDP does not want to give that impression is that people would begin to say that Oh the day is for UN you know which is not the case It is for the Boy Scouts the Red Cross the Girl Guides YMCA and what have you It so it also includes the bilateral volunteers like the US Peace Corps the German volunteers the Swedish volunteers the Finnish and so on So that has a global perspective and that is why UNDP plays a role but the day itself is not for UNDP But as you mentioned we try to work in conjunction with the ministry and with all the parties You know it's a united effort It's a united effort so that by that we could sustain the spirit of volunteerism in all  aspects of our development\n<$B> <Hmm> Perhaps an argument would come about like in the case of Tanzania where there is development levy out of every Tanzanian be he a worker or peasant And there is this spirit of volunteerism then someone could say what is my money doing if there are youth every fifth of December coming to clean up the uh streets or the hospitals or whatever uh Can you give an explanation to this uh argument Mr Mazuki\n<$C> Thank you Edda I think what we need to draw here is the meaning of volunteerism I think this is uh very important It is important in the sense that uh development is actually brought about by the people themselves and that is when uh people understand I think what is now required is to raise the awareness I think that uh Mr \n<$A> Halid\n<$C> Halid had already mentioned about raising the awareness that if people understand that development comes by themselves that they need to contribute they need to put in effort Then when people pay development levy is to me what I understand is just a token because for instance if you take the amount which is paid as development levy it's really very little if you can put it or you translate it in the form of the kind of uh work which it can produce But if people understand that on top of the development levy still they are required to commit themselves to such activities which can bring about social and economic development that's where voluntarism comes in That here is someone who understand that it is my responsibility and it's my call it's my commitment to put my service to the development of the country to the development of the society", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '918f5f8a-55b0-41b0-845d-c8874e7c93b1', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.042598+00:00', 'english_score':

Yasser Arafat announced that uh you Palestinians now recognise Israel \n<$C> \n<$B> And I was even more surprised that uh Yasser Arafat even said that uh the Palestinians are suspending arms struggle that the arms struggle now is <foreign/>kaduuk is finished Maybe you hoped you hopedRRR that by doing that you are really you know uh you wanted support from America maybe America would support the International Peace Conference Maybe Israel also would be prepared to sit at the table and talk to PLO about peace But that didn't happen\n<$C> \n<$B> So far after all that time has gone after you recognised PL uh Israel <O/> suspended arms to America has not really recognized PLO and they are not prepared to talk to PLO Neither is Israel What do you think has been achieved by the overtures of the PLO And if you think that it has failed if it was a wrong step that you took now what are you intending to do after that \n<$C> Yah \n<$B> About that Thank you \n<$C> Thank you very much brother Actually this is a very tough question We ourselves Palestinians are trying to uh to answer it by our own our way Why Because as you said exactly we were or some of us or even in the Arab countries some of the Arab regimes are sometimes were telling us that well because of your policy because you want to liberate all Palestine and this is not realistic Our friends even in Soviet Union they say well this is not the policy You should be uh you know seeing the facts There is a new generation now in Israel And it is a de facto country since forty-five years And the old policies are not serving Actually our policies are very clear right from the very beginning Nineteen sixty eight is the date when we decided to build a secular democratic state of Palestine What do we mean by that Both Jews Moslems Christians regardless of religion would establish and there is enough room for everybody The Israelis consider this policy as very destructive to Israel In nineteen seventy-four we had endorsed in our resolution of the PNC to have two states And to have our independent state over any territory which is going to be released by Israel after the convening of the International Peace Conference which was supposed to be held in nineteen seventy-four by the way And still it's not convened So regarding our policy it came up to the corner What we had been asked for had been fulfilled from our part And we are doing it really not because we want to satisfy the international public opinion No because we like really to achieve peace We are people who are striving for peace Don't think that war is a good thing I mean to be in war it means to die And I don't think that there is something valuable than the life itself How about the life of the people themselves and their destiny How much you can live without knowing where to build a house and settle This is the tragedy of the Palestinian people It is not the matter of food and uh and to survive only There is what is called belonging Where you belong to And each time when you go and write an an any passport card all the time it is difficult for the Palestinian to say where is his residence Sometimes I write Tanzania Sometimes I don't know I write although I have a place where I belong to I want to be back to it Even if I don't go and reside there But still I belong to that place So you see because of this dream we are giving so much time for the peace So much room for the peace But at the same time we are not dreaming because we know the enemy what's also doing Maybe it is undiscovered for the international public opinion But those Palestinians who are there whom you have seen now in the video they know exactly what is Israel and what Israel is planning for them Israel is planning to replace them all by the new Jews coming from abroad They know it This is why they are resisting on the struggle But the struggle is not only armed What do you call these stones Isn't it an armed struggle Or it should be only with guns This is only a means This is an armed struggle when you have the kid the woman and everybody is involved Do you want a struggle which is much better than this one a peaceful one very innocent one which <O/> enough to be <O/>with terrorism This is the terrorism the organised terrorism which  uses all means of terrorism The well organised terrorism which is backed by a well organised state called the United States So we have to struggle in both politics diplomacy and also in the land This is exactly what we are doing and we don't have any dreams and we know that this conflict is going to be resolved in our right but it needs a lot of factors also to play its role The regional role is not playing yet It has its own difficulties Economic difficulties There are so many shortages around us and our brothers So many conflicts here and there also are disabling the balance of forces in the area which is not bringing peace But from our part I think our duty is to continue and not to wait for these factors and we have to keep the blood bleeding all the time so that the issue would remain alive in the minds and in the hearts of our Arab nation as well as around the world as a whole I think it is an international commitment and it is an international responsibility after all Those who had voted to create such a state have now to check what kind of resolution they had adopted in nineteen forty seven They aimed to secure a little bit of Jews who had been I mean succeeded to survive from the Second World War but the cost was another trouble for an all entire people and *uninstability> in an area which is very rich of interest for everybody They have now to check and see whether this is just or not and they have also to play their role I think it is not only our duty as the Palestinian people it is a duty of so many forces around the world And it is an international uh uh uh responsibility after all So we are going to continue my brother\n<$B> In your response to my earlier question you said that the United Nations headquarters has got copies of the nineteen forty-seven agreement \n<$C> yah\n<$B> which demarcated how the Palestine state should be and what borders the state should have I have two questions One How do the western countries like or the United States you know Britain and France how do they want to solve the Palestinian problem Will they have a plan of solving the problem because I have not heard about it I know that there is they do send the foreign ministers to Damascus to Baghdad to other Arab countries to Cairo but I have not have notRRR seen a comprehensive plan for solving the Palestinian problem from the western point of view Secondly the presence of the western troops in the Middle East now is it so much to it so muchRRR a question of oil or the interest for oil or is there a plan to say to dislodge the Palestinian problem from world prominence \n<$C> Uh I have the opinion that the opinion inside the West generally what is called the West had developed rapidly It is true that uh since nineteen forty-eight the positions in so many western countries European United States and so on  were uh let's say uh very alignated with Israel stands where there is no Palestinian state uh where I do not know what I mean so many approaches which do not meet even with a minimum of the Palestinian rights But now it is not so This had developed and I have to tell you frankly as you can see I mean the whole European community almost all are recognising the rights of self-determination of the Palestinian people This had been declared in Venice in Madrid France almost all European I mean and even from the Parliament and on the official level I should tell you although we are not recognised in so many European states as embassies but de facto we are embassies there and they deal with us so uh Well in some of these countries especially the Mediterranean ones say the I mean the French position the Italian position the Greek position as well as the Spanish Go to Scandinavia where the Swedish position is so much advancing the Austrian one I don't want to name the whole list but I can tell you that these positions are so much clearer nowadays And they are in support for a resolution of the conflict on the basis of realising our national rights and mainly the right for self-determination which could lead to an independent state as a matter of fact And they recognise also PLO as the sole legitimate representative of our people which means that it is a full party Now who is left as a matter of fact if we have to be sincere to the truth it is the American position which is still delaying the train to move to its station Because as you have seen also the idea and the resolution to convene the International Peace Conference had been agreed upon almost from all countries around the world The United States also had shown some interest in the idea But they have different approaches actually towards solution of regional conflicts That you know yourself That they want to be the god-father of any solution themselves not the international legality So this is the way they had done it in various regions and they want to be the sponsor for the peace as if that the peace has got a father The father of peace should be the United Nation which everybody now wants it to play its role But when it goes to the Palestinian problem the United States no They don't want to involve the United Nations They veto a resolution to send a fact-finding mission on behalf of the Security Council while they can get thin resolutions from the Security Council in one month So they are very selective in using the international legality because they want also their interests to be served by themselves And I tell you the oil the barrel of of oil which they like now to sit on Later if they succeeded to do so they are going to bargain both Japan the European Community and so many powers how much they should pay for that barrel This is why they don't like to involve the United Nation that much in our issue because also they want to have a different approach in solving these issues the way it goes in their interest not the ways where the just lies This is why we are pushing to that direction We don't say that we want peace which could be done by the United States No We stress upon the need to have the security council members along with all parties including the PLO because we are a full party where the United Nation is the sponsor Not the United States is the sponsor This is how we see the approach towards a solution of our uh issue That is what the Americans do not like to see They had proposed the self-rule and sometimes they talk about well Baker should come and see what are the possibilities", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '3acdea23-5837-49c7-b520-ceac6eb1d171', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.043537+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9821793437004089,

\nAnd now on the comments This week the Daily News of Thursday July twenty-first had a comment on supporting the women projects and the editor says there are allegations that women contribute proportionately more of their income to family welfare than do men who hold back more for personal and individual consumption Studies made in several countries especially the developing ones have found that wives account for more than forty per cent of the total household income although their wage rates are far lower than those of their husbands The studies made in developing countries such as Mexico have proved the allegations to be true in the sense that they have found that while husbands contributed at most seventy-five per cent of their earnings to the family budget the women contributed a hundred per cent of theirs This means that in many countries it is the mother's income or food production that determines the relative nutrition of children in families The editor goes on to write Tanzania is not an exception in regard to the above situation and it is an open secret that some Tanzanian men spend most of their incomes on booze and other irrelevant issues leaving the heavy burden of raising their families squarely on the shoulders of their wives This unfortunate situation has extreme <O/> effects one of them being family disintegration which results in parents abandoning their children for nature to take care of them With the current national and the international depression biting hard the problem of abandoning children otherwise known as street children

{'text': "<$A> Hello and welcome to the programme This is the fourth and final part on diabetes We'll continue discussing management of complications and Dr Jenga will start by telling us how they go about rehabilitating those patients whose complications are well set in\n<$B> When the patients get affected or they come to us or later with eyes affected we have uh the unit of eye specialists who already actually have a method of uh treating this uh retinapathy But the kind of treatment that is offered is also not curative it doesn't cure but it improves the sight So such patients still if they're already having problems we still advise them to come and see us because we can direct them <O/> to the right specialists and they can be given there the proper management end up with glasses once they have had operations and in fact not just for the retina being affected Some patients who are diabetic get cataracts very early and these can be removed very easily and the patient continues seeing\n<$A> Yeah that's right We looked at uh the causes of uh of diabetes last time in the last two episodes and uh one we want to know what part uh do the members of the family for example play in rehabilitating or helping this patient live to as near normal life as possible And whether uh that <O/> families I mean to say one you have one person in the family who is diabetic what concern should actually the family undertake\n<$B> That's a very very good question Mr <name/> because uh it just reminded me of the National Diabetic Association They have a programme which is very interesting Every year they run diabetic camps and these diabetic camps it's not just the diabetics who attend We invite them with their relatives Because this way you educate the relatives If it is the child you educate the father the mother and if it is the father you educate the wife and the children about diabetes Because this way then they will know that this person doesn't have a very extraordinary disease It's a disease that we all can cope with And the kind of support that family gives that particular individual who is affected really determines his quality of life And then all we also we need to tell them also is that diabetes runs in families like we said the last time \n<$A> Yes yes\n<$B> and there are some preventive measures the other members of families who are not affected that can actually adhere to avoid uh getting diabetes Like let's say if you have two members of two the husband and wife having diabetes chances of those three twenty-five per cent of the children getting diabetes are very high So what we tell them is that now that you know you have diabetes you have to actually modify the diet that is eaten by the whole family so that you don't start getting uh obese or overweight children 'Cause once they get become overweight the chances of them getting diabetes are very high and then you also tell them it's good to take the rest of the family for screening There is uh a method I told you the other day called <O/> test whereby you can screen all the members of that family and you will have a pointer saying you are likely maybe in times of stress of if you become pregnant or you undergo some form of infection you are you are likely to come up with diabetes If these things can be done early enough you are aware and you can have the measures we talked about Avoid sedentary life whereby you just sit Do some exercise Eat healthy diet Avoid too uh much carbohydrates And it's at that juncture that most of these patients can actually avoid or relatives can avoid refined sugars That way then you protect yourself\n<$A> Well that brings us to the other question What is a target group of this national diabetic association Do you take camps to schools for instance\n<$B> uh Well the uh what uh our chairman or our executive group has been doing and I is that they distribute these camps throughout the country and if they decide that this camp would be in Nairobi this year they just choose of a convenient point whereby most of the diabetics will be able to attend Last year it was in Nakuru the year before I think it was in Mombasa It has started even in Kisumu It's also going to be I think in Nyere You know when you have camps in towns we shall go during the holidays maybe uh request a school to give us the compound and maybe the dormitories so that they stay there for a week They spend the night there They get we get guest lecturers doctors and maybe nutritionists health workers uh sociologists to come and talk to them public health workers So that once they uh they get all the aspects of diabetes and there we invite and as I told you we don't just invite diabetics themselves we invite even people like you who's interested in taking care educating diabetics You will be invited You can be sure you will be invited the next camp Then we have other people even politicians who may be interested or local leaders because these are the people who really facilitate the welfare of these patients And they have a lot of questions They want to know why is this thing so expensive and it's a life-time drug Why are these things not available in this and this And eventually with this kind of questions you know their needs you know their problems you understand their fears and you will be able to address them better now that they have educated you also\n<$A> Okay Have you had one this year yet\n<$B> Yeah there's been one just about two weeks ago in Mombasa but we are going to have one in Nairobi in the in fact I think maybe later this month or early November uh which we will call a Diabetic Awareness week where we hope to go out to the streets and maybe inform the public about diabetes \n<$A> So it is actually important now that any member of public who is interested can be on the look out \n<$B> Yeah They should\n<$A> and attend these screenings \n<$B> Yes it will be it will be announced The National Diabetic Association executive chairman who has really been very active and he has really helped a lot of people\n<$A> Right Diabetes being a life-long condition uh disease for that matter I believe it has its own socio- and economic uh effects Let's look at the socio-effects The socio-effects or impact it has on the individual patient and his immediate family his job situation and of course his friends And how can we lift that up How can we lift the spirit up of these patients?\n<$B> Yeah that is a very very important view of this diabetes because on the social aspect most of the patients the minute they get diabetes they kind of feel they are secluded They feel that you know the disease has been so stigmatised that you think oh my how unfortunate I am to have diabetes so you kind of try to keep off You don't attend social gathering because when you go there you're scared maybe they'll be eating one two three and I'm not allowed to eat that and I don't want to keep on explaining to everybody I'm diabetic I don't want to eat this So their social life is curtailed you know They no longer feel free and I don't think it's it's proper for any patient to feel that they can't go to a party because they are diabetics because if you all appreciated that diabetes is just like any other disease will accept these people and make them feel more comfortable At their place of work some people don't even tell their bosses that they are diabetics Some collapse in the office and nobody has any idea they're diabetics But I always tell them please tell your boss tell your next mate tell your best friend that you're diabetic because those are the people who will save you and it's nothing to be ashamed of \n<$A> Could it be due to the fact that they may fear that their employer might sack them \n<$B> That is one thing\n<$A> And if at all that can happen could you please throw some word of advice to the employers themselves \n<$B> Well I think uh Mr Kariuki I would tell any employer what diabetic is that just because somebody has diabetes it does not really affect his output in his job So long as he comes for regular reviews and treatment and is managed well they should be no reason why he should not perform to his capacity like anybody else just like any other disease like hypertension We have so many hypertensive executives who are still working under medication so I cannot see why a diabetic should be uh should have any problems at his place of work because he has been uh kind of labelled that he is diabetic \n<$A> I see How about the economic aspect I what I have in mind is it's a long-term condition and the drug must be taken for as for that long I believe uh well they have there are financial constraints especially if they have to be taken for that long and I believe  \n<$B> Yes it is very true but what I'm happy about the Ministry of Health is that they're now trying very hard to just make sure that most of these essential drugs which are taken on kind of a long time uh you know like in diabetes uh drugs for hypertension epilepsy they are being made available And I know that people have been fighting for such drugs actually to become even cheaper in the in the pharmacies What is left is for all of us whoever we are drug manufacturers policy makers We find ways that we can actually minimise the cost for these patients because these are life-supportive drugs They can't do without them and actually most of them cannot afford to buy that insulin all the time So when it is not available in the government hospitals quite a number of our patients do suffer and this is where I know the policy makers the Minister of Health has actually promised to look into so if that one works then I think we shall have gone a long way to support our diabetic patients\n<$A> I see Let's look at uh some main some misunderstandings of diabetes \n<$B> \n<$A> One is that diabetes is a disease of the rich How true is that \n<$B> That's not true \n<$A> It's not true\n<$B> It is not true\n<$A> Okay It is not a disease that is associated with witchcraft at all\n<$B> Oh no there is no witchcraft to it and that's why there is no way a witchdoctor will heal or cure diabetes because it doesn't have anything to do with witchcraft No\n<$A> And how much contribution does diet lead to uh having diabetes\n<$B> Well if you are already predisposed genetically like we said the other time if you start eating a very heavy you know diet that weighs more towards carbohydrates then you are promoting your chances of uh getting diabetes You're improving them So what I could say is a diet is very important if you are already predisposed And then when you get diabetes diet becomes also a very major issue in that it's not that we keep on telling you Don't do it eat this don't do it eat this don't do the other What we say is that Eat the correct food We'll try and find out where it's available for you in the community or where you come

{'text': "<$A> Good evening and welcome to the Professional View This is a weekly programme in which we invite professionals to come and discuss their work with us and hence to enlighten us on that work particularly when it is work or a profession that has a bearing on the country's development Now Kenya has made tremendous progress in the field of education The biggest segment of our budget is spent on this important service to the nation but one area within this general field of education that has received comparatively little attention is the field of Special Education This is education for the minority amongst us who because of a certain impairment either of hearing of seeing or a mental impairment are not able to enter the standard pre-primary uh primary and secondary institutions in the country and therefore they need a special institution or unit or school where they can get the benefit of education So tonight we decided to focus on that special area within the field of education that is Special Education and we have invited to this studio of the Professional View experts who are going to enlighten us on the nature of the problems facing the impaired and their education and also to discuss with us what is being done by way of redressing the balance and giving the handicapped their due share of education and its benefits Let me introduce the four guests to you On my extreme left we have Mrs Catherine Abila Mrs Abila is the Director of the Kenya Institute of Special Education This institute will form the subject of much of our discussion tonight On my middle left is someone who is I'm sure familiar to regular viewers of the national television screen He's Mr Don Menya Mr Menya is a member of the Kenya Institute of Special Education Management Council and I said that he's a familiar face or figure in the nation because for many years he was chairman of the Kenya Society for the Disabled On my immediate right we have Mr <name/> Mwagiri Mr Mwagiri is the Director of Studies at the Institute which I shall call for short KISE Kenya Institute of Special Education Last but not least we have on my extreme right Mr Lawrence Kariuki and Mr Kariuki is the Head of Department for the Visually Handicapped Right Lady and Gentlemen let's begin with a bit of history As an historian I'm interested in how things have started Uh one gets the impression that the education of the disabled for many years particularly colonial days used to be run entirely by private organisations charity organisations and missionaries and so on and I think it's only since independence that the Kenya government has deliberately and consciously felt the need to be a participant Will you enlarge on this <ea/>Bwana Menya\n<$B> Well when we got our independence we had a priority to educate the able-bodied children in Kenya to come and man the civil service and for those expatriates who are living so that was a priority of the government It was also a priority of the parents who wanted to educate their children so that they can get jobs eventually and help them the parents Consequently the education for the disabled was not a priority at that particular time because most of this was being carried out by voluntary organisations and church organisations So education for the deaf the physically handicapped the blind and the mentally handicapped was lagging behind But the awareness came at around the early eighties mostly when the President uh raised uh millions of shillings twenty-two millions to start with at Uhuru Park for the disabled and after the United Nations had declared that I think eighty-one was going to be the Year of the Disabled that awareness grew up and then parents and everybody else became aware and then eventually negotiations started with uh donor agencies to help find a place where we can train teachers for these various disabilities At that time they were being trained at various places like Highridge Teachers Training College Kamwenja and others But then when a donor agency came in which we're going to talk about later and a site was found at Kasarani to build Kenya Institute for Special Education And that is the time that the Legal Notice of 1986 was uh made by the government and the board was set and KISI that's when it started at that time to train among other things uh children uh teachers for various disabilities and also to train uh people who are going to man these technical skills and many other skills and also to train assessors who are going to go into the field to assess people with various disabilities and thereafter refer them to where they ought to be\n<$A> Right We'll deal in detail with those aimed objectives of the institute but to go back a little it it's estimated that or at least we're told by the World Health Organisation that something like ten per cent of the total population of any country has some handicap or the other Now that's quite a high figure Would you say that perhaps Mrs Mbila that Kenya's population that ten per cent is handicapped Is it more perhaps than that or less\n<$C> Mr Chairman I think in the absence of the actual statistics and figures we continue to use those figures that are used by the World Health Organisation and therefore we can assume that uh the ten per cent that uh is quoted applies in this country However it's also important to know that there have been quite a lot of deliberate efforts to do research A census was carried out to determine the number of disabilities that are there during the last census We now have assessment centres which have been established throughout the country and in each district there is an assessment centre and sub-centres which can identify the number of uh disabled persons that we have And particularly the children who have been benefiting from this programme So it is still true to say that out of those assessment centres and out of the researches that have been conducted and out of the census uh results that we have had the number is extremely large and that is why this uh institute uh is there to look at the various needs and particularly the training of manpower to man some of the programmes which have already been established in the country\n<$A> Okay That's to come the discussion of the centre Now but in order to really appreciate the important role the centre is playing it would be I think interesting <ea/>Bwana Mwagiri to know something about the shortcomings of the various schools and units where these disabled children are taught In other words the institute is there to in many ways rectify some of the shortcomings of these schools and units So in your estimation quantitatively and qualitatively uh what is wrong with these present units and schools What are their shortcomings Apart from the fact that they tend to be largely in towns so that the rural areas don't seem to benefit much\n<$D> Thank you Mr Chairman I think the biggest problem that a lot of our schools and units are facing is the aspect of uh personnel There aren't enough uh teachers trained or specialised uh to teach in those schools and units Uh In the recent say two year in the last two years a lot of units have been opened throughout the country particularly in the area uh the mentally handicapped And the teachers are not there in fact some districts have been forced to start schools or units with uh somebody who has no training at all So there is a great need to train uh a lot of manpower to man these schools and units that are scattered all over the country\n<$A> Okay So that is one yes that's one major shortcoming Let's have uh then we'll come back to you <ea/>Bwana Menya Do you know any other shortcomings <ea/>Bwana Kariuki\n<$E> I think what he has explained is uh quite valid especially in the education for the blind but uh much so it's a fact that most of our schools are residential and the children have to come from their homes sometimes very far to these schools and to start a residential school for the blind for example takes a lot of money and as students are increasingly being identified we are finding that we don't have uh enough of such residential schools and there's need to have more units to cater for children in their home environment where they can be with their parents and benefit from peer group and their local environment\n<$A> Yes <ea/>Bwana Menya you wanted to add more to\n<$B> Yes the problem of with the units as we have them now is that we have a unit in a primary school maybe one classroom And that one classroom that child will be there in that classroom this year and again the following year and the following year without being upgraded to say Grade one two three four as the others Children in the same school where there's integration move in eight-four-four up till they do their examinations So this child continues to be in the same classroom year in year out and there is no opening So uh the plan I have now should be to see how to upgrade these children this unit so that they can branch out into rehabilitation workshops and sheltered workshops so that they can be seen to be progressing that the parents see them progressing beyond going into one class and they ask you your child is still in the same class it was \n<$A> It is demoralising to the child and the parents\n<$B> It's demoralising Then it is also a factor of uh parents are still particularly of the mentally handicapped of the stigma of their children being exposed as being disabled and handicapped and they don't bring their children to assessment centres And also there's a lot of cultural barrier in certain areas of Kenya where the handicapping conditions are looked down upon very seriously and I view this throughout Africa where I have been attending meetings that some areas people just don't want to talk about mentally handicapped I can tell you that in Kenya luckily we have several units nearly a hundred now but in our neighbouring countries there are some that have no unit or no school at all But Kenya is leading and I hope that the progress we're making now will just improve on what we have and uh try to sort out the shortcomings\n<$C> I think uh Mr Chairman can I add it is important for the viewers to understand that these units are there to encourage integration That is a main purpose so they will vary from one discipline to the other In the area of mental handicap what Menya has said it is true that we need to look beyond that one classroom and encourage a lot of other rehabilitation programmes that can make them effectively become integrated into the programmes Those who can achieve academic as well as social integration obviously they will move to another class but because of lack of special schools that can accommodate the severe handicapped mentally handicapped children should be taken to a residential school where they can benefit and move on to a sheltered workshop We have uh integration programmes for the visually handicapped which have been very successful They are only withdrawn into one classroom for you know uh additional support and help but they move from one class to the other with the other children and that is a very commendable area in terms of integration and their achievement\n<$A> Is it because the visual impairment is comparatively easy to overcome than say the other impairments\n<$C> Yeah we are now talking about the mental ability The mentally handicapped child has got problems with some problems with mental ability and the child may suffer from other learning disability problems whereas if you have a visually handicapped child who has no other complications other than the vision then definitely his mental ability is capable of handling the academic work\n<$A> So it's easier for him to integrate\n<$C> Yes it's easier for him to integrate\n<$A> Yes", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> We have invited the director of Riuku Cultural Centre Dr Kinuthia Njoroge to come and talk to us about this interesting subject Welcome <ea/>Daktari\n<$B> <ea_>Asantesana <ea/>\n<$A> We would like you to start us off by telling us as somebody suggested just a few minutes ago Riuku Centre used to be famous several or some years ago When was it started and why was it started and how far has it gone to achieving its objectives\n<$B> Riuku Centre was first started in nineteen seventy-one by my late father who died in nineteen eighty-five and I took over for him in nineteen eighty-five and you probably know in nineteen eighty-six eighty-seven it was very very famous and unfortunately I got sick around ninety eighty-nine and I had to go for treatment in America but it was not actually sickness it was a matter of uh a connection between the traditional medicineman and the modernity was working whereby I was crowned as a traditional medicineman You can probably see some of the things that I'm having these items This item here is to symbolise the founder of our nation Taifa Baba Taifa you say Jomo Kenyatta This one is our present leader Honourable arap Moi Now this one is to say this one continues that is peace and tranquillity and development in the country in times of the cultural dissemination and also cultural promotion And Riuku Cultural Centre was set up basically for these to promote and disseminate African culture Now some of the aspirations is to set up a cultural centre at Land of Majito to cover the Luhya and the Luo culture\n<$A> That was your father's idea or your\n<$B> That was my father's idea In fact my father came to America to get me in nineteen seventy-one to come back here because after finishing my Masters I was very much involved with the Afro-American Centre So when I came back I told him we could start a similar centre here in Kenya to cater to the people of the African descent both from the American and also the people of African descent in this country whether they are Kenyans, Tanzanians, Zairians or even/ if they are Ethiopians so they can learn about our culture Now the aspiration of setting up uh one in Land of Majito or one in Digoland to cover the Giriama and the Digo or one in Akambaland uh around Kituye to cover the north-eastern people the Akamba and the north-eastern groups the uh uh say uh the Trokana the <O/> people and the <O/> actually to depict the Kikuyu and the Maasai The Kikuyus and the Maasai are very very close people as you probably know In fact the Kikuyu were dressed in the same way as the Maasai in the past\n<$A> How long ago was that\n<$B> That was only a hundred years ago hundred years ago and as you probably know the Maasai the name of Nairobi is a Maasai word meaning water and you can see the closeness of the Maasai land and the Kikuyu land You can see the closeness of the Kamba to the Kikuyu people The Kikuyu Embu and Meru people are one and the same If you take the Kalenjins and also the Meru have but one culture If you take the Miji Kenda are one cultural group\n<$A> Maybe during your studies you \n<$B> in America\n<$A> Yes you undertook research to find the similarities between the Maasais in the southern part of Kenya and the Samburu and the Pokot in the north-west part of Kenya What is their relationship\n<$B> I would like to correct you there a little bit The research was done here for the last twenty years It was done actually for fifteen years in the country When I came back as a Research Fellow at the University of Nairobi and also later on joined East African Airways the community you know the defunct community as international <O/> manager I was still very much interested in the ethnic cultural exchange between the different tribes of Kenya And still it was boiling in my head and still when my father started African cultural safaris at Hilton Hotel in Nairobi here to cater to the tourists to take them to the countryside to see the Maasai land in Ngong area around the Rift Valley to see the Kikuyland around the Central Rift uh Central Province to see the Wakamba around Kitui and the Kitui Hills which is very very rich These tours were conducted mainly for the tourists Later on we found even the schoolchildren are very much interested in this So when we set up Riuku Cultural Centre we started with oral narratives storytellers These are elderly people And this we have also approached the Minister of Culture and social services to make sure that if they can afford to give us a grant we can make it free for the school children who are leaders of tomorrow from Monday through Saturday and Sunday But now it is only free on Saturday and Sunday because we cannot afford to have it free for all the time For Kenya residents whether they are Asians or Europeans as long as they are Kenya residents they can come to the Riuku Cultural Centre from ten a m to ten p m We have shows at ten a m twelve p m and uh also four p m and eight p m If you come for the show at twelve p m and eight p m you have also to participate in what we call culinary acts Culinary acts is the different foods health foods health foods which are not affected by chemicals Say, <ea/>njahi if you compare <ea/>njahi and chips\n<$A> The traditional food\n<$B> The traditional food If you compare <ea/>njahi and chips there is no comparison because chips are just carbohydrates Now if you have <ea/>njahi it's almost like meat and it stays very long in the stomach If you have <ea/_>Mucheyu wamuiku<ea/> it is also very good Now instead of having something like <ea/>chai or coffee if you have soup you have <ea/>muteta is better because it's good for the bones You get that point\n<$A> Doctor\n<$B> Now wait a minute now doctors talk a lot now if you have\n<$A> But you have to go together We have to give us that we have to meet in a minute somewhere\n<$C> Now what I was wondering Doctor is the role of culture in development because you find that the path towards which we are moving is a path of development as defined by the current you know the trends to which we're moving and that if culture will kind of drag us back to where we came from I don't know how you can how you draw the line that divides culture and development as we are moving forwards\n<$B> Now that is a very good question You cannot separate culture and development because culture is the basis of our soul Take the particular instruments here called Gishandi Here you can find the roads of the travellers you can find houses of the men and houses of the women Music is a source of our soul and unless the people in Kenya understand music their traditions they cannot be able to develop because when the white men came in the country the colonists they tried to decolonize our minds so that you can follow their culture That's why you find I'm so very very happy and very grateful for the present president to make it a part of the eight four four programme whereby each and every student whether they are at the age of seven they are taking what you call oral literature and in our programme we have got oral performance and me myself I participate in what you call poetry or <ea/>marimeta in Gachaggi and it goes like this Take that particular song It says that I belong to Agashiku and my <ea/>muhiriga or my village all my clan is Bantonya And my <ea/>riga itself my circumcision is Mwangi And my father is called Maina I know my roots We must teach our students our children to know our roots Because if you are rootless then you don't know where you're going\n<$C> My point of argument <ea/>Daktari is that uh we learn these things and students will continue to be taught oral literature or whatever by somebody by their teachers I happen to have been a student of oral literature at one time but I don't see how it is contributing towards anything in towards my life People will be taught students will be taught but you don't understand \n<$B> You don't see it the right way But you see the song the music is a source of <O/> how you stand as a person how you behave in society whether you become a thief whether you become a nation-builder you understand The upbringing itself the roots the roots how your mother brings you how your grandmother brought you this is a source this is a source \n<$?> But when it comes to that as you know Dr Njoroge most of those people they're storytellers they are people okay they can do it they can compose songs without even going to a musical school \n<$B> That's right\n<$?> or musical class and these people are we can say most of them they are aged\n<$B> That's right\n<$?> How can we get you know teachers you know who will be teaching this wealth cultural wealth to the young generation\n<$?> The issue of \n<$?> Now let me answer you Njoroge Ph D I was not born was not bornRRR was not bornRRR a musician but I spent time with Karanje Wanduta who is <O/> I spent time with <name/> I spent time with uh <name/> from these are singers\n<$?> traditional singers\n<$?> traditional singers and from being with them eating with them with them <O/> with them like this pulling hairs like this with them I learned the act you see for our teachers if they are interested and they are devoted to culture if they feel it in their heart they can also become <O/> and they can continue their <O/> Now the other way we can continue for posterity's sake is by having these people filmed like I'm filmed and you can have a regional <O/> here <O/> which <O/> You can have a video cassette to the schools high schools and colleges you understand So that the schools can have these as apart of their programme Because the audience I'm speaking to some people would like to hear me but they are in the bars There are some students who are probably having their dinner now but would like to hear Dr Njoroge and what he has to say But if there is a video cassette for these things then the mass <O/> would be okay if it's possible for you to visit the Riuki Cultural Centre so that when we talk these things you can have a background of these things women pounding maize making the traditional the these things you make the fire You see\n<$C> In other words they can see a Kenyan or an African the way he used to live\n<$B> That's right And also to see his contribution in the modern technology the traditional technology\n<$C> And then you know it's important to have all these things but then since you interacted with those traditional story-tellers or composers\n<$B> And artists\n<$C> And artists Whatever you call them\nFrom your experience what was motivating them to compose songs or even to read poetry\n<$B> The thing that was motivating them is to put value systems strong enough so that our nation can be able to stand for posterity's sake so that we can stand up and say that we are a nation we are Kenyans we are not British we are not Americans You get my point You see Because we have got a soul we have got our roots we have got our culture\n<$A> Now Doctor you have been to be in the United States of America for a long time\n<$B> Sixteen years", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> uh the issue was that the world was polarised into two between uh on the one hand countries of the socialist world led by the Soviet Union and on the other Western uh countries led by the United States of America Uh the idea was that these countries needed economic assistance from both East and the West because they were poor and therefore they must not be seen aligned with either of the two major military blocks the NATO and the Warsaw Pact and if uh these countries had a relationship with either of the two super powers uh the relationship must not involve for example if they were in a military organisation a regional one must not involve a confrontation with another third power\n<$B> Dr Musonik uh that may be so but you realise also that uh critics have described the non-aligned movement as a movement of two blind people trying to lead each other I mean they have no budgets they have no programme of action They have no means of enforcing their decisions uh What is the actual justification of this movement then you know and now that uh you know the politics within which they were operating the bipolar politics are now no more uh how we justify the existence of a non-aligned movement\n<$A> Yah you must first note that it is indeed true to say uh it has no permanent structure uh or uh no headquarters for example You have rightly pointed out that it has no budget of its own uh but having said that you must realise that it has been addressing major issues one uh in the conferences of aids of states and government uh which take place now more or less on a regular basis every three years since nineteen seventy Secondly in the conferences of the ministers which take place even more frequently every one and a half years or so Thirdly within the frame of the United Nations uh where there is a group of the non-aligned countries that meets always on the eve of the opening of the general assembly of the United Nations and that there are also specialised agencies of the non-aligned movement uh suggests uh there is a an specialised agency on questions of economics which aligns it together with organisations like uh UNCTAD and within the frame of the struggle for the new international economic order So it is true that uh it doesn't function in the same manner as the United Nations but this is to be expected because the membership is heterogeneous in the extreme\n<$C> How do people who are poor uh people who are by and large dependent you know on aid for their own development become non-aligned Were these guys ever non-aligned\n<$A> Yes uh they were non-aligned in the sense uh that I'm described in the sense of not belonging to the military blocks and secondly they were non-aligned actually in the sense of trying to move away from being aligned to the former colonial powers that was the understanding of non-alignment\n<$B> yeah but with you must realise here that the organisation has been in existence for thirty-one years now if I'm right Now that's a long time in the lifetime of an organisation uh What would you say the movement will be remembered for after all those thirty-one years\n<$C> Tangible achievements\n<$A> First the movement will be remembered in the struggle for national liberation You must remember the year nineteen sixty is called the year of Africa but in many respects the majority of the African territories were colonial Uh there has been colonial domination of other areas of the world during this time Now thirty years later many of those countries are independent We can't always attribute this to the non-aligned movement It's uh a change actually in many ways but the question of the liberation movement and the liberation struggle is very important That is why for many years for example uh besides the independent countries being members there were also liberation movements that were members of the non-aligned movement including SWAPO of Namibia and the PLO uh of Palestine the Palestinian Liberation Organisation So that's the first area the liberation struggle and secondly the general uh struggle for peace universally uh to ensure the survival of humanity uh in the uh before the nuclear danger which has now began to subside but only in the last few years uh Then there has been the general struggle on the economic front which so far hasn't been very successful but the issues have been identified and that was why there was a call for the new international economic order for example and then uh there has been the struggle against domination in other fields including in the field of ideology in the field of culture and so on Uh that was embodied in the call for example for a new international information order Uh the non-aligned movement was involved in all these struggles \n<$?> but uh maybe uh to to interject on uh some of these uh order some of these calls or agendas that are developed over time we notice that issues like the new economic order the new international information order and all that were actually muzzled uh in almost nipped in the bud by withdrawal of financing for projects that used to be funded through UN agencies so in that case don't we see that uh even though they could have come up with very tangible very useful agendas that actually they were too unable actually to deliver\n<$A> yeah I mean that it is it is important that these issues be identified It's important that they be addressed The fact that there continues to be domination and especially from one major power in the world today does not mean that the agenda will not be made to address and identify decisions I think that is the most important thing\n$C/D: Now given that we uh can no longer take a middle road because there is no communism or there is no eastern block uh there is no uh Okay there is the west but it is a uni-polar world now uh where are we going to stand still maintain that middle road What are we going to do now\n<$A> in fact now more than ever there is a need for the non-aligned movement meaning that we are not allied to the dominant uni-polar power that we have in mind uh because it has become clear uh with the collapse of the Soviet Union and especially the Eastern world in general except for one or two countries now that the issues that the non-aligned movement sought to address from the beginning have become even acute that is the struggle against domination the struggle against hegemonism on the part of uh super-powers the struggle against dictation or dictatorship if you like uh Second the importance of the non-aligned movement lies precisely in the understanding that these countries constitute the majority of the world and that if they were to co-operate among themselves they could do much better than they have been doing in the past so that the call for the so-called north-south uh dialogue becomes even more acute now because all the countries of the north are really in one camp today\n<$B> Dr Musonik uh just a follow-up on that question uh we realise that the issues right now facing the world have to do with economics Uh most parts of the worlds most regions of the world are moving towards more economic regionalization and us here in the Third World we are stuck with uh issues such as debt crisis you know commodity price fluctuations poverty and and mental degradation We have started programmes like south-south-co-operation but in fact they don't work unless there's uh a substantial amount of goodwill from the from the west and you know and all these things Don't we think perhaps it's time the you know the members of the non-aligned movement should shift the agenda from the political side more to the economics\n<$A> yah and in fact that is precisely the agenda now because for example we mentioned the liberation struggle and it is very clear that as far as Africa is concerned that is almost a closed chapter and the same is true of many other parts of the world uh It is true that it is economic issues that are paramount and that is why the suggestion made by our president when he was in Jakarta that we must uh uh create a permanent mechanism a permanent structure for uh trying to resolve these problems uh becomes very relevant and the problems are the problems with poverty problems of economics therefore but there are also the problems of conflicts which are taking place they are becoming even more acute now than before\n<$C> the as the US is the dominant power uh on the globe right now do we not you know run the danger of coming into conflict with it every now and then uh especially because there is a fear that uh uh Washington might want to be you know the global policeman Do we have uh resources and the will to take on Washington say no wait a minute we do not want this\n<$A> yah we must we must not accept you know uh domination as a matter of principle and there is no reason for this kind of pessimism just uh because if the United States for example is the major the only power right now and I think the situation in many ways was even worse during colonial times when the people of one colonial territory were under an imperial power that was extremely powerful Uh having said that it is true to say that the United States is extremely powerful and the only way to cope with it even approximately or remotely is precisely the way of collective action and that is what the non-aligned movement's about\n<$C> now uh that's very interesting because uh one of course the dollar is almost the currency of the world now and uh when we want to discuss uh uh economic co-operation let's say between Mali and uh Somalia I mean we are really talking in terms of the dollar and therefore the our reference point is still that same policeman of the world Uh don't you think that uh perhaps a different approach or even uh an acceptance uh that really uh it'll continue forever to be an ideal that must not be realised to say that this is possible for these poor too many poor countries to uh to mobilise their uh collective action together\n<$A> uh it seems to be sometimes we have a problem of lack of imagination uh Why must we use the dollar for example in exchange between Kenya and Mali Why didn't we exchange our commodities directly I'm not an economist but there is such a possibility I need I think we need a more imaginative approach\n<$B> Now uh I'm not so sure that uh the non-aligned movement has played a substantial a substantive role in solving conflicts among warring uh fractions or uh internal fractions within member countries uh Africa has is just now emerging from uh several decades of internal  strife and presently in Angola and Mozambique we are seeing now movement towards peace and in Indochina also we are seeing this movement and I'm not so sure that uh you know non-aligned movement has played this role It has more often left the role to the United Nations you know to bring about peace in these areas uh in its manifesto Is there any clause you know whereby it is a it gives itself a role to play in solving in the solving conflicts among the various warring fractions in member countries \n<$A> uh I think we pointed out already that it actually does not have a charter so there is no place we can read uh which says that it should play that kind of role But uh even the United Nations as a body if it were to play this role uh it would play the role influenced by certain forces within it uh We have said already that the non-aligned countries constitute the majority of the members of the United Nations If uh they were given the opportunity to do this and part uh one of their calls they made in Jakarta was the veto-power of the five permanent members of the Security Council should be removed because it is

{'text': "<$A> as a result of the general uh development throughout the world computers coming together with telecommunications uh a new type of services are now beginning to appear on the horizon We are aware that for some we now have extensive use of faxing service here Previously this service wasn't available And in fact we are at the moment market-driven because the demand for that kind of service is there Therefore people want to use them they want to be modern\n<$B> But surely information is a very sensitive area How would you ensure that uh supposing I wanted to talk uh to somebody in Mombassa how do you ensure that the destination of my information it's ensured and whatever secrets I may want to pass on are not heard by somebody else\n<$A> Yes uh there is uh what we provide is generally secure type of facility Just like for example when you said of your telephone call between say Nairobi and Mombassa uh you get access to your call customer and you can communicate Similarly what we have with the Kenfax System is that there will be what we call handshaking arrangements which provide what we call security checks uh so that you know that you have actually accessed the right point So all this has been built and uh we are building on uh experience of quite a number of other people\n<$C> But maybe uh just to add on that Mr Chemai I think uh when once in a while you may dial uh your number and then your finger slips and uh will touch a wrong button Now in this case uh I might press the wrong button and I access uh some sensitive uh data somewhere that should actually uh be supposedly uh limited in terms of circulation How do you ensure that there's no tapping because that's a possibility\n<$A> That's a very good question What happens is any database throughout the world uh be it in the UK US or anywhere if a subscriber entered into that database the first thing that you you'd be required to provide is your own secret code which would be known to you individually because you are a subscriber to that database You will therefore be asked by the host computer Who are you And you will have to insert your code You say I'm so and so and so And once the computer recognises you're talking now of the receiving computer and not the computer communicating Once it's recognised that that secret code then the receiving computer will allow you to access its memory or its database Now if for example a stray call is coming in then that that stray call will not have that access code that you <O/> enter into that database And these are all built in uh so as to protect the databases\n<$D> A fundamental question to Mr Omondi I do not uh really it comes to we have this query you know in new services like this do you have to lay uh new lines for that communication or do you use already existing cables\n<$C> What we do we integrate we look into what is already existing We ask ourselves on what is already existing can we enhance it to incorporate the new service If we can we do If we cannot then we say to ourselves what more do we need in order that a new service can be laid and then we do that\n<$B> Mr Omondi\n<$C> Yeah\n<$B> I think it's very apparent that this is not really a very new service What you already use like maybe the use of telegrams or maybe is it telegrams or telegraphs or maybe the computers In fact you can improve on them and get the same thing uh the same success that you expect to get from these So why don't you improve on what you already have rather than go and launch a new service which end up having <O/> and make the organisation have so many  services which may not be as efficient as they would be had it been only one type of service\n<$C> Uh we in KPTC we are the servants of the people We are not masters What we do is what the people wants us to do So the Kenyan population plus the world demands at this point in time that we introduce Kenya packet switching service And in fact the demand for it the pressure the need the benefit that it's going to do to us is such that had we been able to do it earlier we would have Therefore Kenya packet switching system is not going to introduce any inefficiency in us at all To the contrary it is going to relieve us of the burden of what we used to have of processing point to point things which are inefficient and very expensive and people are complaining to give us a cost-effective efficient service that is going to help very much\n<$B> But you see even when you want this speed post service for instance you know you promise a lot of efficiency a lot of everything but today send a packet it takes so many days to reach if it ever reaches that is so really people may not welcome even this new service as they would because already what you have launched before hasn't lived to their expectation So really how are you dispersing this fear in them\n<$B> So what have you done that wasn't there that made the other services fail or not live to the expectations What have you improved on could you just give an outline\n<$C> I am not accepting there is an assumption there that our services are inefficient that they are not working how will Kenfax work You know that is the query I'm not accepting that our services are inefficient The mere fact that at this point in time in our development the mere fact that we may not have achieved one hundred per cent efficiency wouldn't be correct criteria for saying our services have not been efficient So it is rather very difficult for me to answer what have we done to Kenfax which will we make it efficient when all our services are inefficient \n<$D> I learn that uh there is another uh development uh there is another new service that is being introduced uh before I query uh I don't like boasting about the uh this other service uh called mobile telephone uh maybe I would just throw uh I put forward a question about uh I think I read someplace that uh some crooks actually used uh this transfer system Uh someplace it will transfer funds uh in some banks So maybe you if you may you may choose to respond you may not choose to respond But uh if uh I gathered that information and uh one begins to think about uh those possibilities People hear all these wizards uh going around with uh codes But uh my query is about the mobile telephone for now I think one may be hearing that uh KPTC is coming up with the mobile telephone Uh What's the technology behind it and when does it come into operation I think Mr Chemai that you might uh address yourself to that\n<$A> You asked two questions \n<$D> Yes\n<$A> First of all the fraudulent transfer of funds uh You know we live in an environment which is fairly common throughout the world There are crooks There are people who are *unsocial> They'll use anything They'll either use the electronic means to transfer funds They'll forge a cheque They will even print money So this is the society that we live in and every technology tries to circumvent and to quit this Kenfax itself is a service that facilitates the transfer of information PNT is not in the business of securing uh funds and transfer funds That is left to the owner of the banking institution that runs the banks here Now uh coming to this question of the mobile service The mobile service yes is a service that we have uh we're in the process of launching The equipment is already within the country and shortly installation will commence uh We expect this service to be introduced next early next year uh The It's a service which will cater for a again special group within the community people who do not want to be out of telephone contact at any one time We have businessmen who when they are travelling between Nairobi to Mombassa they want to know what is happening in their factory they want to have to know what is happening they want to prepare meetings and so on That is going to cater for those people\n<$B>communication <O/> to the introducing time for local codes How is this going to work and why was it not done before\n<$A> Uh the reason why it was not there before In order to do uh accurate timing you need proper equipment And in the past the type of exchanges that we had were not very suitable for carrying out automatically the local call timing As technology improved and as we have improved in our network very much we then have on a widespread basis excellent equipment that can be able to do this job and the reason why it needs to be done is to allow proper use of the facilities that we have so that everybody can be able to use The public has been telling us look why don't you do something about this local call Why do you allow it to be one metre pulse for the whole day and if you can misuse the equipment which we don't need and others then cannot get to them why don't you do it in a manner that people can pay for only what they need which will be in multiples of every three minutes So the reason for doing it is efficiency in the use of a network and it is going to result in uh more people being able to get their calls through\n<$B> Mr Omondi don't you think it's just another way of the post office trying to get more money\n<$C> No The aim of the post office has never been at any point in time to get more money No The aim of the post office has always been to provide services as efficiently as possible and as economically as possible That has always been the aim of a post office\n<$D> But uh the uh for this local uh call timing uh will definitely resulting in the uh uh the consumer or the client paying a little bit more uh definitely\n<$C> What will happen is the consumer first of all will use only the time that he needs to use and pay for that time There is nothing like paying a little more You're just using the time you need using it as well as you would and paying for it For example the local calls from Nairobi to Nairobi What would happen is as it's supposed to be When you're going to communicate in a phone you have to think of what you are going to communicate and communicate it And when you finish communicating it you put down your receiver so that other people can use it but this is heavily influenced by what you are going to pay If you are going to pay one metre pulse for one day then it encourages you to hold onto the lines and other people are screaming So there is no paying little more It is paying for what you are using\n<$B> But in this case the consumer knows what he wants or she wants If really I'm going to make a call I don't want to go and say and how long I'm going to take and if I've been doing that even with one shilling and fifty cents for the whole day really it means then there wasn't there was nothing much I was going to do on that day", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '07b0931f-d5c7-4f38-9be7-8b36fffb4691', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.067460+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': "<$A> There are people who have blamed the police department for issuing licences to people whom are not uh are not uh competent in driving And uh they say this is one reason as to why the accidents Can you tell us uh how one gets a licence through what procedure and what else he goes\n<$B> Yes according to the procedures held when one wants a driving licence he must have attained an age of eighteen years and above And he should have his eyes proper and he should have ears proper should have physical fit body physical fit So if one wants to get this licence this first of all he must have those qualities and then he should also attend school uh driving-schools to get knowledge of how he can be able to drive When he attends or he finishes those lessons as the subject he is going to take then he can apply to be tested at our headquarters uh Oraka But there is no way one can obtain a driving licence if he does not qualify for all those things I've mentioned\n<$A> And uh during that test what aspects do you look into\n<$B> Yes if one goes for testing first of all he should be aware of all road signs including rules He should be able to show that he knows how to drive the vehicle itself If he doesn't know how to drive or driving uh vehicle <O/> he'll fail Now from the view of he himself or herself will say oh I failed it because uh they're not uh really letting me to pass this exam but it's due to his own fault or her own fault otherwise he should have all qualities before he passes the exam\n<$A> And uh when you test a person for the PSV licence what aspects do you check because I believe when carrying passengers you should really emphasise the importance of knowing how to drive very well\n<$B> At the moment uh one must have attained uh an experience of four and above an experience four years and above At the same time he should be clean in his record He is not to have been charged for causing death or having committed a serious offence Then before he is given that PSV uh uh licence he should also produce a certificate of good conduct and then from that point uh he'll be considered \n<$A> If I learnt physics thirty years ago and definitely I want to carry out a project which I'll need my physics I have to go for a refresher course For someone who has learnt driving thirty years ago he'll need a refresher course Do you have do you examine some of the drivers after some time to see that they are still competent\n<$B> No it's only if somebody is holding an international driving licence when he was somewhere in abroad and he wants to get a Kenya driving licence he can apply the same methods done and then he can be re-tested From that point he can be issued with the driving licence for this country\n<$A> There are some places where drivers are not supposed to hoot especially near hospitals But you find that some of the drivers ignore this What action do you take\n<$B> Surely this does show a place our police have searched in every corner If uh a place where there is a sign showing that a driver is not supposed to hoot you'll find our police officers actively perform their duties there And other places like uh well you've mentioned hostels schools and all other places specified by the authority where hooting is not allowed you'll find our police officers there performing their duties\n<$A> Recently there have been complaints in newspapers that some of the things which you will find in <ea/>matatus like the music systems they're really a bother to the passengers Has any action been taken to see that the music is really out because the rule was there but then it seems it has been forgotten\n<$B> Now surely I've been very much active on this issue Well the music system which uh  equipments<>+_equipment> fitted in these <ea/>matatus are causing a lot of hazards You know if the music <O/>is on and the driver is driving uh he'll not have to concentrate on driving otherwise he'll be disturbed he'll be disturbed by the music Once again the communication between the passengers and the maybe the conductor or the driver in case a passenger wanted to alight it becomes very difficult He shouts or she shouts Nobody hears So we don't want to hear this kind of music uh being played in these <ea/>matatus for so many reasons apart of what I've said\n<$A> When these <ea/matatu drivers and the touts are right in town they switch off the music but once they get out of town they start playing it Is there no way which the traffic department can get them out of town\n<$B> Yeah these are clever lions I've learnt a lot of things from these <ea/>matatus you know They all have this music played outside of the city centre but still we're always alert Sometimes we mount this operation and then we arrest a few who are still who are still having this uh uh music system in their <ea/>matatus\n<$A> And first aid boxes are very important especially in PSV vehicles but I tend to think that in many <ea/>matatus these facilities are lacking Is the traffic department trying to do something about it\n<$B> Yes surely we are trying to put uh an effort into this and every PSV vehicle should have that item first aid uh uh kit-box because in any case an accident occurs definitely for those people who know how to first aid their victim definitely will benefit from the uh uh from that kit if there are some items whereby a victim can be given a first aid So we'll be trying hard to find out from all these <ea/>matatus and other local buses In any case we find a driver has not got one then he has got to answer for that\n<$A> What happened uh with the speed governor It was supposed to be introduced and working on our roads But so far we haven't heard much about it\n<$B> Thank you very much I think this subject we can little bit put it off at the moment otherwise it's still under study So maybe in the near future you'll have this thing done otherwise at the moment uh the authority's still looking into this matter\n<$A> Alcohol can play a major part when it comes to road accidents because people lose their minds and they forget that they're using the roads which so many people are using Yet we'll find that especially weekends some people go with their cars somewhere and they start drinking and yet we have police officers and they know very well after drinking these people are going to drive Is there no action which can be taken\n<$B> Surely we have been taking action every now and then Otherwise the problem we have in this uh city is that the outskirts drivers tend to be clever enough They go they park their vehicles far away from uh the bars they drink but still when they come across where we amount our operations they get into a trap So we are busy looking into this and we are insisting in fact we are appealing to remember the public not to drive the vehicles when they have taken some drinks or drugs\n<$A> Corporal <O/> you see on our major highways the traffic police they stop a vehicle and then after a while the vehicle leaves You wonder what they are checking What do you check especially when you stop a vehicle\n$3 Normally a police officer has got to go into that vehicle to check the capacity of the passengers who have fitted into that vehicle At the same time he has got a right to ask any complaint from members of public who are seated in that vehicle At the same time to check the documents in respect to the same vehicle plus other documents for the driver and the <ea/>makangas If they're all good then the vehicle can be released But if somebody has uh loaded the passengers in a in a in a big capacity then the driver will be charged for overloading\n<$A> But do you look at the mechanical aspects of the vehicle because I see someone just goes round the car and don't test the brakes\n<$B> No we don't do that The only things we check about uh tyres something like that lights possible but normally we don't go around like a mechanics No we don't do so\n<$A> And uh the public vehicles usually you'll find that they're overcrowded at times especially like during Christmas time And I feel sometimes uh the people are not reduced okay the vehicle has been stopped But then the people do not alight Isn't this one way of causing road accidents I should think some people should be told to alight\n<$B> Of course if you have been travelling last Christmas or last year's Christmas you have found that uh police officers were busy trying to help members of public Our main uh aim is to make sure that the accidents are reducing but we are not there to ask people to <O/> for that offence no We are there to educate members of public including the drivers themselves If we find a vehicle to be overcrowded it is our duty to ask these members of public politely to get off from this vehicle to wait for another vehicle\n<$A> Pedestrians and uh here I like to emphasise especially in Nairobi they're usually not respected by motorists You see there is a zebra crossing but there is a vehicle coming so fast and they're not respecting that zebra crossing What action is usually taken against such drivers\n<$B> Fine so far in every place where there's a zebra crossing you find some police officers We are there to help members of public young ones aged ones to cross safely At the same time also we are appealing to members of public let them be aware of these vehicles They've got also the right of the way If a policeman holds a hand to stop vehicles that is their time to cross across the road But sometimes we get other problems like an old <ea/>mama comes to that place She stands and then she watches you what you are doing Now by the time you allow vehicles to pass you'll find that mama trying to pass just running across which is wrong So we're there daily to assist members of public\n<$A> Do you work together with engineers who are in charge of roads because you'll find at times there is a zebra crossing and I tend to feel that some of these zebra crossings are not at the right position or the traffic lights\n<$B> Fair enough We are asking members of public wherever it comes across anything which is not proper and if there's a way which isn't proper they can inform uh police officers especially traffic department They can go and talk to the engineers and then they rectify it Meanwhile we have got our senior officer He's Mr Munyalo Superintendent of police He is in charge of this section that is research and planning In any case there's a complaint of maybe uh maybe <O/> a building was built at a place which is not supposed or something was done by an engineer who was not aware You can just talk to these people and then something can be done\n<$A> At times the traffic lights they'll show the cars that they can move it's green And then for the pedestrians it's green Who is to blame\n<$B> Well this is a fault of computer sometimes You know uh machines are machines They are bound to either be correct or wrong So we there is no one to blame otherwise we can now talk of computers Sometimes it is not in a proper condition you'll find that the light given is green for a pedestrian to cross at the same time the other side it is green for a motorist to cross", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '40c548e2-9f59-46e8-85de-c8678bd23dbd', 'added':

{'text': "<$A> You could perhaps tell the viewers certain precise ideas that that uh led to the kind of mobilisation strategies What were some of the specific objectives that women hoped to achieve uh Were they simply jumping onto the bandwagon because there was an election fever round the corner uh Did they really plan for what they were supposed to uh expect to achieve in the long term Was how specific were some of the plans that went into that euphoria\n<$B> Yeah I think that's a good question uh It was definitely not euphoria uh What I would say it was part and parcel of what the rest of the Kenyan society was being Again you'll remember this was the first time in Kenya that we had multi-party election and all of us were expecting change uh within a multi-party democratic system the kind of change that people had been looking forward to for thirteen years including women And women saw an opportunity which they seized to achieve what they had failed to achieve during earlier struggles since nineteen uh sixty-three uh during this current period in uh after the repeal of section two uh of the constitution Their major objective of course very short term was the politic in parliament as you said in the beginning getting as many women as possible into decision-making bodies into parliament into civic positions Of course we'd the precise intention objective of using that platform to be able to advance and lobby for all the other issues that affect the status of women the human rights of women\n<$A>in positions of leadership in especially in positions of political leadership That is the precise point I'm making And therefore the noise that was made during that electioneering process seems to have been uh a strategy perhaps placed in place by uh certain men in society certain political figures in society uh to have the women uh do what they expected them to do In other words I do not think that the women actually <O/> planned and insured that a certain process was going to be in place for them to achieve certain political positions because I think at the end of the election uh uh campaign what transpired was that women came up in arms and they said they had been given a slap in the face They were disillusioned by the results of the uh of the election uh process And yet judging by what went during the election process one would have expected that uh all that noise all that euphoria all that mobilisation should really have given certain concrete results for women\n<$B> Uh Mr <name/> I want to disagree with you about the noise We women were not making noise and I think using that concept is an insult to the women of Kenya \n<$A> Well I think the concept \n<$B> Now I may think <O/> noise women did not make noise \n<$A> the concept of noise Dr Mariondon is one that is an acceptable concept in uh a normal electioneering process\n<$B> What they did\n<$A> Noise is uh in this context something that uh men made men still make a lot of noise about elections today the word over So I don't use the word noise in uh uh a *derogative> sense I'm talking about the general atmosphere\n<$B> I hope not I hope not But I wanted to clear that issue because I know there are women there as viewers who when they heard you use that concept they were offended\n<$A> Well the men wouldn't be offended if I said men make a lot of noise\n<$B> Men talk a lot of women just making empty noise meaning that they just talk but they don't mean a word they say Let me tell you something Last year women meant everything they did And let me tell you somebody who participated directly in the process We spent sleepless night strategizing planning and there was not a single man there telling us what to do We were designing our own plans as women of this country We were fed up with being led by the nose by men And we're saying we have to take the bull by the horns That's what we were saying <O/> last year \n<$A> Well how far did you take the bull\n<$B> We did we did\n<$A> Just how far <O/>\n<$A> We took it we took it to the elections and I already told you the figures that women had as they approached the election despite all the problems they encountered through the electoral process what then happened and this is the point I was about to make before you brought me back after the elections is that the modest achievement they made which everything considered can even be said to be good achievement by getting six women into parliament before we have only had an average of two women in parliament And I would say this was purely through the efforts of women themselves not anything handed down to them by the men of this country and\n<$A> Wouldn't you think perhaps uh uh uh wouldn't you want to comment on the fact that perhaps behind every woman who took part in this uh uh election process with due respect to the women who did that there was a man behind them \n<$B> No there was no man behind them except perhaps if you're talking about spouses who had for the first time to find how uh uh you know wives coming home a bit late because we were busy planning and strategizing some where\n<$A> Doesn't that this then bring us back to the issue of uh the status of women uh uh as women and the status of men as men What is your view of uh the Kenyan woman Is she a different type of woman because the world over we get the impression that uh men will always be men and by extension women will always be women and uh the historical facts bear out the fact that uh men apparently lead the world Women support men in positions of leadership What is your view on that\n<$B> My view is that that may be the current reality in terms of numbers in terms of percentages particularly in the political arena It's true that if you look at uh the world's the global cabinets you'll find probably on the average about three percent women uh If you look at how many women are prime ministers or presidents of various countries they're a handful That is a fact and it has a lot to do with a lot of historical uh events you know over time that has led to a situation where man has been uh in a sense seen by society as the one who should provide leadership particularly political leadership and it has all to do with you know in a very basic sense to do with our socialisation both men and women their so-called social-cultural uh upbringings\n<$A> It goes beyond it goes beyond Dr Marionsomo <O/>\n<$B> No It doesn't No it doesn't\n<$A> It goes beyond the It goes beyond the socialising\n<$B> Let me finish me finishRRR I'll tell you what I think\n<$A> I just wanted to make a comment\n<$B> It's not biological You talk about you know uh uh these problems are uh not biological\n<$A> Yes they're not biological factor <O/>\n<$B>The only thing that is biological about the relationship the gender relations is the fact that you are born a man a man who cannot perhaps bear children yah uh because nature did not give you the ability to bear children But you contribute to the bearing of children But the person who has not only to contribute to the bearing of the children but also perhaps who carried the child for nine months is the woman That's perhaps the only difference and that is not a difference that should not make that you know major difference in terms of what you and me can do in future life you know beyond uh the reproductive activities if one may call may call them that So the point I'm making is what happens thereafter that creates barriers for women to advance particularly in certain areas like politics has a lot to do with socio-cultural conditioning You are conditioned from the time you are born as a baby and the time I was born as a baby to see yourself as somebody with socially designed roles that you must play and you're almost told that it is God-given although it is not God-given\n<$A> Well the the spiritual fact is that it is God-given I mean don't you believe in the myth of creation \n<$B> I don't I don't believe in myths\n<$A> That Adam was created before Eve was created Do you believe it \n<$B> I don't believe in myths and I with all due respect to God and I have a lot of respect in God I don't believe in those myths\n<$A> Perhaps the that the woman who is an exceptional uh leader is really the exception to the rule that the majority of the women are indeed content to be led by men\n<$B> No I think there is nothing exceptional about the women who lead All that is exceptional is that perhaps certain you know circumstances within her own upbringing did not fit within the mould within which some of us have been socialised that perhaps her parents had brought her through those you know socio-cultural myths about gender roles and they trained their daughter from very uh very young age to think differently which in itself goes back to say if we retrain or if we start the process of resocializing ourselves and our children differently there would be no reason in the world why men and women should not share all roles decision-making or otherwise except perhaps for the bear you know the carrying of a child for nine months \n<$A> Are you then advocating uh a sort of equality between men and women\n<$B> I am advocating equity \n<$A> You're advocating equity\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> But uh what then makes the difference between advocating equity and advocating equality Perhaps the few the viewers would want to bring out the differences\n<$B> I think equality assumes that you know everything has to sort of be measured you know you almost put everything on weights and balance it and you have to measure every little you know uh ounce to make sure that there is complete equality okay Equity on the other hand you know brings the concept of justice you know in terms of sharing roles That for example if you are in the kitchen cooking and I'm in the sitting room supervising uh the homework of the child we don't argue over whether the kitchen you know work you're doing at the same time I'm doing the supervision is uh the equal to the one I'm you know you're doing in the kitchen In other words it's a it's a question of having a proper understanding where one person does not you know overly suppress the other\n<$A> You are a very very uh uh uh you are in a position of leadership \n<$B> yes\n<$A>You're an international figure uh You teach at the university You teach men you teach women \n<$B>\n<$A> Therefore you have achieved a certain status in society Have you had any obstacles Have you had any direct confrontations from the Kenyan man challenging your role your status as a woman in that kind of position of leadership \n<$B> I would say\n<$A> To hear you talk\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> To hear the majority of the women in the country to talk about equity uh vis-à-vis equality one would begin to think that uh men have actually shut doors in women's faces My question then is where were the women when men were shutting these doors You're talking about the socialisation process as having uh uh made women what they are made men what they are \n<$B> \n<$A> I quoted earlier that the Bible the spiritual process has also made women subservient to men \n<$B>\n<$A> But in your experience have you really encountered I know of cases but I would like to hear from you Have you encountered sexist uh attitudes uh in this country Have you encountered sexist attitudes elsewhere\n<$B> Personally \n<$A> Yes yes you personally\n<$B> Oh yes oh yes I get them all the time uh You uh I can be at a meeting the lone woman in the

{'text': "<$A> Now you have seen in previous programmes and those of you who may not have had the opportunity of seeing them they should know where we are We started with the life of a baby inside the womb of uh of his mother Then we went through the stage of delivering that baby We had appropriate experts on that area to give the professional view uh there and we went on to the child in its early stages when we had also an expert in that area and then we have looked at the issues that uh are going to help a mother cope with not only having the pregnancy but also delivering the baby and also uh be able to look after that baby better identifying areas of possible trouble which may render such a child vulnerable to stress-related problems later in life We have looked at also parentage as an issue from uh day one all the way to year twelve of age and here again we have had different experts to look at the bio-physiological development aspect to look at the relationship of parent-child and how they differ I mean how what they contribute in this area and so on So that we have looked at this issue uh uh up to age twelve and many of you are already aware of this and I need not go back to all the things that we have said Right now we have reached a stage where we want to introduce the next stage which is very important namely the teenage\n<$B> Thank you now when you talk of the teenage age or the teenagers as the terminology may be used to describe a certain group of people I believe the areas that must be defined is the relationship that is where they're similar where there par between puberty and adolescence Now if you may just enunciate that further\n<$A> yes I think uh there is a uh an *interbetween> position between the adolescence and the childhood and that is the stage we call puberty and it starts with the physical changes that we see in a child uh such as rapid development of the body both in terms of height and also girth and other dimensions We also see the developmental things in the body that were not there before such as breasts uh beard the voice of a boy breaks and if he was singing alto uh or uh like that he may need now to move on to bass or things like this And there are those changes they also <O/> to develop pimples on their face all these changes rapid growth and the others I've mentioned uh that stage when this is occurring that is what we call puberty Now it is a biophysiological change really mainly seen in the body and that introduces adolescence and adolescence is a stage where you have uh now hypersocial changes and they take new meaning and greater prominence uh in the child uh or or <O/> the young persons Now that is the difference between them one embraces the hypersocial area of change the other the physical area of change\n<$B> Do both of these constitute the teenage age or where does that come in? If you maybe define that\n<$A> Well teenage really traditionally has been defined as age thirteen to say eighteen or there about Uh for us <O/>you may say from you know some of them they can start a bit earlier like twelve the early bird and age nineteen the later ones But mainly from thirteen to about eighteen traditionally but the term teenager does not cover all of adolescence at all It is kind of time related to <O/> But we now know that adolescence as such goes far beyond what we traditionally call teenage so that some of the research coming out even from this country are now showing that uh adolescence is on all the way up to age twenty-four So we can say adolescence as such uh starts with the oncoming of uh puberty but then goes on mushrooming and being much more serious say between age fifteen uh and uh fourteen and eighteen that's the peak But then we do see some <O/> struggling with what is and still could be adolescence even into the early twenties all the way up to twenty-four\n<$B> So without wanting to jump the gun so of speak and get into may be what could be the next stage somewhat on the programme that is adulthood when you hear the term adulthood by law I think it's about eighteen years or twenty-one depending on some countries Does that imply that the term adolescence one can be in the adolescent stage yet be a young adult or does adolescence simply refer to what you call maturity or maturing of the body\n<$A> Well the legal definition of maturation differs uh from some other definitions of maturation and I think that the legal age eighteen is okay we accept that as stated by the constitution but you do have very many people who have not finished with their business of growing up by age eighteen Legally they are adults entitled to vote have one vote as adult in law entitled to get married uh uh and only respectfully inform parents about it because they are adults and that kind of thing but we now know that very many of these legal adults are not in terms of human maturation parameters uh adults yet because they are still struggling in coping with the problems of adolescence although legally they are adults You are right therefore that there is a difference between the two\n<$B> now if we may go back to the puberty stage that is why you mentioned that there is the biophysiological change within the body What kind of changes are we talking of if you may look at specifics the kind of education that you may have or that go with it by the individual concerned because all along as you've grown up you've been able to have questions answered and some of these changes will occur within and the person so to speak will choose to contain them within himself or herself feeling that by letting it out then there is some <O/> on his or her part not quite understanding that it's all in the courses of change \n<$A> yes that is important to understand Well I think one frightening change is that very rapid growth of the body I remember one boy who asked his father When am I going to stop daddy when am I going to stop growing up He was so worried that he was already six feet and he was uh fifteen year I mean sort of odd thing <O/> he was six feet up and he was <O/> sixteen year and he thought that this is terrible and uh he was very very worried We have seen that in boys we have seen that in girls There are girls of fifteen who look twice the size of their mothers sometimes and uh because of various biological reasons why that happened Now when you have a rapid bodily growth this worries the wearer of this body They don't think it's going to stop and they're worried that it will go on and on and on and on so they become very very anxious and they're asking questions like that there are other who are worried by the development for example of beard and rough face and a broken voice These things uh do not conjure a picture of beauty and handsomeness in a young man and they are worried that that they're getting worse and not better in terms of beauty and so on and this worries them so that you see anxiety and worry about these physical changes They are normal completely In girls you have development of breasts and many of them again uh well subconsciously they look forward to them, when they finally come they don't like them so much uh but worse than the breasts is when the period the monthly period comes for the first time It's one of these physical changes <O/> and that worries them very much so that the emotional maturation of these children is not where it should be to be able to understand and accommodate this The intellectual maturity is not <O/> yet to be able to understand them that is why programmes like this help them know that these are normal changes They are going to grow according to the way God has programmed when they are going to stop and there'll be no problems at all but the anxieties and worries that go with them we should appreciate as adults and help them where we can\n<$B> so these changes are there and they will take place in any normal growing person What of the social acceptance that is one can understand that the parents or the adults who are there within that environment should help the children get to understand and accept this as part and parcel of growing up What of the when I mentioned the social acceptance within the field I'm imagining you may have such situations where the children are now going to school yet relatively others want them to be maturing and growing up faster compared to the others and with children they are always teasing each other back and forth then you shouldn't belong to our class you're not one of us so you are an old man and so on How do you get to relate to them\n<$A> Human beings look at the size of the body and they decide that the ones who are little are children the bodies that are big belong to adults that is the first major area of trouble because at family level when a young man that is a boy grows up to say five feet eight nearly six feet and he is only sixteen adults in that family father mother and others see a big bodied individual and they conclude that this is an adult and therefore they expect out of them behaviour appropriate to an adult He is not an adult yet he is only a child but with a body that looks like that of an adult In fact this is important to remember because this is described a lot in literature that the body reaches adult size about the age I've just mentioned uh but the intelligence is somewhere in-between adult and say a child They are in high-school and they are able to do quite complicated intellectual uh calculations and so on but emotionally they are even younger still than that so you see a person who is carrying a body of an adult an intelligence halfway between if you like and an emotional apparatus of a child that's right for the emotional apparatus by that age may not even more than say age uh thirteen or fourteen or that kind of thing although the person may be sixteen so in fact if you look at that now you see a person who is in chaos Body of an adult intelligence half way between if you like and then emotions of a child in one and the same person That disconnection of the individual in his personality unity so to speak is causes a lot of difficulty for the teenager and this is referred to as adolescent turmoil Here is refers to the kind of chaos and the feelings of uh fear and uh the and <O/> all that that occur around this sort of time as the puberty enters and <O/> adolescence and there is a grey area between them and it's not that puberty stops here adolescence starts there This area the psychology of it physiology of itRRR uh and of course the physical dimensions I just mentioned that is causing a lot of trouble so what I'm trying to say therefore is that when you see people with these big bodies ask them their age If they are only fifteen sixteen then or even thirteen they are not yet mature enough to be expected to perform as if they were already fully mature", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '71fb07ae-431b-460b-a59b-81a8a7465669', 'added':

{'text': "<$A> Child Survival is a programme highlighting the plight of children all over the world The growing cases of child abuse and neglect the need to observe the rights of the child his health and the general care of the child\n<$C> Participation the right to participation is a dynamic and to all rights of children And this is embedded in the UN convention on the rights of the child which makes provision for the right to participation In articles in the following articles you have the right to expression freedom of thought and conscience freedom of association protection from interference with privacy protection of children of minorities with the indigenous people Uh participation might mean that children have a right to be a part of to take part in and to be heard on issues affecting them They have a right to freedom of expression and I say matters that affect their lives Uh children also have a right to association with other children to play join clubs and this is a way that they can develop their talents\n<$B> Now people might uh misunderstand this meaning of the children having the right to participation Some of them in fact I've heard of them saying that maybe once we talk of the children's right to participation will mean that maybe they're not going to listen to their parents Okay would you like to comment on this\n<$C> Yes I would say that uh the UN convention on the rights of the child which Kenya is uh signatory to it we ratified it in uh in nineteen ninety-one uh are called basic rights and this does not infringe on the rights of parents to decide what is the best for the children Instead the convention states uh government responsibility to keep uh parents together and to support and provide assistance to them so that they can fulfil their primary responsibility So the promotion of children's rights should not be seen as placing children in conflict with the adults but encouraging also the sense to work together for safe healthy and productive future Promotion of rights should however go hand in hand with tolerance of different views and opinions However responsible expression of uh opinion should be necessary People should not just talk you know they should also have responsible expression of opinion\n<$B> So what is the parents' role when it comes to this uh right to participation\n<$C> Uh I would say that the role of the parent is to guide the children Guide them as they make decisions uh Guide them as they talk about their rights uh The role of the parent really is to guide guide the child\n<$A> By way of negating the child's right to participation the Kenya Alliance for Advancement of Children has formed child rights clubs in a few primary schools in Nairobi and Kisumu Through these clubs children learn more about their rights and are in turn expected to tell other children and their parents about these rights Miss <name/> further explains about the child rights clubs\n<$C> Uh It's an organization that is established to advance interest and well-being of children in Kenya And what we're doing is that we have formed or established child rights clubs in few primary schools and secondary schools in Kisumu And it is in these clubs that children are taught their rights they emphasize those rights that have been denied and they are empowered to take action by sensitizing other children and the community about their rights So what we're doing is starting child rights clubs and the objective of the clubs is to create awareness to children about their rights and also to help build a culture of tolerance of different schools of thought uh freedom of expression and respect for the rule of law among children In the clubs also we promote the artistic talents of children through drama play song essay and poster competition and uh the idea here is to create a culture among children which is sensitive to the environment around them and even other children who are in difficult circumstances\n<$B> So at the moment how many child rights clubs do you have\n<$C> Uh we have in Kisumu we are working Kenya Alliance for Advancement of Children is working with the following schools We are working with Manjata Primary School We're also working with DHT Secondary School Orongo Primary School Kabuja Girls' School and a Ridge kids' programme and uh Fish youth group These are uh based around Kisumu municipality schools based around Kisumu municipality\n<$B> And here in Nairobi\n<$C> In Nairobi we are working with Bogasi Primary School <name/> Primary School Saint Bridget's Primary School <name/> School Saint Georges Secondary School Saint Teresa Street Children Programme and the Undugu Basic Education Programme that is situated in <name/>\n<$B> Now how do you select these uh schools\n<$C> Uh Kenya Alliance what we do is that we visit schools and hold various discussions with the head teachers If the head teachers are interested in the objectives of the clubs and the various activities we're going to have then they select a teacher who comes to our organisation and is trained on what the UN convention is all about and the objectives of the club of the clubs And it is these teachers who establish clubs or initiate formation of clubs in the schools\n<$B> So uh once they have formed a club what kind of activities do they take part in\n<$C> Uh in the clubs once we have trained the teachers uh our first thing that the teachers do uh is that children learn about their rights they are introduced to the UN convention on the rights of the child and issues affecting them like drug abuse health exploitation and other issues that are bound to come out As you're talking about uh children's rights which covers all areas uh of children and then children are given an opportunity to air their views on issues affecting them Then through song dance drama debate uh children come up with messages on what they have learned about drug abuse about education and they come up with messages which are passed on to other children uh on rights community responsibility could be of main importance of educating girls messages could be uh what the responsibility of the communities or what the responsibility of the child is and then these messages are uh are passed to the community and to other children We use children themselves to pass on messages about their own rights to other children and their community\n<$B> How do they go about that\n<$C> Uh what we have done is that we organize some of them are essay competitions and drawing competitions that are organized for children uh to discover their hidden talents Some children are very very talented You also find that uh when you organize essay and drawing competitions they all write about topical issues they have learned about Uh and once they write our role and task is to publish We try and publish works made by children and which is usually an incentive to them Kenya Alliance also mobilizes on special days set aside for children like the day of the African child or the universal children's day or any other forum It could be a schoolday it could be these special days that I've mentioned that are days set aside for children And it is through this kind of forums where children come up with different messages We also try and encourage the teachers uh on events that are set aside like uh the drama and music festival that messages children's rights messages come out through the plays and the songs and the on the play the play's songs and drama that they push through to that kind of activity And this year I'm happy to say that one of the clubs in Kisumu Manjata Primary School did have a song that came all the way to the National here in Nairobi at KACC\n<$B> And uh for how long have these child rights clubs been in existence\n<$C> Uh we started out with the idea of working with children in nineteen ninety-three that's when the Kisumu clubs were established We formed a committee in Kisumu where we mobilized organizations working on the ground in Kisumu Uh they came together and they came up with schools a number of schools where we formed the clubs that was in nineteen ninety-three And it is this idea they the clubs worked very very well they were very successful uh the clubs in Kisumu have been very very successful and we borrowed this idea and we have established the same this year in Nairobi\n<$B> So for Nairobi you're \n<$C> the clubs\n<$B> just beginning\n<$C> Yes the clubs are very new\n<$B> And uh as so far would you say you have uh tried to reap benefits or to say the benefits from the establishment of these child rights clubs\n<$C> I would say so yes because uh children have realized that they have some rights or they have rights they're entitled to different rights and from discussions held with them from reading their works that are submitted to us for publishing you see that there is an interest in children to learn about their rights to get to know about uh issues that involve them and to feel that they are part of uh decision making So I feel that they it has been very very successful I would also like to say that uh we've had requests from other schools and even beyond the boundaries of Kenya Uh different people are requesting the uh formation of child rights clubs in their countries We have had requests from uh Sudan and central part of Africa where organizations are requesting that uh we initiate a process where they can establish child rights clubs and this can be forums for children to air their views to get to know about their rights and also uh educate other children And what we are doing is that uh we are working on a manual which we hope to produce by the end of this year uh for moderators or facilitators of the child rights clubs", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '2814d0a5-29d6-42b9-a968-b8ee8db08413', 'added':

{'text': "<$A> Thank you uh as we are talking about gender there is the uh gender sensitization that uh Femnet usually carries out What is gender sensitization\n<$C> uh I would describe gender sensitization as a process by which a person comes to a knowledge of what uh effect first of all what are the roles that men and women carry out in society What is the effect of those roles the <O/> effect on men and women children old people both male and female and also just to realize the whole social dynamic that is conditioned by the different roles understand how for example uh one's behaviour as a man is conditioned by society and more importantly have an empathy for the other gender For example if you're a man and you come to a realization through a sensitization process that your upbringing makes you much more uh amenable to being aggressive and sometimes that aggression is not always good for the family then you become more sensitive by embarking on some kind of uh corrective programme under which you're going to regulate your behaviour to be fair to the other people \n<$A> uh Cecilia do you have something to add on to that \n<$B> No not so much more than what Mr Machete has said but just to add on what really gender sensitization is generally and I think it is sensitizing individuals on the perspective of seeing both women and men as playing a very important role in society It may mean even in the offices trying to sensitize both men and women on the various roles that both of them are playing as being important not seeing like for example a secretary whose who is a woman or that a secretarial job is basically that of a woman and seeing her as a lesser person within society but seeing her as contributing uh equally towards development as much as men and so a secretarial job should not just be for a woman but even it should be encouraged that men should see it as also a job that they can take on to themselves So it's actually sensitizing people to see people as equal players in the whole process \n<$C> I would also add that it has something to do with uh making people aware of their needs their problems their advantages everything to do with uh the other sex so to speak so that one does not is not imprisoned by uh stereotyping people for example deciding that you have been told that men are one two three and you decide without even uh looking at people individually that this is what every other woman or what every other man is going to be It's in fact a way of uh making people sort of rethink their views rethink the way society works and much more important try to make the world acceptable to both men and women \n<$A> Okay thank you very much How can uh people be sensitized in gender uh Cecilia how can people be sensitized in gender\n<$B> Uh that's a very important question because you keep hearing people ask you are talking about gender sensitization how can you be sensitized in gender but I think an initial place or the first really first place that one should be sensitized is within the family You know the way that the children you bring up your children within the family would be one of the very first steps that you start sensitizing both the boys and girls within the family by trying to show them that they can play all the roles equally and not see that there are roles that are set out for boys and that there are roles set out by girls and you know by trying to sensitize people and that's how they can start as a starting point to show their girls that they can also even study uh science subjects because we know that it's even from the house that we see our parents telling their children that you are a girl so I think you should do nothing and you are a boy I think you should do engineering So it's from that basic level the basic level the household unit that we can start by sensitizing people on gender issues \n<$C> I could also add that uh more on the process that you could sensitize people as Cecilia is saying by some conscious education programme by telling people to show by example and also uh by the way they instruct others that gender roles are complementary that there is really nothing God-ordained about those roles that have been carried out traditionally in a certain manner But there many other ways of sensitizing people in gender for example when it comes to the public sectors you are talking about the job market you are talking about relationships within uh a whole country a whole political system then uh the education campaign becomes much more a bit technical but it needs a lot of commitment from most of the people for example in showing how important it is in workplaces for there to be some kind of gender equity when carrying out things why it is important in politics for example to have as many men as there are women participating within that system so that if there are any differences if there in needs between men and women democratically they could be resolved in such a sphere The education takes on a wider scale on the bigger society and it needs maybe much more skills and knowledge about society and knowledge about the particular sectors within which people live in order to sensitize them Just take the farming sector for example It would take somebody who knows the kind of activities that take place in farming who carries out these activities just by coming to that knowledge is in itself a way of sensitization because for the first time maybe some of the roles carried out by men or women will become visible and the way these roles affect their lives and the other sectors within an economy is going to become known to people So assuming that after somebody has got some knowledge this in itself becomes a starting point towards changing\n<$B> And the first step is actually education deliberate efforts to attain this equity would be through education and we are talking about access to education by both men and women by both boys and girls having access to education as a starting point and then I think all the other things will follow naturally uh In Kenya we know that we have some problems some cultures that actually do not allow women to have access to land to even control the uh whatever they plant on the land Yet we know that they are the ones that are farming much more than any other person within the household These are some of the things that inhibit you know real equity as we are talking about gender equity There are other issues apart from just access to land access to livestock We could name a whole range of things that we know that one side like the female gender does not have access to this kind of thing but I would re-emphasize the fact that I think education would be a starting point so long as we make uh everybody have the same access to education I think we'd go a long way actually gender sensitization process \n<$A> When you talk about gender what are the critical areas that you need to focus on \n<$C> One could group them into different categories especially in the way they determine relationships That's basic areas which one could focus on starts right from uh the development process for example the activities that are carried out within society and who does what Also one looks at issues to do with uh resources access to those resources For example do men and women have equal or equitable access to the kind of resources that we have Let's keep in mind that the resources we have within a country within any economy are a national heritage of that particular country Therefore right from the beginning men and women ought to have equal access to those resources and conditions should be such that everyone regardless of whether they whether they are men or women or children should live under such conditions that they can aspire to the highest that the resources can allow and acquire it So issues of access and control of those resources are very important when you're looking at it We are also concerned with the whole area of what determines uh what goes on in society We are trying to understand for example how come in certain areas as Cecilia had mentioned cultures that some cultures have been oppressive in one way or another some cultures have encouraged violence of one gender against the other What makes them have such a heritage which definitely causes pain to other people Then uh there is the whole issue of striving as much as possible within gender sensitization also to put into place programmes and education campaigns anything that is going to have a corrective effect on the uh inequitable way society may be \n<$B> One of the important areas that we should be also identifying or integrating a gender perspective is within the whole decision making process I mean how do we see people that is both men and women playing a part from the very very lowest to the highest possible decision making process It's about also trying to make sure that we have an equal or at least some uh reasonable uh number of people to represent us in all the levels of decision making So that's another place that I think that we should be looking at very seriously and then just to go on to that even before thinking of how we can be able to integrate the whole gender perspective as I mentioned earlier I see it starting actually from a very low level trying to  start educating our youth How do we see young people now coming into this whole debate and how can we be able to help them to come into it because as I was saying before it's about training people from the very household level or trying to sensitize them at the household level or when they are young when they do not already know that there is a split in roles that if as I grow up as a man these are the roles I'm going to play and as I grow up as a woman these are the roles It's now starting to mould the youth or the young people to start realizing what their roles are within the whole society not to see their sisters as a lesser partner within the whole society but to see them as equal partners\n<$A> What role do you see men play \n<$B> I think that's a very important question at this point when we are discussing gender issues and we know that the conference actually is called the Fourth World Conference on Women It doesn't talk about gender but of women and as I was mentioning before is  that I really see a role for men to play it's not just a supporting role but a full role within uh our preparatory processes \nS1BINT1K\n<$D> so that the aspect of integration is coming into it The units definitely have as Mr Menya has mentioned their problem because children are there with one teacher sometimes for a long time Seeing the same teacher they have no change of face and they can have problems Their parents do have problems but the aspect today is looking at disabilities as a continuum of uh handicap that there are children who are mildly or moderately or severely and profoundly impaired And because of that some children can actually be individually integrated instead of just sticking into a unit set at a corner of school they can be individually integrated into the various classes in a in a school system \n<$A> among their colleagues\n<$D> Yes And in that way then they learn more and uh socially they develop better because they are mixing with others socially and also educationally\n<$A> They don't feel ostracised and therefore the moral is uh boosted\n<$D> Yes\n<$A> So as we can see then from our discussion so far that special education has suffered for many years due to many factors notably lack of qualified staff and the methodology used of sort of not taking care that these children are integrated among their colleagues Again one gets the impression that a scientific assessment of the problems involved uh have not really been sort of or rather has not been carried out properly and that uh in order to therefore deliver education effectively to this minority among fellow Kenyans uh there's need therefore to rectify if not to remove all these problems And this is where we're told the Kenya Institute of Special Education comes in as <ea/>Bwana Menya told us that the idea has been there for quite a while for almost thirty years we're told But it wasn't in fact until our president uh President Moi took it up more seriously more so when he declared uh the year the national Year of the Child in nineteen eighty that the matter was really taken in hand and within two years or so the institute began to be built Can we then hear from the Director exactly what the institute is supposed to do\n<$C> Thank you Mr Chairman\n<$A> Very briefly so that We don't want to\n<$C> Yeah This institute is an institute which we would call is unique in this part of the world and particularly we say so with a lot of pride because uh Kenya Government allowed children to have access to education And therefore this accessibility was made possible for children who are also handicapped and as you said in nineteen eighty and eighty-one these two years were of great significance to special education and uh as a result uh that particular period a lot of discussions went on on how we are going to improve the welfare of the disabled in the country in within those two years and the years to come As a result those of us professionals who are working in the particular field looked at various problems that were affecting the disabled persons and what we could do to move ahead And we realise we had quite a number of problems One of them was assessment of children and identification and placement of these children So the idea of an assessment programme became part of the institute We had the larger programme which was more understood by everyone else and that was teacher training so we combined all the teacher training programmes so that we are able to comprehensively train our teachers to handle and deal with the various disabilities more effectively So the teacher training programmes that Mr Menya mentioned were moved to this institute And they formed a core of programmes that uh are looking into the curriculum areas of special areas And then we have very recently because of problems and lack of space we felt we must have in-service programmes that will enhance training not only for teachers by but others as well So we started to have three months in-service courses which are regularly held running from currently with a diploma programme Then we have short courses This is also to reach more people one-day seminars for parents it can be for social workers other professionals that have got related field and programmes that handicapped people also can express themselves So we have those seminars going on And later on we felt we must do something about repair maintenance of equipment and possibly come up with alleviation of problems of making technical aids that uh can be easily available in this country There is uh a department there which is working extremely hard to come up with some of the technical aids for the various disciplines And then the question of awareness became of great concern to us and we have an elaborate very good library with rare books in Special Education booklets publications of materials bulletins all these are done by that particular department And the lastly recently we have felt the need to launch a programme at a distance in Special Education This will help us to reach not only the special teachers but also uh regular school teachers who have a large number of children with special problems in the regular school system and who could benefit from these programmes As a result uh the institute has become very comprehensive and intensive with the type of work we are doing\n<$A> Okay Maybe <ea/>Bwana Mwagiri could come here and tell us something about the courses as Director of Studies How are these courses uh fashioned\n<$D> Uh Thank you very much\n<$A> devised Do we have any precedents we base them on\n<$D> Thank you very much Mr Chairman Uh We did mention earlier on that the teacher training programmes had been there uh in scattered areas The mode of training was different from the mode that we're using now Uh Since the institute uh was started the students that come uh follow a programme which concentrates on areas that are kind of interdisciplinary in the first year so that all teachers who come there get some idea about special education generally They may be there to train as teachers for the blind or teachers for the physically handicapped but when they come first they're introduced to all areas of special education before going into their various corners to specialise in their main areas of specialisation\n<$A> It's a two-year course\n<$D> It's a two-year course and uh specialisation is usually done in the second year and the first year because there are so many things to be introduced and because of the kind of candidate we get sometimes he may have had some experience having taught in a special school or having worked in a special programme or they may just come straight from an ordinary primary school\n<$A> So your teacher trainees in fact are not those taken straight from high school\n<$D> No no\n<$A> Yes They have to have some teaching experience\n<$D> They have to have and this is not just Kenya Uh Most countries in the world follow the same kind of system that a teacher to train in a special area to teach children with special needs must be a trained teacher himself and must have worked with ordinary children before coming to specialise\n<$A> Okay Any further comment on the course content and uh\n<$D> Uh The course content if I may briefly say what is contained in it uh We know a lot of uh we hearing impaired children mentally handicapped children have problems with communication and therefore we have a component in the interdisciplinary area called uh Speech and Communication And then we also have an area called Educational Psychology which covers child development educational psychology itself and other areas of learning disabilities And then we have an area called uh did I mention the three I think I have mentioned the three Those are the main areas And then as I said earlier the second year is devoted to specific areas If the teachers of the hearing impaired they may do more language development and disorders they may do audiology the act of hearing If they are with the visually handicapped they will also concentrate on the ear on the eye and these problems\n<$A> So maybe <ea/>Bwana Kariuki could come in and illustrate to us for example you are the Head of the Department for the Visually Handicapped What do you teach teacher trainees there to make them help students\n<$E> Yes As Mr Mwagiri has uh said when the students come they are first of all exposed to the interdisciplinary components of the course\n<$A> Let's concentrate on the visually\n<$E> Yes and uh after they have left that course they come to us in the department and uh we teach them the anatomy and physiology of the eye We teach them Braille We teach them history of education of the blind We teach them psychology of the visually handicapped person We teach them learning process of the visually handicapped We teach them methods of teaching low-vision children We teach them orientation and mobility\n<$A> What's that orientation and\n<$E> Orientation and mobility Well when the visually impaired children who are born uh totally blind or with little vision usually have a problem in orientation They you know they have this problem in getting around We give them methods of finding their ways and carrying themselves around in the house outside you know ways of kind of uh finding their ways in new environments and techniques of uh self-defence you know so that they don't go bumping into walls and other persons\n<$A> So the teacher trainee once he's coached in those areas will help his uh\n<$E> The children where he goes to teach And finally we teach them methods of teaching the visually handicapped persons from the young children to the bigger children adapting of the curriculum and so on\n<$D> Maybe I can add something more\n<$A> Yeah\n<$D> And when we say teaching here the orientation and mobility we don't they are not just being trained within the institute to walk around We do as the Director said manufacture a number of teaching aids One of them is the white cane that you see blind people holding and getting around So they use those ones in the institute they go out sometimes\n<$A> Who does Who uses them\n<$D> The students and the teacher trainees\n<$A> Although they can see\n<$D> Although they can see they simulate by wearing something over their eyes and then holding that white cane and getting around\n<$A> For the viewers who don't quite know how the white cane works or helps could you tell us how it helps \n<$D> Uh Maybe Mr Kariuki can\n<$A> Is it for somebody else to see it and know that this is a blind man\n<$E> Partly so  partly soRRR the white cane is supposed to show you that the person who is coming is blind and at the same time it's made in a way such that the sound it produces is able to tell the blind person the kind of surface he is treading on and he can know whether this is grass whether of course he would detect an object with it and it will also tell him uh what kind of landmark in terms of land surfaces he's treading on\n<$A> Right so that then is an insight into the sort of training that goes on to produce qualified teachers to go and teach in uh special schools Can we now get an insight into another aspect of the work of the of the institute namely the whole question of educational assessment and resource services uh Mrs Abila could you give us a difference We gather that this is where you I think assess children\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> In other words although it is an institute for training teachers a parent maybe hearing us with a child who has a visual impairment can come to you also \n<$C> Yes\n<$A> for help in assessing how badly the impairment is how bad the impairment or otherwise\n<$C> Thank you Mr Chairman The idea of the assessment centres also came up as part of the institute quite earlier on because we realised that uh quite a number of schools were having children who were completely mixed up Some were blind mentally handicapped hearing impaired They were all kind of lumped together in one institution And we felt for remediation purposes we must S1BINT2K\n<$A> But don't you think this problem has been there for quite a while like the Moi Avenue and Muranga Road junction There is this problem and even a pedestrian is confused where should I cross\n<$B> Well maybe that does not come to our notice otherwise it would have been corrected as early is possible\n<$A> And uh there was a time when you really emphasised on safety belts especially for private motorists But up to now this has not been put into effect Is there any action which is being taken against cars which don't have safety belts\n<$B> Yeah we had uh we had amounted some operations all to reinforce laws in this aspect But the problem is that sometimes people are complaining of materials becoming so expensive So they are combined with the directives who are the authority Otherwise to my knowledge I could say a safety belt is something very important In any case somebody lose control and goes to a ditch by the time he is having that safety belt on he's far much safer than the time when he's you know having no safety belt He can easily be thrown out before the car lands to a ditch Or he can be thrown out to a ditch and then the car can follow him So it is a good use for one to make of that thing\n<$A> And uh traffic signs are very important The road uh signs because some people will not know that there is a sharp corner somewhere But uh travelling along Pica Road I think some of the sign posts have been sort of misplaced another one is facing the wrong direction Is the traffic department in charge of that looking at times at the road signs and seeing whether they're in the proper position\n<$B> Yes that's why we're trying to recommend our public in case you come across these signs which are not properly fitted or erected uh you inform us immediately and then action is taken Otherwise we are also very sad to see that a a driver who is now supposed not to go right There is a sign showing that no right turn still the Simpson cook or Simpson driver goes right This is very serious and that's why you'll find our police officers uh ever busy uh <O/> these people and uh at least tell them what they know\n<$A> Children going to school and coming from school in Nairobi have a problem especially the younger ones And there used to be a time when someone used to assist the children to cross the road And I don't see this much these days Did you get the idea out or is it still operating?\n<$B> No we're still operating We've got our police officers on those places where a school was built near a busy road We have got a school bus run They are there helping the schoolchildren But we also have to do this schoolchildren not to play about by the roadside or in the middle of the road or sometimes standing right You know the thing is he is given the fare to go to school and back home He gets into a bus maybe a yellow bus or any kind of bus And then the child starts <O/> the conductor finally she finds out that or that's the place I'm going to get off or to alight And then before he waits for the bus to stop or the <ea/>matatu stop she jumps off from this bus This is the kind of thing we don't want So we're asking even in this case to be taking care you should not until you arrive <O/>\n<$A> <Ea/>matatu drivers have a habit of blocking buses here in Nairobi and then when they see a police car they really disappear And then after some time the <ea/>matatus are back Is the police trying to do something about this because it's something which they know is there\n<$B> Yes we have already taken action There are some places where <ea/>matatus are not supposed to be ferrying some passengers such as Kencom and <O/> bus stages These are places where we don't want all these <ea/>matatus to pile up there waiting for passengers We the authority has decided to set aside some places where <ea/>matatus can go according to their route can go and line up for passengers But in such places where in fact in <O/> if these foreigners come for example somebody who comes from uh UK or something in the States he stays in that hotel Ambassador and then he finds all these <O/> people are banging <ea/>matatus calling passengers with the uh toting It's very bad That's why it was decided to <ea/>matatus to be set aside and then buses to follow their own route\n<$A> People working in the city centre at times they have a problem of parking and they'll park anywhere maybe Corporal A you can tell us where to park because some people really have a problem in parking\n<$B> Yes the problem is one Everyone wants to come to the city centre uh forgetting that we are now cumulating ourselves <O/> Okay the human traffic the motorists when they come together you'll find the condition of that movement is becoming thick So the parking is becoming a problem because of you know there are so many buildings there are so many vehicles there are so many human traffic So this a problem Otherwise maybe that uh we shall be sending our city to Machakos areas like that so that we'll get enough parking At the moment well the problem is not for a person alone it is for a problem to better take care We better obey the laws not causing obstruction by parking *anyhowly> you better get to uh bay parking bays or places set aside for a vehicle to be parked Otherwise the problem is very wide for everybody not only for police officers or \n<$A> But suppose someone sees as an individual okay there is no parking here but I think my car will be safer at a certain place and I'm not blocking any car Then the police traffic department comes and tows the car away Maybe this is a bit unfair for a motorist\n<$B> No I don't think the vehicle will be towed away if it has been safely parked It will only be towed when it has been parked against a yellow lines or a place where there's a restriction an example a place where an ambassador has parked his vehicle Such a place is not equivalent to park It was set aside for a particular reason\n<$A> And how much time do you take before you inform a motorist that his car has been towed away\n<$B> Well I don't understand your question\n<$A> Okay I've found my vehicle has been towed away and I might suspect it is kept How long will you inform\n<$B> Find out <O/> As soon as this complaint or the owner of the vehicle is looking for his vehicle We have a contor room where all these vehicles are towed away and then the commissions passed there In any case a complainant or a person comes to us for his vehicle straight away we shall find a we take a record as far that person that go to a certain position for your vehicle But normally we do that for their own safety we don't do this thing for our own pleasure no\n<$A> For people reporting to work early in the morning buses have really become a problem and some are forced to hang But at a short distance they're arrested for hanging at the doors What is the main aim of doing this\n<$B> No it is not uh uh any to punish member of public but we are trying all we can to reduce uh road accidents An example if uh a child is hanging at the doorsteps I'm telling you for the strong man who is going to push this child can easily lose his grip or her grip and then fall out So when you find a policeman trying to do all this kind of work they're trying to help members of public And it is one way of educating the members of public from now on Otherwise if you only sit and watch I'm telling you people will ride even on top of the roof\n<$A> And uh what happens there for the buses which are going very far let's say to Muranga to Nyeri I don't see the same thing happening\n<$B> Yes an example I think you'd have said why you have some passengers standing in these buses Well and good According to the licensing officer you must have set aside before passengers in a sitting capacity and a few to hang on in that uh rear inside the bus And there at the same time if the bus is on motion all doors the rear door and the front door are easily closed for their own safety\n<$A> There are people who actually go smoking inside <ea/>matatus Yet there was uh a rule actually which was passed that people should not smoke in public places Yet you find others smoking in <ea/>matatus and this is quite unfair to people who don't smoke but the police are not doing anything about it\n<$B> No sorry No we are doing something Unless I've never come across police doing this kind of work but we are always insisting no member of public should smoke in the vehicle or the driver plus the conductor One thing is in a hygienic it is bad to smoke There are some people who are who are not fond of hearing or feeling this smell They can easily vomit Once again a person who is jealous enough can find you in a good suit while you are not realising anything he can put that cigarette to an end and then you find your suit being burned Once again for the sake of the chemicals which is which are in that vehicle can easily get burned So we are insisting and still it is a law that whoever smokes in that public vehicle is an offence\n<$A> Some of the cars which I see along our roads are very old How do you *fine> define an *unroadworthy> vehicle because some are very old Is it ten years twenty years or thirty years ago\nS1BINT3K\n<$A> In tonight's edition of the programme Preview I talk to Peter Nganga of Miujisa Players who directed The Lion and the Jewel a play that has been going on for the last few days and winds up on the twenty-fifth of this month October I have also talked to a few uh artists from Nalin and Naiki Artists and of course as it is your show this programme Preview we shall also bring you our critic Okumba Miruka Stay tuned \nWe're privileged in this night's edition of the programme Preview to be with Mr Peter Nganga who is or rather who directed the play The Lion and the Jewel which has been staged by Mjisa Players at the Rahmtula Library Mfangano Street in Nairobi Could you please tell us why you chose or what inspired you to choosing this play The Lion and the Jewel by Wole Soyinka \n<$B> Well first of all it's a humorous play it's a comedy and uh it plays very well into the Kenya situation of old versus young and the young elite educated people against the more conservative traditional wise people And uh in this play we see a small a struggle for a village girl between an old crafty chief and this young educated man uh Lakunle So I think basically it was for the entertainment purpose a play where people would come in after a hard day's work sit back relax and enjoy themselves \n<$A> It's only about a week ago when you staged My Husband Has Gone Mad Again \n<$B> Two weeks\n<$A> And that was uh about uh or rather some works by a West African author I don't know why you decided to go back to West Africa again to pick on The Lion and the Jewel \n<$B> As against which other part \n<$A> Uh either maybe you could have maybe gone around any other region of Africa and \n<$B> I think looking at West Africa from my own personal experience the authors there have uh well let me say literature wise they are more so to speak advanced Or rather they're more the plays and uh novels are a deeper thing For East Africa we have a a few good plays but most of them are quite serious plays which you need to sit down and think hard and understand We're basically looking for a very funny play which uh would be accommodated by any kind of audience \n<$A> Are you going to say you're trying to look for something comical \n<$B> Yes that's <O/> I'm trying to say \n<$A> Does that therefore express a fact that uh you got it easy maybe to cast your to have your cast in The Lion and the Jewel \n<$B> Not really What happens in The Lion and the Jewel is that it's more or less a straight-forward play Casting was not too difficult We did casting at the same time we were casting for the musicals \n<$A> What \n<$B> Phoenix and Miujisa and during that time we came to I was there and I chose my cast gradually but I don't really think we had any major problems with casting We have a lot of young talent in Nairobi a lot of young talent so the casting part wasn't really sort of a problem \n<$A> In your talk you seem to reflect a relationship between Miujisa and Phoenix Players Is there any \n<$B> Yes I would term Mujisa to be a sister company to Phoenix Players actually uh The idea behind Mujisa which is credited to Steve Munesi and Mr James Falkland who uh James Falkland is the a director at uh Phoenix Players and actually two of them did come up with the idea of Mujisa uh plus a few other people about two years back and turned it from an idea into reality with the help of many people of course \n<$A> Miujisa is a Swahili word and do you intend to perform any Swahili plays \n<$B> For the moment I can't give an answer on that because I'm really not so sure What I can tell you that we're having a Christmas musical and we're having uh Smile Orange after my production of The Lion and the Jewel \n<$A> Tell us uh briefly what then what has been the response like for the last few days you've staged The Lion and the Jewel \n<$B> Ah slow at first but uh it's picking up You know the thing about theatre is especially amongst Africans we really don't have a theatre-going community uh Maybe because the theatre's out of town or out of reach for their pockets but they come in they watch the play if it's good you know the African situation they spread the word and it's picking up Last few days we really had a good good houses The delight about Mujisa is that it's African and for the Africans such that after the play you actually end up discovering you know quite a number of people in the house and so you're asking them questions They are commending you for the play or criticizing where it's bad and that kind of thing so it's really a two-way process It's us playing to them and them giving them giving us uh feed-back and that's kind of the relationship we're really trying to develop because it harmonizes both the theatre and the community And in that as long as our production level's high and high quality we hope to get more people integrated into theatre because it's not that Africans don't have money it's just that them and theatre it's never really been one common bond \n<$A> Then how you train as a body to make sure that you will attract and a good number \n<$B> Well paramount of course is quality of our productions they have to stay really high I mean Going Back to Her Husband has gone mad again that was superb and I mean by all standards it was a very high quality production And that is the kind of thing we're going to keep on having Uh I mean you get the actors you get a good director and as long as your III play standards are up and the plays are appreciated by the people it's going to come And again it's the actors interacting in the society You're bringing in your friends your relatives And it's African I mean it's just your African village situation You see something good then go and tell everybody about it \n<$A> Monday the twentieth of October will be a Kenyatta Day The group <name/> Artists will be staging the play Born to a Lesser God at the Kenya National Theatre And now we are very privileged to be in the studio with uh Angela Mambo who is directing this play and also Katrin Karia who is producing this play Now Angela Mambo how did you go about casting \n<$C> uh What we did is we chose the cast from the thirty members we are and we gave privilege to those who have not performed in an earlier production because we like everyone being part of the group so we want everyone to be involved in the production So we had an audition and chose the best from the whole group \n<$A> Maybe Katrin Karia could tell us what it is all about to be Born to a Lesser God I mean what does it talk about I mean what is it telling us \n<$D> Okay The play now the name Born to a Lesser God is actually a question We're asking this Are Africans born to a lesser God Now because uh like you see we Africans today we seem to be like so pressed by the Western who economically politically culturally we've been following their fashion It's as if we've stopped kind of like thinking Now we're asking are we Africans are we lacking something compared to them Are they better than us as we have to just follow their ways and something like that So through the play we say that we are actually not born to a lesser God Yah\n<$A> <#/>Now Angela Mambo how have you gone about this because uh what are the key issues you're bringing out in this play apart from what she has mentioned because she has just outlined it \n<$C> Okay Maybe I would say the main things Okay It's expressed through three students It's actually set in a school and it's expressed through three African students It's a talent school I would say It's expressed through Africans three African students who are not allowed to do what they have as Africans and only get uh they only get praise when they do something Western than what is African \n<$D> The African the other students in the school who are now who are foreigners now they're like money civilization Now these names are symbolic Now these students oppress these African students They don't allow them to be themselves Like uh the school is an art-school actually So like you can see there is a music student there's a student who draws something like that So like you can see this foreign student telling them Sing this song or that's not good and something like that \n<$C> We have the names which are symbolic and which will tell you what we are talking about and uh what the students do everything the students do is symbolic as in Africa as a whole and the Western world \n<$A> What are these names that are symbolic maybe you could mention a few \n<$C>- Maybe there's money civilization\n<$D> Asina despair for the African students and dignity Okay will come and then he tell the head and say that we are not born to a lesser God Okay Now throughout the play they're talking about this talent show Now it's a show which is held every year by the students at that school Now in that talent show is where they show what what you've been working on throughout the whole school-year So now in the talent show you see that the African students perform very well Now that's how we come to the point \n<$A>  That's how you come to the point And that's are you trying to say that's the climax \n<$D> Yeah \n<$A> And that uh the Africans\n<$C> How the Africans perform according compared to the Westerners \n<$A> Eventually the Africans come up the best \n<$D> Yeah or just as good if not if not uh better\n<$A> Just as good if not better \n<$D> Yes that's what I say \n<$A> Now have you had previous scripts before \n<$C> Yes we've performed one play which was in March It was Ultimate Weapon written by the same writers Pauline Njogu and Ann Wambugu Yeah we performed it in March \n<$A> And uh are you just dwelling on original scripts or do you have do you intend to adopt a few scripts \n<$C> No we intend to keep on original scripts \n<$D> We encourage that \n<$C> Mainly from the group mainly \n<$A> How many members are you presently \n<$C> We are about thirty members \n<$A> It's quite a group quite a groupRRR Is it only made up of ladies 'Cause so far you have not any gentlemen taking part \n<$C> No we have \n<$A> You've not told me who's taking which part and\n<$D> Okay The African students \n<$C> Yeah the African students: we have Pamela Asina which is being taken by Jackie Kiarie we have Despair by Robert Kioko and Dignity by James Mwangi And then as the Westerners we have Money which is being taken by Katrin Karia and civilization by Irene Irene Njau And then there's Principle which is being taken by I Angela Mambo and Uncle Amani by Charles Nulunga \n<$A> How do you get uh these roles so well done as a director and you're also taking part as one of the cast Angela Mambo \n<$C> Okay what I do is I have a co-director as when I'm doing my part you know normally we take individual characters for the time being and then when you combine the whole play then I get my co-director to do it for me Yeah\n<$A> Thank you very much I've been talking to Katrin uh Karia and Angela Mambo from Nelin and Haiki Artists who have actually concentrated very much on the production of original scripts and staging of the same scripts They start off or they take off on the twentieth of October which is just by the doorway with the play Born to a Lesser God And the play runs soon up to the twentieth of October Nice time \nS1BINT4K\n<$A> In your experience at the University of Nairobi have you come across cases where the wardens help the student to cope with a degree choice that he or she has been given \n<$B> Yes it does happen uh not often but it does happen You may have a student who was who wanted to do for example law and uh they didn't make it you know in terms of the points that they they got at the end of the examination and uh they were for example given uh a BA uh programme to pursue and they feel all the time that they wanted to pursue this so they would come to for example to a warden and ask what exactly they should do They find it very difficult to adjust to this other uh degree that they had not chosen and uh usually what would happen is uh a lot of counselling goes on to this so that the student does not waste time thinking about something that they cannot be uh given because of the problem of the points uh and being encouraged to take uh what they have been given not to give up and to uh realise to try to realise uh uh a different kind of goal with this degree that they have they haveRRR been asked to you know to pursue which is a BA General and with that you know a warden can advise the student on what to do They can pursue law for example at a later stage you know or do something that is you know that has a legal uh perspective later in life or to be quite satisfied with what they will be given in the BA uh degree so it varies and it depends on the severity of the problem and the way the student is taking it \n<$A> What about the peer pressure Is there increasing peer pressure amongst the students so that uh some of them fail to cope with the degree programme because of the peer pressure amongst the \n<$B> Yes you see all these most of these students are in their adolescent stage and uh they are all undergoing uh quite a turbulent period of their lives They can be very stressful uh if for example they do not have a group of peers which is supportive in the sense that uh if they selected for example uh a degree programme which their friends you know did not select they feel out of place and uh one needs to give them a sense of belonging you know to wherever they have been taken So this peer pressure can be of a homing to some students so I wouldn't counsel for example in explaining what exactly you know goes on what they would become uh by taking this other degree which was not their choice and helping uh also with handling the other you know the other friends the other peers so that they are supportive and facilitative to the other to this particular student who has a problem and uh we have found that to be quite useful uh when uh peers are counselling each other you see\n<$A> Do you have a problem with the parent of a child who may not want their child to pursue a certain degree course but another one Is there that kind of pressure in the universities \n<$B> I believe it is there  but it usually doesn't filter into the halls and it is handled at the administration uh uh place you know They would go there and these things would be explained to them uh so the for example the administration registrars would explain to a particular parent uh the problem that may be with their student you know that will bring problems to the student as they try to pursue whatever degree it is So there is that kind of thing uh but the parents are guided and they are also you know it is explained to them what exactly uh does happen and what has happened and what would happen in the future you know they are also guided because many of them may not even know what uh this all these degree programmes are all about and all these things are explained to them by the administration \n<$A> You said that the warden is an academic uh member of staff is there a reason for that \n<$B> Yes there is a reason for that because uh it is believed that this person who interacts with the students in the classroom is also you know suited to interacting with them elsewhere which is in their halls of residence so there's continuity in the helping process and in the counselling so uh a warden who is a teacher who is a lecturer or a professor for that matter they know the problems that the student is having  in the classroom uh which might interfere with life in the hall so they are best-suited to deal with the problem because they already know the person and uh they can follow the problem you know even in the place of living So it is quite useful and it creates what you might call an enabling environment for this lecturer to deal with whatever problem might arise uh with a particular student \n<$A> When you are talking about the support services which the student is given at the universities you mean church chaplains what kind of a support service do they give exactly \n<$B> The chaplains uh We have three uh kinds of chaplains we have a protestant chaplain a muslim uh chaplain and a catholic chaplain They deal with the different faiths because we have all kinds of uh students with a different faith so they are catered for in that way They also have their own counsellors you know in the chaplains so they come they listen to students' problems as they arise They may not necessarily be problems to do with faith They may be problems that uh have come from the classroom or from the hall or from the games field It really depends uh and these people you know listen to the students and if they cannot handle the problem they would also get the warden and they can have a conference with the student and try to help They may even get the games person or the medical person or the person from the dean of students' office and they uh you know try to help the student as a group you know when they try to understand the student's problem that way\n<$A> And you also said that uh some of the students are young they're adolescents and have those emotional problems besides their academic work which is so different from the school work that they were used to in the high schools Those who have to cope with emotional problems who helps them to cope with the emotional problems that they face in the university where they're interacting between sexes and within sexes \n<$B> uh This is a very uh tricky problem and very complex As I said earlier these students are in the adolescent stage which can be very stressful It can be tension creating and you need to create an environment where the students the student does not feel alone you know while solving problems and so on whether they are of a personal nature or of you know whatever other kind We have encountered some students who have very supportive parents for example and therefore they're very mature in the way they deal with uh themselves their own bodies for example uh the the problems that come because of physical development uh mental development and so on Their parents are very supportive and we actually we encourage this that parents become very involved emotionally involved in their you know children's development you know emotional and otherwise because we have found that kind of student also helpful in solving the other students' problems you know We would invite a mature student to help us help another one who is distressed uh These problems as I said can be very complex Some are overwhelmed because uh they really don't know how to deal with the situation you know particularly when it is in of an emotional uh kind We therefore uh befriend the student you know and try to help create a helping conducive environment and this would mainly be in the hall so that the person does not feel that they're the only ones in the world having  this problem We give examples of people other people who have gone through whatever the problem is They have come out of it you know unscathed and so on and the student therefore learns that they're  not the only ones with this particular problem So it it may uh really depend on the student the support they get from their parents and also from their former schools teachers headteachers for example who have also been very useful in many ways uh in helping these students to grow up Their personal goals becomes  very very useful uh if it is mature uh at the school situation before they come to the university and uh you know when we get a student who has for example been a prefect we find differences between that student and other students who were just following because they are usually very mature and in the way the wayRRR they deal with themselves and with the students in the halls of residence for example \n<$A> I think mostly there's a lot of uh time a lot of freedom and the student is guided only by the degree programme itself and there's a lot of time for them to do all kinds of things Do they face problems in coping with this freedom because they are coming from an environment where they were totally protected by in the high schools especially the boarding school to an environment where that protection is not there  so is there a difference as they transcended from school children into adults\n<$B> Yes there are there are problems in time management There`s so much time that some don't even know what to do with it uh and they are so free that uh some cannot really apportion the day properly You know they can they're so free that they can sleep the whole day and not come to class you know That option is there but it is to their disadvantage and we tell them so They are given lectures all the way from when they come the first day to the university by the <O/> <O/> and it is followed into the halls by the wardens the chaplains come in the counsellors come in the doctors come in and so on and we help them to you know to apportion the day for themselves There are very many lectures for them to attend and they have to do that in time you know If they go thirty minutes late to a class it is to their disadvantage We explain all this to them If they sleep the whole you know the whole day and they're active at night which sometimes does happen then it is also disadvantageous so we explain all these things uh during their entry to the university I should have said at the beginning that when they come into the hall for example they themselves uh elect a house committee which is composed of the students themselves and they would have uh a chairperson of their choice and the warden would be there to oversee what happens So if there's a problem in the hall for example they report it to this person who then uh takes it to the warden or it comes through the custodian because there is an intermediary there and uh the problem can be solved within no time uh because it could depending on the problem it could even be a bulb if there's no bulb the student needs a bulb then they go to the custodian and that fits the problem itself It's only when it is for example a problem with a social need or psychological need where the warden may be called upon to deal with that uh situation \n<$A> Are there some degree programmes which are more taxing than others so that there may be some new students who can afford to sleep the whole night and the whole day because of their work load Are there differences \n<$B> In general a university student should be fully occupied you know uh the whole day because there's a lot to be done \nS1BINT5K\n\n<$A> Let me first of all even say or one of the that you have seen that tribalism has been even within the university and in most African universities and uh this is a very sad thing because even uh before there was a change and uh I can talk of the University of Nairobi We had a chairman of the departments for uh several years They're self-appointed or appointed by a chairman of the departments And they used before uh you know twelve years fifteen years and so forth And they had a tendency irresistible tendency to uh appoint lecturers from their own ethnic background to the detriment of other even qualified lecturers uh from other areas And if you look at even African uh universities there is that tendency also among the intellectuals to practise that What we need we as intellectuals should appoint people on purely merit And this should be from all ethnic groups \n<$B> Dr Mulindi what is the role of an intellectual in society\n<$A> Well I think the role of an intellectual in a society first and foremost is to think and find solutions to problems that are facing our society That is the role of an intellectual Now society pays intellectuals to think to find solutions to problems And there is no society which you can develop without intellectuals That's why we have schools That's why we have uh institutions of higher learning And if you look in some particular countries you have even specialized institutions for particular types of solutions of problems facing a particular society So there is no way that a country can do without intellectuals\n<$B> Okay okay point taken but in your view Dr Mulindi has the Kenyan intellectual done something uh to help this country at least get rid of tribalism Have you played that role yourself You are an intellectual There are several other intellectuals we have in this country Here we are talking about tribalism and uh the bad things that go with tribalism What have you done\n<$A> Yeah I mean uh there are some intellectuals who are concerned about this problem That is why we are talking about it and discussing it And uh some of us have had to write quite a lot about this issue and uh to educate the public on the role of intellectuals in assisting the uh country in understanding the aspirations of the people and trying to guide them I mean first and foremost that is the role of the intellectual And also of highlighting some of the limitations of uh those that may disgrace or uh uh go aside in practising uh those issues that we think that are a detriment for the well-being of uh this society \n<$B> In nineteen eighty-nine uh you talked about uh I think you know something about the evils of tribalism Is that the time when we realised tribalism was at its peak\n<$A> Oh yes I noticed that uh it was at its peak and uh I predicted with uh quite accuracy <  what is happening right now and what was bound to to happen What I predicted is that uh in African societies and in Kenya included uh various pressure groups tend be organised on tribal lines And you know uh uh pressure groups in Africa are intellectuals amongst uh you know other uh uh participants And I saw the tendency that to organise people on tribal lines was a very dangerous thing that can destroy the unity of this nation uh which you know has paid uh a lot of uh cost for development I mean we managed to be united\n<$B> Have you done any tangible research to support what you're saying I mean are you limiting yourself to Kenya or do you have other countries in Africa in mind \n<$A> I have all other countries in Africa but that I can give example I can give an example from Nigeria I mean you see one particular tribe voted that it was above all And because of the Yoruba the colonial setup you had people from one area enlightened And they thought that they had the monopoly over everything And you know this has brought down Nigeria Uh you know very well uh the writings of uh you know Chinua Achebe What has gone wrong uh what is wrong with the Nigerian You know the writings of Wole Soyinka the Nobel Prize winner Uh if you look at Uganda uh because of also the setup the economic setup and the colonial setup we have one tribe uh being uh ahead of others uh uh particularly the Bagandan They thought that they were entitled to everything and monopolized everything to the detriment of the uh Ugandan people the majority of the Ugandan people And this has brought out a lot of uh problems in that country I could go on even and name the examples of uh\n<$B> Yeah there are several others\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> But now uh how can we then tackle the problem\n<$A> I think first\n<$B> Because it's easy talking the way you and I are talking now But what are intellectuals doing about it And is it the problem of the intellectuals only Is it a problem for everybody And does language play a role\n<$A> Indeed language plays a very important role in uh tribalism And the intellectuals must enhance uh common language uh When people have one common language they have a problem of understanding themselves And if you look at those societies which I've mentioned one is language uh Let me give you an example Our neighbours here in Tanzania\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> uh One of the that they have done and why really uh I say that they are ahead of us is they managed to unite \n<$B> Tanzania\n<$A> Tanzania For the common purpose of speaking one language which is Swahili \n<$B> That's Kiswahili\n<$A> And in the villages and everybody feels he is a Tanzanian We still feel I'm a Luo I'm a Kalanjin I'm a Kamba I'm a Kikuyu You know language plays a very important thing\n<$B> Right\n<$A> So intellectuals must enhance the unification of uh this nation by one enhancing uh Swahili and English as principle medium \n<$B> You could have a point but look at the case of Somalia I think they use uh one language That is Somali But how come uh We've seen uh things since <O/> disintegrate\n<$A> No no no The question of Somali is quite complicated\n<$B> Yeah but they have one language\n<$A> Theydon't have one language They have a colonial setup You know very well the German setup They have the uh Italian setup and uh they have also the French setup And uh with this built up on the colonial setup the various ethnic groups in that particular area have had that advantage to the detriment of others depending on where they went And this is one of the that has caused a lot of animosity amongst the the Somali people Although they speak one language there is that disparity there is that uh unequal development unequal opportunities for everybody And being practised by one tribe\n<$B> So in your view uh Dr Mulindi You are a psychiatrist in your own right Right \n<$A> Well uh I am a psychologist\n<$B> You are a psychologist Well uh why in your view as a psychologist should some communities feel superior to others Why\n<$A> Well uh I think it is first uh because of uh the colonial uh setup and secondly to the large number and thirdly because of the uh material wealth that might be <O/> That's one thing and the intellectual capacity that they may have But if they have what I am saying is that they should see it in terms of uh equal distribution of nationalism There is no way in Africa one tribe can uh uh dominate or impose itself to  the majority It does not work It has not worked anyway It's not going to work\n<$B> So uh back to intellectuals We talked about intellectuals and the impression one gets is that uh intellectuals are the sort of people who should be thinking and help solve problems But it does appear we have uh what I would call illiterate intellectuals Is there something like that We have some intellectuals who are actually illiterate\n<$A> Yeah I agree There are many people uh in this society who might be illiterate They are educated but they lack wisdom Now you know it's one thing to have a Ph D or to go to university or to come but it's another to understanding the people And that's why I am insisting that the psychology of understanding your people is crucial One must understand uh uh people's aspirations motivations sense of direction and uh limitations And as an intellectual one must guide his people There are many things which are going wrong in this country and intellectuals never had a say They never guided uh uh the majority of the people They never showed They They never identified with the communities to understand the problems Uh well I have had the opportunity of of serving on the National AIDS Control Programme and I have run around the whole of this country And that has taught me a lesson that I don't know anything I have to learn about my people I was educated in Europe like <O/> world our education system is basically from uh uh you know abroad or based uh on uh teaching from Western universities Right But how much of this is relevant to our people to understanding our people\n<$B> It is amazing Dr Mulindi you are interested in subjects uh which we cannot find solutions to You are interested in AIDS and here you are talking about tribalism and you don't seem to be offering a solution Now what uh is that the sort of education we get Or where we get educated Uh Does the fact that we get educated out of the country have a bearing on the way we think about our uh communities\n<$A> Oh yes\n<$B> I I'm asking uh should we allow our children to be educated outside Kenya and if we did would that mean that they would uh be alienated to the extent that they will not even care about uh matters concerning them at home\n<$B> Oh yes oh yes uh One of the thing that you need to do is uh first and foremost is that our children for the first degree it is if it is recommendable is that they should get it here And then they should go on abroad for specialization in those subjects or fields that cannot be offered here locally uh A lot of effort must be made in that direction One other thing is that as you said that if you are trained in a particular country you have a tendency to think in that framework And what we have seen here in Kenya is that we have many people who have trained abroad hoping that they can solve Kenyan problems from a different perspective without understanding the people that they are working with And this is why things are failing  \nS1BINT6K\n\n<$B> The group's main objective is to portray women positively through literature \n<$A> Positive portrayal of women is that stories which say it as it is you know we all know that the women are actually the ones who are feeding this nation that the women do so much Women are the agriculturalist women are everywhere but when it comes to uh uh portrayal or when it comes to taking credit we don't get credit What we are trying to do is gradually to tell the women here you know the work that you are doing is very very important You are getting a raw deal not in a bad way but just to sort of sensitise them make them aware\n<$B> Asenath Bole Odaga coordinator of the Kenya Women Literature Group Asenath started by writing for children then for the youth and today she's a novelist\n<$A> My last novel is called Riana It's about a young girl who leaves school because she's annoyed Her father has let down the family and then she gets married and then from there all sorts of things happen to her And this is a true story about a young African woman\n<$B> A story like that one what kind of message uh do you intend to portray to the readers and who is the audience\n<$A> The audience obviously is not just the women but all Kenyans men and women because as we say we cannot change the the treatment of women in our literature unless we sensitise the men also so my story really is not just meant for young women or for women but it's meant for everybody because women don't live alone in this world We live with men and they also need to know our feelings what we feel about the traditional treatment of women and then of course we try to influence them make them sensitive about it\n<$B> How much do you see literature women's literature contributing to influencing this kind of change\n<$A> I think quite a lot because for the last thirty years I would say very few women have written really to try and change give women a new image because what we have now is that in the literature which is written by men women are either portrayed as prostitutes or as rebels or as serving the man not really We never come out in our real role yet we play so much role  so many important roles We do so much for the society into that and to the development of our country So I think this will make a change In fact already there is one uh some change I remember Achebe's last uh novel The Anthills of the Savannah The treatment Achebe accords the woman there the main not the main character really but one of the women character  there is really commendable but still I quarrel with him because instead of The boyfriend has been killed okay but instead of the woman remaining to stand alone there's a man there is another man hovering behind there a son a brother a father a husband or somebody but a man must always be there Yet we have today in this country many women who have brought up uh full-grown families on their own doing their but that is never really you know projected\n<$B> The Kenya Women Literature Group uh does not bring together women who can write stories only but also women who can tell stories to others for them to be written\n<$A> We would have a group where grass-roots women would come together tell their stories Those who can write would write it down Those who cannot write will also tell the stories to somebody who can write Then we would have it written down And so far we have uh two volumes We have had two volumes The first one has got four stories two traditional stories or narratives and two creative stories and the the second volume has got ten stories five narrative and five creative stories and these are stories by grass-roots women some women who have who don't know how to read or write but they told these stories to their sons or to their children who know how to read and write who wrote the stories down sent them to us and we advertised for these stories and we received close to a thousand stories We read through them selected ten which were the winning ones and it is from this ten when we called the women there was going to be a prize to be given The day we called them we discovered that some of the authors are illiterate but they are very intelligent women and this was very very encouraging We thought we'd do more of this Now what we want to do is to expand that we will have a maybe groups in every region a group consisting maybe of twelve women and they will have uh a region maybe a district They will have someone also I mean several uh groups in a district and they will write They give it to somebody in the district to read the stories The good ones will be passed to the head office of KWLG and if they are very good we will have them published but we think that we'll now move away from advertising for the stories to come Instead we'll just have the women writing all the time They write in their groups The stories are read and are sent and are are uh selected The best ones are read Then we'll also have reading reading days in the districts when uh women can in their region or even in location they call everybody together and they read some of these stories\n<$B> Asenath Odaga illustrates what would happen in a reading session through this creative story in which\n<SA>  A man actually sent this his second wife a young wife away because the wife has got just six daughters and no sons So she is sent away but she doesn't Mumbi doesn't give up Mumbi continues to work to be everywhere All the building sites in Nairobi everywhere Mumbi carries things on her back in  her head everywhere to sell and take her daughters to school Mumbi takes the daughters to school They learn They get jobs They are working They have things uh a little house for Mumbi Now the man who sent her away many many years ago now old and sick limps back into her life and then we tell these stories to the women and said <ea/><O/> <ea/><O/> if you were Mumbi what would you do And then there starts a very hard argument and uh discussion Some women say I will never have him back because he left me when he was young He is coming back for me to nurse him back So these are some of the kind of things we are saying We are saying you know you are a woman you are working very hard so you must know that least if it wasn't for Mumbi the mother of these girls these girls would not be there They'll not be doing the work they are doing One was a nurse One became a teacher One became a trader and so on and this part of development and also they're developing the nation So this is the sort of thing we are teaching them and again we believe that we have to portray the women in a more positive manner that somebody might say that oh if the husband was beating her and so on she should have stayed in there She just went away toprostitute herself but she didn't She worked very hard with her children \n<$B> The books published by the Kenya Women Literature Group are sold through women's groups either to the group or to individuals\n<$A> If we sell them to the women as a group then the chairman of the group keeps them and other members come and borrow them just for paying a shilling  They pay a shilling and take the book and we have found that children and men borrow these books more than women and in this way we are starting what is known as home library and this is very useful especially during the holidays The children come borrow the books return them Whatever money which is collected is used to buy another book and mind you these books are in the local languages The first volume is in ten languages We have a book in Gikuyu in Luo in Kamba in Taita in Kisii in Maasai in uh eh Gikuyu in Kalenjin English and Kiswahili Those are ten books So women speaking these languages can pick up any book and they are also cheap We are selling those books only for twenty-five Kenya shillings per book\n<$B> Is that representative enough of all the languages spoken in Kenya or do you intend to move onto other \n<$A> Oh we intend to move on We even have a translation in Embu in Turkana and in uh Meru What we are waiting for What we are looking for is money Immediately we get a little money we use it to publish a book in any language because we want as many women as possible to read these books and uh of course uh we will continue Uh we hope that all women will have stories ready to tell We will start branches everywhere in Kenya so that we can have them in regions and we hope this will also sensitise the women they will learn go more to adult literacy classes If we find that there is another a group has got another literacy class then that group gets five books free of charge from us to encourage them to learn to read\n<$B> Is there anything you can do maybe to assist those women who don't have literacy groups and uh they should be reading your books\n<$A> We encourage them Those who don't have  when they meet they get one of them who can read to read the stories for them and then they have discussions \nS1BINT7K\n\n<$B> It might in the sense that if you lump them together with the critics of the day uh who made the day during the cabanistic era \n<$A> Yes\n<$B> they might have very well said well we can't touch that\n<$A> You see we have reached a stage when we must accept where we have to accept that we were colonised and having been colonised you know the use of English language is a consequence of that colonisation If I begin to write in my mother tongue and I have tried by the way uh with the you know some difficulties but again the readership is such that they would rather read me in English for some strange reason than in Ki-Maragoli\n<$B> So a writer does respond to the needs of society \n<$A> Exactly \n<$B> Rather than his own inner needs\n<$A> Yes a writer has to uh respond to the demands of his audience But at the same time he can cautiously try and alter those demands And so uh I'm challenged to continue writing occasionally in my mother tongue uh because I want to alter the attitudes of my writers particularly the young writers So when I write in my mother tongue it is for children \n<$B> Uh perhaps then that takes us into this area of uh literature in the school curriculum\n<$A> Right\n<$B> Today I understand it is trendy to talk about integration of language and literature What exactly is this integration\n<$A> I think there is a false notion that uh if you integrate uh English the study of English language with uh literature the two will enforce one another But you see what the proponents of this school of thought are forgetting is that literature serves a larger objective than that Literature uh helps us to try and understand other communities And we want to learn Caribbean literature We want to learn uh oral literature We want to learn other peoples' literatures and so on We should never uh fall into the pit of appending our literature to a certain language discipline It is wrong\n<$B> It doesn't appear as if it is a threat to literature departments within Kenya for example within Africa in the sense that language is threatening uh to take away the place of literature in the curriculum\n<$A> I don't think that scholars who want the two disciplines separated are feeling threatened and uh that their jobs will be taken when the merger takes effect \n<$B> Or is it it in fact because the writer in Kenya the writer in the developing world forgot how old they were They are hardly forty years old I think independence in this country in the context of development is hardly forty years old \n<$A> Yeah but what would that be have to do with the integration of English and \n<$B> Well I'm coming to that The point is that the writer then took on literature as a tool for sensitising people in directions that were counter the established expected \n<$B> In our own context it is very true that the writer saw his own role as I said earlier in the context of a little god sitting there in judgement and therefore it's one way of ensuring that we give our kids literature that is meaningful literature that is good literature that is meant to educate them not literature that leads them into that rebellious role of a writer seen around walking in rags and walking in bathroom slippers and whatever \n<$A> So are you suggesting that the advocation of foreign literature is to help our children know how to live as our children\n<$B> No I I'm saying that uh prescription is good\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> And these are little minds\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> They should be taught what is good what is desired\n<$A> What is good for the Kenyan child is first and foremost Kenyan literature That is what is good for the Kenyan child Not any of these foreign literatures that are flooding uh our market for children's literature and being endorsed by some officials\n<$B> And yet you are the first to agree that a writer should write in a language they are most comfortable in\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> One of the criticisms that does arise is the fact that a lot of what is being written today is being written in a language that is not complementing the student in school and hence the need to prescribe texts\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> that expose students to a language that uh is as near native as possible\n<$A> Yeah but don't forget that English is a language of instruction in Kenya\n<$B> It is a language of the colonial master\n<$A> In Kenyan schools It is a language of the colonial master But I believe we have the instruments to manipulate this language to our best possible use If West Africans can do it why shouldn't we do it They created a pidgin which has given them national confidence And that's why I like the <ea/>sheng that is developing now\n<$B> Do you have any <ea/>sheng in your own works\n<$A> No but in the next one there will be You know because you see <ea/>sheng has given those young fellows the confidence they want They can manipulate this language and they can add on to it every passing day But you see with us we are so rigid rigidly adhered to the Queen's language that\n<$B> Received Pronunciation\n<$A> Yeah yeah\n<$B> That's right\n<$A> Yes so that you make a little mistake and you want to go and commit suicide\n<$B> But aren't you a believer a firm believer in uh this general adage that if you must do anything you should do it well\n<$A> Of course\n<$B> And if you must speak English then I'm not saying I should speak English like uh the Queen but at least I should try to speak English in the proper way\n<$A> I've been trying\n<$B> If I speak Kimaragoli or if I speak Kikikuyu or whatever it is I should speak it well\n<$A> Yes but speaking it well doesn't necessarily mean communicating well in it The Queen's English I have been told by those experts is the worst English according to them\n<$B> Well I think that is something that writers in this country need to get together and do something about I think they feel or they must surely be constrained by this question of language What about your own books What message were you trying to communicate in your own books and what books are these Which of those books that you have done so far do you consider your masterpiece\n<$A> Well I've published Right now I have published thirteen books twelve plays and one novel plus a novella which is in Kimaragoli which I talked about Yeah this is uh Shrine of Tears which is uh my latest uh publication and it is a novel my first novel\n<$B> Well let's just go down the line Time doesn't quite allow but I would like you to tell the viewers when you wrote what book and what it said very briefly and uh why you turned from being a dramatist a playwright to a novelist all of a sudden\n<$A> Well I first published uh a play called The Fourth Trial in nineteen seventy-two when I was an undergraduate student at the University of Nairobi I soon followed that with uh The Married Bachelor uh in nineteen seventy-three Both plays uh were addressing the whole question of cultural alienation the aping of foreign values uh within our African uh environment And then I followed that up with Betrayal in the City which as you know people call it political but I think that Betrayal in the City is removed from formal politics It deals with social politics you know and it's enditing corruption and uh true uh corruption immorality and all related uh evils in society I've also written a play called The Successor which deals with the whole question of political succession I'm very worried about political succession on the African continent and the infighting that goes before it Uh and The Successor articulates that Then we have Game of Silence which uh I wrote basically because of the style the absurdist approach to dramatic construction That was an experimentation Uh I have a sequel to Betrayal in the City This is called Man of Kafir Man of Kafir examines the whole question of the exiled African leader When he is in exile does he reflect upon the evils the ills he used to RRR reach out against his own subjects Does he reform and so on Then finally and most interesting is a play called Aminata which incidentally has very accurately it was published in nineteen eighty-eight but now has accurately predicted what is happening right now the formulation of new laws to govern uh the inheritance of women to property and so on So I'm quite excited about what is happening now in relation to what's articulated in Aminata \n<$B> Well I think the subject of what you have done and what you are yet to do uh is a a RRR contentious one \n<$A> Right\n<$B> It is something that we would need a lot of time to delve into But I would like to wish you success especially in your new endeavour to become a novelist\n<$A> Thank you \n<$B> Uh uh I look forward to talking in detail about your particular publications Viewers we have been talking to Professor Francis Imbuga who is a Dean of the Faculty of Arts at Kenyatta University College Kenyatta University\n<$A> Kenyatta University \n<$B> I'm sorry Kenyatta University Thank you very much Until next time it's goodbye from us \n\n<$A> Doctor Okello briefly maybe you can tell us how Kenya Consumers Organisation was formed and why it was formed \n<$B> Well uh thank you very much <name/> uh I would gladly repeat that We've said it so many times and uh maybe now it will become uh the common to a lot of consumers who a lot of Kenyans who listen to us in this programme uh Essentially Kenyan Consumers Organisation was formed to provide the consumers with not only the information about activities in the market place prices of commodities compare them from one shop to another from one market to another and make life a little easier for the consumers who participate in the market place to know where they can get uh goods and services according to what they uh have uh in the form of incomes and so on Again give them the information that was necessary to participate to make decisions effective decisions in the market place out of definite knowledge about the various products and services that are being sold or bought in the market place And so it grew out of those specific concerns that from uh at the moment we are concerned about essentially the same consumer We are concerned about the consumer's protection uh regarding his rights and there are quite a quite a handful of those rights One of the very basic ones is the right to information the right to education in order to make him or her uh effective in decision making effective in the market place uh when he decides on the basis of information and knowledge to uh buy or sell consume a service or a particular product knowing the consequences knowing positive and negative consequences of his action in the market place\n<$A> Who is the consumer\n<$B> uh A consumer is literally everybody Institutions government employees government departments individuals individual Kenyans and non-Kenyans and uh they are not just consuming food They are consuming services They are consuming environment and so on So when we talk about consumers in this country we are not identifying our movement with respect to a particular group of people In fact our office is dealing with people ranging from disabled people individuals poor rich if you like businessmen government departments and so on So as far as we are concerned there is no discrimination when it comes to consumer movement in this country or in any other country for that matter Consumerism is such a wide concept now that everybody is consuming some thing or another And everybody that consumes something or another has the right or certain rights\n<$A> Doctor Okello you mentioned somewhere that uh one of the major things that a consumer has a right to is information and education And uh given that the whole concept almost the whole concept of uh the existence of the Kenya Consumers Organisation is to uh educate people where they are ignorant Maybe you can enumerate on how somebody is entitled or has a right to both information and education without compromising uh whatever he's having  equally himself\n<$B> Well let me start by uh a simple example If you're sick you go to a doctor and the doctor gives you a piece of paper which we call a prescription and you go to uh a shop chemist shop to buy the medicine The person that mixes it up will read the doctor's description and give you medicine At that time you are sick There's a particular illness and you are prescribed to swallow or to eat or to chew or to suck a particular type of medicine Then when that medicine is being given to you there are quite a number of things that are taking place at that moment The doctor has decided that a particular type of medicine is the best in terms of curing your illness These medicines have certain chemical combinations Your body as human body also has certain chemical combinations and through his training the doctor can tell or he is supposed to be able to tell that if you take this particular medicine it will combine in a particular way so that the ailment you're suffering from is reduced or removed completely and that that particular medicine because it is it was made up of out of certain chemical combinations is likely to react to your body in a number of ways So as a consumer you have the right to know that if I swallow this pill what are some of the reactions that I'm likely to get initially or eventually What are the eventual consequences When I get well is my skin going to remain with certain swelling or what And then on that particular on the label or rather on that particular bottle where the medicine is uh you're expected to know as a consumer that this particular medicine has certain chemical combinations that are active what they call active ingredients and these ought to be labelled \n<$A> properly \nS1BINT8K\n<$A> The question that comes to mind Abdul every time I talk about Elvis is I don't know how the record buying public uh coped with Elvis I'm talking of his records his uh releases because the first few records we've played It's all right mama Heartbreak Hotel Hound Dog Don't be cruel and Love me tender these were all hits and every other time before you're thinking of something else there is Elvis with a new hit and it's just hitting the charts all over the world \n<$B> You see the case of Elvis is uh coming uh coming uh at the right time You see he came at the right time people were hungry People were you know there was so much happening in the Americas then and the people were yearning for entertainment and good entertainment so here is one person who came trying to unify with his music and uh people were really yearning so they could take it because uh imagine from nineteen fifty-four up to nineteen fifty-six or fifty-seven there were so many releases one after the other so you can call every other month there was something out from Elvis and everything was a golden hit \n<$C> Indeed and something perhaps I'm not sure I think he's uh probably the artist who's released most records today and which became hits in the world \n<$B> To date yah he stands a check with the Guinness book of records of course \n<$A> Now a question Abdul In today's Elvis is one idol who's been accepted all through you're talking of the young and the older generation The young who never knew Elvis today in uh people going out on clubs when a number of Elvis is played the whole uh you'll find a bigger number will stand up to go and dance to it They had some types that there's something about his music that pulled the public out to go and dance it out\n<$B> That's it You've answered my question because you know you sit back in a club or anywhere in any performance and uh when Elvis comes on stage you know like uh if you're watching the movie and there is a clip of Elvis and you find everybody going crazy you know If you are in a club and somebody plays uh maybe the old rock and roll you know Rock around the Clock blah blah blah but when somebody comes up with a hit of Elvis Presley everybody <O/>even the sixteen eighteen years old because there is some touch in this music you know uh it is like a <O/> touch some magical touch that for generations and generations Elvis will still live on \n<$A> Let's move away from Elvis uh at his time Elvis Presley there are other rock groups I'm talking probably of the sixties when Beatles now were coming up Mickey Jaggers and all that Was there a lot of competition about that time Chuck Berry you know like we said uh\n<$B> Yah people like Chuck Berry really they were not uh much of competition Beatles Beatles are Beatles When Beatles came up uh I think even Elvis himself felt uh the impact of the Beatles But he survived through the Beatles\n<$C> One thing about the Beatles is they had to perform in America to try and get a feel of what Elvis uh I mean what the public uh views and looks at Elvis Beatles had to travel all the way to America and make a performance to try and beat up Elvis \n<$B> Yah uh Beatles did try that but uh did they They didn't So let's I think uh let's get to little bit of more music some more information March nineteen fifty-seven Elvis purchases uh the world famous Graceland This is the place which has been termed like a historic monument for him April June nineteen fifty-seven uh he released one of the greatest singles All Shook Up and he uh stayed there between eight to seven weeks in the US and UK charts So let's listen to All Shook Up \n<$C> When you talk about music there are a couple of people you mentioned Louis Armstrong uh jazz you talk of Elvis Presley on rock <O/> Jackson on spirituals and gospel Something that to today nobody has tried to take that title from uh Elvis the King of Rock and Roll It's not happened yet\n<$B> it's not happened and I don't understand why really I don't understand why because there are so many great uh you know rock artists who were coming and going coming and fading but nobody seems to be in today's music you see uh in fact from the seventies nobody seems to be coming with an impact except for Michael you know Michael has created an impact but you know Michael now what does Michael do Michael is into R and B Michael is into rock Michael is into plastic music So you know the title is still uh it's like Otis Redding's title R and B It's still There is no other single of uh rhythm and blues the same with rock and roll the same with Cliff Richard Who has replaced Cliff Richard till today the Beatles Who has replaced the Beatles \n<$A> That's true uh Abdul let me take you back did Elvis have any other members of his family apart from mother and father Did he have brothers and sisters \n<$B> No not really uh He had uh he was born There were twins actually He was uh he had Jessie <O/> uh his uh other twin brother but it was a still-born baby So he was all alone and uh I strongly believe any uh many people say it's uh Priscilla uh who created uh Elvis into a wreck Some people say apologies to those uh who are really Elvis fanatics Some say it's the drugs I don't believe it's the drugs really but I feel it's the loneliness of his mother because you know if you read some of his older magazines some of his older movies if you watch you'll find him talking to somebody in uh like in one of the movies a reflection or what imagining that it's his brother Jessie <O/> He was he was a lonely person and then he turned to his mother you know and when the mother went away this man never recovered and gave all the love to Priscilla and when she went away he never recovered again So Elvis really he had everything in the world but uh I don't think Elvis had happiness \n<$C> That's true and one thing like you said he gave love and he gave love to the kids and he gave love to the public uh He gave back to the public what they gave him and one time I read about Elvis bought about uh I can't remember what car was but then that car was a sport car very expensive car and probably one of the few people who owned it Going out into the he visited a supermarket or something and when he was walking back to the car he find somebody admiring his car and uh uh he <O/> the gentleman he says you mean you own this car he says yeah but now it's yours and he gives him the key Just gave it away\n<$B> Yah it's true and there is so much there is during this performance uh on stage uh This was from the movie uh Well That's the way it is one of the ushers admired his ring and he just take the diamond the multi-million diamond Take it It's all yours He was very generous He gave so much to the world but what did the world give to him What did his bodyguards give to him What did his associates give to him They wrecked him You know some one of his bodyguards went out and uh went as far as I think marrying the ex-wife The others went making money out of him writing books with all sorts of uh accusations and allegations and all that so this is the world we are living in you know You give so much to the world but what is the world going to give in return So this man died according to me a very unhappy man and he led a very lonely life really Okay let's go down to a little music then we come back to that uh subject Nineteen fifty-seven July his second motion picture Loving You was released uh in the US and featured there this legendary Let Me Be Your Teddy Bear Let Me Be Your Teddy Bear and uh of course uh the ladies of course with every artist the ladies go crazy and you had all these teddy bears everybody clinging to their teddy bear And here he was Let him be your Teddy Bear I don't want to be a tiger nor anything else just your teddy bear You tell me who won't accept such an artist\n<$C> Indeed and Elvis talking about his performances <O/>like I mentioned earlier there are performances if you attended one of them it's something you'll never forget uh in your life \n<$B> Johnny let me ask you something since we are talking I think we are half way through the through the programme I know you are trying to be a bit uh very cautious in this particular programme because the last programme we did uh many of the so-called local artists and DJs kind of said why was Huck <O/> so hard-hitting to us Let me ask you a question because you are regularly here I come uh I'm a commercial man now I come occasionally Why don't the DJs of today feature artists like this \n<$C> Ah well they done I think Abdul  don't <O/> this programme with you man .But like you say it's probably the artist not the artist but the public out there probably the DJs <O/> what the uh public out there want them to play for them \n<$B> How much uh public really you think honestly you tell me who would not want to listen to Elvis Is the public the publicRRR going to listen to bata bata bata bata throughout uh There is Beatles there is Chuck Berry there is Chubby Checker there is so many uh Charlie Pride This kind of music I think we are lacking it today \n<$A> Indeed now Abdul talking about uh uh you saying of the Elvis and many other artists Let's talk about his airplay Today he still gets airplay all over the world is that true \n<$B> All over the world he still gets airplay Especially on the on the twenty-second of uh August That's his death anniversary All over the world there is a special programme uh some special clippings you could have watched uh CNN uh during this anniversary But I don't know anyway I think we are talking about Elvis today Let's not heat on anybody but I feel uh we should feature such great artists Otis Aretha Franklin Percy Sledge on and off in our programme because in parties it happens when you go to a party you listen to such music \n<$C> Indeed Abdul uh a few weeks ago a month probably but I think about three weeks ago there were uh they discovered some unreleased material of Elvis Presley uh numbers that have not been heard before and probably that they'll be out in the market soon What did you think of that discovery \n<$B> I just followed it through the papers I just read it through the papers and it was all over the world that some unreleased uh material has been located in his library some uh some in the studios And we're all waiting to see what kind of uh material that was and why was it not released at that particular time and if it is going to be released today is it going to have the same impact Or maybe it will be sympathy buying or maybe it will be as good as what people are waiting for today and then we have a resurrection of Elvis Presley \n<$A> Let's go back to his performances Abdul just for a while uh in his performances uh cities towns uh villages will all come to a standstill when uh Elvis\n<$B> the king is in town \n<$A> yes everything will come to a standstill I mean that showed how loved he was by the public \nS1BINT9K\n<$A> Welcome to our environment a programme that focuses on environmental development This week world habitat day to be celebrated on second October nineteen ninety-five World habitat day each year provides a chance to look back at the progress made in the previous one year and to look ahead set goals and make plans for the future I talk to Mr Agu Okali the director of the office of the executive director to the assistant secretary general of habitat He tells us on the theme of this year world habitat day\n<$B> Uh Lucy the uh theme of uh world habitat day for nineteen ninety-five is our neighbourhood\n<$A> Why did uh you choose our neighbourhood with uh a significant reason for it\n<$B> Uh yes uh normally uh world habitat day tries to focus on a particular theme for each year This gives the countries uh a uh reference point for organising their observances and uh this year we have chosen our neighbourhood because we believe that the uh salvation of uh our cities towns and villages must start in the very smallest uh units which is the neighbourhood\n<$A> And now uh did you probably relate that you're having the city summit probably that's what I was thinking maybe that is why you specifically chose our neighbourhood so that we can prepare ourselves for the meeting\n<$B> Uh yes uh the way we make the <O/> is that uh it is in the uh neighbourhood that uh one begins to uh uh operate as a citizen citizen of the community with responsibilities and rights as well and that these values of uh civic responsibility are the values that will actually uh enable us to address problems of larger uh the larger community We begin from the neighbourhoods and then we move this into the larger city big city setting and uh as you've just uh mentioned all the uh uh main focus of one of the two uh main uh uh points of focus of the conference the major UN conference that is going to take place next year uh called the uh habitat twoconference is exactly the idea of cities in the coming uh century so the neighbourhood idea is one that we start from the neighbourhood and move to the larger city\n<$A> Now uh I'm sure every uh town every country is going to have a specific place where to celebrate the day but the UN must have set a particular region a particular uh place for the celebrations\n<$B> Uh yes uh Lucy what we do is that uh over the years we have been more or less rotating the locale of the global observance for world habitat day uh last year for example it was in Africa in Dakar Senegal this year it's going to be in Latin America in Curitaba Brazil \n<$A> Now uh uh as we had mentioned earlier on about the preparation for the uh city summit in Taki and you'd been having quite a number of uh meeting going on I'm sure this is all for preparation but what is the feeling of habitat Do you think you are really uh gearing towards the city summit uh in July on transport and communication and other themes that you'd been having\n<$B> Uh yes we are uh very uh gratified that the response that uh we have received uh from countries all over the world uh in their preparatory activities for the uh city summit uh the habitat two conference and uh some of the meetings are actually sponsored by us but most of them uh not They're the initiatives of uh uh uh uh uh countries and organisations and uh municipalities uh each in each of the meeting or workshop or seminar we try to relate the theme to what is going to happen or be discussed in Istanbul and uh we try to extract from each meeting a lesson which uh would be incorporated in some of the recommendation for the habitat two conference for example uh one of the uh uh meetings that we all conducted uh this transport and communication uh workshop uh in Singapore uh that you just mentioned uh turned out to be a very uh illuminating conference uh because the experts there came to uh a very interesting and you know surprising uh conclusion from our point of view uh prior to the uh this meeting uh there was an idea that the way for example to look with transport issues and transport <O/> which as you know is a major problem in all the cities of the world particular in developing countries was to build more roads create more infrastructure uh and then you know uh that was supposed uh to solve the problem or help solve it but it was discovered that that is not the case that it is more important to control demand to try to create other ways than simply expanding the infrastructure because the experience of countries that have concentrated on controlling the demand and uh creating other options than motor car for example uh that those countries have done better than those that simply widened the roads you know created more uh infrastructure for transport So this is one of the lessons that uh uh we are going to bring to the meeting in Istanbul\n<$A> Now uh I'm a bit worried of uh other countries that maybe I do know how you're going to talk of the issue of war in most of the countries right now let's take for example in Sarajevo and the other countries' civil war Here again we are preparing for the city summit How are you planning to talk with such cases\n<$B> Uh this a very good point uh Lucy because uh the issue of uh of uh disaster what we call disaster uh management and uh disaster prevention and the this these disasters are not just natural disasters but human-made disasters like wars and civil strife Is one that we are uh giving a great deal of prominence to in uh preparations for Istanbul because as you have just mentioned uh uh wars are the biggest in fact destroyers of uh human settlements of what we are trying to build and uh our executive director Dr Ndao has uh uh uh launched an initiative where he is trying to get uh member states to see civil strife wars and destruction as actually a very important component of uh of the uh issues of human settlements in the past they were not uh they were separated uh one was dealt with as a peace-keeping or peace-making type of activity as a political activity whereas this was more a developmental What we now see is there is a very uh strong linkage between this and uh as a specific example at one of the preparatory meetings that uh we uh organised for habitat two conference which took place in uh in Brazaville Congo all the African ministers who adopted the uh charter dealing specifically with the issues of uh these wars inRRR in Africa and the effect on human settlements\n<$A> How about the natural disasters the typhoons that come sometimes in the year and clear cities\n<$B> yes we have uh as a <O/> we have uh uh uh ourselves established uh a unit in within Habitat that uh addresses uh addresses this uh uh this kinds of problems uh we Habitat has uh had uh long uh history uh of uh of being uh uh offering technical uh expertise uh and technical support to countries uh that have been enough affected by natural disasters as well as man-made disasters as we have said and uh we uh uh are giving uh increasing emphasis to this uh in our work programme\n<$A> Now uh <O/> at wild uh they specifically give uh some uh awards to the people who have played a greater role or rather recognise them for their good work they have done for the environment I don't know if you have that in uh habitat and if not if you're preparing to have such a kind of awards\n<$B> Yes uh we do have awards that are given uh you know uh on world habitat day to recognise uh uh countries as well as individuals and organisations that have made a uh uh recognisable contribution to human settlements' development We have basically uh for world habitat day we have uh two uh categories of awards we have uh the main world habitat uh uh awards which are two prizes uh usually one from a developing country one developed country and these uh prizes uh they're cash prizes as well as uh trophies and they're awarded uh uh to specific projects that are considered uh uh uh either ground breaking or to have a very uh significant uh uh lesson for other countries And these uh those uh awards are sponsored by uh a British uh foundation uh called Building and Sociohousing Foundation Uh in addition to these uh two main awards we have a habitat <O/> of honour uh which is uh this is organised uh by and sponsored by habitat itself and uh in there we recognise uh again individuals and uh organisations that have uh made significant contributions to human settlements' development\n<$A> Now finally Mr Okali what do you plan of the habitat two\n<$B> Uh that's uh that's an interesting question uh because uh I say this because uh uh there are two in a sense two trends of uh opinion uh one uh one is that uh we expect uh as an institution support by habitat two conference strengthened by you know by the recommendation of the conference Uh we have uh a different of view has been expressed by some member states or uh uh NGO organisations that want for example to see uh a different kind of institution uh created or entrusted with responsibility of uh implementing uh uh the recommendations of habitat two but uh I will say that uh uh we do expect uh <O/> habitat to come out uh much stronger as uh UN uh institution responsible for this area but more importantly uh Lucy is that we do expect uh and want countries to uh take seriously the recommendations and decisions that emerged from the conference and actually implement these to uh improve human settlements' conditions in on the ground and in their own countries because that's the main objective of the entire exercise\n<$A> Mr Agu Okali of habitat And as we celebrate the world habitat day habitat is preparing for the habitat two conference in Taki well known as the city summit Madam Christina Egfeld is chief of information and external relation United Nations centre for human settlement habitat She tells us about the preparations \n<$C>\n<$A> Now uh probably you can also tell us how far the information has been going have people been getting enough information about the Habitat Two Conference you being the chief of information and external relation and you see normally most people end up complaining that oh we didn't know about the coming meeting and so on how far has you know habitat been doing about it\nS1BINT0K\n<$A> Archives are past or retired records of a given institution that are being appraised and preserved because of their enduring values Now the values of records are of two categories namely the primary values and the secondary values Primary primarily records are instruments of administration and they are initially created and preserved for that purpose or reason In other word records are by-products of human activity and they are part and parcels of man's functions and transactions involving him in that they contain the necessary information that makes it possible for man to carry out his responsibilities in a proper and consisted consistent manner But with the passage of time records acquire values other than administrative They become tools of research in history sociology political science and geneology These values acquired in the cause of time are what we refer to as secondary values \nNow the National Museum of Kenya Archives: The National Museum of Kenya decided to set up an archives programme in nineteen eighty whose main responsibilities are organising preserving and providing reference service on past records to members of staff and to bonafide research scholars The programme also aims at acquiring private papers and documents of individual persons particularly scientists and organisations which have a direct or indirect bearing on the functioning and activities of the National Museums of Kenya The museum runs a centralised archive system in which case all past documents are concentrated at the headquarters Nairobi uh that means even those belonging to regional museums The museum has modern storage facilities such as air-conditioned rooms and so on that ensure proper keeping conditions for the documents so that these documents arrive for use not only in the ongoing research and other functions of the museum but also for posterity \n<$B> Nairobi This week we're visiting the archives department and the head of the department Mr Gideon Mtwala is telling us more about the archives I'm just wondering where does it begin You as the head of the department what do you really do \n<$A> My job actually is to oversee and supervise the functions of the department by seeing to it that uh records are systematically retired to the depository of the national archives uh to the National Museum's Archives and again to see that uh some of the materials which were taken away by our colonial administrators during the time when we were about to receive independence uh we get copies and fill the gaps that have been missing\n<$B> Now who decides on what should be archived\n<$A> Uh me uh plus the administrators uh and this is based on the history of the materials to be archived and this comes in with the time Because records assume historical significance with the passage of time\n<$B> How old is your oldest uh\n<$A> My\n<$B> material archived\n<$A> The oldest material archived that I have uh dates back to about eighteen ninety-six\n<$B> And what's this\n<$A> These are records to do with the national parks at the coast which were housed at Fort Jesus uh by John Clark\n<$B> now how big is your department How many of you are there\n<$A> Uh my department at the moment consists of four people uh two of which are now on training at the Kenya Polytechnic\n<$B> Do they have uh subjects about archives at the Kenya Polytechnic\n<$A> Yes uh the Kenya Polytechnic has a programme on records management and archives administration uh course\n<$B> What about uh other universities\n<$A> We do also have uh Moi University which has established a Faculty of Information and uh other science related uh courses do they have <O/> got\n<$B> Now tell us about types of records at the National Museums of Kenya Mr Mtwala\n<$A> Now the bulk of the archives in the museum collections are mainly official papers such as correspondences minutes and other proceedings of the various meetings and reports plus photographs and films covering the museum functions and activities\n<$B> Now we move on to what you had lined up for us to hear today in the programme\n<$A> Yes uh before I proceed I would like to point out here that uh the earliest collection of museum records were transferred to the Kenya National Archives long before the museum established its own archive programme\n<$B> You didn't tell us who came with the idea of starting the archives at the National Museum did you\n<$A> Not yet uh It was uh although it was uh the programme of archives was only established in nineteen eighty the idea of setting up an archive programme had long been felled matter of fact it was felled uh uh in the middle of nineteen sixties when uh most of the research scientists and the museum workers felt that most of the documented evidence in the museum had a lot of information which needed to be organised and be preserved so that it could serve uh the ongoing functions and at same time so that this part of history could be transmitted into the future So the idea of setting up this programme was felled long before the programme was started In addition to these official records the following private papers are being deposited in the archives of the National Museums Papers of A.K. <name/> and private papers of A.M. Champion and also private papers of Louis S.P. Leakey and others and also the most popular collection which is the tribal and botanical paintings and photographs of Joy Adamson Many people have asked me the question regarding the relationship between archives department of the Kenya National Museum and the Kenya National Archives Department Well the two are indeed closely related The Kenya National Archives looks after all the past's documentation and records of the republic of Kenya while the archives of the National Museum look after all the past documentation of the records uh all the past documentation of the National Museum Now the archives act gives them gives the Kenya National Archives Department jurisdiction over all past records created in Kenya on the other hand the museum archives programme takes care only of the museum past documentation and those other papers from private individuals which are relevant to the functions of the National Museum But the museum undertakes its programme of archives within the framework of the same act that is the National Archives Act What that what this means is that the museum and other institutions with archives must send lists of their archival collection to the Kenya National Archives so that the latter is informed of the whereabouts of this valuable information This way the Kenya National Archives can then direct users who visit them to relevant places as the case may be\n<$B> Listeners today we talked about the archives of the National Museums of Kenya and heading the department having talked to us is Mr Gideon Mtwali Next week we shall be moving on to the library department of the National Museums of Kenya in our series know your museums Until then this is Elizabeth Omolo Have a good week \n<$A> \n<$B> Mr Mashetti Masinshula the secretary of the Kenya Oral Literature Association\n<$A> In African societies there was no role conflict between the male and the female sex We put this to the KOLA secretary Mr Mashetti Masinshula\n<$B> First I wouldn't agree that there is no conflict in African society between the male and female gender There's a lot of evidence for example in the field we're dealing with in oral literature of conflict in narratives in myths In myths from certain societies you find that there is always some kind of conflict Men overthrowing women Women agitating for something here and there so I think there is that conflict latent in our societies But why gender now I think the emphasis on gender at the moment has been precipitated by the kind of changes experienced in the modern society We realise that men cannot uh they cannot keep up with the so called traditional roles that they were specialised in initially Society has changed so much that in fact some of the traditional roles let's look at the role of men as warriors do not apply in the modern society There is the police uh there are watchmen who could do that kind of job So men have to take on new tasks which they're been competed with the same tasks are being competed for by women and this calls for some kind of harmonising roles at least finding a way of restoring harmony since men feel that women are infiltrating in their traditional places so uh getting into area that they thought were not meant for them\n<$A> Now one of the basic reasons for oral literature studies is to preserve unwritten cultural norms Now how has this role been affected by this changing nature of society with the development of say writing and the Western influence\n<$B> I think the development of writing has uh given rise to a situation where most of the oral narratives can now be recorded and with the disadvantage that uh you get a version of an oral narrative which looks like the correct one and this in a sense appears to be killing the oral culture where people tell stories and that kind of thing Also the modern changes have made it impossible for the traditional society which used to give rise to a lot of story-telling a lot of observation of what is going on around people and it has meant that uh the new technologies have to react also in a new way to oral material For example we're trying to adapt to modern technology through use of television uh for example recording certain aspects of oral performances on video uh recording them on cassettes also writing books about them I think we're trying to keep up with the modern changes but uh the modern changes have definitely affected the ground on which oral literature was used to survive\n<$A> In that present we have a sharp conflict between African tradition and uh Western tradition Now basically the West is winning How are you reacting to this cultural trend\n<$B> I wouldn't say there is a sharp contrast I think what has been happening is gradually the African tradition has been adjusting not in a systematic manner to the kind of modern changes uh The way the adjustment had has not been has not been smooth as I'd pointed out earlier uh there are a lot of pitfalls Part of it is because we don't know what new identity to take upon uh I wouldn't emphasise the fact of conflict because somehow people seem to be getting along I think given time given a lot of thoughts given some research and just practical adjustment to the kind of changes we're experiencing and also our own research into our past so that we can know what to preserve within the traditions and how just to adapt uh some harmony will be struck and we'll have something not Western but maybe an adaptation of Western plus our own African traditions\n<$A> Now if you look at the whole stock of the culture that is coming in It's from different parts of the world We have from uh from Europe from America from very many other parts of the world and uh looking at the tradition we see that we are having specified and uh limited kind of uh tradition that we are addressing ourselves to Don't you think that the just in terms of numbers the great number of cultures which are coming in will submerge that one of our own\n<$B> Uh culture has a way of absorbing a lot of uh cultural trace from other cultures and somehow finding a way of not being completely submerged I think there are certain things about the African tradition that the other cultures we're exposed to will not completely do away with uh I think what we'll have in the end is a synthesis of those cultures and our African tradition but not the complete disappearance of African tradition", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'e569955e-e847-4ced-8cfd-b40818aa1550', 'added':

{'text': "<$C> Face the Mike This is a weekly question and answer session on national and international issues Cotton is the world's leading textile fibre  accounting for about fifty per cent of the global textile market The annual consumption of cotton as a textile raw material is about sixty million bales the equivalent of fourteen million tons Tanzania is among the seventy-five countries which produce cotton in the world The large majority of world cotton producers are developing countries who have of late become consumers of their own raw cotton due to their rapidly expanding textile industries Yet as is the case with Tanzania cotton is one of the highly placed foreign exchange earners for developing countries Also according to official statistics cotton consumption in producer countries has more than tripled from two million tons between nineteen fifty and nineteen fifty-one to six million tons in the year nineteen seventy-four seventy-five Therefore most of textile industries of the developing world have home grown cotton available as raw material in abundant supply and at low cost However developing countries like Tanzania are facing a number of problems in their efforts to meet local and export needs of cotton The cotton industry in Tanzania has for many years been affected by such problems as failure to gin the crop and transportation but according to the general manager of the  Tanzanian Cotton Authority <ea/>Ndugu Magnus Mdope a lot of effort is being made to improve ginneries and to eliminate other bottlenecks This is undoubtedly only part of the responsibilities of the Tanzania Cotton Authority which are elaborated further by <ea/>Ndugu Mdope in this week's Face the Mike interview with Radio Tanzania's <name/> Mahmood\n<$B>  Tanzanian Cotton Authority was established way back in nineteen seventy-three as a corporate authority charged with the responsibility of promoting cotton production in this country Actually its history emanates from the former <O/> marketing board which was charged with the responsibility of uh marketing cotton both internally and externally and in nineteen seventy-two with the decentralisation of the government machinery it was decided to form by this group authorities and as for cotton TCA was formed\n<$A> uh Let's now uh come back to uh this week you call Cotton Week What is the significance of the week\n<$B> Well the significance of this uh cotton week is uh that uh this year for the first time we'll be having an international conference on cotton uh in Arusha uh both the International Cotton Advisory Committee and the International Institute for Cotton will be having their plenary sessions in Tanzania and we thought uh it  would be a good idea if we if the public had some idea of what these institutions uh are all about\n<$A> uh Are there any other activities you're going to show in this week or you'll be only informing the public about the two international conferences in Arusha\n<$B> Well we'll be talking mainly about those two uh international bodies and uh as usual the members of the public would like to know what's going on and we thought it  would be a good idea if we could have uh a session whereby we could talk a little bit about cotton in Tanzania and internationally\n<$A> What efforts are you putting to encourage cotton growers in the country \n<$B> Well that is a question which is being handled both by TCA in consultation with the government and as you know over the last couple of years production in Tanzania of cotton has stagnated around uh three hundred thousand bales whereas if you remember early in the sixties our production had gone up to almost half a million bales and what we've been trying to do is uh put emphasis on uh extension services by making sure that the farmers adhere to recommended practices of proper growing of cotton and uh other incentives which have been taken uh have been uh by way of increase in producer prices and increased efficiency in the processing and handling of the crop as a whole \n<$A> uh What is the main reason  for the decrease of production \n<$B> Well one of the main reasons for the decrease in cotton production has been that uh you see most of this cotton in Tanzania is grown in the lake zone and uh there we have the problem of uh drought over a couple of years and uh this has had an adverse effect on the production of food crops Now cotton being an annual crop normally when the time comes for planting farmers tend to uh pay more attention to food crops than cotton and hence the decline in cotton production One other reason for this decline has been poor husbandry practices by the farmers\n<$A> and crop authorities in the country uh have been engaged in marketing of the crop instead of uh establishing their own estates or farms uh how do you foresee this problem \n<$B> Well it could be that question could be true in respect to several other authorities but as far as uh cotton authority is concerned uh in fact since nineteen seventy-four we started opening our own estates and as of today we have about uh fifteen estates scattered all over the country mainly in the eastern cotton growing areas in Morogoro uh Kilosa and Tanga region Kilimanjaro and Arusha and also in the western cotton growing areas we have some farms in Singida Shinyanga <name/> and Mwanza region and Kagera So I wouldn't agree with your question that we haven't been uh addressing ourselves to that kind of problem \n<$A> That's very good and uh now <ea/>Ndugu Mdope sometimes textile industry in the country complains of shortage of raw materials while cotton is piled up in the regions' go-downs What is TCA doing to alleviate this situation \n<$B> Well that problem has occurred mainly I'd say this year It's a very recent  phenomenon in the sense that in the past we used to have stocks to carry us through the season and this year because of the rehabilitation programme which is going on we had to stop our ginneries for maintenance some time in March and at that time we had stocks enough to last the local mills for about two months that's through to May and we thought uh given the fact that uh we would be having a new season by June we would have at least had uh enough cotton to keep them going starting from the new season Normally the mills are supposed to sort of close at least for a month uh to carry out some maintenance of their plants Now what happened uh particularly with respect to plants in Dar es Salaam uh French Textile Mill the their plants uh didn't tie with our plants and unfortunately it happened that they had to stop production some time in May but they resumed production immediately after a month and now things are more or less back to normal\n<$A> You mentioned about the rehabilitation programme How far have you gone on that one \n<$B> Well the rehabilitation programme uh has been going on for the last two and a half years now and it's funded by the Dutch government in co-operation with our government It's supposed to come to an end uh by mid next year and the plan was to rehabilitate about four hundred gins in the Western cotton-growing area Up to now we've managed to rehabilitate about three hundred and two gins and we hope to complete the task by June\n<$A> <ea/>Ndugu Mdope  in May this year you held uh had a workshop group  for cotton growers in the country uh What  was the purpose of that workshop and what came out of it \n<$B> Well the purpose of that workshop uh actually was to try and address ourselves to the problems uh affecting cotton production in this country given the fact that cotton is one of the major export commodities in Tanzania So we had uh various people from uh the party and the government from all cotton-growing regions assembled in Mwanza for a week and we discussed various problems which are affecting this production trend and one of the major issues which came out uh was that uh research seemed to be lagging behind uh production and extension also wasn't uh very well catered for and uh the government is now taking serious measures to try and rectify this situation\n<$A> And how about uh the peasants who are growing cotton What incentives are you giving to them \n<$B> We try to make sure that uh one the price the producer price it's uh adequately covers their costs and that there that it leaves also a margin for them to keep going uh We also try and impress upon various authorities to make sure that uh consumer goods are made available to these villages where cotton is grown uh We have examples whereby distribution systems have been uh a little bit uh unfair to cotton farmers in the sense that for example they grow cotton and one of the things which we always try and hammer home during our campaigns is that cotton it's good for making cooking oil and uh uh uh textiles etcetera Now when the farmers produce this stuff and they don't get these commodities then uh it's a little bit counterproductive What we're trying to do is uh try and impress upon the various authorities and make sure that these consumer goods are available to them and this is sinking into people's minds and it looks as if we are on an upwards swing again\n<$A> Yah and uh how about uh the competition in the world market How are we featuring \n<$B> Well  Tanzanian cotton actually apparently happens to be one of those uh uh uh fibres which is very much in the mind and normally we have always fetched premium prices on the market because our cotton it's uh hand-picked and roller-ginned which is uh an old  phenomenon Nowadays you know with mechanisation particularly in these big producing countries most of the uh harvesting and processing it's uh mechanised and you don't get the same quality type of cotton like you get from our country and uh in that respect we haven't had any problems in selling our cotton except only when uh the market has been flooded with just too much cotton as the case is the case this year then we find some uh uh downward trend uh in the pricing uh mechanism \n<$A> How are we ranking in the world market \n<$B> Well we are a very very small producer Mr Mahmood We produce hardly zero point five per cent of the total world production of cotton uh that Three hundred thousand bales is just about that kind of percentage \n<$A> Yah\n<$B> Yah The biggest producers as you know are the United States Russia China India and all these other Latin American countries \n<$A> Yah <ea/>Ndugu Mdope uh the General Manager of Tanzania Cotton Authority uh I understand that uh you'll be hosting two international conferences in Arusha uh Let us start with the International Institute for Cotton Who are the members and uh what are the activities \n<$B> Well the International Institute for Cotton in its short form it's IIC is a promotion and technical research organisation which was founded in nineteen sixty-six and actually it emanates from uh the ICAC which we'll be talking about later and its membership comprises  of> uh apparently Tanzania uh India Mexico Spain Sudan United Arab Republic United States Uganda Ivory Coast and a recent member it's uh Zimbabwe and I think we have also Greece on the list\n<$A> And uh what  is the purpose of this meeting which is going be uh held in Arusha \n<$B> Well this is an annual meeting uh where various topics will be discussed uh and they all concern about major policy issues uh pertaining to cotton in various cotton-growing countries given the fact that uh cotton it's one of the major export commodities for seventy-five countries in the world \n<$A> uh Where  was the last meeting held and what were the recommendations\n<$B> The last meeting was held uh last year I think in August in Memphis in the United States and at that uh meeting they discussed the annual budget and uh technical research and developing programme for the nineteen eighty-three eighty-four year and in the coming session we are going to have a review of what has been going on during the last year and discuss the programmes for the coming year \n<$A> And uh besides uh holding the International Institute for Cotton uh you have the forty-third plenary meeting of the International Cotton Advisory Committee that is ICAC uh Would you mind to tell us uh a brief background about ICAC and uh what uh are you going to discuss in Arusha", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '840ec220-5794-48ea-8470-e7f17e257000', 'added':

{'text': "<$A> We present Face the Mike Face the Mike is a half hour session of questions and answers on national and international issues Facing the microphone this week is Mr Sebastian Kingo the Honorary Secretary of the newly-formed Materials Management Association of Tanzania Mr Kingo maybe we could start our session by first listening from you what made you to start such an association on materials management\n<$B> Thank you very much uh Mr Mbunde for giving me this opportunity so that I can highlight some few items on Materials Management Association of Tanzania uh Materials Management Association of Tanzania has been formed uh officially registered on twelfth September nineteen ninety uh under the rules of uh societies and it has been recently inaugurated on thirtieth September ninety ninety-four with the patron being the Honourable Nalaila Kiula Minister for Works Communications and Transport\n<$A> Mr Kingo what are the objectives of the association\n<$B> First the main objectives of the Materials Management Association in Tanzania are mainly as follows uh First one is to encourage the exchange of ideas among materials management professionals and practitioners and promote the image and development of the profession Secondly it's to arrange for periodical meetings of members delivery of lectures reading of papers on subjects of professional or topical interest and to disseminate by any other means information considered to be of value to members and generally to promote the interests of members not forgetting uh to afford as a means of communication between the association other professional bodies and authorities\n<$A> Mr Kingo your being the Honorary Secretary of the Material Management Association of Tanzania that's MMAT Having heard the objectives maybe our listeners now would like to know if you have any branches up country or in the regions\n<$B> uh The association has just been recently uh inaugurated though it's since it's been registered since nineteen ninety Now after the official inauguration we are now trying to chart out the operations and of course we expect to operate throughout the country uh Right now we already have members uh We have about seventy-five members as at thirtieth September nineteen ninety-four and these they come from different uh parts of the country We have members for example from Tanga Sumbawanga uh and Mwanza now but our plan is that we are going to establish regional chapters as we go along\n<$A> Well as you said that you are on your way to establish the regional chapters as you go along but maybe our listeners will also like to know uh who are the office bearers as up to thirtieth September nineteen ninety-four\n<$B> uh Thank you very much Mr Mbunde uh During the annual the first annual general meeting which was uh held on thirtieth September nineteen ninety-four at the British Council Conference Hall the patron Honourable Nalaila Kiula the Minister for Works Communications and Transport remained the same while the following were elected in the governing council for the next four years We have Mr uh Edwin Mkisi who's a management consultant with SMW Management Consultants as Chairman then Ahmed Kilima the supplies manager of Tazara was elected as the Vice-Chairman and myself uh I was elected the honorary secretary Then we have a Mr Alfred Kinyundo a management  consultant with CTMS was elected as Treasurer and the other six counsellors were who were elected that day were as follows Mbesa Malambugi She is a lecturer at IFM as a counsellor Odina Kalenga a senior supplies officer with TFMC a counsellor uh Veronica Mlowezi a senior supply officer with Tanzania Breweries She is a counsellor We have Thompson Kayuni a management consultant also as a counsellor Benedict Semfukwe a supplies manager with Tanzania Breweries a counsellor and we have uh Mr O Msafiri the director of supplies and purchasing of Tanzania Harbours Authority as a counsellor as well\n<$A> Well Mr Kingo Sebastian people are now wondering that you have started this uh materials management association and there is the National Materials Board Does it mean that the Board is now phasing out to give way to your association Maybe now you will be in a good position at least to elaborate if there is any difference between Materials Management Association and the National Materials Board\n<$B> uh Thank you very much Mr Mbunde uh This question is a common one we've been asked by several other people but we would like to elaborate that the National Board for Materials Management is there to stay and the uh Materials Management Association of Tanzania is also a different a different body Now the main difference is that the National Board for Materials Management is uh a government institution which has been formed through Act Number Nine of nineteen eighty-one while the Materials Management Association of Tanzania is a voluntary association of materials management professionals So much for the difference but we also have uh some common areas whereby uh we share interests Now as I have already mentioned one of the objectives of the association is to afford a means of communication between the association and other professional bodies and authorities In this case the MMAT will provide a forum to materials management professionals so that they can come out and discuss issues of common interest with the National Board of Materials Management so that the development of materials management profession can be afforded Now of course uh uh one would also try to uh go further and say we as professionals in our association we would like to make use of our association as I said as a forum to communicate with different authorities including the Board itself For example we have come to notice that uh the profession itself the materials management profession in the country has not been so much publicised and we think this is one of the duties which could have been done by the Board Now let's say through common meetings with the Board we will discuss together and try to see how uh we can contribute promote the profession together\n<$A> Mr Kingo an additional question there You have mentioned something which is very interesting maybe our listeners would like to know You know running of an association this causes a lot of problems and I wonder whether MMAT or Materials Management Association of Tanzania has ever been facing any problems since its inception in nineteen ninety as you said\n<$B> Now thank you very much As we are we're we have recently experienced an inauguration and that means now we are ready uh to start our operations so that we can save our members and the public Now our main source of funds for financing our operations will mainly be through the uh entry fees of our members as well as annual subscription from our men But apart from that we uh expect to provide uh consultantcy services in future Now through these consultant services definitely we are going to charge fees which will be ploughed back in the association to keep the association running Now uh also since we are starting we are going to of course approach uh the parent I mean the Ministry of Works Communications and Transport uh since it is the ministry concerned with the development of this profession maybe to give us uh uh help especially during this uh start-up stage which we need some help so that uh later on we can uh finance ourselves\n<$A> Well after having that very *elaborative> answer Mr Kingo now maybe it is high time uh We always know that among the questions that people have been asking on materials management in the developing countries such as Tanzania is how are you going to educate the people on the mission of your association to both your members and the public at large because as you have said that your association it's very new and not many people that are aware that it's working Now do you have any strategies that uh can make your association be known to the public so far\n<$B> uh This is a very interesting question Now first of all I would like to say that it is very unfortunate that this profession has not delivered has not delivered the expected goods to the people and uh it is also uh very unfortunate that today we are almost marking more than ten years of the existence of the National Board of Materials Management in Tanzania Now we feel that uh in the association that this the profession of materials management uh is has been uh very much misunderstood For example uh we are we understand that our mission in fact is to try to help the users of our professional expertise to minimise the cost of their material inputs Since uh it is a professional fact that in the modern times the biggest cost factor in both production and service organisations is towards materials management and hence uh one would if one would like to follow up I mean through the financial statements of very of different organisations uh it can be seen that it is now almost more than sixty per cent of the budgets and to some extent if you take the construction uh industry it goes even up to eighty per cent of their budgets uh in one way or another used uh uh in relation to materials management uh aspects So the I mean mismanagement of materials might mean uh a attainment of of objectives of main organisations Our mission our professional mission in materials management is to help the user of our expertise to minimise the costs of input of material inputs Now uh this mission has not very well been understood and as a result up to now I'm sorry to say we are I mean the profession has not been used uh to our satisfaction and it also shows that most of our would-be users of our professional expertise they're still uh not happy with our services So one of our one of the first activities of Materials Management Association of Tanzania will be to try to create the awareness to the public that uh the profession of materials management can really solve part of their uh uh cost elements and we think without creating this awareness then it will be very difficult for us to be accepted As we know up to now our profession has been so much misused to the extent that the public and even the employers most of them have negative attitude to our people uh Negative attitude to our people in the sense that most of our people take us as you know there is a common saying in the streets these are always I mean ten per cent people or things of that sort Now so after creating the awareness through publicity I mean using the different types of news media then we would embark ourselves into uh providing consultancy services to those who'll respond to our uh awareness creation So by doing this we think uh the public or the main users of our services who are mainly employers will understand us and they will need our services But all the same on the same line that the Board uh has been given a very powerful uh mandate by the act of parliament through Act Number Nine of nineteen ninety-one to control uh the the profession and the professionals themselves but uh we are most of the materials management professionals are really wondering what is happening after ten years of NBMM existence Still uh some especially the government institutions don't seem to care uh mostly in that in Act Number Nine of nineteen ninety-one there uh is part six which talks uh mainly on the effects of uh registration and consequences of non-registration of materials management professionals Now this part has been uh As we say the Board has done a good job in training especially in training the materials management professionals but when it comes to monitoring what these people are supposed to do in the field uh we are sorry to say this has been the Board has registered almost total failure Now this is one of the aspects which we think we have to sit down and sit together and discuss with the National Board of Materials Management how uh we can work together so that the profession can help the public the way it's supposed to provide uh the professional services \n<$A> Mr Sebastian Kingo you being the Honorary Secretary of the MMAT or Materials Management Association of Tanzania you have been mentioning of professionalism in your association Maybe now you'll be in a good position at least to tell us what are the ethics of materials management professionals", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$C> Face the Mike This is a weekly half-hour session on national and international issues in which this week we look at diabetes a non-communicable disease which is nevertheless affecting many people Interviewed are Doctor Duwari of the Tanzania Occupational Health Service and Doctor Ruisa of the Muhimbili Medical Centre They are being interviewed by Radio Tanzania's <name/> Nesekeli on their diabetic camp organised by the Lions Club of Dar es Salaam city on Sunday twenty-eighth October nineteen ninety-four\n<$A> First we should like to know uh what are the objectives of the camp which will be organised on Sunday the twenty-eighth of October nineteen ninety-four \n<$B> The aim of the camp is to screen the general mass by medical check-up by doing urine and blood sugar examination for detecting new cases <O/> examination of diabetic patients and assist them by providing the detailed information for their problems \n<$A> Yah You referred to the general audience Doctor Duwari you mean  that everybody's invited uh to the camp\n<$B> Everyone is invited  to the camp so that uh this will help the general mass and this will help us also for detecting the new cases \n<$A> And what prompted you to organise the camp specifically in Dar es Salaam You mean it's a place with uh many cases of diabetes or something related to that \n<$B> No it is not like that Actually last time we have organised this camp and that was one of the most successful  camps We have tried to organise a camp in Lindi and Mwanza but uh due to the lack of chemical and some problems we could not organise the camp last year but this year we are planning to organise it in the up-countries The prevalence of diabetes  has got no concern with the township \n<$A> Yah What can you tell us about the arrangements so far How many doctors are we expecting in the camp this year \n<$B> There are a team of twenty-five doctors and uh there are specialists of different fields They will be also staying in the camp \n<$A> Yeah Can you mention the specific fields because what uh a common man like myself <./<underst understands is that uh each uh of the doctors will be connected with diabetes or something related to that \n<$B> I'll give you a general outline of the camp but all the general masses who so will come in the camp they will be passed through the screening by the general medical check-up then urine and blood examination for sugar Those  patients who are detected as diabetes as diabetic  patients and the known diabetic cases they will be sent to the consultant chambers The consultants are there for the medical specialities consultant surgeon consultant gynaecologist paediatrician dietician optomologist and in this way it means I can say all the consultant facilities are there and after the camp we will be providing them if uh we get the medicine the medicine will be provided to them free as well as one of the  books which gives a detailed information for the diabetes that will be provided free \n<$A> uh Thank you Doctor Duwari uh but we would like to know generally what is diabetes \n<$B> Actually diabetes I can say as everyone knows that a motor car needs  a> petrol to give energy to travel along the road in the same way our body needs food which gives energy to work and play After eating they start containing food They are broken down into sugar in the digestive system Then it passes from gut to blood It's carried to different parts of body to give energy In the  abdominal cavity of our body we are having an organ called  as> pancreas which produces a substance known as insulin This insulin in the people who do not have diabetes is produced by the pancreas to help sugar to get inside the tissue and to keep the blood sugar level at normal level but the person with diabetes has pancreas which is unable to produce insulin to unable blood sugar to be used as fuel and to keep blood sugar normal so the blood sugar rises to high level This is known as diabetes \n<$A> I see it's a complicated system Doctor Duwari uh but uh one would wonder uh because you have mentioned that uh within the system what is uh involved is food uh You mean it's uh food which contains sugar or any type of food which can lead to such complications \n<$B> No actually you can say that mostly the starch food are excess of sugar containing food \n<$A> Yah and uh what is actually the source of this failure of the pancreas to perform their duty \n<$B> Actually the cause of this is not yet known \n<$A> It can be as a result of some other side effects maybe \n<$B> No this can be a secondary cause \n<$A> So it means when we would like to dwell critically on what are the causes of diabetes uh what can we find actually Doctor Duwari\n<$B> Actually the causes of diabetes we do not know exactly what are the causes of diabetes There are number of different causes which are not yet fully understood but obesity should be avoided in the diabetes \n<$A> uh You have so far mentioned that there are so many cause of diabetes but most of them are not yet understood Do you mean whose task is it for uh Is it the task of doctors to carry out researches on these causes or how can you put it \n<$B> There are a lot of researches going on diabetes but uh no-one has yet established one cause that this is the only reason for  the> diabetes \n<$A> uh Let's cite the case of Tanzania are we having any research which is conducted on diabetes \n<$B> Yes in Tanzania we are having a Tanzania Diabetic Association and uh it is the chairman of the Tanzanian Diabetic Association is Professor <name/> and he is doing the research on  the> diabetes \n<$A> And what has been the recent findings of their research \n<$B> That I think uh Doctor Ruisa can tell you because he is working with uh Doctor <name/> \n<$C> Well maybe what I can say about the findings although they are not completely <O/> it would seem that we're beginning to get more and more cases of diabetes Now I'm not saying that it's increasing That could mean could meanRRR only that we are now patients are now coming they are turning up for treatment when they not used to do that in the past So it's not The results are not yet out but I can say we are seeing quite a number of patients turning up and as I said maybe it's because they are getting aware of their problems \n<$A> Yah and is it easy for a person to just trace himself that he's having that disease \n<$C> Yes there are some certain  signs and symptoms of the disease so Like uh I can tell you the most common sign and symptoms like frequent urination excessive drinking of water weight loss weakness and irritability frequent infection of his skin and gums blurring of vision slow healing of wounds If someone is having such  types of problem that person the person should go and approach the doctor and get himself thoroughly investigated for diabetes and Tanzanian Diabetic Association is providing all these facilities They are free of cost to the patients \n<$A> Yah how long does it take for one to discover that he has contacted such a disease as diabetes Is it so sooner like wound say \n<$C> No as soon as he notices this problem if he approaches a clinic it takes hardly I can say if we investigate him thoroughly it is a matter of half an hour \n<$B> Maybe I could add it's a bit tricky you know Sometimes the patient can come with wounds He's been having wounds on the back on the buttocks for about a whole year maybe a few years maybe years then only we are looking after the abscesses we find out that he's actually diabetic so it can be as well that On the other hand it can be so sudden that your patient becomes unconscious he just got unconscious because of diabetes and you find that it's because of diabetes and he says that I was previously well maybe last the two weeks except that I was feeling a bit thirsty so it's quite variable I can't say there's a fixed term you can put on it \n<$A> Now and is it infectious \n<$C> No it is not infectious It's just if you have that disease you stay with it you are not going to submit it to another person not even to your to your wife or anything it's not infectious \n<$A> I see and suppose I'm having the disease I'm suffering from disease I mean uh can my uh my son or my daughter suffer all the same from the disease \n<$C> That that's comes from what Doctor Duwari has just mentioned in that there may actually be some genetic uh element It can be inherited In some cases it runs in family It's not a very strong one as you'd say uh the father was dark skin the son will be dark skin but quite a weak association but there is a  tendency for this disease to run in families and if there is an inheritable element therefore so that one of the children might have it from the grandfather or the father \n<$A> Yeah one also wonders how diabetes can be cured Doctor Ruisa\n<$C> Now this there's no cure for diabetes I think that's uh unfortunate to say there's no cure for diabetes as such and uh except what I can say is sometimes in the early stages when you get the disease there may be a period which we call the honeymoon You see someone comes diabetes is discovered for the first time and then after about a few months he seems to be you know be<_/> getting better In fact he may get off all the drugs and he says I'm cured but we call this a honeymoon and we are sure in a few a fewRRR months it will come up and he becomes a diabetic permanently and we are not going to be able to cure this and this maybe might explain why that's what I think because there are some people who say they can cure diabetes actually even our traditional healers Now I I've been wondering whether this is not the honeymoon they are calling a cure I don't know quite *known> that but that's my fear about these claims\n<$A> uh I'm worried Doctor Ruisa because we are talking in view of the camp which will be conducted on Sunday the twenty-eighth of RRR of October nineteen ninety-four uh What makes me fear is that maybe uh because you've said that there is no cure as such for diabetes then people'll just consider the camp as useless \n<$C> No that's not true uh It's even if you cannot cure you can control For instance if you got someone with a broken arm now if you can produce you can make a hook and he can use that one a whole year and do other functions For instance uh uh Doctor Duwari has said the pancreas is diseased it's not working but through this intensive research which has been going on we know it is insulin which is not effective which is not is notRRR present or it's not enough of quantities and through the same research we have it now insulin is available so maybe if you bottle it put in bottles the patient can use it by uh by injecting himself or if I could just speak about the treatment of diabetes as such \n<$A> \n<$C> There are actually three approaches to this problem One of them is by diet the other one is you can use tablets uh to control uh the problem and the other one is you can use insulin as an injection as an injectable form Now for diet the aim with diet is to keep the person  at a good weight to maintain a normal weight There are charts which show for the given height and age this patient should have a certain weight", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$A> In today's programme of You and the Environment we have Mr William Kijoti of the Capital Development Authority CDA of the Dodoma <O/> who is the chief environment management officer Today we'll discuss on the issue of afforestation and other environment protection projects What are the responsibilities of your department under the auspices of CDA as the organ solely responsible for the development of this town\n<$B> Uh the responsibility of my department is to make the city green by planting trees and ornamentals for purposes of erosion control visual enhancement recreation and eventually timber supply \n<$A> Uh I mean those uh those  seem to be much more of afforestation rather than protection environment Don't you have other projects to enhance protection of environment\n<$B> There are also other projects such as those of erosion control pollution control and advisory services to people within the city on management of their environment\n<$A> Now how was the situation of the Dodoma town before you started the afforestation projects\n<$B> Before we started this project the town was bare dusty with the occasions of floods during the rainy season \n<$A> Uh and is it does it mean that those problems were mainly associated with the deforestation \n<$B> Sure Due to lack of trees or vegetation in general uh the city was experiencing a lot of uh strong winds carrying a lot of dust and during the rains a lot of soil was being carried from the hills into the city and so also too a lot of water we ended up with floods\n<$A> Now how many projects have you undergone since then \n<$B> date we have fourteen projects plus our forest projects and eight village projects \n<$A> I've learned that your target is to make sure that Dodoma town is changing from its semi-arid environment to a green belt Now how much successful have you been as far as that is concerned \n<$B> So far we've planted four thousand hectares and we've managed to conserve nine thousand hectares of forest That's natural forest Therefore we've a total of thirteen thousand hectares of forest developed Also in villages we've succeeded to establish trial plots or rather demonstration plots in eight villages and school woodlots in all these villages \n<$A> Yeah but you've talked of the conserved forest What do you mean by conserved forest and planting trees Does it mean that they are two different things \n<$B> Sure When we have an area which is completely open I mean without any vegetation we have to plant so that we can establish a forest When an area has a potentiality of uh being protected up to years to become a forest by its own we call it a conservation project or rather conservation forest \n<$A> I see Now what has been the people's response towards the whole plan \n<$B> At the beginning the response was negative in a lot of cases because people thought we were just trying to snatch land from their hands for no reason but later or gradually they started accepting but of course up to now it's not a hundred per cent because people need land for grazing and other uses so also due to lack of knowledge they don't realise the fact that also trees and other  vegetations><+_kinds of vegetation> are important in their environments \n<$A> Now if that is that isRRR the case uh what do you do to make sure that those people do understand \n<$B> We this is why we have an extension service whereby we visit villages and educate them on the environment and uh actually this has been quite effective \n<$A> Okay What problems have you been facing \n<$B> Our main problems have been financial and lack of people's participation \n<$A> Now what do\n<$B> That means we've had limited funds to carry out the jobs and we've had little participation from people \n<$A> When you say you have little participation from the people and on the other the otherRRR hand you said you've got what you call community forests where you incorporate people how does it I mean how is it possible \n<$B> We have projects where we try to utilise people's efforts but so far people have not co-operated so much What I mean is of course some people have appreciated but we still have a big number of villagers who don't appreciate the project and this is why I'm saying we still have a lot of work to do on extension services to ensure that people appreciate the importance of planting trees or rather protecting their own environment \n<$A> In some places when we have people who do not accept such projects we find the problems uh such as that the people would set into fire the whole place let's say the whole conserved place or the whole uh trees which were planted how about Dodoma \n<$B> That is also the case When people didn't like a project they tried to discourage it and that's why they tried to set fires and so forth but at least my experience is that this problem has gone down very much \n<$A> We all understand that environment protection and conservation is the world cry in our time and is the theme of everyone concerned every concerned people now what other projects are you involved in to match  with> that \n<$B> Other projects include purely erosion control on areas which are very much exposed to the problem and we cut up the job by say construction of check-dams planting of grass and other  vegetations><+_kinds of vegetation> which can survive in areas which have been very much destroyed Also we have pollution control programmes This is where we involve industrialists in ways that they can control uh their  disposal of residues from their industries and so forth also advisory services to villagers on how to protect their own environment is another project That makes about three programmes in addition to tree planting\n<$A> In other cities such as Mwanza for example we've got the problem of those industrialists having no plans of uh disposing their residues and leftovers from their industries and that  brings us to the problem that they're disposing their waste materials  in the lake for example Lake Victoria Now have you any specific plan or let's say specific area where you have instructed those industrialists to dispose their waste\n<$B> Sure For example for liquids we have the main sewer here in this town We have constructed a sewer which will transport all chemical residues all liquid residues to uh an extension point outside the city For  solid residues we have set aside areas where those can be dumped into pits and then covered so that they don't cause much harm to residents of the city \n<$A> Some of the problems in other big cities is that they lack proper plans for the development of their cities now and that has caused a lot of problems as far as protection of environment is concerned Now how have you go about that \n<$B> For us this city is very well planned We actually have a master plan Everything has got its own location and it has to be located there Therefore chances of making mistakes are very few For example very few cities have got this green belt project or rather uh even not only the green belt but even this *dispose> of uh residues from industries We find that most of the cities have not got this planned in advance but for us all these have been planned and implementation is according to the plan so there are no dangers or chances that we'll have such problems\n<$A> Well as far as your explanation is that you have other projects incorporated in the environment protection and we have mentioned some few now what is your success story of uh those projects \n<$B> As far as protection of the environment is concerned I can say there is a lot of success because if one had  the chance to come to Dodoma some ten or thirteen years ago the situation was really poor It was as I said plenty of dust in the city and so forth but right now the city is green especially for those areas which are planned and the belt has come up very nicely Of course we had problems but I can say it's quite a good success in general \n<$A> By the way who  finances these projects \n<$B> This project is mainly financed by the government but also we have had assistance from several organisations like UNDP WFP <name/> and <name/>\n<$A> Now what is your general view  of the whole issue \n<$B> My view is that uh the issue of environment is very delicate The environment is very difficult and expensive to handle but if not protected we have no future It requires everyone's participation and a great effort to ensure further protection People have to understand their environment and sort out better ways of exploiting it without destruction \n<$A> Well and that brings me back to the my worries When you've talked of the conserved forests it means that before the those forests were conserved those forests were catering for the people the people's needs as far as  wood for cooking let's say is concerned or charcoal-making and these sort of things Now what alternatives do you give those people instead of\n<$B> Actually that is why I said we were convinced that it was important to have village forest projects so that we could assist people in planting their own trees so that they can get their own needs from their own land and if you plant trees and take care of them you can use much less land to get enough of the requirements and also it's not only of course you are right it's not only that they were not uh I mean they were using the forest for wood products but also for grazing and so forth So we are also advising them to plant grass and tree species which can be used for as fodder and if you plant your own fodder you use much land less land also So even when we've taken so much land for forest people can still get their requirements if they use their remaining pieces of land with wood plants \n<$A> We have learned in this city that there are those problems of uh soil destruction in the sense that people are  digging out soil and some are doing that destruction on those planned areas for residential use Now what do you do to combat that situation \n<$B> There are several ways of combating the problem One is by using a bit of force to ensure that people don't get into such areas and the force is exerted by the capital <O/> authority but also the villages have been assisted and they have been encouraged to try as much as possible not to allow people to get into areas which are not set aside for excavation of sand or marm etcetera Also we've set aside areas in which we've shown people areas where they can get their requirements and those areas do not pose any danger to our environment \n<$A> Does it Is it that those sand excavators are individuals or they're grouped into companies or other groups \n<$B> It's everything individuals companies All of them want to construct They want to build houses roads and so forth So they are all involved in the destruction of the environment\n<$A> Now in forest conservation what is mainly involved \n<$B> In forest conservation the main the first thing is to get into an area and make a vegetation survey The vegetation survey is aimed at ensuring that the area has got desirable species If the number of desirable species is high enough to convince a forester that the area thus requires protection then it is conserved Now by desirable species I mean tree species which are desired regardless of their age valuable tree species in terms of either recreation timber or erosion control or even fodder After ensuring that uh we've a reasonable number of desirable trees in the area then we declare it a conservation forest and the area is completely protected no grazing no harvesting no fires and any other types of destruction in the forest", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '834364ff-14fe-43c6-981f-2fcc14c23c9e', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.086516+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': "<$A> In this edition Leila Schechashem talks about the Tanzanian Media Woman Association Crisis Centre running every Friday at Magomeni in Dar es Salaam \n<$B> The Centre has been operating for the past two years uh We decided that it is uh important to have such a centre and the first of its kind in the country whereby we give uh legal advice we give counselling to victims of domestic and sexual violence The centre uh opens every day Monday till Friday Initially we used to open on Friday afternoons and then the demand became greater and we decided to open on Monday Wednesday and Friday but now we open from Monday till Friday There is always a counsellor and a lawyer available at the Centre But uh apart from uh offering legal uh advice and counselling to victims of domestic and sexual violence we also give literature on how to avoid such uh violence for to women and children For example we have an outreach programme where we go to school and institutions of learning we visit factories and other places of work We give lectures on uh the issue of violence against women and children and we also distribute a lot of literature and we feel that uh with the increased awareness among the public on the very issue of violence that is one way of containing the problem\n<$A> For the first two years that you have been operational what would you say are the key problems that women come up with \n<$B> Uh you see initially when we started we were quite uh uh discouraged in the sense that uh most of the cases that we got dealt with inheritance custody and maintenance and we felt that we should not turn them away because that is a form of a problem although primarily the Centre was established to help victims of domestic and sexual violence We felt that okay whoever comes along we're going to help them That also included victims of drug abuse That uh also included uh victims of AIDS we offered them counselling and advice But after a lot of publicity and I have to say here that Radio Tanzania played a very big role in helping us to publicise the Centre's work we got uh cases of domestic violence and sexual harassment and sexual abuse started trickling in and uh because of this raised public awareness that women should not feel ashamed that children should not be made to feel ashamed when such cases happen that they should come forward to get uh medical treatment and to get uh uh counselling and also rehabilitation and to press charges against the assailant Somehow slowly the cases started trickling in and in the past year we have been getting a lot more cases dealing exclusively with domestic and sexual violence And uh you see uh we have uh because the Centre is the first of its kind in the country really we were sort of groping in the dark because we didn't have a blue-print whereby we could operate such a centre but uh we had a lot of literature from other centres in the world for example in Zimbabwe our sisters there are quite advanced in counselling victims of domestic violence and also in Western Europe in America and in Asia especially South East Asia We got a lot of literature from them We wrote to them letters asking them if they could send us their experiences on how to operate such a centre and from that we learned from them and we decided to adapt some of those uh experiences to our own environment And uh as I said before we were groping in the dark initially but now in the since we started two years ago up to now we have sort of we are beginning to stand on our feet we are becoming more confident and uh we are more able to offer help because now we sort of have devised a strategy and it's quite uh effective \n<$A> You told me earlier on that uh you have employed a multi-disciplinary approach to you know dealing with the cases at the Crisis Centre How do you operate \n<$B> We have uh counsellors uh from various uh fields You see we have experts For example we have lawyers We have social workers We have teachers We have journalists We have even  housewives We have religious organisations different churches and so on uh and all of us have something to offer the Centre All of us have uh experiences uh All of us have a form of expertise that can help in mobilising the public And uh each one of us contributes something For example you and I are journalists we both we're both uh counsellors in the Centre and our help has been in giving information in uh designing in editing in putting down putting up the pamphlets that are part of the literature in the programme The others the social workers for example they give counselling and rehabilitation The lawyers give legal advice The doctors come in they help us with medical advice and so on So each one of us contributes something and uh uh what uh uh has uh come up is that uh we have evolved this kind of team spirit you see among ourselves For example I co-ordinate the Centre but uh I'm not really a boss in the sense that I don't sort of give orders like uh this is what should be done We always have good meetings We have a kind of group therapy which helps us a lot because counselling is very hard work Counselling requires a lot of concentration if We have to give up a lot of ourselves in counselling Sometimes our tempers become frayed Sometimes we become nervous so we decided that we have to have a group work therapy and we decided that it is important to have a group therapy every month or at least every six weeks where we counsel ourselves and we learn from each other and also to let off steam That helps a lot \n<$A> Someone might wonder where you get the time to do this kind of thing Because I think the majority of you have your own salaried jobs  isn't it><+_don't you>\n<$B> Yes uh we all have uh we're all employed elsewhere For example I edit a magazine I also do edit books There are some of us who work in newspapers Some of us work in the Tanzananical Corporation Some of us work in different places teachers and so on Uh You see counselling is not a paying job because it doesn't pay in terms of uh monetary value You don't get you don't get much out of it If anything the stipend that one gets just barely covers the transport to and from the Centre But we get a lot of satisfaction we get a lot of uh uh a feeling of achievement from having helped people and also it helps us in the process because when we counsel the clients who come there in the process we also exercise our own fears we also exercise our own nervousness our own inadequacies and it helps us a lot that way So as I said uh counselling pays emotionally it pays morally but not in monetary form no it doesn't \n<$A> And in terms of uh uh maybe success stories Would you be in a position perhaps to pinpoint one case or two that you thought was really outstanding in which uh the Crisis Centre emerged successful\n<$B> Yes uh there are two kinds of successes here that I think I should say that The first kind is where a woman whose uh husband was battering her and uh he was battering her all the time and she came to see us and we asked us we asked her whether she wanted to press charges in court whether she wanted to sue for compensation or whether she wanted a divorce and she said no that she was still in love with her husband and we felt that okay this marriage can be salvaged We can offer counselling to the husband as well because batterers are also victims in their own way We called the husband forward and he came thank God he came there and we counselled him and we went back to the root cause of the problem and we discovered that his mother was also battered by his father and he thought that this is a way of life this is how husbands live with their wives and we tried to tell him that this is not how people live and slowly over a period of time he came to accept that battering is bad and he was ready to reform So we felt that they had to come for more counselling in the Centre but I think their marriage survived and I think they're quite happy now That is one success story The other success story is success in a perverse way because this girl got raped So I mean when you talk about success you can't say that this is a happy story It's a sad story but success in the sense that we got the assailant the perpetrator of the crime to be imprisoned for seventeen years and thirty lashings and also to pay compensation to the girl But that was not success for us as much as when the girl because initially she was quite scared to go out on her own to go on public transport because she felt that this could happen again you see the abuse We counselled her and over a period of time she could come from her home in the district to the Centre on her own without uh somebody accompanying her But later on what made us very happy was the fact that she decided to go for further studies away from Dar es Salaam where she can go  to a teacher training college And I think uh that is success in a way\n<$A> Would you say Leila such cases of rape uh are rampant say in Dar es Salaam or in the country general\n<$B> You see uh rape doesn't have a particular face or a sexual harasser or a rapist doesn't have a particular face like he has a horn on his head or he has uh he's got blue skin or No any good-looking smart intelligent educated man can be a rapist and those men who are sort of low income group dirty or they probably respect women and they take care of women and they know that rape is bad so he it doesn't have a blue-print like you can tell your children or you can tell your sisters don't talk to such a person because he could he is a rapist No he doesn't have a face What we discovered in our research and also from our work in the Centre is that uh some girls or some women got raped by neighbours people they trusted or even by brother-in-law or by an uncle people they trusted people that their parents would entrust them with Or you find that you'll find a stranger somebody who's far away from the family somebody you don't know probably he will come forward and help you So a rapist doesn't have a particular face What we what I always try to tell young girls and also women is to say that try not to walk in dark places try not to stay in the house on your own with a stranger or even if you feel that a person is becoming uh offensive put up a struggle or shout or get away from the house And also to small children we always tell them that uh you know like we have in our African society we're told that you have to respect your elders Whatever they tell you to do you have to do like you can send somebody somebody's child to the shop send somebody's child to the market It's accepted Sometimes we keep telling the parents that you be careful Tell your children to respect elders but at the same time not to be too trusting So quite often we find that those children who have been abused it's by people they know", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> We are here once more with yet another new edition of the programme Be My Guest This is a programme that invites a guest into the studio to tell us more about himself what he does and other aspects relating to life generally Well our guest today is Doctor Said Hussein Kapiga from the Muhimbili University College of Health Sciences here in Dar es Salaam Doctor Kapiga you are our guest today welcome to our programme and indeed to Radio Tanzania\n<$B> Thank you\n<$A> Dr Kapiga you are a medical doctor at the University College of Health Sciences Muhimbili Dar es Salaam Maybe to begin with can you tell us a little bit more about yourself and the type of work that you do\n<$B> Thank you Mr Tesha I am I lecture in the Department of Epidimiology at uh Muhimbili University College uh I'm teaching epidimiology which is mainly a study of uh methods and uh uh approaches which are used in investigation of diseases identification of risk factors and uh general principles of disease uh control\n<$A> That is in as far as the type of work you are doing is concerned but how about yourself\n<$B> Uh myself uh I am I started working at Muhimbili in nineteen eighty-seven and uh you know apart from my teaching I'm also working with the Ministry of Health uh in several activities related to family planning uh and you know mainly research but also dissemination of research findings\n<$A> How did it come that you became interested in this particular field of work \n<$B> Uh well my interest dates back to the medical school days yah you know I became in general interested in reproductive health and family planning is obviously one of the key reproductive health issues and obviously uh you know having gone through the courses seeing the population problems and the role which family planning could play uh I became interested to work in this field\n<$A> Dr Kapiga you are saying you are uh doing something relating to family planning services here in Tanzania What does this specifically entail\n<$B> Uh there are several things I have done but probably the most relevant for this purpose is that uh the Ministry of Health and uh the Bureau of Statistics and uh the planning uh the population planning unit within the planning commission and Muhimbili Medical Centre they developed a sort of a presentation which uh shows uh population problems in the country and also it shows uh you know family planning use and some of the problems which are associated with uh particularly low family planning use and uh the idea is we are trying to generate uh uh we are using information generated in Tanzania to try to sensitise especially people as policy makers and the other people who may facilitate uh uh who may give a helping hand in trying to raise uh family planning use uh in Tanzania\n<$A> For how long has uh this particular project been in existence and uh would you say you are making any success at all \n<$B> uh this project uh is supported by RAPID project which is uh based in uh North Carolina and the US and uh receives funds from US-AID and it started last year What was done was to put together information from different sources from different research findings and uh making sense out of this uh information Most information as you know generated from research is you know presented in scientific fora and is not really uh in usable form for policy makers and other people So this attempt tries to bring this information in a much easier way uh which can be understood by people at policy level and hopefully we'll generate their interest and their participation in uh raising awareness and also promoting uh use of family planning methods We have started the presentations about two months ago uh although we have been less successful in uh making many presentations because uh you know we are not uh getting uh many information about meetings which are happening So far we have made a presentation to the Principal Secretary in the Ministry of Health uh We also made a presentation to the uh uh Association of Statisticians the Bureau of Statistics and uh there are several planned sort of dissemination uh meetings which are planned in the near future\n<$A> Well if you travel across Tanzania you will come a number you will come across a number of uh areas large areas that are uninhabited and this is the situation in quite a number of the other developing countries Now if this is the case if that is the case why should uh uh your project uh concentrate on uh this issue of family planning in a place like Tanzania when we know that we have areas which are large areas which are uninhabited\n<$B> Yes that's a good question uh uh I think it's not the question of land uh that here you have land which is uninhabited uh I think it's more or less the issue of you know balance between resources and people you have uh Obviously we have a vast land but when you look in terms of actual resources which are available obviously uh you know we have a serious stress in our you know economic capability to support this large sort of population so that is one aspect uh you know serious threat in the population and gross imbalance uh between uh what the economy can support and what uh numbers you have in terms of people But there are also other uh health uh rationale for family planning uh you know high births uh you know many births which are not spaced are known to pose a high risk uh health condition among both the mother the family and also the babies who are born uh We know for example babies who are born very close uh together especially who are born within uh less than two year period from the previous birth they are more likely to die uh We also know women who get their first babies uh you know at early age maybe before eighteen nineteen years they are also more likely to suffer pregnancy complications uh and so forth So these are some of the rationale uh for family planning use and if I just quote some figures here you know the our population at alarming speed you know it was seven point seven million people in nineteen forty-eight \n<$A> the population in Tanzania \n<$B> Yes when the first census was uh done and this came to twelve point three million in nineteen sixty-seven and in the last census nineteen eighty-eight it was twenty-three point one million So you know our population has tripled in the last forty years\n<$A> Could you also tell us about uh the people that you intend to pass this message to Whom are you targeting at \n<$B> Yes uh you know traditionally most messages  have been directed to potential clients of family planning you know women uh attending a service somewhere You know they are given messages about family planning and the other people who are potential clients and we have evidence that awareness among people in general has increased uh But we feel people who can make things happen you know people who are in policy makers' position uh you know who can like say we need more contraceptives and they can take necessary actions to order more contraceptives or people who can say we need more messages disseminated to people or we need this kind of resources uh We found these people are least informed and uh maybe this is one reason why they are not really participating to the level which we want them to participate So we thought why don't we target this level you know make messages which are easily understood uh which can be presented in like thirty minutes These people are busy so like thirty minutes presentation and maybe ten minutes of discussion and hope at the end of that we'll generate their support and also their interest in this uh field So it's really we appreciate these are the people who can make things happen and we feel it's important that they are also drawn in as uh partners in this effort\n<$A> Now if you are targeting at the Government bureaucracy the decision makers where is the ordinary man left \n<$B> Uh we have uh of course several activities within the Ministry of Health and I'm aware other ministries like uh women development uh We have you know ongoing uh information education communication messages which are going on to these people and in fact they've been successful uh you know you ask people they tell you we know pills we know condoms we know uh whatever But uh we feel that this other part these senior officials in different positions are probably less informed and we have assumed that they know but uh we feel that we need to give them more information and we need them to be more actively involved than they are at this stage \n<$A> Are you then saying that the situation is improving\n<$B> uh Well I would say no because uh you know in general we have found awareness is high You ask people they say yes we know pills we know condoms and so forth but when you ask them in detail how does a pill work how do you use a pill how does a pill prevent pregnancy and the other things you find there uh there are obviously serious gaps in knowledge So that is one aspect The other aspect is uh use of family planning is still low We have uh you know national average of about six per cent use of modern contraceptives and when you combine with uh traditional methods it's about ten per cent you know these ten per cent of women in reproductive age and obviously this is very low rate so I think the situation is not improving and in fact the situation requires uh immediate uh effort to try to raise uh family planning use in Tanzania\n<$A> Thank you uh In order to be understood in order to achieve your objective there has to be some effective way of uh communicating uh between the project and uh those it aims at for example the decision makers the Government bureaucracy Now how do you get your messages across \n<$B> Uh we are planning to use uh you know method of presentation We have prepared a briefing booklet which summarises the messages we are trying to put across but also we'll need like thirty minutes presentation We'll make the presentation and there are two types of presentations One is a presentation which gives an overview of family planning in Tanzania and uh you know this uh in general it describes history of family planning uh and then it describes why family planning is important uh the current use of family planning and why the current use is low and then it ends with some suggestions for potential strategies which can be used to raise family planning use Uh the second presentation which is the RAPID model presentation uh this is uh really looking at population and development so it's looking at population and its relationship to the economy and to the other indices of development So those are two presentations They are all We are going to use slides or we going to use computers uh and you know uh projection material So those are the modes of presentation and we hope at the end of each presentation we'll have uh some few minutes to discuss and to uh you know raise some questions which you know we hope we will respond or you know the audience will uh participate in responding\n<$A> Now apart from the two presentations you're talking about how about the uh seminars for instance face-to-face contact Don't you also use these types to get your messages across \n<$B> Yah yes you are right we are going to use these uh You know we have two approaches one is we'll actively see the possibilities of arranging like seminars workshops In fact one of the things we feel we need like uh seminar one day seminar for you know people who are working in the news media radio you know newspapers and so forth uh and you know we hope to arrange these meetings to other types of groups but the other approach is uh you know what uh we call opportunistic approach We'll try to utilise existing meetings so if there is an existing meeting we ask the organisers if we'll have like thirty minutes within their programme and we make the presentation and so forth But also the presentation will take a form of one to one", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd8982224-b9a1-4cd2-bf25-e81c9f2f8638', 'added':

{'text': "<$A> Welcome once again to our programme of Science Spotlight Last week we heard Dr <name/> a specialist in tuberculosis and the leprosy diseases explaining in details  on> what is leprosy the causes of the disease types of leprosy and how the victims are infected As I promised you last week that we'll have the second and last part in two programmes in a series on leprosy this week Dr <name/> will go on explaining on how leprosy is cured the symptoms of the disease the incubation period of leprosy virus the consequences  for leprosy victims and who are the most affected with  the> leprosy She is beginning her explanations on ways to cure leprosy\n<$B> Uh yes If you remember my previous statement I said in former years people didn't know uh if at all leprosy was curable because most of them they ended up mutilated But as a matter of fact as science went on uh the siphons were discovered so the patients were treated by Datson Now with the treatment of Datson this is said to be a monotherapy when we say when I say monotherapy it's only one drug And one drug usually is not uh so efficient so the microbacterial lepry might develop resistance Now how come the resistance A patient himself can be lazy because of the irregularity of intake of the tablets or the drugs Now by doing so uh the uh the bacilli develop resistance Now the efforts of uh the WHO and other scientists they discovered other drugs which are more potent because we know that if you treat a case uh with two or more drugs uh the probability of the bacilli to develop resistance is almost negligible So nowadays the patients are being treated with multi-drug-therapy and this multi-drug-therapy in Tanzania is uh iso-protein with uh <O/> And in those days when they were being treated with uh Datson the duration was too long and so many of them they just dropped out and then they lost uh faith  in the treatment and they said that well they don't feel see any difference in their body but then through that uh the criteria of the bacilli developing resistance and also many patients dropping out so it was decided to use the multi-drug-therapy Uh the multi-drug-therapy reduces also the period of treatment In former years the post-bacillary cases took three years to five to be cured and the multi-bacillary cases uh took uh three years to fifteen that's lifetime But with the uh multi-drug-therapy for the post-bacillary cases it's only six months if the patient is regular and also uh twenty-four months that's two years with the multi-bacillary case if also one is regular with the intake of the drugs So we say that there's  a> very good progress in the management of leprosy So leprosy is curable Leprosy is not to be feared anymore\n<$A> What  is the incubational period of the virus of leprosy\n<$B> Uh the incubation period of this bacilli or I mean the incubation period of this disease uh is rather an a controversy You see we can say six months to forty years or six years to thirty you know it varies So there hasn't been a  real demarcation of saying this is an incubation period of leprosy So leprosy is still uh difficult if you take it on that side of the incubation period because we don't have any vaccine to test uh and also we really don't know when one has the bacilli until the time the disease comes out\n<$A> Dr <name/> can you tell me what are the consequences for a victim of leprosy\n<$B> Uh Thank you very much You know the consequences of this disease is terrible It's only the consequences that make people build up the uh stigma and with the association we are trying to remove that stigma Now uh the consequences of a badly managed case or a case which hides away and doesn't come for  the> help is disability When I say disability it's an area of the body uh being impaired  in its normal activities uh for example if one has got leprosy and doesn't come for uh to the hospital one will have the nerve damaged and then there's paralysis of that part of the body and if at all one doesn't turn up for uh help then that paralysis from being soft to will stiffened up So actually it's the disability which comes out as a bad consequence of this disease\n<$A> Thank you very much Doctor <name/> Well we've just marked the World Leprosy Day very recently and why efforts has failed to eradicate or to overcome the disease worldwide You being the vice chairperson of Tanzania Leprosy Association you can have a word or two on this\n<$B> Well thank you very much Uh I think I'll talk more on Tanzania Uh as being a chair a vice chairperson of the Tanzania Leprosy Association I would say that Tanzania has set a pace forward because uh the number of cases which were being catered since the start of this programme in nineteen seventy-seven until now it's really uh we are very optimistic that the disease will one day be eradicated because from thirty-five thousand cases in nineteen-eighty-three to three thousand four hundred in nineteen ninety-three it's very encouraging So with this we haven't put our tools down We are really working hard on it to try to see if at all we can uh fish out those who are still hiding out to treat them because it's through this way through the radios pamphlets and uh meetings that uh the health education can reach those who are really out of the city centre to come out and get treated So at least as I say with Tanzania that uh the progress is good as compared to the figures which I've just aired out \n<$A> Dr <name/> we've been dealing with uh leprous cases for quite a long time Now d'you think who are the most affected with the leprosy\n<$B> Leprosy doesn't really choose Leprosy is a disease of man Leprosy affects the young and the old the rich and the poor a male and a female So it doesn't choose really\n<$A> Doctor being a chairperson of Tanzania Leprosy Association what activities you've been doing until now\n<$B> Uh there are several activities which I've been doing The first and foremost for the Tanzania Leprosy Association is health education  of the public because we know that once the people get to know what is leprosy they'll be in the position to present themselves early to the health facilities for diagnosis and proper treatment And with our modern drugs we have already succeeded to treat so many cases of leprosy that's why the number of cases have gone down There's a real good and clear decline of leprosy in Tanzania Uh now with that we haven't really uh we haven't stopped to give more efforts to this Now we are trying to strengthen health education  of the people because we wouldn't like to see anybody being uh disabled by leprosy\n<$A> Thank you very much Dr <name/> Now for a conclusion Do you have any call to our listeners or the I mean those who affected with the leprosy\n<$B> Uh yes The community should be prepared to live with our leprous patients or to live with uh the patients who have been affected by leprosy When I say this when we live we stay with our patients or with our relatives who have been affected by leprosy one we can encourage them to take their drugs two we can share the love between us and third it will help them to be good uh symbols of good uh examples to the others that I suffered from leprosy at one time but now I'm cured That is  a> pride because one has stayed within the community and got cured within it In other words I say that we shouldn't segregate patients leprous patients Uh another thing which I'm going to make it uh clear is that leprosy is no longer to be feared because we've got very efficient drugs and they're available So it's a matter of those who listen and who are aware of the uh existing problem of leprosy to come forward for examination and then if they are confirmed to have the disease to be treated fully\n<$A> So this is the end of our session \nS1B047TB\n<$A> The amount of haemoglobin in the blood or the haematrocrit below the normal range The level of occurrence anaemia depends on sex and age A a normal man with uh he is said to have an anaemia when the haemoglobin level is below thirteen gram per decilitre while in a female she is said to have anaemia when the HB I mean the haemoglobin is below eleven gram per decilitre In infants the anaemia is said to be present when the haemoglobin level is below fifteen gram per decilitre And uh in pregnant mothers the haemoglobin level uh below ten gram per decilitre is the one which is considered to be uh anaemia\n<$B> Uh you have mentioned the two technical names and these are haemoglobin and haematrocrit What are these words\n<$A> Haemoglobin uh is a chemical substance which uh is protein in nature uh found in red blood cells and uh it is uh mainly concerned with the transport of oxygen in the blood While haematrocrit uh in simple  terms is uh percentage of blood which is uh red blood cells because we know that blood is made up of uh two major components the plasma and uh red blood cells with other blood cells but haematrocrit in short is the percentage or is the part of the blood which is covered or which constitute is constituted by RBC red blood cells\n<$B> What are the symptoms of a person who is having anaemia\n<$A> Well there are many symptoms of anaemia and these include uh easy *fatigability> and this means that the individual get tired very easily and uh they have difficulty in breathing especially when they have uh reached the point of cardiac failure They also have palpitations Sometimes they have chest pain which we call angina and uh also they have intermittent <O/> fainting and uh lastly swelling of the limbs especially the lower limbs\n<$B> What is your main concern in case of uh anaemia Doctor Kitenge\n<$A> Uh Well uh our concern as a physiologist uh is uh uh we are trying to study uh what are the physical changes which  take place in this patient with anaemia uh In patients with anaemia we have two major problems One is the reduction of oxygen load and the second one reduction of oxygen reserve The these two problems lead  to the inability of the blood to supply adequate oxygen in the tissues In normal individual adults the oxygen load to the tissues is about one litre per  minute Uh but oxygen consumption uh is uh about two fifty mills per  minute And therefore we have uh about uh seven fifty mills of reserve which we call oxygen reserve This is the oxygen which is not utilised by the tissue per  minute In anaemia the oxygen load is less than normal but the consumption remains the same And hence the reserve volume is reduced Therefore an individual will have less oxygen for exercise And therefore symptoms of anaemia occur when this individual is subjected to exertion In fact the cells become hypoxic when the haemoglobin concentration  falls below fifty per cent of the normal What are the <O/> for adaptation in anaemia Uh If an individual is subjected to a reduced oxygen load let's say by fifty per cent suddenly he will have a cerebral depression and cardiac disfunction But the individual with fifty per cent with the same fifty per cent chronic reduced oxygen load uh will have low cerebral disfunction or cardiac malfunction This difference I mean this difference is because of the compensatory mechanisms which  take place in individual with anaemia Individual with anaemia the cardiac output is increased because of vast uh and also because of the uh reduced blood viscosity The uh is uh the result of uh oxygen uh  deficiency in the tissues There is a  tendency that when there is  a> low oxygen in the tissue the blood vessels in this particular tissue uh dilate and this is the one of  theories which is called oxygen demand force When there is a demand  for oxygen uh the blood vessels in that particular tissue they dilate Also another cause of vast dilatation is uh hypoxia Hypoxia is a term which I described the lower tension of oxygen in the tissues And hypoxia has a direct effect on the blood vessels and uh therefore they dilate in order to improve uh blood supply that to the tissues Another cause of vast dilatation uh is the accumulation of uh chemical substances in the tissue uh which are the result of uh unaerobic uh metabolism and one of the of these chemical substances is uh lactic acid and this is exchanged uh by the another theory called uh chemical theory uh which uh is an important uh theory explaining how the local blood supply to tissues is uh regulated Viscosity in uh also  increases uh cardiac outputs because uh the blood will pass easily in the blood vessels and therefore there will be uh minimal resistance and therefore the uh amount of blood which will be going to the heart will be uh increased and therefore uh the cardiac pressure will also increase",

{'text': "We present Women's Half-Hour\n<$A> It's time once again when we invite you to another programme of Women's Half-Hour Today Dr Augustin Masawe lactation management consultant at the Muhimbili Medical Centre talks about breast-feeding He is being interviewed by Radio Tanzania's <name/> First he outlines the advantages of breast-feeding for children\n<$B> One of the advantages which is well-known to all of us is that the best milk from the mother provides the best nutrient for a child during the first four months of life up to six months of life and mothers uh who have been able to adhere to this their babies grow very well without adding anything to the milk things like uh glucose or water or honey and so on so that the other advantage is that uh for the child survival It is known that uh babies who are breast-fed on mothers' milk they have got uh a protective effect against main infections including diarrhoea which for which is the main killer of our children in this country and uh there are other infections like acute respiratory tract infection urinary tract infection <O/> all these are very common during childhood and it has been known that uh even diseases like asthma uh eczema and uh uh uh rhinitis allergy are common in babies who have not been breast-fed during this period Uh the other advantage is that we know that  babies they grow better and they're not only physically but they are mentally more intelligent Their the uh mother provides a very strong bonding and this bonding is both an emotional bonding psycho-social bonding which is very important for the child's survival not only when he's young but uh to an adult Uh the other advantage of breast-feeding in these children is that uh they even the dental development the jaws and so on disease of the teeth they are less in babies whose mothers have been breast-feeding. Studies done in developing countries and even in developed countries have surely indicated that uh breast-feeding does protect a lot of the malnutrition Uh children who are not breast-fed they are not well nourished and uh this is uh very important particularly when you know in this country uh a lot of children are malnourished during the first two years of life and if the babies are breast-fed uh this milk provides not only the good growth of the child but also gives nutrients uh things like uh uh vitamin A are very important in breast milk and also uh other trace elements which are found in breast milk and this provides better nutrient for the child and also better survival for this particular child\n<$A> What about bottle feeding Does it have any effect  on the baby\n<$B> Oh yes bottle-feeding has got a lot of adverse effects in children in fact uh uh the uh uh if you have read the literature on the history of bottle feeding uh Cecil Williams who is an expert on bottle feeding from Australia uh clearly indicated about fifty years ago that bottle is a great killer and we have found out in developing countries children who have been having bottle-fed uh when they are supposed to be breast-feeding they have uh adverse effects like they get diarrhoea uh they get uh uh infections and also they don't grow well One of the uh disadvantages of bottle feeding is the economics of bottle feeding Children who are bottle-fed uh the parents have got to incur a lot of expenses to buy milk from the shop A child when he is having diarrhoea or acute respiratory tract infection this child is admitted in  hospital Parents have especially nowadays of cost sharing parents have got to buy medicine and the mothers have got to spend nights and days in  hospital and this uh disturbs a lot of the economy of the family We know very well the money is going to spend on the treatment of this child and uh it involves the government and the society uh in disturbing the economy The other problem which we know in bottle-feeding is that uh uh the mothers uh who have been bottle feeding these children they don't again go back to breast-feed their children which actually results  in malnutrition and which is a big killer in this country\n<$A> For how long a mother should breast her baby\n<$B> Well uh it is recommended that a mother should breast-feed her baby exclusively that we stress that exclusive breast-feeding during the first four and six months There are babies who can get very enough milk even up to six month without adding anything to the baby but we know that uh uh babies can be uh get accustomed slowly when they are already four months of age to the locally made available food-stuff at home like <ea/>uji in some uh or any type of cereal which the baby can get at home the uh and the baby should continue breast-feeding after starting the complementation and it's strongly recommended to continue up to two years or even beyond\n<$A> Dr Masawe there is another problem that uh some mothers in this country or elsewhere in this world breast-feed their babies sometimes only three months and thereafter nothing is coming out What do we do to such women\n<$B> That's a very good question uh This uh problem of the mothers stop breast-feeding at uh around three months or even earlier there are some mothers even who breast-feed and after about one month they say they have not enough milk Well there are a lot of reasons uh which are due to this One is that uh lack of education The other thing is uh some taboos uh influence some mothers to breast-feed their children for only one or two months because they introduce uh other foods other than breast milk too early and therefore when the baby for example starts <ea/>uji at two months and the baby's stomach gets full up the child cannot feed and therefore when we put the babies to breast then the baby can't suck the mother cannot produce milk and therefore when the baby sucks an empty breast he will automatically refuse because this mother gets then gets a vicious circle my child is not sucking and the baby gets angry because the mother is not producing enough milk and therefore the mothers the mother and the child they are all stressed and they end up mother saying look I can't breast-feed my child And that's one of the main  reasons and that's why we encourage mothers to get all the support not only uh in the  hospital but home also the society can give support to these mothers yeah and they can continue uh doing so until they are two years I understand that there are mothers who are working Usually in Tanzania the maternity leave is very short uh for a breast-feeding mother This should be actually uh prolonged so that the mothers are able to provide this very important nutrient to their babies and even when they are uh working mothers\n<$A> It is also believed that uh breast-feeding is best for mothers How is it useful\n<$B> Well uh breast-feeding is actually very useful to the mother One or the best uh uh  example we can give is it provides a natural protection against uh early pregnancy If the child is exclusively breast-feeding the mother will get lactational mnoria and will get uh uh uh uh a natural contraception and therefore will not get uh uh uh pregnant Two the mother uh gets uh love if particularly if the family is involved and in taking care of a mother who is lactating and also it helps the mother to remove the extra fat which she gained during pregnancy which is important for ladies to remember this because even if you put on twelve kilos during pregnancy I can assure you that it will go away by the time you have been breast-feeding for the first six months but if you breast-feed for only two months uh is very difficult to uh remove all that fat which was laid down for the baby and also for you\n<$A> Uh what about fathers uh Breast-feeding is also best for them\n<$B> Yes uh uh the fathers of course they should understand this If you have got a mother who is breast-feeding uh we have stressed the love the warmth the economy and the uh the uhRRR growth of the child both mentally and physically and uh if you have got a healthy child at home who is not going to because of diarrhoea because the mother didn't breast-feed the father will be very happy yeah and also not only that If the father is a supporting husband to his wife then uh this particular wife will also get this uh very important support and the father will be even a happier father and they actually could spend more time at home instead of spending his money to drink away while the mother is busy breast-feeding and yet another thing with the fathers which they should do to help the mothers so that they will be able to breast-feed is to make sure that the mother is resting having some rest during lactation because if the mother doesn't get enough rest then she does not have uh she does not produce enough milk and uh she uses her energy to do other works which the father actually can help like looking for firewood water particularly in Tanzania whereby mothers they have got to walk miles even RRR even for hours and the father is sitting at home And I think it's important for fathers to really give this nice support and they will be both happy and uh also if you can space your children yeah then you have got you have you can plan actually when you are going to have your children and these issues can only be discussed and uh and understood if the father also  takes the initiative in learning the advantages of breast-feeding\n<$A> I have another interesting question Dr Masawe that some tribes in this country like the Wagogo prefer to feed their babies using one breast Do you think that is the best way\n<$B> No nature it's provided a human being with two breasts one on the left on the right Animals if they have got many puppies like uh uh goats or even the lions they have got many more breasts This is a natural survival and human beings have been created by god that uh they have two breasts that means you have got enough too for that child and uh uh it's unfortunate that you have actually found this in Dodoma Not only Dodoma in Singida in Coast-region and so on there is a belief among which is a bad taboo and needs a lot of uh education looking deep into the roots and causes of this but uh this is not the right way of uh actually practising this method Unilateral breast-feeding uh does produce uh insufficient milk to the child yeah Unless the mother has got a disease on one breast in a lot of breast-feeding it should be discouraged Taboos which are or uh bad cultures which are encouraging unilateral breast-feeding like in Dodoma and Singida should be discouraged and uh uh these mothers are the ones  who actually who should be be able to be educated particularly the community where she lives So this culture can slowly die away\n<$A> Can you give us uh the trend of breast-feeding in this country Is it rising or declining or stagnant\n<$B> Yeah the trend if you look at the trend in the urban areas the trend of breast-feeding is on the decline Figures quoted in from Dar es Salaam uh uh mothers uh uh who are in urban areas uh particularly the high income group the tendency to breast-feed has declined and in the rural areas uh it is supposed to be about hundred per cent who breast-feed But what is very what is very interesting is that the exclusive breast-feeding is also on the decline even in the rural areas and uh this could be the introduction of uh uh urban culture into the villages where people have thought uh that bottle feeding is uh superior to breast-feeding and I think uh this should be uh known to all Tanzanians that this trend uh should be actually kept to the maximum that our children are totally breast-fed that means close breast-fed and continue breast-feeding and that's why we have got uh uh this programme on uh educating health workers in particular and educating the community yeah and we'd like the mass media to continue this nice programme so that the community can be well conversant with the advantages of breast-feeding",

{'text': "<$B> Well Tanzania Occupational Health Service its major objective is preventive services to ensure healthy workforce in our industries So we have to think of the major objectives in ensuring occupational health amongst the work force and uh one of the objectives of ensuring occupational health amongst the workforce is uh uh uh is enlightening the workforce from the roots and ways of preventing uh occupational hazards and where occupational hazards are not easy to prevent uh we happen to get a lot of injured workforce at the places of work So the objective of this short course was to equip uh employees as well as employers and those who are interested in uh safeguarding the life of an injured person with the knowledge and techniques of uh industrial first aid\n<$C> Did you have specific qualifications for the participants who were involved in the course\n<$B> Well we did We actually did because we did announce in our local media The Daily News uh the seminar when it was supposed to take place the dates the venue and the duration and in the announcement we did exactly specify what quality of personnel we needed to attend the course uh We wanted the industrial uh safety officers We wanted foremen shift supervisors uh We also wanted some individuals from the management of the organisations because uh industrial first aid provision is an expensive affair You've got to purchase some equipment You've got to have uh the gadgets ready available at the place of work so that you could provide industrial uh first aid So we did specify exactly whom we need for the course and it is not actually very proper that you've got to have qualified individuals to do industrial first aid uh You can have anybody because industrial first aid or first aid as such is provided everywhere It's provided on the major highways It's provided in industries It's provided at home It's provided even in offices It's provided well uh practically everywhere So it's proper that everybody every able adult should be able to know uh something about first aid as such\n<$C> I would like also to know whether the course was a practical one or you just did it theoretically \n<$B> Well uh we did manage to get a very good comment from one of the participants because we did actually manage to intermarry theory and practicals and we believe that the participants did actually benefit from both theory and the practicals which we did uh provide them \n<$C> Can you tell us the what exactly made you to involve workers only to attend the course\n<$B> Well thanks Penzi You know the our clients who whom we give uh services in this organisation are mainly employees in industries uh The major question is I mean industries are not only those working with machines in factories producing you know uh finished goods No agriculture is also an industry So when we say that our clients are workers in industry we don't mean only the workers working with machinery in factories we also mean uh every able person who is working uh So what we actually did it was not the intention was not to involve only the workers but our major clients whom we provide services in this organisation are employers and employees of the surrounding uh industries So we did target the workers of these particular industries to attend the seminar\n<$C> It is so simple to say first aid but uh I think to medicine people it might uh mean or it might involve many things Now what do we mean by first aid\n<$B> Okay thank you very much Well the definition of first aid is a bit complicated but we can easily just say that it is actually the initial but essential treatment provided to an injured individual as a step towards more competent hospital treatment So it is a life uh saving situation which a first aider is first with on the initial step of uh ensuring the the saving of an injured the saving of life of an injured person\n<$C> Is it possible for an ordinary person uh who is not a nurse or a doctor to provide first aid service\n<$B> Well sure well you remember at the beginning I said that it is very important for uh an adult to know something about first aid and the necessity why we think that uh every adult should know something about first aid is just imagine at home your child could most probably grab a bottle of let's say drugs or poison accidentally and drink it and uh you don't know what to do but in the short course we had there was a topic of poisoning by mouth that is the participants were enlightened on what to do and how to handle an injured person who has been poisoned by mouth So it is very possible for an ordinary person It's possible for a mother It's possible for a father It's possible for a you know somebody who just is a street vendor to know something about first aid and to be able to provide first aid to an injured person\n<$C> Let us now go more practically as far as first aid is concerned then how would one assist a person or while on duty his leg or arm is cut off by an object\n<$B> Okay thanks very much Penzi uh That's an interesting question uh I remember when I was young my dad once told me that if you see somebody bitten by a snake what you do first is you put a tonicate on the proximal end of the bitten limb in order to prevent the uh up-flow of the poison to the circulatory system uhm and then I think what he said was having done that you've got to get a razor blade or a sharp object and you make a thorough cut a deep cut on the bitten side so that the poison would uh ooze out Well your question was how would one assist a person whose arm or leg has been cut off I think the major threatening of life in that aspect is the injured person is <slang/>gonna bleed to death because there are major blood vessels which are widely open after the amputation of the limb So the first idea what I think uh a first aider should do is to ensure that there is no unnecessary blood loss uh to the cut-off leg or arm as you said So what he's supposed to do first is apply a tonicate Now you apply a tonicate on the proximal side of the amputated limb in order to prevent uh blood loss and again you make sure that you rush the patient very fast to a nearby uh hospital where proper surgical toilet could be done and proper hemostasis so the blood vessels could be tied\n<$C> Now what happens when a person who got an accident would not be able to get first aid service and let us say when life is threatened\n<$B> Okay that's a good question because you said when life is threatened yeah It's true uh let's look at it this way supposing somebody is involved in an accident and uh let us assume that he's got an artificial danger in his mouth and this artificial danger uh slips into the throat and most probably blocks the airway Well uh for a first aider when he observes such an injured person the first thing he's got to note is whether the injured person is breathing or not breathing If he's not breathing the first step is to make sure that the injured person is breathing So when he looks into the airways the nose the mouth he might find that there are these artificial dangers blocking the airway So the first thing he's got to do is to get it out and uh place the injured person in a manner that the airway's free so that uh he or she can breathe easily uh Depends on the speed of how the first aider could do this uh injured person could start breathing normally and in such a situation where life was exactly threatened the first aider has managed to save the life of the individual\n<$C> I remember you told us that one of the objectives of the course was to equip the industrial or to equip industrial people with the knowledge on first aid uh Do you have other reasons that have prompted you to conduct such a course\n<$B> Oh yes sure well uh It's a question of being useful to the public uh Prevention they say is better than cure uh If you think I mean if you take into consideration the liberalisation nowadays of uh our industries and the liberalisation of the economy of the nation uh there are so many things which we are importing right now in terms of raw materials in terms of machinery and these raw materials and machinery do not take into account the safety of the workforce So the major reason again why we thought that first aid is important amongst the workforce is to safeguard them with the pending idea that the safety of the work environment is uh endangered\n<$C> I am sure most of the participants uh were those who have uh a bit of knowledge about health issues Now why should you involve such people in that course while they are already well educated about health issues\n<$B> Uh not really I wouldn't say that all the participants were amongst the individuals with the knowledge on uh medical issues or health issues No we had some engineers and we had some uh shift supervisors We had some industrial safety officers and also we had the medical personnel and their nurses uh that is dent doctors in various workplaces but this doesn't matter really because there is uh a proverb of which says that repetition is the mother of knowledge Well whether you are a doctor or a nurse and whether you passed through uh the academic ladders of classrooms you've got to keep on attending seminars attending workshops you know seeing new developments in medical field and uh the major reason I think why we did involve such persons with uh medical knowledge is we also wanted to share the experiences in their place of work and uh also we wanted to train them so that they can train others on the industrial first aid so it was a matter of a give and take affair Those who had something to give us we were very thankful we got it from them and those had something to get from us I think we are also thankful that we managed to give them something\n<$C> How successful is the course so far\n<$B> Well uh we did evaluate the course We did evaluate We did some evaluation after the course and we did manage to get some comments from the participants uh I would most probably mention a few comments One of the comments was that they feel that the course was rather short They felt that we could give it about two more days to make it at least a week or five days and uh also they felt that some of the periods were too short to be able to cope with uh both theory and practical so they suggested that the periods could be a bit longer So if you got longer periods then you'll have more days of the seminar and again they some of them mentioned that they never knew that this organisation has the objective of ensuring health and safety at workforce So it was their pleasure to know that and uh they also managed to give us a pat on the back that the course should be conducted more frequently and we did appreciate their comments So in conclusion we said that the seminar or the short course was very successful\n<$C> So you have an intention of organising another seminar of the same kind in future\n<$B> Well Penzi you know we organise such seminars every now and then and we've got a schedule We've got a total of three short courses which we will conduct in the course the courseRRR of the year We have an industrial first aid for the uh low cadres and we have industrial first aid course for the uh trainers and we have health and safety at work uh for uh the industrial safety officers for the uh workshop officers for the production section and also for the resident medical officers", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source':

{'text': "<$A> I understand that uh you are a health officer and you have been dealing with uh primary health care for over fifteen years So would you be kind enough to state what are the oral health goalsfor the year discussed or for five years\n<$B> Thank you Oral health goals for Zanzibar year two thousand and three are comparable with similarly oral health goals for mainland Tanzania mainland I mean We have divided these goals in three primary secondary and tertiary The primary goals requiring preventive educational and investigative activities Goal number one The percentage of five to six years old who will be caries-free is tentatively fixed at fifty per cent That is goal number one Goal number two The prevalence of endemic fluorosis needs further investigation before the revelance of goals can be determined Goal number three Twelve-year-old children will on average have no more than two point five DMFT that is decayed missing and filled teeth Goal number four In twelve-year-olds <O/> bleeding will occur in no more than two sextant <O/> CPITN index Goal number five in primary goalEighty per cent of population should retain all their teeth excluding molars at the age of eighteen Primary goal number six More data on the level of edentulousness within the age group thirty-five to forty-four and fifty-five and above are needed before setting a goal If uh there is any edentulous at the age of thirty-five uh You know the meaning of the word edentulous Toothless mouth uh Primary goal number seven All uh mothers attending MCH clinics and all twelve-year-old primary school pupils will receive oral health education as part of general health education programmes Also there's these secondary goals which require curative activities In in primary goals we need only preventive educational and investigative only but in secondary we require curative and this one is much expensivein implementing Goal number eight we continue Seventy-two per cent of the DMFT index in twelve-year-old children will be composed of the decayed component Goal number nine Twenty per cent of the DMFT index in twelve-year-old children will be composed of the missing component and number ten eight per cent eight per cent of the DMFT index in twelve-year-old children will be composed of the filling component and the third tertiary goal this requiring administrative activities Goal eleven from this tertiary goal the entire population will have access to equitably distributed emergency and preventive oral health services within less than half a day's journey from their place of residence and the last goal A data-based system for monitoring changes in oral health and the implementation of oral health programmes will be established\n<$A> Oh Thank you very much What I have observed or what I have heard from you is that your oral health goals suggested for the year two thousand and three have been formulated in accordance with World Health Organisation recommendations regarding health for all by year two thousand\n<$B> \n<$A> Is that okay\n<$B> \n<$A> And uh they are nearly the same as the Tanzanian mainland\n<$B> \n<$A> So what uh or rather let's say which strategies or do you have any strategies which can be applied in order to approach the goals for the year two thousand and three\n<$B> At present there are few data available on this particular age group For goal number one I mean \n<$A> \n<$B> Because we have divided each goal and the strategies so it will therefore be necessary to carry outclinical epidemiological survey to set an accurate goal uh The provisional percentage is a rough estimate derived from the corresponding goal of sixty to sixty-five per cent for mainland Achieving awareness of oral health and disease as well as daily oral hygiene habits in young children and their mothers through oral health education in the MCH clinics is going to bemain contribution for this age group throughout the current five year period Okay Should sign of sustained increase of caries arise combined with a change in the pattern of caries progression to other occlusal surfaces a fluoride intervention programme might be considered in particular the feasibility of fluoridation of piped drinking water in Zanzibar town As in goal number two this strategy is about fluoride <O/> Existing level of naturally occurring fluoride in drinking water are knownfor Zanzibar town only because there is no proper data In order to decide onproper means of dental caries prevention mapping of fluoride contents of drinking water should be undertaken as a minimum in areas suspected of dental fluorosis for example the coastal area between Uwa and Jambiani Okay No question From goal number two uh and goal number three and four these usually go together The DMFT for children aged twelve to thirteen begins around two point five Therefore the goal of two point five for that two thousand and three <O/> and<O_><O/> of status quo And as for periodontal disease the goal has been set arbitrarily using the mainland criteria although recommended by WHO uh the CPITN for this age group has not yet been introduced But in Zanzibar like in many other countries the twelve-year-olds have been selected as the main group\n<$A> uh I'm sorry to intervene you have said that what is the meaning of CPITN\n<$B> This is a the special index we are using to represent community periodontal index of treatment needs On examination of these pupils or these children we are using this reflecting index to detect their problem in their mouth Okay I think you get it \n<$A> Yah\n<$B> As I said Zanzibar is a country where twelve-year-olds are the pilot group okay for prevention or intervention as you know Primary or level number two will be <O/> with the aid of this age group that means twelve-year-olds Actually combined with twelve-year-olds standard four to five mainly standard four to five \n<$A> Well I think uh I've got the strategies and I think there are so many but uh from the few which I have got I think uh you know as a health officer here in charge I think you are in charge here Have you taken any trouble onvisiting areas very important areas like schools because I've heard that you mention pupils or in rural areas to give them any dental health education because what I have noticed from your point uh is that the age you mention there rangefrom five years old to fifteen to sixteen years old and uh if you go there to visit uh those pupils uh what do you recommend them to do and how far you are going thereto maybe check if they are uh doing what you are telling them to do\n<$B> Well up to now from where we've set these goals we are facingmany problems especially these financial problems To set goals it is very simple you know because it's just to sit on a tableand then writing\n<$A> Yah\n<$B> but in implementing you're going to face a lot of problems As you know the problem comes like transport First of all to reach tothe schools or in clinics for example in poorer rural areas it is difficult for us uh We're havingthis problem of transport and once you have this transport and you reach there sometimes you can find that they are not well prepared to meet us because the information maybe was not proper but we are trying to reach them and mainly we are trying to go to these clinics MCH clinics because we want to start to give mothers oral health education because when you treat a woman when you treat a woman you treat a family as you know So we are trying to teach mothers how to take care of their of the teeth of their children and then because this it costs less I think you can say that just the transport will be enough to reachbut when you want to go to schools you need more things You need to teach the pupils to do some pretty things like tooth brushing and then let's say play these games because you have so many activities in schools but in MCH programme you can see they're just talking and I think we are trying to communicate with these DANIDA so they can help us supply these things so we can implement properly these goals we have already settled I think I have answered your\n<$A> Yes but uh I don't think I'm prying on your mattersbut uh after all who is the is theRRR donor maybe of this programme because what I know is that uh things like dental health care or any other thing I think they are connected with big uh organisations in donor countries \n<$B>As I said actually these Danish I mean DANIDA are sponsoringThey promised us to supply many many things so we are waiting but we have already started to do these things which can be implemented without having transport attending MCH clinics which are very nearby including towns or schools which are in towns But the problem actually is uh the children in schools because our problem main problem is once you go to school you teach uh the pupil how to clean your teeth how to know which tooth is bad which is good Once they've found out they have got a bad tooth then they'll come\n<$A> to your clinic\n<$B> and I think there are going to be many many pupils because we have started to visit town schools primary schools in town And as you know in town there is much more dental caries than in rural areas I think you know why\n<$A> No\n<$B> This is because of sugar consumption in towns They've got these pipis chewing gums and so on That's available in town then so\n<$A> But in rural areas I think they have things like sugar canes and maybe other things\n<$B> Actually sugar cane is not uh you wouldn't call it as a <O/> food because when you chew uh let's say when you chew this sugar cane you will chew until finally you're going to brush your teeth with the what you call uh after you have chewed the \n<$A> remainder \n<$B> yah yah I mean the remainder of the You are going to brush your teeth with that So as you know the dangerous sugar we are saying here is these <O/> because they are sticking \n<$A> Well then I think I have to thank you very much for providing me or supplying me with this information Thank you very much\n<$B> Thank you\nS1BINT1T\nWe present Women's Half Hour We are glad to invite you once again to another programme of Women's Half Hour Today we'll present the activities of the Centre for Children's Rights in Mwanza Some people have the tendency of neglecting children for no reason but others have the feeling that children are the most valuable in a society and so they should be given all necessary basic needs That is  the> exactly what the Centre for Children's Rights popularly known as  Koleanado in Mwanza to promote the welfare of children The centre was established in nineteen ninety-three but it has done tremendous efforts towards children's development In this interview with Radio Tanzania's <name/> Mungumi the Director of the Centre Mustafa <name/> outlines the main activities of the organisation He begins by telling us the kind of rights they're fighting for the children in Mwanza \n<$B> Well what we're trying to do is fight for all the rights of children in Mwanza Uh if you take into account the UN convention for the rights for the child which Tanzania has already signed uh there are about eighteen rights that are encompassed in that convention uh These include rights for a child to have access to good health services access to education especially primary education access to uh uh their basic having their basic needs met and that includes having shelter access to a loving respectful environment and access to a place to play a place where they can come and children can call their own and make it whatever they would like to make it make of it \n<$C> And uh which type of children do you concentrate  on\n<$B> Okay currently we're working mainly with street children in Mwanza and by street children I mean those who have been completely abandoned and are on the streets of Mwanza who are not with any adult uh who are trying to make do with life on their own \n<$C> And why the street children alone because we have the orphans and those coming from poor families and uh I think they all need to get their rights What is so special to the street children \n<$B> Well the issue really is a voice I mean street children children in general are not very well heard in our society and they tend to be neglected they tend to be put on the side when they have a suggestion to make you say uh you're just a child stay away from me but when you look at the issue of street children because even among children you have different hierarchies well street children are the most marginalised of all children Their voices are not heard uh They are often interpreted in very negative ways Either they're thieves they're trouble makers uh in Swahili <ea/>wajambasi in all kinds of ways which portray them negatively so when they try to say something let's say look we need access to education we need access to shelter we need access to uh a good place to have a shower for all that it matters nobody listens Everyone is quiet There's not a single group in There's not very many groups that have taken up their issues and said we'll work with you we'll work with you we'll fight together with you we'll fight for your rights Unfortunately because this is a world that is that is interpreted through adults' eyes and adults' voices the children need adult supporters to be with them so that their voices can be heard and Koleana is an organisation which is here to do that to be with the children so that they can fight for their own rights \n<$C> That's very interesting Mustafa but uh I would like also to know how many children do you provide them with the accommodation at the centre \n<$B> Okay the accommodation as I said before is just very basic stuff When we started we didn't intend to have accommodation We were hoping to make the street safer for the children but that hasn't worked uh partly because the adult world is so hostile to the children so what we have provided are bamboo beddings which are very popular here in Mwanza and we put them on the veranda and the children sleep on them and they have a bedsheet to cover them with Uh but it's open-air sleeping full of mosquitoes We've put some mosquito coils but uh we still have a lot of malaria infection We're not intending to put up anything big because it's extremely extremely expensive to build and one mattress for example the cheapest mattress here in Mwanza costs something like fifteen or sixteen thousand shillings Multiply that by hundred and you have a massive figure and the number of children keeps increasing so we would like our capacity to work with children not to be limited uh by providing them with full-time shelter \n<$C> That is at least an accommodation and rather than sleeping  on the pavements Anyway now what do you do to them next Do you send them to school or what do you do in order to make them feel as part and parcel of the society \n<$B> Well there's a whole lot of issues The first and most important thing is all their basic needs are met here By basic needs I mean they have access to a good toilet system They have access to good showers Some of them have access to lockers We're in the process of building more lockers more cupboards for the children to keep their clothes in When you think of how people get really angry when they give a child some clothes The child was on the streets and you see them throw away their old clothes and put on the new ones and just keep those old clothes away but then when you think about it they threw them away because they have no place to keep them and here in Tanzania it's too hot to have two pairs of clothes on at the same time if you want to preserve them so what we are trying to provide each child with is a safe space to keep their extra clothes some of their extra belongings because you need that if you want to survive on the streets uh More than that they have access to basic health services As you know health services are no longer free in Tanzania but street children often don't have the money to access these services in the first place so what we are providing through help from UNICEF and uh uh a German group called Action Medior is we provide them with free medical services right here at our centre There's an assistant medical officer who helps us with these issues \n<$C> Uh when I was walking around I met with some of them and they said you just provide them with shelter but no food why is that so \n<$B> Okay that's always uh a big issue A lot of people in the community have confronted us with about it uh The issue is this when we first started this work we did we didn't just start it by putting up a centre and deciding what was best for the children We talked with the children We found out what was important in their lives and we also followed them around to find out how they were surviving and one of the issues is street children are incredibly resilient they are incredibly creative about finding ways to survive and one of the things we found out was each one has very legal jobs that they were doing to get food for themselves and our intention here at the centre is to build on what the children already know what the children are already doing rather than taking away all of what is important to them and saying we know what is best for you We don't know what is best for the children The children themselves know what is best for them So they work in food stores They work selling uh chewing gum and sweets They work at making <O/> This is Mwanza We have a big lake so they are the ones who have fishing lines and go and fish because you can fish in two hours you get enough fish to get money for three good meals that particular day So they are doing very well on their own We do provide food for those who are very young We have children who're four years old five years old all the way to children who are about eight We provide food to all the children who are on medical care and we provide food for children who are on specific programmes like those who are going to school They get breakfast and lunch but they still have to after their homework they have to go out and work to get money for their dinner uh Other than that what we try to do is make sure that the child is getting good nutritious meals wherever they're working \n<$C> Okay can you tell us uh how old is the youngest uh as well as the oldest one at the centre\n<$B> The youngest one as I said Hamisi is four years old He's been on the streets for about a year now uh The oldest one is fifteen and that's only because we have set a limit There are street youths we're working with that we have some kind of relationship with they are about uh twenty twenty-one and they go onwards because there are a lot of people who've been on the streets for a very long time but we work mainly with I mean with all children up to fifteen years of age \n<$C> uh you know Mustafa street children have already used to go to roam about in town and uh sleeping  on the pavements now how did you manage to convince them to join you with the centre \n<$B> Uh it was actually quite easy because what we did was we worked in the streets ourselves Uh lots of people in town who knew we had been to university and we had studied thought we were crazy spending all our time on the streets sitting in the hot sun on a pavement with the children but what we did was build relationships with the children showed them that we were there we were their friends and then we started talking with them getting to learn what was important to them so if they needed health care we accompanied them to the government hospital uh For those who had been arrested under the hooliganism and vagrancy act and taken to prison we'd be there in the courts defending them So slowly they realised that we were with them we were supporting them and we wanted to work with them So up to now at this centre often people ask us how do you round up the children Well we don't round up the children The children come on their own They're free to leave when they want to and they're free to come in when they want to New children aren't We don't go out on the streets looking for new children to pull in Other children who are already members of our programme when they see a new child on the streets will immediately say look if you want a nice place to shower a nice place a warm place to sleep well why don't you come to Koleana and we'll get registered So the children themselves bring other children in That's what the name of our organization is all about as well We're called Koleana which means supporting one another nurturing one another and that is one thing that the street children have always had because they don't have adult supporters in this world they at least have support of each other Of course you see them fighting and doing things like that but ultimately they know they're in it together not with It's not the adults who are important it's each other that's most important \nS1BINT2T\nThis is Spotlight on Tanzania In this week's edition of Spotlights on Tanzania we focus on Rural Medical Aid's Training Centre in Songea Ruvuma region Welcome to the programme \n<$A> The centre was established in nineteen seventy-three being entrusted by the task of training rural medical aides to man our rural dispensaries This particular centre recruits class seven leavers who receive a three-year course in various medical subjects The Songea based Rural Medical Training Centre currently has a total of one hundred and seven students who are eager to finish their courses and work with the rural people The centre's operations will come to light after talking with the centre's administration members of the staff and students To set the pace in motion the centre's principle Dr <name/> summarises the centre's activities and set-up\n<$B> Uh this institution was uh  founded in nineteen seventy-three uh by the following objectives training village health workers at a dispensary level Uh we have several departments in this training institution uh To start with we have principal's office which deals with the administration finance management students' curriculum implementation We have the next department which is uh vice principal's office which is uh co-ordinating the studies which are uh uh running around the institution throughout the duration of uh  instruction Then we have the staff office Here is where the different tutors are uh supposed to meet and prepare for their lessons before they move to their classes We have the finance office whereby the finance matters are being uh taken care of and then we have others like typing pool stores and we have several drivers who all in all help us greatly to make uh to facilitate the activities which are going around in this institution Uh we have about as I have said already we have about one hundred and seven students uh uh First years uh about thirty-seven students We have uh thirty-eight students second year students and thirty-two students uh who are the finalists in this institution Uh the training course uh is of a three year period or three year instructional period uh We have first years uh second year and third year In the first year the students learn uh in the current first six months they learn English medical mathematics simple sciences including biology physics chemistry and patients' care uh just to make them become much more orientated to the language which they are going to uh uh use most of the time when they go or they move into the next block The second years this is the clinical year when uh different clinical subjects are being taught to them uh subjects like environmental sanitation communicable diseases pathology surgery Uh these are the key subjects together with the pharmacology which  are the uh key subjects to make them clinically orientated so that they will go and uh help these people in the villages and we have uh after finishing after a successful finishing of the training uh these students are supposed to be posted by the ministry to different uh regions in this country uh and therefore the ministry is responsible for posting them to different regions and especially at different villages to work as village health workers Thank you \n<$A> That was Dr <name/> the centre's principal To follow in the footpaths of Dr <name/> the administrative structure now is the office of the vice principal Dr <name/> who's also the centre's academic officer who apart from his administrative duties and teaching also makes hospital rounds to attend to the patients Our second step now is to know about the regulations of recruitment of students and academic aspects of the centre Dr <name/>\n<$C> Well as a registered medical practitioner the regional medical officer of this region assigns to me some duties both in the hospital wards and in the different clinics just like other medical officers Uh in this school I'm the vice principal who assists the principal in all administrative duties and  takes over the administration in the principal's absence A vice principal is the chief academic officer so I have to study the school curriculum very effectively prepare all the class timetables allocate the teachers and tutors who come from in and outside the school as the known as part time teachers and tutors I have always to see that weekly and monthly tests are conducted as planned I also have to prepare all the student rosters which  assign them some practical duties in the hospital wards and outpatient departments and also conduct all the tutorial sessions in the hospital And also twice every year I have to move in the villages with the second and third year students to do a community survey prepare the community medicine rosters and then supervise the maternal and child health clinics in the district health uh the district healthRRR centres Uh sometimes I do face some problems particularly regarding transport uh fuel and the bad roads during the rainy seasons and sometimes shortage of food And this always points to the students that uh they would complain to the school authority that the fuel allowances are insufficient Well uh even all these are like this the success has been so nice as uh forementioned Thank you very much \n<$A> That was the vice principal of the training centre In order to ensure that there is harmony between the administrators and students there is a bridge in between in the name of warden he is <ea/>Ndugu <name/> who painstakingly follows up all issues involved How does he go about it <ea/>Ndugu <name/>\n<$D> Well on my side as a warden uh there are some responsibilities which I actually uh they My responsibility is uh are successful when I'm co-ordinating between the students and the school administration or the institutional administration Now for better co-ordination between the staff and the students that means discipline is the paramount thing which should be observed Now regarding discipline as such actually my duty is just to try and maintain and see that the students are they are in line with the school regulations uh as provided by the ministry So in short we have some regulations which I can't mention all here It might take too much time but just to point out some of the important disciplinary aspects is that we have to observe that uh students are within the school premises at defined times or that the students are following the periods as co-ordinated by our institutional co-ordinator as well as the timing maybe for meals should be punctual in such a way that they don't interfere with the uh time allocated for different periods and then not forgetting again on the disciplinary aspect is that unless the students have no problems regarding maybe studies or regarding their welfare uh so we should expect that there might be some problems Now some of the problems could be uh maybe we could say tell <lexeme> as domestic problems Now these problems could be uh something to do with the meals It could be something to do with the health It could be something to do with learning materials and even the security of the students So in all these aspects there could crop some problems and now how do I get  these problems from the the studentsRRR Now we have the as in our government we have <O/> leaders but here we have leaders in each dormitory so they are the people who are actually to some extent they are vested with the responsibility to keep some of the regulations going well and when they uh single out any problem the first person to face is going to be the warden so actually I'm getting the first hand information whenever possible But as you know sometimes the information can skip  me according to the to theRRR magnitude of the problem So on those respect there are some problems which I can solve but if there are problems which are beyond my capability then I have to send these problems to the higher administrative organ Now there could be some disciplinary behaviour such as maybe a student is too late to come or to report or maybe some students have slept out of the campus or maybe a student is not attending classes well or sometimes even the uh meal regulations or timing is not observed So all these problems they are first uh directed to me and I try to solve to my capacity and then actually most of them would be uh solved and then there is the co-ordination between students and the staff and students and the other subordinates That is again requires the co-ordination of various jobs to these subordinates uh That means I have to arrange the duties of maybe the drivers sometimes the duties for the cooks the duties for office attendance so that generally we have a calm and uh surrounding which is more or less in peace and maybe tranquillity so to say Also there are health problems that means as a warden I have to produce a roster for our clinic We have a clinic and then I have to produce a roster uh in which uh one doctor or a medical assistant is to prescribe or to take care of the sick students for a week Now this is also a co-ordination between the students and the teachers or the doctors and medical assistants Again that clinic is also uh serving our  staff the rest of the staff that means the tutors and the other subordinates In short unless there is a big problem that is when we sit together with the principal and vice principal together with the staff but in most cases I try my best to solve some problems from the students And also working hand in hand with me are the uh school council That means the students have got their leaders uh Formerly I mentioned  about> people like <O/> leaders but other than those leaders from each dormitory which are equivalent to <O/> leaders in our government set-up we have representatives from classes uh we have different we call them ministers or counsellors in different departments uh so whenever there is a problem from any faculty or any aspect uh these counsellors or these ministers they are the first to hear those problems and they might forward that problem to me and I might act according to the appropriateness of how to solve that problem In short that is what is all about my duties \n<$A> After knowing how the gap between the two sides of the centre narrows through the good offices of the warden another important link in the operations of the centre is academic work Despite the fact that the RMA training centre employs scores of teachers I've picked one on behalf of the others He is <ea/>Ndugu <name/> who teaches simple science subjects to first-year students <ea/>Ndugu <name/> is also a laboratory technician with a diploma in biochemistry Well how does he execute his several duties Listen to him narrating his story \n<$E> Uh as a tutor in this school with my qualification being a medical laboratory <.>technician technician teaching simple science clinical and clinical pathology and as simple science I'm teaching them general biology chemistry and physics This subject usually helps the student student to cope with the real medical uh subjects So long as our students are being picked let's say from uh the majority of them are primary school leavers Usually they have got uh very little knowledge little knowledgeRRR of science so in order for in order that they may they can cope with these subjects we have to teach them uh simple science And apart from teaching simple science that is I'm teaching clinical pathology This  subjects> subject> usually helps the student to make a diagnosis make a clinical diagnosis and uh it is this subject which usually uh uh helps the student to do with our work I mean after mean afterRRR qualifying this subject of clinical pathology helps the student to perform their job perfectly Apart from teaching in this school I'm also I've been also assigned other duties at the regional hospital As a medical laboratory technician with a diploma in clinical chemistry I'm doing most of the the clinical chemistry investigation at the regional hospital \n<$A> Despite teaching there are various issues which face the students in their daily undertakings A situation which requires some kind of co-ordination and organisation and cater for their interests \nS1BINT3T\n<$A> During the workshop a number of papers were presented concerning sustainable usage of pesticides in Tanzania One of the papers was on pesticides registration and control in Tanzania presented by Florence Simununa scientist with the Tropical Pesticides Research Institute TPRI In the following interview Florence Simununa explains the importance of having pesticides' registration and control in Tanzania and how the institute helps farmers on safe use of pesticides First she outlines the activities of TPRI \n<$B> Uh the main activities of Tropical Pesticides Research Institute that is TPRI uh is doing research on pesticides which are geared towards controlling economic importance first in Tanzania as well as rendering technical services related to pesticides' registration and control and in addition to that uh uh rendering services related to safe and efficient use of pesticides in Tanzania \n<$A> Uh one of the main activities of TPRI is to render registration and control Tell us what is the importance of having pesticides' registration and control \n<$B> Yeah The importance of having pesticides' registration and control in Tanzania is to reduce risks of pesticides used for man and its environment \n<$A> What is the main purpose of pesticide registration \n<$B> Yeah The main purpose of pesticides' registration is to ensure that pesticides should be used according to its direction uh warnings and the precaution without causing or posing any hazards to man and his environment or non-target organisms \n<$A> Now tell us the procedures for registration of pesticides \n<$B> Uh The main procedures for pesticides' registration are as follows uh Number one a registrant should fill in PRC one form which is application for pesticides' registration uh This form is available for fifty US dollar or equivalent Tanzanian shillings Number two a registrant should submit three copies of registration <O/> with the data and technical information of the product to be registered Number three a registrant should submit a representative sample of pesticides for laboratory and field tests and uh number five A registrant  needs to pay five hundred US dollar or equivalent Tanzanian shillings as registration fee for experimental  purposes Number six uh Registrants should pay five thousand US dollar as field testing fee and number seven uh a field report uh must be produced by a research scientist and uh this report should be uh approved by uh PARTC that is Pesticides' Approval uh Registration uh Technical Committee and TPRI Council and lastly the pesticides uh can be registered uh under provisional registration and later on the product uh can be up-graded to full registration \n<$A> Can you also tell us the registration status and the registration fees in the country \n<$B> Yeah uh There are four categories of pesticides' registration in the country uh Number one there is uh experimental registration uh Experimental registration are products for experimental purpose only which they are registered for laboratory or field tests only uh They are not meant for public use That is they cannot be sold imported manufactured formulated or used in Tanzania and uh its uh fee is five hundred US dollar or equivalent Tanzanian shillings uh The fee for experimental registration is renewable  for> every year and secondly uh the second status of uh pesticides' registration is provisional registration uh Provisional registration are products which uh are approved for general use uh for a maximum of uh for a maximum period of two years Its fee is one thousand five hundred US dollar or equivalent Tanzanian shillings uh Number three is uh restricted registration uh These are pesticides uh registered for specific target pests but uh not for general public use uh Its fee is one thousand US dollar or equivalent Tanzanian  shillings The fee is renewable for two years and lastly uh there is full registration uh Full registration are products which uh have been provisionally registered and have been in use for at least three years and are up-graded to full registration  purposes Products in this category can be imported manufactured formulated sold and used in Tanzania Its fee is five thousand US dollar or equivalent Tanzanian  shillings\n<$B> I'm sure the registration process  has some procedures for one to acquire a permit Now tell us how do you do\n<$A> Yeah First of all uh when you speak about  permits there are different types of permit uh Number one there's permit to import pesticides in the country In order to acquire such a permit first of all the type of pesticides which uh you are importing should fall under provisional registration restricted registration or full registration All products under this registration can be imported sold manufactured formulated or used uh in Tanzania And secondly uh you need to buy need to buyRRR and fill in PRC two form which is application to import a pesticide The form is available for twenty US dollar or equivalent Tanzanian shillings Then uh the importer have to pay a zero point five per cent fee import price That is import sales fee and after paying such a fee uh the permit uh to import a pesticide that is <name/> three uh is later issued In addition to that also on arrival of the imported pesticides our TPRI staff should conduct routine inspection and take samples for analysis depending on the type of packaging and formulation Other permits uh  include pesticides' business permit uh Number one there is pest controllers uh I mean including fumigation If a person wants to be a fumigator she or he has to fill in uh form PRC eight That is application for a permit to carry out fumigation and other pest control activities uh The form uh costs two twenty US dollar or equivalent Tanzanian shillings and number two a person should fill uh form PRC four That is application for clearing certificate of using or altering the registered pesticides for commercial purposes uh The form costs twenty US dollar and afterwards inspection should be conducted on the following issues uh Inspection should be conducted uh on the premises uh  equipment protective gear uh chemicals and uh staff Then according to inspection report a registrar could either issue a permit or not And number two uh a permit to carry out uh to sell pesticides that is uh retailers A person should fill in form PRC nine That is application for a permit to deal with pesticides on retail uh basis The form is issued free of charge and secondly a person has to fill in form PRC four That is application of clearance certificate of using or altering a registered  pesticides for commercial purposes uh The form costs US dollar twenty or equivalent Tanzanian shillings Then inspection of uh premises  equipment protective gear chemicals and staff should be conducted and a permit is issued according to inspection report by a registrar and lastly there's a permit to manufacture or formulate pesticides uh A person uh  needs to fill in form PRC ten That is application for a permit to formulate or manufacture a pesticide uh This form is issued free of charge and later on inspection  of the uh premises  equipment protective gear laboratory chemicals and the staff uh should be conducted and uh according to inspection report uh a scheme is either granted or not The scheme could not be granted a permit \n<$B> Do you have specific qualifications for one to acquire a permit\n<$A> Yeah I mean a person should meet the required standards in order to uh acquire a permit \n<$B> The other objective of the Tropical Pesticides Research Institute is to carry out research on pesticides and I know most of those who are using pesticides are in the rural areas I mean the farmers Now how do you communicate with them \n<$B> Yeah uh We communicate with target group that is farmers uh through conducting seminars on the safe and  efficient use of pesticides uh to farmers and secondly uh we conduct uh pest management  courses uh to pesticides' dealers on the pesticides' registration use uh and control of pesticides at TPRI uh We therefore expect uh when such people go to their respective places they'll be able to disseminate uh such knowledge and information they gathered at TPRI uh to farmers and thirdly uh TPRI has prepared a programme to explain to public its activities uh including the safe and  efficient use of pesticides in Tanzania We therefore expect to broadcast uh this programme very soon uh in Radio Tanzania so that especially farmers will understand what uh we are doing at TPRI and lastly uh we disseminate such information through research findings Findings uh are published uh in various papers which uh such information could be easily disseminated by uh say extension officers uh to the farmers in the rural areas \n<$B> Let us now go back to the registration process I would like you to give us more elaboration on how you make a follow-up to ensure that the registered pesticide which is intended for public use is the one which is imported \n<$A> On the  arrival of uh imported pesticides uh TPRI staff uh usually conduct inspection and take samples say three to five for every twenty uh kilogram or twenty thousand uh litres depending on the type of packing and formulation uh The main purpose of taking samples is to perform analysis in order to verify quality of the pesticides being imported in the country \n<$B> We have been talking about the TPRI and the farmer but what is the main relationship between uh TPRI and the farmer because TPRI is making a research on pesticides and the farmer is just a person who is cultivating the land Now what is the main relationship \n<$B> uh What Tropical Pesticides Research Institute that is TPRI doing uh We are conducting research on different pesticides against uh economic pests uh The findings uh which we get through research findings uh are used as a guideline to the farmers and actually uh the findings  indicate which type of pesticides could be used to bring  a> significant or positive results against economic pests which we believe uh through such information the farmer can be uh can get an advantage\n<$B> Some pesticides flourines like sulphur which is mostly used by cashnut growers are said to have acid which is harmful  to the land What is your advice to the farmers Should they continue using it \n<$A> uh Yeah There are various reasons which can cause uh a pesticide to be harmful uh and one of them uh for example if a pesticide is not used according to its direction We therefore expect that uh such kind of pesticides could bring harmful effects to uh the person who is using it and its environment Therefore before making any conclusion we need to make investigation whether what the farmer farmers uh uh the farmer's complaining is true uh In this way we will be in a better position to advise farmers Meanwhile farmers should seek advice through their relevant agricultural officers that is at regional and the district level uh in their respective regions \n<$B> uh Some people are complaining that pesticides affect the health of the farmers but whether we like it or not the pesticides will continue to be imported for public use Now what are your comments to the clients \n<$A>Yeah You mean uh the advice to farmers on the safe use of pesticides in Tanzania \n<$B> Of course \n<$A> uh Okay farmers should be educated on different issues uh related to safe and efficience efficient use of pesticides in Tanzania through uh radio programmes As I have said before that TPRI uh uh has prepared a programme to explain to the public uh the kind of activities which occurred at TPRI and uh we expect that uh most farmers uh will get uh useful information and secondly uh such information could be disseminated to farmers through TV For those who have TV and magazine seminars and uh conducting different courses As I have said before at TPRI uh we are conducting a pesticide a pest management course uh which was started in nineteen ninety-three The main purpose of uh this course is uh to inform pesticides' dealers uh on the safe and efficient use of pesticides uh in Tanzania and as I have mentioned before we expect that because pesticides' dealers they usually uh have  a> contact with farmers through selling of their products sometimes in the rural area So we expect that they will be able to uh disseminate such information to farmers The things which they have learned from TPRI uh they'll be able to uh disseminate to farmers uh in the rural areas And lastly I would like to say that the farmers should always seek advice uh  from experts or people who will assist them on the safe and efficient use of pesticides in Tanzania And also I would like would like to encourage farmers to use uh integrated pest management uh You see you cannot only depend on uh using pesticides to control uh pests uh Farmers should also use other uh ways of controlling pests such as biological means physical means and etcetera \nS1BINT4T\n<$A> We present Women's Half Hour Welcome once again to another edition of Women's Half Hour Today we bring you an interview with <ea/>Ndugu Chito Ram chairperson of the national committee on traditional practices affecting the health of women and children about female genital mutilation Female genital mutilation is one of the traditional practices which is said to affect the health of women and children Female genital mutilation is still practised in most African countries including Tanzania In this programme today are interviewed <ea/>Ndugu Chito Ram chairperson of the national committee on traditional practices affecting the health of women and children <ea/>Ndugu Chito will talk about among other issues measures taken by the committee to eliminate female genital mutilation the recommendations made for female genital mutilation to enrich the African platform for action at the Dakar conference and how female genital mutilation affects a woman in terms of her welfare and development She begins by telling us how is the situation in Tanzania so far as regards female genital mutilation \n<$B> The situation of female genital mutilation in Tanzania uh is a bit bright in the sense that we have started to embark on the campaign against female genital mutilation in one region that is Dodoma region and in Tanzania out of the twenty-five regions twenty uh seven regions out of twenty mainland practise female genital mutilation This equals to thirty-three point three per cent of the population so the situation we will call it bad but not grave and uh fortunately we have received some funds from IWDA that is International Women Development Agency from Australia and we have started on the sensitisation project against female genital mutilation in Dodoma region which so far from last year nineteen ninety-four the situation appears to be very encouraging in a sense that out of the four  districts in Dodoma we have reached in those four districts forty villages that is ten  villages in each district and then we have sensitised whom we call our focus group  discussants or  facilitators and we have conducted seminars  for them and in the grassroot level so these people in return are sensitising their fellow villagers on the adverse effect of uh female genital mutilation uh As you are aware I'm we are calling it FGM because it's not circumcision A woman has not no organ to be circumcised except she's being mutilated \n<$A> uh <ea/>Mama Chito you  were one among the participants at the Dakar conference and the FGM was one of the key issues which was discussed at length What can you say about the discussion Has it shown that FGM in Tanzania is a big problem compared to other African countries \n<$B> uh other African countries or you will find the whole population of that country is practising FGM So in Tanzania it's seven regions out of twenty so that is not a very bad situation indeed and uh in Tanzania they wait until the girl is about ten years old or after they have started their menstrual period whereas other countries in West Africa they mutilate a baby a child when they are just one year old or two years old and that is most cruel It is cruel even to do it on a twelve-year-old child but it is worse when you do it on one and a half year child So our situation is not as bad as in other parts of Africa \n<$A> The problem is now on the increase and of course it needs immediate action to stop it So what recommendations have you made to enrich the African platform for action which will be discussed in Beijing \n<$B> In Dakar we strongly uh condemned and recommended this horrendous and cruel practice should stop as the government leaders or heads of state have uh they should adhere to the convention of the right of the child and to the convention of uh human rights so as they have signed all those  conventions they should adhere to those  conventions and institute laws to prohibit this prohibit thisRRR practice and also for those who violate this human basic human right they should be punished severely We said this practice is very dehumanising to women and when you dehumanise a person they feel they are worthless human beings or creatures they feel they have no use or purpose in this world therefore their role is to remain inferior so this we condemned in Dakar very much and we forwarded our areas of concern to be discussed at the Beijing meeting in September this year \n<$A> The fifth African regional conference on women held in Dakar Senegal in the mid of November last year revealed that some women in the West African states Sierra Leone in particular have now made female genital mutilation  as> a project to earn their daily bread What are <ea/>Ndugu Chito's opinions on this \n<$B> Well it is true in Tanzania also It is true in Tanzania also because those people who practise or who are the perpetrators of this FGM practice they get a lot of money for doing one FGM For example in one village we were told the person gets up to ten thousand shillings for doing FGM on one child On top of that they will get a cow or a goat or chicken and many other  presents flour maize flour or a sack of maize etcetera etcetera You name it they get it They're the most well-fed well-dressed and to them this is an  economic trade or  economic venture So uh in our groups of  facilitators one was FGM practitioner and she said now you people are going to make me very poor because I have got to lay down the tool and actually this lady her name is <name/> and she is in <name/> village in Dodoma she was very open about it very positive about it She said I was doing it to other people's children but I didn't do it to my own children Neither will I ever do it to my own children but now she has vowed to work hand in hand with our national committee on traditional practice to work  towards abolishing this terrible practice of mutilating young female girls \n<$A> Okay coming back to the African platform for action Now how the national committee on harmful practices will implement what you have recommended on the African platform for action before the Beijing conference \n<$B> Yes another recommendation at Dakar was that every government should be asked to institute or enact a law to prohibit this practice so one way which we are going to work through is the Ministry of Health Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare and Youth and Ministry of Community Development Women and Children's  Affairs including Ministry of Justice so that uh we can be instrumental in bringing this change in those harmful traditional practice because this is one of those harmful practices which needs to be abolished but we will preserve the beneficial traditional practices \n<$A> You have started with Dodoma alone Now what are your strategies to enable your service to or to extend your service to other centres the other seven regions \n<$B> Our next strategy is to proceed to Singida region which also out of the three districts two  districts practise this harmful practice of uh FGM namely Manyoni district including Itigi and all the suburbs around it Singida urban and Singida rural It's only Iramba district which does not practise FGM So this is our next target \n<$A> I understand earlier you told us some of the measures which have been taken by the committee to eliminate the practice Has it been successful  in those areas you introduced the project \n<$B> Yes we have made follow-up in all those villages where we spotted the facilitators and whom we gave them orientation  seminars by uh conducting role plays and community involvement So we made a follow up and by asking first the community themselves whether these facilitators after their seminars they have done any job and even from a small child we were told the facilitator has been very busy conducting meetings and condemning FGM practice So we feel that they are doing a very good job of advocacy for us and very good campaign against FGM in their area and also we went to the community and asked this season has there been any circumcised child or circumcision ceremony which accompany this FGM practice They were all very scared and they  said no because this facilitator is very aggressive and the village leadership or government of the village is very very strict If any parent is caught then they are taken to the local gathering there and they are either fined or they are even taken to the district courts So we feel that uh something is really being done not just through words but through deeds as well and it is through collaboration of the whole village leadership as well as district leadership \n<$A> And now tell us in brief how FGM affects a woman in terms of her welfare and development as well \n<$B> First of all there are uh immediate effects Then there are mid-term effects Then there are long-term effects The immediate effects is profuse haemorrhage or excessive bleeding at the time when the cut is made to circumcise her or to mutilate her external genitalia By external genitalia what is being circumcised is the whole clitoris and the two labia minora so the girl can bleed profusely even she can faint or death could occur immediately and then oedema of the whole circumcised or excised area until it obscures her ability to urinate or to pass urine and then the bladder gets extended or distended and then she can't urinate then she gets infected and after that she can get very high fever etcetera Then mid-term effect is from that scarring tissue which heals now there's a big fibrous or a big celloid A big celloid is a big scar like potato which forms on the genitalia and then it again obscures even her menstrual flow her urination and uh when she grows up even coitus with the spouse or the husband will be very painful and very difficult for her Now the long-term effect when she now  conceives during labour this scarring tissue will be so hard and it won't give way by stretching as the vulva does uh under normal circumstances during labour so the baby's head is delayed to be delivered and she keeps on pushing she gets herself exhausted until she may have a very bad uh vaginal and perennial tear which can extend up to the anus and then cause many many other  manifestations like uh what we call <O/> vaginal fistula or recto-vaginal fistula whereby the tear has extended from vagina urinary tract up to the anal tract so the urine and faeces will be mixing together and this is a very very painful and traamatic experience both physically and mentally and the healing also is very painful because they may have to undergo operations about two operations or three operations in order to cure this condition completely or sometimes they never get uh cured completely So here the mother is affected and the unborn baby is also affected The baby may get brain damage By getting the brain damage the baby will be born mentally retarded or even get a dead baby So the baby can be still-born as we call it or a dead baby on hand so these are all disastrous to the mother \n<$A> uh some people say that the female genital mutilation can also lead to divorce Is that not a loss on part of a life \n<$B> Well it is because when one gets married the objective is to lead a happy normal everlasting life not to end in uh divorce or disaster like that So it is very traumatic psychologically socially sexually and uh from any aspect of uh one's normal life it is disastrous \n<$A> uh <ea/>Mama Chito I'm also interested to know how you approach the women the <ea/>njakangas those old <ea/>bibis who are supposed to mutilate our young girls I think it is difficult to convince them to stop the practice isn't it \nS1BINT5T\n<$A> In this week's programme we carry an interview with Mr Ladislaus Salema the general manager of the National Engineering Company NECO and also President of the Institution of Engineers in Tanzania In this conversation with Radio Tanzania's Eda Sanga Mr Salema dwells on a wide range of activities related to the National Engineering Company the engineering profession in Tanzania and its contribution to the national economy\n<$B> uh The National Engineering Company sometimes referred as NECO was established in July nineteen sixty-seven uh as a result of nationalisation of a business formerly owned by a Dutch company known shortly as TOM Now TOM owned a machine shop and a foundry and TOM was engaged basically in uh repair of uh various pieces of equipment from the industrial sector mostly from the sisal industries So after nationalisation in nineteen sixty-nine the TOM business was also amalgamated with <name/> who was basically engaged in steel construction So the National Engineering Company of today has uh three main activities It has a steel fabrication and erection section a machine shop and a foundry Now in the steel fabrication we are mostly engaged in the production of uh fuel storage tanks building of depots construction of steel bridges trusses grain girders and various other steel fabrications In the machine shop we are involved with machining various components for industrial spare parts and some components that are required in our own constructions particularly of uh the fuel storage facilities We are able to produce cast iron castings steel castings and <O/> castings Now we produce parts that are required in the industry as spare parts but sometimes as components for assembly of new products and we undertake repair services uh parts that are required to be reconditioned particularly for motor vehicles in our machine shop So in short those are many areas of our <O/> and as to how relevant they are to the country economy I don't need to emphasise that fuel storage and distribution is very very important to the functioning of our economy and the NECO is the biggest key-player in Tanzania in as far as construction and storage facilities are concerned And we do produce spare parts for instance for a ginnery which are used for the ginning of cotton We do produce spare parts for the sugar mills We do produce components sometimes even for the breweries\n<$C> Taking into account that this company started immediately after the nationalisation process in nineteen sixty-seven and looking at where we are now uh would you say the company is operating to its set aims and objectives\n<$B> uh After nationalisation what was inherited was basically all the pieces of equipment and there has been rehabilitation particularly in nineteen seventy-nine and eighty-two period in the steel shops and in the foundry and the capacity of steel fabrication was then raised considerably so that to date we are able to fabricate on a single-shift basis up to one thousand two hundred pounds a year Our fabricators of steel And with the recent investment on the induction furnace we can comfortably produce about a thousand pounds of castings a year Now this makes NECO foundry one of the biggest This makes our steel fabrication section one of the biggest in the country And uh there has been a gradual replacement of some pieces of equipment also in the machine shop but we still are really short of the many equipment that we require to be more competitive particularly in the now unfolding market situation particularly in the machining area But we are confident that we will be able to uh make these investments in the future and we are confident that we shall be able to grow We have been operating on profit since nineteen seventy-six to date and we have been in the competitive market <O/> another time when Tanzania was only planned economy we were competing with even external firms so we are confident that the National Engineering Company should be able to survive We are also looking ahead towards maybe some kind of co-operation with people or firms with higher technology levels so that we can move in new products\n<$C> Would you know how big your staff is and how much is local and how much is uh maybe foreign\n<$B> Well we are about three hundred and fifty people uh with about twenty-four engineers and uh we are all local all Tanzanians We've had  an> assistance from Germany since nineteen seventy-five to nineteen ninety We have had uh this assistance starting with eleven expatriates in various areas of engineering and management uh reduced gradually to about three in nineteen ninety and then it phased out completely So now we are hundred per cent local and we are managing\n<$C> Do you have a working relationship with the Engineering Faculty of the University of Dar es Salaam\n<$B> Yes yes we work quite closely with the Engineering Faculty in the sense that we do send our people to consult the experts there sometimes We also have a kind of programme going on with experts in production particularly of castings in the foundry who come to advise us on how to improve our quality and on personal basis we know most of the professors and senior lecturers in the university so we have this kind of interaction uh even on <+_a> personal basis\n<$C> Since you are the biggest in the country and in your capacity as President of the Institution of Engineers in Tanzania there has been of late some discontentment on the part of the public on the performance of engineers in Tanzania Would you have any comment\n<$B> uh I would would sayRRR say the public is justified to be to feel concerned feel concernedRRR  about the performance of the engineers in the country but I would hasten to add that the public has not been fully informed and we are trying now in our engineering promotion activities to get the public informed of the role of engineers in Tanzania uh what they have done and what is happening because basically the discontent you might be now hearing about is uh on the road construction and uh most of it most of this is not really done by local engineers Most of this is done by foreign firms or locally registered firms but which are not really local in nature And we have also discussed this as an institution with the Minister of Works for instance trying to see how we can upgrade the locally registered contractors for instance so that they can improve their performance to avoid this uh discontent from the public which in my opinion is quite fair The public has a right to demand to get uh the service that they are really paying for\n<$C Would you say you're facing problems of maintaining the engineers that you have you trained you know those who go for greener pastures elsewhere\n<$B> Well occasionally we will have somebody wanting to change a job basically because of better  remuneration elsewhere uh but I would say the situation in the national engineering is stable uh because I think there is more job content more engineering in NECO and it's more satisfying too if one is really intending to develop a career in engineering it's more satisfying to work uh for an engineering firm for an engineer instead of just running out to some people who might pay you better but not give you very very good challenging jobs But on the whole engineers in this country are not as well paid as they should be In fact I should say they are not even considered along with other professionals Well I don't want to complain about doctors getting better pay than engineers but I thought when the government was considering professionals like doctors they should actually think of engineers because no other profession and I repeat no other profession can operate without engineers\n<$B> In terms of uh spare parts uh Mr Salema how did you come to innovate the department of making of spare parts so that the country at one point is self-sustaining instead of using foreign exchange to import these spare parts\n<$C> Now spare part production spare part production or component production I would say isn't very very old thing in the country and many many companies have started by A getting a component a broken component or one-out component and trying to copy it and then produce one and try to fit it and this has been quite difficult In fact it is the wrong way of doing it The right way of doing it would be to get a drawing an engineering drawing from the designer with all the specifications including material specification and then produce according to the specifications That way is a better way a surer way of making sure that you produce the right part But you see as you know most of the equipment in this country is very old and even when it's new drawings are not normally made available We import a lot of machines to this country but nobody has ever demanded that as part of the supply contract drawings should be supplied for spare parts So people have been importing equipment and the only thing they have managed to have is a manual for parts so they could continue to order Now we have international company attempted to make spare parts using <O/> metals copying the sample where when they are available using the drawings or where a new sample is available taking the new sample for user drawing and use the drawing use the drawing>-/> for producing the parts and sometimes even reuse the drawing on a repetitive order But I must say that uh the country as a whole the production of components of spare parts is still a long long way towards fulfilling the demand for there isn't that information of the spares that are required It's simply not available People talk about we need spare parts but if you ask them do you have the drawing which are the spare parts you want what are the material specifications they wouldn't know they wouldn't know so it's quite difficult it's quite difficult to really go fully into the import substitution for spare parts in the country in the near future \n<$C> uh Talking about these components and spare parts how is the market system because uh one of the complaint has always been that when you buy a locally made component or spare part it is sometimes more expensive than the one that has been imported from abroad\n<$B> It could actually be true but it could also be untrue A bit true because if you are ordering a casting and you only want one piece or two pieces the cost of producing these two pieces is certainly going to be very high because the process is the same as if you order a thousand pieces So because you have to make a pattern you have to make a mould uh you'll have to make a drawing maybe the process is the same for one part as it is for one thousand parts So if you had large quantities the price is going to be low and uh if we had if a certain optimum quantity is ordered the prices local prices are usually very low in comparison with imports uh On the question of quality it could also be true but it could also be untrue If the order did specify the specifications were given on the material and the dimensions were correctly given I see no problem in one producing  castings particularly the simple  castings like cast iron or steel castings to the required specification and dimensions uh the <->the I'm saying I've started by saying it could be true and it could be untrue It could be untrue in the sense that people get used to importing spare parts People have been importing spare parts since the beginning of time in this country and people are reluctant to change People won't accept this change So people would still want to go back to their old suppliers The suppliers who have been selling are pressurising to sell so it's easy to jump by and say look we don't want the spare parts because they are poor quality and we should import but a number of  professions we have established that local some local spare parts are even of higher quality than some imported spare parts\nS1BINT6T\n<$A> This is Face the Mike and welcome to the programme Many people including Tanzanians are perhaps unfamiliar with Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology a public organ which was established by the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology Act Number Seven of nineteen eighty-six Formally known as the Tanzania National Scientific Research Council this parastatal organisation effectively and efficiently co-ordinates and promotes scientific research and technology development in Tanzania and also acts as chief advisor to government on science and technology policy and on all matters pertaining to the development of science and technology in their application to social economic development in the country With this background in mind why a commission for science and technology Why is this discipline key to the development of any nation These are but a few of the many questions I asked the Director General of Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology Professor Abdul Rachman Salim Msangi But first why is science and technology so important in the development of mankind\n<$B> The wealth and the development of a nation is much more dependent on the level and application of science and technology in that country and that is why today we find that the rich and developed countries of the world are not those with rich natural resources but those with a very high level of science and technology development A typical example is uh if we compare say our country Tanzania and Japan From the natural resources point of view Tanzania is very much richer than Japan in almost all aspects of natural resources agricultural and mineral uh water resources and so on but it's everybody's knowledge that Japan is a much more developed country today than Tanzania and the simple reason is that Japan is very much more advanced scientifically and technologically than Tanzania\n<$A> Then what efforts has Tanzania done in ensuring that science and technology receives the attention it deserves Do you think that these efforts are adequate If not what do you think should be done to improve the situation\n<$B> Well Tanzania uh compared to other III develop developing countries in Africa I think can be said to be putting a reasonable effort in the development and application of science and technology as an important means for socio-economic development Uh I wouldn't say that the effort is adequate because we are very far behind when we are compared to well other newly developed countries or countries which are generally grouped as developing like ourselves uh like Korea uh India and such like countries South American  countries like Brazil These are grouped with us as developing countries but they're far more advanced than us because their science and technology capability is more advanced than ours uh The uh awareness of the importance of science and technology uh as a means for socio-economic development in Tanzania uh began only about uh two decades ago The both the Organisation of African Unity OAU and also the United Nations in various fora during the past two decades have been emphasising the need for countries to devote a reasonable amount of their financial resources towards the development of science and technology in the form of science and technology education in the form of scientific and technological uh research institutions and also in the application of scientific research to economic development activities Uh currently Tanzania is spending just about zero point five per cent of its gross  national product  on the development of science and technology and this is far less than was recommended a decade ago in nineteen-eighty by the Lagos plan of action which uh agreed that member countries of the OAU should as soon as possible provide for at least one per cent of the GNP towards the development of science and technology and Tanzania was a signatory to this agreement So the pith of it is that more than a decade later well we still haven't achieved even half of that target So this is the situation at present Tanzania amongst other developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa is still lagging far behind the the target that was recommended by the Organisation of African Unity and by the United Nations uh Conference on Science and Technology for Development\n<$A> And uh what is the problem apart from the fact that we don't have the resources What other problems are there\n<$B> Well the other uh resources themselves in the way of say finance is not adequate You have to have uh adequate scientific and technological manpower and this manpower can only be generated from university institutions and the university institutions are supported by the school uh uh the school programmes so that uh a balanced science and technology development in the country requires first that we have you have good a very good school system right from the primary through the secondary to the tertiary level so that your scientific manpower very strong background in science and technology. Now in almost all these levels we need to pull up our socks very much Uh at present time we have something like I think a hundred fifty to two hundred scientists and technologists per one million of the population and the target set by the United Nations is that you can only have meaningful science and technology development in the country if you have something like two hundred thousand scientists and technologists to one million of the population So we have a very long way to go\n<$A> Would that be the reason maybe why the government at last in the nineteen nineties has decided to amalgamate higher education with science and technology\n<$B> Yes I think this is one of the main reasons uh The creation of a Ministry of Science Technology and Higher Education is in fact a response  of government  to a recommendation that was made by the Tanzania scientific and technological uh community in a national workshop that was held in Arusha in eighteen in nineteen eighty-five which recommended among other things that in order to enhance the development and application of science and technology in the country it was necessary even though the workshop realised at that time that uh the country was facing several uh problems economic development problems but still thought that science and technology was so vital was such a vital factor a vital stimulus in the development of science and technology that uh even though the situation was not so favourable in the country it was necessary for such a ministry to be created So the Tanzania science and technology uh community are very grateful very appreciative to government that at last it has heeded to this uh recommendation\n<$A> Normally as a rule uh science subjects in schools maybe beginning from secondary level up to higher level is considered to be a dull subject is considered to be difficult and people many people actually students don't want to associate themselves with the subject As a result maybe uh we've performed poorly in this area Is there a way that uh the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology could come up with innovative ways of teaching this subject so that it is interesting and attracts more students\n<$B> Yes as a matter of fact we are already doing something in that direction in that we uh sponsor uh school science competitions through the Tanzania uh Science Teachers Association They hold uh exhibitions annually for secondary schools whereby the secondary school students uh display their capability in uh scientific subjects uh all scientific subjects biology chemistry physics mathematics uh and we help them in giving prizes to the winners This has been a very great stimulus to the uh uh developing of interest in science uh in secondary schools uh Recently also we've been uh co-operating with uh uh what they call science camps This is an activity that was recently developed by the University of Dar es Salaam whereby they go out into the country and hold camps for primary schools secondary schools whereby they do various scientific activities uh it could be collecting materials from the environment from the land from the sea and examining these under the microscopes and trying to relate how these organisms that they've collected uh grw and how they are adapted to the environment from which they were collected\n<$A> Now I also understand that uh our country has already evolved a national science and technology policy Could you elaborate and highlight on this policy\n<$B> Yeah uh the science and technology policy I think was uh passed in nineteen uh worked out in nineteen eighty-five and was uh uh incorporated into the national economic development policy in the following year With the uh policy simply says that in view of the fact that socio-economic development is dependent on the application of science and technology that all uh national economic development plans should include a chapter on science and technology as a support base Uh if we take for example the uh policy on agricultural development then we all know that in so far as the current national economic development plan is concerned agriculture is given the highest priority I think rightly so It allocates I think thirty per cent of the GNP and uh the we uh the scientific and economical community of the country are saying in order to make that policy meaningful we must also say that the bulk of science and technology research and development effort should be equally uh biased That is to say the bulk of it the bulk of research and development activities should also go the lion share should go to agricultural production Uh that is to say research aimed at enhancing agricultural production Industry and energy I think is the next one and uh twenty per cent or so and we are saying the same that that is to say that the national economic development plan should be parallel to the national science and technology policy\n<$A> Now as a nation I'm sure you'll agree with me Professor Msangi that uh we don't have a culture such that uh takes us uh to be in harmony with science and technology Now as the Director General of the institution that has been charged with the responsibility of promoting science and technology in the country and facilitating the evolution of a science and technology culture in the general public can you explain how you're going to carry out these functions\nB: Well first of all uh the development uh of science and technology the in the uh national institutions like I said before we try to influence the science and technology activities in schools uh in universities we as I said helped finance science uh and technology shows for schools or science camps uh uh In the uh general population we have as one of those activities that are aimed to encourage and help to develop a science and technology culture in the general population we annually uh try to identify amongst the  Tanzanian population at all levels people who have indicated uh that they have a capability in science and technology uh It might be ordinary people who RRR whohave who are innovative who have devised uh mechanisms of or devices appliances for easing say human labour uh appliances for replacing imported uh products and when we recognise such talents we encourage them to develop by uh providing a reward to the innovators So we give what uh we call uh Tanzania Award for Scientific and Technological Achievement If we can uh uh if we get a person in even uh a lay person who has made some uh appreciable innovation we recommend these people for the award and this award is given uh on May Day the first of May each year by the President of the United Republic and this is how we encourage uh the development of science and technology culture in the community\n<$A> Uh but there are some people again from the public who complain that uh awards to these uh people who have made some innovations simply end up as awards You don't hear a much about them later on as a way of follow-up whether they've done something more uh I mean some advancement to where they were uh whether whatever technology they have put  on the market is appropriate whether they are finding any problems as far as marketing is concerned whether information is trickling down to the people who need that technology What do you have to say about this\n<$B> Well it's not very easy it's not so easy for a theoretical model to be put into practice It takes time but we're doing something about that uh\nS1BINT7T\n<$A> This is Face the Mike and facing the mike today is Professor L K Shayo International Village for Science and Technology Project Co-ordinator Perhaps to begin our discussion Professor you could tell us why International Village for Science and Technology in this country\n<$B> Well uh I think this village has come about as a result of our experiences over several years uh and especially our experiences uh in the in our participation uh in the activities of the International International Centre for Theoretical Physics which is in Triest Uh we have proved beyond doubt that uh when a scientist or a technologist or in fact any thinker gets a place where he or she can concentrate the results of such concentration are really very encouraging uh Our experiences show that whereas for example we have been teaching in the University of Dar es Salaam for uh a long time and even if you take the uh experiences of other scientists who've been teaching in African universities you find that a lot of the work they have done in research a of a lot of the breakthroughs have been done outside in an environment which is conducive to discovery and innovation And the idea of creating this village is precisely to to provide such an environment to our scientists and technologists\n<$A> Perhaps you could uh give us some more insights as to what is the environment like\n<$B> Uh maybe very briefly the village is uh one could imagine a village to be uh a botanical garden a very large botanical garden Inside of that garden will be various institutions Uh there will be two types of institutions one is a tiny wing of the village which will be composed of uh schools uh for talented children and innovators Then there'll be the research's wing which will be uh aimed at those people who have already completed their training and they are uh maybe doing they're working in various institutions like the universities or research institutions and they will be coming to the village to do research in the various research centres Uh there will be research centres in all disciplines of science and technology uh maybe not a <O/> as I've said uh I could mention just a few There will be an international uh centre for physics chemistry biology biotechnology uh an international centre for science equipment There will be an international centre for A-sciences and uh for mathematical sciences Uh these are just some of the few centres which will be in the village And each of these centres will actually be uh in a mini forest When you are in any one of these centres it will be completely isolated from the rest in terms of uh you'll not be able to see the other centres when you are in any one of the one of theRRR centres\n<$A> Uh I'm just wondering why you decided to call it international village and maybe not international centre\n<$B> Well uh it's because it's a village I mean the way it is uh envisaged is to be a village It's a village of centres Okay The the village is going to be a village of international centres So that's basically why we call it international village but maybe let me say the word international is there because this village is going to be uh open to all peoples of the world I mean specifically from Africa but really it is open to everybody\n<$A> So you are giving me the impression that the village has not as yet started operating\n<$B> Uh well it has started operating in a sense because uh over the last uh four years we've been mounting international workshops at the University of Dar es Salaam as preliminary activities to the village Uh we have for example uh already located the uh physical space for the village We have also uh some offices at the International Conference Centre in Arusha for the village So really it has started but of course we have to start uh in phases and what we are doing now is really to set up the infrastructure to get ready to continue with our activities\n<$A> Uh now since you began some four years back what are the hitches some of the hitches that you have uh encountered\n<$B> Uh by hitches you mean uh setbacks or\n<$A> Yeah constraints\n<$B> constraints\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B>Of course there have been several constraints because uh the first constraint really has been uh a constraint in our desire to build a village in people's minds first because uh we were really struggling to build this village in the people's minds so that we can get the necessary support Uh of course we have been using Radio Tanzania and the newspapers and giving uh various public lectures here and there uh but still we are really are reallyRRR not we've really not managed to reach everybody and I think even a programme like this one is one of those\n<$A> Uh yeah well I understand that uh in Tanzania we have a lot of research institutions and uh technology programmes or projects going on How are you going I mean as International Village for Science and Technology how are you going to complement efforts with these research institutions in the country so that there is no uh duplication of efforts\n<$B> Uh the village is going to provide what cannot be provided under the existing infrastructure Uh we don't have an infrastructure at the present that can provide a person with uh a continuous uninterrupted period of concentration Uh you see I normally compare research and innovation to uh the process of drilling for oil I mean when you drill for oil or even if you drill for water uh you find that the deeper you drill the harder it gets but then you but you have to dig deep enough to actually get the oil or the water So we are in a situation whereby the environment which we live in does not really allow for deep digging in terms of innovation Uh therefore the village will provide really what cannot be provided by the existing infrastructure not only in Tanzania but the whole of Africa I believe So that's one way and uh we are going to complement the efforts of these institutions by providing a place where the visitors and the scientists and technologists in these institutions can actually visit the village for extended periods of say one month three months six months to complete whatever they may have been they may have started wherever they are Uh I can give an example for example a professor in the University of Dar es Salaam or Sokoine University of Agriculture who has has an idea or who has uh done something but he needs a period of uh an uninterrupted period of time He can come to the village to complete whatever he's done uh In order to ensure that we don't have duplication we have uh we really uh involved the institutions of higher learning in the in writing of the memorandum in the course of the association of the village which is really the constitution that guides the village Uh in our membership the University of Dar es Salaam is a member of the village the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology the Sokoine University of Agriculture there they were they are members of the village and this was done deliberately in order to make sure that there is no duplication That is the objectives of the village do not duplicate the objectives of these institutions And all along we intend to uh operate with uh to incorporate all institutions which are dealing with research and innovation in this country uh The Tanzania the Ministry of Science and Technology uh Science Technology and Higher Education will also be involved In fact we have also we have talked to the minister and the he is fully in support of the initiative Uh in short really we are trying to ensure that we don't duplicate the efforts of the institutions rather we complement those efforts in that we try to make uh whatever those institutions were created for be realised in more concrete terms\n<$A> Do you have uh specific policies that will govern the running and operation of the International Village for Science and Technology\n<$B> Uh maybe if you elaborate by policies what do you mean\n<$A> I mean uh whether you're going to be a non-governmental or you're going to be a department within the Ministry of Higher Education and Science and Technology\n<$B> Well uh the village has been registered as a non-governmental international organisation uh That was necessary because there's no way you're going to have an international organisation as as a department of a ministry or a department of any institution in a country uh That was necessary also in order to make sure that the village can actually uh have minimum bureaucracy uh Really bureaucracy is one of the things which really make people unable to move Uh maybe if I elaborate there It is our feeling that if for example a scientist were to make an innovation in the village that maybe gives the village ten million US dollars Well the village wouldn't mind to give the guy maybe even a million dollars I mean there's no doubt about it But I think if you are in a bureaucratic institution or if you are a department of a ministry or a department of uh another institution I think such things may not be possible because of bureaucracy uh Our aim is to make sure that a scientist or a technologist when he  comes or she comes to the village he or she is completely free uh in terms of his brain is completely free to discover and is not impeded by anything at all This is really our ultimate goal And I think this is the is theRRR environment which our counterparts in developed countries are having uh People in Japan in United States in Britain they're having the scientists there They have these environments and that's why they are making a lot of discoveries uh And when our people go there they also make breakthroughs In fact some of them when they go there to do their PhDs they get do better than their counterparts there but only when they come back home when I mean home I don't mean just Tanzania but all over the Third World when they go back home they find that they cannot continue this research or even if they continue they really don't make the breakthroughs which their counterparts who completed their studies abroad with them uh do So the point of departure is after completing our studies Otherwise as far as the brains are concerned I think each country has its own uh uh brains it has its own uh uh talents I think the if for example one were to do a a statistical analysis of the distribution of talents on earth I'm sure one would really find that the distribution is the same But then the point of departure is after finishing training\n<$A> You mentioned uh innovators and uh discoverers performing better in uh other environments I mean other than in Tanzania\n<$B> Or in Africa\n<$A> Okay in Africa uh In your International Village for Science and Technology how are you going to motivate these uh innovators and discoverers because past experience has shown that uh these people end up getting the prizes and then you don't hear anything else about them\n<$B> Uh I think uh that's one of the problems we want to solve because giving a person a prize by itself does not really uh I mean that's a temporary thing uh with us we are having the continuity that the village is always there and whenever you've something to discover you are invited to the village So that the innovator even if the innovator gets a reward for a discovery today he knows he can go there tomorrow and do the same and get the same uh uh uh reward I think the problem of giving a prize for a single invention and forgetting is uh it is uh I think it cannot be avoided so long as we continue with uh the present situation uh the What I'm saying is that the scientist or the technologist will know that there is a place where I can go and bang my head and uh I I'll be rewarded accordingly uh because really uh of course innovations uh an innovation  depends There are uh innovations which are not uh marketable but really if you can do an innovation that is marketable you should be able to rely on that innovation for the rest of your life \nS1BINT8T\n<$A> However up to the end of nineteen eighty-one the plant was administered by both the Ministry of health and National Chemical Industries so as to facilitate the smooth transfer This event marked the beginning of the plant as a parastatal conducted <O/> on a commercial basis rather than a non-profit service\n<$B> Now in a nutshell <name/> how many divisions are there within the administrative network of the company\n<$A> Well we have First we have the production department I mean We have the production department Well we have two divisions the tabletting divisions and the divisions concerned with the production of infusions Also we have uh the administrative administration department We also have the commercial department We have uh accountancy department and uh lastly uh we have the technical department\n<$B> uh So you are the head of infusions division and what is it all about\n<$A> Well the infusions division as such is concerned with the preparation of sterile products these being the intravenous fluids or in other words they are known as infusions These are solutions which are injected directly into a vein and therefore the solution is introduced directly into the blood stream uh The large whole of injections often called infusions or rather the intravenous  fluids they are frequently needed to replace body fluids lost from circulation as a result of shock or severe burns vomiting diarrhoea haemorrhage and other certain diseases\n<$B> uh Well uh I'm a bit swayed by the application of technical terms I can say uh but uh uh learning from what you have told us is that you're dealing with infusions \n<$A> yes\n<$B> uh and that means uh as you called them intravenous fluids uh would you take us to the process uh which necessitates the manufacturing of such fluids I mean the materials you use \n<$A>Wwell as I already said that these products are sterile products so in fact even uh the process of manufacturing these fluids they're a bit complicated\n<$B> \n<$A> We need uh qualified personnel who are really much committed to their work and uh the environment where we are working has to be very clean and to allow as minimum as possible the inclusion of other let's say bacteria or dust particles and so on \n<$B> uh and where do you get the raw materials\n<$A> Usually the raw materials are all imported with exception of water which is our main uh uh I mean the major quantity of the uh I mean the product itself is water Apart from that the rest of the raw materials are imported We get them from different countries from mostly from Netherlands uh from France from uh and some other few countries I can say\n<$B> You have just referred to uh clean working conditions and uh you said that uh that is generally meant for limiting bacteria uh Can you say how Can you tell us how uh such things like bacteria can be limited from uh from affecting your affecting the materials that you produce\n<$A> Well first of all we must have a minimum number of people working in that area \n<$B> \n<$A> You know the area must be very cleaned thoroughly cleaned throughout the working I mean throughout the working time so even the personnel themselves have to be very clean and the materials we are using the utensils we are using have to be very clean and usually the room which we use for the preparations I mean the atmosphere has been sterilised by using ultra-violet light which we switch on overnight so at least we find that the bacteria is minimised in those areas \n<$B> And uh would do you elaborate a bit on the sections in which uh the material passes before you get the final products\n<$A> Oh well we have uh three main sections in our production area We have the preparation section We have the clarity section and also the packing section The preparation section uh deals with distillation of water We have double distilled water This is uh also one of the main steps we are taking in ensuring that the product is uh uh at least sterile \n<$B> \n<$A> distillation of water I mean uh the water is being heated by steam \n<$B> \n<$A> and uh the condensed steam is then uh re-distilled so at least the water we are using is double distilled water and before using it we have to make sure that uh it is maintained at high temperatures not uh so as to avoid growth of bacteria it is not less than eighty degrees centigrade and uh before using this water for the preparation we have another department the quality control department which deals with ensuring that uh this RRR this water is fit for the preparation of some of our products and uh preparation section deals with the mixing of the products I mean all the ingredients together with the water Second we have the clarity section This is really concerned with uh clarity of the product because this solution has to be clear and colourless The third station is packing where the finished product after being filled into the bottles it has to be labelled well-labelled and packed So there are the three main sections we have in our division \n<$B> and what are the packaging materials You mean only bottles\n<$A> Well for the time being we used to have glass bottles but due to many disadvantages we have opted for using uh plastic bags They're of uh certain quality known as polypropylene so we use polypropylene bags \n<$B> And for somebody who is a layman like myself when you refer to such a term as What did you term it\n<$A> It's polypropylene the bags A certain material of plastic anyway which can resist high temperatures because before I mean after filling the solution to the bottles\n<$B> \n<$A> in order to ensure that this bottle is sterile it has to be sterilised so you have machines used for the sterilising of these products The bags are then subjected to very high temperatures and pressure so as to at least to kill all the bacteria which might have been introduced Now these plastic bags at least they can withstand that high temperature because the sterilising temperature is one and a half hours at two hundred and twenty centigrade so at least the material of these bags they can withstand such high temperatures \n<$B> And uh after packing has been performed what is the next destination of the product \n<$A> Well after being packed this product is being sent to the storage department where it is kept under quarantine because there are other tests which  have to be performed by the quality control department before this product is released for use So the quality control department has again to ensure that this product is sterile and fit for use So what it does is that it has to do some tests analysis to make sure that uh this product has got the active ingredient it is supposed to have and also to perform the sterility test to make sure that there are no bacteria inside So after these tests have been performed and they found that they qualify to the specifications then this product is then released for sale \n<$B> So you mean the quality control department is within the uh production division or how are they related in fact \n<$A> Well in fact two divisions they are related I mean the I mean the departments of production together with the quality control department They're two different departments but they're all related\n<$B> \n<$A> so wherever we produce this is starting from the raw materials the quality control department is concerned to make sure that this raw material is fit for the preparation of these pharmaceuticals and at the same time during the different stages of preparation the quality control department also has to ensure that uh this product has more than normal qualifications all the specified qualifications before we proceed to another step So so wherever the other areas let's say perhaps doing the weighing there must be some small areas maybe in the weight so the quality control department is concerned about the quantity or the percentage content of the ingredients we are using so at least it will notify us that either we have to add some more or else we'll have to add some more water or some more of the salt before filling of the product \n<$B> And <name/> head of the infusion divisions <name/> Pharmaceutical Industries uh limited uh you have uh told us uh more about uh how you produce the materials you call I mean the products you call infusions now uh one would also like to know uh what are the qualifications before one is considered to join your division for that matter \n<$A> Well uh as a pharmaceutical industry at least we would prefer that all who are working in this area or in this place have to have basic knowledge in pharmaceuticals The head of the division like myself I have to be have to beRRR a pharmacist \n<$B> by profession\n<$A> by profession So myself I'm a pharmacist and I'm <O/> pharmacist and uh there is also one pharmaceutical assistant who is at least working under me and in my absence he can head the division The main qualifications of other staff is that they have at least to have Form Four education uh preference with uh science subjects and uh these have to undergo some in-plant training of pharmaceutical production so these are usually called production assistants and uh where with these we have other production attendants who are usually concerned with the packing section so at least in the preparation section the staff has to be they all have to be production assistants with minimum qualifications of Form Four education\n<$B> And how does the production pattern look like I mean uh do you produce against customers' orders or uh you produce enough stocks for future orders or something like that\n<$A> Well we produce these according to the national demand but unfortunately we can't meet the demand cause of other small problems\n<$B> which are the problems\n<$A> Well the main problems we are facing in the division for the time being is uh sometimes that we have a need of raw materials \n<$B> \n<$A> Secondly the machines Of course all the machines are also imported so sometimes little frequent breakdowns of the machines we are stuck and we produce uh lower quantity of products than expected Thirdly we have other problems such as water cuts and electricity fluctuations which are very common here nowadays so that these are the main uh problems we are facing in the division \n<$B> Yeah how is generally the impact of the shortage of raw materials as a problem Is it affecting you so much to an extent that you find it quite painful I can say\n<$A> Really but uh fortunately for the last uh two years we haven't faced the problem of raw materials\n<$B> \n<$A> yeah but the main problem in the meantime is electricity fluctuations and uh the breakdown of the machines whereby we have to also import the spare parts some of them which may not be available here so <O/> we are forced to stop production but uh not quite I can say we haven't stopped I mean production completely unless there are there is no electricity but we have uh very competent personnel in the technical department\n<$B> \n<$A> who are usually doing their best so as uh not to allow the frequent machine breakdown to stop the production \n<$B> And what about water You mean you don't have a reserve tank \n<$A> We do have but sometimes we also use water for the production of steam I mean uh water is not enough We need plenty of water for the washing and also as a raw material for the production\n<$B> And how do you generally tackle the problem of electricity Maybe you have a generator machine something like that\n<$A> Well we haven't uh yet had a standby generator so these uh electricity cuts and electricity fluctuations they really do affect us a lot in the production We don't have any alternative but uh we now have another new unit whereby we have proposed to have a standby generator in case of these\n<$B> \n<$A> electricity fluctuations\n<$B> is a timely move\n<$A> yeah\n<$B> yeah and one wonders also how you go about uh delegating tasks to the staff under you How is the process\n<$A> Do you mean yes we have uh three as I've already said we have three different sections in the division\nS1BINT9T\n<$B> For the past year we've uh been working on uh our normal programme which includes counselling giving free clinical advice and uh social rehabilitation to victims of domestic and sexual violence But we've also been conducting our outreach programme where we whereby we visit schools we visit uh community centres religious organisations and so on to discuss the whole question of violence and what it entails and how the society can come together to fight it We've also been conducting workshops for police officers which is uh part of the of the initiative started by the former Minister for Home Affairs uh uh Honourable Mrema when he made a call to TAMWA to conduct police workshops for police officers on gender sensitisation to especially to help victims of domestic and sexual violence We've also opened sixteen new centres in and around Dar es Salaam which are at the moment quasi autonomous but we're hoping that in the future they'll be fully autonomous\n<$A> I'm interested to know more about uh the research that you conducted for the police force How did this come into uh inception\n<$B> Uh uh on the eighth of March uh this year in nineteen ninety-four the Minister the former Minister for Home Affairs uh Honourable Mrema visited the crisis centre as uh part of uh as part of the festival to mark the International Women's Day And when he visited the centre he made a donation of one million shillings and made a call to the centre in TAMWA to conduct workshops for police officers in Dar es Salaam as part of a gender sensitisation initiative so that police officers become sensitised on the issues of violence and uh against women and children and how they can help women and children when such incidents occur Therefore we conducted a series of ten workshops whereby thirty police officers from eleven centres police uh stations in uh Dar es Salaam that included men and women and uh the workshops uh included uh subjects like counselling para-legal skills uh gender sensitisation the whole issue of human rights and so on And at the end of uh three months we presented them with certificates and we are glad to say that we have kept in close contact with police officers because we feel that uh the centre uh the crisis centre that it has a very important role to play in society and so do police officers we believe that we have to work very closely together in order to eradicate violence against women and children\n<$A> And how do you feel the subjects or things were taken by the police force\n<$B> Uh well the first of all the whole concept of gender sensitisation was a bit uh strange for them in the sense that they were not aware of certain concepts for example of concepts of equality between men and women when it came to the home They it usually  happens in the offices where you can find a woman police officer who has a subordinate with a male but in the home they could not imagine that a man and a woman are equal and that a woman has equal rights and also in terms of human rights for the woman and children Women and children have uh the right to the whole notion of human rights So we introduced uh concepts of human rights to them in part as part of this gender sensitisation initiative After that we went full-scale into subjects like para-legal skills and counselling management and so on Initially we started with the whole notion of human rights\n<$A> Okay and I believe you also told me that you opened some branches of the crisis centre up you know in the suburbs of Dar es Salaam\n<$B> Yes we did We opened sixteen new centres uh in uh the three districts of Dar es Salaam But we also opened them we went beyond to Coast region We opened for example at <name/> at uh uh <name/> at uh <name/> at <name/> and so on And we also trained counsellors from those centres We trained about twenty-five counsellors from those centres so uh on skills like counselling and para-legal so that they know how to know how toRRR operate the centres\n<$A> How did you identify these areas\n<$B> We approached them through the <name/> offices and we asked them to identify women who have shown initiative in terms of campaigns and when we met with these leaders these women we talked with them we talked to them about the whole issue of violence and then some of them put uh came forward and came up with the idea that they would like to have centres in their own areas And uh we decided that they needed training So we trained them for three months and then went to open the centres\n<$A> Do you feel Leila after doing all this work the groups that you've trained so far really understand the whole concept of violence against women and gender sensitisation\n<$B> Yes they do because you see it's part of the training During the workshops we conduct skits which are very short uh dramas based on real life experiences We show skits of domestic violence We show skits of sexual violence whereby a woman is put in a situation uh where she is put in a situation as a victim and what happens when she is a victim So when they watch the skits sometimes they do take part in the skits themselves uh they can internalise the whole concept and it becomes even more realistic to them\n<$A> And uh what else did you do I mean for NGOs perhaps\n<$B> We trained about uh six other NGOs from different parts of the country from Mwanza from Mbeya Njombe from uh Tabora from uh Singida from Same on NGO management para-legal skills and counselling so that they can also open centres in their own areas\n<$A> Was this a request by them\n<$B> Yes it was a request by them because uh part of the initiative in the centre is to produce literature on uh our work in the centre as well as on concepts of violence what the law says about violence which we call them uh legal literacy They some of the groups got hold of the pamphlets and got hold of our address and they wrote to us and asked us if they could come and train with us In fact we trained about sixty people from the from the other NGOs and we trained about thirty police officers and we trained about twenty-five people from the new crisis centres the smaller ones So you find that we've been doing a lot of training this year which means to a large extent we've been sort of the centre has had a multiplying effect We have had new centres opening up and we hope that in the future many many more centres will be opened up throughout the country\n<$A> People might argue that uh perhaps TAMWA is expanding too much because now you are training people as far as Mbeya also How do you make follow-up for instance\n<$B> Well uh the groups in Mbeya are autonomous They have registered in their own They've their own constitutions They have their own uh uh framework of operations and so on But uh what we do is we give them skills that we learned the hard way See in TAMWA we didn't really have a blueprint with uh we had to learn by through trial and error And uh what we learned through trial and error we put down in the form of notes form of workshops participatory workshops we call them So what we do is we share our experiences with others And they learn from us but they also go to adapt what they learned from us to their own according to their own environment and situation And you find that it has a multiplying effect what they learned from us they go to the villages and they teach people there and the people in the villages go and teach others So you find that we have this very huge network A lot of them are autonomous and independent but we have a network in the sense that we are all closely emotionally connected and they write to us and we write to them Some of them got promoted and they wrote to me and said that they've got promotion Some of them became friends some of them uh contribute to <name/> magazine Some of them help to distribute our booklets our pamphlets and so on So we have a very big network\n<$A> What are some of the problems that you encountered in the course of training and conducting these workshops\n<$B> Uh I think the problems mainly have been in terms of concepts A lot of the concepts for example a lot of the notes that we've got from secondary sources were written in English So we had to translate them into Swahili in order for the village person people from the rural areas to understand Some of the concepts are really aren't uh you cannot translate them into Swahili that would be very apt So we had to do skits to explain some of the concepts for to them to for them to understand We had to sort of mime and do plays and skits But uh eventually they did understand For example the whole issue of violence in terms of gender sensitisation how do you transmit that into proper Swahili so that a person from the village would understand what gender sensitisation means And uh you can see uh things like that but uh later on we came up with our own jargon I think we ought to put it in the Swahili dictionary so that it can be accepted but people understood and uh a lot of the ideas came from the participants to the workshops\n<$A> And I mean you had these uh resounding successes you know conducting workshops and also getting letters afterwards that people had been promoted and also those wanting to get in touch with TAMWA Now how do you  envision/envisage you know the coming year What are you going to do\n<$B> Well uh we want to uh conduct the outreach programme nation-wide So far we've conducted the outreach programme in Dar es Salaam Coast region and uh Coast region Dar es Salaam in Morogoro Tabora Kilimanjaro and uh some parts of uh Tanga and Zanzibar But we want to conduct the outreach programme throughout the country What we want to do is we want to have an outreach team that would be based in Dar es Salaam that would train people from those areas to come Others the outreach team goes travels to that area and trains local teams because they'll be more adaptable they'll be more acceptable to their own people there they would know the area more train them on outreach techniques so that they can conduct the outreach programmes We also have plans to open hundreds of centres throughout the country but uh our constraints are funds and also in terms of linkages How do we link with these people because the people have to come forward to ask us to help them establish a centre We just can't go from Dar es Salaam and go to a strange area and say we want to open a centre We wouldn't be accepted in that area The idea has to come from the people themselves\n<$A> So far the crisis centre has used the approach of multi-disciplinary How do you hope to involve maybe the youth so that they can also be part and parcel of this and grow up you know with the concept of you know self-advancement in terms of uh violence against women\n<$B> We have a programme here which we're we areRRR going to start in January uh In fact the co-ordinator is not here It's <name/> She is co-ordinating a programme on the child labour It's called a programme on child labour And on this programme we're going to use the young people to talk to the young people What the what TAMWA will do is to provide training for the outreach team on outreach techniques pamphlet production and so on And then we're going to get the young people to go and talk to the young people about the rights of the child about uh human rights regarding the child about uh child labour about uh child uh abuse child defilement child sexuality about drug abuse and so on\nS1BINT10T\n<$A> This is Spotlight on Tanzania a programme that highlights some of the country's achievements This week our focus is on  the> Sadolin's Tanzania Limited a factory which manufactures paints Sadolin's Tanzania Limited is a paint making factory which is situated along Pugu Road not very far from the Tazara Mechanical Centre The firm which is privately owned has its headquarters in Copenhagen Denmark and receives the bulk of its technical aid from the Scandinavian countries Apart from manufacturing paints for various uses it also produces glue and other related products One aspect which attracted the producers of this programme when they visited the factory premises is the efforts being undertaken by the factory's management to resort to the use of local materials in the production process which amounts to sixty per cent This wisdom arises from the fact that the nation is currently plagued by lack of foreign exchange <ea/>Ndugu Adabo Moshi has served thirteen years with the company and knows a lot about the company's operations How did the Sadolin's Tanzania Limited come into being <ea/>Ndugu Moshi \n<$C> Uh Sadolin's paints started in nineteen uh sixty-three near uh <O_><O/> in the north and uh we  shifted from uh from that place it was a go-down we  shifted from there in nineteen sixty-eight we  started a new company Sadolin's \n<$B> How did it come up We are told that there are branches outside the country also Is there any connection between the those branches and this particular one \n<$C> Uh this company that is a branch from Nairobi it was in Nairobi and our *headquarter> it was Denmark and there is a branch in Kampala and a depot from Mwanza but they just uh can't get Mwanza they're now Sadolin's \n<$B> What types of paints uh does your factory produce \n<$C> Uh we produce water paints oil paints automotives uh <O/> paints emulsion paints We use a local raw material now because of shortage of foreign kinds we don't have so we decided to find another way of this \n<$B> What types of uh raw materials are used in the manufacture of paints \n<$C> We have uh different types Some of them we get them from abroad and a few of them we get here in Tanzania as a local material\n<$B> Which of those do you get from abroad and uh and which uh are locally produced \n<$C> Really we there is oil paints Oil paints you don't have here and uh some of the powders we get them from abroad of which here we can get them but we have uh few of the powders we can get here \n<$B> I'm told that uh you are also embarking on a programme of using raw materials because of the constraints of foreign exchange Uh could you tell us something on this programme\n<$C> Uh really we'd send our report getting the raw material quantity we need from the Bank of Tanzania but we didn't get Then we are now using some other companies which uh they need paints they just bring us uh the quantity of paints they want Then we can we write down uh a list of raw material we need for making that  paint and then they just send a letter to the Bank of Tanzania that's just to cover foreign currency then they bring the materials then we make the paint for you \n<$B> Apart from the raw materials you get from abroad <ea/>Ndugu Moshi I'm particularly interested uh in knowing what types of local materials you use in the manufacture of paints \n<$C> Uh here we use some of them we have only powders and uh there is our glue which we are getting them near and uh few of them but not as uh now we are using local material sixty per cent as the general manager told you \n<$B> What do you do say about the standards and quality of your paints you produce \n<$C> <ea/><O_><O/> in uh we have uh these oil paints There are three types of paints we have and uh water paints we have about uh four in number We have first quality second quality and third quality and fourth quality \n<$B> uh What would you say uh compared to international standards what is the standing of your paints you produce here\n<$C> <O/> our stand of producing paints if we get uh raw material we can make uh good quality If we don't have uh raw material so we just produce less From more local material we get from here in Tanzania we get powders like kaolin which we get from <O/> mining and uh we have these pigments we get them from Mwanza and and there is other things like glue we get them from uh <O/> Limited from Tanga uh and there are some <O/> for filling pens some of them we get from <name/> and some of them others we get from <name/>\n<$B> uh Does the quality of the paints change whether you use local or materials imported from outside \n<$C> Yes there are some changes because uh you see we make a test first when we receive the local materials here and then we compare with the imported raw materials Then we can put some percentages of uh local material and the imported raw materials so you can see that we have uh we use a little raw material from abroad and use a lot local raw material yes\n<$B> uh Would you briefly <ea/>Ndugu Moshi tell our listeners uh the production line this stage the first stage in the manufacture of paints \n<$C> uh The first the first stage of uh manufacturing paints first of all we take uh small containers Small containers that is the big containers and the small containers We put them in a scale That's the first thing and then after that we take a formula of all raw materials which needed to make a paint and then we weigh it  on a scale through their kilos written in the formula Then after that we send it to the mixer machine You stir it There is time of stirring them and then putting step by step Then you end up the paints \n<$B> How are your training programmes as the uh training officer of Sadolin's uh factory \n<$C> Well you see there is those illiterate people they don't know how to to read and then but after training them they know how to write and read and some of them uh they know how to talk English because some of our raw materials are written in English so they have to know how to read English and uh I've sent some of the people here too from abroad one of them but he's not here He has already resigned and uh one from Nairobi and uh we are training others people from <O/> to go to some other places like <ea/><O_><O/> for practice uh and there are others we send them from metal engineering from <name/> you know <name/> for training on maintenance on machines and uh I think it does\n<$A> That was <ea/>Ndugu Moshi who apart from being the factory's supervisor is the training officer Juhata branch chairman and raw materials' controller <ea/>Ndugu Resa Ganji is the assistant production manager who is a chemical engineer by profession Although he has been with the company for a very short spell he was able to furnish us with the factory's details Here is <ea/>Ndugu Ganjii narrating the whole procedure of producing paints \n<$D> Well we have basically two kinds of paint here uh We make emulsion paint which is water-based and uh we make oil paint which is oil-based or alkyd resin-based I'll talk a little bit on the emulsion paint first which is water-based Basically the water paint consists of uh the emulsion which is water and a glue and the pigments which give us the colour finally Uh first uh this process as such is a physical process We start by adding all the powders mostly the pigments and the extenders plus the glue in a vat which is a sort of a drum a pre-measured drum All these ingredients are weighed and then put inside the drum mixed with water That's basically our process The formulation indicating the quantities of which ingredient is already tailor-made and uh it is conceived in Denmark Sadolin's uh headquarters there in the main lab So what we basically do we got to just take the formulation read the formula which is already made and do the mixing of the paint here The same thing applies uh with the oil paint It's just that the ingredients are different There in the oil paint we don't use water we use mostly the the resins but the pigments are just the same After the mixing of the paint the paint is subjected to some tests which are again prescribed by the Sadolin's headquarters in Denmark uh We carry  out tests uh for such as viscosity tests uh density specific gravity drying time and opacity \n<$B> And how is the colour of the paints determined \n<$D> uh The colour of the paints we have an equipment called a colour-meter which measures the colour of the paint The colour of the paint of course is imparted by pigments various pigments and uh mixing of various pigments as well \n<$B> <ea/>Ndugu Resa Ganji as the assistant production manager of Sadolin's uh factory uh apart from the uh manufacture of paints what also does the factory engage in \n<$D> Well uh apart uh from manufacturing paints we manufacture spot putty I mean putties We manufacture varnishes as well and uh I think that's it now \n<$B> And  what is the structure of the Sadolin's Tanzania Limited \n<$D> Well uh we have the managing director followed by the general manager and the factory manager who's in charge of the factory area The factory manager of course is assisted by me and uh a mechanical engineer who looks after the machines you know\n<$B> Uh what is the factory's production capacity \n<$D> The factory's uh capacity is about uh twenty thousand litres per annum That's combined output including oil and emulsion paint But at the moment because of the constraints in foreign exchange which have resulted in uh lack of raw material we are doing about uh  eighteen thousand litres \n<$B> uh In fact <ea/>Ndugu Moshi just mentioned the constraint of foreign exchange In fact I wanted to know  to what extent would you say uh lack of foreign exchanges affected your operations and what are you doing about that \n<$D> Well uh the lack of foreign exchange has affected our operation as it has in many industries Our capacity now is almost sixty per cent but uh we are trying to uh make efforts to find a local substitute of raw material which will fit into our formulations and in this field I can say that we have made some progress We have uh for instance in our emulsion paint the pigments consumed  are for about sixty per cent locally available uh and right now we are experimenting on some other pigments which are also locally available \n<$B> uh Does the fact that you are now getting uh in local raw materials uh does it change the quality of your paints in any way\n<$D> uh No so far our quality has remained consistent despite the fact that we are substituting local raw material Of course uh when we are substituting we are going very cautiously and uh making a lot of research before we conclude any product but so far we have had no problems with our product \n<$A> <ea/>Ndugu Resa Ganji Despite the elaborate plans of the company's training programme some workers are yet to learn to speak English the so-called language of civilisation But that is not a handicap because they know their work Here is one of them <ea/>Ndugu <name/> who mixes the raw materials for paints production in its early stages What does he do\n<$E> My duties include mixing paints after carefully following the formula by paint experts in the first stage of production After that I work on these containers of six hundred litres and nine hundred litres I apply the code numbers like water which has a  professional number I measure the requirements and work on them After that the experts come to assist and to check my work When I'm through I send it to my next colleague who passes it to the mixing machine \n<$A> And the following sound tells you how the actual mixing is undertaken \n<$A> From there the next stage in the production line is the tinting section where the colour of the paints is determined\nS1BINT11T\n<$A> We present Women's Half-Hour\nWelcome once again to another edition of Women's Half-Hour Today we bring you an interview with Professor Anna Tbeijuka about the National Women Council BAWATA Stay tuned\n<$A> The National Women Council BAWATA which was registered recently was established in July nineteen ninety-four but it is a known fact that majority of women in this country still do not know the aims and objectives of the council Professor Anna Tbeijuka interim chairperson of the council elaborates\n<$B> Well the objectives of the uh National Women's Council or BAWATA is to unite all women you know in their struggle for equality The idea here there are many women groups there are many women individuals who are concerned you know  about the unequal position of women in society So the council is here to act as an umbrella organisation and provide a united forum where women can meet and discuss their position and lay out strategies on how to proceed \n<$A> The council is still new to most of us Now can you please tell us the organisation's structure and the membership procedures \n<$B> Well uh BAWATA was formed actually in July last year by National Women's Conference which was held at the University of Dar es Salaam where about four hundred women met Every region was presented by about seven representatives The idea was to capture a broad spectrum of women interest groups uh you know there were for example women from the ruling party women from the opposition women from uh the Islamic community women from the Christian community women from economic NGOs They all assembled in Kuruma last year at the Kuruma Hall University of Dar es Salaam and unanimously decided to form this umbrella organisation which is called BAWATA you know So it is a new it is newly registered but it has been operative now for the last nine months Uh it is true that it is a as a new organisation many people have not heard about it but actually its origin is that it has members founder members are found all over Tanzania In all regions of Tanzania BAWATA has founder members So it is an idea which will spread very very quickly throughout the  country \n<$A> Now can you tell us the membership procedures in case one wants to join  with> the council \n<$B> Yes the organisational structure of BAWATA actually starts from the grassroots It's a grassroots organisation It has a structure which we can call which is vertical in the sense that you have village to the district to the region and then to the national level but then it is also horizontal It is horizontal structure in the sense that women can join as individuals or they can join as groups so for example if you have a group of women who are interested in raising chicken in a village and others who are maybe sewing who are sewing who are doing handicraft they can also their groups can also join BAWATA So you have what you call a horizontal co-ordination of women activities at village level or at district level at national level and then you have a vertical structure so that you have a democratic representation So it is a democratic institution in the sense that you reach the grassroots so that the national leaders have contact with the grassroots Horizontal that women can talk with each other even if they have different interests It is a non-partisan women's organisation in the sense that it does not does notRRR discriminate anybody Women from different political parties can join In fact the women's sections in political parties can join UWT for example can join BAWATA if they like The women members in CHADEMA can join BAWATA if they like Their section can join BAWATA so it does not discriminate Women lawyers can join Professional women groups can join BAWATA So the procedures then for joining will be that when the branches are established in uh districts and in regions and then finally in the villages uh women will just apply for membership The membership fee is only two hundred fifty shillings It is the that is a minimum and the idea is to make it to keep the fee accessible to most of the women so the fee that it must be something that the majority of women can afford So you apply for membership and if twenty-five people in a village are necessary and fifteen people at a place of work like Radio Tanzania You need fifteen women to open your branch but if you are not are notRRR enough you can invite your neighbours you know surrounding offices can also join your group and you can open your branch So the procedure for membership is very simple Registration forms will be spread and women can just you know twenty-five or fifteen women gather up and form a branch It is as simple as that \n<$A> But uh from my experience sometimes it is really impossible to change somebody to something which she has used to do Now what methods are you going to use to convince these women to join with the council\n<$B> Yes well I should explain very clearly here that uh actually BAWATA is an umbrella organisation so women don't have to give up anything to join BAWATA They just add BAWATA onto the list of activities they are doing So as an umbrella organisation you can still keep your membership in TAMWA for example in your case You would still remain a member of TAMWA In fact that is the Tanzania Media Women's Association for example I am assuming that you are a member of that association So that you don't have to give up that association to become a member of BAWATA You just join BAWATA and uh in fact even that association can join BAWATA because if that association for example wants to send a representative to the National Congress then they have to join BAWATA and I would like to believe that the women's association a professional women's association like TAMWA would like to be in the national congress then they would join BAWATA So you don't this is something that you just become richer you add something onto yourself You don't lose anything else I think it is really selling itself but all the same we are going to spend a lot of time on education you know informing the people what this organisation is all about making clarifications We have to clarify things which I was saying it's a new thing so you have to clarify \n<$A> So if the UWT member can join BAWATA the Chedema woman can join BAWATA the <name/> girls can join BAWATA Now are you not afraid that the CCM woman can bring CCM ideas or the Chedema woman can bring the Chedema ideas Are you not afraid that uh chaos might happen or might erupt on the way \n<$B> Actually uh the idea of a non-partisan women's organisation of course people will still remain with their ideas but you see people join BAWATA well because of the importance of meeting as women to discuss our problems the common line the *commonalty> that as women we are discriminated So for example women from different political parties will join BAWATA because they would like to have a forum where they can breathe in space leave back party positions ideology and things like that and just talk as women you know So definitely those who are not yet enlightened will be enlightened that this is a forum which is non-partisan where everybody is equal and where everybody is valued And women are not a homogeneous group For sure they have different views They see things differently but we are united in the to fight the discrimination against us That is the whole point so that we do not really foresee with the proper education we we'll not foresee any problems because our members will be enlightened that we are meeting here that the whole purpose of joining BAWATA you know is to leave behind you know party positions and party heckling and you know fan being a fan you know being excessive You are coming in a forum where you can keep cool and discuss the problems of women and the strategies to solve such problems \n<$A> Professor Tbeijuka you can talk at length about the council but uh so long as they are not going to benefit anything from the council they won't be able to join with uh BAWATA Now can you tell us what is the difference between the council and the other women organisations such as UWT \n<$B> Well you see the UWT is a women section in a political party and I think the political parties are also establishing you know their women wings So I think CHADEMA is also trying to establish its own and <name/> is trying to establish its own etcetera etcetera etcetera and the UWT of course is a quite a big organisation It has been here for quite some time and uh during in the old system they were you know they were a machinery you know for a voice for all the women Now they're a voice for all CCM women BAWATA is bringing all those voices under one house under one umbrella as I say hence the name of an umbrella organisation The difference uh between the First of all I should clarify that there is no competition between BAWATA and UWT It is honorary collaboration uh UWT and many other similarly placed women sections in political parties these are women who are aspiring for political leadership They are a member of a political party It's because a political party by definition is a group of people who want to get the powers of the state to govern BAWATA is a civic organisation It is not seeking governance per se but it is seeking good governance So BAWATA is an is a civic society what we call civic society uh BAWATA is not uh is promoting women but this under our constitution now this can only be done within political parties so for example BAWATA we are encouraging women to come up and contest the next election They cannot do it under BAWATA for the constitution that we have This they have to do within political parties so BAWATA is very easy busy trying to encourage women in CCM in CHADEMA in UTP <name/> etcetera etcetera please go forward make sure that your parties propose you for a candidate you see So BAWATA is a civic society organisation It is not seeking to get state power but UWT is a group of women leaders women who are aspiring for political leadership while the BAWATA women want good governance I think you can see the difference there \n<$A> Yes BAWATA was established only last year but I'm sure you have been doing something to promote women's development What are the current activities of the council \n<$B> Yes uh since we started uh the women who founded BAWATA this was at the Kuruma Hall University of Dar es Salaam they decided that four issues were very important The first issue was a question of land rights for women land rights for women and BAWATA has followed up this issue very closely uh We asked uh some uh experts at the University of Dar es Salaam and I was myself able to participate in that capacity as a professional woman We were able for example to present a paper at the National Land Conference which was held in Arusha and Minister Luasa was kind enough to you know give us an audience in that conference and our argument was that women should get full land rights that time has come for women to get full land rights Another issue emphasised by the founder members and I think by many many women in Tanzania was the question of inheritance rights As you know many women many widows are really being you know being dispossessed by the relatives of their diseased husbands This situation now is increasing as the traditional uh uh kinship networks traditional customs break down\nS1BINT12T\n<$A> Please welcome to another half-hour of the programme Be My Guest Our guest today is Professor Leonard Shayo from the University of Dar es Salaam Leonard Shayo is a mathematics professor and also a project leader of the International village of Science and Technology based in Arusha Professor Shayo is with us now here in the studio and he chats with my colleague Sekunje Kitoye \n<$C> Professor Shayo my first question is uh how did you bring yourself where you are\n<$B> Thank you Mr Kitoye uh I only started my primary education in nineteen fifty-four at a grammar school known as <name/> middle school No I started at a national native authority primary school and then I joined the <name/> middle school in middle school nineteen sixty-two Let me say that the schools in those days the middle schools of those days were really like the secondary schools of today in the sense that uh the education was of a very high quality and really we had only one thing in mind just to pursue education with all our might So we managed to pass the class eight examination and then I went to <name/> Secondary School where I stayed until nineteen eighty-six nineteen sixty-six sorry And then I went to <name/> School where I started I studied pure maths applied maths and physics uh Those <O/> combinations were there Today they are not there And let me again say that again we had only one thing in mind and that is just to pursue knowledge uh After that uh when I reached form six in nineteen uh uh in nineteen sixty-eight after filling the forms to choose our career I selected to become a mechanical engineer that is to go to Nairobi because I thought being an engineer is a good thing But uh maybe by that we were visited by a professor from the university of Dar es Salaam Professor <name/> He was a professor of mathematics by then and he gave us a lecture in mathematics and I was very much impressed to see how elegant he was and how he made he madeRRR his nice presentation So immediately I went to my headmaster and told him that I would like to join the university of Dar es Salaam and pursue education But I was made to go to my headmaster after asking that professor how can one become like you And he simply advised me that if you want to become like me uh select to go to the university of Dar es Salaam and take mathematics and education that is enter into becoming a teacher and that's what I did And uh after doing my examinations then I joined the university of Dar in nineteen sixty-nine But because my aim was to become like this professor I had to study very hard when I was at the university because I knew that if I did not perform well then I would have been I would have gone to teach in the schools which I really My aim was to become like professor <name/> So that's uh why I studied very hard and after finishing my first degree I got my first class and immediately I was given a scholarship to go to Britain University of London Again I knew my ambition was to become like professor <name/> so I knew I must get my PhD and after that I got my PhD nineteen seventy-seven at <name/> University and of course since then I've been working hard and there you have to work hard and publish to get promoted and so on\n<$C> uh Exactly what do you do as a professor there at the University of Dar es Salaam\n<$B> Of course there we uh the main responsibility there is to teach mathematics and also do research in mathematics But at present really and maybe since nineteen eighty eighty-seven I've been very busy in promoting this uh the International village for science and technology which I started then after spending my sabbatical leave at the International Centre for Theoretical Theses for two years That's nineteen eighty-five to eighty-seven And since eighty-seven then I've been very busy with this village So I must say that of course I do the teaching and also promoting this village whose objective is to bring about the scientific and technological revolution in Tanzania in particular and Africa in general.\n<$C> You have been talking of the International Village for Science and Technology in Tanzania and uh my next question is about that uh which is uh The village is at Arusha What is this village all about\n<$B> Well let me say that the concept of the village is at Arusha because really we have just started conceptualizing this village uh We have not really built the village as such The village is more now it's more in terms of projects and programmes We realize that it really takes a long time to build a whole village So we have started to run programmes After all really the village eventually has to be uh a set of programmes and projects because even if we build the buildings the buildings by themselves will not  construct the village So after we realised that it will take us a long time to get the land to build the village and the buildings to I mean to be constructed So we have realised the village now in terms of just running the programmes which can be run without buildings At Arusha we have a small office which is the international conference centre which coordinates the programmes with the village Myself I'm at the University of Dar es Salaam I continue teaching at the university while at the same time coordinating the activities of this village We hope that after we get the land which we are looking for which is about twenty-five square kilometres of land we shall forest this land and then maybe construct an international primary school for the talented kids and then we go on constructing other structures in a priority basis\n<$C> And about this Village of Science and Technology many people don't understand uh science and technology I mean these two words and what is the difference between uh these two words science and technology Can you elaborate on that \n<$B> Yah I think very briefly that science is the theory behind technology uh Technology has you know is realized from implementing the theories of science For example uh a simple example is the theory behind the water engine is science but uh the realization of that theory into uh an engine which works is technology So technology is the is what happens after you transform theories into practical gadgets uh The theory for example the uh if you discuss for example a disease like malaria uh the technology uh the medicine that is made to cure malaria is whatever it is it's technology But the theory behind that medicine is science.\n<$C> Uhu There is a question of food importation in our country and uh there are some problems in importing these foods from outside the country which some foods are have expired Now Professor Leonard Shayo why don't we use the technology and science because we have the experts to make our own food or can our own foods here in Tanzania \n<$B> Well let me say that that question really it's complicated in the following sense that the technology of food production is when technology there is really very little to be discovered Of course our scientists are being sent here and there but if really the issue is just to produce food well almost all the technology we need here is available It's available and what is maybe surprising is why don't we use this technology And in fact really one can discern some maybe bad motives in all this exercise Why should a country like Why should our countries I mean African countries but <O/> in particular we have all the resources to produce all the food we need The rivers flow all the year taking water to the sea and if you go back in history you'll find that in almost all countries where there are rivers civilisation started in those rivers The people in Egypt for example depend on the River Nile to irrigate the agriculture so one question uh which really is not a question to be directed to a professor like myself is a question that should be directed to the businessmen and the people's firms Why don't they use that the money they have to open big firms and produce the food in Tanzania rather than import the food from outside I mean that's a question that can be asked to people with firms and those people who are importing food uh into the country in the name of business Why can't the same business people invest in the in producing food in Tanzania when we know we have plenty of land we have so many rivers we could use to irrigate <-./>irrigat agriculture Why are they not doing that So that's a question that maybe I would say maybe in terms of the radio why don't you call them here and ask them why are they preferring to import food from outside rather than producing the food here in Tanzania or in Africa For one thing it is not profitable to produce food You know if you're investing in producing food you'll get more money than if you import the food and the proof is very simple Why are those farmers in America producing food and exporting to us It's because it's more profitable Otherwise they could have imported the food from us So they produce the food and sell to us because it's more profitable And with that argument why aren't our businessmen investing in food production and make more money if the aim is to make more money So personally if you ask me I'll say any move to import food into the country is more directed to us by very bad motive I'll maybe uh make one exception When there is a drought serious drought which you see then one can say let's import food from outside to save people from death but that's the only exception You see if you look at many of our countries the trees are green the grass is green meaning it rained If for example you tell somebody there's drought in this country the answer is you don't know what a drought is and if you want to know what a drought is you should go to Israel go to the deserts of the Sahara then you'll know what a drought is So my impression is that although we say there's a drought in this country what we should say is there's drought in parts of the country but not in the whole country You travel from here to Dodoma it's all green on both sides of the road and there's no food growing maybe grass and trees You travel from here to Arusha it's almost all green The whole of the <name/> region is green and yet there is no food and people are importing food So my challenge to you people on the radio call the businessmen ask them why do they import food into the country rather than investing in the rich land we have along the river valleys in this country and produce food for this country and make more money That question they should answer \n<$C> Professor Leonard Shayo maybe don't you think it's uh because of the policies of the government that it doesn't give room to these businessmen or men who want to invest in the country to I mean to acquire big land so that they can farm.\n<$B> I don't think I would say it is a policy of the government as such because I don't think there is anybody who has wanted land in this country to produce food and he's been denied that land Unless this person goes to land which is already occupied by some peasants Of course that's not acceptable because the very good land that can be producing without much energy can be left to the peasants \nS1BINT13T\nfor those who are just listening this week facing the microphone is the chairperson of the Mathematical Association of Tanzania Dr <name/> Massanga Dr Massanga you have said that MAT or Mathematical Association of Tanzania is a non-governmental organisation NGO and such organisations they do have some relationship with other non-organisations outside the country so far Has MAT involved in any of the international organisations the non-governmental organisations this year What is the organisation\n<$B> uh uh MAT  has got uh correspondences with similar organisations in other countries We subscribe our bulletin to some similar organisations in Britain in uh USA and recently we are trying to have a link uh with some uh mathematical association in Italy and uh there is some correspondence with uh Namibia\n<$A>And how does MAT meet its objectives\n<$B> uh for the first twenty-five years MAT has been striving to improve the average rating levels and standards of performance in the subject through various activities For instance uh in order to develop to share and to disseminate the original knowledge in the subject MAT publishes a bulletin The bulletin is called the Tanzanian Mathematical Bulletin and two uh issues come out annually This is for members Then there is a junior bulletin for students which is published uh once a year So far over forty-two volumes of the bulletin and over ten issues of the junior bulletin have been published Next for improving the quality of existing teachers and keeping them abreast of the subject matter and uh informing them of the latest development in the subject and in the maths education MAT conducts seminars and in-service training MAT has organised over twenty-four seminars at national level over fifteen seminars at grammar level and over seven in-service courses Thirdly in order to develop and stimulate interest of mathematics in students as well as to sharpen special ability and skills among gifted students in the subject MAT awards prizes to best-performing students in the National Examinations at Ordinary and A level It organises contests at national level and awards prizes It organises and sends students to international competitions MAT forms math clubs in schools and organises inter-school math fairs and exhibitions and uh also it organises research competitions\n<$A> Dr <name/> Massanga you have also mentioned of the twenty-five years since the inception of the MAT or Mathematical Association of Tanzania And it is believed too that you are on your way that may be not very far that you will be celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary. Could you just give us a hint as to what will be done during the celebrations\n<$B> During the forthcoming celebrations uh we are going to hold uh exhibitions uh students' exhibitions on mathematical objects uh as well as games and puzzles We are going to the book display of mathematics books published by MAT and MAT institutions and others We are going to have a display of posters on the history of mathematics and the history of MAT Then we are going to have our usual annual seminar In that seminar we are going to have uh lectures on different topics we are going to have a panel discussion on uh research uh mathematical research going on in the country We are going to have uh guest speakers who are going to talk about the educational systems in other countries and current trends and we are going to have a lecture of the year which is usually a topic that has not very much to do with mathematics And uh we are going to hold our annual general meeting in during which we are going to deliberate on problems facing the teaching and learning process in mathematics and uh we are going to come out with resolutions and recommendations which we usually send to policy makers policy implementors and uh the others who are concerned in the teaching process\n<$A> Well before I take you to the problems or setbacks that are pressing the association Dr Massanga maybe I should ask you something on the celebrations I would like to know as to where and when are you going to have your celebrations and who will be the guest of honour\n<$B> Our celebrations are going to take place at the Klerruu Teachers College in Iringa And this the opening ceremony will be on the sixteenth September nineteen ninety-one That is next Monday and uh in the afternoon we'll continue with a seminar which will end on the twenty-first of September nineteen ninety-one We are not yet sure about the guest of honour\n<$A> And now back to the problems and setbacks Mathematical Association of Tanzania being a non-governmental organisation I'm sure it has its successes but before we reach to success may you please give us a hint on what are the problems or setbacks that MAT is facing\n<$B> As usual many subjects are facing problems of textbooks problems of inadequate teachers and so on and so forth Mathematics is hard-hit because it is not easy to retain mathematics teachers in the teaching profession And uh to be able to tackle the problem of uh lack of requisite educational materials such as uh textbooks as well as uh teaching material MAT has been trying to produce a teaching aid and MAT has been trying to publish some books and teaching materials Well to so that one needs finance uh Some zones have tried to raise funds through charity work and other activities and by so doing they could acquire teaching materials and uh make teaching material using locally available material But this is very inadequate To publish books people have tried to write manuscripts but they face the problem of having these manuscripts published Again the standard of teachers themselves is not adequate To do to be able to raise it one has to organise in-service training courses Now these have been organised on ad-hoc-basis because the finances were not there So when we get a little bit of  finance from some donors we do that So our major setback has been lack of funds and the budget allocations to the ministries to whom we run for  finance has been getting tighter and tighter and this has caused a decline in the amount of resources we could get from them\n<$A> Dr Massanga you being the chairperson of the Mathematical Association of Tanzania we understand that the problem when is known and a solution is found then you get successes But before you reach to successes may you first just tell us have you ever received any assistance from some of the outside non-governmental organisations like MAT and especially on the problems that you have mentioned or the setbacks that you have mentioned because the biggest you have mentioned is the finance Is there any international non-governmental organisation that has given you any assistance financially\n<$B> uh in the past we used to get uh very little funds from various donors like the International Centre for Theoretical Physics and uh UNESCO and the others to finance our our annual seminars But this was very little indeed But recently we have entered a contract with the Harold Macmillan trust of London and uh this is for a three-year project This project is for publication of our teaching material that is book for secondary education as well as uh bulletins and news letters Also it is for in-service training which is to be spread throughout the different zones The project is half funded by the European Community We are still looking for the other half\n<$A> Thank you very much Now to the successes I understand that having problems and having solutions of solving these uh problems then come successes I wonder whether the Mathematical Association of Tanzania has ever met with any successes so far in the in its twenty-five years of its existence\n<$B> Well it is not easy to measure the success particularly where uh the number of mathematics students is increasing much more rapidly than the number of the teachers Even the number of the increased teachers is not retained in the teaching But we feel without the efforts of MAT I think the situation would have been worse because the seminars we organise annually attract a lot of the teachers and teachers gain a lot from them because they are some kind of an in-service training The bulletins we produce are reading material to the students to the teachers The junior  bulletins also are reading materials to the students The well we talked about the bulletin and uh the contest we organise the prizes we award these competitions and all that They stimulate interest in the students And uh I feel that MAT has done quite a lot towards uh sustaining the subject and they're trying to interest more students  in the subject\n<$A> Dr <name/> Massanga before we end this programme uh I have something uh in person and that is about yourself You being the national chairperson of the Mathematical Association of Tanzania maybe some of the members who do not know uh you well would like at least to know your historical background We have just told them that you are the senior lecturer at the Mathematics Department at the University of Dar es Salaam But people may like to know more about you May you now give us a hint as to where did you study and what did you take while you were in your university or any other uh institution\n<$B> Yes well I did my primary education in Mwanza and then my secondary education <name/> Secondary School and then <name/> College which was there later <name/> Secondary School Then I did my A levels at <name/> Secondary School I finished my <O/> nineteen seventy-two and started my Standard One in nineteen sixty-six Then I joined the University of Dar es Salaam in seventy-three after coming from <O/> National Service And there I took uh mathematics physics statistics first year Second year I majored in maths and uh physics Then I immediately after my completion I joined the Mathematics Department as a tutorial assistant That was in July uh April nineteen seventy-six And in nineteen eighty I left for West where I did a language course and uh of German and then joined the Technical University of uh Berlin And I did my PhD in free dynamics at the Technical University of Berlin Then I returned home and continued teaching <O/> in mathematics\n<$A> Dr <name/> Massanga thank you very much for that uh brief historical background of yours But now maybe again another personal question And this one is on the problems your personal problems in lecturing and especially lecturing in mathematics A lot of people uh very fear that maybe for a woman to take such a field as a lecturer in mathematics uh some of us may think that women always are having a lot of things to do How do you combine your personal or private work and these well the job of lecturing at the mathematics department in the University of Dar es Salaam\n<$B> Well uh what I can tell you is that uh when I joined the university my whole first year academic year I was pregnant And uh I combined that with my studies and I got my baby and uh the second year was tougher because I was breast-feeding and I had to go to the university and come home uh downtown to look after the child And I got my son uh just when I registered for my Master That was my second child My third child I did my PhD exam today and the following day I was admitted for delivery in hospital So uh what I want to say is that I got three children while I was doing my three degrees uh it was not uh as easy as one could think of but I feel one can combine the two ideals and I succeeded My major problem actually is not uh all the maternal and marital responsibility which I have uh My major problem is all the prejudice The prejudice which is there that you're a woman it's not easy for you to do mathematics you have to prove beyond \n<$A> doubt\n<$B> doubt that you can do mathematics This problem I felt it a lot more when I was in  Germany because I had to look for a supervisor and I went around and it was not easy to get one\nS1BINT14T\nYou and the Environment This is another edition of You and the Environment Today we bring you an interview with <ea/>Ndugu Ave Maria <name/> assistant lecturer with the Muhimbili College of Health Sciences about a research on gender and environmental management\n<$A> A research on gender and environmental management is crucial in case the government intends to bring development among the people in this society That kind of a research was therefore conducted in Shinyanga rural district between nineteen ninety and nineteen ninety-two Ave Maria <name/> was one of the members who participated in the research In this interview with Radio Tanzania's Tenzi <name/> Ave Maria talks among other things the objectives and what has been discovered out of the research\n<$B> uh The major objectives of the research was first to produce a gender profile on issues concerning women such as socio-economic and cultural and traditional elements of the area And secondly was to <O/> of energy supply and use of water energy supply and useand water supply Thirdly it was traditional management and control strategies of the natural resources uh Fourth it was to look at the constraints for women participation in the management and control of the environment or land such as land water forest etcetera And fifthly it was to propose action plan for women in Shinyanga Soil Conservation and Aforestation Project which is SHISCAP \n<$C> We hope with Ave Maria such a research might be useful in future in case the possible solutions are found to bring about change in the society Now what major environmental problems have you discovered still affecting people in Shinyanga\n<$B> Uh to be sincere because we went there for a special task so the first thing which we discovered in Shinyanga this was during our pilot study in nineteen ninety First of all we found that at least the problems which were announced there uh The staff were just left to know they're just they're foresters They are technical people foresters and nobody cared about giving them the human element how to go about dealing with uh people you know So it was really difficult for them to communicate the message to the people so that it was the first issue which we discovered Secondly it was uh this problem of socio-cultural boundaries you understand because the Sokumas are very closed society So in order to penetrate them uh you really need to be among them This thing was really difficult for project people in Shinyanga because first they lack transport to go there and also some uh incentives to make them go and spend more time in the villages So it was again another constraint towards achievement of these programmes Thirdly we found that uh most of these projects were top down We found that people just sit somewhere and they think that these people they have this problem now how are we going to solve them You just send them uh sent people to introduce maybe central conservation without prior consultation with the people So you find that people participation was lacking Uh and uh fourthly you find that women were not involved in planning of this project while at the end they were supposed to be implementers and this in most cases was due to the fact that the Sokuma culture is you know it's biased against women women are not supposed to appear in the public So whenever there is something to discuss and decide it is always men who  do so So that was another constraint And uh fifthly when we went there we found that there were too many uh institutions and projects which were dealing with uh the same issue of environment but there was no coordination between them So we found that this is a problem because you find that today it is Hashi going there tomorrow it is uh World Vision International So it was like competing on the same person So instead of helping it was like you know sabotaging each other's work which we didn't see as a healthy situation So we're seeking maybe a coordinating body to be installed in the area And sixthly it was that those conserved  areas lacked protection because we went there Hashi was spending a lot of time and uh council district council spent a lot of time and resources to establish these central conservation conserved areas but you find that after they regenerate people now start sending their cattle there and you find that personnel you find in every division I think there was only one personnel who is not enough to ensure the security of these uh uh reserved uh plots So for us that was a constraint but also for this uh we can link it with the people's participation because if they were really involved in the whole process they were supposed to be the uh security to provide the security for these  areas So those are the main constraints which we discovered and which took us to the main study now which took us uh two years to complete\n<$C> Apart from the constraints you mentioned I'm sure talking to the respondents they might probably uh mention certain measures they take to conserve the environment or to control environmental problems What are they\n<$B> Uh there are some individuals who you know when we are talking about these problems but uh they were not universal They are people who really benefited from these programmes especially from uh uh Roman Catholic Mission from Hashi and from district council You find some individuals who have started uh central conservation within their plots They are those who have uh decided to start agro-forestry on their personal plots and you'll find some who have decided to prepare these controls and what-not in the process of just trying to conserve the land from erosion And there are also some institution which decided to pick up from Hashi and started to mobilize again the people at the societal level And here I would like to cite an example of Mipa Catholic Mission in Mondo Division Uh this church there are two padres there who are Sokumas but not from that area but after seeing that problem they decided to mobilize these people and for them first they used uh these used clothes <ea/>mitumba So after some time that thing became internalized in them and uh in fact it is a very successful project which is co-owned or co-managed by the church and the village government Uh out of that conserved area the villages managed to purchase uh a milling machine from the village for that solving another problem which we are facing uh the people there because they didn't have a milling machine before and now they are trying to solve water problem by creating a dam because they have a season uh river which passes through their village but unfortunately it is dry during the dry season So they were mobilizing the mission was trying to mobilize some funds because it is very expensive to build a dam to get some external sources of funding so that they can establish that uh dam So so far you find that there are some  institutions which have decided to take up these issues from these technical people and some individuals also who have decided again to solve this environmental problem on the family level So this is what we discovered \n<$C> These are your personal efforts Ave Maria but I would now like to know what are your recommendation as far as environmental problems are concerned\n<$B> Uh what we recommended even for that very SHISCAP project first of all we said people's participation was very crucial Uh we said first those people who were involved in those projects should go and see traditionally how these people were managing their environment because when we were there people were talking about some other methodology whereby they used to conserve the land to conserve the soil So I think it was unfair for somebody just to come and say you have to introduce a central conservation you have to plant maybe lucina or what So you said maybe go back to the people discuss with them about their  methods and then try to improve on them That was first Secondly it is the type of trees to be planted Many people there were reserved in fact about the type of trees which were provided by these environmentalists For them they would prefer traditional trees which uh commonly and have wider use So for them this lucina was really very not very uh good for them but uh they wanted eucalyptus and what these trees which can produce maybe timber uh which can provide fodder for their animals something like that but I don't know what was their reservation about lucina but they were really against lucina Uh another thing which we proposed again is that uh for water sources maybe it is better to go back again and reintroduce the melanpo because it is very difficult to separate Sokuma from uh his or her <O/> So always when we were talking about Sokuma we are talking about him her and her <O/> So to us for us we propose that maybe the melanpo system be reintroduced in the village so that they can manage to participate because up to now you find that during the dry season young men migrate with the cattle southwards to go and look for pasture there while here now are left back women and old people So this is really another problem because you know the family is not together throughout the year So that was uh another recommendation which we proposed And again thirdly we said that there was a need to coordinate these environmental management uh projects and for us we said since Hashi was farther than Shinyanga it was best because it was in the position in fact if empowered it is in a position to coordinate even this church organization or whatever because for the they started I think they were on the right track provided that they are given some uh uh powers economically empowered at least to carry out their activities because they were really constrained in terms of resources Even the district council uh they couldn't do much because the district forest officer I think natural resource officer had a motorcycle while those in the division had bicycles which is really cannot manage the harsh condition of Shinyanga So those were some of the  propositions which we made and because others were very specific to SHISCAP project\n<$C> I have another interesting question Ave You know that whenever you do a research you have hopes of a possible solution to the problem Uh now how did you manage to convince people in Shinyanga that their problems are getting to be solved soon\n<$B> In fact uh during that research we were doing both uh sensitization and research So during our research we used also to try and educate them the importance of having those projects like Hashi within their locality and uh the importance of them their participation fully because we said these people of Hashi you are just blaming them for nothing because first of all they are not Sokumas Their region doesn't have this desertification problem They are here to assist you so unless you cooperate if you think this methodology is not good for you sit down and discuss with them but not to start sabotaging In fact if you are sabotaging a programme it means you are just sabotaging your development So we used to go and campaign like that So for us we think that people's participation is more crucial and nobody can go and solve the problem of uh environment in Shinyanga except for Shinyanga people themselves Others will just come to assist and give them direction but the problem will be solved by themselves So this is what we used to campaign to them and in fact for these few who have decided to take up this environmental management on their family level we decided to take them as an example in fact Even during our dissemination seminar we invited them and they gave their personal you know views So it was really of help because they say ha so this is my colleague he's my neighbour and he's doing wonderful things to solve his or her problem Why not me", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'eae24ac8-f364-4637-94c1-9bf2ade12f7b', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.092711+00:00',

to help the modern doctor to offer his services So where else the traditional medicine man could offer services alone uh the modern doctor cannot do that in isolation and he has to get services from other trained cadres \n<$A> Yeah it's uh interesting to know uh what medicine is Now I'm just wondering is there something maybe the modern uh doctor \n<$B> doctor uh has over a period of time evolved his way of treating maybe by herbs roots etcetera Now there are hardly any roots or herbs being used in modern medicine But over the centuries a few of the active ingredients have been identified which were in plants and are already being used in modern medicine in modern possible modern tablet form etcetera In that way maybe you can say he has borrowed But in terms of scientific analysis uh there is quite a lot of difference between the traditional medicine man and the modern doctor \n<$A> Okay Doctor uh talking about traditional medicine and modern medicine well I do not want to go back to that but uh there's this question of culture and uh we found that uh in most cases modern disciplines or even when you talk about development in any other way field you find that uh you can't really operate without uh taking into consideration the cultural environment I do not know how maybe you should tell us this how modern medicine operates in a situation where it's a relative newcomer \n<$B> Thank you very much Now modern medicine has you could say has a few disadvantages and I'm and uh you might not be aware that modern doctors also try to study uh what we would call medical sociology in which case they try to understand the community in which they operate They try to know the background of the individuals they treat Now it's quite uh uh possible sometimes that the modern doctor will go against some cultural beliefs without his knowing now something the traditional doctors would not have done But as I said before the modern doctor tries as much as possible to understand the community in which he operates in which he treats and even further to try and understand the background of the individual he's treating Now that way he is able not to uh to annoy or to fail because of cultural misunderstanding \n<$C> uh it's interesting uh that particular cultural dimension but I'm just wondering of course there are some cultures which uh some people have grown through and what they see is that uh they stick on them so much But some of these cultural beliefs might be detrimental to the health of the of the person For example somebody could be suffering from an ailment an ailment which is curable by modern medicine and this person refuses or would like to go against the advice of the modern doctor Now in such a case if it is a life-threatening ailment you as a doctor what is your responsibility Do you just leave the person to die I mean because of his cultural beliefs \n<$B> Well of course there are very there are very uh some there are very difficult situations sometimes where the individual holds so dearly to his cultural beliefs that go against the practice of modern medicine but that in itself should not be a deterrent by the modern doctor to try and understand and convince the individual Now talking about culture it's as if it's with assumption that the modern cultures if you want to call them so modern cultures are themselves without any detrimental mental effect to health of an individual which is not true So each culture has its own detrimental effects to the health of an individual uh whether it's modern of the so-called modern cultures or Western cultures and the traditional traditional cultures too have their own detrimental effects onto the modern medicine So none of the cultures you would say is without fault looking at it from a medical point of view \n<$A> Well now in that situation as a doctor how do you synthesise these two cultures Because especially for a doctor who is a an African and who is uh himself uh kind of stems from these contradicting cultures Well as an African culture you have the traditional culture to an extent and of course the whole education system you have imbibed the modern culture so these kinds of conflicts you also experience them I should suppose even at the personal level So how do you kind of strike this balance \n<$B> Well thank you very much Fortunately if I'd put it this way Fortunately no culture is static And over time you find people gradually accept things they would not or their grandparents would not have accepted uh since cultures are evolving in their nature you find that the doctor has to face these difficulties that's for sure and some of them some of the how you overcome some of the difficulties is more by the experience You cannot even when you talk about African cultures you find that the practice some of the practice you find in say Kenya or in parts of Kenya are totally different in another part of Kenya in the same Now of course that is multiplied many times over if you're talking about the whole of Africa so if you are transplanted from Kenya say to Lesotho I have not been there it's possible that the difficulties that you meet would be totally different and you have over time to gradually align yourself to the new uh difficulties and find new solutions \n<$C> uh maybe uh something that's also very much related to culture is uh religion or religious beliefs I don't know how you would uh deal with somebody who uh is a religious fanatic who believes that uh for example maybe it's just prayer that uh will bring about uh the healing of that particularly ailment I don't know how you would comment on that \n<$B> Well it's I must admit it's a very difficult question Now it's difficult because if for instance the individual has an illness that is communicable that can transmit from one individual to the other then I think that individual by law should seek treatment Now if on the other hand it's an illness that is not communicable now you find that you're kind of walking a tight rope uh whether to force the individual to take to seek medical attention or otherwise Now of course there are many religious situations one that comes to mind is Jehovah's' Witness Now the individuals in that faith believe that it's wrong to take blood either by mouth or by vein Now when an individual like that comes and tells you Doctor please don't give me blood it does not matter whether I die or I don't Now I think it's all proper to respect the wishes of that individual and find alternatives if there are any I don't know of many alternatives where blood is concerned but you must find alternatives and you must respect the wishes of that individual and not give him blood if so if he so desires \n<$C> uh maybe just to add on that You see here are the prime uh the prime uh reason uh of a doctor I mean the prime uh what a doctor is trained in is actually preservation of life and I would not really uh I'm not really I'm wondering if uh by leaving that particular person I mean his wishes to prevail and those wishes uh are life-threatening for example if you the wishes are granted uh the person will of course die Now you as a doctor I mean how do you come \n<$B> Well I let me come in here \n<$A> Yes \n<$B> Yes I don't think it's a question of leaving the individual to die Like I said it is uh not necessarily that the individual will die It's possible that he'll survive but have the illness prolonged \n<$A> Which of course will eventually lead him to \n<$B> maybe \n<$A> his death \n<$B> Now but that's not all I must first correct by saying that a doctor although trained to save lives that's not all There are some patients that doctors will not be able to treat There are some patients who will be far gone Now if you if your illness is so such a in such a state that you cannot be treated you cannot be cured of the illness now does that mean the doctor has no role No of course not The doctor has a role to make that individual comfortable to end to the end So it not excuse me it's not just that a doctor must or is trained only to preserve or to uh life No he is also trained to make life a little more comfortable And in actual fact maybe more than anything else every doctor should be able to try and make life comfortable for his patients So that's not all the prolongation of life is not all Now let me give you an example and this calls for uh other arguments When a person or an individual is so ill that he has got actual brain damage uh to a point where you could actually say he has got brain death and he is being supported on machines now how long do you want to prolong that life You could possibly theoretically prolong it for a long long time Now does one want to preserve that kind of life That is not seeing that is not thinking that is actually not essentially perceiving anything and is not appreciating anything So it's difficult and you cannot quite say that doctors are only trained uh to preserve life Now that is one The other one is like we previously discussed about cultures a doctor has also to practise medicine to individuals who have their own cultural background who have their own beliefs and personally I believe that uh an individual is not just a body is not just a life One has one has his spiritual beliefs and I think they are part of him as much as the physical life we as we know it Thank you \n<$A> Thank you doctor but uh I think the question that uh I would like to maybe deduce from the discussion is uh the question of authority vis-a-vis the patient Well the doctor's authority over the patient if any because like uh my colleague here is saying sometimes it's like the doctor in trying to accommodate the wishes of the patient Well does he compromise maybe his uh professional obligation and then of course there is also the question of uh does the doctor have the authority to demand of a patient or somebody who is ill to seek attention from uh a doctor", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '6c3dd527-ef37-47ca-8a86-e7d8dd5c0de4', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.125741+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': "<$A> we call them street children And what do you have to say about this\n<$B> Okay you see these are not only street children They're the most neglected in the community Why should they be neglected why \n<$A> This uh this is an issue uh a parent can be single yeah Maybe a mother gives a child birth to a child out of wedlock This is a case that can arise where the mother can throw this kid away maybe through abortion where this kid is eventually brought up in that kind of rubbish way whereby the kid just walks around the streets \n<$C> But the rubbish what do you mean You know that they actually live near the rubbish heaps That's where they learn how to <O/> \n<$B> That's not the issue The issue is why should we live in such good homes and why should they live in such in the streets why \n<$A> I think the problem here is society particularly if a child is brought up in uh a well-off family where the uh parents can take care of the child Why should this child end up in the slums in the streets\n<$C> No I think it's because I think you know some parents they don't have money Others you know other people The these children are usually get thrown maybe because they don't have any money okay their parents didn't have any money to take care of those children That's the main reason \n<$B> So are you trying to say it's 'cause of family planning that some children are there out in the streets \n<$C> Yeah it's because of that \n<$B> These years there's a family which can have maybe twenty children ten boys and ten girls <$C> Excuse me where is the lady that can have ten girls\n<$B> Yeah it's possible Maybe uh uh a man has three wives yeah each of those wives has four children \n<$C> Yeah it's\n<$B> She can come to and you end up by ten So you find these children in the streets So what has this what role does the government has towards those children Because it's the responsibility of the government to take care of those children \n<$A> I don't think it's the government only I think it's society too that is to blame\n<$C> No there it's you know I think it's okay it's the society to some extent But you know the government also should look for uh uh a home for these children \n<$A> But you see there are various homes in the city uh nursing homes are there Children's homes are there <ea/>Mama Ngina children's home Don't you think it's also not possible because there are so many thousands and thousands of street children If this won't help \n<$B> But see the point still stands if society paid enough taxes to facilitate such homes I think then there would be no kid in the streets What do you have to say about that one\n<$C> I think Austin is right because the society also here is to blame The people who throw out these children if they're found I think they should be dealt with\n<$B> How about maybe chasing these street children there back to school or away from the streets What could\n<$C> I think chasing them away from the streets would work It would really do some good The police should be put on the streets 'cause these children are a real problem \n<$B> But when you chase them off the streets where do they go \n<$C> That is Okay if they are chased from the street they just have to go to they have they'll be disturbing people in essence So I think what should be done is the police should be put everywhere So if those children start running everywhere they should be stopped\n<$B> So in other words you're saying it's the children to blame \n<$C> No it's not the children to blame uh\n<$A> Don't think also if you also chase away these kids from the streets then this problem of crime drug abuse and whatever what-have-you\n<$B> My friend this problem's already there What are you trying to say\n<$C> Yeah <$A> No I'm trying to say yeah if just someone okay I'm a street child yeah they thrust me out into the street I eat there out of those dustbins and I even sleep there When I'm just away from that street I'll go to maybe a village somewhere or I'll rest somewhere I start maybe uh stealing things from there I steal the food I do all that Okay imagine I'm only one What about the numbers that will be chased away from the street \n<$B> But don't you think this still happens until today whether they're chased or not They simply going to steal Yes\n<$C> They there there's still a lot of crime and they've been pickpocketing people and so the crime rate will still be there But I'm just telling you that it's a good way to keep them out of the streets At least they should be taken to a home somewhere or at least they should just be kept off because the streets are certainly not a good place\n<$B> But you see every start has to have its end If you throw them out of the streets where do they go Where do you put them Do you have a place where you're going to keep them while you're throwing them out you see what happens \n<$B> Yeah there should be some organisation which can provide a home for these children \n<$B> So mainly it's the government which has still to provide this organisation\n<$C> Right yeah\n<$B> Okay\n<$A> Don't you think there are organisations even up to now and they\n<$C> But there are not enough that's what I'm trying to tell you \n<$A> Okay I know there are not enough okay I understand there are not enough But even if you brought up hundreds and even if the world bank came around to assist in this project \n<$C> uh\n<$A> it would not still work \n<$C> why\n<$A> It's that parent who is supposed to control the child \n<$C> no it's not\n<$A> and it's that teacher at school who is supposed to educate the children about family planning\n<$C> I don't think so because you can't just talk like that You know this problem is not exactly family planning problem Some people they get okay they get children out of wedlock and they're forced others maybe they're forced to throw those children It's not 'cause of family planning only \n<$A> But it's \n<$B> In that case it's still family planning You're getting those children who you <$A> whom \n<$C> Okay you don't have to raise your voice when we're just talking \n<$B> Okay It's okay fine \n<$A> Now uh uh only let's address ourselves to the legal part of it Why don't we establish laws which govern these uh the retrieval and maybe punishment of these street children because some of these children are under eighteen and you'll find that when they're taken to court <O/> just allow them to go or take them to juvenile prisons which I think is not helping much\n<$C> I think the law is not the case The law is there But you see these children they cannot There is nothing else they can do because it's not their fault \n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> That one we know\n<$C> The children if they're being taken to court I think it's help they're helped I mean if they're arrested the ones who are arrested Because there are some children they're going uh uh Those are kids uh uh uh It was in the papers There was a car passing okay \n<$A/<$B> Yes \n<$C> And then there are these five children They looked as if they were about fifteen years old \n<$A/<$B> Yes \n<$C> They came and tried to move There was traffic so this car had stopped It was a newish car it was quite new So now these children tried removing the wheelcaps from the car and the car was moving Don't you think that's dangerous for even the children \n<$A> What\n<$C> Then \n<$A> What I strongly think is it's not only the children I think it's the coins that that society gives them and which influences them to buy drugs They smoke glue and\n<$C> Yeah I think that's right \n<$A> all the bad things that distorts their thinking ability What do you think about that <ea/>Bwana \n<$B> Me I feel if we are responsible citizens yeah the best thing is to do if you're aware of just pick this child and try to see if you can guide and even \n<$C> excuse me\n<$B> and even maybe give that child some advice \n<$C> Excuse me <ea/>Bwana it's not easy for people to come and pick children from the streets because those people also have their families You can't talk like that I think what you should be talking about right now is trying to form some organisations to help these children\n<$B> But who is supposed to form these organisations \n<$C> The government \n<$B> not\n<$C> No \n<$B> Okay the government made out of the people is not a government So it's the person who's supposed to be dealing with the problem \n<$C> Because you know people cannot people You know everyone is also looking for money No one can start saying people should go there and should pick children from the streets to take them home Now how many folk can afford to do that Can you go and take a child from the street and \n<$B> Okay let me give you a case in question If you come across a very good young girl in the streets picking that bread that uh fermented bread to eat So you feel mercy for this child\n<$C> You mean the rotten bread \n<$B> Yeah you feel mercy for this child You don't you think you'll have some kind of kindness in you to pick this child and take it to your home maybe even the chief's camp and try to assist this child You won't do that\n<$C> What do you mean I won't do that \n<$B> You cannot be able to do that I'm asking you a question\n<$C> But uh I've not said that I cannot do that But what do you think about that uh <ea/>Bwana\n<$A> No what I think is you're being very busy Do you know what happens is when once you take these kids to the like the chief's camp What can the chief do with them \n<$C> \n<$B> The chief has a responsibility to  assist the whole locality \n<$C> uh can I please interrupt You know what the chiefs here in in fact I don't think there are any chiefs here in Nairobi \n<$B> There are There's a chief in Kasaranie\n<$A> There's a chief here in Kasaranie Or here opposite for example\n<$C> Okay yes but the chiefs I'm sorry to say the chiefs are very busy with other things They cannot start helping those children Then\n<$A> Yeah I strongly agree with all this \n<$C> Then the money that those children are given by the society the people you think should help them That money it's not enough to do anything They simply take that money and go and buy rubber the rubber that they start sniffling\n<$A> You mean the glue \n<$C> the glue\n<$B> You see I'm not suggesting that these kids are supposed be given money These kids are supposed to be brought up in a responsible way\n<$A> But by who\n<$C> By who the government\n<$B> It's the chief and the uh the chief represents the government and the top yeah\n<$C> But the chief cannot do much \n<$A> Yeah you cannot expect the chief to remove money from his own pocket \n<$C> From his own pocket that's what I'm telling you \n<$B> Okay for example it's like maybe a relief fund yeah Maybe in Kitui So do you expect that chief in Kitui not to be uh knowledgeable about his people \n<$C> Excuse me <ea/>Bwana you're going around the question\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> You Before you said that you bring the children from the streets \n<$B> Yes\n<$C> To the chief The chief cannot remove money from his pocket What can the chief do \n<$A> What can the chief do with these children\n<$B> Okay the idea is we're going to decentralise this problem", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

African socialism \n<$B> \n<$A> Do we have \n<$B> You see many people tend to think that uh it is that many of the ideas used in Africa socially politically are borrowed ideas There is a really bit of truth of that but not the whole truth You see some of the  things you are saying are borrowed ideas things like democracy  things like this are not necessarily borrowed Maybe you are using the Greek term that's right but the practice itself is human\n<$?> \n<$B> And to say that therefore they're foreign is that that is academic imperialialism you see \n<$C> But professor \n<$B> Now uh yah \n<$C> Professor uh uh uh I still want to probe the African focus I still want to find that this conference is going to be there and will be utilised to the full by the African thinkers And again I still want to fall back to the unfortunate fact that Africa at the moment is marginalized What are some of what is it we expect to get out of this conference in terms of thematic interests \n<$B> \n<$C> Yah what themes are we addressing that will bring Africans not only as a problematic continent but as a continent that has got a future a continent that has got a past \n<$B> When you say that Africa is being marginalized I don't agree with that wholly but maybe Africa is being marginalized economically We can say a lot later but I don't think that Africa is marginalized politically Africa is still a very important force politically in the world Ah I don't think that Africa is being marginalized intellectually if we take ourselves seriously Africa is still a force academically and there is lot of potential we have However certain things are happening for example some of the African academic intellectuals may be leaving their own country to go and live outside\n<$?> \n<$B> But that is because of economic  reasons perhaps But uh in terms of ideas in terms of scholarship I don't think that we should reconcile ourselves to saying that we are marginalized and that we should wait for lead from abroad \n<$?> But I think \n<$?> let me see uh \n<$?> I would tend to uh have a different uh uh understanding of that uh especially in the sense that the kind of uh technology that we are trying to uh uh copy or even to harness for our own development has been developed on a philosophy that was developed uh outside of uh Africa and therefore even when we are saying that uh we have lots of uh intellectuals that have uh that are homegrown and that could actually in fact uh turn around uh the uh events and the situations in Africa so that we can catch up are we not really jumping onto the bandwagon too long uh uh long after the engine is has gone uh \n<$?> uh \n<$?> Is that really possible for us to say we'll march on to this philosophy \n<$?> uh \n<$?> and hope maybe to better the uh situation of the African \n<$B> Yes yes this is fact is the right time because uh I think that the philosophies of the west of the so called developed countries are collapsing I think that Marxism is being seen to be collapsing isn't it And I that is hiding another fact \n<$?> \n<$B> uh yeah that's not that also the western type of laissez-faire capitalism is also collapsing but because marxism\n<$?> \n<$B> is collapsing faster this is all <O/> we need the new philosophies\n<$?> \n<$B> and Africa is in the best position to help produce this \n<$?> Yes Professor Marxism is not collapsing and in fact as a philosophy it's not collapsing it \n<$B> uh \n<$?> it is a mode of thinking \n<$B> yeah \n<$?> and it can't collapse and it will remain Marxism Uh what is collapsing perhaps are those who have tried to use it in terms of uh uh technological advancement \n<$?> Yeah \n<$?> but Marxism remains with its rich philosophy it remains with its in fact inherent body of knowledge that can be useful \n<$?> Yes \n<$?> forever so it can't collapse Uh but the point that perhaps we should focus onto now is my interest on the themes of this conference in terms of bringing up Africa on top of the world if you like And I have in mind this conference happening when we have refugees uh uh uh uh all over the place when we have uh good people dying in Sudan and in Ethiopia You see them on the screens you see them in magazines and in newspapers dying because of the environmental hazards that are coupled with politics So are we going to sit in Nairobi philosophize and exchange of views and not address such grim realities in Africa That's why I'm pushing onto this thematic interest of the conference \n<$?> the general theme of the conference is *interdisciplinitary> and we say the  problem><-+problems> of environment are not only physical uh  problem><-+problems>\n<$?> Yes \n<$?> They're also a human problem \n<$?> \n<$?> and the refugee problem is an environmental problem \n<$?> Yes \n<$?> and should be addressed by scholars \n<$?> Yes \n<$?> and it's not just sitting to philosophize it's sitting maybe it's philosophizing on the practical  problem><-+problems>\n<$?> Yes \n<$?> Yeah\n<$?> so I cannot suggest for you here what kind of answers or \n<$?> Yeah uh indeed indeed indeed \n<$?> but such  problem><-+problems>are relevant to the general theme \n<$?> So how much have you involved uh your partners in ithis field because you have you're talking about philosophers who are practical and that would be the direction of the thinking of that day What involvement have you uh arranged for governments for NGOs and and such like organisations that may be useful in terms of translating some of the views into tangible reality \n<$B> Oh yes we have a connection with a number of NGOs who are lending us support either in kind or materially We have support for example from Rockefeller <+_a> little support from Foundation We have the support from Codesria\n<$?> Yes\n<$B> <O/> know them uh we are uh uh having some bit of promise of support from UNEP we also have invited their director to give one of the uh to talk We have uh support from uh organisation in Nairobi like Initiative which is African Centre for Science and Technology We have support from Ford Foundation We have support from African Insitute in New York We have support from Kenya National Academy of Science We have some kind of support from University of Nairobi Press and so on <$?> Now Professor the uh I'll probably uh ask Dr Mbai the general I wouldn't say the general probably the normal view of the man in the street of the African philosopher is of a person dabbling in high theory and mostly at the university uh and with very little to do with our ordinary lives uh or even I mean there is no coordination between those who implement like the leaders for example Do our philosophers actually have both the clout the because you need that to tell our leaders where they go wrong for example Can the philosophers aware our leaders in Africa all over Africa I mean because something must be wrong when a continent is beset by so many problems Are the philosophers in the forefront of pointing out these problems and probably providing solutions or suggesting solutions \n<$?> Added to that Mr Chairman if I may put a footnote There was as uh I think recently there was a meeting a conference in Nyeri of uh scientific uh researchers And one of the complaints was that uh research has has now moved away from the old pedestal of where you research and publish and once you've published you sit back and say yes I'm a researcher and I'm a thinker uh so so that links up to what he's saying uh to what extent are we going to do this and fail to in fact impact \n<$?> Yes\n<$?> write books and advise our leaders in whatever \n<$?> Yes \n<$?> areas socially politically and otherwise I mean are the philosophers actually taking the lead to advise us on what to do\n<$A> What do you mean I mean if you ask whether  philosophers are taking the lead to advise us philosophers are taking the lead in what is philosophical Yes they're doing that\n<$?> What is philosophical \n<$A> and when you talk of advising our leaders uh who are your leaders I mean uh I \n<$?> Leaders in various fields\n<$A> D'you mean \n<$?> I mean you can have scientists for example \n<$A> Do you mean only political leaders \n<$?> No no no both political leaders uh \n<$?> decision maker\n<$?> decision maker\n<$?> Yes \n<$?> Yes yeah yeah \n<$?> people who \n<$?> I mean do you involve when you when you \n<$?> the philosophers \n<$A> as far as the leaders in their duty have certain problems which they need intellectual answers to They need academic solutions to\n<$?> Yes \n<$A> and in so far as those problems are known to philosophers and scientists uh the philosophers and scientists do discuss this usually \n<$?> Among \n<$B> at two\n<$?> themselves \n<$A> among themselves at two level I say \n<$?> Yes\n<$A> among themselves and get what they think about them At the second level where if the leaders are willing to engage these  philosophers these  scientists and throw the problem to them they also engage in that and respond to the leader's request \n<$?> Now uh Professor I think uh uh as a follow a followRRR up to that there is always this uh uh conflict of uh possibilities when a philosopher is supposed to be the person operating on rational uh thinking and rational solutions But in certain situations we find public opinion that uh takes uh uh the day that carries the day And I do not know whether you'd agree with me that uh sometimes uh public opinion may not be uh may not always be right Well how does a philosopher get uh around that?\n<$B> Mr Chairman this is a very interesting question and it is interesting because I think that uh philosophy has been regarded with suspicion And the people have thought that philosophy must be uh it it creates trouble \n<$B> that philosophy uh makes people riot or things like that which is not really what philosophy is all about Now that view is as mistaken as the view that philosophy is just an abstract you know kind of subject I think that a good philosopher is not that one who simply thinks and then goes to bed after thinking but a man who not only thinks but also acts You see Having thought and having come to certain conclusion do you do something about it Now it is one thing of course to give good advice but what people do with that advice is a different thing \n<$?> \n<$B> The philosopher will will give his <.-/>his opinion sometimes you know expert Just again expert for example the economists will give you advice on how to proceed If you want to go there this is the way to get there but now it's up to you whether you take that advice and do something with it or you just sit on it But the problem is that I think the philosophers very often are not actually listened to \n<$> But I would ask a question for example uh both Plato and Aristotle are <O/> They not only enunciated a philosophy they also oh and even Marx afterwards Marx and Hegel and so on they not only enunciated philosophies they also uh set out prescriptions on how to implement those things \n<$?> \n<$?> say forms of government for example what forms of government are relevant in order to achieve whatever they had enunciated as as uh a political philosophy \n<$?> Uh in our African context I haven't seen that I mean we miss that that not only I mean they write about theories and so on and so on but nobody actually tells us okay in Africa probably uh we had societies like this like uh in Meru Njogu Chagga or something like that and uh\n<$?> Ah that cannot

{'text': "<$A> you know they argue that when a woman passes and a man passes there is a distinct difference in the corridor I mean my office is situated but when a woman passes she wants to be noticed so there is this woman the woman and her mirror which is trying to suggest Maybe it's not yet been developed but we'd suggest it but you know the women in this feminist movement are just trying to assert in words what has been refused and rejected by society in deeds How do you react to that because you put on flamboyantly and walk on Fridays You know the streets are normally a fashion show especially for women But no man cares how he put on I can repeat my dress my coat seven times Nobody cares \n<$B> You know what is amazing is that after all this discussion you still seem to be putting the blame on the woman I find this very strange because when you say that the woman you know has her mirror Who has given the woman this value you know that's what I really like to take you back to \n<$A> She picked her mirror herself\n<$B> No no no she didn't Who even told the man that he could get away with a dirty shirt for one week It's the society and what we are saying is that right now there's a sense in which we might want to start shifting the blame from the woman's shoulder and in fact what I was saying is We don't even want to put the blame on the man's shoulder We want to be in this together and we want to say that as much as we value our customs and our beliefs if we are to recognise changes that have taken place where we are here and now We need to readdress and reconsider some of the things that we have said And I would say that for example I wouldn't myself be worried if a man said that I had my own mirror and I want him to notice me I think this is all right We are not renouncing our femininity Some women I'm a woman I'm happy being about being a woman And if I had a colleague who treated me as if I was a man I think I would to some extent be offended The point is when does my femininity come up and when does my professionalism come up I would expect my colleague to realise that just like I as a woman can be seen from two points of view the woman in me that is the biological female and then the whatever status I have he also has the same and the society tends to try to get the woman to choose between these two Why should I have to choose If I'm a professional woman if I'm in the women's liberation I'm still a woman I should still dress and look nice If the society has said and put a lot of premium on the women's appearance what who is the woman to fight against the society \n<$A> Yes there I think you have a point\n<$C> Well Mr chairman I think that what Doctor Oduol is saying is all right but I think uh we should not look at society in that impersonal sense because when we look at society and the values and norms which it uses to pattern the people's conduct still they're made by human beings And I'm wondering whether the difference in the biological sense between male and male I mean female and male have not implications in the I mean the role differentiation because I think some of them when you look at the socialisation process it is somehow based on the physiological differences surely I'm wondering whether the the biological nature of a woman does not in any way make her suitable to perform certain functions in society as well as men\n<$B> Would you like to give some examples\n<$C> Well I'm wondering for example whether it will be suitable for example for a woman to go hunting and even why some take to boxing Well I think uh this \n<$?> <O/> Australia\n<$C> I can't take a woman to box uh uh in the ring and start boxing her as Even me I'll probably be having a punch in the breast which is very sensitive in the way of pressure \n<$B> You know what I would say is that you are actually displaying the very very you know biased sexual custom and your beliefs and this is what the feminists are fighting You should give everybody a chance There are women out there who I think would crush you They're body builders they have muscles you know All they need to do is they have to break the societal norms They would defy what is seen as feminine The society has said that to be a woman you're supposed to be you know much more conscious about your beauty your appearance You're supposed to be delicate be a little weak Don't be You don't be fit don't have muscles the society has said that \n<$?> but\n<$B> But if a woman opts to and we do have women wrestlers We do have women you know weightlifters There are women who even now in Nairobi if we were to maybe call them for an announcement there are women who'd come up The question is why are most of the women not doing this Most women are not doing that because the society does not expect women to do it Brings us back to our very argument Feminism is saying look you society there is male and there is female Then there are activities and roles in this world You have decided some are masculine others are feminine Why have you insisted that they must remain like that There is nothing other than just biological like lactation and pregnancy This is what nobody is going to complain about Motherhood that you cannot complain about but beyond that all these things we are talking about are just patronising When you tell a woman that you most likely will land a blow on her breast she sees your patronising attitude You're just thinking about her breast You didn't have to think about her breast \n<$?> because you're a man you are not going to land it anywhere\n<$C> Look what I am saying is look I think it is it is a biological fact that given the biological sex of the woman and even the *hormonic> the hormones you know I think the the hormones prepare the body for certain particular functions and for example even if you look at your skin and mine surely Doctor Oduol I'm sure you can see that mine is rough \n\n<$C> and this is not that I took not to care for it It is because my hormone does not \n<$A> allow you to\n<$C> yeah to be softer skinned This is\n<$B> You know beyond saying I would say myself that as far as the limitations would be in regard to pregnancy and lactation for example that you're not going to do anything about But all these things you are talking about you can go and play a ladygame\n<$C> It won't work What happens there is Don't you I think there is the biological structure of the sexes I think prepare them for particular roles\n<$A> Okay we'll leave that we can't solve it It's so tough \nBut let us talk about this uh It's a social issue a question of segregation You know it has been argued that feminism is a *segregative> movement you know In America recently I'm having in mind this particular case where women got married to other women to avoid male dominance for example I think you are aware of it You know they argue that you see I have to get married to my fellow woman who we are equal and I mean we shall play complementary roles in the in our house in our home you know they call it home but I call it home in quote Now what would you say about this that it is a *segregative> movement It is only caring about uh uh female issues female affairs and if to some extent and uh very patronising extent children affairs\n<$B> I would say that uh it is a movement that is looking at those who are being so far mistreated by society who in their perception feel that they are the underdogs and I would compare this to maybe racial liberation you know when you think of the Americans when the Blacks were fighting against the Whites It's usually the ideological power structure that is presented by society's values that makes those who are subordinate or who feel that they are subordinated to fight back and I was going to say that with regard to this issue of women marrying other women I'm aware that that is happening for many women and this takes us back to the question which I pointed out at the beginning that the general aim or goal of all feminists is to change the angle of perception so that women are not just looked down upon because of their biological distinction because women don't think this is fair Society has demonstrated that it is not fair The manner in which they do it vary There are those women who say now that there is feminism I can be a woman and proud of it I can be a mother and I can also be a professional and I can be proud because nobody is going to say you are just a mere woman you can't do this On the other hand there are women who have said now I don't want to be a woman because being a woman is in terms of the society humiliating exactly what you were saying before a woman is a woman These other women are saying whatever I do even if I should I mean I weightlift even if I become a prime minister even if I become what this is what people still say a woman is a woman so this one say now I don't have to be a woman anymore I need never be a mother They say that I need never be somebody's wife I am going to be something less humiliating because they are saying being women has been humiliating and I think that we people in the society are responsible for this And what we need to do is to understand what is involved and maybe create an atmosphere where this woman doesn't have to feel humiliated by being a woman\n<$A> Then you bring me to this question Can feminism be compatible with motherhood and to what extent and uh uh to what extentRRR have the married women married mothers you know it's funny married mothers \n<$C> Lesbianism is it lesbianism \n<$A> No I just got I want to use the married mothers only in the real sense Yeah \n<$C> Okay married mothers in that sense\n<$A> yeah\n<$B> And not those who are not single mothers\n<$A> those who are not single mothers yeah To what extent have they contributed to this low status of women that uh you know feminism is fighting to this negative image that feminism is fighting to what extent is this housewife uh what role has she played in this negativity of the feminist\n<$B> Okay what I would say is that if we look at feminism and see it as having different faces you know it could be the face of a woman who wants to present herself as a woman and who says I am a woman and I'm asking for respect and I'm proud of being a womanThen you can look at it with the other face The feminist face that says being a woman is humiliating I am glad that feminism is around because the concept woman was my slave name and was used to mitigate against me and I'm going to go all out to make sure that I free myself from it", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

We had agreed earlier that drugs can be put to good use It's when you do not use them the way they're intended to be used \n<$?>Let's say we cannot manufacture medicine because they're not\n<$?> we agreed from what <name/> told us last time \n<$A> Okay let's not go back to that\n<$C> people are allowed to take this thing as a relaxation The moment you take it more than that limit today then definitely you are <O/>\n<$B> Look my issue was not the my issue was not the consumption my issue was \n<$A> the economical\n<$B> the economical aspect because even the <ea/>chang'aa brewer who is brewing that <ea/>chang'aa he is doing it for a purpose somehow to make you know to bring up some kids up You know somebody else somewhere who is selling <ea/>bhang he is doing it for a specific purpose But then how do we balance the two You see \nYeah\n<$A> It's like saying this It's like this one saying this If I can use heroin you're telling me if I can use heroin or cocaine or <ea/>bhang and pay for it the person who is getting that money is benefiting So the country should justify it because there is some economic activity going on\n<$A> is benefiting from that\n<$B> No no it's not that I'm saying some of the things that are used to making these drugs somehow if somebody decided they'll produce this to make drug somebody somewhere is going to suffer Even <O/> the whole country might suffer But what I was asking is how we ourselves like the way we are the four of us five of us How we can balance between the two The economic aspect\n<$C> No No The problem is really uh \n<$B> The thing is to whom this drug is going to and the use it is going to be put into So if Kenya Breweries uh manufactures ten crates of beer a day and this beer is tended into one person one person takes the whole thing at a go then to me that's an abuse\n<$?> It's an abuse\n<$?> No no let me say something \n<$?> Just a minute\n<$?> Okumba you\n<$B> Yeah The point is uh the Breweries has benefited in getting the money but somebody else had spent so much money for something that is not economically beneficial to them\n<$A> Let's not go too much into aspects of brewing and why it should be brewed Let's look at what is happening What effects are these drugs having on the youth Especially when we consider that it's a big big problem It's getting lethal It's worse It's bad \n<$D> I think uh what I may say here is uh one of these facts is definitely that the drug reduces your life span You die early And when you die early that means you know the country has lost a resource you see So if we multiply the number of people using that drug you know you know in a local area by the area of the whole country the population of a whole country then we find that we may be losing a lot of people And we are talking of schools\n<$D> yeah you're talking of school children you're talking of people who are <O/> sports you see what's promised using drugs \n<$?> Exactly\n<$?> They can lose their ability to run\n<$?> Exactly\n<$?> And the fact the dangerous fact is \n<$?> the dangerous fact\n<$?> Exactly and the fact that this drug makes you really run faster It now goes to interfere with your \n<$?> Natural abilities\n<$?> Yes exactly If you don't have that drug you're not going to run as fast And that way we're going to produce an addict who could otherwise excel even better than <name/> you see So actually it is a question whereby the usage of this thing has got numerous you know disadvantages in our society not forgetting the other socio-economic factors like divorce and uh violence at home because we have come to know drug users as people who are generally violent \n<$?> Drunken husbands\n<$?> Exactly\n<$?> Even drunken drivers\n<$?> Exactly The sense of reason that will not really arise in your head anymore for so much of\n<$?> You mind gets <O/>\n<$?> Exactly\n<$?> To support it you can say that most of uh most of the accidents that you are having nowadays are caused by drugs There have been cases of these Aids you know This one thing is so prevalent and which people tend to ignore but it's a reality anyway We find that somebody somewhere <slang/>'cos he has taken some few drinks he feels now you know I don't know\n<$?> You can become reckless\n<$?> You can become reckless you know you just be quiet and say who cares <O/> Maybe the drug is changing you In fact <O/> I don't take the drug\n<$A> In fact <name/> you have said a point that is quite pertinent because most Aids victims are also drug addicts \n<$?> I believe that's true \n<$A> They are drug addicts The way they inject themselves with the drugs exposes them to Aids And like you've said when you abuse a drug too much you tend to take too many risks You kind of throw caution to the wind so you *indelve> yourself in some maybe actions that may lead to diseases and things like that There are road accidents because of people maybe not being careful after having taken one too many\n<$?> And there is a breakdown also in the in the social in the social fabric you know people lose respect I mean you know you don't care who is around you can say anything you know So that there is that loosening of uh uh and this is something which is \n<$?> of morals\n<$?> yeah the morals and it's not something which only occurs with the youth You find even parents you know adults who have gone and had one too many you know come back <O/> They just don't give a damn I mean they don't care what they are saying\n<$?> There is one aspect that always tends to be invisible but if plays a very major role okay take for example a taxi driver okay He has to bring in so much money at the end of the day okay And the only way he can do that is properly stay awake What does he do He takes any kind of drug\n<$?> Even drunk\n<$?> Even drunk yes\n<$?> So here you are telling this guy must This is not right you know this shouldn't be he shouldn't take this Well this guy knows I have to earn a living I have to get so much money to my boss you know Because what I feel is that the innocent ones the guys that have always said that they don't touch the alcohol like the guys who own <ea/>matatus are the ones who are actually leading the minor victims into the touts\n<$?> We are talking about uh the question of uh pressure I mean people are under pressure \n<$?> which is unavoidable\n<$?> which is unavoidable And they take these uh these drugs which even increase pressure you know even then because they work overcapacity you see so there are people who just find they can't live they can't lead normal lives Yes it's just something which they have to do\n<$?> <Uha>\n<$?> Actually your lifespan is curtailed because you have been using these drugs for such a long time and the fact that you don't sleep yourself doesn't actually entitle even your thinking \n<$?> Yeah I suppose because It's not only <ea/>matatus or these other people\n<$?> You know you find that most of the people who work maybe during the night let's say for instance watchmen See to stay awake they need a drug or something Others need something to keep them going Truck drivers you know it's quite a lengthy lengthy process\n<$?> So what we do okay the effects are numerous Most of them are all of them are uh disadvantages\n<$?> Disadvantages\n<$?> Exactly\n<$?> Yes\n<$?> It is no good benefit for drugs unless it's prescribed it's used for the purpose it's supposed to be How about what you can do Okay the problem is enormous I don't think that we can start to believe we shall stop it But I think we could suggest ways in which you can prevent it from getting worse\n<$?> you know actually\n<$?> especially for our youth \n<$?> Exactly as far as I'm concerned as I said last time I'm against the fact that the law should be put into force you know complacently \n<$?> No we're talking about the youth\n<$?> exactly\n<$?> What can we do in schools\n<$?> yes\n<$?> on the streets\n<$?> Like what we have in schools is known as state education to also go hand in hand with counselling on drugs \n<$?> The problem now exactly the problem now this one is just touched in that whole uh subject But now a special chance to combat this drug business In fact there is a counselling tonight\n<$?> There is there is there's a special one\n<$?> People sit down in a in a classroom and they're talking about drugs the effects how to stop them and that kind of thing \n<$?> What I what I believe is\n<$?> What can I advise what can they do about themselves without having to wait for counsellors to come around and tell them\n<$?> The first thing before we go to the source I think the first thing that parents themselves should take that as an issue As a youth grows up try and talk to him so that later as he also grows up and needs the counsellors <name/> was talking about then he'll ask himself Why am I doing this But we can't just let a kid just go ahead growing up", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> continue the discussion on youth and religion And to discuss this topic further on my immediate right is Kamau\n<$B> hello  viewers\n<$A> and extreme right is Makhoha \n<$C> hello viewers\n<$A> On my left side Mkarasi\n<$D> hello viewers\n<$A> Nyongesa\n<$E> hello viewers \n<$A> and Ruth\n<$F> hello viewers\n<$A> Now the first question maybe we should dwell with is the increase in the number of religions we have in Kenya There is a constant increase in uh religion What response is there from the youth Does it mean that uh the interest of the youth to religion is on the increase or is it the reverse Ruth maybe you should start us off\n<$F> Okay I would say that it's both The youth the interest of the youth largely has reduced has decreased The modern youth these days are kind of removed from religion because of various reasons which we saw earlier on But I'd also say that uh to an extent their interest is also increasing because we can see by the fact that the youth these days are coming up with uh their own religion for example non denominational religion I don't want to call it religion but this is because they are they are not satisfied with uh the main the church whether it's catholic or Protestant So they feel there is something lacking so they'd like to start up their own uh we would call it sect non-denominational where they don't attach themselves to any particular religion But they just pray and uh they rely on the on the Bible So I'd say yes I think the increasing number of religions it is to an extent the youth their interest is increasing and also decreasing\n<$A> What would you say to that Nyongesa\n<$E> Uh well according to me I would be I will agree with her of course uh but uh on one hand we'd better look at the reasons why uh we're having an increasing number of religions Uh if you look at the reasons they won't have to say uh to point out that actually the interest is uh decreasing uh because look at the nowadays what you have is church wrangles and all that They are having leadership struggles such that we have so many sects breaking out of the streamline churches and you can't say this is because of religion in itself but sometimes the reason is not the church or they cannot be considered to be very fertile So what you have is if we have the number of sects increasing they're being broken off by who are already in churches You cannot say that this shows that there is uh that the interest of the youth is increasing because they may be out of the game all the time On the other hand if we look at it uh closely you might see that uh as she has said that uh with the increase of non- uh denominational churches we are getting the youth breaking off from the streamline churches the most of these established churches like uh like uh you can say uh the African Catholic Church What you have is that uh after feeling that there is something missing in these streamline churches what they do is to turn to these other churches because some of the other churches offer a wide range of activities There are sports a lot of social activities what the other churches don't offer So what you have is an increasing number uh an increasing interest in religion but on the overall I would say that the interest is decreasing rather than increasing we have a smaller number of the youth in churches other than before \n<$A> Well maybe I should put this question to you If uh the youth are breaking away from you know from the churches to form their own uh sects doesn't that mean that their interest in religion is becoming more because they're turning off from where they feel they're dissatisfied and they're starting up where they think they're going to be satisfied\n<$E> Well like I've said you've got also to look at the number of the youth who are actually in churches nowadays Well let's say we may have a small number of the youth in churches and then if they decide to get dissatisfied and break off into small groups You have to consider there are many other youth who are dropping actually from churches and going nowhere So you cannot say that on the overall the interest is increased but you can say that the interest has become more diversified for the people already in churches \n<$A> Makhoha what would you tell us about that \n<$C> I would not like to think that uh the youth are breaking away as such These break-away groups are led by people whom I believe are adults grown-up people who have their own interests in breaking up and that youth what the youth merely do is to join up these groups The youth don't actually break away If the youth break away at all it is because they are going to join up some already formed uh sect or some sort of religion or they are completely divorcing themselves from religion completely I would not like to think that the increase of sects and other such religious groups is the result of youth deferring from what the general trend is\n<$A> So you maintain that uh interest of the youth towards religion remains the same \n<$C> It does not remain the same I would like to think that in fact it is decreasing The youth are tending to go away very much from religion uh especially because you know to some of them religion looks very irrelevant and it does not offer any excitement you know it looks like it's some barrier to them enjoying life in quotes of course Yeah and I would like also to think that they will they want to go away from religion because it is a restrictive yeah it keeps them curbed be it Islam be it uh Christianity It stops them from doing things they really want to do They are like uh there's some church somewhere You are not allowed to have a girlfriend that would be a sin a thorough sin So in some way he sees now he is somewhere around eighteen twenty and he is he has got his sweetheart somewhere and he would like to move around with her freely and here is a pastor who is stopping him from doing that uh he makes a choice and the choice normally is not very much to the benefit of uh religion \n<$?> religion because we allow it\n<$A> Kamau what will you say to that\n<$B> Well I think I wouldn't quite agree with you on that point that uh Kenya you know in Kenya we're getting more and more denominations because actually Kenya has the largest number of religions or other denominations and the government has been quite reluctant on registering more groups So to me what is happening actually is that more people you know due to the explosion of the population people are getting excited and actually like what we are seeing in town It's not that new groups are coming In fact most of these groups I think are illegal according to the law because what happens that a person comes you know like the Saved People He comes and you know he makes his own group like these people who are meeting at Jeevanjee You know what happens you know confusion There is this at this corner this group at this corner not actually that these groups are registered anywhere It's just because people feel I think it's caused by the frustrations in life you know in our life with the increasing problems like unemployment You know the youth are really out there to look for places to keep themselves going And I think what's happening is not that people are getting more close to religion but what people want is something to keep them busy They're frustrated they don't have jobs in the streets you cannot keep on you know if you 're begging for food you can only afford to beg you know for few hours and then for the rest of the time you're bored and you don't have a job so you've got to keep on looking excited all the time\n<$A> Mkarasi what would you say to that\n<$D> Uh what I have to say is that okay I agree that in Kenya there is an explosion of religions that's coming up A real explosion because okay as Makhoha has put it our population is really increasing And especially the youth who really want something which can cater for our spiritual and material needs And we usually notice that the main churches really don't cater for both our spiritual and material needs at the same time So we find ourselves breaking out so that we find something at least a place where we can we can be accommodated spiritually and materially because if you join a sect which does not cater for your material needs I mean I just find that this is useless and that I just form their own church where I can collect some money and have a good life at least yeah So that's why we have such an explosion we want to find somewhere where we can flee to\n<$A> Absence of which will mean that you divorce yourself completely from religion\n<$D> At times\n<$A> Yes Nyongesa\n<$E> Yeah it could be at times at all Uh we what we are all pointing out is that the interest is decreasing\n<$A> is decreasing\n<$E> rather than\n<$A> Yeah maybe that maybe we should tackle that Uh do you think the youth now the number of youth in religion is it going down or is it going up for whatever reason whether I mean whether it is going up for any reason or coming down for any reason Is it going up or is it coming down \n<$F> decreasing \n<$A> It's decreasing for very many reasons \n<$F> Yeah very many \n<$A> Do you think promiscuity is a one of those reasons\n<$F> Yeah to an extent yes\n<$?> sexual promiscuity\n<$?> Yeah let's just say promiscuity\n<$A> Okay let's look at this other issue which I'm sure is really disturbing the minds of the youth Let's look at the cults uh something like devil worship is really you know is really eating through the minds of the youth Now there is a feeling you know that the increasing number of cults is also boosted by the number of youth who are falling out of church\n<$A> I mean what do you have to say to this Makhoha let's start with you\n<$C> Well about these cults What I feel is that you know people when they are looking at religion first in the first place we should take at what people look in religion You know is it to put themselves right to God you know when you look at the youth today it's not because they want to put themselves in right with God whatsoever it is These people are frustrated people They have nothing to do and loathe doing nothing So they just want to get to church and forget about the misery which is which they are living uh they are living in You see these cults they come about due to people who are hungry for money leadership what We found quite a number of them in town not to mention names and whatever You find that people who want to come up with their own cult They want to have their own uh codes of behaviour You know actually it deviates from the main the main line the Bible the way the Bible puts it You find that these cults they've got you know a distinctive kind of mode of whatever and they wouldn't actually tell you the rest You know each cult has its own way of doing things It's not because it's the way it's been put by the Bible It's just because people want to have a group they want to some people are hungry of leadership So they want to make a living out of this you know lack of things in the absence of jobs and such things So people actually they are they are looking for means to go about in life and that's how we're coming up with very many cults", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM',

{'text': "<$A> and if uh in any way this person transgressed or contravened the laws of the of uh of the society then uh all manner of unpleasant things would be following Now there were very strict moral codes there were very strict codes of behaviour that had to be adhered to and uh there is no way that anyone would rise up in society to any position of prestige if they did not conduct themselves if they did not conduct themselves in a way that was becoming and even beyond that if they died and uh uh one thing that will one thing that we'll mention uh as we go along is that there was a very uh great importance attached to the spirits of dead people or in African tradition that's the so called ancestor If one who was of poor conduct and then even after they had died uh they would be they would not be held in a position of esteem so that even uh their after-life would be viewed upon uh it would be viewed uh with uh \n<$B> you had a bad light\n<$A> yeah but by the people left behind\n<$B> by the people left behind\n<$A> you would not have a situation where there was a tradition saying if because your conduct was like this in life after death then you would go as the Christians would say or so the Judeo-Christian tradition has it one would go to hell or anything of this sort Was there anything of that sort of tradition\n<$B> No not as such because as we shall see later on people liked to come back into the world that they have been living to work out those problems that they've set into motion in their past lives but while we are still in this aspect of cause and effect where to place justice you all know very well that when the African child was born he was reminded continually both by precepts and by actions that he does not only belong to himself but he belongs to the whole community and therefore never ever should he ask his rights at the extent of the obligations or duties that he has towards the whole community and he was made to understand that whatever actions he set in motion will not only affect him but will also affect the rest of the community so much so that if someone had transgressed any of the laws of the community when they called in a diviner or a medicine man to come and exorcise him the whole community had also to undergo purification so that there will be no calamities to break down the community in which he was living you know to blacken the community in which he was living and as a result of that he was reminded continuously whatever he does if it is good it will bring out a lot a benefit for the whole community and if it's bad it will bring out a lot of calamities in the community such as plagues which are almost incurable devastating of farming because of drought and cyclones etcetera etcetera But this concept of cause and effect or due justice was not only confined to the social structure The African had also to relate with the natural environment in he lived in which he lived in For instance according to Zulus they said that it is only a silly bird that messes its nest meaning that if you destroy the natural environment in which you live in then of course you have messed the nest in which you are living And as a result of that the African was a great conserver or preserver of the of the natural environment He could not destroy trees or animals in the jungle unnecessarily\nFor instance as a psychological device he would be told that if you go around killing animals in the name of sport as a punishment from the god you'll die of starvation one day or if you run around destroying trees unnecessarily as a punishment from the gods you'll be struck down by lightning and as a result of that lose your life Now these may sound as facetious but these psychological devices helped the African to maintain the natural environment that they lived in the right state and therefore not causing imbalance in the environment Even they believed that wind transports our thought for instance they will tell you that if you think wrongly or if you curse someone your thought will be transported by the Southern wind to its target and if you want to bless someone then the thoughts of blessing will be transported by the wind or from the north to its targets or to its of course aim This indicating that he had not only to watch his actions physically but he had also to watch his thoughts and today we know that We are reminded by psychologists that there is a science of telepathy that your thoughts will find their way to the goal that you're aiming at so you have to watch your thoughts very very carefully That as you can see that the African knew that this law of cause and effect to produce justice was expected to help them to relate harmoniously with the social environment as well as the natural environment in which he lived in so he was a very very careful person He would never ask his rights at the expense of the obligation that he had toward the whole community\n<$A> Was this law expected or taken to be immutable in the sense that uh it had consequences respective what you did Once you did the you took the wrong step there would be reverberations from that wrong step If you took the right step there would be therefore the the requisite reverberations from the right step\n<$B> Yes and that is why all the time he was reminded of his obligations knowing that once the law had been set into motion there was no possibility of calling it back You had to go through the whole consequences and that's why I said the other role that it's not only that individuum who had to be exorcised or purified but the whole community had also to undergo the process of purification to ensure that there would be no calamities to overtaken the community to overtake the community and even the  offspring of that community\n<$?> \n<$A> So there was a very great emphasis on communality and responsible collective responsibility for the actions of everybody\n<$B> and everybody was very accountable for what he did\n<$A> It's not a question of I'm not my brother's keeper No I am my brother's keeper\n<$B> Yeah let's go on to the next of the basic concepts This is a question of Reba which a lot of Africans today think as very alien is a hocus-pocus\n<$A> Yeah uh this is a concept that is held on to my very many African communities and uh it is believed in many African communities that once you die you do not depart altogether that the real person is survives death so to speak uh The real person is said to be a spirit and after die and after death the spirit joins the other ancestor spirits and waits for some future time to come back most likely within the same family So there's a threat uh there's a strong feeling that spirits uh survive uh the physical death as we know it and waits for some future period to be to get reborn and uh\n<$?> uh\n<$A> that is illustrated even in the *namings>\n<$?> all the naming is that a \n<$?> an indication that this was the reason why you're naming somebody after somebody who was earlier born before\n<$?> Yes there is an expectation in many communities and uh that is why certain names uh are named that way uh very often after someone who had gone on uh before that so the expectation is that the new child that is coming into the family is a previous member reborn\n<$A> I want to tie this scene we're running out of time Rubin I want to tie this scene to life after death the concept of life after death in the African tradition uh what was the concept?\n<$?> Uh uh as a matter of fact just before we go to that we know for sure that for instance amongst the Yoruba of West Africa when a boy was born he was greeted as <ea/>babatunde that father has come back If it was a girl she was greeted as <ea/>Iantundi that's mother's come back And the Ghanaian would just greet a boy as <ea/>abadios that means he has come back and among the Luos of Kenya we are taught that in certain communities when the mother is expecting a baby a few weeks before the baby is born a certain spiritual entity in dreams approaches the mother and gives a certain name to the child and when the child is born if that child is not given that name the child develops queer characteristics like crying incessantly or contracting diseases which are almost incurable until when a diviner is called in to detect what ancestor was to be born and if the mother now gives the name as was suggested in the dream by that spiritual entity then the boy of course or the child assumes the right state of life as far as good health is concerned and good characteristics suggesting that that ancestor now had been recognised as having coming back Even among the Lamba of Zambia who are Bantus by their tradition I was once talking to a teacher who said that his wife who was a graduate six weeks before giving birth her grandmother had approached to her approached her in dream and the grandmother gave her a name which was female and when the child was born it was female its in its gender That as you can see this idea of reincarnation is not strange to the African culture and the most important aspect of it is that since we believed that our relatives come back to life there was no possibility of great *impoverty> Everybody was looked upon as a relative and therefore he could he had to be helped whatever state he may be in this world so it had to go he had this implication of cementing the social structure for helping each other as such as such Now coming to this concept of life after death the Isanusi say that is the wise ones say that man is composed of a physical body a soul and a spirit and when the physical body died the soul or Ibilozi hovered around the physical body for some time and then after that it went into a <ea/>isilueni A <ea/>isilueni is a place where <O/> or the soul assumed both human and animal state temporarily in an invisible state and then after some time the animal form was dissolved and the Ibilozi went into another place where it underwent a lot of rest and a sleep for quite a long time until this soul or Ibilozi dreamt of a certain service and knowledge which he had not acquired in the world Then the soul would awaken from that blissful sleep come to a <ea/>isilueni back in the physical body of a baby to get set in the mother's womb and help the birth of that child and develop that body and acquire certain knowledge and render service useful to mankind But you may ask this process of going in to the invisible world of the soul and coming out going to the physical world was it endless No after many births and deaths when Ibilozi or the soul had rendered all the services required and had acquired all the knowledge required in the world When it left the physical body for the last time it became absorbed in the universal spirit namely Itongo and therefore did not have to be born again in the world Thus as you can see life after death was not a source of terror because everybody knew that when he died he will still come back into the world to render more service and to acquire new knowledge", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$A> which we've been doing in secondary school is a completely different discipline Just for example for those who want to become doctors you must be good in mathematics chemistry physics biology Obviously you cannot be a doctor if you are not good in those subjects uh Then if uh you want to become a lawyer one thing you've got to be really bright indeed because uh the Law Faculty at the university uh takes only very few and because of that the point of entry uh the marks are rather high So that's why you need to score very high marks in order to get a place at the Law Faculty at uh your local university And then you don't need really to I cannot say you must be good in this subject or that but I think it will be appropriate to emphasise that that uh you should be very good in English uh good in geography good in history and uh and uh general knowledge So those are the subjects that you must really excel in \n<$B> \n<$A> But I have also examples in fact some of uh some of them are my good friends My very close friend we were once schooled together here in Nairobi and I went to do arts that's why I took English history and geography and religious knowledge and this friend of mine took mathematics chemistry and physics and he decided also to do law and is a very successful lawyer because law is complete different discipline as you go to university So you need to do well uh in all those subjects and then when you come to when you go to university you'll be introduced to a new discipline and it'll be very interesting for those of you who are interested and I'm sure you will not find it very difficult if you are really serious uh in concentrating on your work as I'm sure you are\n<$B> Do you have to be a person who likes to read a lot \n<$A> Oh in fact you've got to be a person who reads a lot because law involves a lot of reading\n<$B> yes \n<$A> Uh you cannot uh be a successful lawyer if you are lazy in reading\n<$B> There you are those of you who don't like your books You'd better start pulling up your socks Any more questions related to law as a career You know uh if you got any questions related to what you would like what kind of person you are supposed to be if you going to be a lawyer yes\n<$C> Your Lordship who should educate the people who should educate the people of their rights and privileges\n<$A> okay that is a bit off <O/> but it's okay\n<$B> No it's all right \n<$?> question\n<$A> Yes in fact this programme is part of an answer to your question so in fact the government is doing this through programme like this one So what we are doing here now we are talking to you and other members of the public who are watching this programme are also learning something about law I hope next time a doctor will come\n<$A> When you are at Muthaiga you are are pupils at Muthaiga Primary School?\n<$A> yes yes this is Muthaiga Primary School\n<$B> yes\n<$A> yes because I pass through it every morning You should know that yes uh because I give lifts to some of you every morning So you must know that uh your teachers will of course tell you what it entails to be this and that And then also through programmes of this nature you are also being told some of these uh uh things and uh then there's also careers uh masters who are in upper well secondary schools where you have careers masters who will explain to you exactly what you should do if you want to become a doctor or surveyor or engineer all right\n<$B> You had a very interesting question related to the character of a person who wants to be a lawyer What was the question\n<$D> Yes uh what character should you be Should you be a specific character to be a lawyer\n<$A> No It's not really a specific character to be lawyer but let me say that uh after you go and study at the university and you get your degree which is a LLB a Bachelor of Laws you will then that is after uh three years at the university you will then proceed to a Kenyan School of Law where you will be for twelve months and at the same time you'll be attached to a firm of lawyers will learn office practice and what lawyers do and then that's when you petition to become an advocate of the High Court Now uh to become an advocate of the High Court so that you can appear in law courts is not just any lawyer but it your character will have to be considered We want a person who is morally upright You see you can't uh law uh as they call themselves their learned friends and they want the legal profession to be special So that's why they ensure that as a lawyer you must be upright in your manners you must know how to dress uh as a lady yes and a lawyer that's why they always insist on being smart uh So because being learned and since you are going to be determining other people's issues obviously you must be above reproach because I can't see how you can say that well let me hear your dispute when your own life is disorganised you see So and all you are saying that you are going to determine disputes and uh you're calling yourself learned friend and you are dirty you don't uh you are not tidy uh you are drunkard they say uh that sort of thing uh you are rioting all over the place you don't sleep properly that's you see you've got to be a man who is disciplined and that's why we must uh uh emphasise this word discipline and it is easy for you because in school now you are disciplined because you know when you are supposed to come in in the morning and the bell rings you must go to this classroom at the end of forty minutes or forty-five minutes you change class or another teacher comes in and you know lunchtime is at such and such a time Lunchbreak is one hour or two hours you come back So this you can see these rules are in school and therefore you will not find it difficult It's only when you come out and you think that uh we want you to continue being disciplined and you feel that well we are we others who are harassing you We are not harassing you young people We are trying to take care of your future \n<$B> Yes so that means what you are going through in school now should be good training for those of you who want to be people of integrity and of standing in the law profession So it is something that you should take seriously from your teachers Yes do you have a question\n<$D> Your Majesty Why doesn't \n<$A> No no I'm not a judge \n<$B> Your Lordship\n<$D> Your Lordship\n<$A> Yes\n<$D> Why does a judge postpone a case to another day\n<$A> Why\n<$D> Why does a judge postpone a case to another day\n<$A> Yes because a judge is a human being cannot work throughout the night Now the position is this young man uh you see when you are hearing a case and uh witness keep uh are still being called at the end of the day you'll adjourn that case either the following day but you know if it is Saturday you cannot adjourn to Saturday you have to adjourn to Monday or some other day So it 's just because the uh the day has ended just like you in school After your last lesson you must go home isn't it The teacher does not keep you in school\n<$B> yeah \n<$A> So after games you must now go away isn't it yeah unless it's a boarding school so Muthaiga of course is not a boarding so at the end of the day you must go home so also a judge at the end of the day when he has been hearing a case he must adjourn it to another day But I think you want all you want to complain that a case comes and a judge does not even hear a single witness and he say that it is he has adjourned it to another day There must uh when there is a good reason uh for example a witness did not come or the lawyers involved have agreed that it should be put off for another day or there is a uh another serious case going on in which one of the lawyers in this particular case is involved then they adjourn for another day But I must tell you that there are so many cases pending in our courts in Magistrates Court in High Court in the Court of Appeal and so the judges cannot finish all the cases in a day \n<$B> Yes so uh we have noted reports of this the other element of people thinking that uh probably a lawyer's job is very easy that you just sit up there and listen to this side and the other side Then you bang the gavel when you are tired and you retire to the back and then come back and say oh this is for you and this is for you So maybe just tell them also emphasise upon them that probably the job is not as easy as it looks \n<$A> Now we see those of you now who'll uh I will explain how you qualify in order to go to university You have to study there for three years for your degree law and then you go to Kenya School of Law for twelve months then you become an advocate of the High Court then now it comes to question of employment I think we want to go that way \n<$B> yes \n<$A> Now after that what else would you do Not all lawyers can be judges because for example the in the country the law provides that the uh the the constitution and the judicature act that those are the rules that uh all the laws that uh guide the government in appointing judges The High Court judges are supposed to be only thirty-two So when the our parliament uh amends that to make it thirty-five or forty It used to be in fact nine I remember in the old days it used to be only nine only nine judges they changed to eleven they amended to fourteen they amended to seventeen to twenty-one to twenty-four Now it has been amended up to thirty-two Now but you cannot you should not expect from school to become a judge straight that would be strange because uh you must be a person who has uh lived among the people you know the problems of families and that sort of thing see that you are a mature person so when as a lawyer when you have qualified you can either become uh be employed the government as a state council You know that is government advocates working there in the chambers You'll be appearing on the behalf of the government either in the criminal cases when you are prosecuting or in civil cases when the government is a party to a suit That's one part Then you can also be employed in the local authorities like the Nairobi city commission You can become a town-clerk or you can work in the town-clerk's department as one of the lawyers because there is a lot of legal work going on there You can also work in the insurance companies You can also work in the banks You can also work in the co-operative movement because all these areas there are laws to be interpreted and they require a legal mind So it is not a question of just thinking of becoming an advocate and appearing in court There are so many lawyers who have never gone to court and they are doing very well", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source':

meaning that after the medical uh after the person has received medical attention uh if the best eye because there are two eyes uh he uh with a person if the best eye can only see at three metres what an average eye can see at sixty metres or the angle the vision at the widest angle is only twenty degrees or less then that person is called blind Before correction that person is not yet considered blind because there are many conditions uh that that might be causing that problem that could be corrected medically \n<$B> The Kenyan definition you said is functional and with a view at your definition that you have given is that now the universal position adopted globally\n<$A> Yes the Kenyan definition uh in the legal setting is functional but in the medical uh setting according to the National Prevention of Blindness Committee which is our national uh organ that uh oversees our whole ophthalmic programme we have adopted the WHO medical definition\n<$B> Doctor Gakuru any other additional point that may relate to the definition of blindness as a condition\n<$C> Uh Mr Chairman none at all except the fact that uh apart from that we also have what we call partially sighted which is the range between the patients who see with an with the best eye an object at six metres what a normal person will see at sixty and to the level that Mr Tororei had mentioned those are the group that are called partially sighted So we have the blind and the partially sighted and then those with uh normal vision \n<$B> Well could we now move to that causes of blindness condition Dr Gakuru What are the known causes of the problem?\n<$C> Yes Mr Chairman here in Kenya the order of frequency of the causes of blindness are by far the most cataracts Cataracts means uh opacity of the lens that is the lens within the eye This contributes about thirty-nine percent of all cases who are blind Now uh in the second place is trachoma Trachoma is a chronic infection of the eyes both eyes This contributes about sixteen percent of all the cases of blindness in our country and in the third place is glaucoma which contributes about fourteen percent of all the blind cases Glaucoma means raised intra-ocular pressures something almost similar to hypertension that we know in general medicine \n<$B> What would that mean in simple layman's language\n<$C> It means that the pressures within the eye there is a normal range and we have norm we have operators who are checking the pressures of the eye Now if it is raised beyond the normal range then we term that condition as glaucoma In the fourth place are other causes and amongst these causes are the most common trauma Measles and what is termed as zerophthalmia which is caused by Vitamin A deficiency and others These contribute about thirty-one percent of all blind cases in our country This order is different in other nations What I've given you is the order in our nation\n<$B> How about the distribution percent of the occurrence of the condition nation-wide and what will be the specific factors attributed to those situations\n<$C> Now the first cause is generalised within the whole country It's the same all over The second cause trachoma is found uh almost predominantly in the districts of Baringo Kajiado Narok and then sporadically in a few other areas Now the main denominator in these areas is that these are dry and dusty areas and the level of hygiene is very low so that the transmitter which are flies have the media to uh and the appropriate conditions through which they can transmit the bacteria from one person to the other because of poor hygiene\n<$B> Yes Are there things this would be open to any member of the panel that uh we would do as a family as a parent very early in early stage to identify uh the problems that may be affecting a child so that quickly Tororei would know that uh he has problems and needs attention\n<$A> Uh my reaction to that is yes there is If we see as a community or one of our friends having an abnormal eye in other words having like a red eye or a watery eye or a doctor would have medical terms for them if we send that person without delay to the nearest dispensary and this uh the health workers at that dispensary will in turn send that person to the eye specialist in our country our front-line workers uh professional eye workers are ophthalmic clinical officers and they are found in nearly all the districts in this country Now if a clinical officer cannot deal with that case then he will refer the cases to uh eye-surgeons and eye-surgeons are found in nearly all our provincial hospitals and a few major district hospitals and if in turn the condition is such that the eye the eye-surgeon uh in those centres cannot deal with then they would refer these to Kenyatta National Hospital for very advanced medical uh diagnosis and treatment So yes there is something we can do and the best thing to do is if you suspect your friend has an eye condition send him to the nearest dispensary and that way he'll get into our referral system \n<$B> Judy up to that level we have reached uh stages where we start to deal with the problem we are starting to manage blindness as a the condition and I'm interested at this level to see how the Kenya Society for the Blind comes in relation to your role as the assistant director \n<$D> One of the biggest challenges uh Kenya Society for the Blind is first thing in the nineteen nineties is to change the attitude and the attitudes of whom the attitudes of both the blind people and the sighted people In the past or even up to now we all know what stigma has been put on handicapped uh people And so how are we going to do this We hope to do this by creating awareness and through creating this awareness sending out positive messages we hope uh to change the attitude and in the process uh the blind people and the society are able to identify their problems and be helped\n<$B> What kind of uh specific channels that your society is using to create this desired awareness \n<$D> Uh there are many channels One of them is like this one where we are now I hope whoever is viewing is uh getting a message uh One of the other one is through the media messages through the newspaper messages through uh the TV the radio but that is just to the air people who have those facilities We hope to go further than that get into the rural areas physically uh talk to people and create this awareness We also hope to recruit people to be very close to us so that they can in turn do their job on our behalf because Kenya Society for the Blind programme we have just about a handful of people but once we've educated the public then they will carry out the job on our behalf We recruit them through membership on ordinary membership where somebody pays two hundred shillings uh per year and becomes a member We have what we call life membership where you pay two thousand Kenya shilling you become a life member We have what we call corporate membership where company and legal organisations pay ten thousand shilling every year and they become corporate member We also have people who are open just to give general donation realising that a charitable organisation and rely on this to carry out uh our activities So in that regard we'll use these people who will have joined us indirectly through this membership to be able to help us create the message\n<$B> Is the membership open to anybody\n<$D> The membership is open to anybody above the age of eighteen\n<$B> Yes Mrs Nyaga The role of education as it were is important in various aspects and it is probably more crucial to a person who is seen blind and presupposes that is uh some incapacitation of some sort Would you like to tell us how you are trying to solve this through education\n<$E> Yes thank you Mr Chairman Uh first of all I'll use the terminology that we use in the area of education When Dr Gakuru was talking she talked of hum those people who are blind and others who are partially sighted We like to use the terminology visually impaired This is where uh we include those who are totally blind according to the legal definition uh as was mentioned by Mr Tororei as well as those who have functional uh blindness and those who are partially sighted Now such children have been educated uh in Kenya most of the people in our country know of special schools and these are very few We have about seven special schools uh for the blind and of course they only take a limited number because of the boarding facilities Of late we have started another programme whereby we try to reach more children This is through integration and the integration is done either by putting the blind children together with the other sighted children either in boarding facilities of normal regular schools or even for publicity and for awareness we have what we call  itinerant education Well\n<$B> Which means what\n<$E> Now intinerant  itinerant system means uh one teacher specialist teacher helps or gives services to blind children in more than one school In other words you are not answerable to only one headmaster but you can give services to blind children or visually impaired children who are in neighbouring schools In other words you would take the education to the child instead of bringing the child to the education If a child is in Mombassa you don't have to take that child to Thika but you give the education in that area And this is done by using specialist teachers who are trained at KISE and also giving in-service courses to regular teachers and you give them the know-how to assist that blind child And blind children have been uh integrated or given education successfully from pre-school up to university And here I'm happy to say that in Kenya I think we have more blind uh people who have gone through education than any other of uh African countries in this region And uh what the Kenya Society for the Blind and the Sight Savers which is a sister organisation does We try to provide materials Now there is specific material that is required for the blind We hear of blind people writing in Braille And Braille is uh a kind of media whereby blind people are able to read with their fingers We have special machines for writing that and these machines have to be imported from overseas because they are not manufactured locally And they cost one Braille machine for example if somebody would like to donate one Braille machine for a needy case costs about three hundred and fifty pounds and it has to be imported either from UK or from USA And a simple equipment like the way you give a pen and a pencil and a piece of paper to your sighted child the simplest case kit you can use for a blind child would cost you about forty to sixty pounds and these are also available not locally but they have to be imported and Sight Savers helps the Kenya Society for the Blind as well as the Minister of Education because we work in conjunction in providing such kits to blind children all over Kenya At the moment we have about eleven districts which are involved with that  itinerant kind of teaching And mostly in remote areas like Wajiri Lodwar Samburu Mandera Narok Bungoma Baringo and in Nairobi alone we have about seventy children who are successfully integrated in fifteen schools

{'text': "<$A> we encourage such people wherever they are to form groups age-care groups self-help groups so that together with the other members of the community they can continue to remain active to do active work and we help them by initiating some age-care projects such as poultry keeping bee keeping bakery pottery work and many others Simple activities that they can do very well with little supervision from any expert and these other projects we have initiated and supported in various parts of the country and uh altogether there are about a hundred projects scattered all over the country and they are being managed by local organisations and churches that have the interest of the elderly people at heart And uh I can say that these projects are doing very well and they are uh meeting the income needs of the elderly people in the whole country\n<$B> All this of course requires some kind of financing How do you fund Help Age Kenya\n<$C> I think like what the chairman said at the beginning we depend entirely on some funds which we raise through schools through children and their parents through our officers who are employed by Help With Kenya and we also get assistance from the International Help Age which are doing the same work like us But mainly here in Kenya we raise fund by approaching schools and the schools with the children organise walks organise other activities where they're sponsored and the money they raise they give to the Help Age Kenya and Help Age Kenya gives to these projects which you have been told which are spread all over the country\n<$B> How much What sort of expenditure would you have a year on average\n<$C> I think we spend more than\n<$A> about nine million shillings\n<$C> nine million shillings and it's all scattered all over the country to these needy people\n<$B> How many are you affecting directly and indirectly\n<$A> Uh as I said uh in a project you will find of uh about fifty uh participants who were elderly average of fifty so if we have supported a hundred projects you can see the number of elderly people\n<$B> You are talking about five thousand people You were talking about two million you said roughly Kenya's twenty-four million insured people \n<$A> Yes\n<$B>: being sixty years and older What's happening to the rest of the sixty million Even if it's not all of them who are not in a position to help themselves\n<$C> Like what has been said most of the money we're saving in health or in need of material so we are not helping all those which are elderly people over sixty in our population We are helping those who are found to need help like what I've said earlier I am almost the same age but I don't come to help even other people who are over sixty-eight as they may be able to look after themselves But we select those who are really needy and there are sometimes sick like a gentleman I treated a few months ago and they need help they need food they need clothes They may need eyeglasses They may need many things which they don't have and that's why we are coming so that they do not look after them all with provision of age of people in Kenya We look after those who need help and who have come perhaps sometime to seek for it They are found and they are brought together in day-care centres uh in homes and then we get in touch with them that way\n<$A> That is the question you asked is very good It's key to why we have now uh a day which has been designated uh as the day for the elderly for the aged because Help Age uh Help Age International and the United Nations know that there is a  world wide problem The people who need help because they've been incapacitated by age are many all over the world you take Kenya you take Tanzania our neighbouring countries you take India there are millions and millions and millions\n<$B> How many therefore \n<$A> And therefore I couldn't tell you the figure in the world uh certainly there are more in the developing countries that uh than there are in the developed countries but the problem is there and therefore the United Nations hopes that on the first of October which is the day that has been designated as the elderly day is really for people to uh stir themselves up both in minds and also economically and say now this is our problem Everybody should feel that way this is our problem and nobody is going to solve this except us We must do the best we can We must do the most we can We have to educate one another we have to educate the children and to educate the teachers or to educate the parents or to educate those who are working and are married or not married and so on It is a national problem We know all that the government is doing what it can We know that the missionary organisations and other organisations are doing what they can but the problem is still big So if we can realise the importance of this day first of October as a day of trying to enter and penetrate the minds and the hearts of as many people as possible we shall have achieved the purpose\n<$B> What specifically are you going to do on that day\n<$C> Uh on that day uh we have uh alerted all the aged-care projects we have supported to show concrete concern for the elderly people wherever they are by visiting them by talking to them and by finding out from them whether something could be done to make life more uh enjoyable Here in Nairobi we will visit some of the old people's homes and we have organised uh for schoolchildren to visit some of these homes and to talk to the old people entertain them if they have a some good songs to sing to them and uh the old people will also enjoy being with them and at the same time uh will sing for the young people because it's not just the young people entertaining the elderly people We have seen cases where elderly people also enjoy being with young people and uh they entertain them They tell them what used to happen a long time ago and in this way uh other people will be more aware of the problems of the elderly people\n<$C> Mr Chairman It is you were saying this a national problem and we as an organisation voluntary organisation we realise what we are doing with the Ministry of Cultural and Social Services and in the rural areas and all over the country where we are operating we have projects we also involve the administration and the people in charge of the cultural and social services there so that they do see what is happening is right and the funds we send to those projects are used properly so we are connected with the administration and the government and the Minister of Cultural and Social Services to work and to carry on and to reach the people the right people and to see that the funds we raise and which are donated are properly used in the parts we we send\n<$B> Does the ministry have uh specialised people involved in all these problems\n<$C> I think the Ministry of Social uh cultural and Social Services they have people who are experienced with all the social problems affecting the community and this is one of the few they must have people We have somebody who comes to represent the ministry in our organisation in order to move things on the board and in the district committee <O/>\n<$B> Uh apart from the Ministry of Culture is there a sort of collective or coherent approach between yourselves the churches other people plus the Ministry of Culture or whichever ministry or department is involved with old age problems\n<$A> Well at this stage I would say that there is something that is uh coherent plus co-ordinated and so on because uh people work voluntarily and uh we will uh I think gradually reach that stage but at the moment uh some organisations have gone further than others but we shall have to come to that so that we will not repeat the same projects or do not have the same places visited several times and so on But however we will have to bear in mind that some of these projects are run by local authorities others by missionary organisations and we in ourselves uh by ourselves we depend very much on these volunteers on these people who are uh working and are missionary organisations or in missionary organisations people who are local authorities areas where the Ministry of Culture and Social Services supporting Help Age Kenya main participation at the moment is funding Funding in the sense of building uh providing funds for supply of needed items blankets sheets or uh roofs uh water pumps uh We buy goats we buy chicken for them to bring up to rear and this what we call income-generating uh uh projects We don't have institutions which are clearly run and daily supervised by Help Age Kenya We do have people who go around to have a look at what is happening in those institutions so to bring us report if there is money required for further development diversification new projects somewhere We have to have people who do that but otherwise uh the missionary organisations and the local authorities uh they try their best and we welcome applications as much as our funds will allow uh for development or for starting new projects I think one idea uh item that we have not mentioned yet is a question of these day centres and I think at this stage I would like uh the executive officer Mr Were to tell us a little more or to tell the audience a little more about these day centres\n<$B> What are these day centres\n<$D> Uh first of all we emphasise that Help Age Kenya would like to see the elderly people supported within the extended family system that is within their homes \n<$B> That is the ideal situation \n<$D>: not by taking them to old people's homes So in order to help them within their community we are encouraging the establishment of uh day centres where the elderly can go during the day and uh uh\n<$B> be looked after\n<$D> be looked after and they can also be involved in some light activities uh also they can entertain themselves They can tell stories what they used to see long time ago The young people can come to visit them Schoolchildren could even come to learn from them how to look traditional traditions and so forth\n<$B>: We are running out of time Just one more question here uh we seemed to be indicating that the problem of the aged particularly affects those whose families have become educated and left gone away to the towns other towns etcetera Is this a problem among say those who have grown old and have been well educated They have been properly educated Their children have their children taken care of them <O/> You are quite elderly yourself You have been in public life that many years What is your personal experience of it and also looking at your close friends and colleagues \n<$?> Mr Nyaga perhaps\n<$B> Uh is this a problem that's also start could start affecting even those of us who thought Well you know we've taken care of our children we are quite literate and if something happens they're going to take care of us\n<$A> Well first if you look at the so-called developed countries That was the beginning of this kind of problem In that through urbanisation industrialisation people moving away from their countryside and into these areas they found that they found it difficult sometimes very expensive timewise or moneywise to be visiting people if you are employed a hundred miles away two hundred miles away sometimes in different countries altogether from Britain you're employed in Australia All that you have to do is to wish that there was a home where you can pack off your father pack off your mother pay a certain fee and forget about them and say well those people do their best there", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL',

{'text': "<$A> and income say for example a person who has a suffering child and this person uh needs to take care of this child so the only option and the easy option out to cater for this child and for  ourselves is probably to engage in uh this kind of a behaviour \n<$B> I think we what you are basically trying to focus at is that we are narrowing down to the problem of malsocialisation It's as a result of the improper socialisation that the society is imparting to the young generation that is leading to the extreme case of deviance among the youth which ran up to adulthood because this youth actually once they become deviants they at one point in time they'll become adults and you know the circle continues So you are saying that in the traditional African setting the family the whole family was looked upon not just the nuclear family but the extended family was looked upon as a socialisation mechanism through which the young children were taught the norms of their society and everything that goes to good behaviour \n<$C> Okay I'd like to ask Musalia what he really meant by prostitution being an economic uh an economic kind of way of looking for money because prostitution is not only for women but for men I don't know what he has to say about that when it comes to deviance \n<$A> Well you have just added another dimension which maybe will come up maybe later in the programme but as you realise that somebody doesn't engage herself or himself for that matter to add in that dimension out of I mean for the pleasure of it I mean that's not something pleasurable so it is definitely the economics the economic gain out of that that leads somebody the economic difficulties that lead somebody into engaging into such kind of a behaviour \n<$D> Well I don't know because she is raising an issue of the issue of men in prostitution and we say that for example well people have always said that uh when they look at prostitution most people in fact think of women but she's telling us that men can also be prostitutes \n<$A> Maybe she could come up and say how the men come into prostitution \n<$D> Because I think it's important so because prostitution if to look at it in a proper perspective it needs if we are speaking about maybe from the sexual perspective it needs two people to make prostitution\n<$?> It's two-way\n<$A> Exactly \n<$D> you can't say that uh there's prostitution if it's only uh men who are involved or women who are involved So I think we should look at this issue more closely \n<$C> I think what I would say also is prostitution when it comes to men there are young men who go out with older women and also they are looking for money it's not really the pleasure in it Even if it is they also want money so when it comes to prostitution I think the society should not just look at women they should also think about the men although the women are more into it than the men \n<$B> So basically we are all agreeing that that even prostitution is as a result of the financial constraints that the family's facing Just as Mr Musalia's put it it is the economic part of it that mostly is leading to the rise of deviance in the society You know if you looked at it at the family level once a family economically is not viable it results into poverty It's this poverty that propels the youths on the onto the streets or onto doing other sort of crimes or prostitution and such like cases \n<$D> Well I don't know wherewith because Musalia you are the one who raised the issue of economics in prostitution but uh I would be hesitant to look at it from the purely economic of course I don't underrate the impact of economics but I would be hesitant to look at it from the purely economic point of view in the view in view of the fact that for example you find that there are children people who end up in crime and you look at them you look at their biographies and you find they are people who have come from relatively well-off There are in fact sometimes you find somebody in prostitution they are very comfortable so that the next question is you raise is why is this happening \n<$B> Perhaps that could be attributed to outside influence you know because basically if you looked at our societies more critically prostitution was not even a thing that was in existence nor was crime but it's a as a result of what I would say more western influence Perhaps they derive pleasure in doing what they are doing I would take it like that \n<$A> Well if you look closely well you see this pleasure it could be a means to an end I mean you use it to get something else though I can't rule out the fact of uh somebody maybe it could be a hobby I mean though that's a very crude way of saying it But we can't rule out that particular aspect but I would believe that the overriding factor I mean in the majority of cases the economics uh surpass all the others \n<$D> Well I the economic part of it not withstanding I think the for example you these uh the question of personal morality for example the kind of because you see that's how I would maybe want to because if we keep on saying that deviance stems from society I think we are for burdening the society I think there is well what I wanted to ask is whether in fact there's an element of individual responsibility in some of the things that we do for example \n<$B> Yeah What you are looking at is the moral constraint on the on the individual Basically you know an individual doesn't stay in a vacuum sort of what he would like to do is something that he thinks should impress others but I don't look I don't see how then prostitution if he does it unless it's part of a group it's an influence he's got from a group so that if he does something the group you know looks at it in esteem it's something worth looking up at But for this case I don't know whether actually it's something worth being done \n<$C> I think also the individual has not so much to be blamed because of deviance because like when you're brought up in a family and you're told these are what you are supposed to be following these are the rules and then you wonder why you are told not to do what you're not supposed to do and then you'd like to find out why you are not being told not to do what you want to do and I think in a way that brings people to deviate from the ways \n<$A> Anyway essentially I think what we are talking about is uh the extent to which also uh the moral decadence of the community has decayed Because one thing I'm trying to see is that I'm trying to look at is that uh you see there's traditional norms I mean the people who are in uh who are bringing I mean who are the custodians of those particular norms who are mostly the elder and they would always reprimand their children uh not to engage in some such kind of a thing And there was a morally accepted and prescribed ways to deal with deviance So that particular centre that used to hold uh due to the changing uh circumstances in our society uh no longer holds And that is the basis of these particular uh uh problems you are talking about of deviance Because if it was still in place then I would believe that deviance would be at its minimum \n<$B> Yah in fact what you are saying actually is very right because we've all known that the agents of imparting socialisation to children are no longer the same as it was the case before So partially now that children are more socialised in schools among their peer group more often than they are socialised by their grandmothers and grandfathers That could be the end result of poor socialisation\n<$D> Well I think we should now go into the issue you raised the issue of the traditional custodians and you are saying that they are not anymore So the something has happened in our society which has made that which has made that now the guardians the checks the balances we had in our set-ups are no longer working So we should focus maybe on this issue and try to see what has happened Well I think at one point we can say that broadly speaking the issue of westernization and uh the coming in of western culture through various media you find that this has had a very big impact for example when you speak about school School is a positive institution but it can also be \n<$?> negative\n<$D> a very negative institution \n<$?> Yes\n<$D> because it depends on the kind of even what is taught even legitimately taught in the in the school can be a source of can lead to defiance deviance because you see for example the kind the of education which is drawn from western liberalism and the emphasis on the individual which means that it tends to alienate the educated individual from the from the collective So that eventually he ends up on his own And I think that kind of education is quite possible one of the reasons that lead to problems like uh drugs for example you suddenly find yourself alone well-educated all right and comfortable but with a vacuum which in our in our <O/> system would have been filled by maybe relatives in-laws <O/> all these extended uh kinship systems But suddenly you find that through your education you have been alienated you have been alienated you can't anymore interact with the with them And you find at this point you have to fill it in some in some way You find a lot of drug abuse and of course drugs we don't necessarily mean that the hard ones like cocaine and things like that Even smoking can become uh is in fact\n<$B> Even alcohol \n<$D> is in fact a form of drug abuse even alcohol So you find a lot of people going into these engagements these preoccupations so that they can fill a void which uh which they may not be able to explain \n<$A> Yah You are right Mr Goro In that particular sense of looking at it in terms of education as a *contributant> factor as a contributing factor to deviance I would agree with it because one thing education uh as you have said is modelled on some foreigner system I mean the Africans used to have uh their own education system whereby the boys after in uh circumcision they would be uh taken to some seclusion and they'd be taught all about their society Uh The ladies uh the same way when they go sleeping uh at uh in their uh at night they would be with their grandmother \nWhatever was going on was looked at as more or less law that if you and of course it was law anyway that if one was to become pregnant or to uh to go I mean to circumvent some law then he'll be liable to some uh punishment But education per se has revolutionalized the thinking of many I mean who have gone to class And that revolutionalizing of the mind has brought about this deviance So that now a person is not ready to sit with his father to sit with her mother and to draw the uh the advice from her and that one has tended actually to alienate us from that source that used to give us that particular advice \n<$B> Yah basically that should be very right because individualism has been more a result of westernization which of course implicitly education is part of the westernization process so that here we find the more an individual gets educated or learned if I could use them simultaneously the more he or she is alienated from the family", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$A> So there's no trust any more Then there's no personal commitment The only commitment left is the so-called constraint commitment You are constrained because you have children You don't want to leave each other because children will suffer You have property some time together you have friends and social pressure You want your friend to know you are a family man or you have a family like anybody else But actually you don't have marriage The I know cases whereby people even write me letters for our publications and they say they don't talk to each other they talk through the medium of their child you know the child is the medium\n<$B> Doctor Kabithe much as I would want to differ or much as I would want to agree with you that we would hate to be static uh that we have to change with the time changing times But I feel that we would shift blame more on you know the changing times They've made us really try to do what we didn't know ourselves doing For instance we want to live how Whites live We want to live in a civilised way such that you find that most of these killings or most of these other things you blame them on way of change uh a parent would kill a kid because uh they say he's not able to bring it up adequately or according to the standards then Don't you think then actually this changing or the way that we have adopted our style of living has more to blame when it comes to all these kind of family breakages child abuse and all that kind of thing\n<$A> This is a very interesting Miss Kinuthia because I <slang/>wonna make a point here perhaps you never heard before I've lived in a western countries for more than seventeen years And may I tell you this Some of the things you see us doing believing that that's what westerners do is not true For example my son is there and he talked to me the other day And he told me it is very interesting that when he went to that college in the United States he was surprised By midnight nobody is out You cannot even go in the door in the girls' dorm You are in the men's dorm If you go to girls' dorm you can only stay in the uh lobby You can never go upstairs in their rooms Yet here in our universities ladies can go to the boys' room boys can go to the ladies' room and we want to believe that is western It is not western It is misunderstood western\n<$C> So are we less responsible \n<$B> Where did we get it from\n<$A> Well well here's a point It's actually the question of the ignorance whereby you totally did not understand what you thought you understood Africans think they understood Europeans but they didn't Europeans have a culture They have self-discipline There are a few of them who are actually uh misfit and we may be copying those but a basic family over there it is not what some of us believe\n<$D> Doctor I like to take you now to the health degree Now you talked about break-up uh and uh I don't know whether maybe you should tell us what to what extent there are the safety valves as it were you said psychological uh psychologically reach a barrier uh what about drugs do you have a problem is is this a problem is this a way out Is it becoming a way out for this society dangerous as it is\n<$A> Yes Drug is serious More serious than most people think Let me give you uh another interesting situation Nairobi is being referred to as a suburb of London as far as heroin addiction is concerned having gross addiction Gross addiction is when you are addicted to alcohol you are addicted to drugs hard drugs you're addicted to everything And most addicts actually start small with a <ea/>bhangi They go to cocaine Pretty soon you know they graduate And most of them actually even regular alcohol is no longer good <ea/>chang'aa you know kill-me-quick-type is what they go for And then of course the heroin roll in I am seeing very many of young people and some of the parents of these people are very frustrated people Some of the wealthy people are sending their children to London\n<$D> You mean Kenyans\n<$A> Yes Kenyans for treatment and it's a very expensive centre okay now I have seen rehabilitation centres that have been actually using <O/> which are cheaper But these are initiated by society by citizen who care parents we the professionals and uh those are the kind of thing I would hope that Kenyans who are really concerned can get together and start These are residential centres whereby there's no drug coming in and one's understanding of why he got into it and so forth is done Let me also mention this I have met a lot of students who got addicted in India And I asked them to give me a comparison of the addiction and the Indian student addiction and they told me something interesting is that for every five addicted students in some of these universities you find one in five are Kenyans or Africans and one is an Indian and the drug is in India So I asked them What do you think about that They think the Indians understand the danger of drug more than Africans so Africans are very vulnerable victims\n<$E> Doctor Kabithe uh can you if you go back a bit we're talking about psychologically divorces or legal divorces and talk about drugs How do you link up with the level of aggressiveness in our society today\n<$A> Well uh perhaps let's put this way if you want to know if a young man or a man is addicted to heroin uh an average addict would require more than one thousand shilling some could get two thousand per day to actually just feed the habit He has not even counted his eating or where to sleep Well to raise that kind of money he would just resort to crime So if you want to talk about relationship between drug addiction and crime there it is because he can only sleep when he's high when he get up he's busy trying to freak out And these people cannot work Working bring money too slowly He cannot wait for \n<$D> I think Doctor Michael was also talking about just the general aggressiveness now in Kenyan society They want to get this they want to get that you know the <ea/>matatus and everybody bang into each other nobody really caring at all I mean uh even they even the well-off people I mean some of the some of the crimes as you say are really you hear a businessman has committed a robbery You know a businessman is supposed to be doing business not robbing not robbing banks Now there's a lot of aggressiveness It was not so before I agree with you In fact before if somebody died on the street you you'd uh stopped to look at who is dead but now I don't think if I drop dead on the street nobody would even care not even look back uh What's happening\n<$A> It's called frustration chief \n<$?> \n<$A> Okay We are stressed frustrated full of anxiety and we don't know what to do Therefore we are just acting It's like if you put a bunch of animals in a room and you set it on fire watch their behaviour It's unpredictable it look illogical And human beings are no better If they do not understand how to go about it that's what I'm suggesting we got to believe in developing skill People are very frustrated actually And as I said some think money is and so forth well it's not unusual Let me tell you uh a funny story whereby a very wealthy man a multi-billionaire in America who was caught stealing a newspaper because it was too time-consuming to pay for it <$A> He decided to steal it and he was in the court It's rather funny Now you told me some businessmen stealing Now what you'd be very surprised that some of these businessmen some of these wealthy people will never live to enjoy their wealth All right And most of them by the time they hit seventy or sixty will be suffering from hypertension and they'll be dying of the so called short illness \n<$?> Now I said self-understanding is very important and I would say for many of us let's try to understand ourselves How can we be moderate Criteria of success has been actually misunderstood in our continent or in our country We really believe a person is respectable if he has a lot of money regardless how he's obtained the money Now if I wish we were saying a person should be respectable depending on how he obtains the money because our young people now are having role models They want money so that value of hard work is going away You see we have a problem here Now where do we start motivating young people to have better families to have better life than ourselves\n<$A> Now the same professors or lecturers have a lot of family problems because of money spent on drinking Now where do you actually have social models in our country That is the problem\n<$?> What about politicians are they models to other people\n<$A> Let's put this way we are talking about corruption there's no secret and so forth and that's why I said what I would suggest is we should go back to the basics We want now to begin respecting people on the basis of how they made their money not how much money they have\n<$C> Going back to the family set-up uh if I can take you back to that surely not everybody takes drugs or not everybody drinks but you still find uh strained relations in almost every social relationship My poser to you is Would you rather these people stayed together with uh such strained relations or they stay apart\n<$A> That's a big question In other words Is it better to divorce or to separate if you're not getting along or is it better to stay there \n<$C> Yeah \n<$A> under stress\n<$C> Yeah because I don't see why we should be too close physically yet too far emotionally\n<$A> In other words you don't see the use of living in psychological divorce\n<$C> No\n<$A> uh you know when I got to the United States the first man I met was a minister who was divorcing Church minister He was called Victor <O/> I had visited him he had invited me and he told me uh Mr Kabithe at that time I was just a student I am divorcing my wife and I are divorcing I told him do you know the worst thing you can do is to divorce He asked me why It is bad for children and so forth He told me maybe the best thing I can do for my children is to give them a chance to see their mother happy or me happy one day But if they continue to see us angry at each other I'm not even developing their personality properly I feel guilty I feel irresponsible and I think they are better off without me or maybe without mother so that they can see a happy parent even if it is one parent I think that answers your question Now today as a when I look back I feel that man was right Now of course you remember this We are called a developing country Before we are called developing country we are called we were called what underdeveloped country do you remember\n<$C> Yeah \n<$A> They changed it Most of us think\n<$D> Then they changed it

Kinuthia\n<$C> Good evening viewers\n<$A> Father Kinuthia is from the Holy Family Cathedral On the extreme right is Mr Chege Kiruli\n<$D> Hello viewers\n<$A> He is a lawyer by profession and he'll give us the professional perspective or point of view and lastly but not least as always in the programme is Professor Gatere who needs no introduction \n<$E> Good evening viewers Now as usual on our programme we have been looking at social typical social issues that uh have a capacity to generate stress in all of us Tonight we are going to address the issue of divorce an extremely important issue in our current uh society in Kenya and we are more than it's usual because we want to hear a wider range of views on this very important topic divorce\n<$A> And uh if I may take the liberty of asking our learned friends we're all here of learned friends so that the bonus is really only on the extreme right and fortunately not ladies and then gentlemen to give us the definition from the legal point of view What is divorce\n<$E> Divorce in legal terms is the judicial process that terminates marriage One here has to presuppose that there is a legal marriage before any judicial process is put into motion to terminate or nullify such marriage There are various grounds that one can use to put the judicial process into motion The main grounds are adultery cruelty and desertion Those are the main ones The petitioner that is the person or the party going to court has to prove those grounds to the satisfaction of the court I do not normally want to go into details on these grounds\n<$A> Maybe the ball is really on anyone's court If we look at adultery from your perspective what might be the definition of adultery that could contribute\n<$B> Thank you Mr Chairman I think uh if there is anything that is painful in any marriage it's unfaithfulness Uh to the viewers I 'm sure they have found a lot of homes breaking and not from because of the poverty there is in their home but because of the unfaithfulness and all  that I can say about it is that uh although it is clear to those who are not Christians and even the hiding Christians people can sit and talk about it and solve it and uh make a marriage live continue\n<$A> Do you have anything to add to this \n<$C> Well I could say this that hum when you talk of not only of grounds of adultery but even others maybe it's also very well to look at this question from another point of view Now we have had a word to divorces from the legal point of view but as well there is the question of there are some marriages which can be made invalid that is they were never really marriages Maybe we don't talk much of that but if it's there there's a real problem in which case we are not talking of divorce but  annulment of a marriage for example when you have such problems like impotence insanity Maybe there is somebody under-age a child who is being married or blood relationships which of course will affect this marriage such that a marriage cannot take place Now those are marriages which we do not say really they are being divorced although in active uh although actually they are being divorced but we say that they are being nullified because they were never there When it comes now to something like adultery it's when now the church says and talks of separation Separation and there are two kinds of separations we talk of in the Church Separation where you don't dissolve the bond of marriage in which case you give time time for repentance time to reconcile time to rethink again because the bond of marriage is not actually being rent asunder cut uh but rather we are talking of the possibility of coming back Even when we talk in terms of adultery and so on you have to think also in terms of religious welfare and God forgives and that we should also forgive I'm not saying that you know adultery therefore is to be accepted or other crimes and sins That's not what I'm saying but I'm saying to give the possibility of understanding the possibility of reconciliation forgiveness So the other part then is that a separation now where the bond of marriage is totally dissolved and this is where now we are talking of  annulment of marriages due to certain things objections which make it that the marriage was never really there at the beginning I hope maybe I've touched on what you're asking especially about\n<$A> Now Dr Gatere on the still looking on the grounds of divorce our learned friends mentioned cruelty but to me as a layman I can decide to be happy but to you that definition is being cruel I may like loud music but to your ears I'm being cruel If we are in marriage with somebody can that be used as maybe one of the grounds or what is really cruelty\n<$E> Cruelty is extremely difficult to define objectively It is a very subjective matter and it is the sufferer who knows where the shoe uh it is the shoe wearer who knows where it pinches Many people uh consider that say physical cruelty such as physical beating uh is isn't so terrible We happen to know people who enjoy it Now what would you say in a situation like that There are people who culturally tend to speak very rudely and their interaction inter-personal interaction uh takes the form of the type of form that you'll be shocked according to your culture uh the way they in fact that is that is how they communicate so that uh any an observer from outside would think that this is terrible and this is very very cruel but to them it is not coming over like that so I think cruelty is uh something that has to be seen first and foremost from the point of view of the sufferer That's very important uh Secondly uh from considering the circumstances surrounding what is being perceived as cruelty The perception of the person is very important the real person and that is what really must be tested and it may require more in uh proving cruelty than just uh objective stated uh positions It may require for example psychological elucidation of the position for the person may be perceiving things totally different from what most people perceive it and uh they therefore exaggerate them or put them in terms that are going to be very difficult but I agree that when all is said and done cruelty clearly must be considered as a proper uh ground for separation because some people are just too cruel to their spouses\n<$A> Now going back to Mr Kiruli Desertion is one other strong ground that you gave Even though interesting enough you uh initially just to as uh you know getting back to what you mentioned before you talked of strong grounds but before you touch on how easy or how it isn't easy to get divorce just looking at the other point that you had mentioned of desertion Is it necessarily physical desertion or can I desert you yet I'm physically present What exactly do you mean\n<$D> Desertion can be physical and it can also be uh mental You can live together in one house and not be together In that I mean where you have two people staying in one house and yet one lives as if he's alone or the wife lives as if she's alone That means that there is no interaction between these two people There could be constructive desertion that occurs when you appear as if you're staying together but indeed you are not or the desertion can also be physical whereby you move out of the house and you stay away from the home for a year or more What I should emphasise here is that uh it's not as easy as that when you come to court You have to prove that uh the other spouse has deserted you That means that the if the spouse as the man or husband has failed absolutely to provide uh as a normal husband would provide for the wife That is desertion When we come to the adultery or cruelty or agree with the father here that the in-law we have divorces that have to be proved from the point of view that there was a legal marriage from the beginning We have instances where there was no marriage from the beginning That is to say where the legal requirements were not fulfilled during the ceremony of marriage For example if you went to church at night uh you closed your doors to the church and you conducted a marriage That marriage is not legal marriage It's *annullity> from the beginning Or whereby you have two persons who are too close in terms of the degree of uh consanguinity where a brother marries a sister or a father marries a daughter That marriage is *annullitive> from the beginning or where you have uh an underaged getting married without a consent of the father That marriage is *annullitive> from the beginning what you call void agnitia in law The cruelty cannot be defined It could be mental and it could be physical Mental cannot also be defined It ranges from queer habits that the other spouse cannot tolerate to mental cruelty in terms of actions done by the other party to annoy to the extent that the other person cannot tolerate that annoyance It could also be physical where somebody comes in and beats the other frequently to the extent that uh that person cannot live with the other When it comes to the actual cases in court proof is required and the degree of proof is high The court will not allow a divorce just because one party wants a divorce The legal practitioner also before taking action we have to be uh to be satisfied that there are good grounds to move to court otherwise you'll not proceed to file the petition simply because the implications on divorce are great The area of uh children is something that one has to take into account when one is contemplating filing a divorce There are various issues that are required before this is done Mr Chairman I don't know whether you want to be specific here\n<$A> No that's quite fine \n<$B> I just want to say excuse me something small to what our learned friend has said about the cruelty both the physical and mental I think the result of uh uh one being cruel to one another is because there is no dialogue in that place mostly commonly found But uh if a man comes home and starts beating a wife surely he has not just started beating her there just total beating her there it was a plan and that might have been in the pipeline for quite a while and the only way I feel to solve some cruelty in forms or in marriages is communication If two people are staying together and most of the times they are nil by mouth for sure they are not talking to one another there are bound to be some *confliction> of a kind And so to solve them to solve the cruelty to solve the beating to solve that silence in the home I think it's good to talk and come to the conclusion or agree to disagree if the need be but at least there should be a dialogue\n<$A> I would agree with you uh Normally that's what the uh legal does uh practitioner does", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '358bb09b-4820-4bd5-a356-5a24c299afc8', 'added':

{'text': "<$A> And what does the law say against about such abuses violence against women\n<$B> Uh the law position the position in law is that in every violence case may it be defilement to a child may it be rape the one who has been offended the culprit you know the victim is the one to prove the case And that's what I'd tried to say here that for a blind woman it's difficult You see you have to go and report to the police you have to go and have a medical check-up you have to go it is you expected to do all these things yet it's the very very you who has been traumatised And most often than not the blind woman will not be able to follow all these you know bureaucracies and so our cases are hardly reported even when we have been violated \n<$E> I think I should add on that when it comes to the crucial you know part of identifying the person What are you know how are you supposed to identify the you know the uh you know person who has committed the uh crime You are supposed to identify the person you know so you have to use your visual and maybe you have to identify the voice she has talked of changing the voice and now what is left is what you have to identify using your eyes and when now the sight is not there then your case is just gone Even if you have all gone through all that problems of going to report to the police medical check-up and all that but you are not able to identify the person you know it is really frustrating and instead of going through all that hassle many decide just to shy off\n<$E> And in fact I'd comment on that Uh one might even decide not even to talk so how do you identify the voice He may just have decided to abuse her and then off he goes So you wouldn't really even have that time to talk I mean that he'll talk and you'll maybe recall his voice \n<$C> Are you sometimes forced to use the sense of uh smell to identify people or things\n<$B> Well I think that that's not uh really to the effect of criminal cases like now when it comes to violence against the woman The issue here is that when that offence has been committed if you can't identify using your sight there is always the aspect of having witnesses you know corroborators who'd be able to strengthen your case for that matter but the fact I'm again trying to hammer is that when you're blind even the witnesses you would say you'd have access to you didn't see them around the incident so you'd not even have any witnesses So your case would just be thrown out And that's the point we are trying to put here that We want the public to be aware that we are very vulnerable and we hate being taken advantage of and I'm using that word being taken advantage of because people have *capitualised> on this for a very long time And in some cases it doesn't even have to be rape that it's lack of consent by force sexual offences would be even by misrepresentation you know and because the society have always rejected us if not rejected us you'll find our women grow up even without knowing what are the real essence of sex such that they are abused they know it is sex but they don't know what it will tantamount to such that you find some of us be end up being single parents not that they want it because you see when you are dumped at home you are not exposed to many of these things So those who see you say oh that that take advantage of your purity and you end up having a child because the man knows what he is doing and the woman maybe you really don't you are just naive You see it's sight that will expose you to reading materials to seeing what people do copying how they walk how they talk but when you are blind and you are just dumped there you really become naive \n<$E> Yeah Loise we continue we hear the many problems which are faced by the blind people and in this case the blind women and that's why I was trying to say you know when we come now we really for any problem we have to have an intervention and for this women's workshop for the blind women we are really hoping that all these issues we'll have a lot of uh life experiences sharing and because we'll be all women we'll have we'll try to encourage one another to share even what we have never shared with uh with friends so that these issues come out and by coming out we even learn there are worst things we have never had which have ever happened so I'm trying to bring in the workshop the national workshop for the blind women as an intervention to give opportunities to the women to share and even learn more on how really they can avoid or really handle such problems \n<$A> And apart from the blind women who will be attending this workshop who else will be attending it maybe from other spheres nationally\n<$E> Okay \n<$A> Other spheres of development\n<$E> Okay what we have done we have drawn the resource people from uh a cross section of maybe professionals we have uh people who are coming from different NGOs We have invited for instance uh women NGOs leaders who are going to come and uh maybe enlighten the women on how to be members of different women organisations for instance I have in mind an organisation like Young Women's Christian Organisation we have invited the general secretary to come and share with the blind women because you will find such an organisation is for the women but we do not have handicapped women or really say in this case blind women being members yet They have a right to it they you know it's for them but they really don't know and they are not aware of it some of them so we have called uh resource people like those we have also called resource people from uh an NGO like AAWRD this is Association for African Women for Research and Development They are coming to tell us a lot of things they have researched on women and also gather from the blind women really what are the issues which they have also not attended to they have never thought of so we have invited resource people from a cross section of you know uh various professions besides the areas uh the disability organisations Otherwise we have also have a lot of uh disability issues which are going to be discussed and the resource people will come from those organisations \n<$B> And to add we and to add to that also you see as participants we felt it was really fit to give an environment of the blind women to have confidence in themselves This is the first seminar of its kind and it's just really necessary that the women are alone to have that self-realisation self-actualisation self-worth such that the next time now we'll have another one to integrate or if by chance they have the chance to integrate or relate with other organisations They have had that sharing aspect from their counterparts because if we were to have a combined seminar you bring maybe the sighted fifty-fifty I tell you there is always that withdrawal because through the system of education we have gone through we have always had segregation and we have never interacted in with the society so instead of the women opening up and really exposing and sharing their problems they would shy off so for the participants it's good that we just have a blind women such that we get that identity that confidence and thereafter even as they go out it will be now a milestone it's a stepping stone but when they go out it'll be a milestone\n<$E> It's like an eye-opener for the women and we expected the next time we'll move a step further and be able possibly to integrate and I think it is just an eye-opener and we really had also to give the opportunity to these women who have never even had a chance to meet a colleague you know for over maybe ten years after primary school dropped out so we are trying to also bring them to share a lot of life experiences after they maybe they left school or one who has never gone to school so it's an opportunity we would be limiting them if we really at the initial stage started bring in the sighted women so we are beginning with them give some you know they build some confidence they aware of what goes on then the next workshop will be now fairly integrated \n<$C> Definitely it's imperative that uh when participants go out of that uh workshop they should believe they should leave with something written \n<$E> \n<$C> Do you expect the resource people to come in with written material for both the blind and the sighted\n<$E> Okay what we normally do is the resource people bring printed materials you know but we have uh to transcribe the written materials in prints to Braille form and we have those facilities so the participants will get the Braille form of the handouts And that facilities available \n<$A> Now I take it that this workshop will be sort of empowering the those who will be attending so that they can do much more than they've been doing for themselves their families and even their colleagues after this workshop One area of concern especially for uh disabled women generally is that of employment and this uh sort of workshop maybe will help them to maybe think of something that they can do for themselves Maybe you could talk about this further Sinyo or Mandera how these blind women especially could be empowered so that they could even search an income-generating activity for themselves without necessarily going to look for a job in an office \n<$D> Uh I think you are right because blind women you can do quite a lot as I've said earlier on and not necessarily in the office as for like this workshop we are going to have now we'll talk and find out try to find out what each can do ash you know maybe *handworks> and such like things for example there is a group called Kenya Blind Women Association which as blind women me being one of them Josephine and some others who are not here we sat down and thought that we could start a project self-help-project which could help these uh blind women to earn their bread so we started off with a uh uh I think with those one machine which one blind woman had then she started making the sweaters you know knitting the cardigans then from there we got some six more machines from uh no two more first from American Embassy then six more form ILO so right uh now we have six ladies who are blind and they are knitting very nice sweaters and those ones they're getting themselves their bread and with that project now we can still go out when we meet these others in the seminar talk to them there are some who can do very wonderful <ea/>kiondos some can even make mats Some can make other things So if we find that there's people with that skills we can still try and see what they can do they can start their own small projects they can come together start a group maybe of even selling things like veges or such like things so it would be very very necessary for us uh when we are meeting these ladies because we will know what they can do and they can start off their own projects", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> For definition I think we'll take that one for as our premises and move on to the other present issues We are living in a society that as we as I said is in a in a state of crisis We these are the days of structural adjustment These are days of inflation These are days of women's lib and these are days when the society is witnessing an unprecedented high level of uh divorce amongst couples So I would like to ask Mr Musalia to tell us what these economic especially the economic from the economic perspective the nature of the difficulties the family unit is facing\n<$B> Uh one thing we have to know that we are living as you've said in a dynamic society in a dynamic world and a world that is interwoven with the other uh areas like for example Kenya as it were uh is not in isolation Those policies that enacted by countries like say these superpowers the Americans uh uh the Europeans they have a very direct uh effect on uh a family unit uh in this country One thing maybe we should look at first is the structural adjustment uh programs that have been uh uh proposed by the International Monetary Fund in order to bring faster economic development uh in the developing countries Now structural adjustment uh essentially is a uh has been prescribed by IMF to the Third World uh and in essence it's uh both the institutional and structural uh adjustment within the countries that will have to increase at the productive capacity of the economy One thing that comes very quickly to mind is uh the uh the increase uh the increased government expenditure within the economy should be reduced and then uh the other thing is that uh most of the government expenditures in terms of uh hospital education uh should be actually be reduced the minimal level so that the economy can be self-sustaining in the long run\n<$C> Yeah when you talk about the reduction of the government expenditure on human resource management facilities I would just like to add on that actually the effect it has on the family could be drastic You know normally the government rarely as it comes to grips with the IMF structural adjustment programs it rarely reduces such prices for basic facilities like health like education it's always going on the rise and this could have an untold effect on the family in that the family now is forced to generate more income from other quarters to cater for what was being subsidised for by the government if you look at the idea of cost-sharing in schools in health centres even in our major hospitals like Kenyatta in Nairobi the effect is being felt \n<$A> Uh thank you thank you there for that contribution I think uh we should focus on this more closely because I think it is uh the other crux of the of the problem we are discussing today because now if we take structural adjustment in a well in another crude way as a government withdrawal from funding you know the infrastructure of uh some the infrastructure I think uh what we are seeing is that uh the uh family or the society is at a very vulnerable level because now you where you didn't worry about uh how to send your son to university for example now the family has to find ways of meeting these Well the implications are of course diverse and we may not go into that but uh specifically are the are the or focusing on these economic difficulties I would like us to look for example how they affect for example the continuous if we take the family unit as Julie has said that is the basic unit of the of the of the of the society Now how do these economic difficulties for example affect decisions for example when a man is going to get married when he is not going to get married of course we have to look at the at the cultural basis and you find that traditionally in our societies and this is a habit that is going on even up to now \n<$B> Uh maybe\n<$C> maybe going to be adjusted by these programs\n<$A> all right \n<$B> Maybe before we bring in the uh cultural uh dimension we also have to realise that the family as it were besides being the unit of procreation is also uh uh consumption unit is a unit that consumes whatever is made and this that it consumes is also what this structural adjustments are adversely affecting for example say uh when the uh IMF uh comes up and says that okay you have to withdraw uh all the government all the price controls and then uh you see the prices will be left on to the demand and supply It's the demand and supply that will have to establish at what price uh some commodity will go And you see when those now when the two forces come together and determine the price you'll definitely have to see that the price will be above the reach of many of the families so the families now will have to to go scrambling I mean go looking for more to supplement the meagre resources uh it has at its disposal and that one is creating a lot of strain uh on the family as you have uh we can't rule out the factor of divorce for example \n<$A> Yeah basically Mr Musalia what you are saying has a lot of weight in it in that it is right what you are saying that these subprograms actually are creating poverty within the family and how it relates to the continuation of the family we could look at it it's though it might be hypothetical but it could have some meaning in it that now there is a situation where a man people may not even be able to marry because as we know Africans basically believe in the social exchange theory and when you come to things like bride wealth where you have to have the necessary the capability to marry you might not be able to marry if you are not able to generate that enough income or\n<$B> Now what I would think uh Mr Espisu uh is that you see we can't really say people will not marry per se people will have to circumvent the marriage uh uh idea \n<$A> yeah \n<$B> and then they try to implant their own idea Say for example now instead of going to the parents I just tell a lady now because things are too hard and too difficult Why don't you come so that we can I mean you see that one you'll have uh you'll have short-circuited a long process and you see by the way parents who will not come to you to ask for so much when you're ready uh are staying with a lady you see that In fact they will help you to do with the little you have so that maybe you have the legal basis of your marriage\n<$A> Oh thank you I think at that point what we maybe should look at is uh especially is the is the cultural element that you are bringing in and how for example has the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank when they prescribe structural adjustment do they take into account our cultural basis our cultural systems Or is this is sabotaged because at one point the crisis is this at one point we say that as Africans as Kenyans we would like to perpetuate our Kenyan identity our cultural values now we also have to contend with the structural adjustment which is been prescribed by from an outer culture another culture that is not ours\n<$B> So maybe if I can just uh point something out of that you see these are people who are in New York and these are white men and uh I really don't think if they take into consideration the cultural uh aspect of it because one thing if they would take into consideration the cultural aspect of it then we will not having uh structural adjustment in the in the first place \n<$A> Yeah what you are saying could have a lot of relevance because basically anthropologists have always argued that you know for development to be there it has to take to take note of the culture of the people it's going to develop otherwise then that development will be in vain if it's not cut out for the interest of the people at hand and here the problem is that these people who are prescribing the medicine for us are not those who know what we are suffering from But they assume they basically assume they know that these policies are right for these people It's not necessarily what they assume is right for us could be Like say if have the established projects in the rural areas that don't really benefit the family at all The family looks at them with a lot of suspicion\n<$B> You see one thing you have also to understand the structural adjustment are meant to bring change or good times in the long run but in the short run definitely uh people even us we see right now people are suffering But you see how shall we stay to that long run to know that these policies will bring the desired effect that \n<$A> And desirous to who I think that is the question that uh because of course structural adjustment talk as Musalia is saying especially saying here is that these people have sat down they've analysed the situation for us They it's not that they necessarily understand it but they think that uh in our place in our in Europe in America these programmes have worked so they should also be able to work in a in a different situation which is not logical in for uh when you are dealing with cultures So the question is do the prescription the cure we want or the cure the international monetary found is prescribing Is it what it is or is it is it the desirous effect they say that uh the programmes will bring in the long run We don't know how long that will take Is it what we'd desire or is it what they would desire themselves \n<$C> One thing I would think that this medicine uh you know is actually certainly a bitter pill and this bitter pill is being uh forced down uh our throats and uh given that the they have not tested that the efficacy of uh the drug itself you see we are being used as guinea-pigs you see and uh that is uh to our detriment because you don't know the You know when a drug is manufactured you have to get some uh animals rats and then test it on those and see if it's effective in the in some ways or the other but you see here we are now being used as that and the desired effects could even be a negative \n<$A> Yeah if you looked at it the way those structural adjustment programmes are affecting our education Basically you know education has been used as an investment by African parents for quite some time now There's that belief that if your son or daughter is educated the rest of the family benefits from this education but if you look at it now the effects are looking more drastic To take your child to the university currently it's traumatic You have to struggle with almost everybody The money is not just there through you know they believe you that people have to pay money a lot of it in fact in the concept of cost sharing to get educated But if you look at it now how it will affect the family if a child is capable of going to school and passes and is not able the parents can no longer afford to take him to university this child most likely he'll become a rebel which could have another double effect in the family itself It could even lead the break-up of the family because one party might think I'm I am not being educated because of this and that but the truth is that the parents are not able to meet the cost", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> Good evening viewers and welcome to our programme press conference In tonight's programme we shall discuss the World Food Day and our guests are honourable <name/>minister for agriculture livestock development and marketing Welcome to the programme\n<$B> Good evening viewers \n<$A> We also have Mr Harold Norton the food and agriculture organisation representative in Kenya welcome \n<$C> \n<$A> Our panelists are Mr <name/>/> Mandalo on the far right from Standard Newspapers \n<$D> Hello viewers \n<$A> Mr Johnson Gakongo from Kenya Times \n<$E> Good evening everyone \n<$A> And Mr Emman Omari from Nation Newspapers \n<$F> Good evening viewers \n<$A> to start off Mr Norton I would like you to maybe tell us uh since nineteen eighty nine to the present it looks like the food production has dropped globally by about eight per cent uh What are your global perspective of food production in the future\n<$C> \n<$A> uh uh Mr Norton before we come to the minister I think the criticism that your organisation has faced over a period of time unlike uh World Health Organisation is that you have no back-up uh to your reports You seem to produce reports more often than you seem to go out there to initiate programmes for food production Now what specific programmes do you have uh in the so-called the deficit food countries uh such as Kenya and uh Africa at large particularly your initiative You have no initiative in food production you seem to write only reports \n<$C><$A> uh Minister as we gear ourselves to celebrating the World Food Day there seems to be a serious state of affairs in our country in terms of food Now for the last three to four years there's been a decline in food production Now this situation has deteriorated to an extent that we now import maize and sugar from Uganda a country that the other day was involved in a lot of conflicts and so forth and so on Kenya having not undergone that kind of political change what is the explanation that we give to this uh food problem\n<$B> uh Thank you Firstly let me correct the impression you have that uh Kenya is importing sugar from Uganda That is not correct but we are aware that uh Kenya is informally uh importing maize from Uganda and it is true that uh the country for the last three years has uh been having uh reduced production particularly in the area of maize uh and other cereals uh The main reasons really for this apart from uh the weather conditions are that the farmer has uh become more and more commercially minded The farmer uh does not want to invest in any agricultural activity if he thinks he is not going to get adequate return and uh quite clearly uh the farmer has been finding it very difficult to produce a grain at the price that has been in existence particularly when you <./tuk> take into account the high costs of production the high costs of inputs and uh other herbicides and uh that is why we have eh recently as a government made fairly substantive adjustment uh in price to the producer so that the farmer can see that it is worthwhile producing the maize Otherwise if he thinks he's not going to get good return from maize he would grow something else which would give him uh better return and that is uh actually what has been the trend uh in the recent years \n<$A> Mr minister what assurance can you give to the viewers that Kenya in the next few years will not be importing maize will not be importing sugar because when you were appointed as a minister you went round the sugar growing areas and uh you must have come out with a report Why should you continue importing sugar Why should Kenyans line up for sugar \n<$B> Well uh Kenyans will line up for sugar because uh they are consuming more sugar than what is being produced It's as simple as that but uh uh the reality of the matter is this that uh we have to find ways and means of uh creating incentives to the farmer to produce uh more uh cane <O/> he only produces more cane and that is processed into sugar then you'll have adequate sugar but uh you refer to my recent tours uh to sugar growing areas After that I did get in touch with uh technical officers here I did also get in touch with uh friends abroad We did bring in uh  a research team from Australia on sugar They have gone round the country to identify additional areas where a cane can grow well so that uh we add uh more acreage uh on sugar cane so that we can produce more sugar and uh uh probably uh I'm going a little uh too far in informing you that we have identified other areas than the traditionally known cane growing areas Particularly the Tana belt the Tana basin uh has been identified as another area where uh a lot of sugar cane can be grown So we are actually having certain ideas on how to increase uh the sugar production but this will depend very much on uh uh the availability of funds \n<$A> Mr minister uh one wonders whether the government has uh a food policy for the immediate and the future uh of this country By policy I would like you to consider the fact that uh from nineteen sixty three when we had eight million people to nineteen ninety three when we had twenty-four million the government cannot pretend that it can subsidise some food uh uh aspects uh and then the land use You have subdivided literally every uh bloc farming the big scale farming into small little <ea/>shambas uh What is the policy on the master plan on food production\n<$B> I think uh the first thing I think I need to emphasise here is thi s that subdivision of land is not a factor in uh reducing the uh food production In fact in those areas where we used to have large scale farming if you look at the production during those years when there were some largescale farms and the production now The production now is higher than what it used to be in majority of cases I would not say the same thing when it comes to wheat production uh but in the case of maize and milk uh the subdivision of land has not created the deficit You talk about policy Yes the government has uh always got a policy on uh what to do uh regarding feeding the nation and uh as you're aware we did a have a food policy and a food security uh document which was uh approved by government and parliament in nineteen eighty-one We have been uh using that as a document Then there was uh the a sessional paper which was produced in nineteen eighty-six by the ministry of economic planning That uh went through parliament We have been using that as uh a document to support the nineteen eighty-one food policy and uh right now we are uh reviewing the whole of the nineteen eighty-one policy uh taking into account some of the decisions taken under the policy of nineteen eighty-six and soon we will be tabling in parliament the new policy on food production in this country \n<$A> Well minister I'm sorry to give you a lot of questions than your counterpart but uh we have a problem in this country because we know that uh the majority of food producers are small scale farmers Now there's a case where small scale farmers have not been able to get fertilisers In fact I would say that ninety percent of small scale farmers grow their food crops without using fertiliser and if we are saying that they're the majority producers then something should be done about it Is your ministry having any deliberate measures to afford small scale farmers who are peasant actually farmers They can't afford the exorbitant rates we have fixed on fertilisers Is there a deliberate move by your ministry to afford these farmers fertilisers so that food can be produced in this country Secondly are you convinced that extension officers from your ministry are doing a good job to advise the farmers on better ways of of uh farming methods\n<$B> Thank you um to answer the first one I would uh like to say yes I think we are all concerned about uh the distribution of the inputs uh to the small scale farmers and uh indeed one of the things that has made small scale farmers not to use all the inputs that are necessary for food production is uh first there hasn't been very good distribution system uh Many of the people who were supposed to be distributors the middlemen uh some of them are far away from the farmer They have no means of having access to the ordinary small farmer in the country side let's say in Kahadscha uh where maize is grown We also know that the in this country we have been using too many middlemen When you get the fertiliser for example or herbicides from a factory overseas then it comes through an importer That importer has  a wholesaler who also takes his commission Then there is another distributor who takes some commission Then there is a the retailer who takes another commission Now all these people having taken their commissions that commission plus the original cost is added to the price of fertiliser and therefore the farmer finds it a little bit too high the price to pay and therefore he's reluctant to use it because it is too costly Now you must have heard uh recently in some of my statements that we are organising the farmers organisations either through co-operatives that they are assisted uh either through uh organisations like AFC or the the co-operative bank to get funds so that they have uh they arrange for direct import of the fertiliser which then moves straight on to the farmer directly and that is being done uh very successfully already by the Muranga co-operative union and we think if this is done in the case of maize in other areas the cost of production could be reduced substantially\n<$A> Mr Nijai to uh\n<$B> uh I have not answered the second one\n<$A> extension of staff\n<$B> on extension of staff uh I want to uh uh confirm to you that uh your concern regarding the extension service is our concern in the ministry and indeed it is true that our extension staff have not been as mobile as they should be and we are getting them now uh to organise uh specific programmes which must be monitored by the district agricultural officers so that the farmers are constantly in touch with this extension staff for technical assistance uh both in the livestock area as well as uh the crop area and uh we think with uh that uh encouraged interaction between the farmers and the extension staff it will give the farmers also more knowledge on uh modern farming and I think they will also feel that they are being supported uh through advice \n<$A> Mr Nijai uh to move away a bit from uh from maize and sugar production let's go maybe to meat Kenyans also consume meat Are the artificial insemination services still there and what is happening there in the meat commission\n<$B> First uh in the case of artificial insemination That is a programme which is worrying us in the ministry a great deal right now This programme uh used to have external support and uh that external support has actually dwindled It is uh getting less and less and uh uh in fact there are signals that the programme that used to exist may end towards the end of this year uh but we are working out some other arrangements uh in order to boost the performance of the artificial insemination This is an area we cannot afford o allow to uh uh deteriorate uh If it deteriorates you can rest assured you will have milk shortage in another few years in this country Therefore it is a programme that we have to support and uh while talking about this I must say that there are so many people in Kenya here who seem to take it for granted that that uh myth of uh privatisation can uh actually work in everything because even uh right now there are a lot of people including you journalists uh who write about privatisation of the AI privatisation of uh food distribution and the rest of it without going into details how can this be done For example how do you do privatisation of the AI without working it out very carefully and establishing units of private people who can do the work I mean it's not just a question of changeover like uh playing football and if one has uh a injured leg and then you bring him the result It doesn't work that way so I think that needs to be watched very carefully and that is why I some people may have seen that I have some degree of reluctance in uh this so-called privatisation I have to do it in a systematic way so that \n<$F>What measures are being taken to curb this situation and protect the marine life in that lake\n<$B> Well I will not be able to talk in details about uh the fish industry as such because uh it doesn't really come under my portfolio but I'd like to assure you as a minister of the Kenya government that uh this is a matter which I know is being looked into very carefully The marine research people have already uh pointed out some of these things and eh I am pretty clear in my own mind and I'm aware that uh measures are being taken to make sure that eh pollution is avoided \n<$A> but Mr minister \n<$B> Had we finished the KMC\n<$?> No just the financial problems \n<$B> Yes the KMC has financial problems uh not only for operational purposes but the KMC is extremely old and uh we are uh right now uh very keen to do uh a rehabilitation of both KMC here and the KMC in Mombasa uh and for your information as we are talking there is uh a rehabilitation going on with regard to the coming section of the KMC in <name/> Another thing that we are doing is to encourage establishment of slaughter houses in the beef producing areas so that uh we can avoid walking animals long distances By the time they reach KMC they are really emaciated animals We would rather slaughter them at uh the point of supply uh and then move uh the meat under cold storage to the markets \n<$A> Mr Norton uh from the discussions we have had here it looks like you have an overview of the problems we have in this country right away I don't know what your organisation is doing to assist the ministry of agriculture overcome some of these problems", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1ce9b722-d53b-4ebf-a8b3-ff79d122eaf3',

{'text': "<$A> Good Evening and welcome to Radio Press Conference! The Kenya Society for the Blind will be holding a national women's workshop on awareness and sensitisation from Monday next week In Press Conference today we'll be discussing the situation of a blind woman Our guests are Josephine Sinyo a senior State Counsel at the Attorney-General's Office and she is accompanied to our studios by Lucy Mandera a telephone operator with an international company here in Nairobi and Mrs Anastasia Mwangi who is a rehabilitation officer Women and Family Support Programme at the Kenya Society for the Blind \nWith me at the panel is \n<$C> James Mwaura \n<$A> and I am Loise Wamyoike\n<$A> Welcome to the programme and perhaps we could start with any of you could open the discussion by for instance telling us the background of the Kenya Society for the Blind \n<$E> Okay thank you Loise Kenya Society for the Blind is a non-profit non-political non-governmental organisation which was established by an Act of Parliament on October fifteenth nineteen fifty-six uh If I may summarise the objectives the objectives are: to prevent blindness cure blindness promote the welfare education training and employment of the blind Really I would just say that this is a summary of what is KSB Kenya Society for the Blind \n<$C> And how does one become a member\n<$E>The membership is open to everyone We have uh let me say we have two types of membership uh If you wish you could become a life member uh This is a service provider organisation and specifically to the uh people with visual handicap and the blind uh for that matter That is our target group So the membership for life as a life member is three thousand Kenya Shillings and for instance if a company wishes also to be a member the membership is Kenya Shillings fifteen thousand We feel this is just to really uh give a hand in the uh work which is being done by Kenya Society for the Blind Possibly later I may have an opportunity to give a brief of what Kenya Society for the Blind is doing their activities national-wide \n<$A> And you'll be holding a workshop for women next week that is from Monday Maybe Sinyo you could tell us what to expect what issues will be highlighted and discussed during this one-week seminar\n<$B> Well uh the forthcoming seminar has so many topics Actually it cuts across the board on all matters that affect a woman and in particular a blind woman uh I remember I'm officially invited to present a paper on legal issues and rights affecting women generally So you find that there are some of these things that we take for granted that people know about them yet in a matter of fact people are not aware of them \n<$C> What should you expect from that topic there are  topics on women's legal issues and rights\n<$B> Well legal matters pertaining to women have been very sensitive in the public but what we are really up to do is to educate these women that there are matters in the law that actually that touch to their lives Matters in specific could be relating to property relating to succession for instance relating to marriage matters like maintenance custody of children you know matters that in one way or another a woman a woman's life is affected by it \n<$A> Now we are glad that both you Sinyo and Mandera are here with us Both of you are blind women and maybe this is a very good opportunity to maybe give us your experiences from your places of work as part of maybe what will be discussed at this forthcoming workshop Could we start with you Mandera\n<$D> Yeah thank you Loise To start with as I'd said earlier on I have worked for the last twenty-three years as a telephone operator with a company called Old East Kenya Limited and uh surely I have had enough experience and the company also likes my work because I'm doing it properly and from that experience I could just say that most blind women are only not given chance to try and prove out that they can be able to do some good jobs because as a blind person I've never had any complaints from any of my bosses and even the customers themselves Actually the last two years I received award for having been the best blind operator in that company and I think what it is is that we'll talk to these women who'll be coming for the seminar So that we see where the problem is because most people sees I mean see blind people as a uh I could say like a burden because when they see you even when you're going for an interview before you even you're allowed to attend the interview they see you as you cannot do anything But really this is not the thing The blind woman can do a lot in the in the society and if I can talk a bit about uh married life: I personally got married when I was blind and I got married to a sighted man not a blind man as people think that if you are blind you are only allowed to marry a blind person It was not the case But here the problem comes when the family of the person who wants to marry you don't want you because they see as their son is just getting lost because as a woman you know there're so many things you are supposed to do in the family they are supposed to go and fetch water from the river get firewood from the forest or whichever do the cooking in the house and when they see a blind man marrying a I mean sorry sighted person marrying a blind woman they think it's a bother but it's not the case and I think what I could only conclude is that the blind woman should be taken just like any other woman because they can do all sorts of things\n<$C> You mean you should not sympathise with them \n<$D> No we don't want sympathy We want to be given chance and prove ourselves out that we are able to do things \n<$C> At this juncture Sinyo one would like to know how you became a lawyer \n<$B> Well as uh Miss Mandera has ably put it It's the chance and it happened that I got the chance I went through school primary secondary and A-level \n<$C> in this country\n<$B> In this country And at A-level I decided We had a pioneer-man who had already become a blind lawyer and he was the first one and I wondered why I shouldn't also make it history to be the first blind woman So all what we need is the chance! And I was given the chance and I've proved it that the blind woman can also be capable to be a lawyer \n<$A> And coming to you again Mandera You talked of the sort of negative attitude that possibly not possibly but you actually go through encounter with your family and the community at large How do you think this negative attitude could be overcome\n<$D> Uh I think the only way that we can overcome their the negative attitude from the families is by them accepting us as we are because if for example you yourself now Loise as you are you go to an accident and maybe you lose your one of your legs or your arm surely you'll not feel good if you are neglected or you are not accepted in the family So as blind women as we are we need to be accepted in the family because we also get children in fact we have very many children if I can say that and our children do very well Some of us our children are already working and they have children now we are grandmothers So surely a blind woman can do more if one is given time So and this is why I say that we must first of all first of all be accepted from our own families and then now the community also has to accept us and uh give us just chance and then we can always do our best \n<$A> Now Mandera you'll agree with me that you just can't be accepted like that otherwise because you have to play your part as it is supposed to You also have to give as much as your you expect to receive In your case how did you overcome this negative attitude\n<$D> Uh In my case now this is my personal experience: I lost my sight when I was a young girl in school but my late husband decided that he was still going to marry me Although the family brought a lot of problems they really refused completely but he also said this is the woman I'm marrying So by him you know being very you know steady we decided and said okay let's move and go ahead and get married and we did but it was unfortunate that so after some time he got in an accident and he passed away but still even if he did he left me with one child I continued I educated her Up to now she's now working as <O/> Now she is a mother also actually a mother of two So me my overcoming the problem I did this because I didn't sit back I just said I have to do it everything that a woman is supposed to do Maybe only driving is what I can't do But fetching water cooking ironing I used to do everything and I'm still doing that So by so doing now when you prove that you can do your own things without bothering anybody they just leave you alone and then now by so doing you just succeed and go ahead\n<$C> Now you being blind and you being blind and being women in place What type of problems do you face in your places of work\n<$B> Well if I may just add to what Miss Mandera said earlier from the experience at her place of work You see they say it's perceiving is what people really get to be convinced to it If at place of work in as much as you have the papers with you cannot meet the expectations of people by one thing being punctual maybe as a woman also what they would want to see very much it's your grooming and then to top it up they would also want to see your performance We have all the potentials but we can't rule out that the fact that we are blind we don't need support We need support even in those places of work The offices have to be accessible you have to be oriented in the place to know where everything is and then if it is like my work demands a lot of reading of course we need support from the colleagues from your bosses and if the climate at work is conducive I believe we are as capable of performing in fact even more than our than our counterparts because if with my blindness and I always want to challenge people if with my blindness one can make it to attain law to be a lawyer how much more if I'd my sight I always think I would have been a pilot \n<$A> That's commendable Now we There is a lot of violence generally against women and I believe it's even more so for the women with disabilities and especially the blind they are more vulnerable Maybe *Missus> Sinyo you could talk about this and especially sexual abuse \n<$B> Well this is an area which for quite some time I've featured on the forefront violence against women and as a blind woman I think inasmuch as the disabled women are all vulnerable but we suffer from double jeopardy You see all the other disabilities they have the sight with them", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '707bdcca-96bb-4cfc-939d-7fdeee8f4bcb', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.142055+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9851111173629761, 'non_english_score': 0.014888882637023926}
{'text': "<$A> Welcome to the programme My colleague at the panel is\n<$B> Alex Sibawi\n<$A> and I am Loise <name/> once again welcoming you to the programme\n<$B> Uh many conferences and exhibitions have been held before on computer Now this one which you are organising what is its target and how is it going to be different from the others Mr Siganga \n<$C> Uh thank you very much Alex Uh this particular conference as you have rightly said there have been so many held uh this particular conference is going to be different from the others that we have been attending in the recent uh years because the target group is going to be completely different that is we are targeting the decision-makers and the policy-makers uh in our country to come and attend this conference The particular papers that are going to be presented are going to uh focus more on uh what computers can do and what they have done rather than uh focusing on uh theoretical issues and concepts So this uh uh particular conference is going to be different because of those two issues the people we are targeting and the kind of material we are going to be able to give to them \n<$A> What's the objective of this First National Conference as you are calling it Mr Koebe \n<$D> Now the objectives of uh this particular conference first and foremost is to sensitise the key policy and decision makers on the potentials of IT And also we are looking at uh a forum to uh or rather to provide a forum for investors and developers to share their experiences and facilitate exchange of ideas And lastly another uh objective is actually to increase the IT awareness and expose participants to new and emerging trends products and services of IT \n<$B> Apart from the policy makers and decision makers who are going to be uh in this conference what other people are going to be there because uh if you just uh include only these people then uh maybe you are not going far \n<$D> Yah we haven't left out the other of uh the spectrum We have also included senior education managers educators and uh the researchers We have also included uh we're also targeting leading professionals uh in the legal business education entertainment and also medical field and financial areas And also we are also looking at IT managers and practitioners who are actually in uh self-taught uh situations \n<$A> So it's like uh you have a varied cross-section of the disciplines or the professions to be represented at this particular conference What do you hope to achieve Mr Sihanya at the end of this conference \n<$E> At the end of the conference we hope to have disseminated information regarding the status of IT in Kenya issues which are emerging such as multimedia where you have information merging with communications for example We hope that for example lawyers will have an understanding of how they can utilise IT in their practice businesses how they can utilise IT in making their transactions and as well how IT can be used in government uh systems\n<$B> Mr Siganga has just talked about uh what computers have done Maybe could you tell us a bit of uh what you think the computers have done and what they are going to do to us \n<$C> Well uh in this particular instance we have actually uh uh put uh the presentations in uh into different areas For example we want to know what the computers have done in government situations We want to know what the computers have done in uh business so it will be different in every uh presentation And we are expecting some uh senior uh civil servants to come from some of the countries that have been able to implement uh computing successfully in their environment to come and talk to us to come and talk to our people here on a peer to peer level So the details will be uh available from those papers We are also expecting uh senior uh managers from uh local companies to come and talk to their to other senior managers on a peer to peer level I must emphasise that some of these presentations are not going to be really on a technical a technicalRRR level We are interested mainly in bottom-line issues here For example if we have uh a presenter who is talking from a local company he does not have to be an IT person but just someone who is interested in IT and his company has been able to implement IT successfully Therefore he is coming to talk to the other managers and tell them for example how has IT helped his company to increase the efficiency or to improve the profits of that particular company So the the particulars of the presentations will be in the papers but that will be the general outline \n<$A> So what kind of papers or topics will be discussed during this four-day conference Mr Koebe \n<$D> Uh some of the papers which will be discussed actually uh include a very wide area that uh IT uh affects and some of them actually are on topics like career opportunities in IT We are looking at human resources and training We are looking at uh social implications of IT And of course we are also looking at the cyberspace the information superhighway and also multimedia and emerging technologies just to mention a few \n<$B> The uh changing times of computer industry You find that uh take for example of Microsoft Windows Ninety-Five It has just come out and maybe by next year there will be something else And these are people you are just going to are just going toRRR give them information on uh IT at one particular time and next time they will have changed Now what are you going to do to be updating them every now and then \n<$C> Well uh that's uh this particular conference will actually be an annual conference so this is not uh the first and the last So uh you said uh rightly information technologies is a fast-changing field And that is the reason we want to keep holding this uh particular conference and give them the kind of information how they can be able to manage this change that is occurring in information technology \n<$A> Now Mr Sihanya what would you say is the current status of the use of uh information technology that is computers in the country \n<$E> I think uh quite a number of organisations including governments uh private sector generally and educational institutions are picking up uh mainly because it's no longer very easy to communicate or pass over information unless you are in an in some kind of a network or unless you are using computers to process uh the data and information that institutions have but a number of institutions have not <AmE/>gotten into the use of computers and this is one of the reasons why this conference is being held So far it's not very impressive as we shall for example in the legal sector where a number of lawyers still use manual typewriters to process various documents\n<$A> So what role would you say that uh information technology can play in the national development of a country like Kenya \n<$D> I think this is one of the very most important issues arising now that because many developing developed countries and even a few countries like Mauritius in the developing world have adopted IT to do commerce for example so that you don't need to shift data and files from one country to another You can easily transfer these files using computer networks A number of uh uh businesses such as air line reservations are now being done through computer networking Banking already is benefiting quite a lot where you don't have to walk with huge sums of money or with checks and checkbooks You can easily use the ATM system And there are other areas like education So many schools universities are getting hooked up in computer systems so as to facilitate their how they can use information which is stored in computers So it's a very important area I think \n<$B> Looking at uh the issue of computer industry one cannot escape to say that the training aspect of computer here in Kenya uh is the kind of thing that brings a lot of problems because computer schools or institutions train in their own way others do it in their own way Mr Siganga maybe could you give us uh a clear-cut uh uh light on this \n<$C> Yes what you've said has been a problem for uh quite some time particularly in the last uh five or so years when we have had so many computer training establishments uh being set up uh Now the uh Computer Society of Kenya together in conjunction with the Ministry of uh Research Technical Training uh and Technology has been working on this issue over the last three years and uh I'm glad to say that uh we have come up with some uh quite tangible benefits For example last year the Directory of Industrial Training came out with uh guidelines for computer training establishments that wish to offer short term courses to users Uh also uh we have been working with the ministry to come up with uh a professional syllabus that uh a national professional syllabus that can be acceptable to all people because uh the other syllabuses that we have had in the past all had some uh drawbacks For example we had uh uh one syllabus that was taking three years uh compared to some other syllabuses from some foreign uh uh examiners which uh take as little as six months for a diploma course Also we may uh remember or we may recall that uh the examinations from abroad have been a problem because of the high expense involved in paying for the examination uh fees So this particular exercise that we have been doing with the ministry was try to rationalise the uh professional training that is a training at least at diploma level so that we can come up with uh a national syllabus And that exercise is still uh in progress Also the Computer Society has uh on its own initiative come up with a uh few things that they are doing to to try and uh standardise uh the issue over of training or at least also advise and inform the general public about issues regarding training For example the Society has just uh published a guide to computer training in Kenya that gives in very uh simple terms some of the issues uh related to training and uh uh gives also some of the courses and who really would benefit from some of these courses and what colleges are offering these courses And that guide has just been published and is going to be available to the general public from the beginning of October Also from January nineteen ninety-six uh the Computer Society uh is uh uh planning to start accrediting colleges uh computer training establishments Now the Computer Society of Kenya is not a supervisory or a does not have supervisory powers over uh computer training establishments but we are going to start accrediting them and we hope that the fact that uh giving uh an education that uh an establishment is accredited with the Computer Society of Kenya is going to uh give information that that particular establishment is meeting uh certain standards high standards of professionalism in its training programmes is going to be a motivating factor for many establishments to come forward and join the Computer Society of Kenya as corporate members and be accredited uh to the Computer Society of Kenya \n<$B> Take for example now uh if uh a student pays a lot of money to an institution and this institution doesn't provide the kind of uh education this student wants and maybe want to withdraw from there Now what kind of legal measures can he take if that particular institution doesn't want to refund that money \n<$E> Well on the side of the Computer Society of Kenya uh we uh are addressing this issue and we have a committee which we call the uh Standards Committee uh and this uh particular committee is actually uh uh charged with dealing with ethics of the profession So if that particular training establishment is a corporate member of the Computer Society of Kenya then we try to resolve that issue uh between that particular student and that college But as I say that uh college has to be uh a member of the Computer Society of Kenya so that we can be able to take up that issue", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '793054ed-cc7f-4d17-b5d6-6117ad8fcdea', 'added':

there are over very many there are\n<$B> We are getting the point What we're trying to say is the chief is used as a stepping stone to help the society So it's the chief who'll ensure that this kid is at least taken to a certain school within that locality From school this kid has to report back to the camp and it's to the chief to oversee that that is done on a daily basis\n<$A> So you uh \n<$B> So you cannot expect uh maybe uh a child health welfare officer \n<$C> What are you trying to say What Leave that to <O/>\n<$B> Okay \n<$C> Listen to me <name/>\n<$B> wait we are talking about that uh hierarchy You don't expect a provincial welfare officer to come from the province to take care of this child \n<$C> But they don't have the power Listen to me <ea/>Bwana <name/> listen\n<$B> I hope you understand what hierarchy means\n<$C> I know what a hierarchy is \n<$B> What does it mean\n<$C> You're a very funny man do you know that \n<$B> What\n<$C> Hierarchy it it's you know that system of a I mean the system from \n<$?> the top\n<$C> the head to the top I mean to the bottom \n<$B> to the bottom \n<$C> you think I cannot know that stupid but I'm telling you <ea/>Bwana <name/> that uh uh these children Who will remove them from the streets and take them to the chief camps It's not easy also \n<$B> yeah\n<$C> And this uh the money that these children are keeping You're out you are going out of the topic You know the chiefs cannot just afford to bring all these children to the to the chiefs' camps as you are saying Because if you are saying that in Nairobi there are about twenty-five chiefs and those children are over let's say over five hundred thousand children \n<$B> So really we are trying to say this We are trying to combine the government take the legal aspect of it and after taking the legal aspect of it bring down that work to the chief So orders come from the top Such and such an amount of food Such uh such a uh number of schools\n<$C> Excuse me <ea/>Bwana <name/> \n<$B> are supposed to be catered for by this chief \n<$C> <ea/>Bwana Austin could you please advise this uh \n<$B> So Austin what do you have to say about that 'cause really we're not getting the point \n<$A> What I have to say about this is Okay why aren't all the kids in the street taken care of if the chief is supposed to take care of these kids \n<$C> I don't know why you're talking\n<$B> Are you trying to say it's 'cause of the chief who is not enforcing pressure on the government so that he \n<$C> and explain to him\n<$B> You get what I'm saying \n<$C> The chief is not that powerful The government has got uh uh very many things to do This uh taking care of the children in the streets is left to uh such a group of people\n<$B> Fine what I'm what I was \n<$C> not the chiefs\n<$B> trying to say is a suggestion \n<$C> oh you're just suggesting\n<$B> I know that it is not possible for it to work inside the city \n<$C> There are organisations which are trained to take care of these children\n<$B> Yeah but already there are organisations and they're not working\n<$C> That's why I'm telling you there are not enough That's why I'm saying we should add I think what they should do they should have more organisations coming up \n<$B> But it requires now more which means it requires more expatriates more money \n<$C> No you don't need expatriates for that expatriates cannot come from that come and take They also have poor people in their country there You don't need expatriates for that\n<$A> But you don't understand that Kenya is a third-world country \n<$C> No but they also have very poor people in Europe Austin <ea/>Bwana Austin You really don't understand that In every society \n<$A> No but I have been there myself\n<$C> In every society there are poor people \n<$A> You know when they talk about poor people they don't mean the poor people like in Kenya There are poor people like our average in Kenya What do you have to say to that <ea/>Bwana <name/>\n<$B> Yes I think that is right Because all you hear all you now we're losing the point we're losing direction actually and when you talk about expatriates I'm not talking about bringing poor very uh abject people of abject poverty from Europe We're bringing here people who have the knowledge and who can uh demonstrate that knowledge\n<$C> Okay stop there stop there Do you know what expatriates are I do not mean they're going to pick the poor They have to bring a person with knowledge Do you know what the word expatriate mean \n<$B> okay I do\n<$C> uh what a person with knowledge has to come here But I was telling you that we don't need such people here in Kenya please for such to do something like that \n<$B> we do\n<$C> Do not get someone like that \n<$B> We do We need psychologists We need psychotherapists\n<$C> We have psychotherapists here in Kenya\n<$B>Are you sure they can handle that here in Kenya\n<$C> They can handle yes \n<$B> Okay give me an example of uh \n<$A> Okay since you can't answer that question maybe our uh newcomer here can help a bit What do you have to say about that <ea/>Bwana Theresa\n<$B> What do you have to say about street children what's your view about them\n<$D> As to what Could you please rephrase this\n<$A> You don't understand\n<$D> your question\n>$B> street children What do you have to say about it since that all us here can't seem to give us an example of some expatriates who in psychology So what do you have to say about that \n<$D> What I think is chiefs' children\n<$A> Could you talk Talk louder please\n<$D> Could you please miss your miss your question relating to a certain view about street children We are not writing about street children There are so many things\n<$A> Now don't you think they're rejected or what do you think can be done to facilitate their staying in Kenya uh\n<$D> What I think is street children can be helped by \n<$B> what I think is you haven't got your ideas straight Okay but me in my own view I see that there're very many factors that have led to the rejection of street children in Kenya There are so many which I think <O/> wants to spit out in a hurry Tell us \n<$E> I think some of those problems the street children cause are actually part of us Okay so we think street children are supposed to be taken care of by the citizens themselves We aren't going to live for anybody to do for us this job What we are going to do is to marshal all these aspects of uh society including the government the uh the democratic uh system all this including even the education sector so that we come up with something concise to take care of these children So if these children can be *incultivated> into the schools maybe they'd come back to paddle to the students' body It will be okay Because now we are trying to take care of a child who has lost direction So we are not going to help that child by giving him money in the streets We're just spoiling that child So Austin what do you have to say because it appears you offered the idea that these children should be kept in the streets and given money and whatever\n<$A> No no that's wrong that's wrong as you heard giving them money is a very poor suggestion because as you know people just they don't give them a good amount of money Like the other day so you give them two shillings you see two shillings what can it buy can it buy you anything can it \n<$E> so that\n<$A> can it \n<$E> I think that was a case where it was a beggar and this is I think uh\n<$A> No it was some street child who looked very hungry You see if two shillings can't help you why are you giving it to him There is nothing he can do with it The only thing he can buy is glue And as you know glue not only does it make you high it also satisfies your hunger So with two shillings in tip? they can't buy anything like chips or something I think glue is the most effective thing that comes to that pops in their mind So me I think if they're to stay in the streets people should give them an amount of money that you can use yourself on something 'Cause like in two shillings I say you really just play with two shillings in the house like it was you're playing with papers \n<$?> I think\n<$A> You see so now what I think that should happen is this street if the kid had to stay in the street like I said I think you should give him a good amount of money Or if not I think the government should do something by I think what do you think raising up the taxes so as to facilitate the staying of these children What do you think \n<$A> So I think if we are to do that we will be encouraging these children to stay in the streets because uh a poor child in uh from a poor family will definitely grow up in the streets because he or she he or she automatically knows that there will be tax paid so that they he survives in that street So it will not be helping that child It will only be encouraging the situation\n<$E> I don't think you're getting the point here I'm saying if you are to give them money Like the other day I remember giving another small boy about a pound Do you know what he did with it \n<$A> don't know I have no idea\n<$B> What did he with it\n<$E> I saw him rush to the it was in Westlands He rushed to the nearest kiosk and got himself a hot bucket of chips He was very happy In fact you wouldn't believe it He went and sat down there and he began feasting on those things like never before So what do you think about this \n<$A> Okay Laura do you hate street children or do you like them\n<$D> Uh street children are children who really need to be helped So as you're passing along and see a child a street child it is very wise for you at least to give him all you have \n<$A> No but you see that's not the issue here The issue here is getting the street children off of the streets What do you think about that\n<$B> I think\n<$A> Don't you think that's a point\n<$B> I think it's a point but the solution not of the problem", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '77dd1db8-1187-4850-9b6a-275c42552c54', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.144136+00:00',

{'text': "<$C> Uh I think I totally disagree with what the two have said because first of all what is a cult because what you are saying is that these break-away groups are cults because first of all we did not define a cult because uh if we take it on that issue of unemployment we are going to say that most of these uh independent churches are cults So if you look at uh I would rather say that uh so far the definition of a cult that we have been getting is from the Christian side which is very unfair because if we look at some of the groups which are called cults They're actually just normal religious groups and in any case some of those groups that are pointed out as cults actually comprise of very wealthy men Talk of devil worship They say uh people worship the devil for material gains and all that I don't actually believe it's because the youth are dropping out of churches What I think has really boosted a number of the so-called cults if they are actually cults I would say is uh uh lack of satisfaction in the streamline churches that are there and that doesn't necessarily mean the youth Anybody can be dissatisfied where you are And so what we are pointing out is that we get some of these mainstream churches pointing out that group is a cult and that group is a cult and that group is a cult You ask why it's all based on hearsay So I've actually for the question asked why cults are being if cults are being boosted by the uh by the number of youth that are dropping out of churches I don't think that's right\n<$A> Nyongesa you have uh you've actually put me in a kind of abysses to what uh your idea of cult is What definition would you give to cult\n<$E> Okay uh I would say a cult is a ritualistic group doesn't have to be necessarily a church or something like that just a ritualistic group uh uh bound up with their own kind of uh or ritual a close-knit group say so far the best example we've got is a of people pointing what a cult is maybe freemasons who are just actually a group of people who got together If you look at their history it was because of uh on humanitarian grounds to get together to accomplish a certain objective And so it became a group sharing their own secrets and all that If then that's the example of a cult that you have really maybe we have two or three cults in Kenya and very few on that\n<$A> Ruth what would you tell us about it \n<$F> I would think that uh the reason why we have cults is because people are dissatisfied with the main the main churches the main established churches and when I say people I don't really mean the youth In fact uh no hardly not the youth but the adults So I think I really don't think the youth are really are contributing to\n<$?> the increase\n<$F> of cults\n<$?> Excuse me I just want to point something about what Makhoha was talking about You're talking about cults coming up because of dissatisfaction with the main churches Well what brings up dissatisfaction Don't you think it's something to do with materialism especially in this world of ours What can make you really be dissatisfied with this church with the Catholic Church or with the Protestant Church if it caters for your spiritual needs\n<$D> Uh let me give an example of the same thing in my church because as it is an you know the independent church I can quote the Litodua Church at Ruiru It's been split for quite some time it's only the other day that they are coming together If you look at the Catholic Church they've got Legio Maria you know it's all it all centres on leadership You know someone somewhere wants to have you know to get that leadership Actually I think it centres on I still cling to my point that you know frustrations in life\n<$E> And excuse me for one thing I would like to clarify We have not really established what cults are because what you're discussing\n<$D> Yah \nare independent churches in most cases So uh I would actually this term cult having been coined especially right by Christian circles has been used by Christian with their own specification to point out to particular groups that these are cults and these and these and these And so what I do think is that in some cases some of these groups are actually not cults just independent churches \n<$?> Uh I think a cult is something that carries out some funny-looking rituals as I would maybe if I may dare early enough when the Christian religion was just getting established It was it actually looked like a cult to many people If you stood outside and you listened to them you know they would talk of uh we drink your blood and eat your body You know that would look strange yeah as long as these things I think uh at that time it was actually a cult or it was considered as such And right now our equivalent of cults I think are these secret organisations that seem to worship some unknown power and seem to involve some *ununderstandable> unfathomable uh rituals like say cutting off peoples' bits and pieces and using them in worship Uh this has come up in West Africa and I think we had some of it we had our own share of it somewhere in nineteen eight-seven\n<$A> I think let's look at cults as uh maybe a sect or a group which uh has its own beliefs away from the Bible or away from the mainline teachings not necessarily Christian teachings but just away from uh moral teachings \n<$?> And if we look at them like that I mean what is there the attitude of the youth towards the cult\n<$A> Okay If I may ask you Couldn't we have cults without the Christian religion like we could have cults in a traditional African cults you know we could have cults within the Islam religion like we have quite a you know we have people like the sheikhs Muslims or what Actually what we've been doing that we're looking at the this idea of cult from a religious point of view I personally myself looking from my point of view I would look it look at it you know you know every group would to me appear like a cult because if the Catholic church does not behave you know it does not behave in the same way with the Catholics You know apart from a few saved people who claim they can worship with any person actually the mainline churches they're all different They carry their own things differently They do not you know to me they're just cults You know there's no difference between Christianity Islam uh the Tent of the Living God and the African Ngiku wa Mumbi such things you know Actually I think we should look at the definition of a cult the meaning of a cult from uh a personal point of view rather from the religious point of view \n<$?> and uh and if you ask me as a youth what I think about cults I would think from the definition we have got they may exist outside the churches but as for these groups we have pointed out as cults I would say they're not \n<$F> Actually what they are they are secret societies with uh with their secrets\n<$A> With their own secret worship\n<$F> Yes my view is that okay the attitude of the youth towards these cults realise that the youth really have a very strong sense of curiosity so once they hear there's something difficult about it you always have this sense of I want to find out what it's all about So secretly you realise that even you can have your own friend who's a freemason member and you don't know So it's really the youth are really trying to penetrate into these cults to look for satisfaction They want to see what's in this cult what's so secretive about this \n<$A> Uh okay I think we'll have to find some other time to discuss that It seems it's very deep Let's look at the issue of music and uh religion Uh there is the sentiment among the Christian circles that demonic uh worship is being perpetrated through modern music What is your view on this Makhoha\n<$C> Well they can see what they want to see but music is creativity and music is art So I think people ought to enjoy it And you know when you decide to say such a highly contentious to make such a highly contentious statement such as this I mean demonic worship in music you don't expect people to believe you So that is one of the reasons that is going to chase the youth away from the Church I don't believe there's anything like demons I've not seen any so far\n<$A> Okay yes\n<$F> Okay according to what you've said You might not expect people to believe you on such a on such a statement But there could be a grain of truth in it How do you know how do know demonic worship is not being channelled through music It could be because sometimes if you listen to something to these beats like rock-and-roll music they really get to you I mean you really feel like you're possessed You see these people on telly you dancing like they are not really they have something in them So you're bound to believe there's something about this rock-and-roll stuff\n<$E> If I may reply to that I mean I've listened to rock-and-roll before I've never <AmE/>gotten mad I've never <slang/>gotten possessed by demons And well if I may say something I think what they really tend to generalise is some of this music like there's a negative there's a whole negative view towards Reggae music for example we get a lot of negative talk from Christianity about Reggae music And this is because you know some of this does not necessarily uh uh uh point towards positive values like there's one I used to enjoy until I finally could get the words It was saying it was about Cocaine it was talking about uh Don't oppose it legalise it yeah You know it's very enjoyable until you get the words So I think when the Christians really listen to some of the words they become outraged and they decide to classify all of it as demonic \n<$?> Yeah uh I think I think I do agree with that because actually music is creativity So what you do have is that uh we are having a sort of a Christian culture around And so I would say this issue of demonic music has come as the result of Christian fundamentalists who are really scared of that wholly uh sanctified music of those and these being watered down to become modern So what you have is that whenever they see a certain uh uh excitement that will really carry people anyway that's what it's supposed to be actually religious music is supposed to appeal to the people And so uh if it's not religious not talking about God what they think is that uh this music is demonic which I totally disagree with because some of this music is very *educative> And in any case God created people with minds with a sense to feel with a sense to enjoy So what you have is that uh you have music which totally appeals and makes a man enjoy himself \nS1BDIS1K\n<$A> Africa is the poorest of the continents of the world We do hear that disproportionate amounts of funds are spent on arms\n<$D> <$B> The world development report nineteen ninety-two tells us that Malawi in nineteen ninety spent five point four percent of central government expenditure on the defence Zaire spent six point seven percent on uh defence while spending only zero point seven per cent on health And this picture is reflected everywhere Take Kenya for instance in nineteen ninety uh Kenya spent seven point eight per cent on defence while spending only five point four per cent on health In real terms we find that the most basic needs like health education or housing are not given emphasis but defence expenditure far more surpass expenditures in this specific area\n<$A> You mentioned uh what Africa needs most as compared to military aid Can you tell us what Africa needs\n<$B> Africa as a developing country needs to educate its human resources Africa needs to have a healthy human resource because no country has really developed without a healthy human resource and without an educated human resource which also has to be adequately housed African countries need to develop the educational sector and the health sector more than it needs to develop the military sector\n<$A> Often the expenditure on uh the armed forces on munitions it's not really aimed at uh causing external threats uh The expenditure on the armed forces is in many aspects related to the forms of government that exist in a country\n<$D> <$A> Can there be any justification for a government importing munitions to deal with this problem\n<$D> <$A> During the years of the Cold War we had communism and capitalism fighting one another and they didn't care what was really happening in their satellite countries The situation has kind of changed We need to create peace How can this transition be created\n<$B> The end of the Cold War has definitely created new opportunities A lot more energies will have to be released from uh preoccupations with uh military adventures and all the rest and resources shifted from military expenditure to expenditure on health and social services\n<$D> <$B> The post-Cold War environment in Africa I think is very conducive to peace in the long run Even though we have seen that the end of the Cold War has initially *unreleased> several forces that threaten peace and security in in Africa For instance the democratisation processes in Africa which have been brought forward by the end of the Cold War because these leaders have now lost patrons of the Cold War and therefore they have to yield in the long term This democratisation process which is a result of the end of the Cold War will end up creating a more peaceful environment in Africa\n<$D> <$B> I think it is better for Africa to experience these conflicts and then have their own internal mechanisms of solving these conflicts devoid from mechanisms imported from the Cold War patron So to me it is not bad for the democratisation process of Africa to be encumbered with these conflicts During the Cold War conflict management was done purely by the external actors like the Cold War patrons Now if the Cold War patrons can leave us alone then we can solve these conflicts as they come And as we develop that capacity the internal capacity to manage our own conflicts then in the long run I think it is in the interest of Africa\n<$?> You mentioned if the patrons of the Cold War will leave us alone What are the prospects of being left alone\n<$B> We are very optimistic that the Cold War has ended At the other end we are also very pessimistic because the end of the Cold War has not meant the end of external interference in Africa\n<$D> <$B> When two elephants fight the grass suffers And when these two elephants make love the grass still suffers So I think that that summarises the whole thing that the end of the Cold War does not mean process for Africa\n<$A> Jean Jacques When the war is over when the armed conflicts are over that's where your job starts to clean up the blood bury the dead and take the sick to hospitals \n<$C> Doctor <name/> we do not enter into the picture when war is over We are present when war is taking place in fact because the mandate of the international committee of the Red Cross is to protect and assist actual victims of armed conflicts We are present in Nigeria we are present in Somalia we are present in Rwanda We have a small delegation present in Angola We are present in South Africa Our role is to protect prisoners of war in order to treat civilian casualties in order to reunify uh families So we've been acting very much over the last twenty years in Africa in all the existent conflicts Our role is also to make them understand what rules are applicable in terms of armed conflicts\n<$A> It sounds quite quaint that instead of working full blast to stop wars you're trying to say there are orderly laws and regulations to determine how people are going to fight\n<$C> The Red Cross is an international movement It is constituted by the international committee of the Red Cross basically composed of Swiss citizens which is dealing with the protection and the assistance of uh victims of armed conflicts It's the number one element The number two element is constituted by all the national societies we have in the world more than one hundred fifty We have Kenya Red Cross Society We have the Canadian Red Cross Society We have the Pakistani Red Crescent Society And the third member of this whole family is the Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies dealing with natural disasters The Red Cross was born in war and has from the very beginnings tried to limit suffering not tried to bring peace War always exists but we need to have a presence to assist the persons that are suffering because of the conflict We leave that the fact of peace-keeping negotiation *naviation> conflict resolution to the United Nations\n<$A> And then you begin to train the soldiers\n<$C> Well we begin to train the soldiers concerning the application of the rules to be applied in warfare\n<$A> What are these\n<$C> We have international conventions to protect the victims of armed conflict We call them the Geneva Conventions Geneva Conventions are four The First Geneva Convention is to protect the wounded personnel in the battlefield be they civilians or military persons The second one takes as uh a protection category the victims of war at sea The Third Geneva Convention deals with prisoners of war and the Fourth Convention with the civilian population Those conventions in fact ask the governments ask the soldiers ask the fighting parties to take all the necessary steps to respect the persons that are not any longer combatants Civil personnel is not a combatant These are the rules that we try to train and teach to the soldiers\n<$A> What has been the overall picture in Africa Has there been much compliance with the rules Often when there are combatants they consider one another enemies and you're saying let's protect the wounded The combatant will say exterminate\n<$C> We have started some specific programmes started in the military public some years ago Many of the violations committed in the field were because these laws were not known I do not refute the fact that sometimes those laws are known and are violated In fact ICRC has as a main mandate to protect the civil victims but it is also the promoter of international humanitarian law \n<$D> <$C> This is the main problem of all international public law International public law does not have any mechanism for its enforcement This is the difference with national laws But we have I would say some mechanisms nevertheless that are underway to be created The United Nations General Assembly decided to take seriously violations crude violations of international military law and set up an international tribunal to decide upon punishment for the persons that have committed war crimes\n<$A> How much of that training have you done in Africa\n<$C> We started in nineteen eighty-eight and so far we have been giving more than fifty national courses covering more than thirty countries and seventeen regional seminars covering forty-six countries It means that we have for the time being had as students more than two thousand senior officers from all the African armed forces This is going to be boosted by a Pan-African programme we're going to have in Kenya in Nairobi from six to ten December nineteen ninety-three in collaboration with the Organisation of African Unity\n<$A>How about the training materials\n<$C> First of all we have a very simple document here The rules for behaviour in combat It makes a very short summary of these rules to be implemented by soldiers in the battlefield concerning combat rules concerning how a wounded enemy has to be treated concerning the treatment given to prisoners of war Then for officers we have a handbook on the law of war for the armed forces This handbook is a summary of the four Geneva Conventions and additional protocols and includes also what we call the conduct of hostility treatment We started to produce a teaching file that give the possibility to any officer having attended our course to give lectures to officers\n<$A> War as far as we know is about hatred It's about hostility And here you come in and say be kind to the enemy when you capture How easy is this for our soldiers They're fighting really hard to exterminate\n<$A> Here is this religious idea that when he has shot you in the leg\n<$C> Exactly\n<$A> and you capture them don't bayonet them\n<$C> It's extremely difficult to train soldiers to kill and then tell them be kind with your enemy This teaching has to be given by officers This teaching is not a question of free will It has to be integrated into the chain of command It is a question of order and discipline for the soldier to respect those rules because those rules are laws and those laws are accepted by the states And so the states in deciding to accept those treaties accept also to implement it to the last of the soldiers So this is why we have all the system of implementing measures down the chain of command that gives us the result for a soldier that does not respect those rules facing a tribunal facing military justice for having committed a war crime\n<$D> <$C> Even last century the picture were not so nice as it might seem Gentleman-war is maybe more a theory than something we have faced in the past in practice I agree with you that reality in the field does not always correspond to the the facts to the international treaties which still have a good long way to go Now these international treaties have been created and accepted by states ICRC is just the promoter We have on the one side the law It has to be implemented Sometimes it is but when it is implemented correctly nobody says a word about it On the other hand it's that we have a lot of violations in the field ICRC starts to be very vocal because we cannot continue to accept those very evident violations But the international community starts also to realize that we have to impose with more I would say forceful means to respect those international treaties So maybe let's go back in twenty years to see the progress\n<$A> Robert you said earlier that uh the military related problems that Africa encounters today are the result of the absurd socio-economic policies forced on us What are these\n<$D> <$A> Models like what\n<$D> <$A> Is there no way counting on the experience gained elsewhere that they can leapfrog some of these many years you're talking about\n<$D> \n<$A> What's special about Malaysia\n<$D> \n<$A> That's where the pressure comes in You have the donor saying do it this way do it this way And Philip is saying if the pressure was eased off a little Africa might be able to evolve her own ways of resolving these problems \nS1BDIS2K\n<$B> So are you not confusing issues\n<$A> Maybe Dr Orata\n<$C> You have said correct me that there is a duplication in our house that is true but you must realise one thing that there is no provision in the university for the registration of a trade union That is one thing which the public also has got to understand that there is no provision for the registration of a trade union in the University of Nairobi or any other\n<$A> for academic staff or for anybody else\n<$C> for academic staff and those on the academic scale\n<$B> Does that preclude them from registering \n<$C> Let me finish let me finish first Now you've raised a very uh pertinent question in that you are trying to really ask why do why were we registered in the first place and these people are also fighting for the same thing So that trade union business comes in The second issue that the association cannot negotiate for salaries the second issue that the association cannot negotiate for salaries I find thatRRR that uh uh statement a little bit amorphous in the sense that take for example the management in a company They do have their salaries reviewed that is agreed isn't it and the management members are not *unionisable> members in a company So who provokes the adjustment of their salaries So what we are saying is that it doesn't matter whether you are dealing with a union or what there must be a mutual agreement If the employer and the association agree to negotiate yes to negotiate the terms and services If there is a mutual agreement in other words for example in this particular case there's a mutual understanding based on the university acts that the council recognises the Staff Association as association representing members of the academic staff so it can get and talk with these people and talk in terms of salaries So that business of uh it's only the union who can negotiate for a salary it is in general true but there are actually exceptions to that which is the salary structure I've given you for companies and so forth\n<$B> Professor Ndetei you have quoted that uh you seem to value the academic uh freedom more than you value democratic rights But uh in our constitution the National Constitution states uh clearly that uh all both of them are guaranteed in our are guaranteed there and any other statute like the one we are quoting the university act nineteen eighty-five or any other of universities is secondary to the I mean to the constitution Now what the uh members of the union are saying or seem to be saying is that they have certain rights which need to be there And this is the reason why we finally assume there is a power struggle in the university with the problem of registering having the two Is there any problem of having the union and the Association\n<$D> Listen Freedom of association is provided for and that's why we have formed this association And that association must be within the provision of the law When you talk about association freedom of of association freedom to do what That must be subject to the freedoms of other people You cannot form an association of the uh thugs because you agree you got a common trade I'm not calling anybody thugs please don't get me wrong uh or an association of people to smuggle smugglers uh just because you have the same trade okay You cannot do that It's an association to do what That's what's the matter what That's what matters But if is an association to express freely ideas and to associate freely who is telling them that association\n<$B> In essence\n<$D> But then when you Please just go and look at the union the objective of the unions of a union and then we can start from there That objective of taking over private universities\n<$A> And can we\n<$D> Go and look at the union so that when we talk we talk about things that are objective That is one of the  objectives really Somebody who has invested so much the Catholic University the United States University which is the here the <name/> University Baraton University private property and somebody wants to takes over that \n<$C> I've read uh uh those rules and I've never not seen that clause saying that the union wants to take over All they have said is that they want to members from all the universities both public and private but now let's bring it back to the basics Now the union has said that if it can co-exist with you because you are an association and you don't have the clout to negotiate for salaries Are you prepared to co-exist with it\n<$D> Okay now first of all uh before we answer whether we have the clout or not there is something which you need to get cleared and the public also needs to understand that An interpretation of the constitution of WASU they say that they will take charge of Kenyatta University and its constituent colleges Moi University and its constituent colleges Nairobi University and its constituent colleges and Egerton University and its constituent colleges private and religious universities and any university formed later on in this country\n<$A> I think the issue here is that uh since you are registered how what are your membership at the moment\n<$D> Well so far we are uh busy recruiting members Uh we have a base membership of about really five fifty officially uh\n<$A> How many\n<$D> fifty people who've really registered officially but we are still uh still selling the Academic Association amongst members of the academic staff We have not given a deadline as to when you can register or not so that we would really say this is not it all But shortly we are going to start taking a count stock of how many people we have as members\n<$A> Does it mean that uh these the members are not I mean the university lecturers and the senior academic staff are not enthusiastic in joining this organisation because when I There used to be uh the register for WASU it had about a lot of members say five hundred six hundred members and now you are saying that you have only fifty Is it not that you are not getting popular\n<$D> No it is not a question of uh the popularity One you have to look at the time span Secondly these are people who are now officially committing their salaries for deduction and when it comes to that kind of uh kind ofRRR uh decision you don't really expect this decision We are going to be deducting money from these people's uh uh pay-packets So at that point really we don't really feel that there's a problem in terms of the speed with which we are picking up So we want everybody to decide his own free will that he's going to be a member and he knows that there are certain conditions which are going on with that particular membership\n<$C> Okay I think as you're from the University of Nairobi which has been paralysed by the strikes since November and there being now members committee members of that association what are you doing to contain that situation\n<$D> Very good uh We are appealing to all members of staff to put the needs of the students those poor students who pay six thousand shillings and they come from very poor family backgrounds We are appealing on behalf of the parents we are appealing on behalf of the Kenya Community for members of staff to put the interest of those students first and foremost Let's go back and teach and while we are teaching we can then negotiate about those other issues uh As far as the registration is concerned or the union is concerned it's not within us It is for the people who are agitating for the registration of the union to convince those people who register the union To register them is not for us But in the meantime shall we go back and teach and think about those students think about those parents the thousands of students their parents and their independence That is the focus now over and above our personal interests\n<$A> Uh Doctor Ndetei I mean Professor Ndetei the University of Nairobi since it opened it started opening its various campuses on uh January ten It seems that uh nothing has been going on and now the students have started going home Now we understand that only less than a third now of the cohort that was called in there is at the university now What is your association doing to let the students stay in the campus and also to ensure that uh something is going on not just to keep them there as farce it's like being hostages\n<$D> Some of us are teaching I've just come from teaching and the students wanted me to teach them And there are many students there are many students who want to be taught There are very many members of staff who want to be who want to teach But what is happening We are seeing *thuggery> The other time we had uh four professor principals being beaten up for thirty minutes Are those the people we want to deal with So because of *thuggery>\n<$A> We are going to have one last question uh maybe from uh Mr Muyia\n<$B> yes I'm just want for a conclusion just to say that your association is fairly uh like a <O/> bulldog because in the first place if you cannot bring your members of the professional staff the academic staff to teach at this critical moment when the government needs your support most\n<$D> We are asking those people who are applying *thuggery> to people who want to teach to give the members of staff the freedom of choice to teach if they want to teach without *thuggery> We don't want to see what we saw the other day somebody is being beaten up We don't want to see uh organisations meant to flush people out of lecture theatres We want them to say the choice is yours go and teach if you want to teach but if you don't want to teach uh that is your business We are not going to apply anything else other than verbal persuasion\n<$A> Thank you very much I'm sorry we have to come to an end I think uh we've run out of time I would have wished to continue Our viewers we have come to the end of our programme tonight I'd like uh to uh appreciate your being with us and following uh this interesting debate I think uh the time is a little too short but uh we will look for another forum to exploit that I'd like to thank uh our two visiting university dons Dr Duke Orata who is the chairman of the Academic Staff Association of the University of Nairobi and uh Professor David Ndetei who is a committee member I would want also to thank our panellist Mr Wachira Kigotho of the Standard I'm Wamayiu Muhia from the Daily Nation And with that our viewers I wish you a good night", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source':

{'text': "P.W. 1 ON OATH:\nI am called <name/>. I work with Price Water House as a director in the auditing company. I am one of the owners of the company. Our office is at Loton Building Koinenga street. We deal with Danida as Financial Consultants who are financial  aiders> to the Government. Their office is at H.F.C.K. Building. They have a project in Kitui called the Kitui Integrated Development Programme. They (Danida) send money to the Kenya office who pass the finance to the Kitui office and in co-ordination of the Kenya Government development is done, with the money the project involves Water Sector conservation agriculture and  afforestation>. They work in collaboration with live stock development, Agriculture, Arid and <foreign/>Semi-arid lands and Water Development. As a financial consultants we do not deal with exactly how they plan their activities but I know they have field officers I work in collaboration of Government officers. In May 1992 the field officer (Kitui) became aware of financial irregularities and sought for police to investigate the irregularities ie on the field officers his appropriating the filed money. There were two stages of investigations. They were saying about One million shillings could have been misappropriated or even more. Our task was to confirm whether one million they suspected was misappropriated or much more. I concluded the investigations and end of July and June I discovered one million and over had been misappropriated. This is audit report. Report MFI one. I confirmed that 1.043 million had been misappropriated from July 1991.\nAll the above totals are 558,527/= they all relate to the activities carried out in respect of the Ministry of Agriculture. Next is a list of items carried out in respect of the Ministry of Livestock Development. Three specific items were a voucher of October 1991 relating to purchases of medicines and medical  valities> from Dawa pharmaceutical 20,567/= the voucher describes what was purchased as subject leaders. We are aware that Dawa pharmaceutical does not sell surgical needles. On that basis we concluded that this was a fraudulent transaction. It was an invoice used to support a train by the land. The 2nd voucher is of 046 of October 1991 of 50,000/=. This is the voucher which is meant to account to the Government the money taken by the account number. It was for purchase of vaccines from Kyoso Division. In order to show he has spent all money he was to submit documentation ie vouchers to support expenditure. In this case we found the expenditure was supported by a Government official receipt number 778788 dated 22.8.91. The arguments was that a government receipt is not a valid receipt to support the expenditure. No one would expect the invoice to be from the supplier. So on that basis we did not accept the receipt as legal supporting document for the expenditure and no explanation given we concluded the money was fraudulently spent. Voucher 046 - MFI 2 receipt number 778788 MFI 3. I see this photocopy of a receipt shows the amount to be 10/= only. It is dated 26.9.91 photocopy MFI 4 certified as a true copy of the original.\nInvestigation concluded at the end of July and we submitted our report to Davida at the same time with advice that action be taken through lawyers and if necessary involve the police. MFI 1 referred to the name on the voucher is <name/> Designation Veterinary officer. The money was for purchase of vaccines for Kyose Division and refers the official receipt to be No. 778788 which is the same number as MFI 3.\nI copied the report involving 5 ministries named earlier. I have signed it and I wish to produce the same as exhibit in court. Exhibit 1. The information in the report was out of interviews of project management observed documentation in the management office in that David office and in cases needed explanation. We spoke to project officer concerned. I examined all documents relating to the report. They are with the intul management.\nP.W. 1 cross-examined by counsel:\nI have officers who work with me. I delegate the interviews of the accused to my officer and so did the interview to the Dawa Pharmaceuticals. I copied the report out that we did as a team. I have never seen the accused but my officers have. They were 3 members of the team but I cannot remember which of one of them did. I personally did not deal with the documents. I have seen them before. They were presented to me for review. Yes I copied MFI 4 and MFI 3. The prosecutor asked me the number and I read and so did he as in the date. I did the information on the two documents is not the same. Yes my officers visited Kyoso. I never dealt with Davida for 4 years. I was dealing with this project for the first time. The report was made to me by Davida officer at Nairobi. I interviewed the project co-ordinator supervisor and the administration supervisor. We do not investigate people we investigate documents. We were looking at the activities in Davida  inful>. It is in the objectives of the investigations as earlier stated (reads out). We worked at the whole project. Yes we doubted the expenditure of Kshs. 50,000/= because a government receipts would not have been issued to account for an expenditure. The money was never spent therefore. Whatever is indicated in the receipt could not have been brought. I was never given an explanation of reimbursement. If that happened there would be documentation from the supplier and then debits of sending sales if does. This would have been done by the project management and then doctor<name/>. We asked for the same. They never had these documents. I have not dealt with this documents. It does not relate to MFI 3 or 4. This account is signed for by the programme officer. I was not to find out whether they had an internal auditor. I interviewed the people who signed the and learnt they acted on the receipts produced - MFI 3. Yes we are aware Dawa Pharmaceuticals does not sell syringes and needles. I was using all the knowledge I had which I did. As of the time of investigations in June 1992 I sent an officer to go and interview officers at Dawa Pharmaceuticals. I can supply the name of the officer I sent to Dawa Pharmaceuticals. Yes I know some items are brought at Dawa Pharmaceuticals. They are ie vaccines they were regular customers of Dawa Pharmaceuticals. Yes <name/> was interviewed. He is a chief accountant. Also <name/> a cashier. Validity of MFI 3 was brought by my officers but I do not know who wrote this receipt. So many officers were interviewed This is not what I wrote in this report. I did not rely on the Davida office to make my report. We found these documents in their office\nP.W. 2 ON OATH:\nI am called <name/>. I work at the D.C.'s office Kitui as a district officer. My work includes receiving revenue and paying customers. I am the only cashier. The Government Official receipt books are in safe. I keep them if not in use. They are issued to me by an accountant. I do sign for them when I get them. Before paying the claim we identify the payees and then we pay them. We do have authorising officers before we pay. When recording the money we receive the money and issue receipts for the books. I even cheques the procedure is the same. When an individual comes to pay in person we receive the money and issue the receipt to the payee. The official receipts shows the amount surrendered. MFI 3 is a receipt. I came across it when I was shown to me by the CID officers last year. He asked if I issued the receipt I told them I never issued the receipt.

I also go on leave. I know the accused before court. He was working with the veterinary department. He has never visited me but would come to my office for normal vouchers or payments.\nP.W. 2 on oath cross-examined by counsel:\nI was not issued with a receipt book with the above serial numbers.

By then we had a campaign for Kyuso Division so we might have taken them directly there. Later *sweties> in a Mutiso I cannot remember I saw IP Nguli claiming they were not bought and the receipt was made out by the person who was saying he bought the things. I recorded my statement with IP Nguli. I said I did not receive the things. I was shown a photocopy of a receipt. This is not the photocopy. It was a receipt from Dawa Pharmaceuticals.

{'text': "1st P.W. <name/> P/M A/S\nI am employed by Kenya Green Growers Union as a subordinate staff and attached to Mombassa. My duty is office messenger work. I am charged with duties of cleaning offices manually.\nMy manager <name/> in February, 1991 asked me to supervise the loading fertilizers in  transporters> lorries which fertilizer was to be transported to Nairobi. We had Amana Transporters, and Bayusuf Transporters. The loading was at confined warehouse at Sangamwe. I was assigned the duty of supervising loading and writing out deliveries. My deliveries had originals and duplicates. Originals were white and duplicates yellow in colour. In the deliveries I record the truck number, drivers name, drivers identity card, quantities of the fertilizer and the driver was required to sign the delivery. I used to ask the driver how many tons his lorry is authorised, to carry. He would tell me then I would work out what quantity he was supposed to carry. It was D.A.P. fertilizer.\nThe fertilizer was packed in bags each of 50 kg. I would write the delivery and the driver would take both deliveries. The driver would then carry the fertilizer from confined warehouse, then he would transport it to Nairobi. The driver brings the fertilizer to Nairobi and gives the receiving clerk both delivery notes. The delivery clerk check the fertilizer to agree the number of the bags in the lorry with the number of bags shown on the delivery. If there is shortage or damages, the receiving clerk indicates the shortage or damages on both delivery notes. Then the duplicate is send back to our shipping office of KGGCU in Mitchel Cotts building (Wit. shown delivery notes). Yes, I wrote out these delivery notes. This delivery note is No. 228878 dated 1.3.91 for 660 bags by 50 kg of D.A.P. Amana  transporter> vehicle No. KVH 339 ZA5577. In this delivery note original shows that 31 bags were damaged but the duplicate shows 21 were damaged (original marked Mfl 1(a) and duplicate marked Mfl 1(b). The  transporter> writes his own delivery while I am writing out my deliveries. I am with the  transporters'>' clerk who writes out his own delivery. In this one the clerk to Amana wrote out his own delivery notes which is this one (marked Mfl 1(c) ) which delivery shows the same details as my delivery shows the same details as my delivery note. Mfl 1(c) shows 31 bags were damaged. Amana  Transporter> had sole contracted Star  Transporter> who also had his own delivery note. This Mfl 1(d) shows 21 bags had been damaged. This is the 2nd delivery note which is No. 228879 dated 1.3.91, vehicle KYL 984 ZA 9725, 840 bags DAP by 50 kg damaged as per original 44 bags (marked Mfl 2(a) the duplicate shows 14 damaged (marked Mfl 2(b).\nAmana  Transporter> delivery (marked Mfl 2(c) shows 44 damaged. The subcontractor star transport delivery note (marked Mfl 2(d) show 44 bags damaged.\nI am the one who wrote out all the above delivery notes. In each of them the m.v. Reg. Number, the driver's name, his ID/Card and the name of  transporters> name are recorded and each driver has signed each delivery note. At Nairobi and the receiving clerk signs the delivery note at the space (signature of the recipient and the official rubber stamp) space. In each of the delivery note it is signed by the receiving clerk and the rubber stamp KGGCU Nairobi Kenya Ltd. I don't know what happens to the damaged fertilizer. I don't know the clerk who was receiving the fertilizer at Nairobi. The receiving clerk at Nairobi records the amount of fertilizer damaged or missing.\nXxd by <name/>: I am attached to Mombassa KGGCU as a messenger. I agree we have other officers in our Mombassa office. We have clerks. We have managers in Mombassa office. At material time we had shortage of staff as we had a lot of work and this is why I was assigned this job. There were many lorries. I was writing out delivery notes supervising that the goods were loaded in the lorry. We had warehouse clerks and gate keeper also who were checking that the correct load was put into the lorry. I have over three years service. That was the only time I was asked to do this job. I agree every year we receive fertilizers. I agree I was not given the job of follow-up as there were other staff who do that job. The  transporters> had their own duplicate delivery. The warehouse clerks had tally sheet. The tally sheet are not in court.\n<name/>: There are very many documents which have been marked as Ex. and I need time to peruse them and get instructions. I ask for adjournment.\nPros: No objection. We need four days. We have very long witness from Mombassa and other towns and we have a lot of documents to deal with.\nCourt: We have not finished even one witness. This is a very long case with witness from Mombassa and other town and a lot of documents are involved. We need at least four days p/s.\nOrder: B/E for accused to go to court one on 15.5.92 for fresh hearing date.\nP.W. I Recalled S/S\nXxd by <name/> (Cont.) On arrival in Nairobi the goods would be received by the receiving clerks who would indicate damages or shortages on the deliveries. There is inter-office communications document called KGGCU 14. The damages and loss or shortage must be recorded on the delivery. He could also record the same on KGGCU 14. I have heard about KGGCU 58. I do clerical job at times but in a small way. I don't know KGGCU 58 form. The receiving clerk must raise claim form for the damaged and shortages but I am not sure. I know the  transporters> pay for damages and shortages so the cost of damaged and lost bags is deducted from their transport payments. The  transporter> is given a copy of delivery so that he can claim transport costs (Wit. shown Mfl 32(a),(b) and (c)).\nOn Mfl 32(a) four bags are shown as damaged\nOn Mfl 32(b) four bags are shown as damaged\nOn Mfl 32(c) four bags are shown as damaged.\nThere are no alterations on any of Mfl 32(a), 32(b) and 32(c).\n(witness shown Mfl 15(a), 10(a))\nI can see this Mfl 10(c) and I can see a signature there and even on 10(b) I can see a signature. The signature belongs to the  transporter> M/s Amana. I can see Mfl 15(b) and 15(c) and 19(b) and 19(c) are also signed by the  transporters> after receiving them from the drivers. I don't know why  transporters> sign these form.\nRe-xd by pros: I don't know at what stage the  transporter> signs these documents.\n2nd P.W. X/M S/S\nMy name is <name/>. I am employed by Kenya Green Growers Coop. Union and attached to Mombassa depot. I am employed as a clerk. I am attached to shipping office at Kilindini. My main duty is receiving invoices, from  transporters> or any other clearing agent. I also check invoices and I make payments for the claims. I know P.w. 1. He is my  workmate>. He is attached to Baraki Godown. After our goods fertilizers are delivered into our up-country depots the depot sign the documents that is delivery notes. They indicate if they have received all the goods in the delivery note and if there is shortage or damages they would indicate on the delivery note. There are three copies of the delivery notes. The first which is white is left with the receiving branch. The 2nd copy which is yellow in colour is returning to us the sending depot. The 3rd copy which is white is the book copy. I am the one who receive the yellow copy. I check the copy and make payment to the  transporters> (write them cheques). If there is shortages I deduct the value of the damages or shortage from the payment to the  transporter>. I receive yellow copy attached to the invoice from  transporter>. We prepare a schedules showing the remarks which have been made on the yellow copies. After payments we retain the delivery yellow copy and the invoices. I know KGGCU 14 which is a memo.\nThis has nothing to do with delivery notes. This KGGCU 14 is written by the receiving depot and it shows damages or shortages. The receiving branch sends us the KGGCU 14 direct and the yellow copy of the delivery note is given by the receiving branch to the  transporter> who brings it to us with his transport invoice so we check if the yellow copy of delivery note agrees with the KGGCU 14 details then we pay. If the delivery note disagree with KGGCU 14 we make enquiries from the receiving depot and we can't pay till the clarification is done. KGGCU 58 is a form used by receiving depot to confirm the total of fertilizers delivered to them and the damages and shortages it is send to us direct by the receiving branch.\nKGGCU 15 is our delivery notes which I have referred to above. I agree fertilizers was delivered to Nairobi from our Mombassa offices. I received all the invoices concerning this case. I can see these documents. Among them I received our delivery notes KGGCU 15 and  transporters> invoices. I have checked through Mfl to Mfl 13 which are here and I confirm that I am the one who received all the delivery notes and invoices from the  transporter>. I did not sign or indicate anywhere that I am the one who received them but I signed the  transporters> copy of his invoice to indicate that I had received his invoice and the yellow copy of our delivery notes. KGGCU 14 is an internal memo which is sent by the receiving depot so as to show how many bags they have received and how many were damaged. I don't reflect the cheques issued on the delivery notes, or invoice from  transporters>; but we prepare a schedule of what we have paid to the  transporter> and the shortage and damages. <name/> is the one who prepares the schedule showing payments. I don't know the  transporter>.\nXxd by <name/>: I am a general clerk. P.w. 1 works as a subordinate staff. He cleans the  godown> and works as a messenger.

We are eight clerks in the office. I can't tell why the manager assigned p.w. 1 a subordinate staff this work. We claim damages from the insurance company. We deduct damages from the  transporters>. I agree from Mfl 1 to 13 there are no shortages but only damages. I agree I am the one who received the yellow copies of the delivery notes. Before making payment I inform the manager about damages so that he can claim the damages. I agree the receiving office must raise the claim. The manager must sign the claim forms. I am not aware if the claim for damages was raised. We don't charge the  transporter> for damages but shortages. Nairobi depot retain original of the delivery notes and they send the duplicate copy. The receiving clerk raises KGGCU 14 showing the damaged bags and the shortages. The KGGCU 58 also confirm losses and damages. I am not aware of rechecking the fertilizer. We receive copies of invoices from  transporters>. We have not brought KGGCU 14 in court NO KGGCU 58. I don't know why these documents have not been brought to court.

{'text': "P. W. I <name/> M/A/S STATES:\nI am employed by Nairobi City Commission. My duties as a sergeant. I am attached to Investigation offices to check on Nairobi City Commission properties. On 4.4.91 I was around Muindi Mbingu and Moktar Daddah street at around 11.00 p.m. and I was on patrol when I sighted two city commission workers, one is a mechanic (first accused identified) and 2nd accused <name/> is a city <ea/>Askari the first accused was removing coins from the parking metre and putting it in his pockets. The 2nd accused was with him. I became suspicious and I hide myself and waited to see what to do and I waited and I saw Accused I move to a other metres and I saw them remove money from one metre to another and pocketed it. I trailed then to Moktar Daddah street. Accused I then removed money from the other parking metre and I saw the lady move away and I confronted her and she came and I held both of them. I detained them and I asked the lady accused 2 and asked her why she was seeing accused I take money and she was not doing anything. On the way accused I pleaded with me but I refused and took them to my boss where accused I was asked what he had and he said he had only 10/= he was using for testing the metres and the boss insisted he removed everything and we asked him to remove his uniform and we recovered Kshs. 96/= from him. They were silver coins. They are this ones (MBI I). We then took them to Central police station. When the mechanics are repairing the metres was to be accompanied by the City <ea/>Askari like accused I and accused 2. After they repair the money in that metre should be returned.\nCross-examined by the defence:\nI have enough experience in the metre system set up. I also trained partly. There are 2 keys to a metre. They are both for opening the metre. I did not ascertain about the keys in possession of the accused I. The 2nd accused acts as a guard. I did not receive a complain from Accused 2. Accused I was dressed in a dust coat on top of his clothing. The dust coat is to repair the metre. If the metre is full you move to the next metre. If one finds the metre is full one only takes up the excess and put it in the next metre. It is not possible that all the metres opened by the accused were full and being emptied. If a mechanic finds there are foreign elements in the metres he has to repair the metre and if the it is stuck money, he repairs the metre and returns the money. I cannot recall whether the dust coat was opened or closed. I think it was opened. The dust coat had the tools. I ascertained some metres were working. They were 20 metres and he repaired all and they were functioning. I did not take a key from <name/> (accused I) when I arrested him. He removed it in my boss's office.\nCross-examined by defence counsel for accused 2:\nI have been in City Commission for all over 20 years. I have known the accused for 3 years. I was not in uniform. The money from the metres are collected everyday. The mechanics are assigned where to work everyday. I did not only suspect but I observed what I have said. I held the 2nd accused as I thought she was escaping from the street where they were removing the money. A search was done but the 2nd accused had no money. The mechanic was to be given 5/= in maximum while leaving for duty. Both  accused were not doing their work and I was not hasty and suspicious. I found money in accused I's pocket. It was from the metre.\nRe-examination:\nI watched the behaviours of the  accused for a period of 30 minutes. I saw Accused I remove money from the metres and putting in the dust coat and his pockets. He was to return the stuck money in the repaired metre. I first arrested the lady few yards away from the man.\nI have other witnesses but are not in court.\nCOURT:\nThe case is adjourned and sent to court number I for Re-allocation on 6.8.91\nD. W.

{'text': "P.W.I Adult male Xtian sworn states in English\nMy name is <name/>. I work with the Ministry of Commerce Department of  Intermalt> joint boards section. My duties include Inspection of Joint loan boards, I have been in that section since 1982. Other than inspection I am also responsible for analysing financial statements and other matters regarding joint loan boards. I receive the financial reports from the field ie the final accounts and quarterly reams which are received 4 times in a year, Ist quarter 31/March, 2nd quarter 30/June, 3rd quarter 30/September, 4th quarter 31/December, each year. In total we have 46 loan boards in the country are established by the Minister for Local Government under S. 104 cap 265 Laws of Kenya, and one of the functions of those units is to issue loans for trade purposes in their areas of operations, each board has a membership of a  chartimen> who is normally the District Commissioner of that area, a secretary who is the District Trade Development officer of that area, 3 members appointed by the Minister and 3 members appointed by the Local authority of that area, what or trader wishes to apply for a trade loan he does so on a prescribed form it is form CIT 220 while being completed and all answers in the form are completed, the applicant forwards that form to the secretary whose function includes vetting that applicant when the applications are vetted and the secretary gives his recommendations and views about the particulars applicant the secretary is expected and is required to call a board meeting to consider the application and also consider the recommendation of the secretary as regards that applicant so as to call that board meeting the secretary is required to give a notice of such meeting for a period of not less than seven days so as a quorum to be joined at least 3 members of the board must be present to join it. Out of the 3 members one of the members must be a member appointed by the Minister Administrative the department insists that at least 14 days notice must be given so that the permanent secretary commerce is represented at the meeting policy matters have to be discussed during that meeting which include among others approving of trade loans. At the time of calling the board meeting the secretary is expected to circulate the items of agenda to be discussed during that meeting the same copies must be substituted to the permanent secretary commerce. The District trade Development officer receives and  vetts> application for loans and he is also the treasurer to that particular board, under that portfolio he issues all the loans to the successive applicants he is also responsible for receiving the loan repayments. He is expected to maintain books to accounts and he is also expected to prepare financial statements and to account for the money that he receives after banking such money into the official bank account. He is also the supervisor of the  supertive> staff. In the process of vetting the applicant revisits the applicants premises and also discusses with the financial issues. The provincial trade development officer is an ex-officio member of these boards. Nobody is eligible unless approved by a properly convened board meeting. On 22.11.88 I accompanied with <name/> who was then my immediate boss and the Deputy District of internal trade to Isiolo to inspect the Isiolo joint loan board and investigate general his management of the Isiolo inside office, resulting from reports that had reached the headquarters from general complaints by both members of the public and also the staff members.\n(Witness: can I refer to my report because it is about 4 years old).\nCourt Proceed.\nP.W.I continues, consequently to the visit I discovered that out of the loan received a total of Kshs. 22,449/80 had not been accounted for. Also confirmed that there was an  wint> agreement between the accused and 3 loan defaulters who owed the board a total of 22,299/. A total of Kshs. 47,000 had been issued out to 4 people without the boards authority it was also discovered that the accused had issued Kshs. 25,000/= as trade loans to two unqualified people. On return to Nairobi a letter was written to the permanent Secretary giving the details of who had been discovered and the permanent secretary was requested to take any disciplinary action seemed fit. It was signed by Mr. <name/> the deputy director of internal trade it was not issued to the permanent secretary it was put away and the matter restored there. Later on it was discovered that on the statutory period of notice of meeting had not been given but 2 days notice had been given instead and the board convened administratively after every board meeting the secretary is required to prepare minutes of that particular meeting and circulate such minutes and a copy must be forwarded to the Accounting officer who is the permanent secretary commerce as soon as possible. Accused as soon as possible is interpreted to be 14 days after such a board meeting. The board meeting held on 2.6.89 minutes had not been received at the headquarters as of 26/90. So on 26.3.90 I was instructed to make yet another visit to the Isiolo trade office so as to inspect for a second time Isiolo district joint loan board. Among my inspection I was to verify details of the meeting held on 2.6.89. On arrival I was given some of the documents included 2 lists of approved loan applicants. The 1st list had 12 names who were to receive a total of 103,000/=. Among them there were 4 names that had been issued with loans. Prior to the meeting they were <name/> No.3. for Kshs. 10,000/= trading at Nyati Market. The second <name/> alleging trading in Township to receive Kshs. 12,000/=. <name/> of model Gashe market to receive 5,000/=. The list one was <name/> of Township to receive 15,000/=. The list MFI I. The second list taken in 1990 the accused person was transferred from Isiolo to Nairobi headquarters and another officer was posted there to take over the functions of the secretary and treasurer of Isiolo joint loan board. Accused it was only then that the minutes of 2.6.89 were received at my office which included a list of approved applicants who were in total 40 in number to receive a total of Kshs. 410,000/= among the 40 applicants in the 2nd list included <name/>.\n<name/> appearing as No. 5 and No. 39 on the list under 39 she was referred to as <name/> to receive 15,000/= under No. 5 the same applicant was to receive Kshs. 12,000/=. There were anomalies because we would not have had 2 different lists for the same board meeting I produce the list as MFI I. When I found the list the cheques had already been paid and so I went to bank and requested for the cheques they were 24 in number including cheque No. 136626 paid to <name/> drawn on 5.2.90 for Kshs. 15,000/= cleared by Barclays Bank Isiolo branch on 13.3.90. At the back of this cheque it had been endorsed to one Mr. <name/> behind it a signature and ID card No. 5548868/69. Then account 1058329 it was later discovered that the endorsed person was the District special branch officer, Isiolo District marked MFI 2.\nCross examined by Accused:\nI found the section in 1982. Prior to this I was at Busia Trade office. I became a trade officer in 1979. I had worked with Home affairs, office of the president East Africa customs and before this I was a treasurer of and a holder of CPA Certificate. We were a loan scheme return and had drawn of the receipts. Accused from 2 for loans issued form 3 is a ledger account noting defaults in repayment. These are prepared by the trade office. Yes I have been a trade officer in various stations. Yes I used to prepare those reports. The board is chaired by the District commissioner, 3 members appointed by the Minister but delegated to the PS and the Secretary recommends the people to the Chairman and particulars are sent to one PS i.e. name, qualifications, profession and standing in the community. And the DS vets and  apprents> from the recommended. Yes they must have acquired some standard of education. I have never come across an illiterate member of the board. An applicant approaches the trade office gives particulars of his trade within the locality and how he intends to use the form. He is issued with a form which he gives and the trade officer is that with the form. He then visits the business. The visit can be trade by the officers under the trade officer. Livestock traders can be considered. Yes it was considered a trade at the time they were in Isiolo. There is a schedule of the particulars of the applicant and purpose of issuing the loan. There is a vetting guide. Accused if he is a livestock trader then you indicate it in the vetting guide. The vetting guide forms part of the applicants file. You do not disburse the cheques until the minute are verified. I duly know of the meeting of 2.6.89 when you were in Isiolo. The list produced is the one from the meeting of 2.6.89. The procedure is to circulate before the meeting. In an agenda for considering loans. You must have a list of recommended names of the applicants, the recommended amount, the security supplied and the purpose of the loan, and the market place. The board is supposed to discuss and decide. As the secretary you give reasons for recommending or rejecting or pending the decision. The list is there approved and as the secretary you prepare the minutes and dispatch it and await approval. The secretary is the first signatory and the district commissioner is the 2nd signatory. The members are either to the minutes so as to confirm them. Before you issue the cheques, you are supposed to have all the files of the applicant i.e. App. form vetting guide recommendation of the secretary. The secretary normally the committee issues on understanding to register the interest of the particular board. The DC is the chairman because he is the administrative authority in the area. I got the list from your office and I did not fabricate any list. I am in job group H and I don't know your job group. I am not your Junior. One of the conditions is that an approved applicant was open an account if he had none before the application. Accused the secretary has the duty to ensure that this is true before the cheque is released. All our cheques are crossed. In case you did not encourage then to open accounts then you have failed miserably because he is supposed to develop trade in that area. I was coming to Isiolo to inspect the office not you as a person. I visited there once when you were there I wrote a report on my return. The money that could not be accounted from was established from your books of account. The letter did not reach the PS and I did not know why. 1st visit was 2.11.88. 2nd visit in 1989. My report was not malicious and it is not true that I came to cut meat and I sniffed around. You should us who circulated the report. The 2.6.89 was the second board meeting. Your list has a detention of centre names (points). The unqualified people did not have business then were no securities and the names were not approved by the board. The unqualified people are <name/> and <name/>. They No. 1,3,660/ dated 22.8.89.

{'text': 'P.W. 9 SWORN AND XX. BY <name/>:-\nYes I am a supervisor but I used to work in a junior position as a postal officer. I used to deal with FB.21 documents. Before they are filled they are kept where the customer has access. They are in bundles or individually, a customer can come and be given a single form. When one is filled, they are brought to me and I immediately take to the supervisor as a postal officer. I pass them over to the supervisor in person but at City Square a messenger collects these forms and takes them to the supervisor who checks and stamps them. At City Square post office, we had two special stamps atago. In extreme cases where he is very busy, we could have a 3rd one. The supervisor keeps them under lock and key and they cannot be released to postal officers. Some stamps were withdrawn eg. one broke down and was removed. It was broken viz the handle on the side came out. I cannot tell when it started breaking. A 2nd one was withdrawn for similar reasons and we received a new one. It was between mid 1980 in the course of 1989 but they were used before the discovery of the breakage. I cannot know how many forms had been stamped with the two defective special day stamps. All parts may not come out clearly. I pointed out those that I signed for, I disagreed with those that did not pass through me. But I admitted those that passed through me. Ref: MFI-14(a) I would not know how many such documents were passed on that day of 25.10.89. They are at post bank, at the very final stage, Ref: MFI-14(e) I cannot be able to know how many more were stamped on that day. On 11.10.89, Ref: MFI-14(f), I wouldn\'t know how many other forms were passed and if they are the same or not. On 24.10.89 Ref: MFI-14(b) would not know how many were dealt with on that day, unless they were brought here for comparison some of these forms merely have a date and only a few have an initial apart from the date. I do not know whose initials they are. I wouldn\'t know all the supervisors of 1989, but I remember a few.\nI went on transfer about 12.2.89 I have used a special date stamp which does not show the details. There are obvious defects in these date stamp impressions.\nxx. by <name/>:-\nOn S.B.21 the name of the depositor, address, office code. No cheque digit amount to be withdrawn and amount in the book signatures and identification i.e. No. on ID.CARD. All these details are checked by a counter clerk and then counter checked by the supervisor. The code is the most important item and I wouldn\'t tell from which office it has emanated. Another supervisor can be there. The outgoing supervisor or officer in charge of section hands over the stamp to the incoming supervisor. The officer in charge does not have custody of the stamp. He is the other person who can have access to the stamp.\nCourt:- <name/> enters court.\nP.W.9 xx. by <name/>:- Continues.\nRef: MFI-9 it was dealt with by the officer on counter No. 16. There is no initial on the stamp and I cannot tell who approved it.\nRef: MFI- I cannot tell whose initials these are. But I knew the initials of those I worked closely with. It is a unique stamp. Irregularities would first be defected by the supervisor.\nxx. by <name/> for 3rd accused:-\nYes the special date stamp is kept under lock and key. These forms have a similar impression to a special date stamp. A genuine withdrawal form would have been completed.\nThe supervisor then checks for all details and the stamps the form for payment. Without the date stamp and initials of approval of all details, there can be no payment. Reconciliation is done at a different and later stage. I do not do  reconciliations>. I do not know if it was done in this case.\nxx.by <name/>:-\nI have worked as a counter officer for about ten years. I am fully conversant with particulars needed on these forms. A customer fills and complete the form the form and the counter men checks it ... writes ID.CARD NO. connectives of entries entered and passes it to supervisor who approves and initials it for payment and then the cashier pays it. It is not part of the duty of a counter officer to complete a form. But a counter men can only assist.\nRe-Examination:-\nThe officer in charge can handle a date stamp out only  rearely>. It is the supervisors who handle it. To be a genuine date stamp, it could have a logo, code No, and a word like "AKIBA" MM.\nP.W.10 A MALE ADULT SWORN AND STATES:-\nMy name is <name/>. I work for K.P. & Tel. at City Square as the postal superintendent. I became a superintendent in 1985. My duties are to control staff under me and supervision like checking in the pass books, etc. I also check SB 21 forms. Two of us checks them two in the morning and two in the afternoon. In 1990 we were four in total. I check the entries in the SB.21 form for entries if they are similar in the pass-book and if it is reported stolen or not. I then stamp with the day special stamp and I initial it in red ink. To- date I cannot identify the initials of other supervisors. We had 3 viz Nos. 114, 370, and 364, the two were being view at one time and one was removed from service. It was No. 570 due to its defects. Ref: MFI-5, none of these ten S.B. forms passed through my hands and none of them are initialled. They are not date stamped but have the post office stamp. The stamps thereon are similar to the ones we used but does not show the code No. But the logo is correct, they were issued on 9.2.90 Ref: MFI-4, 20 S.B. forms, they appear all to have been initialed. They all been the special date stamp. The code No. are not clear visible. The logo is similar to the ones we used and the date is 9.2.90. Ref: MIF- 6(a) and (b) none of them passed through me and they are initialled but I cannot identify the initials and are dated 24.1.90 as the date of issue. They all bear the day stamp but no code no. Ref: MFI-7, none of these forms passed through my hand. They all bear the date stamp. None of them have the code No. and are been initialled. But I cannot identify any of the initials and date of issue is 9.1.90.\nThe custody of the special date stamps is normally with the supervisors who keep them under key and lock when not in use. They are the only ones who handle the special date stamps. We work in shifts and they are the same date stamps we hand over to the incoming shifts. No other staffs other than the supervisor uses these stamps. When on duty the date stamps are only available to the 2 of us.\nI know 1st accused, 2nd accused, 6th and 7th were working under me as counter officers at one time or another.\nxx. by <name/> for 1st and 6th  accused:-\nI was working as a supervisor who is none or less like a superintendent. The two ranks are the same. No. 370 was bad we discovered when it could not give any code impressions on S.B.21 forms. I cannot tell which date but it was sometimes in January, 1990. No it was not after the complaints, we the supervisors discovered that it was not putting the code No. Its me who discovered and I noted it in my diary. The filed  daries> are kept in the store. I last saw it when I was at the counter sometime in January, 1990. I did not tell the police that. Yes, if a special stamp cannot produce a code No, code Nos, cannot appear in these S.B.21 forms. We do stamp it on a form. The moment it was discovered, it was not in use. It was only one that was removed from circulation. Ref. MFI-10 has special stamp and initials and the code No. is not visible a dot, i.e. heavy ink. We do not have a dot in our special stamps. The dot is in place of a code No. They are not visible those dots are all in all the forms. They are just marks when the special stamps were discovered to be defective, they were withdrawn immediately. They are marks, these stamps were being kept by my colleagues and myself. In October, 7th 1989 the code Nos, were 370 and 364 and hence 370 or 364 was to appear on MFI-10. I cannot tell which one was to appear there. Ref: MFI-11 either 370 or 364 was to appear on day form on the stamp at the bottoms and the same applies to MFI-14(a)(b)(c),(d)(e)(f), MFI-15(a)(b)(c)(d)(e), the code No could either be 370 or 364. But I am not clear as to which one would have been used on each of them. I did not handle any of these documents above. I did not process them. All  accused were in my shifts and these forms could not have been processed in my absence. I would have seen them using a different stamp my shifts was busy most of the time. They would only pass the documents to us to process. At the counter they only enter figures and Nos and pass them over to us for processing and stamping and they would only pay after confirming the day special date stamp. We were the only people having the stamps. If I initialled a form, they would pay one counter officer verify the  information and stamps then with post office stamp and put their Nos. and pass them to us for processing. Supervisors cannot conspire to defraud without a counter officer revising the passbook. Yes I can bring the diary containing the faulty day stamps on which dates the defects were discovered and withdrawn. There are records which are kept. The book shows the handing over report and when the stamp was working and withdrawn.\n<name/>:- I also need the book.\n<name/>:- I leave it to court.\nCourt:- Case  reffered> to court No. 1 on 22.6.92 for re-allocation for at least a week to cover the 13 witnesses still remaining. Bond Extended.\nP.W. 1 A MALE ADULT SWORN AND RE-CALLED AND STATES:-\nLast time I was stood over to go and collect a register wherein the rubber stamps were used then, but I have not been able to trace it. It is lost, in the circumstances, I do not have it to offer.\nxx. by 1st accused:- NIL.\nxx. by 6th accused:- NIL.\nxx. by <name/> for 2nd and 8th Accused:-\nI only supervised the 8th accused at City Square, main counter, he was working under my shifts for about 5 months. I have been a supervisor at Community HQ. G.P.O. Tom Mboya post office and at City Square post office stock payments stock lists come from Savings bank HQ. after every forty nights indicating the passbooks allegedly stolen or those circulating irregularity e.g. adding in funds irregularity. Every supervisor would have the stock payment list to check on it. The significance of the Nos. on the special date stamps is the differentiation of which post office it would have been used I would be able to tell it one is used in another post office. There were about ten to eight cashiers on the counter they were not changing unless their duties changed. I would not tell the signatures of every cashiers, but I could tell of those I was working with.\nxx. by <name/> for 7th accused and also for H/B. for <name/> for 7th accused:-\nI know its supposed to be kept for a period of 2 years and its called a diary book. But this particular one has disappeared it would have shown which supervisor had which stamps and on which particular days. Yes, I recorded a statement with the Police and I signed every page of it.

I do not know where he lived. <name/> was a bursar at Kenya High School. I knew <name/> in 1980. I do recall in 24.12.89 I met the deceased. The deceased said he wanted to see me but I was in a hurry. I told him to meet me another day. On 26.12.89 I met deceased at Kilungu market Makueni district. It was during the day. The deceased told me he wanted a car to buy and I should assist him. I told him we revisit the issue in Nairobi. On 2.1.90 the deceased rang me and asked me to accompany him to view a car he had seen. On 3.1.90 I met the deceased person. We went to a professor\'s residence. The professor wanted to sell his <foreign/>volks <foreign/>wagen Beetle. We took the vehicle for a drive test. After we tested the vehicle I felt it was old and spare parts would be a problem so we parted 8-9 p.m. The following day, I think I phoned the deceased as I had seen a <foreign/>Volks <foreign/>Wagen advertised in the papers. When I rang Kenya High I was told he had travelled upcountry as there was someone sick. I do not know how many times I called the deceased. On Saturday 6.1.90 I travelled <name/> asked me whether I had learnt <name/> was dead. I told him I was not aware. He then referred me to Kenya Times Newspapers reporting the death. I then made my statement to the Police. I used to meet the deceased sometimes in Kilungu market. The deceased person did not complain to me of anything unusual. When we checked on the motor vehicle the deceased did not tell me where he would get the money to buy it or how. The deceased was not my personal friend but came from my home area. I last saw the deceased alive on 3.1.90. I did not notice the deceased had a watch. I would not identify a watch that deceased used to wear. I learnt the deceased disappeared before he died.\nXXED. By Counsel: I would not know who caused the death of the deceased. We were  acquaintances>. I last saw deceased alive on 3.1.90 he never complained to me about anyone going after his blood.\nP.W. 8 - Adult/Male/Sworn states:\nMy names are <name/>. I work at Wire Products Limited as an Ass. Manager technical. I live at Mbotela. I know the deceased as we are related. We are cousins. He used to be the bursar of Kenya High School in July 1989. I used to stay with the deceased at Kenya High School. When I lived with the deceased we were friendly as we used to go out together. I stayed with him until he disappeared on 4.1.90. The deceased did not take alcohol. I would sometimes go out with the deceased. I used to take a little alcohol. In December 1989 <name/> a lecturer at the University of Nairobi was to leave for U.K. in January. He had to dispose off property among them a <foreign/>volks <foreign/>wagen and a <foreign/>citroen. <name/> told me about this. I and the deceased were entered in the vehicles. I in the <foreign/>citroen and deceased in the <foreign/>Volks <foreign/>wagen. The <foreign/>citroen was going for 20,000/- and <foreign/>Volks <foreign/>wagen for 30,000/-. We had to look for the money. I had Kshs. 16,000/- and had to borrow the rest. The deceased also got the money partly from the savings and partly from co-operatives. On 3.1.90 at 6 a.m. I left the house leaving the deceased there. I left deceased sleeping. On 3.1.90 at 12 noon I received a call from the deceased to look at the cars. We then decided some (P.W. 7) <name/> accompany us to see the cars. We went to house of <name/> and we took a ride in the car for <name/> to see whether it was good as <name/> owned a <foreign/>volks <foreign/>wagen previously. <name/> said it was an old car. We both went home on 3.1.90. On arrival at Kenya High School we cooked and ate. The deceased had Kshs. 33,000/- when we went to view the cars. The deceased then counted the money at Kenya High School. On 4.1.90 I woke up at 6.30 a.m. left deceased sleeping. \nS1BCE01K\nPros: I am left to call six witnesses but only two can testify as I have no documents relating to the other four. I have two witnesses to call now.\n3RD P.W. X/M S/S\nMy name is <name/>. I am *emplyed> KGGCU as the area *Manager> in charge of Eastern Kenya which includes Nairobi and Mombasa. My work is to supervise KGGCU branches in terms of administration. I know accused. He is <name/>. He is that man (accused). He was working as a clerk in KGGCU Godown at KNTC *alongyellow> road in *Industiral> Area. He was a clerk under me.  Accused\'s work was to manage or supervise receipts and dispatches of *Fertilizers> stored at KGGCU stores. On 27.3.91 I received a letter from our head office. This letter was transferring accused from Nairobi *ware house> to KGGCU Nairobi branch. On receiving the letter I was supposed to get *some one> to take over from accused. I requested my *ware-house> assistant <name/> to go and *takeover> from accused. <name/> went to *takeover>. On 6.5.91 I got information from Mr. <name/> that there was fishy work which had been going on at the KNTC go-downs. On 7.5.91 I went to verify what was the matter. Since I had information as to where the operation went wrong, I went straight to the place. I found some labourer changing the fertilizers from 25x5x5x55 to D.A.P. *Fertilizer> bags. I asked the  labourers what they were doing. They told me that they had been instructed to do the change by accused. There was no instruction to change. It is not even allowed. Each type of fertilizer has its own packing bags. I asked accused if he is the one who had issued the instructions and he denied. I then instructed accused and Mr. <name/> to take the figures of the fertilizers which had been changed and to take the figures of empty bags which had been emptied. I then reported the case to our internal auditors in Nakuru which is our head-office. I *reportedas> I suspected there was something wrong. The internal auditor sent a Mr. <name/> to verify. He arrived on 8.5.91 and started checking. I was asked to take over the store keys from accused. Finally it was confirmed by Mr. <name/> that there were missing  bags of D.A.P. fertilizers. From then our security officers took over the matter. We prepared a taking officer certificate which was signed by accused and <name/> so Mr. <name/> took over from accused. The handing over certificate was prepared by accused and Mr. <name/> and I witnessed the taking over certificates. Accused, Mr. <name/> and Mr. <name/> did the actual counting and after verification they made this stock take-check book. This report is in a form of a book. This report is in a form of a book with serial numbers which number is 183141. It is dated 15.5.91 and relates KNTC go-down. The stock take-check book is kept in the office. (marked Mfl 34). According to this document (Mfl 34) 50 kg. DAP fertilizer had a shortage of 1742 bags. This a bin card record kept in the stores. It is the control card in the store. This relates to DAP missing fertilizer and it is for the period 6.3.91 to 16.5.91 (marked Mfl 35). This is the office record for the same DAP fertilizer. We call it Kardex. It is number 80312 and the second Kardex is 80281 of the same fertilizer but it is kept in the office. There are two movements of fertilizers. There movement-in and movement-out that is dispatch and receipt. When the clerk in the go-down receives the fertilizer he  enters it in into *Freight> book and then he transfers the same quantity into the bin card. After this he  writes out another record called KGGCU 58 transferring the same quantity or information from the freight book into the KGGCU 58. The original of *Freight> book and the original KGGCU 58 is brought to *out> offices on Kampala road and from these details we enter the details into our cardex record.\nAfter we had up-dated our cardex we forward the original of KGGCU 58 and original of the *Freight> book to our *Head> office and we retain duplicates. The second transaction is dispatch which is movement out. Here the clerk must get authority from the *ware house> manager to dispatch anything from the warehouse. The authority goes to the clerk in form of inter branch transfer (IBT). We call it KGGCU 50. The clerk receives the IBTs signed by the manager. When the clerk receives IBTs he releases the quantity he is authorised to dispatch. He *cant> release anything unless he has authority in IBTs form. Orders are normally released to our branches not individuals. After dispatch the IBTS is taken back to our offices in Kampala road and we update our cardex cards from the information from the cardex. I am aware of 1742 bags shortage. At the material time I was the *ware house> manager in Nairobi currently I am the Eastern area manager. I took over as manager warehouse Nairobi in February 1991 and in February 1992 I was promoted to *Area Manager>. There was another loss which was discovered by the auditors after intensive investigation.\nXxd by Mrs. <name/>: I knew accused from 1986. Accused since employment had been working in that *ware house>. KNTC was one of the godowns. There are many  go-downs or  warehouses and KNTC was one of the many  go-downs. We had leased a go-down at KNTC premises. We had only a small office for accused and the rest were stores. Accused had one labourer who was assisting him. We had eight stores in the KNTC warehouse. We had security hired from another firm who were guarding the place. There is a gate which is manned by KNTC security. At night we had our security guarding the place. Where we have our own compound we keep records of vehicles which come in but this was KNTC compound and many vehicles would come to KNTC so KNTC could have kept the vehicle record. KNTC personnel was not under me. It was  accused\'s duty to know what was coming in or going out. The KNTC had no reason to ask what our clients were carrying out. Accused would have moved out as soon as the handing over was complete. I made *some one> available to take over from accused. I *cant> remember when Mr. <name/> went to take over from accused but it was in April, 1991. My duty was to see that a proper handing over had been done. I am not aware that Mr. <name/> reported on duty in  accused\'s place on 3.4.91. I am not aware that accused and Mr. <name/> took stock on 3.4.91. The *store-check> books are in a form of a book. Page 183138 was missing from the stock check book and I have never seen it. I look at the records as *incharge>. Accused and <name/> signed Mfl 34. I did not count the stock. Accused and Mr. <name/> agreed Mfl 34 was correct. I was there during the taking over. The *stockcheck> records are kept by the clerk when not used. If they are used they are brought to my office stock check page 183138 was missing and I have never seen it. From page 1831348 to 41 were three pages. The bin card and *cadex> are records of stock. The freight book would reflect what was delivered. Mr. <name/> took over from accused on 15.5.91. On 27.4.91 I was away on leave and there was an assistant manager. Mr. <name/> is outside court. I had not sent Mr. <name/> to take over. Mr. <name/> was to take over the whole store and Mr. <name/> was sent there to see that accused did not interefere with the checked records as Mr. <name/> was away on urgent matter. Mr. <name/> was not coming to take over from Mr.<name/>. I am not aware of an earlier taking over. I gave verbal instruction to accused and Mr. <name/>. We wrote a letter asking for handover when we discovered malpractises. Mr. <name/> came from head office to witness the handover. Accused and Mr. <name/> signed a taking over certificate also. Mr. <name/> signed the handover certificate. He never refused to sign the certificate. Mr. <name/> told me that there was unusual operation in the *depo>. I went there and I found the usual changing the bags and they told me accused had ordered them to do so. I saw them changing the bags. The clerk employs casual labourers and he pays them from money from the office. I ordered the labourers to stop *th> *changin> the fertilizer. We did not charge the  labourers because they were working under the instructions of accused. May be the  labourers did not know it was wrong. If there are damages the bags are kept aside for insurance people to come and verify them for payment.\nP.W. 3 *REcalled> S/S\nXxd by Mr. <name/>: Damaged goods are kept aside for the insurance claims. Whatever is damaged is reported on KGGCU 58 and even the good bags are reported. You put the damaged goods on delivery note. You fill the claim forms claiming compensation for damaged goods. I agree some claims were raised during  accused\'s period. We have internal claim forms and we have a claim for the *Railways>. Accused indicates the damaged goods and the manager signs. The number of damaged bags must be indicated in the freight book and also should agree with claim forms, delivery note and claim forms plus KGGCU 58. The manager signs  the claim forms. When insurance received our claim forms we bargain. The insurance  comes and counts the damaged bags. There is an office which deals with claims. We keep claim forms. Police collected our KGGCU 56, claim forms and freight book. On 12.5.91 which was *sunday> I was in the store with Mr. <name/> and Mr. <name/> but accused refused to come. We did not do anything as accused refused to turn up for handing over that Sunday. I withdrew the keys from accused on 8.5.91.\nMr. <name/>: I have few questions on the entries in the documents, and the documents are not in court now.\nPros: The documents have not been brought so we *cant> proceed any further. I have eight more witnesses to call.\nCourt: B/E for accused to appear in court one on 1.7.92 for fresh hearing date.\nN.B: Long case two days.\n4th P.W. X/M S/S\nMy name is <name/>. I am employed by KGGCU attached to *Industrial Area> Nairobi *Area> as *Warehouse> assistant. My duty is to manage other workers. I get instructions from *Manager> and implement the instructions then report back. The 1st week of April, 1991 I was instructed by p.w. 3 to go and take over our stores which were at KNTC along Yala road; as the officer there was going on transfer. I was going to take over the store from Mr. <name/> who is that man (accused). Accused had been *transfered> to our Nairobi branch. At KNTC store I met Mr. <name/> who was assistant manager and Mr. <name/> who is *incharge> of *Fertilizers>. I went to  accused\'s office. I told accused I was the one who was to take over from him. Accused then took me round the stores. I took over from accused on 15.5.91. We signed the handing over, *taking-over> certificates after checking the stores. We completed this store checkbook or checking sheet (Mfl 34). This checking sheet after checking went to our auditors. On this checking sheet I found in store 69223 bags 20x10x10 each of 50 kg fertilizers. I then signed the bin card which was showing 69223 bags of fertilizers. The cardex card which is kept under lock and maintained by a different person was showing the same figure. On the same store I found Muriate potash 50 kg fertilizers. I found 37185 bags each of 50 kg. each. The bin card and the cardex  card were each reading the same. I checked several other fertilizers now including DAP fertilizers 50 kg. bags physical store I found 1637 bags but the bin card was reading 3379 bags. \nS1BCE02K\nHEARING STARTS\nP.W. I <name/> S/S IN ENGLISH\nI work with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting as *Deputy> secretary. I recall that in the first week of January, 1993 one Mr. <name/> of HFCK rang my office. He wanted to know whether I had HFCK *Which> I opened in 1988.\nI replied in the affirmative. The account was still operational. Mr. <name/> asked if I knew any official at HFCK. I told him I knew Mr. <name/> who was dealing with my *mortage> account which was closed in 1989 when I cleared the *mortage>. Mr. <name/> indicated there was a problem. I immediately proceeded to HFCK I alerted Mr. <name/> that I lost my identity card in the last week of December, 1992 and that I reported to police and got an abstract vide receipt No AU 683412 for 10.1.93 (Receipt marked with abstract Mfl 1). I got a new identity card No. 12372133. The number on the lost identity card was 1728399/64. All the documents bear my old identity card number. The abstract shows it was for loss of identity card. Mr. <name/> told me there was a problem with someone else\'s account not mine. He did not tell me the particulars. Mr. <name/> said I would hear from CID *Headquarters>. Later at the CID *Headquarters>, around February I was shown a chit purportedly in my name authorising withdrawal of money from an account from HFCK. I see the chit in question here in court. It is not dated. It is addressed to the banking manager HFCK. It purports to be in my name and *siganture>. The signature is not mine. The identity card No. quoted there on is No. 1728399/64 which is the number of my old identity card. The writing on this chit is not mine, neither the signature (chit marked Mfl 2). I now see a cash withdrawal slip dated 5.1.93 purporting to be in my name and signatures. It is not in my writing. The address quoted there on is 30050 which is not mine. I use my personal post box No. 61581 NAIROBI. The official one I hardly use for my personal transaction. I *dont> even know it off head. The withdrawal slip for *shs.> 75,000/- (withdrawal slip marked MFl 3). I did not authorise anyone to withdraw money at HFCK. My account number is 1/44431 at HFCK which is different from a/c. No 1/10/200 on the withdrawal slip. My account was intact. There was no interference. I wish to produce the abstract and receipt as exhibits herein (marked Exb. 1). The name <name/> on the withdrawal slip is not known to me. I do not know the accused. I have never seen him. Neither do I know the owner account No 1/01/200. I have only one account No. 1/44431 with H.F.C.K now.\n<name/>\nXxd by *Accused>: nil.\n<name/>\nP.W. 2 <name/> S/S IN ENGLISH\nI work with HFCK as assistant banking manager. I am *incharge> of opening new accounts authorising withdrawals, supervision etc. I do recall on 6.1.93 one of my officers reported to me that a customer had called in for a transaction. She wanted a cheque processed. It was for *shs.> 200,000/- The customer left and returned the next day. She came to the same officer <name/> and said that her account showed a debit of *shs.> 60,000/- which she was not aware of. I got this information from Ali Bwana on 7.1.93. The customer was in our office. I talked to her. She maintained she had not withdrawn *shs.> 60,000/- from her account. She held a joint account with her husband. The customer was <name/>, her husband <name/>. The couple had an account No. 1/2016. I told the customer to leave me with copies of the passbook to investigate the matter. I started investigations. Our officer <name/> remembered a transaction for *shs.> 75,000/- done on 5.1.93 which had been debited from account 1/1200. The original owner of this account is one <name/>. When I checked I discovered the name <name/> had been altered in the computer system to read <name/>. I called for the withdrawal slip for the 5.1.93 transaction, so too the register. Whenever there is a change in any account it must be recorded in our register for change such changes must be supported by evidence e.g. gazettement marriage certificate. The change in this case was reflected in the computer printout of 5.1.93. I see the printout in question for 5.1.93. It is a copy which I have certified. The printout shows that the account was now reverting to the name <name/> from <name/>. I could not get the initial printout which changed the account name from (Mfl 4A) <name/> to <name/> though I looked. This particular change was done after the *shs.> 75,000/- had been withdrawn from the account. I also recovered another document - daily transaction (Mfl 4B) check list for 5.1.93. This shows that account No. 1/1200 *wad> debited with *shs.> 75,000/- and that it was then in the name of <name/>, which name appeared on the withdrawal form used to withdraw (Mfl 3 id) (change form printout Mfl 4A, Transaction list Mfl 4B) I also saw a letter authorising withdrawal form the said account (Mfl 2 id). The payment is *shs.> 75,000/- was paid by Miss <name/>. The payee was <name/> being the title of the account at the time but the actual *receipient> was <name/>, as per the withdrawal slip and authorising chit (Mfl2). He signed on the withdrawal form at the rear.\nAfter getting this information I contacted <name/> who denied having operated the account No. 1/1200. He however told me he had lost his identity card sometimes in December 1992. <name/> was our employee working in the computer room. We questioned him. We asked him to bring to us <name/>, but he was unable to. The matter was then reported to the police. <name/> is the accused *Identified>.\nIn the case of a change of names once documents for change are lodged with us; the information is authorised by an officer in the register. The name will be changed and the change will be entered in the computer and will be reflected in a document like Mfl 1 4A at the end of the day.\n<name/>\nCourt: Witness stood down to bring register at 2.00 p.m.\n<name/>\nP.W. 3 MRS. <name/> S/S IN ENGLISH\nI work with HFCK *AS A BANk> cashier. I do recall on 25.1.93 at 4.00 p.m. I was about to close when a *memeber> of staff came with a withdrawal slip for a customer who was said to have come late. The staff member is <name/> (Accused identified). This is the withdrawal slip he had (Mfl 3 id). He also had a savings book for the same customer and identity. I asked for authority to collect for the customer. Accused produced a letter authorising him to collect (Mfl 2 id.) I needed to consult my seniors regarding the payment. I was authorised by <name/> and <name/> to pay. <name/> is the first officer. He sent me to the 2nd officer <name/>. He allowed me to pay a payment of over *shs.> 5,000/- must be authorised in writing. Both signed on the withdrawal slip Mfl2 (shown) to authorise the payment to our member of staff. When the accused gave me the letter authorising him to collect on a customer\'s behalf I went back and asked <name/> and <name/> whether to pay. They  said since it was a member of staff I should pay. I went back and the accused wrote his name and signed at the rear of the withdrawal form (Mfl 2-shown) I paid the accused *shs.> 75,000/-. He was working in the computer room as an operator.\nWe have four people working in the computer room.\n<name/>\nXxd by *Accused>: When you brought Mfl 3 the signatures of <name/> and <name/> were already there. I however sought authority for them to allow me pay you on behalf of the customer. You gave me the letter authorising you to collect on behalf of the customer  who you said was outside. I did not see him.\n<name/>\nP.W. 4 <name/> S/S IN ENGLISH\nI work with HFCK as banking officer in charge of operations. I oversee the identification of customers, computer operations, authorising payments over *shs.> 1,000/-.\nI do recall on 7.1.93 at about 3.30 p.m. a member of the staff in computer room *bought> me a passbook register, withdrawal slip, identity card and specimen signature card of the account holder. *He> accused said the customer was his friend and he wanted me to authorise payment as it was past 3.00 p.m. and we had closed. I compared the signatures and identification documents. I sent him to the *Assistant> banking manager (O.P) Mr. <name/>.\nLater P.w. 2 came and said she would not pay the *shs.> 75,000/- as the customer was not there. She said <name/> had shown her a better authorising withdrawal on behalf of the customer. I said she should not pay if she could not see the customer. Accused insisted he was authorised. I sent them to go to Mr. <name/> my boss and if he was allowed he could be paid. My boss *overrulled> me and <name/> was paid. A few days later a customer came and said her account had been debited for *shs.> 75,000/- at a time she was out of the country. I sent for the voucher authorising the payment and noticed it was not Mr. <name/>\'s signature. To me it looked forged  what\'s more <name/> was out of the city then. I had seen a copy. I went to see the original voucher itself. I saw it had a cashier\'s rubber stamp whose number had been rubbed out. One could therefore not tell who paid. A cashier\'s rubber stamp number is assigned to only one person working at a certain counter. She/He is responsible for it and must keep it safe. The voucher in question had only one authority which was also questionable. I alerted Mr. <name/>. I went to the register and found the *Banking> manager and Miss <name/>. But the  names on the voucher differed with those on the register itself. I decided to look at the reports for name changes for this particular account. I found that the names of the account holder had been changed from <name/> and <name/> to <name/> on 1.12.92 and later turned back to the names of the  complainants who were the genuine account  holders. I alerted my boss.\nLater on a withdrawal slip was brought to me in the name of <name/>. When I saw the slip I thought I had seen this name somewhere. I realized this was the same name which had been on documents brought to me earlier. I took a photocopy of the ID. *Card> signature card and authorised payment to the customer. I decided to see if the same method had been used in paying *shs.> 75,000/- as in that of *shs.> 60,000/- I discovered that <name/> was our customer holding a  totally different account. His name however was used to transfer the name of account No. 1/1200 of <name/> into his name and later revert it to the genuine account holder (see Mfl 4A).\nXxd by Accused: We have a place where we keep documents lost in the bank and one working in the bank would know that and even have access. I did recall that the accused had brought to me the payment voucher for *shs.> 75,000/- (Mfl 3). I authorised payment and gave my signature. He had brought an identity card passbook and specimen *signture>. I retired and upon being satisfied I signed giving my authority. Here is my authority on Mfl 3. This was on 5.1.93. At the bottom of my signature I endorsed (known to <name/>). I did not see the customer but the accused said this was his friend. I thought he had already been identified at the cashier\'s desk. Later on 5.1.93 the cashier came refusing to pay and I told her not to since a different person was reviewing. \nS1BCE03K\nAccused present\nP.W.2 *Duly> sworn in English states\nMy name is <name/>. I am *Mananging Director> of Private *proximate> Insurance *brokers> Limited. I know the accused *Person> he had approached in early 1989 for *Employment>. He had worked elsewhere in the *Industry> and I requested him to join us on temporary basis pending his performance.\nHe finally joined us in March 1989 and I assigned him accounts executive. These are the people who attend to clients who come for *Insurance> services.\nHis main duties were to attend to clients and issue with *Insurance> company to obtain certificates for them.\nHis performance was good because he is capable but there were things which hindered his permanent employment because we got complaints of previous which he never paid to the *Company>.\nIn may 1990 I was planning to go to an overseas trip. Two weeks earlier there were </conplaints> regarding these clients were my close friends.\nWhen they came to complain I asked the accused to stop working until I came back from my trip. I suspended the accused.\nI came back in June 1990 at around 20th. From London I rang the office and learnt there was a serious problem where a customer had been issued a temporary certificate.\nIn April 1990 some cover notes had been issued which I had no knowledge of. The client wanted permanent certificate because he had paid the required premiums. I was told the client was told the client was making a lot of noise.\nWhen I came back I realized Mr. <name/> was involved. There was no evidence in my office that the client had paid.\nThe *clietn> is <name/> who had insured hit two vehicles. I talked to <name/> when I came back and I asked him who he had paid. He told me it was the accused. He produced a note given to him purporting to be receipts (shown MFI I). The amount was *shs.> 11,000/= and the 2nd is *shs.> 21,000/=.\nThese were in respect of *Motor> vehicles KZH 002 and KAA 788D. The  complainant\'s slips did not state what the payments were for.\nI recognise these as Mr. <name/>\'s hand writing and the signature is his.\nThe normal procedure is that money is paid to cashier or accountant who issues receipts and we have never run short of the receipts.\nI checked and I found no records of Mr. <name/>. I checked from cash sales register.\nThis is a sales ledger (*Marked> MFI 2). I checked in the month of April and there was no entry of Mr. <name/>.\nMr. <name/> had started coming to our office in April 1990. I wondered why Mr. <name/> paid the money without receipts. I *adviced> him to go and take any action deemed fit. Including reporting to CID for further investigations.

The total amount to be paid for insuring both motor vehicles was *shs.> 43,000/=. He had done shopping and these were best rates.\nAfter discussing I filled proposal form. The complainant went through the forms and he signed.\nAfter that I gave him 14 days cover note. *Themoney> was acknowledged by completing slip.\nThis was because as was well known to him PSV *Premiums> are *payale> directly to *Insurance> company and a broker would only get commission.\nIn providing compl. slip I would give client confidence that the money was in proper hands since the money was not receivable to us.\nMr. <name/> was to come with before *expirey> of the 14 days.

I would say she had no need for the money, she just wanted us to reconcile. Her father told me about the money through elders whom I had sent to get back my dowry. The father told them to tell me to repay  complainant\'s money first. I had sent the elders often between November, 1991 and July, 1991. The goats paid as dowry is not valued in monetary terms traditionally. The value of goats was more than 1,500/-. Yes, I was claiming more from them than they were from me. Since parting in September, 1991 to *july>, 1992 we had no serious disagreements between us. I came to know <name/> here in court. When I visited  complainant\'s house I never even saw <name/> there. I *dont> know her at all. I would say she had been told to come here and say what she did. I did not know names of  complainant\'s neighbours but I knew them facially. I would say that the complainant made this complaint because she learnt that I was planning to marry another woman. Her house,  complainant\'s, had a bed, cupboard and stools. \nS1BCE06K\nTrial within a trial:\nPW5 - Adult male sworn states\nMy name is Inspector <name/> from C.I.D. divisional.

They then took me to Parklands police station where I was taken to the *cells.> and detained till IP.M. When IP <name/> came and asked me if I had gone to an Asian\'s place on 27th a Monday I explained to her that I did not go there as I was working on that day. I was then taken to an ID *Parade> where my ex-cellmates identified me. The police m/v is normally signed for *whereever> it leaves the premises for an errand. I was only going to hospital at Forces Memorial *hospital> to see my boss - Mr. <name/>. I frequently visited him in hospital. But none of my identifing witnesses testified as to what I had allegedly done. Even the complainant herself denied having seen nor known me. I do not know the 2nd and 3rd  accused.

They took me to the police station where I recorded statements. I was forced to sign statements. 2 men were brougth from the cells and it was alleged that I had been planning with them and I denied.\nFinally I was brought to court and charged.\nNo witnesses to call.\nMr. <name/>:\nThe 3  accused are charged with the offence of robbery. The evidence on record so far points to the innocence of  accused. PW I and PW 2 stated that they did not see first accused and yet the robbery took place at 10.00 a.m. during the day. PW 3 said he had seen a police *m.v> along the road and later heard that there was theft. But he never saw anybody himself; nor anybody *alighing> from the police m/v go to the house.\nP.W. 4 in cross examination said he did not know those who told him there was a theft.

PW 8 who conducted an ID parade said that first accused was identified by 2 people who were never summoned to testify and they both feature *nowehere> in the proceedings. The evidence on record cannot assist the court in convicting first accused. \nS1BCE08K\nP.W.1 - A male adult, sworn and states:-\nI am No. 102580 Cpl. <name/> attached to 82 Airforce at Moi Airbase.

A fair plan was also made and I now wish to produce both in court as exhibits. (produced).\nxx. by Mr. <name/>: It was not possible to determine the point of impact. At 3.20 p.m. during the day, two days after the accident, I drew the road view. I did not inquire if the street lights were working at night.\nProsecutor: The Doctor has not come.\nAccused present\nMr. <name/> present\nProsecutor: I am still expecting the *Doctor>.\nCourt: Hearing when the *Doctor> comes today.\n<name/>\nP.W.6 - A male adult sworn and states:\nDr. <name/>, a police pathologist attached to city mortuary in Nairobi. On 30.7.87 at the city mortuary I performed a post mortem on the body of No. 10093 Cpl. <name/>. It was identified to me by Cpl. <name/> and <name/>. The body was that of a 26 year old male *african>.\nExternally, right thigh bone was broken. A 2 cm. cut above right eye. Right side of head was bruised. Right side of skull was broken. Internally, there was bleeding over the right side of the brain. I formed the opinion that the cause of death was due to bleeding over *gith> side of the brain due to a broken skull consistent with a road traffic accident. A blood sample was submitted to government chemist. I then completed and signed a post mortem form which I now wish to produce as an exhibit (2). This is the report from *Government> analyst (3).\nxx. by Mr. <name/>:- This is the report I received from the *Government> analyst. He had taken a minimum of 9 whiskies. It depends on capacity and tolerance on individual. This is likely to make one *typsy>. A drunk person can be a little unconscious. When drinking on an empty stomach, he might have been quite drunk.\nProsecutor: This is the close of the case. \nS1BCE09K\nP.W.I NO.48871 P.C. <name/> SWORN STATES:-\nI am attached to Pangani Police station. On 3/10/91 I reported on duty at 6.00 p.m. and was to work till morning.\nWe then went with other officers on duty at Eastleigh. We started with section 2. And near Mateso Bila Chuki Bar, we came, 2 people singing crossing the road. When we saw them the driver stopped the lorry and we arrested them for being drunk and disorderly.\nWhile on the lorry they were singing and shouting that "Nyayo juu", serikali juu" and that we were arresting them because of the Ford meeting. At the police station, we charged them with the offences. While in cells they continued to bang on the doors. We left them in cells to await the O.C.S. I had not known the 2 accused persons before. They are the 2 in court.\nxxd. by <name/>:-\nWhen I first saw the  accused they were singing "Nyayo juu, KANU Government juu.". They were crossing the road from one side to the other. Both of them were staggering, we felt that accused No.1 with his staggering, he could be hit by a motor vehicle.\nAI did not tell us that he had a problem with his legs, after being injured during the struggle for *intependence>.\nI believe the other people on the lorry also saw them. When we booked them we did so for being drunk. I do not know if I was brought to court on 14/10/91. I have been in the force for 6 years. For an offence like this one, the suspects should have been brought to court on the following day or after 2 or 3 days.\nI am not aware of any <*/haklas compus> order made by the High *court> which made him to be brought to court charged with this offence.\nI can see this order of the High Court in an application No. 451/91. It is in respect of AI and was issued on 11/10/91.\nI do not know if he was charged to defeat the order of the High *court>. Both  accused told us that we were arresting them so that they could not go to the meeting on 5/10/91 at Kamukunji.\nI have said that they said this at the time of arrest. We arrested them for being drunk. AI did not tell us that he is a KANU life member. He showed us no card to that effect. None of us tore the card. It is us police officers and the people we had arrested who heard what he was saying.\nWith me I could not be disturbed by what they said. The people we had arrested and were in the lorry were about 15.\nA cell can hold a maximum of about 40 people. We put both  accused in a cell with other people. A cell has a door and a small window through which you can see (through).\nThe accused are the ones who were banging the door, we left them still beating on the door.\nxxd. by A2:- I was not the cell sentry and I do not know if any of the people who came to see you were chased away.\nxxr:- None.\n<name/>\nP.W.2 NO. 51210 P.C. <name/> ALI SWORN STATES:-\nI am attached to Pangani Police station.\nOn 3/10/91 while with other police officers we went to patrol at Eastleigh. While on 2nd Avenue near Mateso Bila Chuki we saw 2 people staggering along the road. We then stopped and arrested them.\nOn the lorry AI started shouting "Moi Juu Serikali ya Kanu juu". He said this so that he could be set free. A2 was also shouting the same thing.\nAt the station AI told A2 that these people are *priting> us in cells so that they could not attend the Kamukunji meeting.\nThey then kept on shouting and banging on the cell door. I can see AI. The other *on> I cannot recall him well.\nxxd. by <name/>:-\nAI was staggering on the road. It was not in the usual way walking. I did not know his usual way of walking.\nI did not see which direction he was going. I heard AI say that they were being arrested to prevent them from attending the meeting at Kamukunji. I did not take this seriously. I did not bother to know his manner of his walking.\nAI did not show me a KANU life membership card. I do not know if he showed it to any other officer. I did not see any KANU *badage>.\nI booked them for being drunk and disorderly. I do not know when they were taken to court.\nI can see this High Court order. I do not know if they were taken to court to defeat the habeas corpus order. I was not there when they were taken to court.\nXXR:- None\n<name/>\nC/P:- That is the close of our case.\n<name/>:- I submit no case is made out to put the accused on their defence.\nThe evidence is clear that they were walking on the road shouting "Nyayo Juu, KANU Government Juu". These words even shouted on a road or a *Police> station cannot be any offensive words.\nThis is the slogan of the day even in meetings attended by the president.\nWith regard to the staggering, AI has a walking problem. A2 did admit this. Thirdly, there is evidence that P.W.2 never took it seriously when AI said that they were being arrested to prevent them from attending the meeting. This is not inciting.\nThere is no evidence to confirm who shouted and banged the cell door when there were other prisoners there. Accused should be acquitted and the case dismissed under section 210 C.P.C.\nC/P:- There is ample evidence adduced. Accused have a case to answer.\nP.W.I stated that the reason for the arrest is that they were walking on the road dangerously in view of the traffic on the road. It is not because of shouting. They were drunk to the point of being incapable of controlling themselves.\nAs stated by P.W.2 they continued to shout and also banged the cell door. Their other behaviour, they were also charged because of the shouting and banging the door. Nobody took what they said to be an offence but their conduct. \nS1BCE10K\nP.W. 1 <name/> M/a/s/states.\nI am assistant personnel manager at International Casino. I am in charge of security. I have been in charge of security for 16 years. On 27.2.93 at about 1.00 a.m. the accused was brought to the office. He is a dealer, a trainee dealer. They chip the ball at the gaming room at the casino. He was therefore and employee of the casino. He was brought by one of the bouncers <name/>. I was told he had stolen 12 chips worth Kshs 6,000/- each is worth 500/-) It is the security man who had the chips. The security man told me the accused is to leave the chips at the table and not remove them. As the accused was going for tea, he was suspected to have stolen the chips as one inspector <name/> said he had seen the accused stealing the chips from the table, and that as he was going for tea he was approached and he dropped the chips down and was arrested and brought to security office together with the exhibits. I asked the accused whether he had stolen and he admitted and I told him to write that down and he did. I then rang Parklands police station and he was arrested and I handed them over to police as exhibits. These are the chips (12) MFI 1). They each value at 500/-. I have worked with the accused for all over 6 years. In the course of that period we have never disagreed.\nYYD by the accused.\nThe bouncer who brought you was holding the chips and you were with him. You also came with Inspector<name/>. I have a copy of the statement you wrote. I can show the court. It is here (court shown). I was not aware you were removed from one table to another. I was not there when you were arrested.\nRe-examination: Nil.\nP.W. 2 <name/> M/a/s/states.\nI am an employee of International Casino. I do security work. On the night of 26/2/93 I was on duty. At 12.50 a.m. while on duty I was patrolling around the gaming room, I was called by <name/> and inspector who supervises the dealers.\n10.10 a.m. Defence counsel walks into court.\nCourt: The court reads out the evidence on record to the counsel.\n<name/> called me at a loud sound and he told me "<name/> arrest that person". That person was the accused, he was not in the room. He had left the room and moved 15 paces away. The accused had handed over duty to some one else. I hurriedly towards the accused and on seeing me he tried to hurry off and I quickened my steps and as I was going to hold him he threw the chips down and tried to ran off but I held him and I collected the chips and took the accused to the security office. I know the accused is not allowed to leave with the chips. He is supposed to leave them with the supervisor at the table. I have worked with the accused for over 5 years but we have not disagreed. This are the chips (MFI 1).\nCC by defence counsel.\nThe accused was on a table called Black Jack. I do not know how many tables a dealer attends to. There is only one dealer on each table. When a dealer goes for break, there is someone who comes to replace him. There is a lady who replaced the accused. I do not know her. I know the accused was not going to another table. He was going for break. He was from the tables. I am sure he was going for break. He was heading towards the staff door for break. I did collect the chips from where the accused threw them. I collected the chips from the floor. The only other person who saw me arrest the accused was one Dickson. I did not see anything else. It is not true the accused was changing from one table to another. I am convinced the accused was going for break. The accused was walking on but on seeing me, walked faster.\nRe-examination: Nil.\nP.W. 3 <name/> m/a/s/states.\nI work for International Casino as a Gaming Inspector. My main duties are to supervise games. In doing that work we do dealers for Black Jack. On the 26/2/93 in the night I was on duty and at 12.50 a.m. I was inspecting tables. Three and four one dealer <name/> was on table 4. Rotationally a dealer moves from table 4 to three and takes an allowed break as he arranges with the management. There was action of table No. 4. Table No. 3 was empty. At that time <name/> was to move from Table 4 to three. I was seated in between the table, facing the tables. I suddenly heard a "hack" sign and I got attracted and I looked around and realised the chips on the tray had been scooped off. I saw the accused move to table three and I asked him what had happened and he told me in Kiswahili <quote/>\nI told him I cannot entertain that rubbish and I went for the accused who started struggling with me and I called <name/> a bouncer and as <name/> came back, the accused realised, all was not well and he tried to throw the chips back but <name/> had gotten hold of him. I stopped the game on table 4 together with <name/> we picked the chips he had dripped. The accused had dropped 12 chips. They are valued at Kshs 500/- each, totalling Kshs 6000/_. If I had not struggled fast, the accused would have thrown them out. He threw them and they landed on the table. They landed on table No. 4. We took the accused and the chips to the manager\'s office. These are the chips which the accused had stolen (MFI1).\nThe tables are just next to each other. When a dealer changes tables, and has been given a break, he has to clap and open his hands to show that he has not taken any chips and I would confirm. It is a procedure the accused knows and its in writing. When a dealer leaves one table to another he is not allowed to move with the chips.\nXXD by the defence counsel.\nWe give gaming supervisor according to the operational tables we have gaming officers from the Govt. They only come to check on tax. There was no Govt. gaming supervisor there. There was a dealer <name/> on Table No. 3. It was <name/> who was going for break. It was the accused to replace <name/> on table 3. <name/> was to replace the accused on table 4. The accused was taking a break to table 3 as there was no action on table 3. The procedure of clapping hands was introduced three years ago. It is in writing. I do not have a copy of the same. The chips fell on the table. Table No. 4 none of the chips fell on the floor. I have worked with the accused for long. I am not aware of him having been involved in such a case before. The accused was serving only 4 customers. The customers got chips from the dealer who sells to them. He of course is in custody of those chips.\nRe-examination.\nThere was a struggle when we were arresting the accused. The struggle was towards table 3 which is towards the door.\nC/P. I wish to apply for an adjournment for re-arresting officer <name/>. He is on leave. I do not know when he returns. I apply for an adjournment.\nCounsel: I have no objection.\nCourt: Reallocation in court No. 1 on 7/2/94.\n\nC/P. I am not ready. This is a  partheard> case, the remaining witness <name/> is on leave, he went before being bonded. He resumes on 15/10/94. I request for an adjournment.\nCounsel. I object to the application. The same reason was used on 14/4/94. The investigating officer was absent. The court gave the prosecution the last adjournment. The defence is anxious to finalise this case. It has been  ponding> since 1993. The accused is unable to get a job anywhere. I request the court to reject the application.\nCourt: Ruling on the 11.10.94\nRuling. The prosecution has been given several adjournment in this matter to avail their witnesses in court but have failed to do so. The witness in question is a police officer who should be easily availed in court. The reasons given by the prosecution are not satisfactory. I therefore give the prosecution a last chance and a further two weeks, a period within which to avail the remaining witness in court or close their case. The case will be heard on the 10./10/94.\nCourt: The court ruling in this matter is clear the prosecution have been given several chances to avail their witnesses in court but in vain. The case cannot be adjourned indefinitely. I reject further adjournment to the prosecution.\nC/P. I have not received the police file. It was with another officer this morning and he has disappeared. I request for the case to be put aside.\nCounsel. The file should have been in court. The Pros. have been dragging with the matter in this case.\nCourt: The court\'s ruling over the prosecution adjournments is clear. The court has ruled against any further adjournment.\nC/P. This is a  partheard> case it had a total of 5 witnesses. Three of them testified. I pray the case be withdrawn under section 87(a) C.P.O.\nCounsel: When the case came up all the witnesses were in court. We are only waiting for one witness. Time again the matter has been adjourned by the prosecution. The defence is convinced the prosecution has no evidence to offer. It would be prejudicial to the accused if the matter is withdrawn. We request for a complete acquittal.\nCourt: Ruling on the 7/11/94.\nCourt: The case has gone to such an advanced stage and indeed the witness the prosecution has failed to call is a police officer who should be easily available in court. The case has been dragging on since Feb. to Nov. and the prosecution have failed to call him. I therefore reject the prosecution application as they are trying to go around the court orders.\nCourt: The application is rejected.\nC/P. That is the close of the prosecution case. \nS1BCE11K\nP.

I do not have the book copy. In the receipt are 3 copies. Original duplicate and *tripulicate>. The duplicate is there in the district office. There should be records of which department was issued with the person from where this receipt have been recovered. I did not go to check who was issued with the book. This was supported by a *reguisition> order signed by the District *vertary> officer. The inspector of police did not have MFI 3 but he had the number for the duplicate. I saw MFI 3 when I was recording my statement. In the original receipt it was issued and particulars of purchase stated. I do not know who bought the drugs or where they were bought.\nRe-examination\nYes the police officer showed me this number of MFI 4. I do not have the duplicate and not the original of MFI4.\nP.

In my office at the particular period we were using this receipt number. There were 3 books in the office then. The book with the number of this receipt the book was one Mukuti. I cannot remember the book number that particular time. This receipt is MFI 3 and MFI 4 the same number but are quite different. I did not receive the Kshs. 50,000/=. If I had received it I could have issued a receipt of the same. I have never seen a time we got receipts with same numbers.\nP. W. on Oath cross-examined by counsel:\nI have been an accounts clerk since 1966. This is about 27 years ago. Over the period I have never seen such a book with similar numbers yet differing particular. I said this book was used by somebody else. I did not write this receipt.

We cannot tell whether it is for 26.10.90 or 26.9.91 (shows to the court). MFI 3 ought to be the original of MFI 4. I recollect issuing Mulinge with an original receipt. That original ought to be with Mulinge. In the office the triplicate could be in the office. The police were not asked for the *tripulate> at all. I took the duplicate copy I took to the DC\'s office. Now I cannot confirm MFI 4 without looking at the one I wrote. We are 4 accounts clerks ie <name/> Myself <name/> and <name/>.

It had asked for money to buy some items, for the department. They had applied for an *imprest>. The receipts have to be handed over to us by the head of the department. I know about some purchase of vaccines in this case. They brought the receipts to surrender the *imprest>. They were passed but later on I heard it was carried and it was indicated they were not in order. After the audit was told to write a statement. I had advised them *imprest> department on the documents submitted. I signed the *imprest> document. I do not remember the amount. Police latter approached me I wrote a statement. I was shown some receipts. These are the receipts MFI 3 and MFI 5. I was not shown this book (MFI 6). AM 778788 is of 22.8.91 and is an official receipt for Kshs. 50,000/=. I remember having cleared the said *imprest> to <name/>. This copy bares the same number dated 26.10.91. It is for Kshs. 10/=. I do not remember seeing MFI 4. Before clearing MFI 3 I checked whether the head of the department had indicated the purchase had been done and if other officers had checked on it and then I checked the *imprest>. Later I learnt the vaccines were not purchased as per the Auditors report.\nP. W. 11 cross-examined by counsel:\nThe *imprest> was *deceared> to me. I received these documents I filled the surrender voucher. I do not know where the voucher is. I have given it to the police. So I am not sure the same was surrendered. There was an *imprest> have one voucher, MFI 5 referred to. It does not bare doctor <name/>\'s name. There is a signature at the back. I relied on the voucher which is not in court today. From these documents in court tell *imprest> was given to the accused or who surrendered the same. Police told me <name/> surrendered the *imprest>. They told me the vaccines had not been bought. I cannot know what the vaccine was for. As I stand here I do not know whether any *imprest> was given to the accused or not. <name/> was not the District *Vertinery> officer. He was the deputy. It was either doctor <name/> or Dr. <name/>.\nRe-examination:\nAccused was not the in charge of the *Vertinery> department. He was  a deputy MFI 3 referred to. The *imprest> was to go to Dr. <name/> for purchase of Vaccines (reads cut). MFI 5 speaks of district *Vertinery> officer Kitui. \nP. W. 12 ON OATH:\nNo. 215968 IP <name/> CID Headquarters Nairobi. I am the investigating officer in this case. Sometimes in July 1992 I *accampnied> CIP <name/> to Kitui where we were to carry out investigations at Kitui *interfracted> Development Programme after an audit report had come to us from Price Water House we collected the questioned documents. They  were several questions where the Price Water House confirmed were not genuine. Among them were some for *Vertinery> Department. There were receipts used to surrender some *imprest>. There was an official Government receipt No. AM 778788 for 50,000/= marked MFI 2 3. I went to the DC\'s office to confirm but the receipts found there were the same number was for only 10/= MFI 4. It bares the same number as MFI 3. There was also a receipt from Dawa Phamacuticlas for  20,567/= MFI 5. I went to Dawa Phamacuticals and the questioned receipt book appears to have no such receipt because it was torn out. I took MFI 6 from Dawa Phamacuticals. I also went to Nairobi *Vertinery> centre where I checked for the receipt No. 5350 dated 1.10.91 MFI 12. When I checked I found it was only for 5.70/= according to their counterfoil book. I took a photocopy of the counterfoil book which I got certified as a true copy of duplicate MFI 3. Since the ones concerned with the receipt denied I preferred the present charges against them. I produce also the specimen as exhibits which I gave to the document examiner. I produce them as exhibits exhibit I to 13 produced. Accused pointed out.\nAccused used to be a *Vertinery> doctor.\nP. W. 12 cross-examined by counsel:\nExhibit 3 and 5 referred to. According to my investigations the vaccines were not purchased. \nProsecutor close of prosecution case.\nCounsel in submission:\nAccused is charged with stealing by a person in employment.\nCount I *marrates> the vaccines were not purchased. As per the charge sheet they were purchased and stolen. Count 2 is of stealing various items but all were not purchased and also count 3. The evidence does not terry with the particulars of the charge sheet. Accused is not charged of stealing the money. In as long as it inconsistent with the particulars of the charge sheet the accused knew to sell the same. I urge the court to award the accused the benefits of doubts and a caution in number section 210 CPC. \nProsecutor In reply:\nExhibit 3 shows accused received an *imprest> of Kshs. 50,000/= as cash. Exhibit 5 shows the items were bought and received by the department so the question of the accused not to have taken the vaccines does not arise at all. The documents are all under evidence adduced by the prosecution warrants the accused to have a case to answer a case.\nRuling \nIn the course of 1991 I was the deputy to the District *Vertinery> Officer Kitui. There was a Programme *Foward> the Kitui Integrated Development, Programme. The Programme was funding *Vaccination> of companies within our development. For that reason the District *Vertinery> Officer would take *imprest> to fund the project from the programme. As a deputy there were *instutes> where I would take the *imprest> on behalf of the department. Regarding the case in question I was not involved in the taking of the *imprest>, nor in the surrender but in the course of the route investigations I was called upon to give and examination as to how the Fund had been utilised. In the course of 1992 I was transferred to Mukueni District so while there investigations were going on I was not in Kitui any more I was in Makueni district. When I was called upon to give an explanation I did not know why my name featured at all except that on one of the documents used to surrender present somebody had put my name on. It was an official receipt from the Government, of Kenya. From the evidence adduced it was became credible at no time was I involved in the request for the *imprest> or the surrender, neither in the purchase of the items and at no time has it been adduced in court I came across the stores or take away the stores where they were kept in custody. The storeman revenue clerk all stood on the *dook> and said I never came to *intoucher> of the stores or that the store was broken and anything stolen. I have no idea why I am standing here but somebody scribed my name on one of the documents. I am innocent on all the counts.\nAccused cross-examined by Prosecutor:\nI was the deputy to the District *Vertinery> Officer. My work was involved deputising and handwriting duties ie vaccination. Yes, I used to get assistant from the programme of vaccines, transport and other facities. Before getting the assistant we make a formal request with a budgetary not on the request. The District *Vertinery> officer made the requests but in his absence I would make my request. On 27.8.91 I did not apply for an *imprest>., or vaccine worthy 50,000/=. The district *vertinery> officer may have applied. He was on duty. He was Dr. <name/>. Dawa Phamacuticuals is one of firms that supply drugs. We have dealt with them directly. I did not make an order with them then, I did have a secretary in my office one Stella Munenen. I could delegate writing of some documents to her. I could go through them before they are dispatched. Exhibit 2 refereed to. It does have my name as doctor <name/> for *imprest> 50,000/=. It is an *imprest> from me. It is not signed. It does have a signature of a programme director. Exhibit 3 referred to. It is number AM 778788. It bares my name. It is for 50,000/= *imprest>. I do not know how my name appeared on the two documents. Exhibit 4 before court. It bares the same receipt number as exhibit 3. This is for 50,000/= and the other for 10/=. When we got shortage of receipts we would not go for them from the DC\'s office. I do not remember any witness saying I applied for the said *impresent>. I deny applying for *imprest> and never for forged any receipt.\nRe-examination: I never wrote exhibit 3 or even the name of it. I did not deal with the *reverant> documents at all. I never wrote  exhibit 4. My signature does not appear on exhibit 2. I did not fill the clearance form. I did not onion the 50,000/=. I did not buy the vaccines for my department. \nCounsel: I wish to submit in written form on 7.9.93\nS1BCE13K\nP. W. XTIAN MALE SWORN STATES:\nMy number is 38833 P. C. <name/> attached to CID Nairobi area autorobbery Unit. On 13.3.90 I and other officers got a report on robbery which had taken place at Nyeri town in a beer *Depo>. We got information that the thugs were more than five and that they had planned to hold their secret meeting in Eastheigh, section Three near Suncity cinema.\nWe then arranged for an ambush at the place. I was with Sgt <name/>, Sgt <name/> P. C. <name/> and P. C. <name/>.\nAt 12.45 p.m. a vehicle KPB 954 which is a taxi, arrived carrying the suspects. We stopped the vehicle and it stopped. There were four men and one woman in the car. We searched them and I got a toy pistol from one of them. We then took them to Shaurimoyo police station for questioning. On questioning them they informed us that the other thugs were waiting for them in Mathare Valley. The woman suspect took us to Mathare Valley and pointed out a house where their companions were waiting. When we neared the house one man came out of the house running very fast. Sgt <name/> chased him and arrested him.\nI Sgt <name/> and the woman suspect who was <name/> entered into the house in question. We found <name/> who is the man accused inside the house.\nAccused was *conceating> himself behind the door holding a pistol in his hand. We ordered him to surrender the pistol and he threw it onto the bed. We checked the pistol and found it was .38 special No. A24753 which is this one (marked MFI 1) No. 247553 loaded with six bullets. If the crimes we committed early I still could charge you with that charge plus another one (wit shown the charge sheet). Yes I can see this 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th counts on this charge sheet which alleges that on 2.4.90 <name/>, <name/> and <name/> committed three robberies using a pistol Webbly No. A24753 (charge sheet marked MFI D2) I agree your name is not on this charge sheet although the pistol is the same subject matter of this charge. I do not know that some other suspects were charged in connection with this same pistol. In January 1990 I was still in Nairobi. I agree we use VHT to inform other officers if a suspect is escaping. Before 30.3.90 I did not know you. I agree in the police station we keep a record of suspects we arrest. I sent you to Pangani police station then (proceeded to Nyeri). I do not remember telling a policeman in Pangani police not to book you. You were at Mathare not Karioko. \nRe-examined by prosecutor:\nI can see this MFI D I and MFI D2 I agree in the 6th count of MFI I and 2 this accuse is 6th accused in that case and the particulars says an 30.3.90 accused and others were armed with MFI 7th count also charges accused with possessing MFI I without firearm certificate I arrested accused on 31.3.90 not 13.3.90. I say 31.3.90 not 13.3.90.\nP. W. 8 XTIAN MALES SWOR STATES:\nMy name is Doctor <name/> attached to Nairobi police surgeon Nairobi. On 5.4.90 I examined PW I in a case of assault. I found he had a healed wound on right side of abdomen.\nHe had an operation on the abdomen and a repair of perforations in the intestines. The injuries were about 25 days old. They had been cause by a gun shot. He had been admitted at Kenyatta Hospital from five days. I assessed the degree of injury as *grevious> harm. I completed the P3 and signed it and I beg to produce it as exhibit 4. \nCross-examined by accused\nNil\nP. W. 9 XTIAN MALE SWORN STATES:\nMy name is <name/>. I am a firearm examiner attached to Firearm *labatory> of CID Headquarters Nairobi. My duty includes examination of firearms and ammunition and identification of fired bullets and expanded cartridges. This is a full time occupation. I have 18 years experience. I received the following exhibits from P. C. <name/> on 12.3.90.\nOne fired bullet which is this one (MFI 5) which has been shown to me by prosecutor. I received from supt <name/> on 2.4.90 the following.\nOne Webbley and scot Revolver serial No. A 24753 which is this one MFI I) shown to me by prosecutor. I have examined the exhibit referred to above. \nMFI is a Webbley and scot revolver in 32 calibre. Serial number A 24753. This revolver is in good general and mechanical condition complete with all its components and capable of being fired. It is not prove to accidental discharge. I have successfully tested fired the same revolver by using three appropriate calibre round of ammunitions from our store.\nThe fired bullets were all recovered, marked and retained for purposes of comparisons. These are the three fired bullets marked (T stands for Test). (bullets marked MFI 6). I formed an opinion that MFI I is capable of being fired and that it is a firearm in terms of Firearm Act Cap 114.\nMFI 5 is a fired bullet in calibre 7.65 mm and this is *eqquevalent> of .32 inches calibre automatic pistols. The said bullet is rather deformed. It would appear that the said bullet MFI 5 struck an object on impact and in the process it became so deformed.\nThe deformity on the same bullet has rendered some of the rifling markings unsuitable for comparative microscopic examination. I also found the same bullet was engraved with seven lands and groves which are the rifling of the burrow. \nThis bullet was microscopically examined and compared with each of the fired bullets  (MFI 6). From the *compatives> made, I found sufficient watching rifling striations to convince me that the MFI I had been used to fire MFI 5. I used pistol ammunitions to test fire MFI I because the bullet MFI 5 the type used or loaded in pistol MFI 5 was not *approrpriate> for revolvers.\nSummons to issue to executive officer R.M. <name/> to produce their criminal case file 2366/90 and chief magistrate execute officer to produce criminal case file 1 760/90, and 0/I Makongeni to produce him O.B. of 25.1.90\nOrder:\nOn application exhibit I 5 and 6 to be returned to DCIO Kasarani through PW 10 for custody.\nThe woman and the photographs should have been produced in court.

I work currently at Enterprise post office as Postal superintendent, for 7 years since 1985. I have worked for 19 years. In 1989 to 1990 I was attached to City Square post office as Ag. Senior Postal superintendent. My duties were I was the in-charge of cash A/Cs. Section and used to reconcile cash A/Cs. for City Square post office. Once the daily transactions were balanced e.g. saving deposits and withdraws etc., A balance PI.65 booklet was compiled by the cashiers. It is called a counter balance book. In it is reflected the daily transactions and it has to balance. It was a busy place and I had a support staff. They balanced and I had to verify. Another prepared a summary and we had to compare the figures. I verified the counter balances and the documents were verified by another office to ensure that the summaries were correct. Ref: This is a counter-balance book, MFI-16 it was held at City Square post office from 14.8.89 to 6.12.89. The book was held by <name/> and I knew him, he is the 2nd accused. He worked as a counter clerk. He was solely responsible for entries in that book e.g. on 2.10.89 he dealt with money orders. The book is balance and I verified and transfer these figures to summary transactions, P.270. I mark in red that it is balanced and I have to verify that the cash was given to the cashier. The tickings in red are mine, I over looked signing at "checked by".\nI did not sign although I checked due to pressure of work. Ref: MFI-17 book from 13.7.89 to 23.11.89. The book was for <name/>. Yes I knew her she worked as a counter clerk and she is the 6th accused. I checked this book and I did not initial due to pressure of work, though I checked it. Ref: MFI-18, it was held by our post office at City Square from 14.7.89 to 8.12.89. It was held by <name/> and <name/> from 13.9.89 and also <name/> &<name/> it is the 8th accused <name/> and he also worked as a counter-clerk. I checked it and it has my red marks. I did not sign it, I then transfer the information on P.270 form which had many columns for summary of daily duties and transactions. A 2nd person verifies the information and  it\'s put on ACI 107 form. It is brought to me for comparison, they are further transferred to AC.102 which is a cash A/C. balance sheet if they do not balance, then it s brought to the notice of the officer concerned. The counter clerk also comes and certifies if there is an excess form P2 242 is completed and SI 23 a misc. A/C issued. In case of a shortage form P2 41 is completed and the shortage must be paid by the officer concerned. Once the A/C has balanced,  it\'s taken to the head post master to check. We then dispatch it to our Divisional cash A/C. A/Cs and finance branch this book was held by many various people, due to several counter clerks taking over the same counter.\nxx. by Mr. <name/> for 1st and 6th Accuseds:-\nRef: MFI-17, and there is no initial of mine put on it. Apart from what I am saying there is nothing in the book to suggest I dealt with it except for ticks in red pens. A red pen has a normal pen for superintendents checkings this book. In the red pen I wrote the final amounts and not the accounts officials concerned. I did not sign for alterations of amounts from what time counter clerk had written to what I got from the supporting documents. As a result of the alterations I am responsible. The supposing documents are checked by somebody else and I was using them at the summary. The summaries come to me and I verify. I check the automatics only, later on I get the supporting documents and if they talk the same figure, it is okay. I have not seen the supporting documents now for this book.\nThe P. 270 is for transactions on 2.10.89, I filled it but  it\'s not here. It would tell us what the supporting documents talked about. For 1076 is a summary of savings transactions. It is brought to me to compare with my P. 270. I need all the documents to vouch for summaries in those books. \nxx. by Mr. <name/> for 2nd and 8th accuseds:-\nOn the morning of the next day is when I got the documents till noon. At noon the counter clerk comes and collects it i.e. the books - MFI-16,17, and 18. I was commenting for the counter-clerk to do what he had not done. I bring it to the notice of the counter-clerk and I expect a correction. MFI-18 at date 7.11.89, the cash and the stocks, they closed to work on 6th there and were handed over to another counter-clerk. This was made by the supervisor and not by me. They were handed over to the supervisor i.e. cash and stock for outgoing counter-clerk.\nxx. by Mr. <name/> for 3rd and 7th accuseds:-\nThis book is important in the accounting system of the post office. That in the procedure, for the supervisor to write in red it is permissible. Supervisors also use red pens as they are postal superintendents. I was acting then. I take to him the summarised i.e. the final A/C.\nI wrote the remark that I hope you are not covering any shortage by covering exceeding amounts. They were expected to keep 20/= as cash on hand and when I saw 120/= I made the comment, where the discrepancy does not exceed 5/= there is no much problem. Due to pressure of work I had not signed.\nxx. by the 5th accused:- NIL.\nxx. by the 9th accused:- NIL.\nxx. by the 10th accused:- Nil.\nRe-examination:-\nI am not responsible for figures in red as I changed them when there are changes on the documents by other persons, other than me. It is procedural for the supervisor to write in red especially when the counter clerk is going on leave etc., and the supervisor remains with his cash in hand for handing it over to the in-coming counter clerk. The counter-clerk is only supposed to hold 20/= but I had seen 120/= and I made the comment for future reference. I regret the *ommission> of my signature due to pressure of work.\nS1BCE15K\nP.W. 5 Adult male *xtian> sworn states in English\nMy name is <name/>. I work at the D.C.\'s office Isiolo as the District Accountant. I have been in Isiolo in that capacity for 3 years. From 1986 - 1990 I was the deputy district accountant. My functions are I am in charge of financial matters in the District. This involves receiving all the documents of all the departments processing payments wither by cheque or cash, collection of Revenue in the District and seeing that the revenue is surrendered to the treasury. My office was situated in the D.C.\'s office.\nDuring the course of my duties I came to know the accused as the District Trade Officer. He was a head of Department. He was taken round on the departments. He was in charge of the trade office and also the secretary and treasurer of the District form joint board. Yes we had money transactions between his office and mine, including payment of vouchers and cheques and the surrender of trade Revenue.\nThese two cheques were brought to me by the trade officer Mr. <name/>. He told me that the payees had no accounts so he asked me to encash the cheques. Cheques No. SISI/88 I36619 MFI 24 payable <name/> dated 21.2.90. Kshs. 20,000/=. I asked him to identify the payee so he <_/indorsed> the cheque that the payee was not to him and he signed it.\nThe second cheque is ISSI/88 I30620 MFI 23 dated 1.2.90 payable to <name/> of Kshs. 20,000/=. He also asked the same as above and I also asked him to identify the payee and he endorsed the cheque to the effect that the payee was known to him and he signed it.\nI paid them.\nAfter the cheques were paid by the cashier. The cheques were Referred to the Drawer because there was no money in that account. They were subsequently rebanked and honoured. On 23.8.90 the police recorded my statement at CID office Isiolo.\nCross examined by Accused.\nWe were not that close i.e. you and me i.e. socially.\nYes I was the deputy but any accountant can endorse the cheques. It is not true that you avoided the other accountants because I was your friend cheques can be presented by the payee or in the company of the head of department. <._>or in the company of the head of department\nIt is not possible to encash the cheques without the District  accountant\'s authority normally the head of Department may come personally or call or send a note requesting assistance for his friend.\nThe authority is for the payee but the person who identified the payee is responsible in case the cheque bounces.\nYes in the instant cases the trade officer committed himself. There were many *others> cheques endorsed for some of the people would come with the cheques, others you would come personally, or call or send a note requesting assistance for his friend, The authority is for the payee but the person who identified the payee is responsible in case the cheque bounces.\nYes in the instant cases the trade officer, committed himself. There were many other cheques endorsed for you some of the people would come with the cheques, other you would come personally.\nWith these 2 you came to the office.\nThere was no irregularity on the cheque and the cashier would notify the *physicall> identification of the payees.\nI  dont><don\'t> know what you discussed with Mr. <name/> (I.e. my boss) but he asked me to back the cheques it is normal practice for the trade office cheques to be cashier with us.\nRe-examined by CP:\nNIL.\nP.W.6: ADULT Male *xtian> sworn states in English:\nMy name is <name/> currently I work with D.C.\'s office Isiolo. I am the acting District cashier, my duties amongst others is pay and receive government Revenue. I have been in Isiolo from 1981 *upto> now, I worked in the present capacity from 1988. My office is situated within the DC\'s office. I have known accused since he reported at the District as the District trade officer and was introduced to us. He was also the secretary of the joint trade board My office and his had a lot of transactions they were correcting *alot> of Revenues which would be brought to our office.\nOn 23.8.90 I was called to the CID office in relation to some cheques <_/>cheques which I had paid. The first one 136619 21.2.90 payable to <name/> Kshs.20,000/=.\nThe trader involved was brought to my office by Mr. <name/> who was the District trade office. He told me that the traders had been given a loan by the joint board but they had no bank accounts and so he was requesting that he be paid from the treasury. Having looked at the cheque I noticed that it had been endorsed by all the signatories, and at the bank the Deputy District Accountant had also endorsed it for cash payment so I asked the payee to produce his ID card but he did not have it, so Mr. <name/> Identified him as being known to him so having no doubt that Mr. <name/> as the District trade officer knew the trader well I paid the cash to the trade. <Name/> signed the cheque that the payee was known to him. The cheque was for 20,000/=. Cheque No. 136620 21.2.90 to <name/> Kshs. 20,000/= it was also brought by a trader who was introduced by Mr. <name/>, he wanted the cheque cashed. This trader also did not have his ID card. I asked Mr. <name/> whether he knew the trader and Mr. <name/> said yes and identified him and signed at the back of the cheque. I paid the cash to our trader. The cheque Is number 136620. Mr. <name/> was signing. In his capacity as the secretary of the joint loan board. So I had no doubts because he was the one dealing with these traders and I knew that he knew very well. 136620 dated 21.2.90.\nIn the name of <name/>. The cheque was brought by a trader whom I  didn\'t know so after asking him for his ID he said he did not have it. So the trader went back to the District trade office and he came back with Mr. <name/> who identified him and signed at the back and put a Rubber stamp as well. And sure it had also been authorised to be encashed, by the accountant I paid it. I was familiar with <name/>\'s handwriting and signature, so I paid one cheque. Cheque No. 136618 21.2.90. Payable to <name/> for Kshs. 20,000/= who also did not have the identification card, He came in the company of Mr. <name/> who also identified the payee to me, after this, I paid the Trader 20,000/=.\nI paid the pension because there was an authorisation by the District Accountant and Mr. <name/> had identified the payee by signing and putting the official Rubber stamp.\nCheque 136615 name <name/> of 13.11.89. The payee did not come to my office in person. According to Mr. <name/> the payee had endorsed the cheque to be payable to the District trade Development office. So after the endorsement, Mr. <name/> had paid the payee from the Revenue collection of his office. So the cheque came into my possession as part of the District Development Revenues collection issued a receipt and a contra-cheque, for the Revenue collected by <name/>.\nCross examined by Accused:\nEven by 1989 I was the acting District Cashier. \nMy boss was <name/> the District Accountant. We normally encash pension and intentional cheques with authority. No cheque can be encashed without authority.\nPayment can only be given on with authority of the DC, DOC, District Accountant or his assistant, by signing at the back of the cheque. A trade officer cannot give authority to cash the cheque.\nHis signature at the back is valid for identification. Your signature was valid because the pensions involved were traders. Socially I met you only a few times. I paid the traders without their ID cards because you identified them as being well known to you, because the cheques originated from your office and you *propossed> the cheques of this people. I had no reason to doubt you since you were a senior Government officer. You came with the traders to my office . The cheques had ID card numbers on the cheques but they did not produce the ID card. I did not ask you to sign twice and I cannot recollect whether you signed in my office or in the  accountant\'s office. The fifth cheque was brought by yourself as part of your Revenue collections. This was not in order, but since it was authorised by the accountant I could not question him.\nI know one <name/> a clinical officer in Isiolo but he is not the <name/> that you brought to me.\nRe-examined by CP:\nYes I knew the accused very well and in the course of official duties Yes I was very familiar with his signature and handwriting, and he personally accompanied the payees and identified them.\n<name/>\nCOURT\n\nIt\'s 1230 p.m. the court has pleas to take therefore hearing to continue at 2.30 p.m.\n<name/>\n3.20 p.m.\nCoram as above\nP.W. 7 Adult male <-xtian> sworn states in English.\nMy name is <name/>. I am working at the DC\'s office Kitale as a District Accountant Before proceeding to Kitale I was in the DC\'s office Nakuru, Prior to this I was the District accountant in Isiolo.\nI went to Isiolo. In 1987 and transferred *begining> 1990, i.e. May 1990. During my tenure at Isiolo I knew the accused i.e. Mr. <name/> as a trade officer. We interacted in the course of our duties. His cheque 136621 21.2.90 payable to one Mr. <name/>, for Kshs. 10,000/= drawn on Isiolo trade Development Joint board.\nThere are no signature, for the trade officer and the DC. \nAt the back endorsed it for cash payment. Payee is identified by the trade officer I think this was before me. The cheque was brought by Mr. <name/>. He had presented it and requested that the <_/>the trader be paid cash. Mr. <name/> is that man (points) at the Accused). I asked him to endorse the cheque at the back and he did so. There is an ID No. on the cheque. At the time I was familiar with Mr. <name/>\'s handwriting and I he must have endorsed it in my presence. I had no doubt since he was the one dealing with this particular account, so after endorsing I gave the cheque back to him. This cheque No. 136618 drawn on 21.2.90 the payee is Mr. <name/>. The amount is 20,000/= both words and figures, the cheque is authorised by the officers *capurating> that account. At the back I endorsed it for encashment. The cheque was presented to my by <name/> and he endorsed that the payee is know to me.\nThere is a signature and official rubber stamp for the District Trade Officer. The cheques were presented for payment at the bank. For me to endorse a cheque I have to know the payee or they must be known to some other officer. In the instant case they were known to the payees. On 23.8. 90 I gave my statement to the police. And that is the evidence I am now giving before this court.\nCross examined by Accused.\nI went to Isiolo in 1987. I may not remember clearly whether I found you there or you found me there. I knew officially and as an individual. There were other accountants who could endorse, Cheques for cashing i.e. my deputies. Under special circumstances the DC or the DO could authorise. The DC was the overall boss and he would not have to call a meeting to inform us that he was authorising such payment. When I am authorising dealings with a departmental head I rely on him as long as I am satisfied that the cheque is properly drawn I *am> endorse it.\nThe cheque in question  was properly drawn. I authorised the payment. You must have come to my office from the dates on the cheques it is possible that they were presented to me on the same dates.\nI knew you as the person who had presented the cheques. I do not know <name/> on the cheque, that is why I asked you to identify him. Even if these people did not come with them I would endorse them since I was satisfied with you as someone known to me. I could have done the pace to any departmental near, you, signed the back in my presence. I do not know how the cashier paid. I do not know how the cashier paid the cheques. The cheques were properly drawn and you were one of the signatories so I could not suspect you of any foul play. It is possible that there are other cheques which I endorsed for you. The two cheques I have must have bounced at the first instance and honoured thereafter. I  don\'t recall whether the cheques came to me personally after they bounced.\nThey may have gone to *aother> officer. I had a deputy and assistant accountant and I had no reason to doubt them. It was *upto> the cashier how the payee identified himself at the point of actual payment. I had no reason to doubt you either I endorsed several cheques from other departmental heads.', 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '8e291b9f-0c98-4666-931d-b7e876d466c0', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.156060+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9876428842544556, 'non_english_score': 0.012357115745544434}

one\n<$?> We used to cram those things\n<$?> Leave alone cramming Mulao and their explanations \n<$?> We actually We knew what they were the saying But you had to know the meaning\n<$?> And even write a story about it \n<$?> You know uh You had to know you had to <ea/>jua \n<$A> Yeah they are very interesting\n<$?> \n<$?> \n<$?> \n<$A> Basic knowledge Knowledge for knowledge's sake It's true like \n<$?> But I think I think what we used to do in Seco We used to learn Here we are not learning Sure here <O/> your marks and you seriously here we're not learning\n<$C> No But Uh uh Yeah No it is true \n<$?> No\n<$C> The way I used to read in Seco me I used to read those things\n<$?> Let me tell you Let me tell you why you're learning whatever you're learning 'Cause you do something which really occupies your mind and you are really required a lot of thinking like accounts you ours it's <O/> <ea/>si I'll get this mark in this CAT or something like that Us we don't keep something in the head\n<$C> Application us guys have to apply a lot\n<$?> Us we have no continuation by the way 'cause it's like whatever you do this semester just ends \n<$?> Do you apply your GPA\n<$?> Well maybe <O/> administration but that is for people who will be in those public offices\n<$?> You are not going to be there\n<$?> <ea/>Si I'm a counsellor\n<$C> What grade do you \n<$?> you remember the <ea/>kanini you've just done now \n<$?> sexual harassment uh guys today the best topic that people would have wanted to go on until the end of the semester People have come up with their own ideas Lakini how can boys who've gone to school think like that Uh\n<$?> What are they saying\n<$C> What were they saying \n<$?> I mean there are obvious things like for example this story of *provocativeness> or you are dressed provocatively You it keeps coming up <ea/>ati you know that chick was she dressed provocatively but there are obvious things for example this story of uh that chick was raped because she dressed provocatively but it's all in the mind If I have dressed I mean I wouldn't wear something that is not decent you know So long as I'm dressed <ea/>i I <ea/>jua I'm decent yeah even if it's minis People wear minis please yeah \n<$C> What about if it is not decent\n<$?> But it's you <O/> you\n<$?> Are you an animal that if you see a lady's legs you just feel \n<$?> No exactly that is what the teacher said It is the animal instinct that takes over because really you are provoked as in you've seen and it's like okay those are nice legs <onom/>ooh she is \n<$?> Just appreciate\n<$?> Appreciate and move on You can admire and that's it Why do you go out of your way to grab her and rape her and then you say she provoked me and someone came up with this idea that this chick who was raped in Mombasa she was a Muslim in a bikini and you know the way bikinis are What would you say about that Was she provocative really no What was wrong\n<$C> What about What about women who rape men\n<$?> Okay there was all that they said \n<$C> No you have You never seen this movie called The Disclosure It shows how women when they are given power what they can do This lady was atop somebody She was an executive manager somewhere and then the guy\n<$?> She had a guy a small guy \n<$C> uh and the guy \n<$?> But that is not really rape \n<$C> It's just power If they are given power they also be raping men \n<$?> But let me tell you the woman by the way she'll be in that top position with the other workers you know what she will do she will make advances at you She will make you know She will not just come and tell you come in dress you and say or rape you know this way rape *rape> *rape> \n<$?> We women we have that shame We are not like guys have no shame and guys you see like I don't know \n<$C> It also depends on the character of somebody \n<$?> Can I tell you what the guy the woman by the way she'll be The women if given power they won't just come and rape you \n<$C> Yeah I It's because of culture But if it changes such that women are given now <O/> power I tell they will be on the street here they will be picking men like \n<$?> No But you see \n<$C> It's only that they're not as strong <O/>\n<$?> No but you see What is wrong with picking Listen There is nothing wrong with picking men What we are saying is big deal but the rape of a woman and the rape of a man are all different things You know why by the time this man is raped he morally has more or less succumbed You get because you see \n<$?> And a lady cannot rape a man by the way A lady cannot rape a man \n<$?> Yeah like in America It's like girls of our age have guns yeah \n<$?> People anywhere have guns\n<$?> In case you just try to do something she'll just shoot you She doesn't care\n<$?> <name/> said that what about a case where if people have guns then a woman can hold a man and unleash at gunpoint But honestly okay even the teacher said\n<$?> How\n<$?> At gunpoint okay I'm holding a gun to a man's head all right and I'm telling him to undress now it's definite that everything will shrink to use his words Let's face it one hand is holding a gun okay How will they do it\n<$A> I thought you were going to ask so that he can demonstrate \n<$?> I mean no I'm saying no I mean You've undressed So how are you am I going to rape you No you explain\n<$C> No you see now You see what happens now okay here is the gun okay somebody undress\n<$?> Yeah undress\n<$C> Yeah undress Now he throws away the gun and says he \n<$?> It's whatever it's a strong guy yeah",

{'text': "<$?> Yeah it will just be okay But a man a big man who knows what's going to happen to him at gunpoint You see that time you are in two different  situations Somebody is forcing you to do something that you can't in that case you will switch off But a kid There is no is noRRR way\n<$C> The same way The same thing\n<$?> There's no threat no threatRRR No threat at all\n<$C> There are threats no There are threats are threatsRRR Some of these kids of these kidsRRR are just carried by the maids <ea/>na <ea/>usiseme No it's true\n<$?> In fact can I tell you something that normally happens one for a maid to do such a thing <O/> it's like your sister you know it's someone they have <AmE/>gotten used to that is another point you have to take into account you see it's not <ea/>ati a maid a neighbour there who comes and rapes a kid of this house all right\n<$C> Sometimes it happens anyway\n<$?> No but more often than not it doesn't happen It's the maid of the house You know by the time the maid is getting to do these things on the boy he may not even think it's wrong let me tell you okay because \n<$?> The kid is so excited \n<$C> <ea/>Yaani and you rape some boy and she doesn't feel it's wrong\n<$?> The lady will feel it's wrong but the kid wouldn't know what's happening\n<$?> I'm not saying it's wrong but the kid will know what is happening because you can't \n<$C> Now No I'm taking a case whereby you know it's not just very small a boy like that maybe somebody like maybe standard four\n<$?> uh\n<$?> Even that is still a kid\n<$C> Yeah He's a still a kid He's still a kid but when somebody is in standard four like when I was in standard four that undressed like that so a boy like that one <O/> that one <ea/>ni <ea/>sawa now the maid gets in there\n<$?> Take a case where it's the maid who bathes the boy\n<$?> What if it's the maid who washes the boy\n<$C> The boy has faked an age whereby just wash yourself that time the maid gets in in that case is true \n<$?> Uh Let me tell you those ones happen to kids who are spoiled because the maid knows uh <ea/>mazee this one I'm going to wash him\n<$?> Yeah And before a maid actually in such she must really know there is a maid in our place not really our house but in the estate This girl there were two boys in the house She used to fondle the two <ea/>nyonyo you know fondle and then the kids they didn't know it was just normal \n<$?> It was just normal until then\n<$?> Until one time the mother of those kids came in all right and then the woman comes in and \n<$?> About what age were they\n<$?> They were small six years old about eight years old So when she came in she is the one who caught her in the act okay and of course she noticed let me tell you those kids now when they were being asked you know is when they kept now saying by the way they spilled everything oh she does this and this oh in fact she could tell them and then where on her <O/> you know at she is feeling sick \n<$?> It's good they don't know what they are doing\n<$?> Yeah you see\n<$?> And let me tell you they had apparently had done that on and on and on so you see like that kind of maid she could even rape those kids <ea/>ana <O/> do this Yeah it's rape but you see the kids were not bothered because they don't know \n<$C> Now me I had you know the issue of a maid when we talked about shrinking of a man when <O/>\n<$?> But if he is an adolescent or aspiring adolescent he those mechanisms might just you know\n<$?> go off\n<$A> go off or go on\n<$?> Oh At gunpoint <O/> you are there\n<$?> they at gunpoint <ea/>lakini the treatment will be just like that of a kid \n<$C> They will go off at gunpoint\n<$?> But surprisingly enough even at gunpoint I hear they can still let them up \n<$?> Who told you this \n<$?> Some men\n<$?> Okay Uh Olivia just like you by the way <O/> it's like put yourself in that situation somebody \n<$?> Guys A rapist he will let it up because if his work is raping he might even have it up all the time really \n<$?> \n<$A> Who was Which topic was it you guys were discussing I mean\n<$?> Sexual harassment in the public and private sector\n<$?> But does it usually have to go so far to be sexual harassment Even that touching of you are just passing\n<$?> No just insisting on a date insisting on a date making phone calls and telling people weird things you know That is sexual harassment It's not really the By the way the physical could be very minimal What they actually do to her you know could be minimal but just what you suggest looking at her suggestively you know looking winking those things flirting with people That is all sexual harassment\n<$C> And it's so common\n<$?> So the teacher decided we are being taught especially the men in our class\n<$?> Yes they need to be told\n<$?> So that they do not go out there and do this \n<$?> and do the same\n<$C> Now they should tell both of them \n<$?> But let me tell you \n<$C> I think those mini-skirts is harassment also so it should \n<$?> But <O/> let me ask you Let me ask you where is <O/> it coming now in the city <ea/>ama\n<$?> If you do not have self-control over yourself then it's your problem\n<$C> No you The thing is you are harassed\n<$?> Let me ask you Why is it coming now In the sixties our mothers used to wear these skirts wait \n<$C> They used to harass the men then \n<$?> Wait No How come they were not raped then \n<$?> By the way morals as now \n<$C> No there were sexual harassment because you are saying this whatever is sexual harassment\n<$?> No look at our tradition People used to wear next to nothing even in South Africa they still wear that just small skirts and nothing\n<$C> So now okay now What is sexual harassment then\n<$?> You guys you have no self-control you see\n<$?> Yeah\n<$C> No self-control We have\n<$?> But I told you I put on that mini by the way they even go to an extent of tearing it you know that means you can't control yourself because what you are seeing is not you want to see something more than that\n<$?> If your eyes Yeah Yeah \n<$C> No Okay now Uh you see now You are telling me about rape Us guys were talking about sexual harassment By the way what have you said what is sexual harassment \n<$?> It's It is It involves from touching commenting doing the real act without consent from the victim you know\n<$?> making passes at the victim without you know you are unwelcome but\n<$C> Now the psychological feeling of it \n<$?> That does not come in my dear Forget about psychological problems\n<$C> It is \n<$?> It isn't \n<$C> It is <ea/>kama a phone call is psychological it is just something that you\n<$?> It is not psychological because you we talk Let me tell you\n<$?> It's physical\n<$C> It's one <O/>\n<$?> No It is by the way you could call me and say Hi my dear How are you That's it you could call me and tell me please can I have a date with you that is harassing me if saying hello to me how can you be no That is not psychological\n<$C> Okay So what is psychological\n<$?> But you know Can I tell you something The psychological aspect of it you know the you in you as in you deal with it okay Now if you see a mini-skirt and straight away you think straight away your mind your evil mind the animal instinct in you is taking control because you would like by the way you see more and to see what is beneath that skirt\n<$C> By the way No Now I disagree with you I disagree with you uh\n<$?> You see a lady in mini-skirt It's like you already classify that lady as an object That's an object and what's in the object is what you want\n<$C> No It's what you see \n<$?> That is what you get \n<$C> Yeah uh No\n<$?> Not what you want to see\n<$C> Now you've seen You've seen somebody uh somebody in a mini-skirt \n<$?> What you see is what you get \n<$C> So you guys are not giving me time uh You've seen a lady in a mini-skirt okay And you know of course we are mature personally you know already <O/> that one now you are harassing me because now I know what those ones are meant for you know\n<$?> What are they meant for\n<$?> Meant for what\n<$C> You see It's the husband who is supposed to see these thighs you know not just anybody else You know these my thighs my <slang/>boobs are for the husband to see <ea/>sasa If somebody else sees them then that is harassment\n<$?> Sammy Let me ask you a question Where guys and babes swim together is harassment there You tell me\n<$C> No \n<$?> Cause you see now everything by the way You see almost everything Why \n<$C> It's the occasion\n<$?> Everything is an occasion\n<$?> No Someone can't wear a mini like that at daytime\n<$?> Can you tell me what is wrong with wearing a decent mini-skirt whatever to work official you look in fact they look <O/> very tough\n<$?> No I know the minis that you have in mind I know the minis that you have in mind It's not the one I'm talking about \n<$?> I'm not having a mental mini here or here with thigh sticking out\n<$?> You look very decent\n<$C> Yeah Then Me That's harassment \n<$?> The one in a <O/> <O/>\n<$C> Now that one becomes a different case all the same They are different circumstances\n<$?> Okay leave alone that Okay just \n<$C> Those are very different circumstances\n<$?> Okay If you insist Let me just correct you If you insist <O/> people wear minis okay in the instances where an old grandmother woman who is eighty years old is raped by some psycho even her she was wearing mini Even her she was very provocative according to Sammy because that is what you are saying\n<$C> Because of what she is wearing\n<$?> And let me tell you does she look nice\n<$C> Even a kid who doesn't <O/> is raped\n<$?> You want to tell me that man saw those withered thighs she wore you see a granny is wearing something <O/> the withered thighs just provoked him to go and rape her\n<$C> That's why okay That's why I said it depends on the occasion and the situation that someone is in\n<$?> Let's put it this way Sammy let me ask you Tell me \n<$?> That shows if you get so excited because of just seeing thighs that shows you have just adjusted your mind to the rape 'cause by the way you see those thighs are normal\n<$C> You know it becomes normal yeah \n<$?> You see in abroad how comes babe and you see\n<$C> It is with time It is with time No There is nothing like that\n<$?> No Let me tell you that is nothing \n<$C> That is nothing because they have been used to it They have been used to it\n<$?> You get 'cause \n<$?> You have better get used to it \n<$C> No Yeah To get used to it now you have to change adjust to change \n<$?> How do we change you by wearing long skirts How do we change you by not wearing <O/> \n<$?> the time it changes because we will have raped enough people\n<$?> But let me ask you Okay That shows you guys are weak because \n<$C> Us guys are not used\n<$?> us guys can see you in shorts and nothing happens It's normal",

had never known I decided the best thing is not to say hello and even him on that note he just looks at me <O/> he looks at me though a *grinnish> look you know uh Even he grins all the time Even the other some guy told me is that guy grinning at you or something I told him uh that is Mwangi I mean please it's okay I just didn't know how to react\n<$B> But I guess now he's quite normal It's only

are held you are supposed to be loved \n<$E> No listen Show me love They are professing it in whichever way they want to It's okay\n<$A> There are many ways of killing a rat\n<$E> Yeah Uh I mean that is one of them Especially maybe they didn't actually think someone was watching\n<$A> He's also <ea/>Luo\n<$E> \n<$C> That guy\n<$E> He's <ea/>Luhya\n<$A> See this is that lady\n<$E> But listen guys these you people let me tell you one They you know They describe people by that day that one that story that \n<$A> No for this one This lady had a bad whatever when we were together Besides her sister was my classmate\n<$B> Francis let me ask you Anything you see around these parts of Moi University or you hear or you are told you have to tell Jwan and it's bad\n<$C> No that's not true \n<$E> By the way they are all of them are like that We told Alex a very confidential story Alex <ea/>tu to the boys\n<$A> I got that story from you Olivia\n<$E> Okay the boys \n<$A> So it's wrong It's inaccurate to say that Alex told it to us be specific \n<$E> By the way you know If you really value that story as in if you <ea/>hee Me I was so worried like by the way but the subject in question like I said before and I always say like I couldn't care less whether he got to know or he didn't It's okay In fact maybe it would do him a bit of good That is good\n<$A> This is your granny\n<$B> No That is a sister of my mum\n<$C> Why do you say that uh Why did you say that Judy that's bad\n<$B> Francis always tells you\n<$E> Let me loyalties It's just <O/> the way uh please It's uh I if someone uh uh uh it would be weird to tell Claire something and then tell her but don't tell Olivia anyway\n<$B> But maybe sometimes somebody \n<$E> Certain most of the things I don't think they are things I wouldn't know even if she doesn't tell me No Okay that what I'm saying very minimal but these other story <O/> <O/> that way okay\n<$B> But imagine if somebody tells me I'm telling you something and please don't tell anybody \n<$E> Okay That is confidentiality which okay But what I'm saying is there are those moments of course there are those things you discuss the two of you and those are stories between the two of you But now when it comes to story like I saw so and so I met who in this and that you know such \n<$A> No there are some of these things are highly confidential\n<$E> Bu Yeah But some of these that's what I'm saying like now this one they are not that confidential\n<$B> But you see Francis unless I tell you this is a secret and don't tell anybody even Jwan You will always think that it's not very serious so you will go and tell anybody even Jwan\n<$A> No but you see\n<$C> Do have any \n<$A> You see what happens here is that there can be a time where a topic can arise and maybe you want to compare like and like But I'm just not going to come from the blues and oh Olivia was saying this and this We can't gossip like that That is tantamount to gossiping\n<$E> No it's just that You know That day Yeah You know why we said that In fact we remember after discussing that story so we said We told Alex uh <ea/>haki I hope you are not going to tell your buddies because and we let me tell you what happened 'cause even them I'm sure they will say these girls Then anyway in the end we said anyway big deal because really that is not the case that's not how it happened And you know Alex told us <ea/>ati uh how could I do that surely uh you know until I  linked up with Jwan and he was asking me you know he was and then he was asking me it's not bad but I just thought our mouths\n<$C> Oh it depends on what you discuss I know the story already\n<$E> Okay But that one was uh By the way that one In any case it's a story I had wanted we had just forgotten so that time we saw him like this we just remembered by the way you know even if it was not Alex we would have told any other person because that story we had decided surely we have to tell these boys You know one at least we were burning with it but then we forgot uh\n<$A> This was good\n<$C> This was the day of the <ea/>harambee \n<$B> <ea/>harambee \n<$C> The last one or\n<$B> No that's <ea/>kitambo Those are A-Levellers by the way\n<$C> Oh Okay\n<$B> I'm not sure\n<$C> Even this one is a long time one\n<$B> Which one \n<$E> By the way Irine went home\n<$B> Uh\n<$E> \n<$B>

problem\n<$A> Yeah <ea/>sawa So uh I was telling you uh when we left uh we leftRRR that uh Kenyan Ugandan students discussion uh I was giving somebody a push down to her hall twelve Now uh this babe doesn't know  these sides yeah <ea/>si <ea/>ndio And then uh I told her so you follow like this First she saw a dead rat yeah and then she \n<$?> Where was that\n<$A> she screamed just outside hall five outside near the booth She screamed and I asked her Hey what's the problem <O/> So we went down <ea/>mpaka between hall six and hall seven <ea/>si you know there is a <ea/>penya where you just squeeze\n<$C> Hall six and seven\n<$A> Yeah\n<$D> Yeah yeah there is a <O/> \n<$B> That route which we used to \n<$D> The route \n<$A> that <ea/>kiroute over there So I was taking her through there and then we come out into that AGD field yeah That field that faces it between hall six seven and eight and AGD And then we go through AGD and then she drops <O/>\n<$D> Okay that bushy field\n<$?> <ea/>basi\n<$?> Okay\n<$A> Now see you <ea/>fika there I told her we go right And then she's like uh wait a minute <ea/>bwana where you uh where are you taking me And I was like uh I mean you don't trust me and I anyway I mean I was hurt honestly speaking 'cause I mean where did she did sheRRR think I was taking her and to do what with her honestly \n<$B> Okay\n<$A> Yeah uh okay I understand her sentiments but uh uh please I mean trust is just the best thing \n<$D> Okay just a minute\n<$B> For how long have you known the lady\n<$A> No not that I really know her so much I mean we are classmates we were classmates and uh we are acquaintances so uh \n<$B> You didn't expect such a reaction\n<$A> I was it was a little bit too much for me as you know Would I Okay to some extent she was right in that uh uh you have to find out where you know uh where somebody is taking you but on my side I mean it was hurting <ea/>bwana I mean if you just don't trust me 'cause she actually was waiting for <name/> <O/>\n<$D> Yeah\n<$A> Now she was like uh Why don't we go down together until the willow has disappeared Now she had gone So she was like see you give me a push I have no problem So in the process of giving her a push on the way didn't trust me I was so disappointed Anyway that's life Those things do happen\n<$D> In fact I was about to tell you that today I closed a file <O/> uh uh Oscar told me to postpone this story till now uh There are other crises\n<$?> <O/>\n<$D> I have not told you while I was waiting for you \n<$B> Which story is that\n<$D> <O/> I can say I have made two major decisions in my life for the past three days These three days that have *past> I made two major decisions Booting friends You have the wish to keep them but your mind stroke brain wants to boot them because they are kind of infringing \n<$B> Your principles\n<$D> Yes exactly\n<$A> When they do uh uh you will just have to but you take a choice you know\n<$D> What can you do for example let me give you a very practical example It's like this You give somebody your notes personal notes Then you tell her please bring these notes tomorrow morning She brings them in the evening Then what happens is this once she brings them in the evening you ask her what happened She tells you that I had not finished with your notes Is that a that aRRR very good reason for not returning your notes Then what happens is this when I go for a Kiswahili lecture and then I bounce a philosophy lecture I come and tell her Can you give me your notes so that I can go and copy in fact it was the lecture about the end of a human act Then she says No Reason She gives no reason Then today I told her very early in the morning that that time you were telling me that you will have that There was some reading going on here \n<$B> Okay I know the situation I decided to keep away\n<$A> You read between the lines yeah\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> <O/>\n<$D> He had to do because I called her and then I told her that I want to talk to you but Yeah let's talk Uh Therefore I told her like this \n<$B> And then you received her \n<$D> Very simply it's like this You requested my notes I got angry when I got your message that you had written that I promised you that I'll give you my notes That was not true because I did not promise you I just said probably I'll bring my notes tomorrow meaning on Friday evening Then I said Okay that's it We went and then I also added that uh is what I said therefore your promise according to the philosophy of language a promise it means a lot it means a lot There is a difference between promise and probability Therefore I said okay that's what I said Therefore you are wrong on that in writing that message in fact Therefore I said \n<$B> You didn't promise her \n<$D> I didn't promise Therefore I still I asked her do you still want the notes Yes But I love to make you remember two incidents that happened in second year And you'll tell me whether or not I'm just finally giving you my notes\n<$B> Okay\n<$D> Then I started Okay one time I gave you my Mazrui notes in fact I had mentioned that thing in class on Thursday And I said okay I'll give you my notes What happened <O/> how long did I stay with your notes I told her that uh you stayed with my notes for more than eight hours and each and every minute means a lot to me What was the end of the first incident Then the second one I told her about those uh notes she refused to give Said that I can't remember You know what I told her I'm very sorry I don't like this but I'm very sorry to have such a memorable mind I just I don't I just don't want you to remember things It's very unfortunate but I have a very vivid memory \n<$A> You mean clear memory \n<$D> Yeah A clear memory not a vivid one And then I said okay that's it \n<$B> That's the first uh one of the major decisions\n<$D> Yeah And then she took off hungrily\n<$A> And there goes a friend but anyway you know what uh at the end of the day I was telling this guy Me I believe if you've done the right thing it's okay because if that's the kind of a friend she is where everything just rotates around and about her her interest then uh you are better off relegate her to an acquaintance \n<$B> Surely\n<$D> Sure\n<$A> And that's as much as it stands right now because if she comes back to <ea/>gus with you I mean I don't think you would refuse her but still you'll you have established your limits you have established what kind of a person she is and uh that's the most important thing\n<$B> And I think this a major I may presuppose that this a major tendency that uh most of our ladies here uh uh are fond of acquiring some sort of or using\n<$C> You see they are not out to assist you In most cases you find it that it's a one way kind of traffic kind of relationship uh She She's not \n<$A> But that's the society Everyone is just opportunistic you know\n<$D> Why\n<$C> Where can we place the blame now Because for one thing they have been fighting for equality and with this equality that they are fighting for me I believe that you first have to level the ground and make sure that everything is at par such that whatever she gets if she gets fifty I also get fifty And it should be what we've all worked for individually \n<$A> But you see there's this question yeah somebody was posing uh the Kenyan the Nairobian lady I mean we are working in the accounts department She earns as much as I do And she has the audacity to come and tell me Hi Oscar Hi How are you <ea/>nzuri Take me out You know I mean We uh We earn the same yeah Buy me lunch Let's go for Take me for a movie Please I mean it's not like I have any extra shillings above what she has yeah But they're always on the receiving end even when their salaries are the same you know they are getting the same <O/> and the same allowance or you know uh \n<$?> e t c \n<$A> I'm just a Kenyan anyway \n<$C> The problem is this they claim that One they have a lot of things which cannot be met by their salary Secondly they say that it's better they utilise our money instead of us taking that money to a bar You see such kind of bizarre reasons \n<$A> But you see yeah They always try to make it uh their us-conscience you know <ea/>ati conscience for us in saying that rather than you go to the bar and waste your money down there and you know you stand a risk of let's say getting drunk being mugged and you know so instead of like even saying you bring your you put your money to something that's useful that's <slang/>gonna come back to you spend it on them that's a better investment you know \n<$D> You know that therefore you cannot say that this gender equality thing I don't think <O/> it can work in anywhere in this world What we can have is gender equity There is no way she can come and claim that to spend my your money on me that is a better investment it means implicitly that she's like just starting a business You invest too much in her \n<$B> And given the fact that some of them have been letting many guys uh down\n<$D> Yeah\n<$B> You might even invest the way they take it to be And finally she gets married to someone else So you end up losing \n<$A> By the way By the way that's normally how it is yeah I've come to realise they quite know You find <ea/>ati <ea/>ati I'm pushing with a certain lady We've gone out for a couple of years by the way This time me I am going out with her like let's say tonight we <O/> in a movie theatre Tomorrow I buy her lunch we walk in <O/> place and feeling many times there's another guy much older than me He's buddy busy reading a accounts or reading you know law he's finalising his profession <ea/>Ama he's busy now just entering into the profession <ea/>ama you know in his career He's setting <O/> And then once he get the he gets the economical you know the financial standing Now you just come and <O/> her off from here and you know she goes and You can imagine how when you backtracked with this date <O/> And I was still shining with her and you know and someone was busy making you know colours <O/> for her and uh\n<$C> I think we have a Somehow we have committed a fallacy We cannot generalise the talk because there is this thing called love Money can't buy me love \n<$A> Yeah but it's true but in the sense that she

I said however much the <O/> relationships may not necessarily so much so be because of the economic bit of it it could be love but still the fact is the babe I'm pushing with today chances of me marrying her are not anot so high Okay probably for the age yes but you know those that teenage thing it's normally just popular you know You start Hey this is my babe Shortly you change to somebody else and then somebody else You know \n<$B> And me if such a thing would happen to me I don't abstain totally \n<$A> It's so natural why not It's just like you <O/> and then you came to <O/>\n<$D> abstain from what Opela\n<$B> From making friends <O/>\n<$A> No I mean it's so healthy to it's there is no problem The only y fact is it's a reality like okay I've had a girlfriend Now the

Oh okay The marriage was postponed or rather put off \n<$?> Indefinitely \n<$B> Uh In this case what can you do You just indulge but you make sure that you don't indulge so much But the problem \n<$A> No you make You make friends you make uh You actually uh I personally I believe it's healthy I mean you learn so much So that when you have the person you're really you know uh serious with you'll not be making some funny errors \n<$D> In fact that was what I \n<$C> I'm not a person who makes trials and errors You make a trial and it's the thing the real thing You are very serious about it And you play your part even if the part is not played by the other party Then it's not a mistake \n<$B> This is why I'm saying that there is a problem We don't know where to draw the line between uh the real the Okay if I may use the term courtship <O/> this discussion\n<$D> Yeah\n<$B> If we can't draw that line it is difficult to draw it and maybe to identify someone who is not wholly committed If it's the man he might be cheating the lady that oh you know whereby you are the one and you are mean a lot to me and such like sweet nothings if I may say so If it's the it's theRRR lady she might also put all the all those kinds of words whenever they meet one another But finally one of them is going to disappoint the other yeah There's a problem you can you can't tell who is cheating and who is giving true love\n<$D> Therefore you've identified the problem <O/>\n<$B> You can't Okay this is what I'm trying to get from you I'm saying that it's hard for me to draw that line so what can you do \n<$D> Between a problem and a solution or between problems\n<$B> Okay it is between uh uh Maybe you did not get me clearly or maybe I'm not the one who is getting you clearly I'm saying it's very difficult to draw a line between the one who is uh giving true love and one who is cheating the other\n<$A> You are right Because me honestly speaking okay some relationships me I look at them like this uh I just wonder I mean uh is it for conveniences purposes or is it for the fact that we are in this age so in this age people normally have girlfriends so even me I have one <O/> some just don't think serious you know Okay some look serious but you can just see that honestly is isn't it they are you know like uh skewed you know it's *bended> on one side and you know someone is I don't know\n<$D> But on this line I think I can support ladies because most people who are serious about relationships <O/> courtships they are ladies <O/> Guys are never serious \n<$C> <O/> Can you substantiate \n<$D> I have a lot of friends who tell me how they can probably uh This lady she's just there for a short short-term basis and then I know the person I will marry Not this kind She's just here to I don't know The guy is biding his time Therefore but for ladies you approach a lady and ask her How do you think about your guy She'll tell you that is the guy of my dreams probably imagining getting one of his sons or daughters They think very far But for guys I'm telling you they just see someone very close either just for marriage \n<$A> <O/>\n<$D> I I'm saying most guys not all guys I'm making myself clear Most guys And most people who are serious I repeat once again are ladies about relationships Though if you find some who are not serious that is ladies then just regret why you fell in love in the first place Because they can torment you uh\n<$A> 'Till all hell breaks loose \n<$D> Otherwise we'll have to wait and see Experience is \n<$B> the best teacher\n<$D> Yes \n<$?> <O/> best lecturer \n<$D> the best lecturer\n<$B> <O/> I think there's this thing we wanted to talk about What happens when a person dies \n<$A> <O/> uh see I saw you in the student centre You came briefly and disappeared \n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> What was not happening\n<$B> What I expected was not happening \n<$A> What did you expect\n<$B> I expected \n<$A> What did you get\n<$B> Yeah surely and uh uh in this situation I thought that uh maybe it was supposed to be a meeting between those uh visitors from Makerere University \n<$A> they meant it to be a meeting uh and then\n<$B> between Makerere students and uh <O/>officials or <O/> members\n<$A> Okay\n<$B> So and I went there and found out okay it was some kind of a just a general discussion okay involving uh students from all units uh I mean all courses and all associations within the university So I was not expecting that and therefore I paused for a for some time and tried to listen what they were discussing about and I could not catch up with it and I just left again\n<$A> Uh we were discussing pan-Africanism What do you think of pan-Africanism \n<$D> On pan-Africanism I can talk a lot courtesy of\n<$A> Generally\n<$D> Professor Ali Mazrui I know \n<$A> Shortly Briefly\n<$D> Very briefly pan-Africanism should I say at initially it was a Negro movement but nowadays it's a movement of governments in Africa in the Caribbean \n<$A> Okay a movement of governments but what are you going to boil down is that does pan-Africanism really exist truly speaking\n<$D> You know it depends from which school of thought you are arguing from If you are a Eurocentric definitely you will say that this thing is a myth If you are Afrocentric you will say it's a reality Do you know why even these scholars we think that they <O/> They have some kind of bias whereby if from a Eurocentric perspective you cannot argue that pan-Africanism is a reality Mazrui argues from an Afrocentric and says it is a reality and we have five types of pan-Africanism and goes out to delineate  these kinds of pan-Africanisms whereby we have this uh sub-Saharan pan-Africanism about the black country scene black Africa the so-called sub-Saharan Africa We have this other one which links us with these people who are uh Arabs \n<$B> The northern\n<$D> Yeah the northerners by arguing that though there is the Sahara desert in between \n<$?> <O/>\n<$D> Yeah the this this Sahara desert is more of a bridge than a death trap When you go to the Caribbean islands we find that there is this western-hemispheric pan-Africanism whereby we have uh these people coming together having uh unions that can uh cater for their welfare because of being enslaved together \n<$B> That is which region \n<$D> The western-hemispheric region Caribbean islands and that kind of things Then we have this kind of transatlantic pan-Africanism whereby the black Americans or the so-called African-Americans nowadays link up with  these sub-Saharan and trans-Saharan pan-Africanists and argue that uh we are all blacks We've been through hard times together These governments have been very rough to for us And then the whole thing is encompassed in the global pan-Africanism And that is what I think Oscar is asking about And therefore it all depends from where you are arguing\n<$B> School of thought\n<$D> Yeah \n<$A>But how is the consciousness Pan-Africanism viewed as  a> consciousness was a was more or less a psychic spiritual thing you know You are conscious of uh your values as blacks you know as uh you try to bring that unity amongst you a unifying factor which is a uh being from Africa being black and uh having finished you know marginalisation in terms of economic and uh political stress from the outside world yeah Just how much Just how much of that is in in theRRR in theRRR common man today \n<$D> One problem is that in Africa especially Africa sub-Saharan Africa we have a problem with culture You know culture is a very simple word that people just pass by But if you sit down and analyse what culture is all about you come to realise that in sub-Saharan Africa we have a cultural crisis identity crisis whereby people disrespect their culture And this is unheard of in any part of world People are very very uh serious about their culture But in Africa we have a problem People don't want to identify with their so-called traditional beliefs simply because they've been told these beliefs are primitive uncivilised barbaric You name them Therefore without first of all sitting down and reconstructing what was destroyed by colonialism and its predecessor uh slavery and such kind of things or its successor neo-colonialism right now I don't think we are going anywhere This is a problem that faced African countries on the eve of independence Instead of these leaders sitting down and discussing how to reconstruct this culture that has been that had been at least destroyed by all those years of colonialism they embarked on trying to achieve economic dreams for example industrialisation without taking into consideration that these people have to be sensitised that they are black They have to be sensitised that they have a common cause with the other blacks in all those spheres Mazrui observes We just have to sit down and we say okay Minister of Finance do something about the budget Do something about this Therefore there is no way people can be conscious of pan-Africanism and yet we do not do something about our culture And that is why it doesn't have a a lot of adherents in Africa \n<$B> And just to add on what you are talking about maybe if I may go to the grass-root level that even to identify ourselves uh with our own nation-state has been a problem in some of the African states such that uh there is this factor that has been hindering this consciousness at the larger level of I mean pan-Africanism at that level because one thing ethnicity is a major factor People do identify themselves in most cases with their ethnic groups and the ethnic origins rather than with their own nation as a whole first of all I mean nation-state And uh it's from this level whereby we uh might come together and uh okay As a result of this *conscienceness> we might come together and uh uh be unified as blacks within Africa or blacks within the ethnic continental level So ethnicity is a major hindrance \n<$D> Okay \n<$?> Okay we\n<$D> What were they discussing there\n<$A> Somebody presented a paper so-called a paper She talked about pan-Africanism Then\n<$B> Was she from

{'text': "<$A> You know there are things like we wouldn't we would yeah uh you wouldn't take your grandpa to a grandfather uh grandparents' home That concept hasn't quite dawned on African society And when they come visiting they'd still be treated with you know that kind of respect you know that that's the thing that's in uh that that's not physical culture as such But what remains like when you just look around Okay physical or uh uh the non-physical culture There's so much of it exists even like in this hall of ours If you just take each and every individual and you can quantify that okay he has this measure of culture our traditional culture in him still Just what you know What percentage of uh the population in let's say the students in this hall would come up <O/> where they still hold our culture dearly and I mean from the onset you just look at it it looks like it's fast eroding It's eroding pretty fast \n<$B> Very fast in fact even the percentage is really insignificant You can't\n<$A> Okay probably that that's uh regional uh But that as much as we are here we never see any of that But then when you do start travelling around you definitely see those huts grass-thatched roofs you know and that's physical culture you see And then uh very many other things but you'd agree with me that in the first place yeah so much of it has been lost where like you uh think about when uh some communities would go to the shrine to worship uh a certain traditional god You know when uh probably some cultures still hold it in that for them when someone dies there's just so much you know uh so muchRRR so muchRRR don't dos and dos that have to you know go about with the funeral but still at the end of the day they have changed yeah There's some dynamism in it It probably isn't what it used to be you know like for the Luo when they say they really cherish funerals yeah but probably it's not what it used to be exactly you know taken back to three generations uh I think \n<$B> It it's quite different in a way\n<$A> I think it uh funerals used to be something <O/> Well we can't blame anybody when there's a strong influence from another culture what would you expect Or what do you guys think\n<$D> What I think about this whole affair of culture is that we're the problem In fact it's identified by Professor <name/> that when these people came they came with their own culture And the African culture was supplanted by this foreign culture And in order I think in order to try to re-establish what was in fact my my prime objection is we miss immaterial culture erosion Not material culture as such Material culture has nothing to do with it What is immaterial is always more important because it reflects how you think how you respect people how you obey them such kind of things the way you dress There is no problem with this European dress The problem is how we and when we wear these things because the \n<$?> <O/>\n<$D> Yeah For example mini-skirts It was in the immaterial culture of the Africans most Africans that a lady should not display her thighs The European brought a long dress and a short one Now where is the problem If she wears the long dress she will have betrayed the material culture of wearing skins When she wears the short one she betrays both you see the material and immaterial culture This is where the problem lies \n<$A> Okay like now uh there's this thing about wife inheritance In light of what you know would you like uphold such a culture\n<$C> There is no problem with wife inheritance\n<$D> In fact I was at Mary's place \n<$B> Okay\n<$D> and I had to run away from that discussion because it was Mary and another guy called <name/> They introduced that wife inheritance And I was quiet for around seven minutes listening to them\n<$B> That's a very long time\n<$D> because there was one day this the Philosophical Students' Association held this debate about <O/> and <name/> presented a paper yes And then we discussed that paper for around two hours and <name/> said this so-called wife inheritance is a connotation from a Eurocentric point of view What we have is a companionship He used very good words \n<$B> to refer to that practice\n<$A> I think that is clothing quinine in sugar\n<$D> We have uh Yeah \n<$A> <O/>\n<$D> Therefore he said it's wife guardianship family guardianship a lot of terms \n<$A> I think okay did he specify what the so-called quote unquote wife inheritance implies\n<$D> The whole affair Briefly he said it like this A wife who is a widow uh may decide whether or not even according to the Luo traditional customs whether or not she will be inherited quote unquote And if she decides she will be inherited she decides among the brothers of the clan she is in You know he was arguing for \n<$?> <O/> \n<$B> I think no I think what it should be or what it used to be is this that it was like this When the husband died the widow had no choice other than being inherited because for one thing she was regarded yeah she was regarded as the property I mean as the member a member of that family you see In fact he was married to \n<$A> <O/>even when he is alive The minute you get married in the African culture or rather in the Euro-culture we became part and parcel of the family where the man comes from\n<$D> That is true That is what Mr <name/> said\n<$B> Yeah he said so\n<$A> To an extent that when you die you cannot be buried by your dad You're buried by your in-laws Yes to the extent that when he dies someone has to Okay there are virtues that went with it This guy who inherited you was there to take over the roles of the brother providing for you you know uh taking care of you and his children And in any case fulfilling each and every role that goes with it\n<$C> Yeah that is what I understand I can remember very well\n<$A> But you see at the end of the day I <O/> He defended <O/> guardianship or what calling it wife inheritance is not a really Because after all uh what is inheritance When my dad dies I take over his empire yeah And it's a business empire for manufacturing textiles I take over and I'm the boss now I'm the man \n<$D> Yeah\n<$A> And uh from henceforth the decisions that have <O/> are made for by me In other words I run the company So by me inheritance inherits the wife he assumes each and every role so to speak\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> And provide for the children and give advice Well you know after all your my wife <O/>\n<$D> Yeah I remember that that discussion took two hours and when we were standing with Mr <name/> outside there in that corner then we discussed for another two hours The questions are these In fact Mary was asking <name/> <name/> is a Luo\n<$?> Uh\n<$D> A\n<$A> Oh Mary Mary is a Luo uh\n<$D> Yeah Does the present situation in the country call for such kind of customs to be continually you know practised by these uh You know the society has changed She was arguing the society has changed Therefore Does the present economic situation justify such a condition if at all the wife is in a position to sustain her family \n<$?> Uh\n<$D> React to that \n<$A> What I would say is I mean you don't need we don't need the economic conditions as such to make us lose that one Supposing uh she was able to or supposing she was not able to Don't you think like the thought today's thought process who do you marry you marry I marry someone I love \n<$C> Yes that's true\n<$A> You marry y someone you love to the extent that your dad would tell you marry Jane You go and get your Anne wherever you fished her from Whatever is in her that made you like her whatever is in you that made her like you it's all up to the two of you it's mutual That's what matters You get married Now your younger brother here gets married to so and so Okay Yeah Now your younger brother's wife dies So would you inherit her even if it's not the economic factor With today's kind of reasoning and uh viewpoint towards <O/> First of all if uh you are for it then you'd be much so a or potential polygamist to be able to think of having two wives yeah And then for me to think of taking my younger brother's uh wife to the full extent I mean we can help her that one is for sure I mean she's part of family Yeah if she really cannot economically we can chip in economically and help economically But not to the extent of bringing her to my house or you know integrating her into my blood family and You see \n<$D> Yeah I understand\n<$A> It's also a matter of if you're marrying because I think before you you'd actually even know your bride on the last day as in far taking it very much behind \n<$?> According to the African tradition \n<$A> You never used to choose as such The ladies never did have a choice as such You are just being told uh you come from a family that is well known to be you know doctors There's another family there who are doctors as well or blacksmiths and blacksmiths and you know It will be done for you like I know he's got a very good son It's a reputable family and we'd like to have association with and you have no choice You see at that time the individual wasn't really prepared\n<$B> <O/> \n<$A> It was a social thing so that even if you You see first of all your wife was brought to you So if you are brought for another one then who cares <O/> you go out and choose And you say I just cannot have a relationship with Anne because she is x y z I can have with so and so because I like this thing about her I like this personality about her I love her You know Then when someone pours off another lady to your side to call your wife you wouldn't accept it whether it's economical also or not you see You get my point \n<$D> Yeah we understand you \n<$C> You can Can you <O/> this yeah How about in a situation whereby somebody plans the death of this husband eyes the wife and conspires \n<$A> You see okay\n<$D> Nowadays \n<$C> I don't care about nowadays\n<$A> However good the wife inheritance thing was as per \n<$D> Those days \n<$A> This guy who you were talking to \n<$C> Okay\n<$A> <O/> One thing is for sure that it had its negative effects I mean what is if my y brother has married a cute wife \n<$D> \n<$A> uh wouldn't I wish for his death You wouldn't be surprised <O/>\n<$B> You can't avoid it Even if you suppress it that is still there in you that at least you have that feeling that you \n<$A> You wait till he dies you know You'd be so willing to take over \n<$D> But do you know there is a lot of responsibility that goes with this so-called wife inheritance let uh alone the role You know there is only one role people think about \n<$A> There there's so much There's so much\n<$D> How about the other things I think I can show her from \n<$B> This is why \n<$C> Because of other responsibilities\n<$A> But you see Okay you might shy away but shy away but one thing is for sure like as we were saying if it was mandatory it's another thing <O/>\n<$D> obligatory\n<$A> Yeah and after all she's tired <O/>\n<$D> <O/> Opela tell us something\n<$B> I think what maybe <name/> was implying and maybe what I should hold as my own personal views is this that

turn out too well they start complaining nobody forces those women to stand back there are they forced to \n<$B> no they're not all but the complaint was not for those who stand back it wasn't for that women in front of a car\n<$A> \n<$B> but they're not complaining for her They're complaining for that woman who never stood in front of the car but who will later be seen as a possession because

{'text': "<$A> it's love founded in struggle that whereby he's writing the poem is I wanted to is somebody who is far away further removed from whereby he's addressing and uh as we're talking about what it have it has happened take the people in Africa during the age of uh and struggle against uh colonialism most people who are <O/> uh their families their relationships in the camp of <O/> So these days writing from a faraway place we can't tell a place where but there is any location to show that uh he is further removed from where his addressee and that wherever his addressee will be they will be have a special relationship holding together\n<$B> there is also an auditory to ask question about you know his idea to be a contract worker <O/> get me know for instance that uh the contract workers who are really are reallyRRR workers who are in they were all they were not uh were notRRR educated and these people were supposed to work really Their labour was contracted you know by the South African government so is like uh <O/> of it all during that period and through that period and at least they were working they were supposed you know they were supposed to work very hard and apart from that you know they were supposed to the money was taken away by the South African government and the South African government in turn will suppose were supposed pay now pay the Portuguese government and the Portuguese government again in turn you know contract uh deduct whatever it considered as tax <O/> yeah <O/> drawing from the pay yeah from the pay of this\n<$A> I tell what it means they give the family to the <O/>\n<$B> yeah\n<$A> this was a regular manner\n<$B> okay so is like uh this contract worker was isolated as he put it but we know really that uh the contract workers were really working in South Africa so is like this is a letter now I think as you rightly put it addressing to one of his lovers\n<$A> <slang/>'coz I'm imagining somebody's old factory they had to go home if at all they go home and he's addressing somebody who he's really loving one he loves but he's away from her\n<$B> yeah so how can we identify the okay the generally the pain of this particular point I wanted you I wanted to address you to this particular line on the a nameless pain which pursues me a nameless pain which is this pain he is talking about\n<$A> of this pain which the <O/> want I feel a nameless pain which pursues me is it the pain of separation\n<$B> yeah now that we have identified from what that what we have said we have already identified that uh that is isolation it is lack of education and the basic emotion here is love is it So perhaps we can say that uh that reference to a nameless pain has to do with uh that aloneness that this gentleman must be feeling wherever he is\n<$A> due to their separation\n<$B> I don't know that is maybe but you can make additions\n<$A> I guess the pain he  feels hurt there is this person he loves very much but apparently is far for him and the use of the word pain it is not something that maybe he caused to happen it's not his fault that they are separated could be it is the system that was wanted to  separate them that have to force people to get out of their homes go and work for long days or months without having to see their families so that pain of separation from especially somebody who loves\n<$B> yeah let me just to make uh an addition it could also refer to the anguish that he feels within himself the anguish of uh what  has happened the dream of life of him and his likes it becomes a constant stigma in terms that to feel that you just must be a contract worker that is your destiny and that kind of feeling\n<$A> and also that it has to relegating to that kind of life you know where how you <O/> that together you have to communicate this way you can never stay together anymore\n<$B> and also this it is this destiny to hiding the nature of this contract not aiming at his memories not perhaps to something that is a bit as he put it is a it is some anguish which is in the heart but apart from this that I think it is also something which is again uh so immense it is not just one there is other pains\n<$C> yes I don't know\n<$B> it it's a pain not as we know it in the ordinary sense this is a pain that is unique\n<$A> is it why it is taken it is nameless this term nameless why has it been\n<$B> yeah or <O/> express\n<$C> there is something which I really <O/> if he says it pursues me which means it is constant in his life it is something that follows him night and day it is something that is in him will come really <O/> so it is uh I would say it is like uh a stigma and then again this is your point as you say you know he can't write and really the idea of this poem is that this guy wants to write a letter to whoever he loves but he can't write so what is your modification as in the context of this point Does he complain that he doesn't have education as a tool to help him communicate his emotions his feelings to the other person or does he look at it with uh with uh in a satirical manner as to say just that uh maybe perhaps he doesn't need it at all What is your view what is education is a very central issue during that particular time like in the camp of <O/>\n<$B> you're really\n<$C> there weren't some really complaints that he can't write and really wants to write Is it a complaint that he's putting across or is it just at it in a satirical manner Does it uh does he just want to bring up a humour Okay as in the last few stanzas you have to agree on a very critical issue here when not is this a uh the best agents of you know conveying this particular love as the major role you know the major role major roleRRR things in life like uh\n<$B> the wind\n<$C> the winds you know the cashew and the coffee trees even he talks about the  animals the hyenas and the buffalo so is like uh is like he's making uh some point about education here uh I wouldn't really say that uh uh he does not really need this education\n<$B> okay\n<$C> I think he's part of this pain he's talking about is uh as a result of you know lack of his education that perhaps now that he has been uh rejected now that he has not he has been denied this particular education he is not too happy very much happy about it and perhaps is now resorting to another means you know of conveying the same message perhaps even winds will do it better than you know the written message\n<$B> uh the nature of the finals of the final line I think it's very emphatic but I can't write to see that oh my hopelessness I can't write it I think it's very emphatic as to suggest that uh but the way for this guy there is not to have education he feels some form of adoration from what perhaps he would like to be or something like that\n<$C> now I also want to know really I wanted to bring attention to this particular line about the addressee in this line the addressee also can't read the addressee can't read I know we know that the addressee is right back in the home country that is in uh Angola okay So what is your view about you know the situation of the colonised\n<$B> no now it they still would say that\n<$C> I would say that uh in this a letter to from a contract worker so I think the trend was that uh these people were not supposed to get education because they were supposed to be contract workers if perhaps they got education they'll become more critical they will question the kind of thing within their lives They want to perhaps to have uh something better than just being mere contract workers The so in turn you were missing that comes from this pains that uh the destiny for the uneducated in the context of Portuguese uh colonies was uh to become a contract worker you didn't have to bring anything else what else and this man looks at that kind of thing that kind of stereotyping and is what fills him the lot of anguish above on just the fact that he cannot communicate his message of love to his lover in a letter it's also that kind of he feels that uh uh this lack of education <O/> him lot and his like I mean the people the other contract workers of the other countries around him\n<$B> and I wanted also to bring your attention to this okay to me it appears as if it is some paradox of some kind who is talking to the person in this case is lamenting that he cannot write yet at the end of the day he's written a poem What does it mean \n<$A> all he's saying really is his intention\n<$C> well you see this is a reflection a reflectionRRR of society this poem that is a reflection of society you know you cannot you can't just write what you are not but what you can observe isn't it\n<$B> yeah so he's whoever wrote this poem the <O/> was just uh a reflection on his society was this reflecting on that strains being in society the emotions that go through the minds of people how they feel about the systems\n<$C> so in other words you are saying that uh the person in this case is quite distanced from the poet\n<$B> yeah I would say because we know the poet is Antonio Jacinto\n<$C> yeah\n<$B> but now he's created he has created a person\n<$A> yeah this person \n<$C> yeah I\n<$B> so it is this I now who is not able to who is not able to write\n<$A> yeah \n<$B> he's just\n<$C> so it is now recollecting on experiences in the society\n<$B> yeah\n<$C> it's just like uh you would for example you look around and you see things happen in daily  surroundings some you really feel for them you feel is there something to suffering and you feel for him but at one time or another you identify his particular problem in the particular case you can't write a poem you're even just do it yourself you are sure one person would say <onom/>aye because you also feel that's the emotion that caused to <O/> that particular person\n<$B> and it's also this other issue I wanted to bring your attention to okay especially the second the last the second last stanza uh the sorrowful words of the letter <O/> you know that uh the words of this poem change from sorrowful\n<$C> they really look sorrowful in the strictest sense of the word what \n<$A> let's me tell you just there is a point here the <O/> pitying <*_>or sharp soul from song to song lament to lament would lead to pure and hot the ban the sorrowful words are very talented to read to me I don't know what is the person of the \n<$B> okay as have you supported the person is that acquaints some anguish but then he wants to write a love poem uh a love letter to the addressee who is way back who is now very far back home uh and now he in the first stanza he's talks about this nameless pain and now he is talking about you know the intimate secrects and in a letter of memories of you okay then he goes on to discuss the nature of this particular of the addressee her lips you know the hair the eyes you know the breast all this thing that caresses yet I was really wondering towards the end he is talking about the sorrowful words of the letter and you know that these words is he the poet is writing or the person is writing are not even sorrowful", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '158a6a43-deaf-4438-9902-13b87534d0cc', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.185175+00:00', 'english_score':

bachelors degree\n<$B> It is equivalent to a bachelors degree\n<$A> And so for somebody to obtain that one has to be very tough\n<$B> Uh I don't think these things are because if you compare it with what we are doing here \n<$A> They are better off\n<$B> Not better off They are easy\n<$A> They are easy\n<$C> \n<$B> Because you know there you are taught you know compare being in a college and

twenty per cent of what you require\n<$B> Yeah that means you have to research you know you go to the library but there\n<$A> Uh\n<$B> they really make sure that \n<$A> Uh\n<$B> they teach you\n<$A> In fact uh you have to get a lot of grasping\n<$B> And you know all these colleges are competing among themselves\n\n<$A> unlike the university you know in a university you are not competing with any

to the city\n<$B> But these colleges must be wherever you are.\n<$A> But you see now we come from rural area some of us So you can't just find these colleges there and \n<$B> Check okay\n<$C> Yeah\n<$A> I would have would haveRRR registered for it because instead of picking economics \n<$B> Oh you are doing economics\n<$A> No I'm no longer doing it I am doing political science and

\n<$A> Yeah\n<$B> So as I was saying I like university where you have to read on your own In such colleges they must make you pass <O/> who if they were to know where the exam will come from they will just teach you on how to pass it\n<$A> \n<$C> Uh\n<$B> because they are just competing among themselves\n<$C> This exam is set by the uh I mean is a national exam \n<$C> I think is a national exam\n<$B> No is a national exam\n<$A> Some thing then all the students must register for this course\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> Okay so is something recognised\n<$B> is recognised\n<$C> It is very much recognised In fact they have specific dates for this exam \n<$A> So now boy can you comment on this issue how religion came into the society \n<$C> Okay I have not attended much of the classes but yeah give your general view about it your layman's understanding of it \n<$C> How religion came\n<$A> Yeah you explain what Ottelo was trying to ask What is your conceptualisation of religion in the society Trace its origins How do you come that man need to come down and think about maybe having something supreme or something of that thing\n<$C> Uh I think this religion must have come in when man discovered he had problems\n<$A> \n<$C> and it was difficult to solve\n<$A> \n<$C> You know first of all you have problem\n<$A> \n<$C> And you don't know how to solve it Okay like from my own experience I only think of God when I have problem\n<$A> \n<$B> It is good to be honest \n<$A> It is good to be honest\n<$C> Yeah at times like I don't know there is a time I had a very pressing problem\n<$A> Uh\n<$C> And this time I promised God God if you assist me to solve this problem I will be saved \n<$A> Are you saved now\n<$C> I am not \n<$A> So your problem was solved\n<$C> The problem was solved\n<$A> So you cheated God now\n<$C> Yeah Yeah I cheated God \n<$B> If there is God\n<$C> Yeah if there is God \n<$A> Of course God is there\n<$C> Then I lied to him\n<$A> That is the thing at least we commonly know that God is there we can't uh achieve that \n<$B> Yeah\n<$C> Uh\n<$A> We know God exists How would you react to\n<$C> The fact that we can't prove that god exists means he is not there\n<$A> So we try to prove and we can't uh even convince this means is like we can't also if we don't have the material the linguistic material to explain or to express God's existence that means that God is not there God is still there I still believe that\n<$B> You believe or you can prove\n<$A> We can't prove because you see God is \n<$B> That kind of thing Believing I mean we need to believe you can't \n<$A> Uh\n<$C> So that you can understand \n<$B> Have you borrowed it from <name/> \n<$A> I can't borrow it from <name/> but I read some of his works\n<$B> Some time ago\n<$A> Uh so but now boy I have still one question\n<$C> Uh\n<$A> Now that you told me that when you have problems\n<$C> Uh\n<$A> you tend to maybe remember God or such things are your problems really getting solved now as a result of you taking them before God or how does the solution of the problems come about\n<$C> I think most of the problems have been solved \n<$A> By the power of gGd or by what power\n<$C> All circumstances that came uh \n<$B> Yeah you know all circumstance can come in but you tend to think that\n<$C> Uh What happen there is another day in fact I don't know what really happen because you have you just see a coincidence and you really don't know how it worked out Like assuming you are here\n<$A> \n<$C> two minutes ago\n<$A> \n<$C> then something tells you just walk from here go and stand there \n<$A> Uh\n<$C> Then no sooner have you walked away from there than say a bomb erupts from here \n<$A> uh\n<$C> Now how will you will youRRR explain that You know at least you 'll tend to think the power of God is working God is really with me\n<$A> Uh\n<$C> At least is God who told me to move away from here\n<$A> Uh\n<$C> because he knew something was going to happen\n<$A> Okay now let me ask you some question there\n<$C> Uh\n<$A> So you want to tell me that those who have been perishing as a result of the explosion of this bomb\n<$C> \n<$A> are not with God since you claimed you are with God and God has guided you to move from that point of disaster to a safer point so you want to tell me that those who perish there are not with God\n<$C> And this is where I find religion to be uh\n<$A> absurd\n<$C> absurd and maybe to claim that it is God that guided you \n<$A> \n<$C> also to be absurd\n<$A> \n<$C> because for one thing\n<$A> Uh\n<$C> God being the creator of all humankind\n<$A> \n<$C> why should he decide to take away boy from a particular place where a bomb is \n<$C> almost exploding \n<$A> \n<$C> and leave the others to be knocked down by the bomb and perish uh\n<$B> Yeah\n<$C> This is the question I have been asking all these people who these people whoRRR claim that they are  saved and they come to trying to save me also Or help me get saved I still don't understand Like there is a case Okay a certain relative of mine who died in a very \n<$A> \n<$C> what can I say I mean he suffered so much \n<$A> \n<$C> before finally getting finally dying\n<$A> Okay there was much \n<$C> Yeah much pain Now I am asking if at all God knew that this man\n<$A> \n<$C> is finally going to die because at least we are all aware that God knows what is going to happen to someone and everybody if anything\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> Just like they say\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> Now even if we all know it\n<$A> Yeah\n<$C> Now how comes he can let one to suffer so much\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> before finally taking away his life Why can't he just take away his life early enough so that he does not suffer and maybe some kind of you see These are some of the problems that religion cannot answer\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> when we start questioning we ask more questions than they can answer So is part of the problem anyway is part of the problem\n<$A> How do you constitution of it boy the whole idea \n<$C> Beautiful there is a claim that God has a plan for everybody\n<$A> \n<$C> Like you know like there are at times Christians could come to me and how we need to get saved\n<$A> \n<$C> So I use to ask them why is it that God is so I don't know which word to use <O/> he makes some people suffer while others enjoy\n<$A> Uh\n<$C> Yeah God is so discriminating\n<$A> Uh\n<$C> and

Manslaughter is better I think\n<$C> I think now he was convicted for around a year I'm not sure and you know \n<$C> He has already stayed in the prison for some time <O/> he was appealed for \n<$C> Yeah so you know the magistrate the judge was convinced that since he has already stayed in prison for some time\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> and he has now been convicted for a year\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> he should be released because at least he has already finished a year\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> So the girl was released \n<$A> He was acquitted\n<$C> Yeah the girl self and you know what she gives them problems she gives them testimonies because she still gives them problems now\n<$A> Uh\n<$C> She just can't decide to get saved \n<$C> <O/> a white man who is a missionary in my place\n<$A> Uh Would you allow me to release a <O/> from my own I will be coming just immediately\n<$C> Yeah so I was talking about this missionary in my place that he was telling me that he comes from Canada I just want to visit him in his place but he lives in Nairobi\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> so he told me told meRRR that you see in Canada people don't care about going to the church\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> because people they have basically everything for human existence that they need like a car almost everybody is having a car\n<$B> \n<$C> and there is just no much problems \n<$B> Uh\n<$C> and some people will find no reason of going to church\n<$B> Uh\n<$C>So I told him so <O/> people are materialistic in your place\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> He said Yeah kind of kind of people are materialistic but you see\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> Yeah somebody can have that concept of God and you can know that God is there\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> but to bother to go to church or why go to church there is no need\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> <O/> unless\n<$B> There are no problems\n<$C> Yeah unless one is in full service that is the time he is going to take himself now to the church for\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> such purposes \n<$B> Uh\n<$C> So I was trying to compare it with Africa so he said now in our case if you come to Africa so how do you find here\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> So he declined to comment\n<$B> \n<$C> Sometimes I don't know due to personal reasons or what he declined to comment the\n<$B> He is a foreigner isn't it \n<$C> Yeah he is a foreigner\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> But he was very good he was very social\n<$B> It could be could beRRR he was declining because he does not know much about Africa\n<$C> Yeah maybe because he was enquiring a lot of things from me\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> So\n<$B> And for that matter what was he implying Was he implying that in Canada uh people are not \n<$B> people are not all that religious\n<$C> Yeah\n<$B> And then if they are it is just an insignificant of them\n<$C> Yeah\n<$B> Okay\n<$C> Yeah they don't see it because people are comfortable\n<$B> I see\n<$C> So you bring a <O/> to them tell them that this is the new way\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> And they are already comfortable you see uh\n<$B> They don't bother \n<$C> So the impact is just insignificant \n<$C> So to a very big extent or to a large extent\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> What <O/> was saying that uh\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> You see when you have problem is the time people rush to church I think is a \n<$C> is appointment to <O/>\n<$B> Uh \n<$C> to hold water\n<$B> Uh \n<$C> Uh\n<$B> So you must be wondering why people must go to the church\n<$C> Yes that is the question I have been asking myself for a very long time\n<$B> \n<$C> and I have even come to conclusion on subjective basis \n<$B> Uh\n<$C> that I should not maybe consider myself as one of the people to go in the street because of any church I don't just love it\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> I have found that it is of no use \n<$B> Uh\n<$C> In fact it is expensive\n<$B> And is very expensive\n<$C> and in fact <O/> are commercialising it and most of the people are not even \n<$C> Yes\n<$B> This thing they call \n<$C> And with this money\n<$B> \n<$C> and out of this money\n<$B> \n<$C> the man can even buy some of the his house properties\n<$B> \n<$C> Uh and it is that money \n<$C> That is what she is going to <O/>\n<$B> Surely\n<$C> They don't misuse it\n<$B> Uh\n<$D> They are supposed to be not\n<$B> No for the wedding \n<$B> <O/> collect some money to be used during the wedding\n<$C>Yeah during the wedding\n<$B> But you know these are <O/> because of the wedding \n<$C> Uh\n<$B> then they find their houses and begin to\n<$C> Yeah and even \n<$C>And even develop a plot \n<$C>They can even develop a plot\n<$B> I mean they have got this fund for their wedding or something else\n<$C> Yeah\n<$B> so is not fair to the people\n<$D> Is not fair\n<$C> And it is very bad by the time we are waiting for a class in the mph\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> and so there is a lady a certain lady who brought her another card for us I was sitting next to Kabuwe\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> so Kabuwe abuwe told us that if it is for wedding I am not going to contribute\n<$B> Uh\n<$D> Which class was that government class\n<$C> We were waiting were waitingRRR here we were in a in second year\n<$D> Second year \n<$C> We were waiting for government class\n<$B> \n<$C> The lady was so much embarrassed\n<$D> Why\n<$C> Usually because she was expecting that at least we contribute and then if uh we don't have money there and then\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> then we can write something and later on give him give her the money\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> But by the time we just put her off \n<$B> And it was pre-wedding card\n<$C> Yeah pre-wedding card \n<$B> Things are commercialising these days\n<$D> Uh\n<$B> Too entrepreneur in nature\n<$C> Yeah\n<$D> So you decided not to \n<$C> Me I have come to a point whereby I don't think it is important to <O/> first the principle that the first principle that I have based on my rejection for wedding is that maybe people are taking it to be a kind of a show-off\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> Somebody wants to display how much\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> how much <O/> used in the wedding\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> And now you see it is like a competition such that\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> When you let's say for my case now if I don't have enough  funds to uh spend for the wedding\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> <O/> below that level \n<$D> And others take it for prestigious purposes you see\n<$C> Yeah others you see people have been \n<$D> That you are all Christians and you've been going to church together and now somebody you can even hear somebody I mean \n<$C> Uh\n<$D> carrying on some rumour that so and so <O/> this is the way he is that he cannot even hold a wedding he cannot and then they claim to be Christians you know is just to diminish others I mean relegate others\n<$B> Uh\n<$D> while you praise yourself you feel prestigious\n<$B> It has become a matter of competition\n<$D> Yeah and then \n<$D> They are distorting the meaning of the thing all together And this thing has discouraged many people from doing their weddings in churches because\n<$B> Uh \n<$D> So in my case I don't know that is still a question I put to in suspense \n<$D> Anyway I have not decided which way to follow \n<$B> Uh\n<$D> I can use the traditional way which is still fine \n<$B> Yeah\n<$C> Or you wed in \n<$D> Yeah these are all possibilities Maybe a time will come I will maybe get to I will <O/> it\n<$B> Uh\n<$D> Yeah about it\n<$A> So let's go back to this issue of religion boy\n<$B> Uh\n<$A> You know I do you people believe in the existence of uh spirit <O/> spirit\n<$B> <O/> spirit\n<$A> Uh that when someone dies there are so many <O/> spirits there \n<$A> Even yellow spirit boy\n<$B> <O/> spirit well I don't know \n<$C> <O/> being philosophical rather than being religious\n<$A> Yeah the two must go together because you see philosophy asks why this\n<$C> Uh and religion asks why this in philosophy\n<$A> Yeah\n<$C> in fact during medieval time the argument is that philosophy is a lot of religion\n<$A> Yeah\n<$C> And religious people argue that is now No I mean is the philosophy people are arguing that \n<$C> that religion comprises of philosophy \n<$A> That is the conflict between religion and philosophy\n<$C> Yeah\n<$A> Yeah\n<$C> But I don't see anything wrong with it We can just discuss it for the sake of being I mean rationally and looking at things critically\n<$A> Uh\n<$C> without even basing our arguments on okay without even referring to those who are only religious people or those who are only philosophers\n<$A> Yeah that is general now do you think this thing called soul does it exist Do we have Does human being have a soul\n<$C> Now what do you mean by a soul\n<$A> Is like in religion I have heard many people say that you see when you die your soul goes somewhere\n<$C> Uh\n<$A> or something for that <O/>\n<$C> Uh\n<$A> So I have tended to doubt there is one court house\n<$C> Uh\n<$A> So that thing they call that I don't know \n<$C> In fact in Plato Platonic sense\n<$A> Plato that one will be different because I think they were pretty so\n<$C> Uh\n<$A> to <O/>\n<$C> to psyche\n<$A> Yeah I think so\n<$C> \n<$A> In the mind\n<$C> Yeah in the mind\n<$A> That is why we think that you see when you\n<$C> Uh\n<$A> the soul goes to the world of the ideal world of forms\n<$C> \n<$A> so that it goes back again into and  inhabits another body\n<$C> \n<$A> in the process of <O/> or so\n<$C> Yeah\n<$A> the Platonic kind of transfiguration or so\n<$C> Uh\n<$A> So that one I think you don't believe in I don't know but I think it was like <O/>\n<$C> If we don't divorce philosophy do you think that can be equivalent of God you mean they mean the same thing\n<$A> the ghost\n<$C> I think a ghost has usually been taken in the sense that it means something that is Okay those spirits that are somehow evil\n<$A> Uh\n<$C> and they are not out for the main good of those who are still living now for a soul It is taken to be something that is something holy and when someone dies it will be going to either to hell or going somewhere where we don't know waiting for the judgement according to religion\n<$A> So do you think a soul can be associated with something good or a ghost is\n<$C> That is what I tend to think but I stand to be corrected I don't know\n<$B> Yes of course\n<$A> Me I don't think so because now if we associate a ghost to something negative that is what you imply\n<$C> Yeah\n<$B> Uh\n<$A> Therefore it means that saying Holy Ghost if they say that God is Holy Ghost in Christianity\n<$C> \n<$A> So what does then \n<$A> You see it is contradictory now \n<$A> Holy and ghost and then you say that ghost is something I mean is a spirit that is bad that causes evil on peoples\n<$C> \n<$A> that brings things that are negative\n<$C> Okay Yeah something of that nature how do you say about to such an extent I don't think I think I speak uh\n<$B> Uh\n<$C> So it can still be treated to a ghost\n<$A> A ghost uh\n<$B> Yeah then if at all a ghost then I think they exist because I have heard of stories where people say they saw so and so that died Have you heard of such a story\n<$A> Yeah I have heard of such stories but I am still yet to understand how really it is You see you can't understand some of these things and you don't know how they come about \n<$B> Uh\n<$A> How can somebody say that somebody died a long time ago and now she saw the ghost of the same person also last night\n<$B> Uh\n<$A> You wonder what is really happening for that matter I think we can in fact\n<$C> So we have a ghost that is what we conclude\n<$A> A ghost and a spirit \n<$C> Uh\n<$A> it is just the same thing These are synonymous terms\n<$C> Yeah\n<$A> so that we can have an evil spirit or an evil ghost and a good spirit you see\n<$B> Or good ghost\n<$A> Yeah maybe we could have such things", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM',

{'text': "<$A> What I'm saying is you said I should and I say I'm going to get married or I intend to later on but right now I think it just depends if the right person comes along Now this thing of being swept off your feet\n<$B> Now let me suggest specify a certain point from here I get married at the twentieth of July after I leave campus\n<$A> No but what's your right age to get married There is never a right day The right is I think is more the right time than the right age How do you know you're ready for a marriage <O/> uh the day my daughter was ready to marry if not you must be quite unfortunate \n<$C> it's true that's why I think marriage really it has to wait\n<$B> Waiting with all the frog's faith your beauty create the prince\n<$A> Why it has <O/> it has to be \n<$B> Well it happens to most of the people is that you know you can only take a case study of yourself\n<$C> Now let's take a case whereby maybe your background at home you see marriages and you see directly what is happening in marriages You see them breaking up going towards divorce and all that Why should I look forward to marriage after I've seen all that\n<$B> Well I believe here the situation is different\n<$A> Yeah \n<$C> circumstance\n<B> I also think that you can take the opponents of the work this institution work Look make a difference to be one it means \n<$C> To prove your points there are also some marriages which are very good still You know people live happily they need together understand each other I think the main thing here is just understanding\n<$A> and get paid\n<$B> my at least in I don't say <O/> when my brideprice enough\n<$A> with any marriage\n<$C> Yeah and I'm not going without that price being big\n<$B> I think is this the prevailing situation You know things are changing for the better or for the worse or whatever so brideprice actually is uh what individualistic\n<$A> culturally I think\n<$B> so we should do our road\n<$C> Well let's say your parents you might want to do it but your parents might not See after educating you all these years they may want to get something after the whole process \n<$?> But no right right now divisions are basic need\n<$C> It is yes it's a basic need but the sacrifices your parents had you got it\n<$B> More than this my husband is more educated than I am you have to be <O/> you know\n<$C> He still has to pay for that kind of respective work when you are  taken\n<$A> I don't I just find <O/> it drags marriages and all like if I go without him being anything it's like have eloped and I wouldn't want to have that reputation that I eloped\n<$B> I think uh Christianity authorists have off to claim peace My parents never paid that kind of brideprice in the fifties can you believe \n<$C> Yeah my mum would have paid for brideprice I think it was not the boys They are trying to set an example in a society where everyone else is doing this but still today when I meet my cousin <O/> my mum would have paid for your brideprice So if anything happens its opponents give in if that situation arises at you you have to pay \n<$A> But I okay thanks that setting communities whereby if like your mother has given that brideprice now when she dies there arises a problem your mother's people will come and claim that she is still their daughter <slang/>'coz they don't recognise your father\n<$?> Yeah for us is a provision provided if yeah to get that lady instead where you have to pay an initial price of three goats Once you have three goats just three goats as it were three goats in faith three goats nothing can separate you even if they go to the courts \n<$?> I see your father has to pay three goats\n<$?> Three goats \n<$?> to your mother's people\n<$A> I believe three goats yeah First when you're going to meet them you take beer and take four goats one the people eat and the other three are kept\n<$B> Okay so that one has already cleared that\n<$C> That's cleared that Now let's setting the stage for any other things that you would want to give your \n<$B> Is the first thing your father goes to your mother's home\n<$A> No\n<$B> Is it like an introduction Is it like to propose yourself a proposal like for the marriage or your mother is already gone\n<$C> Okay first the two people might have met before the parents no long time it was used to be parents sometimes arranged from both sides But now in these days they meet by themselves and that's okay so Well much later they can do the tradition if they want to get married First we shall go through the custom the custom of really <O_><O/> your parents have the goat <O_><O/> there's a goat in your hand that you want to dig <O_><O/> So now it's up to your parents to say yes only to say yes when they have the goat they go and bring the first goat and beer they did bring it it's called the beer step into the home\n<$A> Yeah saying step in the home that beer both parents take First the lady takes the mother the bride's mother takes gifts to the bride's father After they take gifts their negotiations start if the <O/> go ahead means when they can go back and bring the goats At this stage the parents can still say no The parents now will have now they might have goat But the ops they obviously leave the goats in their ropes \n<$B> that's we believe we're saying all the first time we never get married again\n<$C> So that they have to just agree \n<$A> they have to agree\n<$B> for every proposal what comes\n<$C> for every proposal that comes I mean if a man is interested in you\n<$B> okay\n<$A> what is holding you back that's the way they used to live\n<$C> it's like the girl has no choice\n<$B> yeah that's right It's sort of like the girl has no say If the man is interested then she just has to go\n<$A> she has to go yeah\n<$B> whether she likes it or not\n<$C> whether she like it or not\n<$B> that's forced\n<$C> yeah\n<$A> to get married\n<$?> they did initial three goats that are still alive They're supposed to be still alive They're not supposed to be killed It's only the one that's slaughtered supposed to be three  goats\n<$A> okay well at least it's shows promise you promise to take care of something\n<$?> yeah\n<$B> which will be accepted  But this really it's like\n<$C> so even in the contemporary society another case right now examined interesting and we read out here obvious that will be the arranged marriages We read out here first he has to bring his four goats\n<$A> okay nowadays you get these people where which would say come and stay whereby you move into your boyfriend's house and you stay You have your first kid second kid before he even meets your parents Now then one great day he just  meets someone else and he went dresses up from your house which you live in and then he goes to attend the wedding You only get to hear that your husband got married your boyfriend got married Now in this case he will leave you You don't have a basis on which to say that you are married but according to everyone of the neighbours you are married <slang/>'coz you used to live together\n<$?> that comes still estate agencies yeah comes state nothing you need\n<$B> now I'd rather say not go through that\n<$C> at this stage they may think brideprice is not \n<$?> it's important\n<$?> that's why I'm saying\n<$?> it's a binding\n<$?> it has to has toRRR be there There is no other way we can do We just walk up to be parents\n<$A> no but on the other hand is the legal procedure that means you can either go to the DC and you declare you're married At least something to show Know that one day you'll just walk out and that is all\n<$B> I don't know why I don't know why but have this feeling that this is the this is theRRR register place It's not so bad but compared to the custom you can just wake up and say no forget it we are not into each other we're just bad But you see now before you get to separate and you've gone through the other custom of the brideprice the traditional manner then in a state of trying to reconciliate \n<$C> as in the it is a provision for that by the entrance\n<$B> yeah you have to come if you decide to divorce will take a long process First you go to your mother-in-law You tell her why you want you don't want this man anymore in your life If she can't settle the thing you have come to the state you might just go back to your place to your mother's place if you go now the <O/> would come to your parents' home From then on you can sort things out and problems but and you can't go back  \n<$A> now like let's say there are some cases whereby men take brideprice to be like binding and so they can beat you any time they're drunk they can send you home any time you \n<$B> no on that basis I'd rather not have brideprice\n<$C> surely now it's become a punishing bargain because you never feel good\n<$A> <slang/>'coz every time you do something they want to be paid brideprice or to get some proof when you didn't go and cut the tails from the goats like if you punishing him because of the brideprice you paid then reduce them So you go home and cut the tail from the goats so it becomes less for a cow so that I'm worth what I am \n<$B> is it a sort of idiom \n<$A> it's an idiom\n<$C> it's an idiom\n<$B> it's an idiom yeah you go and cut the goat\n<$C> cut the tails\n<$C> cut the tails so it is the worth that will count\n<$B> my worth I'm worth what I am\n<$A> okay\n<$C> you do have to count that you bought him We are equal\n<$B> but nowadays people don't pay with goats You go with money and other things\n<$C> it's commercialised\n<$A> it's commercialised It's a business\n<$B> yeah sure\n<$C> the more daughters you have it is the rich person Yeah in fact most  Africans now the men nowadays they'd rather have daughters than boys as opposed long time when you get a daughter you go and throw it in the bush you don't want to reduce your <O/> In my country giving back two daughters only is supposed to give back two sons also\n<$A> sounds very expensive\n<$C> land you have to give them land\n<$B> you have to provide for that brideprice\n<$C> yeah you have to pay the brideprice In fact your father pays for you the brideprice\n<$A> and let the other party I understand that is the lady who pays\n<$B> the lady pays for the man and it's the lady who's the called head of the house\n<$C> the head of the house \n<$A> why not no that you think to want to dominate\n<$B> no it's however much I'll want to dominate I still want to see the man as the man not as the one I bought\n<$C> still yeah like you can go anytime according to how you want it you can leave until you go plus the brideprice I don't want this is just the worst state he doesn't want you he doesn't want his bride rice back so you know that really is no way is no doubt about it he does not want you back\n<$B> he does not write to you a word anymore\n<$C> yeah or he brings another a second wife and then he says say I paid the brideprice at your home what is wrong with me paying brideprice at another home \n<$A> he gets all has all the money They can marry as many wives as they can depending on how much money you have Provided you can pay bride price it is okay You can even marry ten in the age of the grandchildren it's okay \n<$C> in fact the worst thing of the old man wanting to marry the young You know you marry someone that is younger than your own children much younger\n<$B> much much younger\n<$A> just because you know you have the women have no say in this you know", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL',

delighted that this occasion is attended by the Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organisation Doctor Bokscher who will also address this workshop Please you are most welcome to Tanzania On behalf of the government and the people of the Republic of Tanzania I wish to welcome our distinguished guests from outside Tanzania to Tanzania and particularly to the city of Dar es Salaam Mr Chairman this workshop is on copyright and neighbouring rights From your programme it is evident that you will will be covering a wide range of coverage related to copyright and neighbouring rights I'm certain this an area of immense importance to the literal and artistic work in developing countries and especially to our country Tanzania Mr Chairman distinguished guest I do not profess to be an expert  on intellectual property matters but I am aware of the fact that literal and artistic works originating in developing countries particularly Africa have been taped by nationals and institutions in the developed countries without even acknowledging their original source let alone paying alone payingRRR or in other cases adequately paying for such rights This is not only exploitation but outright cheating for profit It denies the actual owner of the the right rights getting a fair return and rightful recognition for their contribution to the pleasure of such works given to mankind Mr Chairman we must heed the outcry of our literal and artistic creators now The <O/> in the recognition and the participation in the various copyright conventions and treaties ought to be checked now Let this workshop be the first step in that direction Distinguished participants the mere fact that we are not members of some of the treaties administered by the World Intellectual Property Organisation should not be construed to mean that we are against them We are aware of the disadvantages of not being members and would like to become conversant with all the technicalities as we take the necessary steps towards joining or rather acceding to such treaties This workshop has thus come at an opportune moment Mr Chairman The expertise kindly provided by the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the wide representation offered by participants should enable this workshop to come up with recommendations that can help the government of the United Republic of Tanzania to review the copyright role and approach the treaties relating to intellectual property with greater clarity At this juncture I wish to commend the steps already taken by the National Arts Council the steps taken by the cultural sector to review the copyright act of nineteen sixty-six both of which have come up with proposals for updating the act and suggesting and suggestions for proper administering copyright matters in this country Let me repeat again the suggestions from this uh workshop would definitely be very much welcomed by the government of the United Republic of Tanzania In addition Mr Chairman this workshop should help publicise the rights of the inventors literal and artistic creators on the one hand and sensitise public copyright and neighbouring rights on the other

{'text': "Mr Chairman Distinguished Party and Government Leaders Mr Vice Chancellor Members of the Academic Staff and Students Honourable Guests Distinguished Alumnae of the University of Dar es Salaam Distinguished participants Ladies and Gentlemen I would like first of all to express my sincere thanks to the executive committee of the convocation of the University of Dar es Salaam for inviting me to open this *honorative> seminar I would also like to extend a hearty welcome to those of you from the donor community and those who have come from the regions to take part in this seminar The fact that this seminar has attracted participants from the donors and from outside Dar es Salaam is a measure of the degree of concern solidarity and interest in solving the serious social service delivery problems facing our country On behalf of the Government of Tanzania I thank you for your great concern Let me single out the Vice-Chancellor the organising committee and the sponsors the Nordic countries for making this seminar possible Let me take this opportunity to congratulate this university on this happy occasion of its twentieth anniversary Twenty years is not a very short period of time especially for such an important institution of higher learning in a young nation like ours which is in the process of implementing important development goals This university has an important role to play in the implementation of those development goals The government acknowledges and highly appreciates the invaluable contribution which this university has made to the development of our country during these twenty years of existence We especially appreciate its contribution to the fulfilment our nation's commitment to achieve self-sufficiency in high level manpower needs Since its establishment the University has produced a large number of lawyers teachers economists sociologists political scientists doctors and engineers About fifteen thousand experts have graduated from this University That has helped to increase the level of localisation of middle and high level manpower from twenty-six per cent to ninety-nine per cent between independence and nineteen eighty Today the majority of people holding positions of great responsibility in this country are graduates from this university What makes this makes thisRRR seminar truly historic is that it has brought together some of those people who owe a great deal to this university in terms of their educational attainments I'm pleased to see you here and thank you for your contribution to the development of our country The university itself as an institution has made and continues to make a valuable contribution to the development of our country through its research work workshops seminars and thought-provoking academic papers The holding of this seminar is part of the commemoration of its twentieth anniversary is yet another proof of the university's continued efforts to make a positive contribution to our national efforts to improve the well-being of our people The theme of this seminar Crisis of Social Services Delivery in Tanzania and Strategies for More Sustainable System in the nineteen nineties is both timely and relevant This theme is relevant because the provision of essential social services to the people has been the consistent commitment of the government of Tanzania since nineteen sixties In implementing that policy the government has invested substantial resources in the field of education health housing water supply and sanitation That was done with the valuable support and assistance of friendly countries some of which are represented at this seminar We thank them all for their assistance The results achieved are spectacular In the first two decades of our nation's history we managed to attain provision levels which received world-wide recognition In the field of education a massive universal primary education programme and adult education managed to raise our average literacy level from a low ten per cent in nineteen sixty-one to the present enviable level of ninety per cent The number of enrolment in primary schools as a percentage of the school age has increased from twenty per cent to ninety-three per cent The spectacular expansion of this university is a good example of the government's commitment to promote higher education in our country The expansion has been in both the number of enrolment and in the number of faculties The University started with five faculties and one institute Today it has seven faculties and five institutes In the field of health and nutrition an extensive facility network based on the cost on the least cost preventive approach was set up A health system based on village workers dispensaries rural health centres district regional and referral hospitals was established The number of rural health centres rose from twenty-two to two hundred and sixty Dispensaries increased from eight hundred and seventy-five to four thousand six hundred and seventy-six and hospitals from one hundred and nineteen to one hundred and forty-nine That system greatly improved the access of all Tanzanians including those in the rural areas to modern health services The population served by one physician improved by twenty-two per cent and dropped from two twenty-four thousand seven hundred to nineteen thousand two hundred and eighty The population served by one nurse improved remarkably and dropped fivefold from eleven thousand eight hundred ninety to a mere two thousand one hundred and and eighty-four Generally life expectancy at birth improved from thirty-five to fifty years Infant mortality rate was reduced from about one hundred and ninety about to about one thirty-seven per one thousand live births As for water sector the objective was to to provide clean water to all the population in a thirty year programme spanning between nineteen seventy-one and two thousand and two It was hoped that by nineteen eighty seventy five per cent of the rural population would be served with clean water Although this target was not reached by nineteen eighty eighty per cent of the urban population and forty-five per cent of the rural population had access to modern water services Mr Chairman in brief the achievements made in the development of those vital social services are remarkable Unfortunately the severe economic crisis which our country has been experiencing over the last decade has greatly eroded our ability to maintain them and have therefore sharply deteriorated The manifestation of that deterioration are not hard to find The poor state of our physical infrastructure especially road and railways is a constant reminder of the uh unfavourable economic situation prevailing in our country The networks of health services now perform poorly because of the lack of medicines and equipment Most water projects no longer function for lack of spare parts Equally affected by the economic crisis are our schools and universities which are faced with an acute shortage of teaching aids and books As part of the Tanzanian community the University of Dar es Salaam has not been spared from that effect of the current economic crisis That could be seen from the delapidated buildings and deterioration of essential services to the university community I'm pleased to note that work to rehabilitate those buildings is going on well Mr Chairman the persistent economic decline compelled the government to take difficult economic adjustments and recovery measures with the hope of reversing the negative trend I know that members of this audience are well versed with the measures taken Some of you have even conducted an assessment of the success of those measures So I will not waste your time by repeating them However I would like to point out that implementation of those measures has produced positive signs for economic recovery Implementation of the first phase of the economic recovery programme ERP has especially helped to improve both agricultural and industrial production That has greatly reduced widespread shortages of essential commodities The spectacular increase in agricultural production has enabled our country to achieve food self-sufficiency and increase the volume of export commodities Industrial production has also increased by five per cent As a result of the increase in agricultural and industrial production our gross domestic product has registered for the first time since nineteen seventy-eight an average of annual growth rate of four point one per cent well above the two per cent rate of population growth It is obvious from the foregoing that during the first phase of the ERP greater emphasis was placed on the improvement of production That was done in order to avert the danger of widespread hunger and to reduce the shortage of industrial goods In view of the limited resources at our disposal it was not possible to allocate adequate resources for the rehabilitation and improvement of social services at the same time As a result people continued to experience hardships That unfavourable situation compelled the government to adopt the priority of social action programme as a second phase of the ERP While in the first phase emphasis was put on improving production in the second phase emphasis is put on the rehabilitation and improvement of the greatly deteriorated social services In short the priority social action programme is intended to achieve the following objectives One to make institutional management and reforms which can improve the delivery of social services by creating an <O/> environment for improved efficiency accountability and mobilisation of community support and hence sustainability Two to restore an adequate supply of and effective demand for basic instructional materials in schools and to improve the learning environment by rehabilitating the delapidated buildings including those of this campus Three to restore an adequate supply of essential drugs and health care equipment in order to safeguard standards of provision of universal basic health services Four to rehabilitate the existing water facilities in order to provide improved access to safe water Five to improve the the the distribution of food from surplus areas to deficit areas so as to reduce the wide marketing regions margins between producer and consumer prices for staple foodstuffs Six to accelerate the creation of employment and income-generating activities in small-scale manufacturing and services Seven to support community-based public work schemes to create employment opportunities for low income people and improve their access to food and other essential goods and services with preference being given to women Eight to provide nutritional safety nets if necessary for families who are unable to earn enough to buy on adequate an adequate amount of food Mr Chairman the government recognises that implementation of this phase as was the case for the first phase requires a massive injection of resources Unfortunately the country's revenue uh generating capacity especially foreign exchange has not improved sufficiently enough to enable the government to allocate adequate resources to the social sector Our ability to earn sufficient uh foreign exchange continues to be affected by the persistent decline in world prices of our major export commodities and sharp increases in the prices of essential imports including those required to improve social services It is therefore a matter of great satisfaction that the friendly countries and international  organisations which gave us valuable uh assistance during the implementation of the first phase have also agreed to continue to help us with the implementation of the second phase For that reason I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of the government and people of Tanzania and on my own behalf to express our deep gratitude to those countries and  organisations for their valuable assistance I would like to stress however that as much as we do appreciate the available assistance from our friends the rehabilitation the rehabilitation improvement and maintenance of our social services remain the primary responsibility of the Tanzanians themselves each and everyone of us A more sustainable strategy for social service delivery must therefore be based on the active mobilisation and utilisation of our local resources and the intensification of our own efforts in compliance with our policy of socialism and self-reliance It is for that reason that the government continues to put great emphasis on communities' own responsibility for their basic social services through self-help schemes Mr Chairman the priority action programme is now in its second year of implementation Those of you gathered here may wish to conduct a critical review of the progress so far made in the implementation of the programme Such a review would indeed be appropriate because this seminar has fortunately attracted participants from the the donor community the regions academicians participants practitioners and high level public officials who are well versed with the crisis in our social services sector I feel confident that your review will help to identify those bottlenecks which hinder progress and recommend implementable measures which would help accelerate progress towards better services to our people I wish to ensure you that the government will give serious consideration to all your recommendations I therefore wish you fruitful deliberations and declare the second seminar of the Convocation of the University of Dar es Salaam officially opened Thank you for your attention",

{'text': "So uh yeah so I'm going to to try to give an analysis on the future of cooperatives with the development of <O/> agriculture in Tanzania uh My presentation will be divided into three parts The first I always try to expose the problem itself relating to the future of uh peasant cooperatives The second will be trying to show historical perspective of the position and the role of peasant cooperatives and then the third will be just a conclusion as to what I think will be the future in terms of position and role of peasant cooperatives So beginning with the first part uh one aspect which is quite obvious to those who have come across the history of peasant cooperatives or development of cooperatives in Tanzania is that from the nineteen fifties uh during the period of British colonialism uh peasant cooperatives assumed at least began to assume a monopoly a monopolistic role in the marketing of peasant crops and particularly uh the export crops uh Before that of course uh the people who were going into the marketing of peasant crops were private traders uh the so-called middleman traders who used to purchase peasant crops uh and sell them to the big uh export companies and that was the structure from the period of German colonialism to the first phase of British colonialism but in the nineteen fifties the cooperatives began to take over particularly in the area of export crops the so-called cash crops that is coffee tea cotton pyrethrum tobacco cashnuts So that's where they began to assume the monopoly Now this has continued this monopolistic tendency has continued uh up to the nineteen nineteen eighties so with the structural adjustment programme liberalisation in the privatisation programmes which we have been discussing here since yesterday So changes have begun to take place and these changes include uh now that private people again uh whereby the cooperatives in from the nineteen-fifties took over uh from the private traders Now they come in They come in again to play the same role they used to play in the past uh the marketing of peasant crops uh which means that uh from the mid-eighties uh up to now we have this development whereby uh private traders side by side with cooperatives uh are competing But there is a need to qualify the extent of that competition the extent to which that competition has reached up to this stage uh It is still at its lower level of development in the sense that much of the export crops traditional export crops have developed a system which is such that uh it's not easy for the private traders just to get in uh certain infrastructure structures If you have tobacco uh the cooperatives or the marketing boards own uh the processing plants so a private trader to take over the marketing of tobacco will not be that much easy Then there are <O/> the beginning of cotton uh and and other crops so the level the extent to which uh the private people are entering into the competition very much depends on the nature of the crop uh on the circumstance of a particular area This one is as such most of them the competition has much more developed in terms of fruit crops rather than in terms of uh traditional export crops Although even in that area still there are struggles uh For instance just by last year uh the regional governments of <name/> and <name/> uh decided to allow private traders to enter into the marketing of cashnuts which up to now are still under the monopoly of cooperatives the <name/> Cooperative Union and the <name/> Cooperative Union who sell to the uh regional cashnut uh product uh marketing board so that possibly this year the nineteen ninety-three ninety-four year uh the private traders are expected to be allowed to enter into that competition and in <name/> for instance the private traders have managed to take over completely the marketing of of cacao Now cacao is a new crop there so it's not yet developed into a larger scale so it has been easy for the private traders Mohammed and Enterprise Limited has taken over completely from the <name/> and <name/> marketing union So <name/> and <name/> marketing union are remaining for the marketing of rice and uh uh coffee and uh cacao has been taken over by a private firm So uh this <O/> just some sure examples to show the way the process is going but then in the area food although also there are some are someRRR problems uh For instance in the four so-called four big <O/> regions of <name/> Mbeya Rukwa and Iringa uh much of the maize for instance which is sold to Dar es Salaam is bought by private traders there but part of it is still through cooperatives who sell to the National Union Cooperation you see So you you still have in the fruit crop area uh this competition in developing Now the uh actual problem is is that uh uh first on the part of the cooperatives  Historically the cooperatives were particular cooperative unions were abolished nineteen seventy-six and then the uh crop authorities took over the position of crop uh uh cooperative unions so that it was the crop authorities which were now buying crops from primary cooperative societies in the villages which were now part of <O/> the development <O/> So the effect of that abolition in nineteen seventy-six and then re-establishment of the cooperative unions in nineteen eighty-two uh uh after the act of nineteen eighty-two resulted  in a situation whereby the cooperative unions began anew on a very weak capital base because when they were abolished they were abolished that by the order of the government and then all their uh property financial uh movable the movable property was handed over to crop authorities So when they were re-established maybe they could get again the immovable property such as buildings uh but the movable and the financial capital uh was no longer there and therefore they had to start at a very weak position in terms of capital base to be able to to market peasant crops So the result of that they had to depend now borrowing from the National Bank of Commerce and the uh Cooperative Rural Development Bank in order to get financed to be able to purchase uh crops from the peasants So this tendency developed to the extent that uh because of the high rate of interest which they had to pay and also coupled with the corruption which developed within the cooperative unions themselves so the uh there was a rapid rise of debts to the extent that by nineteen eighty-nine about eighty-fifty uh uh a survey of only seven cooperative unions amounted to a debt of fifteen billion shillings uh The cooperative unions could not pay and therefore the banks began to be strict the cooperative unions so they had now to buy crops on credit so you go to the peasants uh uh uh in fact by last year the their cooperative unions were negotiating very seriously to convince the peasants uh to sell their crops uh to the cooperative union on credit and you heard then their coffee is sold on the world market When the money comes then they can pay the peasants And this has created a lot of problems in terms of relationship between the peasants and the cooperatives So this is uh one problem on the side of the cooperatives And then on the side of the private traders uh a rough survey indicates that only very few traders with strong capital base uh such as Mohammed and Enterprise and others but the majority are just petty traders who have very weak capital base So it is feasible when you go along the many roads to collect the maize to collect I don't know what uh and then uh sell it to the areas uh where they are demanded Now the problem is that uh these traders have not been able to satisfy uh the marketing needs of the crops For one because of the transport infrastructure problem If they go uh deeper into the villages where you have got problems of transport that means uh transport expense will be very high and therefore they only choose areas where you have got easy access of transport and therefore they can only uh purchase uh crops from one part of the peasants but the majority of the peasants have no access to these traders So this is uh one problem Given the weak capital base they can't buy large quantities So there have been cases where the cooperatives because of this also the cooperatives having financial problems they could not purchase crops from the peasants such as maize and because again the private traders have the weak capital base most of them they could not satisfy uh uh the supply of crops from the peasants So you have a crisis situation and uh there are and and up to now there is no clear is no clearRRR government policy or guidance to regulate this type of competition So this is uh one of the aspects of the problem But the other uh is that also connected with the private traders is the fact that the private traders are only interested in the crops while cooperatives had two roles purchasing crops from the peasants marketing them and then ensuring that the peasants get uh some necassary inputs such as fertilizer uh and other uh necessary inputs But uh private traders have no interest  in that and therefore their interest is just to buy the crops So where cooperatives withdraw the peasants have got a problem of getting inputs and the example I've told you about the cacao is facing that problem so that the Mohammed Enterprise Limited uh is only interested in the buying of the crop and exporting it rather than helping the peasants also to get seedlings and other necessary items So anyway in short I wanted just the first part to expose this the nature uh of the problem itself So coming to the second part is that cooperatives and this I will be just brief the history of cooperatives peasant cooperatives in Tanzania begins uh from the nineteen nineteen-twenties and it begins through the initiative there of the farmers themselves the peasants particularly the peasants who were involved in the production of export crops and this is partly as a struggle against the middlemen traders The peasants perceived that the middlemen traders were responsible for giving them very low uh prices for their crops and therefore they were exploiting them so consequently uh peasants began to organise themselves so that they could take over the marketing of their crops So peasant associations began to be formed so that by nineteen twenty-four you had the uh uh Bukoba Bahara Union nineteen twenty-five you had the Kilimanjaro Native Planters Association uh later on you had the <name/> Association Iringa you had the Meru Growers Association uh and uh in Mwanza you had also Cotton Growers Association These were organised by the peasants themselves independent of the government So that was the beginning So this was the first stage in the development of cooperatives So when the British colonial government saw that development uh it found that it was not easy uh to abolish this uh mushrooming of peasant associations and uh given the fact that at the same period the British had also this policy of establishing peasant cooperatives in other colonies So they found it's better to controls to control the associations peasant association instead of leaving them independent and autonomous That was a threat to the whole uh colonial system uh particularly the economic system and therefore in nineteen thirty-two uh the British government decided to enact a law uh the Cooperative Societies Ordinance of nineteen thirty-two which made sure that all peasant associations had to be registered as cooperative uh organisations under that law But then the process of registering uh was not complete That's why you still had some other independent associations being formed up to around nineteen fifty-two So between nineteen thirty-two and nineteen fifty-two only two uh peasant cooperative associations were registered as cooperatives and that was uh the Kilimanjaro Native uh Cooperative Union uh which was The Kilimanjaro Native Planters Association was now registered and changed its name into the Kilimanjaro Native Cooperative Union nineteen thirty-three and nineteen thirty-six uh the <O/> Cooperative Union uh uh which was also registered under this So up to nineteen fifty-two these were the two Otherwise others were still independent and autonomous peasant associations So by nineteen fifty-two the government made sure that all these associations uh had to be registered as peasant cooperatives and uh this time coincided with also the nationalist movement which also encouraged the formation of more peasant cooperatives uh because they very much supported the nationalist movement and therefore you had a rapid expansion of peasant cooperatives between nineteen fifty-two and nineteen sixty-one to the time of independence", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b608afcb-56f7-4c8e-9f4a-729ba0339fbb', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.192102+00:00',

{'text': "Because almost everything that I'd have said has been said and uh that but since I'm the only person in a way in this room a bureaucrat who is <slang/>gonna try to act the academic so I

agriculture and livestock keeping have almost an equal uh social economic and uh political value to the people that practise it as opposed to mixed farming where there could be livestock and real

areas Now we are told it's less about eighty per cent so with a growing urbanisation uh the population that is living in the rural areas is getting smaller but it is still predominant and quite significant and uh at independence agro-pastoralism was limited to a number of places like Karange Mwanza Shinyanga <O/> Iminara region among the <name/> and then among the <name/> then we had only a number of <O/> and then the Turu and all these places we have agro-pastoralists but then we have the pastoral peoples according to researches in the sixties by colleague <name/> and that is among the Barbaig the Barbaig who are groups who are still pastoral You have the Massai They are pastoral Of course the Arusha agro-pastoral around Mount Meru so you have agro-pastoralists in certain areas pastoralism in others and cultivators shifting cultivators in other areas and when you look at the tribal the so-called tribal map drawn in the late fifties it could show you where the Sukuma are living where the Haya are living where the Massai are living all over the country and you could be told they are <O/> they are <O/> et cetera et cetera so you had a landscape which was very clearly limited in terms of geographic collocations of these people so this production system in Tanzania three decades ago was limited to particular areas which were known and in other places like southern Tanzania the biggest in <name/> was the goat They've never seen cattle and some of them saw cattle for the first time in the seventies through government policy and actually they were afraid of milking these animals Now uh what we have now in the three decades is the expansion of agro-pastoralism That's why I'm talking of a changing landscape in the sense that agro-pastoralism the map we have now is different from the map we had at independence of this production system The agro-pastoralism has now burst its borders in terms of the Sukuma who were known to be in Mwanza and Shinyanga They have systematically moved through the <name/> area into some <name/> plains and into the Morogoro region where they are keeping herds of cattle and practising <O/> We have the have the Arusha people who have moved into a mostly entire Massai land where they are practising cultivation in the higher potential areas like we were told the mountain areas or the highland areas where you have <O_><O/> These have been occupied or colonalized by agro-pastoral Arusha in Massai land but they practise agriculture So on the one hand we have the migration and expansion of agro-pastoralism where it has has<_/> been moving physically by people of those communities which were located particularly as in the past moving out with their herds and with their agriculture into new areas so we have some plains which have been occupied now by the Sukuma We have the Mwanzi moving to those areas and in Morogoro area where we have quite a substantial amount of people from those places So this is one phenomenon The other one is where you have pastoralism emerging in former pastoral areas agricultural development and uh pastoral communities have been known of course to consume agricultural goods for a long time People travelled through Massai land in the eighteen-eighties We are saying that the Massai were exchanging their pastoral products for agricultural goods Even during war they will send their women to collect agro-pastoral goods So it's not a phenomenon that is new depending on some of agricultural produce but they never produced these crops themselves They bartered again with other communities and other people and literature on the <name/> or in literature sometimes they are called <name/> they were cultivating and after the wars of the Massai in the eighteenth century they were looked down as people practising agriculture by the other Massai because these were infiltrating These are keeping livestock and nothing else and these others are doing some cultivation and uh so you have this division now there is a trend to move <O/> agriculture in the pastoral areas not depending on the food <O/> but being able to grow them themselves So what I am studying here is not the well-known fact that agriculture has been transported into pastoral areas by land-hungry cultivators agro-pastoralists and commercial farmers and the state projects I am looking into process in which hitherto pastoral communities have or are gradually taking up agriculture for their purpose of dealing with their different needs The reasons are new One Mr Chairman is that productivity of their pastoral system has declined in many parts of Tanzania for many reasons One is the scarcity of land If the high potential areas have been taken over by the cultivators then the system is ready to sustain itself so there are returns on labour alone Again there has been the decline of livestock for many reasons One is of course the shifting of pastures but another is that through government switching from being a provider to a facilitator in the past all the dips and all the agricultural no no the animal health facilities were given for free and suddenly during the crisis the government is unable to provide these services so suddenly the services are not available and then there have been so many debts from this switch from providing to facilitating People are required now to buy sites and borrow other services Some can some cannot and those who can they avoid it They have been used to getting it for free They are not yet doing that So people lost livestock and this process we have uh documented that information We find that people gradually are becoming more dependent on agricultural foods Whereas in the sixties the people from Ngorongo were dependent on agricultural foods for only twenty per cent of their food intake uh in mid-eighties they were dependent on agricultural foods for fifty-three per cent of their food intake so they need nutritional value The way they can combine their foods has been getting you know poorer and poorer uh but another thing is that in the seventies Mr Chairman one head of cattle could purchase could be <O/> for eight bags of maize but today you uh one bag of three bags of maize can be bought by a head of cattle one big head of cattle so the terms of trade have been working against pastoralism against animal production so whereas they could barter more they could barter for more bags of maize or other forms of grain by less heads of cattle they are paying less for more heads of cattle to barter and get maize so there's been some economic motivation that if you can grow the food yourself then you save your herd from deflation but on the other hand is there is this feeling that uh for decades the people have been bombarded by the ideological bullets of the nation state Of course we bureaucrats have been going around telling people you must become agriculturalists you must grow food crops you must grow cash crops and this over a few decades seems to be catching up with the pastoralists and uh in uh all this the Barbaig who were pastoral a few decades ago they are now agro-pastoral You have other people The Massai themselves now are becoming pastoral So the trend is moving on There are those people who are not cattlemen for example but they have taken to agriculture for the cash for a different motive Rather than deflate your <O/> for food you grow that food but then by selling the surplus which you may have acquired from the produce you can buy more <O/> of cattle and do more things with in this way So there are people who are pastoral are pastoralRRR but now aren't pastoral not because they are losing cattle or they are unable to feed themselves sufficiently but because there is this amount So the ideology of the state has been catching up with these people but what does this mean in terms of pastoralism in this new trend It means all the high potential areas that were vital for agro-pastoral for pastoralism because you needed the territory where you can get water salt lakes you can have pastures you can uh all the other things that you need but now the high potential areas are being taken over by individuals from the <O/> because in this system everything that has been put under agriculture becomes kind of <O/> individualized by the individual cultivator but <O_><O/> place as long as it's out there people will be will have access to it It belongs to them all But once you <O/> you take it over and there is this process now that the high potential areas are being taken over now by the outsiders cultivators agro-pastoralists but also pastoralists themselves the Massai are having cultivation so they are also transforming their own resources in that pattern that which used to transform and contain these processes uh To go quickly through these things what I what we have now is you have agro-pastoralism in the former pastoral areas You have agro-pastoralists moving on their way into the new areas so this landscape having changed what is is what does it mean what are the implications More so in terms of policy More so in terms of history-making When we were studying an area say Massai land you are looking at the problems of that particular area sometimes an exclusion of all the other problems around When we are dealing with pastoralism you are looking at the pastoralists their problems their concerns to the exclusion sometimes of all the other <O/> systems Now when you look at this entire trend which is <O_><O/> that uh there are changing structures all over the country we have talked about the legal structures the economic structures the political structures you know the <O/> system has changed What are the implications Let me start with a few The exportation of the pastoralism into areas where it never existed as in the case of the <name/> of Morogoro region There are some plains of <name/> region has increased pressure on the natural resources in the areas due to the increasing demand for fuel wood and drilling poles has subjected forests to greater pressure Wood is obtained from harvest It's obtained from natural forests which take many years to grow <O_><O/> Moreover land has been cleared by the agro-pastoralists who migrate to give way who migrate into new areas <O/> to prepare their own farms because they are rearing livestock <O_><O/> so they are clearing forests and bushes to create new farms in areas where the land was still intact What is more worrying is that these people are moving with their cultural techniques which will not be suitable to the new areas especially the arid and semi-arid areas uh Then in some places they are ploughing by oxen or cows or tractors because the Sukuma are known to be very very very skilled farmers with cotton growing and so on Some of them have moved some of their capital into the new areas where they're ploughing the new areas to create farms and at the same time keep livestock", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1a429bbf-32fd-4d3a-a8a5-574366fe199b', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.193149+00:00', 'english_score': 0.978331446647644,

{'text': "When people finally said no to the dictatorship of their leader the results become riveting Walls crashed Governments crumbled and some of those leaders who were lucky enough to survive are being called upon to account It is important to underline this fact <ea/>Ndugu Principal for far too often the point has been made that the changes there that is in Eastern Europe meant the rejection of socialism by the people that changes in Eastern Europe showed the triumph of capitalism over socialism Nothing in my view could be further more uncertain The people of Eastern Europe asked for greater freedom It would be foolish to conclude that the rejection of socialism and communist parties and their governments in Eastern Europe was also the rejection of socialism and the embracing of capitalism The lessons of Eastern Europe were important to both party and government But there are internal roots to our debate for ours is a dynamic party and therefore given to periodic review of its organisation and performance The difficult economic times and the political and social ills that they were clearly giving rise to made it certain that we would ask ourselves pertinent questions Is our system more open more accessible and effectively reaching out Are our democratic institutions more democratic today Are we positioned within the party and the government to deliver the goods aspired  for> by the people These are not new questions to CCM and the government Self-re-examination and appraisal have been a permanent feature of our evolutionary process We certainly are more democratic day than we have ever been We are amenable to advice from our people We listen to sift and weigh heavily suggestions for change Views so received either directly from the people or through their representatives will be accommodated through the democratic process And since social growth is a dynamic process we will keep on changing with time That is the crux of President Mwinyi's message to Tanzanians last Monday that in implementing the policy of socialism and self-reliance a goal we set ourselves twenty-four years ago we will move with time making changes as appropriate In this respect the democracy debate is important to us to the extent that it provides us another rich source of receiving views from a wider public we commend it and value it highly That people are exercising their democratic right without fear of victimisation whatsoever is a clear demonstration that democratic practice in Tanzania has matured and come of age Having said all this what then is the role of the media in this debate The traditional role of the media of reproducing and reporting views and events will still remain That requires no elaboration But in this debate the media will be additionally expected to promote the debate thus providing useful fora for the airing and presentation of views The commissioners will certainly also be greatly assisted by what the media will be carrying However I must warn against exercising I must warn the media that is against exercising undue influence on the debate I use the phrase undue influence deliberately The media cannot possibly distance themselves from the debate The selection one makes of participants in a radio discussion for example is itself a form of influence Similarly the selection of letters on the debate which will appear in the readers' columns of newspapers is a form of influence In both cases some views are read others are not Some views are heard others are not That is what the process of selection is about and that is where the influence flows In these circumstances what I am calling upon the media to do is to ensure that all sides of the debate are heard and that contributors be presented in the full vigour of their eloquence You would be doing a disservice to the debate if for example you published or aired the most illiterate and incoherent advocacy of one side or another in the debate Additionally however the media must moderate the language of the debate In this charge of the responsibility to direct the debate which the media inherently has presentations should be encouraged to address issues and not personalities On the record so far it seems to me there has been a visible tendency for contributors to go for the person rather than the argument for abuse rather than ratiocination It is important to remember that we are not embarked upon a public contestation of patriotism We should be engaged rather in a comprehensive reasoned analysis of the political economic social and constitutional circumstances now obtaining in our country the problems they give rise to and the kinds of institutional and behavioural arrangements that can improve performance in all these areas while strengthening the unity and stability of the country Personal abuse and a foul tongue do not conduce to such an outcome and the media must not be seen to be promoting them <ea/>Ndugu Principal the power of the pen and the microphone should be used in this debate demonstrably fairly and clearly The language should be concise unambiguous and presentable devoid of libellous imputation of motives The debate will be healthier if we participants exercise great restraint and arguments follow a logical pattern without rancour and insinuations The importance of having an unfettered truly free debate cannot be overstated To this end I have special appeal  to the official media The official media's editorial comments tend to be seen by the average person to reflect official view in every respect and on every occasion Now you and I know that that cannot be the case The Monday morning editorial comment for instance on the latest league match brawl on the pitch on Saturday will not necessarily be the official view of the event Indeed there may in fact be no official view on it at all but as I say many will think that there is an official view if they read the editorial comment and that the editorial reflects that official view For this reason I urge that in the process and underline the word process in the process of the debate I urge the official media to exercise great care and circumspection in editorialising on the substance of the debate I want to repeat that I urge that in the process of the debate the official media exercise great care and circumspection in editorialising on the substance of the debate I stress the word substance for the manner in which the debate is conducted is clearly a subject of fair comment But pronouncing on the substance puts you in danger of putting pressure on the commission and <ea/>wananchi straight-jacketing the debate and predetermining its outcome That of course runs counter to the aspirations of the party the government and the people To the print media I commend the trite and true observation that a newspaper should be the maximum of information and the minimum of comment certainly on this subject Ladies and gentlemen we have over the years built up a tradition in this country of democracy and making decisions through popular participation and national consensus We will want to uphold that enviable record It is a record indeed that has been one of the secrets behind our national stability It is the foundation upon which we can confidently negotiate a prosperous entry into the new millennium I now have a great pleasure to declare this encounter open Thank you very much", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd77f939e-ceee-4f13-a625-e51870cb46c9',

{'text': "In my view I think the Minister's statement or speech has been it's all embracing He has I think he has left no stone unturned on attitudes on uh behaviour on reactions and on the party philosophy and intentions on this national issue But he has underlined certain areas which are a primary interest calling for reaction  from journalists in terms of their behaviour their role in this particular sensitive historical and I must say very important debate in the history of our nation Well the whole world is said to be on the verge of a new new venture which has been precipitated by the changes in Europe Older military alliances are now becoming allies But whereas in the past they were enemies now they have to be they are becoming allies and they have to work together towards new goals and uh if these superpowers if these uh great industrial affluent nations of the world be coming together what will be the impact of all that  on developing countries or  on Tanzania in particular So in order to be fair and I think to be to have an intelligent approach to this whole issue of political discussion and political uh impending political change in Tanzania I think the journalist's role will only be effective if he will look at certain important parameters that would have tremendous influence on his judgement conscience therefore his choice of words therefore his selection of candidates selection of material parameters which would influence the journalist as an agent of social change which will influence him how to be effective in his particular role in this particular debate Well having said that I think the minister if I understood him  rightly he's demanding only quality he's demanding a better quality of journalism well not only in traditional matters but more importantly in this particular phase in this particular era of our country But to be a good journalist or a bad journalist uh Internationally we are said to be to belong to a highly cultured profession I tend to agree yes because the nature of our training the sophistication of the science of communication and journalism certainly it places us all these factors place us in that unique position to be able to to play a particular role of special significance in our societies because we have that training But surprisingly in the end equipped with professional training there are questions of etiquette there are questions of finesse You may know your content but if you don't write or broadcast with etiquette with finesse certainly it will be reflected in the end-result of your work So the journalist trained or untrained  but> he still has the individual responsibility to raise his own standard as a journalist by developing qualities which he may not necessarily uh find them in the classroom and the end product has got to reflect etiquette has got to balance to reflect a balanced view Abusive language in our copy can only be attributed to lack of etiquette because you don't have to abuse people You don't have to use abusive language intentionally or unconsciously and expect to be taken or to be understood as a fantastic journalist There is no wisdom in using harsh language So if the tools of our work  are words we have the responsibility to choose those words which are not loaded with abuse This is what I think and this is what I believe So maybe I have discussed the qualities of a journalist his conscience and maybe his approach to these matters But in this particular discussion which will affect all Tanzanians because it is a democratic discussion and one good thing or bad thing about democracy is the fact that all those involved have the same right or rights so who should be given prominence who should be treated as second class or who can want for his opinion to be heard later In which case political questions democratic questions of this nature have got to be seen as they are but I think more importantly have got to be seen from their political perspectives Our contribution as individuals or as journalists or as those people who are placed in a position to influence to guide to balance the debate we have to take into account certain factors which are very important  I'd like to suggest that it is important to know historical uh the political history of Zanzibar which led to the revolution Why did people had to take up arms to kill other people What underlying factors mobilised the people to that type of action Then you will be able to appreciate certain milestones in the political processes of Zanzibar Likewise what happened in nineteen fifty-four How was TANU organised Who did it and what transpired from that time to date Is there anything to appreciate in all these processes Or is the whole process worth condemnation So in discussing issues of this nature I think we have also to take into account instead of uh just jumping or looking at the political discussions and political changes  for> the journalist placed as he is I think he should have a much wider perspective much depth in the issues to be able to appreciate uh uh contributions of other people to be able to frame his questions and to be able to uh play an effective role in this crucial and historical debate Ladies and gentlemen having said that uh Mr Chairman I thank you very much", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source':

Lindi Tunduma - Sumbawanga Dar es Salaam city roads and many others  For> those who were here in March nineteen ninety-one may recall that Honourable Malecela was the guest of honour at the launching ceremony of the Roads Integrated Project Phase One And when invited and when we invited him again to open this conference he accepted it without any hesitation But due to some unavoidable reasons Honourable Malecela had to leave for another very important meeting in Japan He has instead sent to us Honourable Mkapa Minister for Higher Education Science and Technology to open this very important meeting on his behalf I hope you'll agree with me Mr Chairman that we should consider ourselves greatly honoured by his response to our invitation Honourable Minister Mkapa before you are distinguished guests from embassies based in Tanzania representatives from donor agencies principal secretaries uh Minister for Communication Transport Regional Development Directors Heads of Department sections from my ministry headquarters and we have here all regional engineers from Tanzania mainland We wish to thank them for having accepted our invitation to this very important conference which will run for two consecutive days beginning today the fourth of October Our main expectation  from this conference is for the delegates to review the objectives of RIP Two its scope and its funding requirements After this donors will be asked to comment and express their interests on individual pro-project components Mr Chairman I hope you remember that a similar representation participated  in the first donors' conference of the transport sector held also in Arusha some time in December nineteen eighty-seven for the same objective though for RIP One It is quite a consolation to say that the outcome after that donors' conference in nineteen eighty-seven and other subsequent conferences in terms of physical achievement on road network is quite remarkable Let me take this opportunity Mr Chairman to just mention a few completed road projects since we began implementation of RIP One Among the bitumen roadworks completed todate are Morogoro - Mikumi which is seventy-three kilometres Igawa - Igurusi which is fifty-nine fifty-eight kilometres Chalinze - Segera which is one seventy-four kilometres Same - Himo eighty-two kilometres Bukumbi - Isaka one fourteen kilometres and among bitumen roads under construction and rehabilitation are the Dar es Salaam - Chalinze hundred kilometres Mikumi - Kitonga forty-nine kilometres Igurusi - Songwe ninety-one kilometres Segera - Tanga seventy-one kilometres Kibiti - Ikwiriri twenty-nine kilometres Kwabero - Nyakasanza fifty-nine kilometres Musoma - Sirari ninety-two kilometres As for the gravel roads' construction and rehabilitation for the trunk and rural roads there is also good progress I hope every one of us has already seen this with his or her own eyes It is through these positive results Mr Chairman that this donors' conference was planned so that pockets which could not be filled under RIP one be considered now for RIP Two Other road sections such as Tanga - Horohoro Marangu - Tarachea etcetera have been tendered and are now in the negotiation stage while the extreme and design work in fund mobilization is still going on for such roads as Dodoma - Singida Mikumi - Ifakara Mtukula - Msaunga to mention just a few of them Of course we have the Mwanza - Shinyanga border road tender already floated and opening is on the twenty-ninth October this year This is beside many regional roads which have already been tendered for bidding The third major component Mr Chairman for RIP involves studies ranging from feasibility studies and bridge designs to office management Eighteen different studies have been carried out and these are at different stages of completion Honourable chief guest and distinguished participants it will be appreciated that RIP will be appreciated that RIPRRR is a large and complex project which needs close co-ordination I'm glad to report that there's been very good co-operation and co-ordination not only at the project execution level but also at the donors' and at the inter-ministerial levels The ministry has also organised internal workshops every year to discuss implementation bottlenecks and chart out solutions The last such workshop was held only last week in these same premises we are in today May I therefore take this opportunity Mr Chairman to thank all those who have worked tirelessly to ensure the success of the first RIP It is their efforts which have enabled us to embark on this second phase of the project To a large extent Mr Chairman our success is also attributed to the reforms which you've undertaken since the commencement of the project Much has been done to streamline the organisation at the ministry's headquarters and at the regions' levels also The regional engineers have also been delegated greater responsibilities in execution of roadworks These reforms are still going on and very soon we shall take another step forward through the appointment of a central road board which will have a strong representation of the road users The intention is to make the organisation more responsive to the needs of the road user If I can just mention that up to now <idiom> we have started regional road boards under the chairmanship of the regional commissioners in every region and the members of these regional road boards are government leaders at different levels and their responsibilities are to advise the Minister of Works on the rehabilitation uh repair work and other uh jobs concerning our roads At the same time I wish to call upon all those who did not live up to our expectations to pull up their socks Indeed we cannot condone such people for too long because this will jeopardise the success of the project So far we have tried to tolerate them to some extent because one of the objectives of the project is to develop local expertise However there is a limit to which we can continue to tolerate them especially when the source of their their non-performance is negligence or sheer incompetence Mr Chairman it is now my intention it is not my intention to turn this address into another long speech so could you please allow me to welcome Honourable Benjamin Mkapa Minister of Higher Education Science and Technology on behalf of the Prime Minister and First Vice-President of the United Republic of Tanzania to deliver his long awaited opening address to this conference Honourable Minister <ea/>karibu", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'e0863343-9bd2-423f-a4f2-de64168e5bd3', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.194975+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9631944298744202, 'non_english_score': 0.036805570125579834}

in order to facilitate my discharging this responsibility this morning The Prime Minister and First Vice-President's remarks to you this morning are as follows \nYour Excellencies Honourable Ministers representatives of donor agencies Principal Secretaries distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen first let me sincerely express my gratitude and delight for this privilege and honour accorded to me to speak to you this morning This assembly brings together heads and members of the diplomatic corps heads of donor agencies honourable ministers principal secretaries and other senior government officials On behalf of the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania I wish to welcome you all I wish to extend special welcome to those of you who have had to travel long distances to be with us here in Arusha and to this important donors' conference We appreciate very much your support in an efforts to improve the transport sector as part and parcel of the National Economic Recovery Programme Your Excellencies and distinguished guests let me start by giving you a little history of why we are here today Tanzania like many developing countries has had quite ambitious development programmes Right after independence we started to chart out long-term development strategies First we had three-year development programmes followed by five-year development programmes In all these programmes transport and particularly road development featured very highly Several new roads were built to a bitumen standard These included the Tanzam highway nine hundred and fifty kilometres and the Chalinze - Segera and the Mkumbara - Kisangiro roads three hundred kilometres Mtwara - Masasi two hundred kilometres which were built between nineteen sixty-eight and nineteen seventy-five Thousands of kilometres of gravel roads were also constructed Throughout these plans our emphasis was on development which was synonymous with new construction Little attention was given to preservation and maintenance of the transport infrastructure Efforts by the government to try and address the problem of road maintenance started in the late nineteen seventies with trunk road maintenance projects which were supported by the World Bank These however turned out to be half measures and did not succeed to arrest the fast deterioration of the road network Your Excellencies and distinguished guests by the mid nineteen eighties it had become evident that the deterioration of the transport infrastructure was cause for alarm The manifestations can be summarised as follows\nA The condition of most rural roads was poor and transport to villages restricted to dry seasons\nB The trunk road network had deteriorated to such an extent that only about forty per cent of the trunk road network was in good condition severely increasing the cost of transport and curtailing the movement of goods\nC The trucking sub-sector which accounts for over seventy per cent of agricultural produce haulage from rural areas had been allowed to deteriorate due to lack of foreign exchange to replace the aged fleet as well as to maintain the fleet in running condition with spare parts and tyres \nE Inadequate trucking capacity coupled with low operational efficiency of parastatal trucking fleet had prevented the trucking sub-sector from coping with the surge in agricultural production following implementation of the Economic Recovery Programme\nF The two railways which are strategically located to carry majority of long distance domestic and transit traffic were able to carry home only fifteen per cent of the total goods movement in the country and \nH Due to deteriorated berth and equipment the ports were unable to adequately accommodate the import and export traffic of the country nor compete effectively against other regional ports for transit traffic of neighbouring land-locked countries As a consequence of this pathetic state of the transportation infrastructure and the resultant unsatisfactory operational efficiency progress on the government's Economic Recovery Programme was stalled It was against this background that the government convened the transport sector donors' conference in December nineteen eighty-seven here in Arusha At that conference documents entitled Programme for Transport Sector Recovery outlined the basic policy institutional changes and rehabilitation requirements of the economy Also a draft national transport policy was presented to the donors Your Excellencies and distinguished guests the nineteen eighty-seven Arusha strategy for the transport sector entailed the following\nA Systematic efforts to be made to improve the operational efficiency of the sector\nB Financial performance and cost recovery to be improved throughout the transport sector\nC Increasing resource allocation to the transport sector particularly for roads\nD Improving the utilisation of existing asserts through improving the management and operations\nE Concentrating future efforts on rehabilitation and maintenance of the basic road network\nF Adjusting institutional structures consistent with effectively carrying out the required rehabilitation maintenance and operations\nG Top priority to be given to maintenance funds' allocation for roads which had fallen far short of requirement in the past and\nH To secure the maximum possible foreign exchange allocation for road maintenance as well for current operational requirements of trucking railways and aviation sub-sectors\nLooking at the individual sectors and sub-sectors The railway subsector At a separate donors' conference in February nineteen eighty-seven the government and TRC adopted the Emergency Recovery Programme aimed at rehabilitating and strengthening the operations and management system for Tanzania Railways Corporation Under the programme it was agreed to concentrate all investments in the rehabilitation of key assets and to improve operating capacity through managerial improvements under a ten point programme TAZARA since nineteen eighty-four has been implementing a ten-year development plan with donor support for twenty-three project items to bring up its operations near to the effective installed capacity The port subsector Your Excellencies and distinguished guests the strategy for the port subsector was to continue with the modernisation of the Port of Dar es Salaam which had started in nineteen eighty-five and included the rehabilitation of the berths and cargo handling equipment coupled with training and technical assistance to improve efficiency in cargo handling for both container and general cargo As for the aviation subsector the government economic recovery strategy in the civil aviation sub-sector included measures intended to improve the condition in the in the subsector as follows\nA Carrying out a study to rationalise Air Tanzania Corporation's overhead and support structure to improve its productivity including possible need of technical assistance\nB Formulating a staged programme to increase fares for domestic market to ensure full cost recovery in the provision of services by ATC and introduce a more flexible mechanism to enable fair adjustment on a timely basis\nC Limiting capital investment by ATC until such time as a rational development and financial strategy could be developed\nD Pursuing an open-sky policy allowing local charter airlines to provide domestic scheduled services to meet the demand for air transport\nE To improve and rehabilitate aerodromes within the framework of recommendations of a development study to be undertaken\nThe road transport subsector Your Excellencies and distinguished guests the strategy for the trucking subsector focused on the importation of requirements including an accelerated replacement programme for aged trucks and continued support for importing spare parts fuel and raw materials for tyre production to alleviate rural transport andmarketing of agricultural commodities In the short term the government agreed to allow market forces to determine the appropriate level of interregional trucking tariffs with a view to allowing the operators to recover their operating costs and to realise a reasonable return on their assets And in the long term to review the role and function of RETCOs and other state-owned transport agencies The roads' subsector The roads' subsector strategy comprises a comprehensive approach which entailed integrating the implementation of key road investments with major policy and institutional reforms such as\nA Rehabilitating and improving the priority trunk and rural roads essential for evacuation of agricultural products\nB Strengthening the administration and management of trunk and regional roads in order to maintain the rehabilitated roads network in satisfactory condition\nC Enhancing road maintenance capacity in the country through promotion and use of local contractors\nD Improving the availability of road maintenance equipment through encouraging the establishment of commercially operated plant pools\nE Improving resource mobilisation and allocation in order to provide for adequate maintenance of truck and regional road networks and \nF Re-orienting public expenditure to increase the overall size of the road budget and to allocate adequate funds for road maintenance and rehabilitation \nAchievements of the strategies under the programme for transport sector recovery Your Excellencies and distinguished guests I'm glad to report that since nineteen eighty-seven the government has taken a number of key policy and institutional actions that are needed to attain the physical targets spelt out in the transport sector recovery strategy In particular in the railway subsector under a memorandum of understanding between TRC and the Government TRC has been allowed to operate on commercial basis thereby setting salaries and taking other decisions without reference to government It is heartening to note that sincefiscal year nineteen ninety-one TRC has been making an operating profit With regard to the port subsector in order to recover the investment under the port modernisation project and to cope with the fall in the value of the shilling the government has allowed THA to increase tariffs which had not been changed since nineteen eighty-four Furthermore measures to commercialise THA are under way and towards this end the Dar es Salaam port development master plan study and the commercialisation study are planned Turning to the aviation subsector in March nineteen ninety-two the government made several important and bold decisions on the future of ATC as follows\nOne ATC shall continue to exist but shall operate on a commercial basis generating a profit\nTwo Government will absorb a large part of AT's debt in order to make corporations' balance sheet attractive to private investors\nThree Allowing ATC to sell some of its assets generating funds to pay off creditors and to improve its working capital position \nAnd Four Giving ATC the autonomy to set tariffs and the mandate to gradually withdraw its services from the loss-making roots The civil aviation board has implemented the open-sky policy by granting operating licences to other operators to compete with ATC And government has commissioned a study to look into the restructuring of the directorate of civil aviation and the creation of a national airports authority to manage operate and maintain the major airports However government will continue to provide for the uneconomical airports especially in the remote areas With regard to the road transport subsector the availability of vehicles transport inputs and spares has been greatly enhanced through the liberalisation of imports of vehicles and spare parts using own or the open general licence funds as well as direct support by donors and grants from friendly countries And the government has endeavoured to improve passenger and goods transport operations in rural areas by exempting all vehicles of carrying capacity of over three tons and buses of twenty-five passengers capacity from import duty and sales tax Furthermore the government has allowed UDA and the private operators to earn a reasonable return on their investments Turning to the road sub-sector investment priorities have been re-oriented to road rehabilitation and maintenance Furthermore and this is very important the budget re-allocations for road maintenance are being increased annually For instance government funds for annual routine and periodic road maintenance have increased by two hundred and fifty per cent from about United States dollars four point nine million in fiscal year nineteen eighty-seven eighty-eight to US dollars seventeen million in fiscal year nineteen ninety-two ninety-three Since nineteen ninety-one ninety-two fiscal year revenue for road maintenance is being collected mainly from road users through the imposition of a levy on fuel consumption which is deposited into a designated roads' fund In Ministry of Works the institutional framework for planning managing and maintaining the roads networks has been restructured through the following measures\nOne The creation of the division for roads and aerodromes\nTwo The decentralisation of authority for implementing road maintenance and works to the twenty regional engineers offices\nThree Under IRP various donors are funding technical assistance teams in eleven regions to strengthen the execution capacity for maintaining the roads by the Regional Engineers' offices\nFour Under the IRP umbrella donors are supporting well-defined programmes at the University of Dar es Salaam Engineering Faculty Technical Colleges of Dar es Salaam and Arusha Ministry of Works' Training Institute at Morogoro and at the National Institute of Transport Execution capacity for maintaining the road network is being improved through the REO's by gradually increasing the contracting out of road maintenance works Also under UNDP ILO support a programme to train local contractors in rural road rehabilitation and maintenance using labour-based methods started in Kilimanjaro region in nineteen ninety-two and the programme will be extended to other regions soon And Ministry of Works roads building equipment has been transferred to a plant and equipment hire company which started hiring to REO's and contractors at commercial rates with effect from July nineteen ninety-two What has been the impact of the programme for the transport sector recovery Your Excellencies and distinguished guests much progress has been made in the last six years of the implementation of the programme for the transport sector recovery Assessment of the impact of the programme on the economy shows that mobility has increased dramatically where road conditions have improved and that crops cereals and fresh fruits and vegetables are now moving more easily from the farms to the processing and storage centres and to the markets In specific terms the impact can be said to be as follows Within the railways the haulage of transit traffic which earns foreign exchange for the country has improved more than a hundred per cent since fiscal year nineteen ninety-one Also there are significant improvements on the movement of export commodities such as coffee With regard to the ports the average ship stay time in port has gone down to three days as opposed to eight days before the implementation of the port modernisation project The overall productivity of the port has improved appreciably The average gang output for general cargo is now two hundred and fifty tons per shift compared to about a hundred tons in the mid nineteen eighties The average container dwell time has reduced from about fifty days to an average of only about thirteen days In a nutshell the improved productivity of the port which led to savings in transit costs has made the Dar es Salaam port much more competitive with other regional ports With regard to the roads and road transports improved road conditions have led to shorter travel times This has been most significant along the Tanzam highway between Dar es Salaam and Zambia and along the Northern route to Kenya through Chalinze Segera Moshi and Arusha including the branch to Tanga In fact the travel time between Dar es Salaam and Arusha six hundred and fifty kilometres is now less than nine hours compared to fourteen hours before implementation of the IRP Additionally buses are now travelling regularly to many regional and district centres which were isolated before road works and maintenance started under IRP Also traffic volumes have generally doubled on those forecast in the feasibility studies for sections that have undergone rehabilitation under IRP which shows the impact of good roads on personal mobility and freight movement", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL',

Musurili coastal zone also in Northern Mozambique awaiting to get < funding at this stage Equally a national environmental management programme which we call NEMP is at present being prepared It will consist of an environmental policy and environmental registration and a programme of principal activities that is sectorial and thematic plans of action The final product aimed is a policy document In the course of preparation of this document training public awareness building intersectoral sectorial harmonisation of plans and community participation  are part of the process One of the major components of this programme is the preparation of the integrated coastal zone management plan We have so far approached IUCN for guidance using their experience in this field Not only such a plan will assist us in the co-ordination of institutional responsibilities in the coastal areas but also it will be an occasion for closer approximation with local amenities and interest groups It will also be an occasion to test our models of community management of natural resources Lack of financial resources is the major constraint in this process which we consider important for Mozambique However we are encouraged with the experience of the Seychelles which has successfully accomplished a similar process Their experience will be important for other countries of the region including my country And I've been very much pleased to understand that other countries have accomplished the same programme In regional terms Mozambique has been active in promoting regional co-operation on environmental managemental matters As President of the <name> commission on lake and river bases and a member of <name> bureau our membership earmarked bureau and our signature to the bio-diversity and climate change conventions last year in Rio de Janeiro are but a few contributions that Mozambique has made to regional and international efforts on environment and we shall continue to do our duties Mr Chairman I hope that Mozambique's coastal problems are not unique to the region Our problems are probably larger due to our relatively long coast line as my colleague from Madagascar has just pointed thus demanding from us heavier financial resources and more trained people Mozambique feels that regional co-operation should be a key to our programmes Co-ordinated research activities on fauna flora sea erosion patterns pollution and overall planning should be co-ordinated and disseminated so as to rationalise resources We feel that scientists should work with the governments also in order to commit them to environmental priority programmes and awareness The strengthening of existing research institutions where they do exist and opening them for regional co-operation and exchange could in no doubt rationalise our small resources A regional data bank on sea management for the countries of the region could be of great importance Donor countries and Unep could play an important role in this gigantic effort We countries of the region should be capable to monitor and manage the environment correctly and efficiently in the shortest possible period Equally important is the institutional building and strengthening This will help to manage and implement policies and national laws effectively Integrating the policies and laws into economic development programmes will require strong institutions The Mozambican constitution has integrated in its nineteen ninety constitution a number of important articles defining the environment and its role  in the development and as well and well-being of its people Mr Chairman let me take this opportunity to thank you and the Government of the Republic of Tanzania for the warm and brotherly hospitality given to us Kindly convey  gratitude and thanks to your government and people Many thanks to the Swedish Government and the Swedish agency for research and co-operation for support given to the environmental programmes in our region including my country I hope they will continue enriching our programmes To FAO IOC SIDA and UNEP our whole and total recognition for their constant support to our governments for environmental programmes so important to the overall economy and social development of our region Many thanks for your attention Thank you very much", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'f1ebdd26-5e03-4da1-875e-ea89887a3876', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.197375+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9551392793655396, 'non_english_score': 0.04486072063446045}

coastal belt of Mozambique is carrying  on immense activities which can hamper uh marine aqua-systems and coastal environments So we're very much moved  byour experience Well I call upon Honourable Minister Mrs Diesen Jorreh Minister for the Environment Economic Planning and External relations of the Republic of Seychelles Honourable Minister will you please take the place of honour\n<$A> Mr Chairman ministers distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen it is somewhat most formidable task to take the floor when one is at the end of the list However I hope that you will bear with me for a few minutes I am most pleased and honoured to participate as a member of the East African group uh and also as a member of the Indian Ocean States community in this conference I am hopeful that together we shall be able to come up with some innovative decisions for the region which will contribute towards the achievement of the <name/> division for the people of the earth This policy conference on integrated coastal zone management in the East African region is long overdue I must congratulate the Government of Tanzania and SAREC the organisers for taking the initiatives in ensuring that policy makers are given the opportunity to discuss the issues relating to coastal zone management and the sustainability of their coastal zones within a regional frame work The ocean has always been at the centre of our pre-occupations It provides us with food and leisure It influences our climate and it is the basis of our livelihood especially for those of us who rely on tourism fisheries and maritime trade In so far as Seychelles is concerned the republic comprises of more than a hundred islands with a land area of only four hundred and fifty square kilometres Just our exclusive economic zone extends over one point two million square kilometres as much as the land area of Tanzania for instance Our population is jut over seventy thousand Tourism accounts for fifteen per cent of the country's GNP Tourism activities forty-five per cent fisheries for twelve per cent and fisheries related activities for two per cent Thus Seychelles depends on its renewable natural resources for at least seventy-four per cent of its GNP In this respect all development has been geared to take advantage of the economic opportunities afforded by our coastal and ocean environments Ninety per cent of our population and infrastructure are located on the narrow strip of the coast line on one island The competition for space along the coast will become more pronounced in the years to come The growth of industries may compound the existing problems of waste treatment and disposal The ecological and aesthetic functions of coastal and marine habitats may be affected drastically since the Seychelles Islands' ecosystems contain a very high percentage of endemic species of plants and animals found nowhere else in the world The government of Seychelles is aware of these problems It has always recognised the challenge of development that is family based on the twin principles of sustainability of natural resources and the integrity of the coastal ocean environment We feel therefore that the marine environment must be given the attention it deserves and that the use and development of the world's coastal resources must be governed by a coherent global policy This principle was endorsed at Rio Earth Summit last November sorry November the Seychelles Government together with the Swedish agencies of Stockholm Environment Institute and SAREC organised the first column for East and South African countries on sustainable development The Seychelles government is fully committed to this vision of a holistic development of the world's coastal zones and oceans The need for an integrated approach to the management and sustainable development of coastal zones including the exclusive economic zones is of critical importance In the environmental management plan for Seychelles which integrates development and environment the coastal management programme accounts for a significant proportion of the projects Implementation of the programme has started at both the national and regional levels Financing for this has been secured from the EEC and the World Bank Discussions have started with agencies like IUCN SAREC UNESCO regarding the setting up of a marine sciences research centres But to date no firm commitment has been received There have been proposals though to develop training programmes which could be partly localised or regionalized in order to make the training more relevant and cost effective As a small island state with all the inherent constraints of scarce land space limited resources dispersion and isolation lack of economies of scale the government of Seychelles would like to underline the facts that the coastal environment is of paramount importance and constitutes an invaluable development resource Island states in the Indian Ocean and Eastern African region should be accorded special recognition in the same way that the Caribbean and Pacific countries are designated as special development groupings requiring special assistance We believe therefore that there is an urgent need to strengthen and establish appropriate co-ordinating mechanisms for integrated management and sustainable development of coastal and marine areas and their resources for the region as a whole Duplication should be avoided Maximum use should be made of existing institutions and successful programmes at national regional intraregional and international levels", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '2402cac0-5fd7-44ca-a688-a481e26dd121', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.197399+00:00',

{'text': "<$A> Honourable Horace Kolimba Member of Parliament Secretary-General <name> distinguished guests uh members of TAPO ladies and gentlemen it is indeed an honour and pleasure for me to welcome our distinguished chief guest Honourable Horace Kolimba to officiate the opening of our sixth Tanzanian Association of Parastatal Organisations Symposium Honourable chief guest the audience in front of you are essentially the chief executives of parastatal organisations in Tanzania TAPO was founded in nineteen eighty-one principally to promote co-ordinated efforts in managing our economy and to create a forum for improved communication and dialogue between the government and our parastatal organisations with an overall aim of promoting corporate excellency and effectiveness It has been customary for us to hold every year a symposium to review and exchange ideas on current issues which have particular bearing on the performance of our organisations The theme for this year's symposium is  on> commercialization of parastatals in Tanzania Recent years have seen increased interest not only  in the performance but also  in the justification of public enterprises in Tanzania in the wake of their discernible inability to assist in propping up our ailing economy and the recognition that they're in fact substantially accountable for the present ills of the economy Our symposium last year therefore focused on searching for various options and conceptual frameworks under which our troubled parastatal organisations could be restructured back into viable entities Indeed we managed to cover valuable ground in respect of gaining a deeper insight  into the factors at the root of our problems their complexity and possible direction we ought to be moving to redress uh these particular problems Inadequate play of market forces in the operational environment of parastatal organisations in Tanzania however stood out through and through as one of the more basic and major  constraints affecting performance Studies in countries grappling with a similar phenomenon have indicated that this is not a problem peculiar to Tanzania It is a typical problem and certainly the leading factor which has retarded economic growth and even brought about turmoil among centrally planned economies dominated by state-run enterprises There is now a consensus that transformation into market friendly economies with a greater dictation of market driven forces in determining their location of resources and economic activity  much more participation in the state in business and the increasing exposure to domestic and international competition hold the key to the infusion of innovation efficiency and improved productivity among public enterprises and their economies at large In this year's symposium we have thus chosen to extend our last year's discussion on parastatal restructure by examining in greater focus the aspect of parastatal commercialization which is seen as an important vehicle towards comprehensive restructuring and one having potentially rapid dividends in rehabilitating our parastatal organisations Honourable chief guests commercialization of parastatal organisations will characteristically entail dismantling of all forms of government non-tariff protection or any preferential treatment or insulation of our parastatals against domestic and foreign competitors It will also call for significant withdrawal of government interference in the management of parastatal organisations with parallel concessions on parastatal autonomy One is happy to note that we have made some modest beginning in some of these matters albeit in patches and within a disjointed and ambivalent policy environment It is still a fact however that effective commercialization of a parastatal organisation is an important if not a necessary transient step before embarking into comprehensive restructuring which has to deal with the complex and emotive issues of closure play-offs divestiture privatization and has in any case to move cautiously and in phases Commercialization should also be able to facilitate attraction of joint-venture partners and private investors into rehabilitating our ailing parastatal organisations and even enhancing the value of their equity sale In view of the urgency to get our economic enterprises to contribute to the growth and development of our country however we have to move away now from mere conceptualization of the problem at hand into developing and urgently a concrete action programme for commercializing and restructuring our parastatal organisations We need however to have an appropriate operating framework to guide us in doing this exercise successfully A plausible framework in developing a sound action programme for restructuring public enterprises in Tanzania will have to reflect an evolutionary and a total systems approach process Five systematic stages which I consider basic in this process are problem identification fixing desired objectives uh setting up implementation strategies identification and planning of tactics and finally diagnosis and action implementation requirements The first stage towards developing a sound commercialization or restructuring packages for imbattled parastatal organisations is to identify the specific problems and factors behind poor performance for each respective organisation This these factors will be sustained operating losses for instance or non-competitiveness in the domestic or international markets or excessive cost to the consumers etcetera etcetera Once the problems are known it will be possible then to move to the second stage which involves pinpointing objectives of the intended remedial action Some of these objectives for restructuring will be efficiency competitiveness profitability elimination of subsidies or disengagement from excessive bank borrowing uh dependence \nThe third stage comprises  of> evaluating and selecting appropriate strategies for achieving each parastatal organisation's major objective uh restructuring The fourth stage focuses on developing specific tactics needed to carry the sale of shares that equity shops sell to local or foreign investors etcetera The fifth and final stage in this process is consideration of the implementation requirements Both comprehensive restructuring and prior to that commercialization of parastatal organisations in Tanzania call into play important implementation implications which will have to be addressed effectively in the interest of drawing up a viable action programme Chief among these is the need to create a central organ preferably parastatal reform commission to develop policy and to plan co-ordinate and supervise the implementation of parastatal commercialization and restructuring in Tanzania The complexity of the exercise imposes uh <O/> some organisational demands and nothing short of a strong and independent body capable of looking at the problem globally comprehensively and systematically in well-conceived phases can assure us success The introduction of  an> appropriate and adequate financial intermediaries such as merchant banks stock exchange and capital markets which take time to set up and function will have to be carefully planned and made to move harmoniously with the programmed restructuring There is also the question of ethnic balance in equity ownership which deserves due attention as well as how to promote indigenous entrepreneurs to participate fully in the uh privatised or semi-privatised uh enterprises Further down there are issues of evolving appropriate legislation and defining areas for institutional and infrastructural building by the central government in order to create an enabling environment for corporate excellence All these will require the co-ordination and direction of a PAFU central organ The other critical implementation requirement in the process of commercialization and ultimate comprehensive restructuring of parastatal organisations in Tanzania is the backing of a strong political wing and unambiguous commitment  to these measures  of the government and the party In all fairness these elements are presently in serious > deficiency although there have been some uh discussions in the last few uh days An improvement in posture is extremely vital and for a start it could be reflected by the government and the party addressing more seriously the question of setting up the stock exchange market by say in Tanzania getting experienced professionals as the International Finance Company Corporation IFC to undertake a thorough study and make recommendations on needed course of action instead of the present haphazard handling of the matter Honourable chief guests these are but a few uh pertinent observations that should not be overlooked in our endeavour to restructure our parastatal organisations Much more and in  a> finer detail will be taken up in the following papers to be presented and discussed in this symposium The ideal cord of relationship between the shareholder parity ministry holding corporations and operating companies uh by the Principal Secretary <ea/>Ndugu <name> the Minister of Finance performance contracts by Professor Trivedi the World Bank Resource person commercialization the Nigerian experience by Mr Hamsa Said Evaluating of the function rules of holding companies by uh Dr Moshi from University of Dar es Salaam and uh I don't know whether <name> is here but he was supposed to speak on on technicalities of privatizations privatization uh negotiations and completion of contracts Honourable chief guest you'll notice that some of the presentations will be made by the World Bank Resource persons This is due to accommodating of late request to TAPO by the PresidentÕs office and <name> to provide a forum at this symposium for the viewpoints and experiences of the World Bank on commercialization and privatization under the belief that the exposure gained could assist our chief executives in formulating more effective strategies and action programmes for restructuring our ailing public enterprises TAPO on its part welcomes any well-meant collaborative spirit and will certainly take up all valuable contributions from the World Bank insofar as they conform to our practical needs and the objective uh circumstances of our environment Honourable chief guest weÕre all keenly aware of the special impetus that could be given to the whole process of commercialization and restructuring of our parastatal organisations if the party committed greater political will and leadership to parastatal reform Your acceptance to inaugurate this symposium today is a reflection that to a certain degree the party in general and yourself in particular have a favourable disposition to this endeavour \n<$B> to all degree\n<$A> to all degree On behalf of TAPO members I thank you most sincerely for your interest with above remarks and I have the pleasure in inviting you honourable chief guest to address this gathering and declare the nineteen ninety-one TAPO symposium open Thank you very much",

{'text': "Honourable C G Kahama Director of IPC distinguished leaders government officials dear guests ladies and gentlemen I'm very pleased to have been invited to open the first Investment Promotion seminar organized by the Investment Promotion Centre I would like therefore to thank the Director General and the IPC staff firstly for giving me this opportunity to participate in this seminar and secondly for making Moshi as a starting point As pointed out by Director General our region has made a significant contribution towards our national economic development We know that Investment Promotion Centre which is now two and a half years old was created by an Act of Parliament in nineteen ninety The main objectives of the IPC are to act as a focal point for the promotion co-ordination regulation and monitoring of local and foreign investments in Tanzania The Centre started functioning in September nineteen ninety when the President appointed the first Director General and it has been making  a> gradual progress in promoting foreign investment Although in the seminar you will be discussing the ways to promote further investment opportunities and the deployment of our own resources it is also important to focus on the historical background of our economic development We all know that after attaining independence our economic sector was  in private hands and mostly foreigners The state therefore took control of all major means of production after the launching of Arusha Declaration in nineteen sixty-seven The economic sector which was  in private hands was put under control of the state Our country also became a one-party state The major means of production which were nationalized after independence were as I said predominantly in foreign hands and they were geared towards the colonial interests The nationalization exercise therefore was aimed at directing the economic sector to serve the interests of the majority of Tanzanian population And this was a vital step implementing our policy of socialism and self-reliance Nationalization therefore enabled Tanzanian population to enjoy free social services Free education free medical services were provided by the state out of the nationalized economic sector Nationalization was therefore the only ideal way to distribute equitably the national cake among the majority of the poor  Tanzanian peasants Although the exercise was welcomed and supported by the majority of poor Tanzanians it was faced with problems After nationalization we experienced the problem of lack of expertise to manage the economic institutions Both managerial technical skills were lacking in most of the nationalized institutions Apart from this problem the sector was faced with the problem of capital investment The industries therefore produced below capacity due to lack of sufficient inputs power failure poor infrastructure mismanagement coupled with the embezzlements and sabotage This trend therefore led to the collapse of some of our parastatals Bora Shoe Company stands as a good example The economic performance under state control became worse in the late nineteen seventies because of the following factors There was severe drought which forced the government to spend the major foreign  reserves to import food instead of agricultural or industrial imports The collapse of East East AfricanRRR community forced the government to re-allocate the major resources to form our own organizations airways harbours railways post and telecommunications Another factor which contributed to the worse economic performance was the war with Idi Amin of Uganda The government had to deviate our national resources from economic ventures to finance the war which although we eventually won left the country in economic pledge The control of the economy by the state therefore did not accelerate the expected economic progress The economic performance remained poor And this in turn led to the poor services service provision in the social sector Unfortunately the private sector both indigenous and foreign which could have filled the gap had been largely discouraged to operate alongside with the public sector You may here recall that the Arusha Declaration had forbidden anybody aspiring to be a leader to own any economic venture however small it could have been This concept therefore led to the potential individuals to fail to contribute to the national economic growth Agricultural sector which was the backbone of our economy did not perform well because of various factors The majority of peasants could not improve and increase their agricultural output because of the high costs of imports and falling prices of the agricultural goods in the world market The farmers became victims because they were forced to accept the low prices for their coffee cotton sisal and other agricultural products Farmers unlike the industrial producers were not able to control the prices of the agricultural goods This means therefore that even their great agricultural sector performance was not very good for reasons explained This analysis therefore helps to explain why our economy remained  in a crisis in the late seventies and early eighties It was during this period when the government formulated the recovery policies like the National Economic Survival Programme and later the Structural Adjustment Programme Along with these programmes the government decided to liberalize trade People with foreign exchange were allowed to import goods to fill the shops which had gone empty for a considerable period people may recall when it was difficult to find any of essential goods  in the shops At times people had to do without the essential goods because they could not be found in shops Actually the good intention of state control of the economy had led the government to try to do everything for the people but it ended up doing very little or nothing at all The move towards trade liberalization therefore made the private sector to start contribute towards our economic recovery The shops which were virtually empty in the early nineteen eighties are now filled with various consumer and accessory goods Trade liberalization therefore became one of the major steps in our economic programme recovery programme The changes taking place now around the world have greatly influenced the changes to take place in most of the countries where state control of the economy was prevailing The socialist countries like China and Russia which had state controlled economies have greatly changed and now they have liberalized their economies China for example has changed it by creating suitable conditions for private sector to operate They have created economic zones which are provided with all necessary infrastructures to attract foreign investors This policy therefore has attracted investors from USA Japan and the other Western countries to invest in China Tanzania likewise has also to liberalize all spheres which were controlled by the state The private sector which was ignored after independence has it now has to be encouraged and protected Our government realizes that the political economic and the social environment are characterized by dynamism They have to keep on changing to accommodate the changing environment This explains why we have moved from one-party-system to multiparty-system and from state controlled economy to privatisation and from free social services to paid service provision In this era the ruling party CCM and the government therefore have resolved to resort to the traditional roles of the government of maintaining law and order and creating conducive climate for private investments and individual initiatives to operate smoothly We have now therefore be aware that the state now will no longer be involved in the economic ventures as it used to be in the past Although Tanzania is a poor country we should be proud that we managed throughout to maintain stability peace and security The changes taking place in the country therefore require peaceful and stable environment It is the duty of the government therefore to ensure that peace security in the country  are maintained at all costs We should learn from our brothers in Burundi Rwanda Angola Mozambique Somalia where civil wars have adversely affected their social and economic lives The instability prevailing in these countries have led to the indigenous and foreign and foreigners to flee from these countries This is indeed uh deplorable situation because most of the bloodshed taking place is caused by power struggle between personalities at the expense of the poor people We should therefore learn from these countries and assure that we do not fall into this trap Only military investors who will be willing to invest in places where there is war but but not the economic investors May I therefore call upon all Tanzanians who love to live in peace to co-operate with the government in ensuring that they will do not put our country into strife caused by religious tribal or any other differences We have been since since pre-independence days living like brothers and sisters irrespective of our tribal or religious differences The recent incidence of unrest caused by a group by groups of few fundamentalists under the pretext of religion should be condemned by all peace-loving Tanzanians and all foreigners who aspire to invest in Tanzania We should therefore consolidate our solidarity and co-operate together in assuring that we create an an atmosphere of stability and prosperity  in the interest of all Tanzanians and for foreign investors May I also point out that although we have allowed opposition parties to be formed and operate we should join together in creating favourable conditions to attract investors during this transitional period It is therefore very sad for some of the opposition parties to advocate for the elimination of groups of people who they call <ea/>gabacholis in favour of <ea/>walalahoi This is a wrong concept because it is misleading to assume that the poor Tanzanians will get rich by driving out the Indians Arabs and other foreigners living in Tanzania Let us learn from what took place in Uganda during Idi Amin's era The Indians were kicked out and the the indigenous people were handed over their business The  Ugandan economy did not improve neither were the majority of the Ugandans became rich The new regime has realized the mistake and now they have invited the Indians back to come and participate in building the  Ugandan economy Tanzania under CCM therefore will not support the idea of eliminating the the foreigners in favour of indigenous Tanzanians because it means discouraging foreign investors The government under the liberalization policy will go on encouraging both local and foreign investors to participate in the economic ventures We are aware that due to economic crisis the problem of uh unemployment has grown up We have a lot of youths migrating to urban areas and due to the to unemployment problems most of them have indulged themselves in crimes as a shortcut way of earning their living The government therefore has launched a special fund about one point eight million shillings to be loaned to this group to enable them to make their own small economic projects We also hope that under investment programme some of the youths will be absorbed in the new economic projects Although the government is withdrawing from running the economic activities we hope that the private sector will fully co-operate in building our economy We invite all genuine investors to come because the prevailing situation is right for serious and genuine investors The tax invaders and dubious people who come under cover of investment policy will not be entertained The government and my ministry in particular would like to assure genuine investors that they will be fully protected if on their part there will be they will observe laws and the regulations laid down The role of the government will largely remain of ensuring there is peace harmony and order in the country May I now take take this opportunity to urge the IPC to ensure that our open door policy is well translated and transmitted to the willing local and foreign investors I also call upon all Tanzanians to understand this policy so that they can participate positively particularly in buying shares in the collapsing parastatals We need to understand that investment policy apart from creating employment will also offer other opportunities like transfer of technology availability of essential consumer goods managerial skills capital formation effective infrastructure and growth of the economy in general It is the task of IPC therefore to ensure that the policy succeeds and that ultimately the Tanzanians are able to enjoy the results May I also call upon investors from the developed countries to make a deliberate move to invest largely in developing countries like Tanzania We have a lot of unexploited potentialities which have remained idle because of lack of capital investment The deliberate move therefore will help to break to bridge the widening gap between the rich and the poor nations The investment has to flow from the rich nations to the poor as a way of eliminating contradictions which may disturb  the> world peace We all love peace and prosperity therefore let us work together towards that end I hope that the participants will discuss seriously how we can promote and encourage accelerated investment in Tanzania Let me assure you that the government will be ready to support and assist the IPC endeavour We are anxiously waiting to learn the outcome of your seminar Once again I thank the Director General of IPC for inviting me to this seminar I also and also for the participants who have managed to attend and lastly for listening to me I now have much pleasure to declare this seminar open Thank you very much", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '9194f906-59d6-4afa-aeb6-b4224d0ff96c',

{'text': "Thank you chairperson Guests of honour Honourable Minister of State President's Office Civil Service <ea/>Ndugu Fatma Said Ali MP Director of Social Services Zanzibar Assistant Commissioner for Social Services Tanzania mainland Chairperson of EAFOD Secretary General of uh SAFORD Members or  Representatives of United Nation Agencies Guest of Honours  Distinguished Guests Ladies and Gentlemen I think before I make the closing or concluding statement I would like first to remind ourselves  as leaders and try to see who is a leader We are all leaders and we are all seated there as leaders So probably when I describe a leader you have the freedom to accept or to reject that First I say that a leader is lazy letting others in the group do the work Two the leader is crazy believing that others will do the work Third the leader is stupid attempting impossible tasks even after the final no A leader is ignorant always a student asking stupid questions eager to learn A leader is foolish working hard dedicated receiving little material reward A leader is brazen stepping forward when others shy away putting duty before career A leader is <_/impetus> daring to question the validity of the underlying assumptions of sacred cows as their relation to the past present and future A leader is powerless playing open-handed letting others know all the information at the leader's disposal in a manner useful to others A leader is *indisciplined> and individual in the absence of orders initiates and executes the right course of action A leader is incompetent seeking help when needed no matter what light it throws on the leader's competence in getting the job done And lastly a leader is weak letting those around be individuals by allowing them to have the *attributers> of a good leader So you have the freedom to accept to reject or whatever but I feel those are the  characteristics of a leader Honourable Minister ladies and gentlemen at this concluding ceremony of a training of trainers workshop and the second regional executive committee meeting of the Eastern African Federation of the Disabled that is EAFOD it gives me great pleasure to record with much appreciation the role all the participants played to bring all the business which started on Monday twenty-fourth January nineteen ninety-four to such a successful conclusion The deliberations of our workshop and indeed those of the region's executive committee meeting have opened a new chapter in the development of disabled people in the whole of eastern Africa The workshop came up with very interesting and practical  resolutions whose implementation by all parties concerned will definitely ensure a new life for disabled people a life which they have been denied for a long time in the region For decades eastern African countries have been undergoing all kinds of social economic political and in some cases religious problems and under such conditions and throughout these decades of turmoil disabled people have been suffering silently For those who have tried to cry out loudly their voices have not been heard by anybody Ours has been a voice in the wilderness Therefore through this EAFOD we now have a powerful and loud voice of disabled people in the part in this part of the world Through unity we are going to make that voice ever louder and stronger Our governments in the region need to receive and accept all the resolutions which were made by the workshop participants On behalf of all my colleagues in eastern Africa I would like to thank uh the government of Zanzibar and the government of Tanzania for all the support that have given us and to enable us successfully achieve the  objectives of this workshop I would also like to thank all the participants and the EAFOD leadership for a job well done Thanks also too for choosing Zanzibar to be the interim headquarters of the Eastern African Federation of the Disabled I would like to assure all of you that as Secretary General of EAFOD I will do my best to keep all our progresses properly co-ordinated and this of course will be done with the co-operation of all executive members of EAFOD and grass-root member organisations that belong to Eastern Africa With this short conclusive remark honourable guest of honour on behalf of EAFOD and on behalf of the participants of the workshop I would like to read to you and to all those present the resolutions that were adopted uh at the workshop These resolutions are supposed not to be uh papers to be filed in the files but these are going to be papers that have to be you know to be implemented for the benefit and development of disabled people in the region So these are the resolutions which are adopted Preamble This first Eastern African Federation of the Disabled meeting of training of trainers workshop which brought together thirty delegates from eleven EAFOD member countries to discuss and get practical solutions of acquiring knowledge and implementing such knowledge to empower and enable their constituencies in their respective countries in order for them to be able to redress all the past imbalances which societies and governments have created for them Realising the past and present negative attitudes that have resulted from discriminatory barriers degrading exploitating cruel and unjust treatment committed against people with disabilities which in turn has been a denial of human basic rights by their governments  at different levels Reaffirming our rights to fundamental life liberty equality security and all other rights belonging to mankind irrespective of their social status religious disability gender or other considerations Aware of the discrimination unfair treatment and exploitation to which people with disabilities have been and continue to be subjected in all areas of social political and economic life and participation as well as their marginalisation degradation and abuse of women and children Reaffirming again the need to involve people's disabilities and their organisations in all matters affecting them especially at decision making and policy formulation levels national planning and social reconstruction on matters affecting disabled persons We therefore would like to part to put forward the following resolutions and uh put to the government of the east African region and uh to the following demands with urgency they *they> deserve One EAFOD should take a long road to ensure equal and full participation of women with disabilities in all its structures which will eventually permeate their total involvement and participation at local national and regional  levels Mindful that in some countries in the region women including women with disabilities have no right to inheritance EAFOD has resolved to fight for this evil practice to be abolished be it set up it's  backed by legislative or traditional law Two EAFOD should fight with their respective governments in the region for their rights to education health employment housing transport information etcetera Number three United Nations and its agencies should unreservedly condemn and isolate regimes which allow the violation of the rights of disabled people such as dragging disabled people from villages to urban centres to turn them into clubs of beggars for the benefit of those perpetrating the *violators> At the same time the United Nations and its agencies and governments should take every necessary step to ensure that child labour which has been on the increase in recent years is pulled to a halt Four Governments in eastern Africa in consultation with national associations of the deaf should accept and develop sign language as an official language of deaf persons Five Governments in eastern Africa should take it as their obligation toward ensuring that people with disabilities are provided with free and appropriate assisted devices for  the> independent living Six Having disagreed with WHO definition of CBR CBR means Community Based Rehabilitation which is <O/> the participants emphasised the need for DPI and its structure to redefine the present CBR concept so that its components embody total development of disabled people their full participation and rehabilitation of the community Seven EAFOD should take every necessary step to run their day to day activities democratically Those with experience should impart knowledge to the young and emerging leaders as well as avoid dictatorial tendencies of having lifetime leaders Eight EAFOD should strive for total unity of disability groups and the organisation of eastern Africa through exchange of information and visits training programme sharing of resources and promoting marketing of products produced by the disabled people Nine EAFOD should strive for increased development of eastern Africa and southern African co-operation in all fields of development as a step towards the formation of a Pan African Federation of the Disabled Ten which is the last but not least resolution EAFOD should through its national governments and authorities in the region formulate and enforce comprehensive legislation to promote and protect the rights and interests of disabled persons and thereby ensure disabled persons of access to all community services These are the ten point recommendations or resolutions rather which were adopted by the uh participants of the workshop and uh these of course are going to be distributed to all governments of the region and then we'll have to make a follow-up to see that these resolutions don't end up in dustbins as it happened in some countries where the world programme of action concerning disabled persons was put in the dustbin up to the mid-term evaluation when other governments were not even aware that that United Nations document was available So with these few remarks honourable guests uh I would like to welcome the director of uh social welfare Zanzibar to", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '4cdb9f36-a85b-4cf7-b96f-a34b0662d808', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.200633+00:00',

{'text': "Your Excellencies ambassadors and heads of foreign missions distinguished representatives of international organisations esteemed workshop participants invited guests ladies and gentlemen it gives me great pleasure to have been invited to officiate the opening of this important meeting I wish to commend the commission for land and environment of the ministry of water construction energy land and environment together with the commission for tourism of the ministry of information culture tourism and youth for organising this very important workshop I also wish to convey my special thanks to the Royal <O/> Netherlands embassy in Nairobi the Finnish International Development Agency and the Global Environment Facility Programme in Tanzania for their great assistance in convening this meeting which is a follow-up to the Zanzibar National Environment policy <O/> workshop held in July nineteen ninety-four On behalf of the government and the people of Tanzania and of Zanzibar in particular and on my own behalf I take this opportunity to welcome you all It is my hope however that you will be able yet to perceive a tinge of warmth and cordiality from amongst the citizens during your stay here and please do feel at home Mr Chairman I don't need to stress the urgency of this workshop at this stage of Zanzibar's tourism development since tourism is now the world the world's fastest growing industry and according to the nineteen ninety-two report of the World Travel and Tourism Council between nineteen seventy and nineteen ninety the number of tourists travelling in the world grew by nearly three hundred per cent It is expected to grow by half again before the turn of the century Tourism is now in the  throes of being regarded as one of the world's largest industries employing about one hundred and twelve million people world-wide and paying about US dollars five hundred and forty thousand million in wages and salaries It is <O/> that the tourism industry will be responsible for for seven per cent of total capital investment in nineteen ninety-five The fastest growth is being witnessed in travel to new destinations and in so-called ecotourism the <O_><O/>of environmental issues in important tourist markets of the developed countries Mr Chairman Zanzibar tourism development during its infancy stage is a mere abstraction of no exception to the global situation due to what is reported above The very trust to economic organisation made by the Zanzibar government over the past ten years is an attempt to diversify <O_><O/> of isles away from the from its earlier dependence on the mono-<O/> economy The tourism industry has assumed a broader capacity in Zanzibar's national economic development plan Zanzibar is widely recognised as having foreseen the opportunity for tourism development and it has foreseen that the tourism industry will soon become a major source of employment as well as a natural earner of both local revenue and foreign exchange By the year two thousand it is planned to be not less than six thousand hotel beds in operation in <O_><O/> So far just one thousand two hundred beds are in operation though currently a further one thousand five hundred beds are under construction around the coast of Unguja The message in Pemba is far less advanced now with just three government hotels and three guest houses serving the whole islands It may perhaps be important to inform the western delegates that Pemba has more attractive scenery interrupted by gentle views all through with more beautiful beaches than the island of Zanzibar It has more rainfall which means all the more greening lasts throughout the year My pen I'm afraid cannot give a better description than a sight-seeing The <O/> is very much aware that uncertainty of water and power is a major obstacle to serious investment in Pemba Conversely employment will continue to be even more a problem and it is our intention and the government it is trying her best to make sure that those two monstrous hindrances are solved as soon as time could allow Esteemed delegates it may be good to mention that other segments of the tourism industry are also developing to keep pace with the increase of tourists arrivals which have risen by twenty per cent per year since nineteen eighty-five This is about uh sixty-four thousand tourists in nineteen ninety-two Recently fifteen of Zanzibar's leading tour operators formed themselves into a uh an organisation called ZATO the Zanzibar Association of Tour Operators which was registered in nineteen ninety-three Several registered dive and marine sports operators have also started to emerge The UNDP's operated hotel management school at Manihubi is in the second year of operation with a capacity of seventy-two students Mr Chairman as partly concern amounts over the growing threat of the global environment and attention focuses on the need to manage the major resources more sustainably the human community has now to assume a more conscious attitude and the operations of the world's major industries must now come under increasing scrutiny It is important therefore to bring tourism as one tool in global and growing industry within the general debate for sustainable development It is the intention of the Zanzibar government to develop a high class environmentally environmentally sensitive tourism industry that brings benefit thus to the national economy and to the local areas in which tourists tourist activities are concentrated and which contribute to the protection of Zanzibar's national heritage culture and environment The government has every intention to improve and preserve the pearl of this history being the Zanzibar Old Stone Town with all the urge to restore the life of all the palaces and castles in both Zanzibar and Pemba The old mosques and the archaeological findings will all be put into view Very rare species of flora and fauna will be nurtured with maximum care for the tourists and  the> posterity Perhaps the charm and friendliness of the people they do take part may add a great deal to oncoming cordiality of the islands of Zanzibar Mr Chairman allow me to take this opportunity to assure members of this gathering and through them the public that those fears which germinated from religious enthusiasm over the question of tourism had not that effect nor bearing to the teaching of Koran nor the directives of Prophet Mohammed We know for sure that they have nothing other than political motives These granted political demagogues sometimes find it easier to pass through the avenue of religion in order to arrive at their political heaven Islam's Islamic scholars have proved beyond all doubt that Koran makes very clear and clean mention about tourism Walk on the land and see Whether <O/> or from God it is my hope that all of us shall co-operate together towards achieving this objective and that the <O/> of Zanzibar's culture shall forever remain a centre of tourist attraction It may again be rightly speaking that uh the Zanzibar government is now in the process of producing plans for the for the establishment and management of nature conservation areas These have the potential to channel money from the tourism industry <O/> into the conservation of some of Zanzibar's richest and most important natural ecosystems Such areas however need to be well managed taking into account the main local communities who are the traditional users of areas and <O/> as well as the requirement of conservation in tourism Mr Chairman what has been obtained most <O/> on tourism in the developing world is the interest of the industry <O_><O/> to the local culture While it is not easy to deny the fact it would be wrong to magnify it beyond proportion Tourism planning is certainly the essential criterion that will be used to safeguard the purpose It is my belief is my beliefRRR that the areas of such destructive influence must be borne in mind by both the tourists the tourist and the citizen for it is through their amicable and mutual co-operation that the industry can survive Mr Chairman it is needless to reiterate  to> the theme of the workshop which is ecotourism and environment Ecotourism and environment cannot be singled out as an agenda for one country since the earth is a aRRR <O/> village for all of us It is interrelated among countries and nations in and among species of all denominations We have to work together towards a common goal by arousing the consciousness of the sustainable growth sustainable economy and sustainable development The present generation may be doing a great disservice to itself and to their  offspring unborn if it shall not be if it shall not be careful enough to the assessment of their own values In the tropical rain forests about seventeen million hectares of trees are being cleared away every year or around fifty thousand hectares per day Under those circumstances man through his through his urge for a better life can be the most destructive animal under the sun About the close of this century the relationship between the human world and the place that sustains it has undergone a profound change When the century began neither human members nor <O_><O/> had the power radically to alter <O/> system As the century closes the total of vastly increased human numbers and the activities have that power but major unintended changes are occurring in the atmosphere in cells in waters and in plants and animals and in the relations in the relationships among all of these The rate of change is outstripping the ability of scientific discipline in our current ability to assess and advance It is frustrating the attempts of medical and economic situations which evolved in a different more fragmented world to adapt and cope It deeply worries many people who are seeking ways to place their concerns on the political agendas The mental degradation first seen as mainly a problem of the rich nations in a search of it  for a better life has become a survival issue for developing nations It is part of the downwards downward spiral of linked ecological and economical decline in which many of the poorest nations are trapped Despite official hope expressed on all sides no change identifiable today no programmes or policies offer any real hope of narrowing the growing gap between rich and poor nations At the start of our development <O_><O/> the path that this nation has followed for millions of years in the creating a planet our ancestors would want to recognise Humanity has the ability has the abilityRRR to make development sustainable to ensure that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs The concept of sustainable development does imply limits not also limits but limitations imposed by the present state of technology on social organisation and environmental resources and by the ability of the biosphere to absorb the <O/> of human activities but technology and social organisation can be both managed and improved to make way for a new era of economic growth Lastly Mr Chairman ecotourism and environment must be handled at one and the same time through concerted efforts that embody the co-operation of all states and governments in the <O/> of individuals The government of Zanzibar will do all she can to educate herself and her people towards the need for more understanding of the intricacies and applications of these two topics\nWe ask you all ladies and gentlemen to feel all too free to air your views and suggestions for the benefit of the people of Zanzibar and beyond And in conclusion Mr Chairman I wish you every success in reporting a task ahead and take the opportunity now to declare this workshop on ecotourism and environment open I thank you very much", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "Chairperson uh Assistant Commissioner for Social Welfare Tanzania mainland Director for Social Welfare Tanzania island the UNDP representative the representative of EAFOD uh let's not forget the manager for Bwawani Hotel here workshop participants invited guests ladies and gentlemen first of all I would like to thank you most sincerely for the great honour and privilege you have given me to close this seminar The holding of this seminar in Zanzibar is a great honour to Tanzania for which we Tanzanians are very grateful I would like to take this opportunity on my behalf and on behalf of the government of Tanzania as well to thank all the distinguished guests and seminar participants for your kind participation in this programme I hope that your brief stay in Zanzibar has been both fruitful and enjoyable and especially because you are  on an island of perfume Zanzibar is renowned for its unrivalled perfumes from Pemba and also for its people's hospitality I trust you that you have enjoyed the fascinating scent of the Zanzibar perfume Chairperson I wish to extend my special  gratitude to delegates representatives of EAFOD Your attendance at this workshop has enabled it to be a success and it is an inspiration to the people of eastern Africa who are struggling to achieve social economic and political liberation through co-ordination and co-operation among themselves Chairperson I have been informed that you have been here for one week deliberating on issues concerning disabled persons in our region and that you did visit around the island I believe this exercise has enriched your vision on your duties lying ahead of you With the exchange of experience you have had I'm sure your tasks will not be difficult It can be done so play your part Chairperson again on my behalf and on behalf of the government of Tanzania I wish to congratulate you for the formation of  a> regional co-operation You have taken the right channel to form the Eastern African Federation of the Disabled which is the right tool in the struggle for your rights Chairperson your federation has been wise to see the need for the training of trainers Training enables people to do their jobs in a systematic manner and having identified their skill gaps as regards knowledge skill and attitudes as you have said yourself in the resolution now they need special attention Some societies had disregarded them some time ago and some still segregate them Chairperson I'm glad to say that our country Tanzania is aware of the problems facing this group of persons We have been trying our best to integrate them in all our social and economic development activities according to our economic ability During the fiscal year of nineteen ninety-two nineteen ninety-three about two hundred and twenty-two disabled people attended courses in different special training institutions for disabled They were trained in agriculture animal husbandry crafts-making electronics carpentry etcetera Chairperson I'm glad to mention that Tanzania is also ahead in caring for its disadvantaged people as follows About seventy-three people I mean disabled people were employed Two hundred and fifty-six were assisted self-employment Four uh about them were given motorbikes Fifty were given three-wheeled bikes Fifty-one were given artificial legs or arms shoes and guidesticks Two hundred disabled in Iringa village were given loans to the tune of seventeen uh million to enable them start small  businesses under the Community Based Rehabilitation Plan Our projected plan for nineteen ninety-three nineteen ninety-four is to train about one seventy-nine disabled people Fifty are to be trained on in vocational training centres and other trade schools All this will be done in collaboration with UNDP ILO SHIA and all who intend to raise a revolving fund for the disabled for for setting up small business projects to assist them under the Community Based Rehabilitation Scheme Chairperson I have only been trying to show how Tanzania our country is striving to assist and accommodate the disabled person Much of this data is based on Tanzanian mainland experience but also in Zanzibar here I was also told that the government has tried its best It gave them an office so that they make it as  headquarters It also gave them one flat so that they can rent and get money so that they can generate funds for themselves and uh most of their let us say seminars sometimes they get some funds from the government so it shows both Tanzania mainland and Tanzania island are taking care of our disabled people So I believe all our countries will do the same Chairperson another area which requires extra effort from all areas especially among the disabled  persons themselves is that of social equity Everywhere we have of late heard of social equity which advocates equitable distribution of benefits in development throughout the society However people in the rural areas and the disabled persons rarely benefit This has to be rectified and those who are supposed to advocate for this change are the disabled persons yourselves Chairperson here I need also to mention the plight of the disabled women Women in general have struggled very hard to be where they are now and they still struggle to get their rights and recognition I've no doubt disabled women in our societies are more disadvantaged than their male counterparts Many of them are left behind and they are not given the chance to participate in decision-making and taking other leadership roles Disabled women are denied the basic human rights of education training economic independence and participation in society compared to their fellow disabled men Social cultural attitudinal and structural barriers play a significant role in undermining the women's development I'm sure you have a different attitude I have I have been told that in the federation executive committee there is a gender balance I've also been informed that Disabled Peoples International of which you are a part of has a solid stand to see to it that in all its governing councils and representations right from the grassroot level there is an equal representation between male and female gender This is very encouraging and I congratulate these bodies for realising this deficiency Chairperson during your <O/> meeting with the  participants here you have exchanged a lot of information and some of you have developed that important human link of friendship But friendship gets its test of being honest and genuine relationship when those who regard themselves are far apart This is the right occasion to prove that the friendship you have cultivated is an honest one Dear participants this can be done by promoting an exchange of information If one of your national  association><+_ associations> has found a way to cope with a particular problem this information may be of great use to people in other member countries of the federation Chairperson and dear participants before I conclude I would like to offer on behalf of the government of Tanzania our gratitude to the local organising committee under the leadership of Mr Khalfan Hemed Khalfan for his tireless effort which has made this gathering a success I also extend my thanks to those who supported the workshop in one way or the other Also this my gratitude has to go to the United Nations Disability Unit New York the Netherlands Organisation for International Development Co-operation the Commonwealth Foundation and the Royal Danish Embassy in Tanzania who have generously financed this training programme I also extend my thanks to <./nat> to the national institution and business community for their contribution Chairperson dear participants I wish you all a

{'text': "Mr Chairman of uh TAPO <name/> members of TAPO distinguished participants ladies and gentlemen it is an honour for me to officiate the official opening of this annual symposium of the Tanzania Association of Parastatal Organisations After receiving your invitation I've taken some trouble to learn about TAPO and its activities I must say that I am impressed by TAPO's forward-looking traditions and its readiness to traverse areas of controversy but uh of significance to the parastatals and to our economy yes even to our body politic How fortunate Mr Chairman we all are that our parastatals in Tanzania have TAPO to bring them together in a in a common forum More important how fortunate we have we are to have an organisation that is ready to look into the future to prepare for it and indeed to influence it I want to commend TAPO and its leadership its membership for achieving these perspectives <ea/>bongesi Mr Chairman statistics show that the Tanzania parastatal Tanzania parastatalRRR cannot be ignored in planning our economy The parastatal sector has the capacity to contribute significantly to the economic well-being of our country Unfortunately it also has a capacity to drag the economy of our country backwards and thus harming the aspirations of our people Mr Chairman there is evidence that the parastatal sector can exhibit a great deal of creativity efficiency and a sense of accountability Unfortunately there is also evidence of some parastatals that are the sick creatures of our economy and the worst examples of lack of imagination inefficiency and irresponsibility This is the parastatal predicament This is what makes the behaviour of the parastatal sector so unpredictable Mr Chairman consider the following phenomena In nineteen eighty-five a hundred and thirty-eight parastatals had their accounts unaudited What a situation In nineteen eighty-nine parastatals in this category were reduced to eighty-five from hundred and thirty-eight This is quite an achievement but certainly not a complete achievement Nineteen eighty-five in nineteen eighty-five thirty-seven point uh one per cent of parastatals received clean certificates from the auditors In nineteen eighty-nine this figure jumped to  ninety fifty-one point one per cent This shows a capacity by the parastatals to improve significantly their handling of accounts In the view of the topic chosen for this year's uh uh for this year'sRRR TAPO's symposium we should note the importance of proper bookkeeping and financial management and discipline that a parastatal ought to have if it is to be commercially viable On the whole we have cause for hope Reading through the reports of the Tanzania Audit Corporation the number of uh number ofRRR uh uh certified uh of clean certificates number of clean certificatesRRR were reduced dramatically No the number of no-opinion certificates were reduced dramatically from sixty-five to three in the period nineteen eighty-five to nineteen eighty-nine and partially clean certificates uh dropped from hundred and fifty-nine to forty-one during the same period Mr Chairman I repeat Tanzania cannot afford to ignore the state of the parastatal sector As for the party and the government the parastatal sector will continue to be important because of its double-track impact Uh consider the revenue enjoyed by the government through taxation In nineteen eighty-seven eighty-eight parastatals contributed shillings four point nine billion to treasury In nineteen eighty-nine ninety the treasury enjoyed a revenue of uh shillings ten point five billion On the other hand losses in the parastatal sector rose from shillings uh two billion point eight uh in nineteen eighty-five to shillings twenty-nine billion point one in nineteen eighty-nine The National Milling Corporation alone is said to have cost the government treasury about uh eight billion shillings during its lifetime Let me make a political statement about this predicament of the status of the parastatal sector in our economy The party will not be so foolish as to ignore the positive aspects of our parastatals in terms of their contribution to investment mobilization growth of national productive capacity supply of essential goods and services availability of employment Nor will the party ever ignore the parastatal role in providing the necessary competition to the firms in the private the privateRRR sector and to balancing the ethnic question of ownership of means of production and distribution in our country Mr Chairman on the other hand CCM and its government can no longer hesitate to take the necessary measures to counter the negative economic manifestations in our parastatals such as perpetual losses in some of them disorganized management systems and dependence on  the> government money or bank loans that are not paid Mr Chairman today in this symposium of  Tanzanian Association of Parastatal Organisation you are discussing commercialization of the parastatals in Tanzania Let me quickly agree that that is indeed what is happening in Tanzania I believe that the intensity towards such commercialization will grow and not lessen at all that the insensitivity towards such commercialization will grow and will not lessen at all There is no future in Tanzania for economic parastatals which cannot stand on their own but are perpetually bailed out by the taxpayers through subsidies from the government treasury I cannot see any future for training parastatals which cannot or will not make profits from their operations Mr Chairman such parastatals are doomed Yes Mr Chairman and members of TAPO our parastatals must go commercial and must make profits It is clear that the people of Tanzania have exhausted their patience with respect to parastatals which believe that they have a right to exist even if they are not earning that right or are not even trying to earn it I believe ideology alone is no longer a <O/> alibi for loss-making parastatals to shield in The party and the government I believe that the people as well are now no under no illusion that loss-making and subsidy dependent parastatals are a liability and not an asset to our efforts for economic recovery Such parastatals are a discredit not a credit to the policy of socialism and self-reliance Tanzania is going through a sea change right now uh not unlike that which is occurring in the world around us The sea change will demand political reforms but also particular changes in economic perceptions prospectives and values In this situation men of and women I must say men and women I wrote men here men and women of old ideas and views will be seen as archaic and as an obstacle to advancement of our nation and its economy They will and I think they are being discarded In economics and business Tanzania has already reached a stage of giving great appreciation to results on the welfare of the people and not just to forms of ownership of an enterprise Appreciation will go to the enterprise that delivers at least cost delivers at least costRRR and with efficiency regardless of whether it is a public or a private institution of an an<_/> enterprise I believe Mr Chairman that time has arrived and ought to arrive the time for giving the parastatal monopoly status is gone The time for allowing competition on serving the public has come The time for tolerating a sluggish management in the parastatals that cannot seize investment opportunities that cannot cut costs even when opportunities exist that cannot compete in the marketing functions that cannot motivate its labour that will not make necessary but difficult decisions the time for such management in Tanzania is gone Are these policies and views uh Mr Chairman some of you might be wondering are these policies and views mine or are they part of the official party and government policy They are implied in the decisions of the party to promote equally both the public and private investment through the investment code They are implied in the liberalisation of external and internal trade They are implied in the decisions of the <name/> commission report with its emphasis on opening up to the public purchase of shares stocks and ventures including those in the banking sectors These positions are already being implemented in the decision to ask loss-making parastatals to seek salvation not from the Treasury but from the private investors through such schemes as joint ventures uh partnerships and indeed privatization Mr Chairman let me tell you my friends from the parastatal sectors those who have eyes to see would have III see already seen those with ears to hear will have heard and those with audacity to seize new  opportunities will see the situation as not threatening but definitely challenging Let me say that the drive for commercialization of our parastatals must be accompanied by measures that enable parastatals to play this role You have yourself mentioned some of them These policy and practical measures must include a real granting of autonomy to parastatal enterprises and companies It is vital that most decisions that affect their performance and discretion must be restored to the management and boards of directors of the parastatals themselves These should include decisions on employees' morale and motivation quality quantity and prices of goods and services produced financial decisions etcetera Such types of decision must no longer reside outside the parastatals I hope our friends from uh uh <name/> are not too worried about this statement I also believe that in certain cases especially where there is  a> stiff competition from external producers government should review taxation policies including level of sales tax for home-produced goods and of customs duties for imported goods All these measures should create the right environment for parastatals to apply themselves with full vigour on the basis of normal commercial principles and practices There may be these and other measures which are necessary to make a success of privatisation of the the<_/> parastatal sector <ea/>Ndugu Chairman gentlemen and ladies from the parastatal sector don't wait for somebody to point such policies and decisions which you need You must do it yourselves and in a forum like this one there is an opportunity for enlightening the party and for enlightening the government Mr Chairman ladies and gentlemen thank you for according me this honour I now declare the TAPO annual symposium of nineteen ninety-one

{'text': "I would like to thank the minister very much for his contribution of these personal views about multipartism because I believe he did not speak as a minister but as a human being who is free to contribute his ideas in a free country I agree with him .\nI'm Pastor Christopher Mtikila uh uh I agree with both the two previous speakers to a large extent except where it touches on the feasibility of multipartism in Tanzania Maybe to be more precise and to be better understood I should define what is the meaning of human rights of civil rights of democracy and a political party I understand human rights to be the rights of human beings be them blue green or white wherever they are provided they have not resigned from humanity to become other things Then there <O/> a separate entitlement to those rights Civil rights is what we were fighting for under the umbrella of TANU way back in the late fifties and achieved them I think on the ninth December sixty-one or sixty-two I don't know what we got in each in both the years but the two years consolidated our entitlement to civil rights And what TANU was actually fighting for was not good roads was not bread butter and cheese I think we had plenty from England those days and very cheaply It was nothing It was only the human right to participation one's participation in his own country and we said we were by then nine and a half million people so all of us were human beings So each one of the nine and a half human beings had entitlement to that civil right Anyway a few breaths away uh a smaller group from the nine and a half million people grabbed that right from the rest of the people That's what I understand I always have difficulty  in merging reality and diplomacy when I deliver my speeches You can do it to suit your own understanding anyway Now democracy there people talk about multiparty democracy and one party democracy But I read English I think as much as you did I want to think that democracy is the right to freedom of opinion and the right to freedom of expression of that opinion and the right to freedom of participation in the ruling in the governing in the running of one's own country through that freely opted-for opinion So when we talk about a democratic country we talk about a climate a political climate where we have got so many freely opted-for opinions So here it is important to know what a political party is then A political party is supposed to be one such opinion one political party is one such opinion which is shared by a group of individuals of a particular country who commit themselves fully to that opinion making an identity between that opinion and their own virtues It is an entitlement So I would oppose anybody who would say for the shortcomings economically and socially in our country we do away with the party which is responsible for this It would be very sinful because they have their entitlement They must be there and I was sent to defend them and join them if they change But that would not give me entitlement to grab other people's similar right because after all our banner is human equality So when we talk about multipartism we should be careful about bringing in the word feasibility In the sixties we had a bitter war which we fought using the United Nations and so many international fora We were trying to convince people in the west to reason with us that we are as equal human beings as they are We were rejecting their suggestions that we were uncivilised we were a cursed race even when they tried to equate us intelligently and diplomatically to monkeys We resisted it in the strongest terms until they came to agree with us that we were on equal status So those people are human beings and they decided to agree also that we were also human beings So the united the Universal Declaration of Human Rights under articles nineteen twenty-one twenty-three sections one to three and twenty-five section one which describe which enshrine the sacred human rights of every human being wherever he is and to which our system here is signatory forces those people to help us remember that we agreed we are going to be as equal human beings as them Now since they observe human rights in their homes in Europe and America etcetera etcetera we should do the same here So if we turn to them and say we understand that we fought for this equality very much but as for human rights we shall have to think about it if is feasible in our country because we don't have only human beings we also have got other things other than human beings Is that to say so We cannot talk about economy we cannot talk about social uh eventualities and justify them to deny us the rights civil rights in the country or human rights We cannot talk about events in other countries which led to their search for human rights in their own countries because we have entitlement here whether or not there are changes in Europe or in Eastern Europe It is an entitlement be ourselves be us educated or not we need to feel part of the population of this country So if it is a human right for any human being wherever he is in his or his orRRR her own country to have a share in the governing of that country of being elected to government or electing then if I'm denied here automatically and straight away without any compromise I'm being denied ingredients of my humanity which I probably should seek elsewhere I don't know whether I should cross borders and go and seek my human rights in other people's countries So I appreciate all the changes taking place elsewhere in the world even in South Africa for that matter where we have been I think in the forefront fighting apartheid because we are not racists we say because the majority were denied civil rights in their own country They had more bread more butter better houses better education better everything but they felt more comfortable when they came here as refugees because they found us enjoying civil rights which they are denied in their home at their home Whether they were denied the rights because of pigment or not I remember our country has always supported people who were denied such rights by the people of their own pigments in their own countries So I would say there is a another version of apartheid in other countries that apartheid is of a group of stronger people who grab all the power from their fellow citizens like our system here that is black to black apartheid So what we are doing now is we should not debate on whether human rights would be good for those who have been politically deprived People are misunderstanding us and I'm misunderstanding myself and even those the integrity of those people who say so I freely say and that uh I cannot lose touch with reality And even the commission I thank the first speaker and our chairman He's praised it very much and has told told us the sense of the commission being there I totally disagree with the idea of forming that commission if it's for looking for views as to whether human right would be good suitable for the human beings of Tanzania because that would justify what the western has used to say that we are a barbaric race etcetera etcetera Today we have lost the privilege of defending ourselves by forming such commissions But if it were a commission to go and prepare and look out how we shall reinstitute human rights in our country I would write an application to the chairman of CCM to be included in that commission So we should not go away we should not mention any other thing Even thieves and murders if they are they have nation if they have got citizenship anywhere they are they are entitled to civil rights Their crimes are very very different they cannot sabotage their rights they cannot take them away They have also got their civil rights to imprisonment if they fall criminal But we are not going to deny them That is the most important thing we should talk about The second speaker mentioned about the Zanzibar revolution Maybe that was very good because it helped me explain a little about the democracy that we have and the need for multipartism in our country The problem is not that people did not think about their rights their civil rights in this country They have always been knowing that they have the right and our constitution also states very clearly that we have got these political rights to multipartism There are so many contradictions in our constitution and there are people who try to walk in that constitution to to demand their civil rights We know what happened to them They were tortured victimised and imprisoned etcetera etcetera until one man outside the constitution said that we can now debate the human rights He is not sure whether we are really human beings to deserve human rights So that convinces me to believe that a monoparty state a monoparty a supreme party is a personal property because the man at the top can never be opposed The <name/> party in Iraq can never oppose Mr Saddam Hussein and so many other examples So with our union it is very difficult I think what we should be discussing is how we should amend innovate our constitution to be suitable to suit the changes which we desire because with a union I doubt very much if the commission would even come out with anything because the parliament in parliament one a uh sixty thousand Zanzibaris islanders are represented by one man So all of the people in the islands are represented If we take the same ratio to the mainland we find that in a population of twenty-four million only twenty-three million and four hundred thousand are represented in parliament If we take we transfer that under the umbrella in the principle of equality the same representation in Zanzibar we take it to the mainland so we see even there the democracy is so loose I'd not see it because we take sixty thousand people of mainland Tanzania and pick a representative for them So we shall have all of them representing only six hundred thousand like the Zanzibaris So all others are unrepresented There are all these things and we talk about national consensus on in all our national uh decisions I would not remember to have had one national consensus for the union anyway because I remember the former president said that what we are going to discuss about is not the question whether we need one party or many parties but how we are going to institute a one-party system \nSo there was no consensus national consensus there That's what he said He said we are not going to discuss about whether multi-partism is good or monopartism no We are only going to discuss about how to institute a one-party system National consensus is out there Even the union as actually for the union I've got a very very funny idea about it all\nYaah actually I have almost finished what I wanted to say only that on the question of the union again there was no national consensus It was something that was done single-handedly by one person although he had some good reasons to assign to his decision which does not uh tally with democracy anyway so multipartism is true democracy because it represents the ideas and the thinking of all other people such that even economically and socially we had antagonised the ideas some very positive ideas of people because they thought outside the framework of the one party so we threw away what they had to offer to this country because they should offer it under an a political umbrella of a party So the country's fallen casualty to all the  predicaments that every one understands So human rights civil rights and democracy and the meaning of a political party should guide us in thinking about whether the commissions are right or not and whether we should have any debate on human rights at all because we'd be resigning from humanity if we do so", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "For a number of reasons I decided to restructure my paper Although the title is the same It's on recent land changes in land tenure and its implication in the livelihood communities in the drylands of Tanzania Now there is a myth in Tanzania that land is so abundant uh that uh we don't have to worry and yet there are tenural shortages and these tenural shortages is especially acute in the areas of the dryland mainly because of the of theRRR conflicts between the appropriate type of conventional theories regarding dryland use and two because of the social dimensions of the problems of livelihood of pastoralists and agro-pastoralists The importance of land even to people in the drylands cannot be exaggerated because land gave people identity it gave them their basic resource uh and above all it was a method of both livelihood and survival of the community In terms of the land use I think the nineteen twenty-three uh land ordinance of Tanzania was extremely important because it introduced a duality system uh of tenure in which there was a deemed right versus the title rights And what is interesting is that this duality moved at Independence and it is now being tried to be justified under the liberalisation uh model that Tanzania is trying to adapt or adopt Now putting changes in land tenure in context in the socio-political changes that have taken place in the country I think are extremely important and it is in here that one of the reasons why I'm particularly interested in this is that the country as a whole is more agrarian based rather than pastorally based The arid lands The climatic boundaries define where it is roughly an area of uh between six hundred and eight hundred millimetres of rainfall where permanent agriculture is not possible and there are various uh figures given as to how big this area is the semi-arid is The figure varies from between twenty-five to seventy-five per cent of the country and between thirty-five and seventy-five per cent of the country Those are two extremes really If you notice the figure of seventy-five per cent that does not occur all the time and so I think critical are the twenty-five and thirty-five per cent of the country Roughly speaking this is in the centre of the country To me the heartland of the dry areas are that boundary there but when we talk about seventy-five per cent it could be once in every five or seven years or eleven years depending uh you'll find that the boundary extends to this other extreme giving us our seventy-five per cent Now most people regard the drylands as homogeneous The fact of the matter is that none of this thing none of the drylands are really homogeneous and it is in here that for example we'll find juxtapositions between pastoralists you have people practising irrigation And yet the general practices in the country particularly uh with the abolishment of the uh uh customary rights these things uh are completely distorted to give an impression that we're dealing with a homogeneous system Changes which occurred in the tenural system I think uh are at present moment under great uh they are under great uh uh pressure to conform African governments both and the people are  under enormous pressure to conform to western norms and number one to remain as primary producers and two to extend into non-traditional exports for example flowers vegetables citrus etcetera which tend to move into the semi-arid areas and into the arid areas And lastly you've got to look at these changes in terms of progression growth and settlement We are not only dealing with numbers but access to basic rights In the drylands it's not only land alone but I'll argue that it is a cluster of resources that uh we've got to be concerned with which once again tenure does not look at uh adequately For example in the semi-arid areas and arid areas land water pasture cattle all go together In fact you can have ownership of uh cattle not only  by individuals but also  by the whole society There has also been concern about the marginality of improvement to the productivity of both agriculturalists as well as among the pastoralists the interventions for example have led to further scarcities These scarcities have occurred both naturally as well as because of societal pressure For example if we look at land in Tanzania although they say a lot of it is available by nineteen forty-eight per capita the distribution was roughly eleven point eight hectares By nineteen eighty-eight it's down to three point nine And not only that but we'll find that one of the main pressures in fact on the land use because of state ownership is that twenty-five per cent of the country is either in terms of national parks game reserves and an increasing amount under urban areas uh Thirdly there's this conflict between game-controlled areas national parks uh for example in the Maasai area out of the total uh area of sixty-three thousand square kilometres by nineteen forties only twenty-seven thousand  were left to the Maasai and today even that twenty-seven per cent uh sorry twenty-seven thousand square kilometres  are under dispute If you look at this thing a bit more closely in terms of the uh what is available for people you get this picture uh The purple border there is supposed to be the semi-arid area almost a half of the semi-arid areas and look at the amount of land that has gone into national parks uh into game controlled areas and uh the large game parks like sorry the game reserves like the <name/> One thing which has still not been considered but which is fundamentally of importance in Tanzania still today are these tsetse areas including oddly enough even in the part of the uh uh pastoral areas and this is where a lot of the problems with the Barbaig have occurred because in the past uh it meant clearing of the bush in order to uh get rid of the tsetse Now land should be looked into The context of land ownership in Tanzania is based on number one customary rights which are user based The nineteen twenty-three ordinance as I said allowed a multiplicity of customs to be to still be perpetuated but I think at the same time although we tend to treat customary rights as something uh uniform in fact that's not true at all By nine the nineteen forties land in certain parts of the country was already being sold it was being redistributed it could be owned communally etcetera Two as I've already indicated right at the start there is this continuity of the dual system At Independence uh you might wonder why we're making such a big fuss about the state abolishing customary rights uh now whereas we didn't say anything at Independence because by then also the idea of state ownership began to come in What I'm trying to say is that both during the colonial period at Independence and at present moment the idea of state ownership is there implicitly It was first threatened in a major way by villagisation and I think now it's being threatened again by liberalisation and a factor which we have talked very little about I think also bothered by environmental factors including uh disease I'd like to elaborate on this by stating that customary land rights The origin of it is that uh there are modes of ownership which were based on entitlement There was no question in traditional society that there was a scarcity of it uh If there was a scarcity you moved you spread uh but uh everybody had a right to it and there were three modes of ownership one as a clan member two as an individual of the household three as a collective ownership of men and lastly there was also a special dimension which uh was very important in terms of collective ownership of the pastoral people Now whether you belonged to one or the other or a combination of all of them depended on the political system of the tribe and the leadership of the clan the family For example among the <name/> it was the individual who decided to move into new areas and they allowed him because if he became successful he would have more people coming in and so settlements could be fairly large depending on the individual It would also depend on the scarcity or abundance of cultivated land and after the colonial period a great deal depended on the economic crops that were being grown As a result for example of economic crops both in Bukoba and in Kilimanjaro uh land began to have a very serious market value For many reasons uh the British period did allow or it was imposed because it served the purpose of the state People became smallholder producers and it is in here that I think there is a rather interesting development by the state until villagisation for example uh the government was uh encouraging this this dual ownership because suddenly uh the state ownership uh concept was not only reinforced in nineteen sixty-two but it also allowed the state to pose as a developer And because it was failing to develop it decided to get involved with villagisation But there is another element too why the dual system uh was simply being tolerated in fact encouraged by the state and that is because it became a producer uh NALCO is Natural <O/> Company Millions were spent on it but it was it accounted for less than one per cent of the total national product despite spending millions into it and large tracts of land were actually taken away It became involved in food production NAFCO and of course all the problems that were associated with <O/> the sugar development etcetera It is in here too uh that one must look at land use and state intervention The state intervention business really started not in the drylands It started in areas of problems like the <name/> flood plains nineteen sixty-nine In nineteen seventy they decided to use the same techniques in other words civil servants deciding where people should remain and what they should be doing and that was implemented in Dodoma in the villages and the Dodoma operation then became the operation for the whole country between nineteen seventy-three and nineteen seventy-five The results of that were insecurity decline of productivity and a central control and a lack of participation in all the communities Now in the post-liberalisation period what we are beginning to see is the continuation of the breakdown of primary production systems loss of output unless it is externally generated For example uh the loss of output in cashew nut production has been quite dramatic uh from a hundred and twenty-five thousand tons we are producing less than thirty thousand tons entirely because of villagisation because now the fields were very far away the trees were uh abandoned uh they caught on fire quite easily and so unless you have uh external inputs the chances of recovering are very very low There has been also a change of the type of uh RRR of uh uh productivity demanded and that is for example you can produce a lot of cotton uh but if uh the markets and infrastructure is not there then I'm afraid that a people cannot really benefit In a liberalisation period too we're talking about market forces but these have been so imperfect uh that uh we cannot rely too much on them and then lastly I think what liberalisation is bringing out very very strongly is centralisation versus the de-centralisation of uh RRR of production It's in here that it is within this context of what I've said I'd like now to spend the rest of the time talking about the implication of Act Number Twenty-Two uh on the livelihood patterns Villagisation as I said was a major upheaval and it was not a question of land tenure but more a process of structures they created which were both contradictory in policy and in reality Now the Act is trying to legitimise these contradictions Number Two the contradictions in fact led to a great deal of corporisations of people", 'subdomain':

{'text': "Thank you very much Thank you very much for uh inviting me to this seminar uh As you might uh see in the paper which I've just circulated uh uh I I think you're going to be scared by the slight change in the title The paper's entitled Interactional Features in Writing Discussions of <O/> Writers and The Role of Imaginative Composition I think it's just a change of form rather than substance so I think it won't very much <O/> for after all I'm dwelling on exactly the same thing Now this paper is based on uh uh some research that I did for my uh doctorate but of course I just adapted part of it and the basic uh point was to look into the role of interactions on writing so I tried to look into how the various patterns of interaction may affect uh the the political writings in secondary schools Now I'll begin first of all with a general view of the developments in the time Now as is well known uh during the last two decades especially in the United States and Britain there has recently been an an interest in trying to view writing not only as uh something that has got to be marked as something uh that is an end-product but as something which is involves both cognitive and social processes and therefore there is a reason a need for trying to study how collaboration among learners or collaboration between teachers and pupils on the one hand and between pupils and pupils themselves might enhance the process of learning Now this paper therefore is going to focus on the role of interaction in learning first and then we will see how this discourse affected uh the writing I'll now first of all try to look into the discourse in learning Now communication in the classroom is seen as a gently and too shallow constructed activity However it's now evident from studies done that teachers are seen to monopolize the classroom talk As a matter of fact according to Flander's uh study Flander in nineteen seventy he's found that teachers talk most of the time seventy per cent of teachers' of utterances in the classroom are found to be uh teachers' utterances and uh the classroom becomes a sort of a power arena where power is exercised by the leader of authority who in this case is the teacher Now this is seen very much of course in the way the teacher allocates turns because in most cases the teacher allocates turns very rarely to pupils and that he does uh monopolize most of those turns Now in view of this it has been seen in some academic circles that uh group work could somehow help us towards uh uh creating an atmosphere which would probably lead to <O/> Let me now dwell a little bit on the role of pupil - pupil discourse How pupils could enhance their own learning through their own discourse Now most of the literature on pupil - pupil discourse that is uh talk between pupils and pupils  has tended to hinge on the official benefits Most American studies have hinged on the official benefits which derive for example it is assumed that uh if RRR if learners interact among themselves they can be self-confident and they can also learn to trust each other However studies done in Britain have given group-work some sort of backing by regarding it as a socio-cognitive dimension a socio-cognitive uh arena where students are able to exchange ideas where they are able to <O/> each other argue and therefore come up with something that is likely to enhance learning Now there is therefore a general consensus that group interaction  leads to structured and modified comprehensible input measured through certain interactional features as clarification requests uh cognition checks comprehension checks and repetitions Now these interactional features later lead to language acquisition according to studies done by some of the authors uh whose references are cited in the paper Now there are a number of psychological and psycholinguistic studies that have been done to uh reinforce this point of view chief among which are the works of uh <name/> and Piaget Now uh I don't want to deal at length here with this uh Piaget's theory for example of cognitive conflict presupposes that when learners are trying to perform a task together the fact that they sometimes uh do not agree creates a situation where uh by reaching a consensus they're able to come out with some uh brighter and more articulate ideas Now <name/> on the other hand the Russian psychologist and linguist sees co-operation transacted between the learner and an adult the centre of interactions and that this subsequently leads to learning and uh <name/> however does see that uh the child before the child reaches a stage where he's able to solve his own problems he needs to interact with others In other words here he says this is a point which he calls the learner proximal development On the other hand however the tasks which learners do do very much help to promote learning Now you have tasks for example the one-way-task uh  tasks which do not uh enable in us to interact among us or in solving problems may not seem to be well predisposed towards learning whereas tasks which enable learners to interact or to solve problems may <O/> to help promote learning Therefore tasks not only interaction but also tasks it's the nature of the task that they should learn in the classroom will help very much to promote a sort of uh interaction uh the sort of learning that is felt to be appropriate I will now dwell upon writing on talk and see how talk as a base of interaction does could help literacy Now pupil talk has been perceived as contributing to uh you know promoting ideas before pupils are able to learn Now such work by people like Britten Graves and others have added to this sort of conception Now some of these studies into the role of talk and writing have merely looked into interactional patterns of training teacher - student or student - student writing uh for example without stating for example how these teachers affected writing However there are a few studies which have been done and which have shown that uh when teachers I mean when students interact uh in other words when they offer each other requests and when they also engage in interactional features such as uh confirmation and so on they're able to provide themselves with uh the language that they might probably use later to uh linguistic meaning and therefore be able to write something coherent Now uh in view of this therefore what were the bases of the study Now this study was intended to look into the interaction of patterns which emerge once students are engaged in discussions about writing An attempt was made to determine which interactions lead to high quality discussions and which ones led to low quality discussions by relating them to compositions written after discussion In other words the study sought to examine whether or not the interactional features of the discussions have a bearing on the discourse and hence led to interactional features as products which means that uh basically I was trying to look into how these patterns of interaction which were likely to emerge as students were working together could help them write uh their compositions Now in so doing them uh I devised my research design this way I had a target sample of twenty-four high-ability average and low-ability pupils of secondary schools who were selected after an English cloze test had been administered Now the tasks which the students did were of two types Some of these tasks were teacher-fronted that is the task was conducted mainly or directed by the teacher and the other tasks were done in groups in pairs or various groups pair being two pupils and groups being made of six pupils The tasks were involved descriptive compositions and active compositions Now if you look at the appendix which I provided because you'll find that uh there're two completely different compositions uh which were assigned One was the teacher-directed composition and the other was uh a fundamentally different composition because of pair work Now if you look at the pictures you find that uh Have a look I don't know if you can Yeah the picture you have the pictures uh This is called teacher-fronted composition Have it there Okay So this was the teacher-fronted composition task that was <O/> by the teacher So the teacher had to describe something and then the teacher the pupils merely wrote something Then appendix b we have the instructions and the task follows This was the pair work where the pupils collaborated to do some work In other words they had pictures and they developed the topic of the pictures and then they tried to talk out </>am among themselves to see what comparison they could make of the picture You can see for example appendix b in this picture there are two pictures In one picture this picture the picture above looks to be somewhat similar to the picture below appendix b but uh we can find that there are some objects which are missing in one of the pictures so that pupils had to talk and therefore this was seen as uh being able to promote some sort of talk I mean among the pupils Now the other one was a narrative task This again was done was levied by the teacher and was also led uh by uh also done by the pupils themselves Now after the pupils when the pupils were working I took some audiotaped transcripts So audiotapes <O/> related to the study are collected using a cassette recorder Now when the lesson ended what I did was I took the tapes of the conversation preceding the tasks and then I analysed the transcripts of the discourse that had taken place between the teacher and the pupils and among the pupils themselves Now if a teacher did the coding of utterances and of the <O/> coding scheme was used Now how the operation coding scheme was worked you can see in appendix d and e So I used appendix d and e to code the uh uh code theRRR interactions which took place while they were talking Then they I also coded the activities of listening reading and writing Now an additional coding scheme was designed to observe the frequency of both teachers' and pupils' behaviour as they interacted during writing lessons Now talking listening reading and writing features were further divided into discourse acts which helped shape the interaction in the classroom Now some of the discourse acts uh are the ones which you can see in appendix f In other words uh these were somewhat based on pictures and therefore I tried to code the interaction for example if he's requesting if he's repeating or simply giving information So I tried to code the interactions on the left-hand side of the transcripts You know to find out what the students were trying what utterances the students were trying to make \nNow I'll dwell on the results of the study Now I processed the data by you know when the transcripts had been written I counted manually the frequency of these acts and later I went through the written compositions to see if the features noted in the verbal transcripts were observable in the original compositions and how these features could have been probably uh could have helped to convey information which was uh put by the students in their compositions I took a sample of twelve subjects uh These were six good performers and six bad performers Now the results of the study Now the results of the study indicated that uh the teacher's requests for students to clarify content or language form involved pupils merely completing teacher's utterances in that they are restating what the teacher had said In other words what I found was that uh if you look at the transcripts of the students uh which are provided in uh in one of these if you look at this sheet of paper which has got uh twenty-one that's page twenty-one You have the interaction of the students For example it does compare here I don't know if you have this\nTwenty-one of this small sheet of paper this one Good Now what I found out what we found out is that uh in this transcript you have the students trying to exchange ideas about something they are doing and now what we see is that the students are merely repeating the teacher's utterances and that what transpires later as they write their composition that they merely repeat what they have been actually what they've been saying in the in their discussions Now what actually this reveals is that uh students generally tend to be unaware of the differences between uh the spoken mode and the written mode And therefore it's in view of that that they're not very not veryRRR competent in being able to write something uh in line with the conventions of uh of written discourse Now another observation in six two six point two on page four you'll find that requesting explanation of content or form and the repetition seems to have been a common feature of both the high performers and the low performers with the repetitions of content being prominently a feature of the finished composition Now the nature of request for example as a discourse act varied Request for clarification led to high level talk while the request for explanation did not Now this would be due to the fact that when requesting clarification for example one is likely to learn new words or structures While a request for explanation may not necessarily lead to uh a <O/> explanation Now what I mean is that uh as students are you know are requesting for explanation the student the other student may be able to provide an explanation but this explanation did not necessarily lead to high quality of talk in the sense that what the student uh  provides as explanation may not be helpful in making the student write properly Another observation six three point six three on on page five was as regards the organization of the work itself of group work What I found was that the group work which involved six students sitting together afforded students better opportunities to expand on their statements to incorporate new ideas and subsequently to incorporate them in their writing themselves Now this might show that uh probably group work is more ideal than pair work but possibly in view of the fact that when you're pairing two students both of whom are not competent in the language they may not be able to sustain the conversation whereas if you're pairing students in a group there is a possibility of these students at least two or three of them being able to be competent enough Not all of them will be incompetent Now the impact of this on written composition is that the  compositions which were written generally uh reveal that the factors of interaction which the students displayed in their discussions were also discernible or were seen in their compositions I took a sample of twelve subjects uh These were six good performers and six bad performers Now the results of the study Now the results of the study indicated that uh the teacher's requests for students to clarify content or language form involved pupils merely completing teacher's utterances in that they are restating what the teacher had said In other words what I found was that uh if you look at the transcripts of the students uh which are provided in uh in one of these if you look at this sheet of paper which has got uh twenty-one that's page twenty-one You have the interaction of the students for example it does compare here I don't know if you have this\nTwenty-one of this small sheet of paper this one Good Now what I found out what we found out is that uh in this transcript you have the students trying to exchange ideas about something they are doing and now what we see is that the students are merely repeating the teacher's utterances and that what transpires later as they write their composition that they merely repeat what they have been actually what they've been saying in the in their

{'text': "I would like to offer uh in summary form a discussion of findings uh of ongoing work by both myself and Dr <name/> on the language of political leadership in Tanzania uh It's Part of it is ongoing work and part of it is work that I myself have been doing for the last seven years uh Let us begin by quoting uh Sir Geoffrey Howe who was the deputy prime minister in the British government of Margaret Thatcher on the uh eve of his resignation as deputy prime minister on the thirteenth of November nineteen ninety It was quoted in the Independent London and he said\nWe uh myself and Dr <name/> are interested and have been interested in that coin with the two sides you know style and substance The overall picture uh is set by uh the fact that there is growing interest in the language of political leadership among linguists and uh in this we may quote Atkinson nineteen eighty-four <name/> Atkinson discusses Reagan Thatcher Kinnock Martin Luther King and he goes back actually to Hitler Lenin and so on <name/> discussing the political leadership styles in the US nineteen eighty-seven And Wilson nineteen ninety uh attempts what he calls political leadership uh styles uh you know political speaking politically speaking in western settings and of course there you know is more recent work by Daphne and Kolinsky on uh leadership uh political leadership styles in terms of language styles of course language speaking styles oratory styles Of course in the UK West Germany then and France uh In much of the work the interest has arisen or has coincided with the major global socio-political changes that have taken place since the oil crisis nineteen seventy-three uh which culminated in the assumption of political leadership by strong and highly personalized political figures in several countries in Western Europe for example Thatcher in the UK Mr Mitterrand in France and in North America Mr Reagan and the impact of these personalities <O/> especially in terms of western scholarship as occasioning this interest among linguists uh Here in Africa in the shadow of these political changes uh we at least in Tanzania have witnessed also we have also witnessed major personnel changes especially from ninety eighty-five when you know the former founding president of the United Republic of Tanzania retired from the presidency and was succeeded by uh Mr Ali Hassan Mwinyi Now uh as the political scientist sociologist <name/> has summarised uh these changes in Tanzania in the following way He has suggested that these personnel changes in Tanzania could be characterised by nineteen eighty-five onwards could be characterised as follows The experts have displaced the politicians as the current dominant voice in the struggle for power in Tanzania A political perspective that understood development as fundamental political process and <name/> emphasized  the> politicisation mobilisation and to some extent socialism of some sort guided Tanzanian political discourse in the late sixties and the mid-seventies The early eighties however saw a return to the view that development is primarily technical process though of course requiring supportive political environment and I'm sure those of you who attend conferences maybe every now and again on market-oriented performance they hear this word political environment a lot so that development is principally a technical process a process that economists know better how to enter not politicians but at the same time politicians are needed to create the inappropriate political climate in which these technical people could perform their duties So it is that sort of background I mean which has occasioned you can see uh on *on> the handout which is the number the page number one ninety uh which has occasioned the kind of concerns that we thought uh and still believe would be of of interest to a linguist and that could constitute what a linguist could call uh a unique area of contribution unique area of contributionRRR by the linguist to any ongoing socio-political changes These areas uh are to do as you can see there about five we've selected variation uh you know in the deployment of the following language forms for instance features which affect pausing intonation subordination and some human behaviour like laughing We thought you know those could merit you know investigation by linguists by a linguist and then also syntactic devices like the use of existential and passive clauses which help in the staging of message chunks Existential uh clauses would be for those who are not linguists I see uh uh clauses that have been introduced by there are for instance There are those who etcetera There are those who you know where you know uh you know that would be along the same sort of lines as uh you know the passive clauses which again would be saying things without you know spelling out the authors of those things that are happening so you know a good example would be for instance say you know food is eaten instead of I eat food uh where you'd have passified and left out I eat food or people eat food and then the vocabulary choices resulting in the nouns versus verbs ratio characterising human message chunks where you know as uh Halliday Michael Halliday in the nineteen eighty-five paper suggested and I quote here I think that education to uh give a paper of this one on the ideas of Michael Halliday where as I quote\nOkay You know Halliday went with others to suggest that uh written discourse would be characterised by a higher proportion of nouns as opposed to verbs and you know spoken discourse you know written discourse will be characterised by a higher proportion the use of a higher proportion of nouns than verbs while spoken discourse would be characterised by you know higher proportion of use of verbs as opposed to nouns So I mean that sort of interest we thought you know I mean is some is an area you know where you might use a moderning style and substance by political speakers moderning which is of relevance to a linguist you see And then uh number five pronominal selection which manipulate which is manipulated to realise face management or politeness pronominal selection Here we mean the use of pronouns like I or we or he or they and so on okay which are in a such selection as is manipulated to create either you know to reduce the extent to which people's faces are threatened in a negative or positive way I mean in the sense for instance if I want to order villagers and I'm a president to put manure into their farms I might say We have to put manure in our farms although I don't have a farm actually I'm just telling them to do it you see but I'm reducing the extent of distance between myself and them by including myself in the people who are going to put manure in the farms So the use of we uh you know is manipulative and then these dimensions we suggest they're you know you know that these dimensions along with the use of linguistic forms that vary would include <the speech mode dimension For example the style of speech delivery would vary according to whether the speech was scripted or unscripted again bringing in bringing inRRR the idea you know <O/> by Halliday of speech versus you know written versus spoken discourse okay The study showed that the scripted the study by <name/> nineteen ninety-two shows that the scripted versus unscripted distinction tended to mirror the extent to which features that typify written discourse are deployed in the given spoken texts scripted oratory deploying more written discourse features than unscripted oratory irrespective of the speaker and I mean and you know we want to suggest that you know much as we might notice a lot of substance differences between Nyerere and Mwinyi there are certain stylistic features that they share And then the audience dimension the audience design dimension uh which is to say the influence which is exerted on the speaker by the socio-political profiles of the participants of the speech event for example whether the audience consists of village peasants senior political senior national political leaders or a mixture of peasants workers and politicians you know who we usually call the mass you know This audience design dimension influencing the you know the style is neatly shown in the work that uh my colleague <name/> has done uh on you know say parliamentary language where code switching you know which is done there more often than it would be done by the same politicians if they are speaking to a village audience or you know uh when especially in the past when say Julius Nyerere as the president would go out to the regions he will call he will speak > to regional leaders and there will be more English there more code switching into English And when we go to a public audience a public square you know we reduce the extent to which we code switch into English again you know showing that the audience design you know the people you are addressing influence the kind of language you might use The finally the physical dimension where you know indirect influence is exerted on your speech delivery by factors such as whether the speech is delivered in an assembly hall uh in an open field in a village in a town football stadium or a city square Okay all these are factors that definitely might uh might the language the style that is Now uh very quickly maybe it will not be possible to go through all the sort of observations we've arrived at I will uh quickly go through some of the observations that are striking you know deriving from the work by <name/> ninety ninety-two on the on what he has called Tanzanian political uh Tanzanian political Kiswahili uh Tanzanian presidential Kiswahili political oratory where you know it's looking at the language of presidents when they give speeches Now a number of observations you know have been you know found and the most telling you know are the following okay uh One can make a series of points relating to the <O/> speakers' variation within the presidential speeches in Tanzania Firstly Julius Nyerere whose style of speech ever  tends to be bookish Julius Nyerere's style tended to be bookish and bombastic was also one we incontestably qualified as the foremost ideology builder you know and therefore this is uh contrasted in terms of the observation with Ali Hassan Mwinyi whose speeches whose style is analysable as colloquial and now I'm using the word colloquial very carefully as it is used by <name/> to mean that it is less bookish in a positive sense actually uh right and <O/> that is used by <name/> tended to play more the role of an ideology player and less that of an ideology builder okay and a very good example in terms of vocabulary for instance would be Mwinyi's use of He interpreted phrases You know Mwinyi tended to interpret the collocative meaning range of ideologically important nominal expressions such as <ea/><O/> for instance in you know <name/> okay or <ea/> and you find <ea/> is an expression for capitalist in <name/> When he uses the word <ea/><O/> in <O/> where he uses <ea/><O/> for <ea/><O/> One sort of <ea/><O/> does not translate incontestably into <ea/><O/> you know He's casting negative connotations But Mwinyi on the other hand has sought to reinterpret the terms <O/> for instance to mean you know being assertive you know and as a manager ever knowing what you are doing etcetera And also indeed actually you find <O/> Mwinyi In nineteen ninety-one I think speech to elders of Dar es Salaam which was itself actually a bit of a problem because you know I mean it was built as a speech to elders of Dar es Salaam but actually it was organised by the businessmen and he used the occasion to reinterpret the meaning of businessman to say that you know there are three categories of Tanzanian not just two you know <ea/><O/> but you'll also find <ea/><O/> where previously <ea/><O/> was interpreted to mean you know a category a subcategory of <ea/><O/> you know meaning you know a worker in the private sector you see <ea/>>O/> So now you know obviously in a way since these are terms defined clearly in documents that he would himself actually owe allegiance to or at least owe legitimacy to then it would seem that Mwinyi was in a way uh you know blurring the meaning the sort of distinction range you know and encouraging a more liberal laissez-faire you know attitude towards these documents as well as their definitions okay And very quickly you know in terms of ideology builder like Julius Nyerere uh we would say that he tended to use laughter and other prosodic features to humour his strictures against fellow political leaders whom he tended to harangue more than to lecture And I think we have an example there of Julius Nyerere there on the handout with the page one four seven There he says <ea_><ea/> humour there okay audience laughs <ea_><ea/> because obviously he's playing on humour I mean and there is a whole range of activities about humour <ea_><ea/> and yet while he was saying <ea/><O/> this was some time later in the speech it can be added that the issue wasn't picked up by the media He was encouraging the media to pick up what he was saying This is why he kept turning to it again and again one of sacking corrupt co-operative union bosses some of whom were with him on the speech platform because this was a speech he was giving for <name/> day in <name/> and you know I remember you know <name/> was there <O_><O/> and he kept referring to him you know I mean and one can and he wasn't the president then actually he was only the chairman so one can imagine he was trying to push them to do something using their speech but you know couching such you know strictures in humorous text so as you know not to offend some kind of uh face management you know device and he's very good at that Again and again there are many examples when he would you know he would want for instance say things which are you know like I mean once for instance he was giving a speech in Dodoma This is after the conference in nineteen eighty-six where Mwinyi in December said a number of things needed to be changed and there's <name/> in eighty-seven giving a speech celebrating twenty years of <O/> Arusha He then started by saying you know I too think there must be a few changes in <name/> and everybody clapped even those on the platform including the president of course Ali Hassan Mwinyi okay And then he followed that you know by saying you'd be amazed at the kind of things I'm going to suggest ought to be changed and then following that by saying we needed to have a bit of editing to remove things reference to TANU CCM <name/> which obviously having I mean he was telling Because Ali Hassan Mwinyi's speech had been prominently put in the papers you know which he gave to a conference So oh yes you can't tell me as a linguist analysing you know calmly <name/> wasn't trying to say no move away from this idea of change although we know subsequently of course there was the Zanzibar change okay So perhaps maybe people are going to wish to discuss and my colleague here has agreed to chip in at the end maybe I will say one more thing about Ali Hassan Mwinyi so that you can see the contrast uh President Mwinyi tends to use involvement markers such as the use of hearer inclusive we the first person  plural pronoun and the use of a greater proportion of verbs than nouns to construct the message chunks His speech style is in perfect accord with the trends towards ideology bearing which seems to have gradually become a distinct characteristic of the political disposition of the Tanzanian government ever since the acute economy crisis of the seventies forced it to accept them and with strictures", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "My understanding of uh what the <name/> commission has done or has said insofar as civil organisations are concerned There are there is one or two points which I thought are preliminary points which I thought I should make before I go looking at the particular aspects The first one is that I was actually very much impressed uh by the thoroughness of the report which was prepared by this particular commission But after going through the book one okay I started wondering whether or in that particular in their zeal the commissioners had whether the commissioners in their zeal had not actually exceeded uh their limits which were set out in the terms of reference For instance my impression was that the commissioners actually attempted to either rewrite a history on party on party politics or at least they have given an honest impression or honest <O/> of party politics and I say this particularly as regards the history of CCM I have been educated in here from primary school up to the university level and I remember in primary education and secondary education when it came to teaching us about the history of party politics they usually started with Tanganyika African Association uh In this report I was delighted to find that at least they have gone a step back and looking at African Associations which in other words simply emphasises the fact that the political parties which came to be formed in our country had started or had their beginnings in civil organisations as such African Association was a civil organisation and it answered all the It had all the necessary elements which distinguish it as a civil organisation and it is from this particular organisation African Association that we have uh political parties such as KANU coming into existence It is actually a progenitor to this particular party KANU and also it is a progenitor to the <name/> party of Zanzibar This is something which comes out quite clearly in the report and it shows quite clearly that civil organisations are quite important That is the first thing which impressed me insofar as the historical aspect of this particular report is concerned I The second thing which I should make as a preliminary observation is actually a point which comes out in almost all report writings In almost all report writings the people who are set out to write that particular report after collecting various data collecting data and all that when it comes to writing and the BBB RRR it is very difficult to avoid putting out their views instead of those which were supposed to be uh which were actually given by the people Now in this regard what I'm saying is that what is stated in this particular report is not confined merely to systematisation of the views and points which were given by the people generally but actually I can detect that it reflects the report itself reflects the views which were held by the commissioners Well I'm not saying that this is a bad thing only that I'm saying that here we are where we are supposed to write to systematise I mean the report the whole intention was actually of the commission was simply to systematise the views and opinions of the people concerning whether they want to have one party or multi-party and how to widen democracy in our country but I fear that what has come out is more than that only that in this particular aspect the commissioners may have had held these particular views whether they were actually expressed by the people or not As I have noted that this is not a bad thing only that it is a reflection of what we have This is even more prominent in cases of politics that is politicians will not want to put up a suggestion They will normally say that the people say this and that but actually they are the ones who are saying it uh I'm interested in part three of the fourth term of reference which in my uh independent interpretation the report is written in Kiswahili at least the first book uh and the second is written in Kiswahili except for the third which concerns law That one is written in English as usual uh In the first part I'm interested in the fourth term of reference which is discussed in detail in book one This part talked about the purpose of <O/> of reference is that the commission was required to suggest ways in which democracy could be increased And also the commission was supposed to suggest ways in which they could instil either what is known as a political culture or democratic culture in the country irrespective of the form of government form of governmentRRR which is meant to be suggested by that particular politic by the commission In other words the commission was required to give suggestions on how the democracy could be increased Okay they It is an admission that it was novel that democracy was a little bit uh restricted did not not altogether not existing and the commission was required to suggest ways in which this particular democracy could be increased in our country and also the purpose I mean another thing which was supposed to be presented or to be suggested by the commission was actually instilling what I fail to get the proper word but it's either political culture or democratic culture into the society how this is going to be instilled in the society Now it is upon this that the element of civil organisations comes into play It has been noted It has been stated in various parts of this particular report that and actually the my colleagues who have <O/> earlier on that is the day before yesterday have actually stated quite clearly that democracy is not assured by simply having several parties political parties Political parties alone cannot ensure that there is democracy Now in realisation of that particular fact then the commissioners in my understanding of this particular report were required to look into ways of either strengthening or instilling that particular democratic culture into our country That aspect as I have noted earlier on is asked on page  from page fifteen on of the first book that is part two of their report This report deals with aspects I mean the this particular report deals with this particular aspect that is of civil organisation s and it is titled again in my interpretation political situation before and after independence Obviously there are some other parts which are discussing this particular element of civil organisations but in the main the historical aspect or the historical part is discussed in this uh particular part that is from page fifteen onwards of the first book The first thing which comes out quite clearly is that the report tries to look at three things Okay It tries to answer three basic things That is why when and how these organisations came into being Okay there 's particular civil organisations in plus political organisations came into being and here as I have said they discuss the origins of political parties and they note quite clearly that they had their beginnings in civil organisations I don't think I have to go into the details of what was stated in there but there are some features which are quite important and they come out quite clear in that particular report The first one was that it is the circumstances existing at that particular time for instance in nineteen twenties up to nineteen thirties the economic hardships okay which brought together the people various people who felt the need to establish civil organisations It is the circumstances which were obtaining at the particular time which compelled the people to form civil organisations The second thing which is quite important is the spontaneity of these particular organisations No one came to tell the people that you should form organisations They felt the need They organised themselves and they organised themselves on the lines of that particular need Okay here's a group of people who had a problem a common problem And they thought that if they wanted to resolve that particular problem or at least to mitigate its effects then they had to come together and establish something which will reflect their interests You see Now the element of spontaneity is quite important in the sense that we have organisations which start at the grassroots the grassrootsRRR level instead of having organisations that started at the top as is quite fashionable right now We have organisations which have started at the top and they're supposed to cater for the needs of the people with definitely uh failure which is quite evident This is the second thing which was is quite important which comes out of that particular historical analysis And then there is a third thing which is also important And this is one is the problem of putting demarcation between the roles objectives aims and goals of civil organisations and political activities I mean it's very difficult to put a very clear demarcation between the aims objectives and goals of civil organisations and political goals Now this had two-fold effect The first one is that it led the governments whatever whether it's colonial or the independent governments to actually try and either control or suppress these civil organisations The lack of demarcation the fact that the aims of these civil organisations however they were defined or whatever their aims or goals were meant that in the final analysis they came to be interpreted as political goals The lack of definition or the lack of demarcation between these two definitely meant that these organisations uh were actually a subject of either separation by the governments both the colonial and independent governments or at least  try and control them This is something which comes out quite clearly in this particular report Now the colonial government had various had started actually they had simply started and this came to be done even with more efficiency by the independent government and trying to control this they used mainly two ways First by enacting  legislation passing legislation pieces of legislation which could at least either suppress or control the particular these civil organisations or in cases of Zanzibar for instance there was outright force in eliminating these uh civil organisations The statutes which are discussed in this particular report which were used by the colonial government and later on adopted and modified and even perfected one could say by the uh independent government include such  legislation as trade unions ordinance co-operative ordinance and co-operative various co-operatives acts which were passed by independent governments uh the trade unions' ordinance society's ordinance and the rest I mean there are quite a number of statutes which are discussed by this particular report and they all show one thing that is they either want to suppress the civil organisations at least if they can be if they cannot be suppressed altogether then they are aimed at being eliminated by the governments in power The reasons why these uh the civil organisations were actually particularly those which had goals which tended to interfere or which had very little demarcation between politics and their objectives was the fact that these political these civil organisations tended to threaten the governments in power an this was something which could not be accepted by these governments and therefore they tended to want to suppress them as I have noted Now there are a number of things which emerged particularly after independence There are a number of trends actually which emerged after independence uh which are quite important and they are and they are discussed quite at length in this particular report The first one which is quite pervasive in its influence is the doctrine of white supremacy\nThe fact that the party wanted to assume the powers of discussing all issues or dealing with all issues which arise and all matters which had to be discussed by the people had to be done under the umbrella of the party I believe the this is something which was discussed quite at length by my colleagues the day before yesterday so I won't go into the details of that particular element but it's important to note that it is very difficult and this something which was realised then and it has actually been pointed out quite clearly by the report that one political party or so many political parties cannot effectively represent the interest of various people I'll give just one example uh People in <name/> area are terrorised and actually they are being harassed out of existence by lions but then there are people here in Dar es Salaam mainly and Arusha who say that lions are quite important as a tourist attraction Therefore if one organisation wants to represent the interest of the people of <name/> and at the same time they want to represent the interests of people who are living in Dar es Salaam and who view the lions as uh an important inheritance or heritage which needs to be preserved for the future generation then we'll definitely have problems And secondly the fact that these people are talking about they may be talking about lions that element can also develop into I mean the intention in putting forward their views they will definitely want to put and come up with a policy and once they want to put up the policy then they'll definitely fall in the domain of politics and in that case the difference between the mere aspect of looking at lions will turn into a political issue and the demarcation between a pressure group which wants to either to eliminate lions or to preserve the lions become a political issue and as such each wants to be dominated by the the<_/> political party That is one thing which comes out quite clearly in this particular report that one political party or even so many political parties cannot represent the interests of so many people who have diverging interests and they want to put them in a different way or to express them in very different ways and manners Now if only one political party or several political parties for that matter want to have a monopoly of this particular business of talking or representing the interests of various groups in the society then uh definitely democracy is being snuffed out The other element which uh is quite responsible which a trend which has been shown which was quite unfavourable to the development of serious or very serious civil organisations is are the policies various policies which are enunciated by the party particularly the policies of what is known as developmentism These are the policies which were enunciated particularly with uh much vigour from nineteen sixty-one up to nineteen sixty-seven Now the policies of developmentism had one effect in that they tried to interfere into almost every sphere Now if these particular policies are coupled with the party supremacy then we have the government wanting to put its finger into almost everything uh in such a way the civil organisations are actually snuffed out The other element which uh is quite responsible which a trend which has been shown which was quite unfavourable to the development of serious or very serious civil organisations is are the policies various policies which are enunciated by the party particularly the policies of what is known as developmentism These are the policies which were enunciated particularly with uh much vigour from nineteen sixty-one up to nineteen sixty-seven Now the policies of developmentism had one effect in that they tried to interfere into almost every sphere Now if these particular policies are coupled with the party supremacy then we have the government wanting to put its finger into almost everything uh in such a way the civil organisations are actually snuffed out There are very good examples here insofar as these policies of developmentism are concerned and this is the relationship between the government and <O/> federation of labour for instance something which is discussed quite at length in part two of this report And also there is relationship between the government the party and the government and co-operatives", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'df9cfcf8-2552-4fb7-8ec1-a70922237081', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.208560+00:00',

{'text': "Well as professor <name/> mentioned I'm going to talk about uh Zanzibar and particularly the question of ethnicity in the context of the revolution and the aftermath In nineteen sixty-four barely a month after Zanzibar achieved independence from Britain there was a bloody revolution It was one of the first of the firstRRR coups in Africa of which now we've become very familiar we've become used to it uh In Zanzibar which was a very small country at that time with a population of less than three hundred thousand quite a large number of people were killed between three thousand and thirteen thousand and many others went into exile many onto the mainland and others further afield Now they're scattered all over the world Now this revolution at the time was described as the overthrow of an Arab minority by the African majority and that interpretation has more or less remained It was the interpretation which was picked up immediately in the newspapers and some of the social science uh work which was being done at the time And this is what I would like to deal with uh to what extent the Zanzibar revolution was an overthrow merely of a racial minority because if the revolution was occurred to solve a racial problem in Zanzibar then it would not have been necessary thirty years later now for us to discuss the revolution because it would have been an aspect of history maybe for the historians to deal with But the problem is that until today some of the fundamental problems of Zanzibar the conflicts internal political conflicts still persist So it must raise a question What did the revolution do What did it try to solve and why do we have persistent problems And my argument would be that the racial conflict was merely a thin veneer over much deeper social problems linked with Zanzibar Most of the analyses of Zanzibar particularly the ones that have taken a racial interpretation start with the last census of Zanzibar which uh gave a racial breakdown of the population of Zanzibar And that census showed that there were seventy-six per cent so-called Africans and I'm putting that in inverted commas I will expect it will become clear why Seventeen per cent were Arabs and seven per cent were Indians and other minorities But it was very obvious to anybody who knows about Zanzibar is that the African majority of seventy-six per cent will not act as a single social and political group So very quickly the people who had begun to adopt a racial interpretation an ethnic interpretation began now to try to see further sub-divisions So then they began to make a distinction between the indigenous Africans who constituted something like fifty-six per cent and the mainland Africans who are something like nineteen per cent And then once you start on an ethnic interpretation we begin to slip even further and among the indigenous Africans you get further sub-divisions into the so-called tribes And I don't need to give you all these details The question is whether these racial pigeon holes which the social scientists are fond of whether they speak of a stable historical reality in the case of Zanzibar And this question comes up particularly if you bear in mind the history of Zanzibar over the previous two thousand years Zanzibar is located as the rest of the East African coast as a area of interaction between Africa on the one hand and the Indian Ocean on the other hand For two thousand years the two worlds have been meeting along the coast and this is where it makes it difficult to uh have an ethnic interpretation If you look for example if you just start with the censuses themselves in answering the question whether these racial categories speak of any historical reality you'll find that there is one ethnic group which I did not mention which is the Swahili and everybody knows that Swahili is spoken along the East African coast and there must be people who are Swahili The census of nineteen twenty-four showed that there were thirty-four thousand Swahilis in Zanzibar The census of nineteen forty-eight showed that they had disappeared from history None at all or a very small number There is another category called the Shirazi These are the people who are considered the indigenous Africans of Zanzibar They numbered twenty-six thousand in nineteen twenty-four increased to forty-one thousand in nineteen thirty-one And yet when we come to nineteen forty-eight they had disappeared from the list I will Unfortunately I wasn't able to make enough copies but if you could just share these around you can see from the graphs how these two ethnic groups commit ethnic hara-kiri as they would say and just disappear The reason why these ethnic categories are not stable is precisely what I said about uh the long history of interaction between different people of different ethnic origins that had been living along the East African coast There has always been a considerable amount of intermarriage among the people themselves People who would uh be considered African by one will be considered Arab by another We even have a category in Zanzibar they say <ea/><O/> In other words people have to swear that I'm an Arab because otherwise he would not be recognised as an Arab because of the long history of uh intermarriage of adoption of the Swahili culture Most of the Arabs in Zanzibar until the revolution hardly could speak Arabic most of them were Swahili speaking and some of them <O/> as much as major literary figures in Swahili But ethnically they would be considered as people of Arabic origin So there was a lot of intermarriage uh between these various people Uh obviously intermarriage doesn't erase all distinctions There are class distinctions uh distinctions of origin and so on But the brief point is that ethnicity in Zanzibar is not a biological category not something that you can count in terms of the percentage of Arab blood that somebody has It is much more of a sociological dimension There are differences there are distinctions in society These are sometimes expressed in ethnic terms but very often they reflect class relations within the society distinctions of culture and a number of other aspects Now what does origin then Why was ethnic consideration taken to be as important in Zanzibar uh And I think something that this process that I've been describing of interaction between various uh groups that had been going on throughout all its history and particularly in the nineteenth century that when we come to the colonial period there is a certain degree of freezing of these ethnic categories which can be traced to the colonial policies I know this has become sometimes a cliché but it is still nevertheless true that the colonial rulers wherever they could they tried to divide the society into races and various ethnic groups for ease of government So in the case of uh Zanzibar these were categorised as races and each of these races was given an appropriation of uh labour So in the case of Zanzibar the Arabs were described as landowners the Asians as merchants and the Africans as uh the workers After independence a lot of these colonial categories were questioned throughout Africa and even Zanzibar But for quite a few social scientists they had difficulty accepting this easy or rather rejecting the easy interpretation of the history of Zanzibar They tried to experiment with other labels like using Marx' categories of class So they said okay races are not uh usable for tribes but uh classes are They are perfectly acceptable So if Arabs are landowners then you are talking about classes But the problem is that race and class do not coincide that all the racial all the ethnic uh boundaries cut across class-lines And again I might <O/> distribute another graph And I'll try now to explain how these different classes emerged not merely just taking as it occurred at the particular time I think basically you can say that the pattern of social differentiation in Zanzibar as I said began to develop during the nineteenth century when Zanzibar developed two sectors of the colony which were very important throughout the history One that it was a centre of trade for the whole of Eastern Africa for various reasons that we don't really need to go But all the trade of Eastern Africa of Kenya Uganda Tanganyika and in parts beyond it was generally through Zanzibar And that gave rise to an important merchant class which monopolised the trade and from which they benefited This merchant class was to start with uh Arab led by the Sultan of Oman at that time Said Said <name/> but it was also joined very early on by the Indians who had come there They joined uh as merchants partly because they did not have an opening into land ownership That I will mention later on So these began to constitute a merchant class from the nineteenth century But what is important here to remember is that although this constituted an important merchant class the whole of the commercial empire that Zanzibar built up in the nineteenth century began to break down with the colonial partition of Africa So the merchant class living in Zanzibar no longer had control over its hinterland over Kenya which became British Tanganyika which became German and so on And therefore the merchant class in Zanzibar began to be impoverished Many of them migrated to the mainland Those who remained in Zanzibar many of the sons had to change their profession from from trade into civil service become teachers and so on Some of them went into lending money to the landowners But the important thing I want to leave you with is that this merchant class that had developed in the nineteenth century \nSo this merchant class began to disintegrate and a large proportion of uh the former merchant class had actually been reduced to small shopkeepers civil servants teachers and so on artisans So that was one sector of the economy on which Zanzibar had thrived in the nineteenth century and how the classes had begun to disintegrate The second was the plantation sector During the nineteenth century uh Zanzibar developed as a major plantation area growing cloves the spice cloves for which Zanzibar became famous And that plantation of course economy was based on slave labour coming from the interior of Africa Initially the big landowners were Arabs uh particularly Oman Arabs who had come with the Sultan and who were given large parcels of land But cloves like anybody who knows about Zanzibar and the clove economy the clove economy is very unstable uh Production fluctuation very very widely from year to year and the prices accordingly also fluctuate So it was a very dangerous venture for any land-owning class So even during the nineteenth century the merchant class and the land-owning class was unstable Many of them were getting impoverished To add to these normal problems two events occurred in the eighteen seventies which broke the back of the land-owning class The first was a major hurricane which hit Zanzibar in eighteen seventy-two which wiped out almost the whole of the uh clove plantation area almost the whole of it So all the clove trees had to be replanted Now that hurricane was in eighteen seventy-two In eighteen seventy-three slave trade was abolished so that no fresh supplies of labour could come in Now under these conditions the land-owning class which is already precarious now had problems of dealing with shortage of labour and the problem of replanting And the net result was that they were not able to do it Not all of them were able to do it Many of them were forced to sell part of their land in order to buy or to get labour to replant Many of them got heavily in debt And in this process of trying to re-establish themselves as uh clove producers they were forced to apart from selling the land they were also forced to make arrangements with the local peasant population in Zanzibar and the two islands of <name/> and <name/> in order to get labour without having to pay money because they didn't have money", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "This afternoon we're going to present a seminar on social problems uh There are many social problems in our contemporary societies which in most of the cases are pretty much the same There are causes of these problems as well <Name/> argued these social problems are prevalent because there are ill-mannered lazy and irresponsible people By ill-mannered people he means those individuals who behave or having manners which are not capable or accepted in a particular value consensus of a particular social group Lazy people are those who do things unwillingly or do little work Irresponsible people are those who do things without a proper sense or those who do not do what they are supposed or should do like doing a certain duty or uh caring a thing or person Now in this seminar uh we'll define social problems according to different writers emergence of social problems causes and their social control We'll take truancy poverty homosexuality unemployment and criminality as our case studies Finally we will conclude by insisting that some problems like unemployment and poverty are not necessarily caused by lazy people and for some problems the causes may be uh irresponsible people In this uh question uh yeah we we'll use uh structural functionalist and Marxist approaches uh The social problems as defined by <name/> in his book known as Social Problems nineteen-seventy are those conditions which have a negative impact on individual and social well-being as identified by sociological analysis of the organisation and functioning uh of a society Another sociologist <name/> in his book Social Problems defines a social problem as a condition which is defined by a considerable number of persons as a deviation from some social norms which they cherish Also according to Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences social problems are described as perplexing questions about human societies proposed for solution So from these definitions we can simply say that a social problem is any condition which affects the majority of the members of society negatively The most common social problems existing in many societies are drug addiction alcoholism criminality poverty teenage pregnancy uh delinquency prostitution marriage and divorce problems mental illness and homosexuality And uh in this particular uh seminar the focus will be on truancy unemployment homosexuality poverty and crime uh Now let's begin with uh the emergence of social problems uh Something only becomes a social problem when people see it as  a> threatening and undesirable For a social problem to emerge there must be people saying that uh something is wrong and that they want it stopped Hence the reaction of the significant group is crucial uh There must be some socially significant groups declaring an action or a condition to be a social problem But also there must be more through institutional support uh for instance church against abortion or mass media to publicise the problem educate the people and making it open to public opinion Without institutional or mass media support a social problem uh may never emerge This can well be uh illustrated by uh smoking Many people believe it is bad and dangerous but they get little institutional or mass media support uh but uh nowadays at least there are some uh uh institutional support and mass media that smoking is uh dangerous You'll find that in many places they write in buses or cars in public places you find uh that smoking is forbidden smoking is not allowed no smoking and so on But as this must occur for something to emerge as a social problem uh a loss of interest and concern can lead to disappearance of social problem For example in North America now with regard to premarital sex where there is little strongly organised criticism among groups with social power or influence Also in some societies social drinking does not become a social problem because many people do it and they do not want to be criticised They have controls placed over their right to drink But the best reason for this is that there is an institutional support Traditionally social drinking is a custom of many tribes in Africa uh Tanzania included but in some it is not and so it is a social problem For example in Zanzibar uh social drinking any alcoholic drinking is undesirable It's not allowed It's not known uh Therefore a social problem is uh not transferable I mean from one society to another It is only a social problem in a particular social context and another good illustration is the smoking of marijuana It is legal in Jamaica but it's illegal in many other societies However most societies have pretty much the same social problems Now let us see what are the general causes of social problems uh There are some general causes of social problems which differ among various interest social groups and they need to be identified in part First of all deviance By deviance it means any act which goes against the norms and values of a particular society by an individual or corporate members of a group which disregards to flout the norms and values uh This is the major constituent of social problems With society not being blamed the individual is not the only one uh to blame for most social problems uh What has frequently come to be blamed is one institution the family Most people belong to families but the families are not organised collectively anyway So they are easy to criticise and have no means of fighting back The family often gets blamed for such deviant behaviour because apart from reproduction the primary function of this institution is the inheritance of culture uh morals norms and values to the new members of society It is its responsibility to make sure that the uh children do not deviate from the culture They conform to the norms and values of the society We must also confess that family is not the only institution responsible for culture maintenance uh There are other secondary ones like schools and religious institutions Well from the structural and functionalist approach uh when a member of society deviates from the culture this indicates that one of the institutions responsible for shaping the behaviour of the individuals does not operate effectively Hence it is argued sometimes that uh social problems are there because of irresponsible members of society and these are often irresponsible parents and elders Through the socialisation process uh individuals acquire certain uh behaviour Well uh On the other hand it is sometimes argued that uh heredity that is the transmission of physical traits from a parent to offspring has been <O/> uh and it is so it is to a certain extent today uh considered uh uh the causative factor in some social problems like crime but this argument is open to doubt because nothing is inherited as a social problem uh It is the socialisation that uh one is brought up with which shapes  one's behaviour and this process is not inherited anyway but it is acquired Mass media Mass media has close relationship with the causes of social problems TV can be an indirect cause for instance There is some evidence that some viewers engage or imitate some bad behaviour due to the coverage of certain crimes or violence on TV Individual's pathology For some problems the cause may be individual's pathology which means that he or she has frustrations mental illness or hysteria Also another cause of social uh problems is uh social change Both positive and negative social changes may lead to some problems Urbanization or industrialization for example can lead to air pollution and delinquency Also from Marxian perspective it can be argued that division of labour can lead to some members of society having little wealth If the wealth is not distributed proportionally some members will be poor A good illustration is seen in slave and capitalist modes of production The major means of production are owned by the minority slave masters and bourgeoisie respectively Hence the majority of the masses remain poor As a result some members are forced to engage in other ways to support themselves regardless they are accepted or not such as prostitution or robbery Now let us examine uh some uh of the social problems and discuss the view that uh there are social problems because there are ill-mannered and uh irresponsible lazy people Poverty It is the condition of those men and women who lack one or more of the essentials of human life It is believed by some people of the middle and upper classes that people are poor because they do not want to work But this contention is debatable It is a misconception Is work a solution of poverty uh Sometimes you may work and have low income or one may have work and have a little income or one may have a job and gain a higher income but uh things are sold expensively a high price for a household to afford more than uh people can afford uh On the other hand poverty is caused or is linked to many other social problems such as crime and delinquency Hence poverty is not only caused by lazy people but it can be viewed as a long process which should be analysed historically Colonialism including slave trade affected the economies of many African societies The resources were taken including the energetic people to America and Europe The consequences of these changes have led to many social problems like poverty Another social problem is alcoholism Alcoholism may be defined as a condition which arises from excessive consumption of alcoholic beverages World Health Organisation has defined alcoholics as those excessive drinkers whose dependence on alcohol has attained such a degree that they show noticeable mental and bodily disturbance uh Yes their interpersonal relations and their smooth social and economic functioning uh who show the uh <O/> sign of uh such development It is a social problem that leads to crime incurring debts and sometimes alcoholics are responsible for many accidents which occur on our roads Under the influence of alcohol  individuals may become active boisterous aggressive silent or unconscious uh In many African societies alcoholism is not regarded as criminal behaviour or a form of major deviant behaviour since people seem to have a reasonable capacity for alcohol consumption But for some societies consuming any amount of alcohol is deviance from culture and hence uh it is uh a social problem to that particular society Unemployment uh Unemployment is a condition in which capable uh person having the right and willingness to work is unable through no fault of his own to find work commensurate with his ability and reasonable demands It is not only an important social problem for those who can't work but it is also problematic because society must come up with some form of uh support of the unemployed through either welfare or unemployment compensation taken from the taxes of the others More indirect but also important is the fact that unemployment is related to such social problems as crime poverty and family difficulties Unemployment can also be related to problems of health The person who has had serious physical or mental health problems not get a job because of his medical uh history Also unemployment is an  evitable><inevitable> evitable><inevitable>RRR consequence of technical change For example in the nineteen thirties in North America thousands of men were hired to dig ditches but that job was made obsolete with the development of digging machines Criminality It is a behaviour that deviates from the norms of a particular community to a degree considered dangerous to the society Some examples of criminality are robbery rape or murder those uh the offences against the prevailing laws of the particular society Most criminals commit offences when there is insufficiency of being capable or to satisfy their needs through the normal channels of their salaries or incomes This may consequently resort to crime to satisfy their appetites Another social problem is truancy uh Truancy means that uh a child runs away from home usually from the countryside to the urban areas This is mainly caused by broken marriages or broken homes By broken homes it means that parents are separated or divorced or one or both parents are dead crowded home  conditions or one or more members of the family are criminalistic immoral or alcoholic This problem is found much more frequently in urban areas A group of youths form uh gang delinquency uh gang delinquents such as <name/> of Tanzania uh in the street corners Parents or elders are responsible for the supervision of their children Hence irresponsibility of the parents for their children results in this form of behaviour Another social problem is homosexuality This is a behaviour which involves sexual relations with members of one's own sex The beliefs about the causes of homosexuality have changed A century ago the causes were attributed to the bad seed of one's ancestors and there was no cure because it is impossible to reverse heredity In  the> contemporary times the causes may be placed in two into two groupings medical and social uh Medical explanation There is a view that homosexuality is a disease or illness and should be regarded as medical problem It is also described that uh it is a manifestation of some sexual abnormality and some disturbed personality development Another explanation is social explanation uh From sociological viewpoint young mammals who have not uh been previously conditioned will react to any sufficient sexual stimuli whether these are uh autoerotic heteroerotic or homoerotic in character Consequently homosexuality like heterosexuality is learned through one's social experiences with regard to the sex itself The causes of female homosexuality come to be viewed uh sociologically as a project of the total and on-going environment which includes the family peer groups various legal and societive penalties and sanctions and sub-cultural expectations all of which help to shape homosexuality \nNow we have seen uh these social problems as we have discussed Now let us see what is their social control Social control first of all means all collective efforts to ensure conformity to the norms of society so as to prevent deviance by eliminating its causes Its main function is resocialisation of people so that they cease wanting to deviate In many societies the major effort in preventing crime and deviance has been directed towards removing its causes Here the emphasis has been placed on childhood socialisation like social problems social controls differ from one society to another depending on the problem concerned Social control includes also scolding beating ostracism fine imprisonment and even death so as to discourage and penalise the deviants for failing to conform to culture Now I can conclude by saying that social problems can uh those which are in the form of deviant behaviour like crime abortion prostitution homosexuality Also there are social problems which are not in the form of deviance such as unemployment and poverty Some of these problems such as truancy and teenage pregnancy are there because of some irresponsible people and these are parents and elders who look after their children Other problems like poverty and unemployment have to be analysed historically There are more problems now than in the past because socialisation which used to be uh the foremost role of the family was largely taken up by formal education institutions Children are sent to nursery schools as early as four years old As a result the quality of socialisation is different from the close primary and personal relations In addition since the family is no longer the focus of economic activities adult members of the family have uh very little time to spare for the socialisation of children at home Hence the ill-mannered people exist as a result of the failure of the family and other institutions responsible for cultural maintenance to make them conform to culture of their society Social changes on the other hand cause social problems Such changes can be urbanization or industrialization Also social problems are not caused by lazy people because work is not a straightforward solution to poverty One may have a job and be poor Thank you Now this is the end of my presentation and I welcome any contribution and questions", 'subdomain':

{'text': "What are these minority groups which require minority rights and do we have any minority communities in this country The second one probably how far have minority rights been dealt with in international law international convention as well as domestic law and the third question is to what extent did the <name/> report address itself to minority rights in Tanzania and finally I would look at what are the rights of the minorities that require special attention Mr Chairman the concept of minorities is one of those different concepts to define and I dare say so far even in the international fora there is no universally accepted definition of what a minority group or a minority community is and I would say uh whether a given community is a minority or not is not a question of law it is a question of fact Now the nearest definition that I have is the definition given by the international court of justice way back in nineteen thirty when they were giving their opinion on the question or on the dispute between Greek and Bulgarian emigrants and in that opinion which is dated thirty-first of July nineteen thirty the international court of justice said A minority group is a group of persons living in a given country or locality having a race religion language traditions of their own and united by the identity of such race religion language and traditions in a sentiment of solidarity with a view to preserving their traditions maintaining their form of worship securing instruction and upbringing of their children in accordance with the spirit and traditions of their race and mutually assisting one another Now briefly what we see in that definition is that a minority is either an ethnic religious or linguistic or cultural group which is numerically smaller than the rest of the population of the state to which it belongs and which possesses cultural physical or historical characteristics either a religion a language which is different from the rest of the population and it is the difficulties of having a clear-cut concept that has made the question of minority a little bit uh tense and controversial in Africa In fact most of the African countries do not accept that they have what anything called minority communities or minority groups Now in the context of Tanzania my question will be uh do we have minorities and if so which are these minority communities and my question would be have you heard about people called the <name/> <name/> <name/> who in my opinion in my view fall very closely to the definition that is given in this uh international court of justice opinion So it would appear from the definition that in order for there to be a minority in a given state you see the three basic elements are that first that the minority should be a non-dominant group in the population and it should possess a culture a language or a religion which is so specific to itself very much different from the rest of the population and the second characteristic or element would be that the community should be sufficient in number not too small sufficient in number to deserve the preservation of such traditions or characteristics and that that minority should be loyal to the state within which it is living So that sort of definition avoids the question of succession or separation by some communities and so forth Now how far have minority rights been preserved internationally and so forth Formerly this concept and the  conflicts that has that have arisen about minority groups can be seen much more clearer if we look at the history of Europe from right in the seventeenth century up to to date and we hear we still hear a lot of conflict ethnic conflicts and so forth Now I will not go into the history because it is going to take us extremely long but all that I can say in a summary is that if you look at the seventeenth century you will find that the concept of minority rights was very much used to preserve religious minorities against persecution you see so you'll find throughout Europe the concept is being used by those who belong to minorities in terms of religion to try and preserve their religion and in many cases the concept was also used as a pretext by some countries to invade other countries where they felt that religious minorities were not being given the freedom to worship For instance you'll find England intervening in France in sixteen fifty-five uh Holland intervening in France also to protect the so-called Calvinists and Sweden intervening in Poland in seventeen sixty-seven in order to protect Protestants so-called minorities in terms of religion Now coming to the eighteenth century you'll find that several treaties are being concluded in Europe and the concept of minorities is being broadened not only uh being restricted to religious minorities but also to questions of languages the linguistic minorities uh racial minorities and so forth So a number of treaties are being concluded in Europe You have the Treaty of Vienna in eighteen fifteen between Austria and the Netherlands containing special protection for Belgian Catholic ethnic minorities You have the final act of the Congress of Vienna signed in Vienna in eighteen fifteen by Austria France Britain and Portugal and Russia and Sweden where they are trying to safeguard the interests of national minorities particularly the Poles and the Polish language and you have another convention the Treaty of Berlin in July eighteen seventy-eight between Germany Austria Hungary France and Britain and Italy which abolishes religious discrimination and so forth And the story goes on until you come to the twentieth century You have a lot of treaties and conventions to try to protect minorities So coming to the African continent and particularly in Tanzania the first thing that we can note both in terms of the constitution and domestic laws is that there is no recognition in the internal law of the rights of ethnic and linguistic minorities As you remember I said there are minority communities in Tanzania which require special protection and the argument has been that this is the country of people who are equal there are no language *differentiations> and according to the government we cannot distinguish the people of Tanzania by linguistic groups because there are so many linguistic groups and within the bigger linguistic groups if you say the Sukoma you still have some dialects which differ from one Sukoma area to another so you cannot really define the people of Tanzania in those terms That is the government argument and therefore the question of protecting a minority who happen to be in a different linguistic group does not arise but I don't think whether that is true and I as I did say the question of whether you have minorities is really a question of fact and not a question of law Now if we come down to the <name/> report volume two uh where you have the terms of no volume one the terms of <O/> <name/> report which are about seven there is no specific reference giving the commission in the course of its uh deliberations to look or to take into account the rights of minority communities The only reference which is very very ambiguous appears in what the <name/> calls <ea_><O/><ea/> which I consider to be guidelines because there is <ea_><O/><ea/> <Ea_><O/><ea/> is probably terms of reference Then there is <ea_><ea/> which would be some guidelines presidential guidelines to the commission and if you look at paragraph four sub-item five you see there is some mention there that the commission should try to incorporate the views of minority communities that would be my definition but in Kiswahili it simply says <ea_>sentences<ea/> <Ea/><O/> etcetera would include these linguistic communities Probably members of the commission will tell us to what extent did they consult communities like the <name/> and the <name/> to see whether their interests their special interests have been taken care of by the commission because it is my argument that these people belong to very different cultures to very different linguistic  groups and their way of life is very much different from the rest of the population in Tanzania I will give you examples In nineteen seventy-five during the villages and <name/> villages exercise the government attempted to modernise the Sandawe by collecting them in villages establishing schools and teaching them farming And do you know what happened If you go there you'll find schools without children farms without the Sandawe and it is all a relic of a disaster because these people are essentially food gatherers and hunters and that is what all that they know about So to try to modernise them by actually destroying their culture is in fact to more contrary to some of the accepted internationally accepted conventions about the protection of minorities And if you look at the constitution you look at the constitutionRRR in the Bill of Rights article thirteen sub-article one article twenty-one sub-article two and article nineteen sub-article one you see there is

{'text': "<$B> Uh how I started first as a writer <name/> is very interesting because I myself never thought uh much of being a writer but it all came about when I thought I had a lot of time on me and personally as I was in school I was very much interested in literature but that literature interested not making me feel that I wanted to be a writer or I wanted to be uh writing at any one time of my life but somehow uh I found myself in the year of nineteen seventy-six when my husband travelled out of the country with a lot of time and uh I didn't know actually what to do with my time and then I had this idea and the idea in fact it came when I used to listen to the founder of our nation the late Mr Joma Kenyatta and you know talking and I had the desire to write about him and like to imitate his speech but put it in writing and actually my first ever manuscript when I started writing I started writing Mr Jomo Kenyatta's speeches but in my language \n<$B> So although I must confess to date it's not yet published not yet although uh I hope one day it will so that's actually how I got the interest\n<$B> Yes I was married I was working but by the time my husband left for some course abroad I stopped working that was nineteen seventy-six as I said March and I had two workers in the house I had had my first two daughters and I just found everything is done for me uh My children my babies are taken care of and really I didn't know what to do with my time I wasn't working and uh that's how it came about and I must confess I wasn't up today I don't drink uh so in far as socialising my socialising was very minimal Not that I'm not a social person but by then my socialisation with people was very minimal so that's how I found myself having a lot of time to myself \n<$B> I really didn't have special times although I found most of the times that I would concentrate more was in the evenings after the two girls had been put to bed and then the evening would seem like it's very long for me and the evening would start at something like eight o'clock when the babies are asleep and the workers have gone to their quarters and that's the time I would call special because it's then that I would actually concentrate \n<$B> Yes I was inspired as I said earlier by the fact that I loved literature and I used to read books by Kenyan writers and I remember for example I remember there was an old lady uh By now she must be and she's about the first Kenyan writer I read about She was she's called Grace wa Chuma and she wrote a small book in my mother tongue that is Kikuyu and I kind of used to think I can imitate her \n<$B> Yah \n<$B> Charity wa Chuma \n<$B> Yes so she was kind of my I somebody I admired and I thought that uh I would imitate her but write other than in Kikuyu also I would now start thinking of writing in English and I read a lot of uh other novels by non-Kenyans but nevertheless women writers \n<$B> I must admit most of them were from Europe especially Britain and uh I used to love their kind of uh writing and < />thi < />thi it's it was romantic but it's not that you know so deep It's just something as one would say you know normal thing that I kind of those days used to enjoy that kind of you know reading \n<$B> Yes they were available here very much \n<$B> What made me change the language is Okay number one as I've told you this writing of Kikuyu was wanting to write kind of a biography of our late president but I started when he was still alive then I got inspired like uh I can write a fiction a story and having been inspired by that particular lady and \n<$B> Yes I then actually uh started hearing you know people especially women talking about uh things that had happened to them and in this instance I had a friend I still have her as a friend who is actually up to now married to an Asian and she would tell me the problems she had in her marriage and the problems that actually the man went through uh even to a point of being disowned by his family because he is an Asian Here he is he's in love with an African girl and he wants to marry her and at a very tender age when this boy was supposed to be in Standard Four was thrown out from his house from his own brother and this girl was illiterate To date she is uh just now uh reading the the adult literacy classes and they eloped and I found that story very fascinating Here she is she's telling about her life and as we're talking right now <names/> that lady is a grandmother and she has lived happily very happily with her Asian husband because finally the Asian family came to accept the Kikuyu African girl because they didn't have a choice because they saw that really their man or their boy is stuck to this girl so finally they accepted her and she even wedded in their Asian traditional marriage so also that story inspired me and that was my ever novel I wrote \n<$B> <title/> yes \n<$B> Uh I wrote it in English because I must confess you see Kenyans majority of Kenyans especially uh my targeted market is the young people Majority don't know my mother tongue and even though they may be Kikuyus they don't know how to read it and understand it uh Swahili is not very much appreciated in our young people in as far as reading is concerned so uh and I must also confess I may not have been a very good Swahili writer you know and in Kikuyu the readers would be minimal yes \n<$B> Yes \n<$B> Yes it was translated later on \n<$B> Yes \n<$B> Yeah \n<$B> Yes \n<$B> Men women young people uh These are my targeted uh so to speak people because uh my kind of writing like that one was The message there was really both to the young people and to their parents like you as a parent you really may not have much control over your son or your daughter's love affair and maybe the best you can do is counsel her If you think she can't change her mind then I think the best advice is just accept regardless of tribe race or nationality It works it can work and for the young people the message was like if you really feel that this is the man I want or this is the girl I want regardless of race tribe or whatever then there should not be any barrier hindering you from that kind of a marriage and in fact when that book was reviewed in the Kenyan press the reviews were very very very positive you know like uh racial harmony The uh Weekly Review's heading of a review was uh Racial Harmony you know that really it's not the tribe or race that is the problem you can still make it \n<$B> Yes \n<$B> I used my friend's situation to create a story not to discredit her but really to show that it can happen in real life So you see her story it's just that now I kind of elaborated and the only fiction about it is names because you or her place where she came from I have changed uh to suit where best I could close my eyes and just you know figure it out how it could happened but the truth is it's true it's a true story in form of a fiction because it is there \n<$B> That's a question I've always been asked even by the Kenyan media \n<$B> And I can tell you here and now that it was it turned out to be very interesting because first I thought it would be me to pay the publisher or the printer for that matter I had not the slightest idea that I would get a penny out of my writing I thought it would be me to pay so when I first took my manuscript to various publishers in our country I took about two to about two of them two or about three because two uh replied negatively and the only people that were interested in having further discussion on it was Kenyan Literature Bureau When it came to the actual now signing of the agreement it is then they told me about royalties that they even talked about advancing me some money which I \n<$B> I thought well you mean are you serious you know like are you saying I'm going you are the one to pay me Is it not a mistake and I came to realise that I can actually make money out of it which came to completely as a surprise to me I must confess it was a total surprise to me that they were paying me even before they published the book what they were calling advanced royalty and I thought well this is something very nice I'll try again \n<$B> And I have been trying \n<$B> Uh I think it was to my first it was to my satisfaction uh because by my satisfaction I mean I felt happy that I am able to communicate to other people that something like this is possible if you are talking about <title/> I felt kind of pride in me that I am able to tell people that this is possible so it was actually more of my satisfying myself that I can do it and that's why even before I knew I would make money out of it I was even prepared to do it whatever little money I had I would have sacrificed if it had meant that yah \n<$B> No uh if I go back to my schooldays very briefly I was never impressed by poems and I must confess up to now I'm not very I don't understand poems not even now and I happened to have a teacher who was my literature teacher I still remember her name she was Mrs Buchanan and this is I'm talking about the sixties when I did my O levels at <name/> Secondary school and we were doing Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe and Macbeth by Shakespeare and I used to love her talk about Things Fall Apart and I think I created a situation whereby I got so much interested that in her assignment in the story I would miss doing anything else but not that not to get good marks but I enjoyed and I would read that book over and over again and I could see you know that world of I didn't understand now it was world of creative writing but I now see it so I had always <us/>gotten interested in uh stories other than poems and for that matter I wasn't interested in short stories that you can read you know a short story in five minutes then you go to another story and then you go to another story I wasn't really keen on that I wanted to read a whole you know novel That interested me I would want to see the beginning and the middle and the end of the story in its length full length \n<$B> Uh after starting in nineteen maybe seventy-six it may have taken me to write the novel itself maybe uh three years or so because you see then I would of course get lost somehow now what did I want to say about this so it was like little by little and as I I<_/> have told you I had not this urge in me that I didn't know I was going to make Maybe if I knew I was going to make a cent out of it it would have improved my speed", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$B> We may agree that the patriarchal societies I mean they are the same They are structured according to structure education work <O/> but we find that the problems women face right in Kenya are totally different In fact it will also depend on the community you come from A Swahili woman will not face the same problems as a Kikuyu woman would face You see the image of a woman in Kikuyuland is different from the image of a woman in Swahili land\n<$B> Yeah I'm Kikuyu\n<$B> Yah that's what I'm saying\n<$B> Something peculiar although mostly the Swahili you know has been influenced so much by the Arab image the Islam religion that the woman should not work a woman should just stay in the house be a symbol something beautiful something to be adored by the man that kind of thing but on the other hand you come to Kikuyuland to the Bantu tribes you find that the woman is a beast of burden The man is just a figurehead there You work in the farms you look after the cows you look after the children you look after everything\n<$B> Yah and in fact some of the money you accrue from your work he uses it as a dowry <O/> to get a second wife see \n<$B> Yah even another wife\n<$B> Yes then you are supposed to submit to that kind of thing\n<$B> Yes in fact in some cases apart from our generation now who are refusing that they are not going to be used for that kind of purpose although what they do the men just walk away in protest from you and they go sort of to someone else\n<$B> No in our area they don't call it divorce as such They will just separate from you and go and start a completely new life as if you didn't exist You are still in the group of the women to look after but of course he's not looking after you like giving you economical independence You just bear his name There's nothing else he's going to do for you So what I'm arguing is that the problems will be different You might be worrying that your husband or your boyfriend may not be interested in helping you in the house We are worried that they can't even help us in the farms We become economical assets to them anyway because they are going to use you as economical agents They are going to accrue wealth using you but not appreciate your effort For example I may give an example of a woman who will look after the coffee and she'll get all the money from that coffee but the account is in the man's name so any time the money is being taken the man will come and go back with it to the city and of course spend it with whichever you know women he wants and you are left there with your children suffering \n<$B> They are but the traditional set up of the rules and the traditional cultures we grew in determine a lot what kind of image you get For example you go and accuse your husband at the police station that he has beaten you and they will dismiss it as a domestic affair Nobody will raise a finger even now even in the streets even in a bar you can be beaten and nobody will raise a finger\n<$B> You have a right but you will be beaten yah So you find that there is a lot of contradiction between what is in the laws and what is practised \n<$B> Well they are doing a lot For example we have formed a lot of lobby groups We have like the Fida the group of women lawyers who are taking up all the cases of women who are battered abused \n<$B> Women who are separated raped and that kind of thing We also have people who are just <O/> insinuations against women For example a politician would stand up and say This man is so useless that we are going to replace him with a woman You see when you are useless you can only be compared to a woman You know that kind of linguistic insinuation Then they'll say leave them they are behaving like pregnant women\n<$B> They are behaving like pregnant women who make noise for nine months and after that period of course and so forth then they go back to normal which means the period of gestation is being looked as a kind of madness where a woman is not responsible for what happens you know to her life That kind of insinuation is the kind of thing they are saying That is still very entrenched in our roots in our culture You compare somebody like a woman you know looking for a man a prostitute there are then politicians are behaving the political parties they are behaving like prostitutes who aren't allowed in hotels You know you see these kind of linguistic insinuations act a lot on the woman question Even women ourselves will tell you stop behaving like a woman you know And I'll use it myself \n<$B> Yah what I'm saying is that whatever culture brought you up has been entrenched in you so much that even when it's against you as a person you don't realise \n<$B> Well it has changed but I still think we have a long way to go before we can reach that level where we can argue that the woman question in society has changed You see we are still we still believe women form a social class of their own and they are supposed to be treated in a particular way such that it doesn't matter at whatever level you are even if you are a university professor and another one is just a village housewife Your husband will see you both They don't see that the kind of education you have acquired has enlightened you to refuse some of these traditional set-ups for you You see I even have a case which got us very much bitter of a mother-in-law who had her daughter-in-law circumcised after five births You know She insists that this woman cannot live in my compound because she's not \n<$B> She was already married and she was there with her five children \n<$B> She must have been in thirties in her late thirties I remember it was in the press \n<$B> The husband was a party because they believed that a woman unless circumcised \n<$B> She's is not complete you see \n<$B> Yah that is why I'm telling you the roots which reared you are still so much entrenched in you that it doesn't matter what you have undergone you might not have changed ideas you see I'll still believe a woman is not complete until she gets this kind of she gets circumcised\n<$B> Okay \n<$B> Yeah Charity wa Chuma \n<$B> Okay \n<$B> Yah in fact it was during the colonial era in the fifties Around nineteen fifty-two Even before that we had splinter groups Those who had been bought by colonialism assuming the Christian kind of religion and they believed circumcision was evil but we still had a splinter group which up to today do it you know the Kikuyu are doing it Meru are doing it even Kisii still feels that circumcision is right you see so it would depend on what school of thought you are following as an individual \n<$B> Well I think well under the majority now because Christianity has almost taken root in most parts of the country Yah and those who do it will do it secretly because if you are I mean if you are found out that you are circumcising your daughter they will ostracise you from the Church You will be excommunicated but it is still practised and uh I still know my relatives my own relatives who are supposedly Christians but they still take their daughters Now they take them either to hospitals or to other places where they can do it without the community to know what you are doing So it will depend on whether you believe in it or you don't believe in it \n<$B> I'm saying I'm in both Because in our department we teach both I'm in the Swahili department We teach Swahili literature and that's why we call it ourselves the Department of Swahili and other African languages So we are interested in the literatures of the people and their language So you find that I'm interested in the Kikuyu language I'm interested in the literature also For my M A I did women question how the image has changed in historical periods and for my PhD now I want to do all literature I want to look at women in the traditional image in the images which come up in the genres of all literature to see how <O/> the images we have in our society today \n<$B> I looked at three historical periods before colonialism came in colonialism during the time of colonialism and independent era For before colonialism well that is why I <O/> my current work I looked at a book I mean a play a poem written by a woman lady She was giving her daughter some kind of advice \n<$B> Okay but you can understand the message \n<$B> So this woman is advising her daughter on how she's going to behave towards her husband so that she can lead a happy life after that She told her you must look after his health You cook for him You bathe him You are You massage him You do all sorts of things and then for yourself you have to look like a flower So you massage yourself also You make up your face that kind of thing And then when he tells you something you should never answer back You should take it because your husband is going to be instrumental on whether you go to hell or heaven If he says you go to hell that's where you go \n<$B> If he says you go to heaven you go So you are here It's sort of she's advising her that she's of lower intellect and she has to be guided by the man And that's actually what we have in our African cultures Men believe women should be looked at as children and that's what they believed <Name/> has written a paper Maybe I should give you a copy She was doing a comparative study between the Maasais and encouraging the women questioning I think in analogies And she was saying that women believe actually they are like children and actually when a Maasai man or a Kalenjin man is counting his children he will include his wife in the number So when he tells you he has five children he means \n<$B> Yes he'll not say the wife he'll say five children you see so the wife is included in that \n<$B> Not necessarily age It's because they believe you have to treat them bad the way you treat a child you have to guide her You have to you know check up on them and that sort of thing still with women I think that is what we have in most societies anyway They don't call you children as such but the way they treat you that you have to be physically beaten when you do something wrong to be corrected you see the kind of you the kind of thing you'd do to a child When a child does something wrong you believe to correct that behaviour you have to beat him and that's actually the equivalent threat in most African societies So I was arguing that in that stage the woman is perpetuating the need that the woman is inferior to the man and she has to continue being an appendage to the man if she is to survive That was during before colonialism With the coming of colonialism things changed a lot The men were taken to the forest The women were left alone They had to start doing the roles which were traditionally male roles", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '49d38395-21b7-4b73-af75-63d8a87fdf70', 'added':

{'text': "<$B> Okay I was very interested in listening to stories when I was young and uh when I did my uh college education here before I went to Britain to graduate I wrote a few stories which were very much recommended by the tutor who was uh supervising my dissertation uh I think I put down about fifty stories at that time which were very much appreciated even by members of uh my group and I was asked to read quite a number of them every time we had children's literature lessons I did not think at that time that I really wanted to make a book so I moved with them to Britain when I got a chance of going for further education and uh when I was asked to think about what I wanted to do for my dissertation again I just chose stories And I sent back home for more of the ones I left behind to be sent to me And actually I worked on a small book which I'm still keeping in my house which I typed myself I had learned how to type when I was in Britain I typed these on stencils and I produced a small book and my tutor was also very very impressed and in fact uh asked if I could uh leave some of those copies with him and find a way of publishing them I didn't think much about them at that time I came back and again I was offered another scholarship here at the University of Nairobi And uh although this time uh my dissertation was not on children's writing I kept on translating more and more stories until one day uh one of the directors of a publishing house at that time East African Publishing House uh asked me to go and see him with uh my stories because I think he had heard about them So I took the file and uh he looked through them and said why don't we sit down and select some of these stories and publish them So I was really grateful that somebody recognised uh my work and he took out the file and did a selection and then we got together and we selected stories together and grouped them into three groups One set we called <title/> Another set we called <title/> and another we called <title/> and that is how the first set of first three sets of books came into being uh I think at that time as far as I remember they said I was one of the first African writers of children's books It's a pity that I didn't follow this up very much until after about ten years I came to ask about my file and again selected a few stories which uh gave me another title <title/>\n<$B> Well that's strange I think in every African village and I grew up in a village uh in the evenings normally uh mothers uh told stories to their children particularly girls and we used to gather around my mum who was very fond of telling stories and she told us a number of stories And some I remembered at the time I was doing this at college but at that time she was still alive and I used to go back to her to tell the stories so that I can improve on them So a number of the stories I could remember the titles and uh a little bit about them but she perfected them when I started seriously uh writing them down So that is how I actually got uh to write the stories but again I was also interested in telling stories and most of the time after I'd been told stories I would gather other children maybe the following day or a week later and tell the same stories to other children In fact my mother used to say that I couldn't do anything but teach because even with other things singing and all that I used to get children together then just teach them songs and uh stories again If I was told a story I also went out and gathered other children and told them stories \n<$B> Yeah that's right and uh I didn't visit my grandmother so very much because I started schooling when I was still very young and went into a boarding school when I was young But during the holidays I used to visit my grandmother and she also told very interesting stories which I also used to tell again to others So it was both my mum and uh my grandmother \n<$B> Children yes \n<$B> Oh the villagers' \n<$B> Yes neighbours' Yeah We lived in a small community Yeah And in fact every afternoon I think it happens in every community you know boys uh play football and all that And girls would gather and play games of various kinds Before we parted you know I used to tell stories Mainly in the evening after we had fetched water and uh firewood and things like that because by then we didn't have tap water and charcoal was not very easy to come by So we used to go collecting firewood and fetching water and in the evenings then we would sit down and uh I would tell stories or we'd play games \n<$B> I enjoyed telling stories and I enjoyed sharing you know what I had with others \n<$B> Because mainly you know my mum used to sit after we had It is like you know recreation When everything else is done you sit down and then you recreate So it for her you know that was the time she got us and we sat round and she'd just tell stories to us as her children Yeah Then I thought it would be good also to share these with others I haven't up to now asked them whether their mums also told them stories but they used to enjoy you know listening to me telling them stories \n<$B> In most of the\n<$B> Yeah It's very interesting There's not one story that has no song So most of the time when I told stories there were songs I could sing it once and then they join \n<$B> Yes In between Yeah \n<$B> Most of the time in between and if you look at my books it was very difficult to put these songs as they were and since these were being edited for a particular group of children we sometimes used to distort them by trying to make them rhyme and all that It doesn't come the same way and I can't even sing them the way I've written them then But if you saw the manuscript in my language then they were written the same way we sang them \n<$B> Luo \n<$B> Most of the time it is not for them to respond but when you come to that it's like a chorus Everybody joins in \n<$B> No They still sing they still sing Most of the stories have those songs Very very few stories you'll find without songs They have songs \n<$B> Yeah \n<$B> Yeah In the rural areas \n<$B> I did a lot of that I think it's only my last daughter who missed Maybe I was getting too much involved because uh I had her when I was preparing for the Women's Decade I didn't have the time but I know that my husband even got books to read to her you know if I couldn't tell the stories but the first two really heard stories told by me \n<$B> No Not the responses No I just told the stories the same way I used to tell them \n<$B> Yes \n<$B> Yeah And then they got translated \n<$B> No That one I would do now I didn't do it at all You know the stories were just being told for enjoyment \n<$B> They have messages but we really did not you know discuss that mainly for  enjoyment\n<$B> Yeah Yes I think I would say that \n<$B> No stories are not grouped Not even for you know not even age because you know the I would respond the same way you know my daughter or somebody else would respond to the same the same stories I I've never you know had you know grouping in telling stories but of course when you come to schools you know sometimes the like the stories I wrote would be given to primary school but I find that you know grown-ups enjoy those stories just as much as children yeah So in my mind I've never had to write stories for a you know specific or tell stories for a specific group of children yeah \n<$B> No \n<$B> Yeah \n<$B> Yes Yeah that's what it is \n<$B> Yeah \n<$B> I wish I had the books with me but I think every story has got a some implication yeah except that at the end of my stories now if I'd to write them then I would ask questions you know how they react to every bit of story But like one of the stories I think in <title/> there was this old man you know who used to go begging particularly on market days and uh he made use of the seeds you know by drying and then later on planting them along the roads you know So that the seeds then produced you know fruits and these fruits were really enjoyed by many people And uh children should see that you know as something that is somebody who is not very very rich you know uh caring for other people yeah that kind of implication in that particular story \n<$B> As I said every story has got something to teach yeah either morally or otherwise So at the end I would ask just how they you know how they themselves even see themselves in that <->in thatRRR story \n<$B> \n<$B> No Mine ends they all kind of have a conclusion \n<$B> Yeah yeah In fact most of the stories end with this word <ea/>tinda That means that is the end It's like Amen when you finish a prayer \n<$B> <ea/>Tinda It is Luo yes \n<$B> No my particular stories are still the same Yeah but if you listen to other people you know They try to have stories march with the time But if we have to keep our oral tradition really you know the stories should be kept the way they were told So I don't see much particularly for my stories changing People may want to but I don't think I will encourage that Yeah They should remain just the way they were \n<$B> Yeah uh you know oral uh literature is being encouraged And uh it is to transfer really the said to written And that should not be distorted really It should be put just the way it is Just the way I say it \n<$B> Yeah It is true that uh we're at the moment thinking very much about gender issues and uh even there is an inclination of you know changing some of the stories so that uh they don't uh look as if you know that one side was suffering So that uh I would call it maybe gender neutral So that we balance you know whatever you put in writing This might not you know affect the stories so very much maybe it's those who are doing creative writing but if you take most of the stories and analyse it particularly with the students maybe you could just find one or two gender disparities And uh I think that maybe the new writers who are doing creative writing who would be the ones that who'd see to it that uh gender sensitivity you know is not lost in the in telling stories or creating stories \n<$B> I think that you know the maybe the authors will have to sit down and just see ways in which they can change their writing So that we don't just do it abruptly like that It must take you know it must be a gradual process you know changing the way we have heard the stories and have them written without distorting them \n<$B> Now I personally feel that it is not going to be very difficult for me I would not really interfere with the stories that have already been written but I would take up whatever new uh writing you know I would be doing to be more gender neutral", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$B> Well yah because I have these memories living with my grandfather who was a very very old man and I remember he used we used to go there to be sent there to cultivate by my parents you know We had a piece of land there it was about was aboutRRR fifteen kilometres away from home So I had the chance of living in a round thatched hut where everything took place there cooking The fire-place is there My grandfather is there In the evening he would be telling us stories because he was a warrior my grandfather He had been fighting \n\n<$B> Yah When he was a young man he was a warrior In fact he had a big dent here and he had a nickname because of the dent This dent he got fighting with the Maasai You know the Kikuyus and the Maasais they used to have tribal wars and he used to go fighting and even brought a wife from Maasailand So he used to tell us all these stories about fighting with the Maasais all kinds of things and I was so fascinated You know there was no light there was nothing The fire would be small dying there in the middle of the It was so wonderful And then during the day there were those girls you know we used to call them they used to wear these calico sheets you know not modern dress tribal traditional And we would go collecting firewood In fact you know in <title/> there is a place where I'm talking about insects you know You somebody's saying you take a heap of insects like this you go around your head seven times This is something I did I went there with that girl in the forest to collect firewood and she showed me all these <O/> these black insects you know a heap like this and she said you know if you do this take some go around your head like this you always find luck on your way And you know these things we were doing: if my mother knew being a Christian she would have been so disappointed So that's why you know people think uh There was one girl who read my <title/> I was saying and she told me you know what people are saying the person who has written this book must know a lot about witchcraft She must you know a lot about witchcraft She cannot be a Christian I said Why those things there Okay Anyway they wondered how I was brought up in uh a very very Christian background my mother my father You know in fact my mother was an evangelist She's remembered because she really was wonderful when she went out preaching She was an orator And if she stood to pray they would all be moved She was very very highly gifted in that light So with us we were supposed to be going to church We were not supposed in fact to know all these traditional songs You know there are songs during circumcision during whatever during weddings all those songs \n\n<$B> No not at all In fact even today whenever we go to my village where I was born It's not far away from Nairobi It's about fifteen kilometres but it's on Limuru Road going to Limuru Now whenever we go there there's a small river That brings nostalgic memories because at that small river that's where circumcision took place and our house was right up somewhere and you could look out through the window Very early in the morning when we knew that there was circumcision going we woke up very early in the morning to look through the window to see those people going and listening to the songs And if my mother knew we were even looking out We would get into trouble And then I remember one of the girls in the village got circumcised and you know after the circumcision of course they wear these calico sheets and they have a lot of safety pins all along and somebody puts five cent coins all along and they go about you know looking happy and we were somehow envious about that kind of the group you know We were not We were outsiders and I don't know what happened I think we thought one of them was being so conceited we beat her up me and my sisters and when my mother heard that we had beaten up this girl we had to hide in the banana plantation at night because we were going to be beaten up Okay Then at school in the primary school there were those girls who were circumcised Very few of us were not And one teacher I remember this story very well one of the teachers a woman teacher who was circumcised wanted us to be beaten up the girls who were not circumcised So she called the whole class all the girls from that class where we were to come outside and they made a big circle and we were called in the middle There were four of us and they were now saying these girls have been abusing the others what what what and they wanted to beat us And you know they did not beat us because we ran away We understood what was happening and we just ran away So in fact during my childhood everywhere you went they knew you had not been circumcised And they called you names \n\n<$B> No well I'm now going talking about even in the village the people If you went about everywhere you were walking and people knew you were not circumcised they would call you names I remember being called a European a what a what So it's like we were so insecure because of that and\n\n<$B> In that village you know you counted the Christian families It's about ten ten families So and my mother of course they did not want the parents did not want us to mix with those who were because they were called uncivilised what what It was hard But somehow I made it up because me going to my grandfather's house I learnt a great deal from those women I learnt all the songs And I remember one day my auntie We were cultivating and we were singing those songs as we cultivated those traditional those songs that we were not supposed to sing We were just singing singing And then we stood up and who is in front my auntie And she was just looking And she says she couldn't talk because now being coming from a Christian family and this is what you are doing Anyway that was life at that time \n\n<$B> You know this novel like now I've told you my own grandfather he's a man I respected very much I was small here he was living a very very traditional life and my grandfather he had his patch of land He was cultivating He was growing maize and I will never forget the kind of maize he grew and the kind you could sit on that ground it was so clean not a wheat not any not a wheat it was clean It was like in a park You could lie down there I used to lie down whenever we went I'd look at the clouds clouds clouds going round It was so beautiful And you know he would crawl on the land cultivating even at that old age So he inspired me so much And then what inspired me is that my mother who was a Christian had no conflict with him And I remember my grandfather was asking my mother one day Why do you send these girls to school Why do you want them educated She said well they have to be educated And then my mother would ask my grandfather I remember Why do you go about cheating people that you can heal them Because now he became a medicine man And my grandfather I will never forget the answer he gave my mother I was there and he said let those who want to be cheated be cheated He was not going to argue saying it's a good thing or what They respected one another My mother respected my grandfather you know her father And then my grand respected her although they were they had they held different ideas ideology about My grandfather was very much a traditional man and in fact every morning before he got out of his house he would call a small boy one of his sons because he had many wives One of the those little boys would come to the house first That boy had to come to the house first before anybody else came so that you know there was uh happiness luck whatever So that's where really I saw traditional life Of course that's my grandfather Now where I was born nearby there was a pool a pool of water and you know I don't like being inside the water I fear water You know water that has collected I fear And you know this pool around it were big big bushes You know it was so mysterious and there were these little paths you know leading to this place \n\n<$B> Yah there were animals going there to drink And this pool looked so mysterious to me when I was a small child so I think that one also because I saw it in my childhood and all these things I have written you know in the some of them you know I think is what I was inspired when I was a small child going to my grandfather's and also where I lived Now this other one bringing <name/> in of course that one is interesting also because there was uh a woman in my village She was married to my uncle you know step-uncle This was the most conceited woman I have ever seen I remember one day her her the mother of her her mother-in-law Her mother- in-law was traditional but this woman because her husband was a clinical officer he was working at the hospital and he was quite advanced at that age at that time This woman was so proud she was so beautiful but she was so so proud My house my parents' house were like here and theirs were like that one being back there next door Now her uh sister-in-law is it sister-in-law Yes came to visit one day They came from far away with some friends to visit Do you know this woman refused to allow them inside the house because she thought they are very dirty they are what they are what And we had to go there get them and put them in our house You know that thing got into my head I said no I can't stand this kind of thing looking down upon people because they are poor they are not what So my <name/> somehow you know I had that feeling of this woman who troubled my head all the time So that's how it was a lot \n\n<$B> Yah you know also when I was writing you know I as I was writing that novel I had a lot of problems within myself And in fact I remember I was weeping sometimes as I was writing that time I was weeping weeping weeping So I don't know but maybe the reflection of what I was feeling at that time I don't know \n\n<$B> Yah at that time I was having a lot of problems with my husband and this feeling of wanting to be free and I'm not allowed to be free and I was feeling it very strongly at that time And in order to forget I had to wake up There are times I couldn't sleep I was just writing this book so\n<$B> I did not identify with <name/>", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$B> An anthology of ten short stories They are mainly about women I like a particular one here very much here Usually it is the rapist who is killed but in this case the woman uh who was going to be raped actually managed to kill the rapist \n<$B> Yes So I don't know how I did it but maybe I liked the story It's called It's just called <title/> I have it here <title/> and other stories And then the other story here <title/> My people are polygamists the Luos and it appears that this man has got uh uh five six wives and he is going to marry another one and the youngest feels that he shouldn't marry another wife so she goes to someone a counsellor \n<$B> Not a healer but uh somebody yah he's a healer he's a medicine man He gives love potion so the woman goes and tells him uh she's unhappy because her husband is going to marry another wife She's been the youngest and the most loved and she wants that position to continue So he gives the woman this woman some medicine some ash and it appears that the man the medicine man has a grudge against the woman's husband because the woman's husband lured one of his wives from him So instead of giving the pure love ash he gives something very potent So the woman goes and follows his instructions and puts it in his in the husband's gruel and the husband drinks and dies immediately And the wife also manages I don't know how but some of the poison gets into her and she was expectant and she also dies It's you know it has one of those but you can't say it is something which used to happen It happens here not only among the Luos most African women \n<$B> It's still happening Most African women believe that you can get love potion \n<$B> <title/>\n<$B> <title/> have you read <title/>\n<$B> And <title/>\n<$B> I have a good one called <title/>\n<$B> What was happening before the white man came \n<$B> Uh Of course we you have to develop and then again also I think the time has come when the African woman needs to now what would I say Yes we also have to change We cannot stay in that situation where <title/> was That was our way of living That was the time I wanted at least those who were non-Africans to know what it was before the white man came that we were very human with all that love and you know jealousies and so on greed for power people fighting uncle fighting uh nephew and so on But now in this situation also how are the young girls going to handle it you know Like I tell them also always in my writing we have to uh tell the children read write about our own stories But we also have to tell the children about the current \n<$B> Yah because as I was saying that some of our traditions were very aggressive especially to the woman and now with all this development we cannot just let them be because they are our customs I tell them as we are growing as we develop we must discard some of the aggressive customs and only carry on with what is good And you know <name/> somebody said if I knew a woman called <name/> but I didn't know anybody It was just my imagination I've never known anybody with that problem but you know you always take bits and pieces from your society and put it up you know uh and create something out of it So I thought because there are several young girls who find themselves in this situation it may be that after independence with all this freedom and so on some of our men became very irresponsible So you find that a woman actually goes through what <name/>'s mother went through And now that was the mother now if <name/> finds herself in that situation how should she handle it you know so I was not teaching someone but I was just saying your mother was you know very passive about you are you also going to be passive about it or are you going to try and you know be different because these are different situations you're not in the same situation You probably had more education and more exposure than your mother and that's what I was trying to say \n<$B> Yah but even in <title/> you see that old grandmother was very strong and very positive She sort of you know uh ruled the island behind the scenes isn't it Yeah You remember I don't know Maybe you read it too long ago \n<$B> Yah but so my women characters are usually very strong and very positive like in <title/> the young woman also is forced to marry the father's business partner and she goes along with everything until the wedding day Then she elopes with her boyfriend and they fly to America something like that You know that I remember when I was very young my mother told me a story of a girl who was being forced to marry someone and she actually waited and never appeared The husband went to The bridegroom went to church and the bride never appeared And this always fascinated me So I created made it modern and created this story for me Yah \n<$B> <slang/>'Cause I think we our women are very strong usually They are very strong In fact uh uh there are hardly because even the witches are strong That's why they have that power to change things or to sort of rule people with their power and the medicine and so on But I think that the women are strong but we usually like to play it down yah \n<$B> Yah even in daily life Because in most places like we know that in African villages it's the women who are feeding the nation especially like in Kenya here People like my mother my mother-in-law they you know they dig in their patches of land and collectively this is bought and is taken to the Maize and Produce and this happens in almost every community of every African country But even in homes I think if the women were not strong there wouldn't be many African homes Not that the men are weak but women play a very you know \n<$B> essential part Yah In daily life Yah Sort of you know seeing what are people going to eat and so on And that's why I say our emancipation and our women liberation and yours cannot be the same because the African woman has got a lot of responsibility She sort of goes out looking for food while you stay at home and the man goes out to work but the African woman is responsible for feeding the household you know for the well-being of the household to see who is sick who is lacking something who is you know and so on and so forth So I think that's just being unfair to the women that when we portray them we tend to make them weak and weak and weaker This is not the case really \n<$B> No not anymore and of course it also depends on the various ethnic groups because uh it is what the society wanted the woman to be That you cannot be you know if you are a woman with no sons then you have let the society down you have let your husband down So if you are a woman they always either have to get a brother to be on the background somewhere to support you or an uncle or a cousin Just that women are just regarded as nothing \n<$B> <name/> \n<$B> <title/> is here fully It's printed fully There they cut some bits away \n<$B> Because she's very young yah \n<$B> But because the man is so much older The man is so old She is only sixteen and the man could be forty something or going fifty and then it is a forced marriage <name/> uh What is her name she is called <name/> <name/> is going to school and <name/> knows what she wants but the uh her husband is treating her just as he has always treated his other wives who were brought to him \n<$B> No no they're not \n<$B> No he says when they're quarrelling the day <name/> goes he says I wanted you to come and live with me but you said you wanted it yourself So you cannot blame me for neglecting you It was her choice \n<$B> Maybe the way they are being portrayed Yes \n<$B> Yah it was also because you see they even when they say women don't make decisions but there came a time when the men were meeting and there's something very difficult they have to make a choice so one of them would say let us go and sleep on this and ask our *hairdress> and the *hairdress> were always the women So in a way the women also had you know a psychological influence on all these things but rather quiet behind the scenes but there are cases in which when they could come out and say I'm sorry this is not what I want to do I don't think this is right Like when the uncle Dima's uncle wants her to go and get married and she says I don't want him to look after me because we are not friends You were allowed to do that because it was a very close relationship and you could only he could only look after you if you were friends Yah So there were areas in which it was allowed There were areas in which it was allowed like <title/> Later on when the man uh wants to take the cows and so on uh A widow's you know step-son has always had a lot of powers over their step-mothers but there came a time when a woman can say I'm sorry I need that cow Don't take it and so on Even you can always speak out Women always spoke out but they were always beaten physical violence in most cases yah because you have no right you are just a woman If you are making a choice which goes against the man you're always judged as being stubborn and you might end up having an arm broken or something like that yah \n<$B> He fell down yah He had a fit yes\n<$B> Not really because that is what it used to be but if things have changed and the men and the society still want to be that in this changed situation then maybe it won't work So I think that's just why I've taken <name/> for her to make choices to see what is right you know That uh you see in the traditional society a daughter-in-law always looked after her mother-in-law It was expected of her to do it But in <name/> she chooses it herself Not because the society expects her to do it but because she has just one child she falls sick they have become friends and now she has to choose either to leave her or out of choice look after her not because The society of course also expects her to do it but they would have excused her because she's very young she's just married and then she's she doesn't belong to the village you know The villagers are wondering what she's doing there you know remaining when she should be with her husband She's been to school She's not one of the village girls \n<$B> Not in all cases no \n<$B> It's a generalisation But I know some even for wives where there is so much solidarity that they end up beating the husband up thoroughly Yah there are cases in which \n<$B> Yah in polygamist marriage but even in some homes Usually the mother-in- law of course there is this myth about the mother-in-law that she is always evil always jealous of her son and so on but of the wives rather of her son but uh there are areas in which they are co-operating quite well",

{'text': "<$B> It was uh actually late sixties when I was in Form Six but before that I had written I actually started writing when I was Primary Six not for publication but I say I wrote because I still have my composition book in primary six and I still enjoy the compositions I wrote the narratives and also my children when I give them I they enjoy those stories and in secondary school when I was studying for my O level when I was in Form Two I was approached through my sister by a British lady who was teaching in uh one of the colleges in one of the primary colleges in the country to write stories and she told us she would publish the stories and so we cracked our heads my sister and myself and a brother and we came up with the stories I remember I wrote about four and we gave them to my sister to take to the lady but unfortunately that is the last we heard about the stories \n<$B> She took them up to now we don't know what happened to those stories but I kept the interest and when I was in when I went for my A levels Form Five and Six I found myself with a lot of time because I went to what was referred to as High Courses Schools Those are schools which had been started for white children only during colonialism and we were actually among the first applicants to go to such schools So they had a lot of programmes for outings and so forth but you could not go out unless you were picked by a car and my father was about one hundred and seventy kilometres from the school He did not own a car so most of the times I was in the school and I did not know how to spend the time and that's when I thought that I should actually write so that I don't get bored by staying in the school and what I actually wrote about I would say is not my own experiences but I was enacting the experiences of my father and mother because uh my mother and father used to tell me a lot of stories particularly my father \n<$B> Yah but not those folk tales My father never told me a single folk tale but he used to tell me about his own experiences as a young man the in the tribal wars between the Kikuyus and the Maasais because his own father had died during one of those intertribal wars So he had actually fresh memories and he kept on retelling the stories and also his experiences during the First World War The Africans were actually recruited to fight in the First World War but he was an only son and my mother was quite scared \n<$B> So all the tricks she used and they used \n<$B> He used to relate them to me and he so there are so they became so fresh to me like my own they became like my own experiences because they were repeated once and again every time I was at home and these are the experiences I wrote about <title/> is actually the experiences of my father and mother re-enacted by their daughter \n<$B> She was a My mother was purely a Kikuyu but there were a lot of things I wanted to clarify from her particularly the women in their relationships with the men the place of women in the society some of their traditional practices regarding women which I was not sure of \n<$B> Not so much of that In the book we see there is such an episode where the Kikuyu men are invaded by the Maasai trying to get some cattle but that is just a highlight to show where the fears of this <O/> about the Maasai is from but <title/> actually is about the Kikuyu social set-up and the place of the children and the women in the social environment where it comes out that the women and the children are were actually underprivileged in a way \n<$B> They did not have a lot of rights a lot of say in the society because it was a male dominated world but towards the end of the book the woman is glorified because there she becomes although she's not the main character in a way she becomes a hero because she starts a maternal family whereas we know that in Kikuyu society we are paternal families So this is why I called the book <title/> because it is the one of the women in Kenya who is said to <O/> Kikuyu society as portrayed in that book to liberate herself from male domination in the society \n<$B> No no They did not know what I was writing because none of them went to school None of my parents went to school but they valued education a lot That is why they saw to it I was educated so actually they don't know what I wrote \n<$B> Kikuyu Yes They don't even know \n<$B> They don't My father passed away nineteen seventy-five but uh my mother they don't know how to read or write either in Kikuyu or \n<$B> I don't think that was they were not bothered You see such parents the world of books is so alien to them They just want you to go to school but they don't know what you are doing and they are not interesting interested in a way They may be interested but to them it is so distant from them So they did not bother to ask me what I was \n<$B> First of all uh the story-telling I think it is a great tool in developing other storytellers and in my context I had to write because I did not have a situation where I could become an oral storyteller and also when I was in Standard Six we had a very good teacher I think that one also stimulated me a lot because every thing every event he could *resee> it he could re-enact it in form uh story form Every small event he could retell it in form a of a story now because of all the stories I had gathered from my parents I think this is what stimulated me and uh what I found when I was doing my dissertation on reading literature to stimulate creative writing in Kenyan secondary schools is that in order to develop writers we need to experience the young children to a lot of good writing because I think when you are exposed to a lot of stories there is that drive and even in the traditional set-up those who became storytellers normally uh were acquainted or in a way they grew up in a society or in a family where there were storytellers You get initiated It is a process you have to get initiated into it \n<$B> Yah \n<$B> Not really because when I wrote it I'd just done oral literature and at that time I wouldn't say it was so structured into literary criticism as it is now We were mainly It was mainly geared to ask the appreciation of the story and in Form Five and Six I never did any literature So in my mind I did not have any structure or plot and the and so on and language form neither did I know for what audience I was writing I believe I didn't know the message but there was a story to be told I was just telling a story \n<$B> Now \n<$B> Now But at that time that timeRRR I did not know what the theme was but there was a story to be told but now I see the context because I can relate now gender issues to the book which I did not actually know about at that time \n<$B> Yes as it was \n<$B> As I see it now but I was just retelling re-enacting a story \n<$B> At that time I did not think in those terms \n<$B> In school yah \n<$B> Maybe it was most spontaneous for me to write in English because during most days and even now the mother tongues because we have so many I think over forty The mother tongue is only taught in the lower primary up to Standard Four and so when you are writing particularly when you are in your school I think the language you are using uh in your school work is the one which is more spontaneous I never thought about which language to use I think it is because as I was I was usingRRR it in school and you'll find that most mostly Kenyans will write in English probably I don't know whether they think about the market because at that time when I wrote <title/> I did not know about things about the market how the language governs the market but I just found myself writing in English \n<$B> Well what happened is when I finished Form Six I had already completed the book I took it one of the publishers \n<$B> East African Publishing House It has closed down now \n<$B> Yah They returned the manuscript I think it was a bit discouraging without uh comments Then I gave it to uh when I went to the university when I was in first year one of my lecturers was a British <name/> I gave him the book and he liked it and he took it to Kenya Literature Bureau but uh when he went away and he had no time to follow it they returned it to me They said the plot is not fine enough something vague at that time Maybe now if I kept the notes I would know I would understand but at that time I did not understand what they were talking about so now I thought what was I going to do with this work and that's like I gathered courage and I gave it to <name/> and as he says in the introduction he liked the book He took it back to Kenya Literature Bureau and they said they don't understand it they don't understand the book So can he write the introduction They wouldn't publish it Normally novels you don't write an introduction \n<$B> But the editors said they don't understand it Unless he writes he commits himself by writing an introduction they wouldn't publish it and that is why he wrote a very long introduction to convince them the book should be published \n<$B> At that time \n<$B> I thought it was because I was an inexperienced writer probably I thought it was because I was  inexperienced because I a high school student writing a novel She wants it published who has never been heard before I think it is because of inexperience and then I'd say probably publishers maybe discourage some potential authors by returning manuscripts without comments or with vague very vague comments which they which discourage the authors because if <name/> had not pushed it maybe I would not have written the other stories I've written I would have become very discouraged and then forget about it \n<$B> Readers \n<$B> It has never been reviewed What the only publicity there's been is by Kenya Literature Bureau itself by writing it as one of the titles in the seventies as one of the many titles in the seventies but it has never been reviewed as such and the only feedback I got is from a Ugandan who said he liked the book a lot after he had read it and he there was a time the Ugandans I don't know whether it was Minister of Education wanted to buy all the copies which were in stock then but I think there was a problem with the currency so the books were not sold \n<$B> I think when I went to the university after O Level after A Levels I got interested in literature because I had completed that book and I thought maybe I would be a better author if I did literature So I I took up literature at the university although I had not done it in A Levels But now looking back I'd think it did more harm to me as far as writing it as far as writing is concerned Studying literature made me a teacher and now it has made me an officer in the <O/>", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '4051d10c-8b3c-4466-ad97-c8e21efcf5e1', 'added':

that's the one yah Style in the African Novel okay So this critic was saying that it's very outmoded \n<$B> So yeah but otherwise they didn't really but they said the quality was not very very \n<$B> Oh I don't know I know one of the founders was Ngugi wa Thiong'o so that must have been quite a long time ago \n<$B> yeah So it went dormant as I was saying in the early eighties yeah and then we just revived it not so long ago \n<$B> Yah it's mostly men yeah not very old but I mean it's mostly men yeah Now well with women we are we hide in the kitchens you know all the time so yeah \n<$B> Well I think it's difficult for women to stand out anywhere I mean the struggle in life it's so hectic and then writing well which women write you know I think it's only women who have been to university or you know who would except for this uh Kenyan woman what's her name yes Ngurikie yeah but otherwise you know mostly it's women who it's people who have been to university who would write Now I think men who have been to university would still the leisure to sit down and think about literature and write but with women we get bogged down with children families and so maybe that's why yeah So we are very few yeah I mean okay we are fewer than men yeah \n<$B> Yeah you know in the sixties and early seventies there was a lot of excitement uh you know just after independence So you know the euphoria I think enabled people to hope and dream and therefore write about their dreams and then the economic crisis started hitting biting in the seventies and then the African governments became very \n<$B> Yah tight so I think you know one had to watch what they said and publish I mean writing was became quite dangerous so I think there were you know I mean like the people who were writing were people who really known you now Ngugi can afford to say anything you know Somehow he'll get a Western government to save him yeah but if you are not known you know nobody will even know you've been jailed yeah So you know I think I think also that's part of the reason because like uh well the generation of Ngugi and all that they started writing when they were much much younger than us people \n<$B> I mean my generation my generation \n<$B> Uh so let me say yeah uh we are students you know We are students of Ngugi you know so I think it was easier for them to write because the atmosphere was more relaxed uh but for us you know by the time we left university etcetera\n<$B> No I went to university in seventy-three so I finished in seventy-six \n<$B> Late seventies yeah so I was saying okay we were talking about <name/> maybe that's why there was that gap not just with <name/> but with many Okay I think one person who has kept on writing was <name/> He's a man he teaches here Okay he kept on writing but I think other people especially people who had not started maybe I think couldn't even get the courage to start So I think we had to wait until the late eighties you know to gather courage again \n<$B> Okay I think it came from the nineteen eighty-five conference End of uh Women's Decade Conference uh I think until then Kenyan women or maybe African women hadn't realised that you can speak out you know and then suddenly there was this big conference in <name/> you know in Nairobi and everybody was talking about women's experiences So okay I think that's what also encouraged uh people to start doing things There was I think a conference that took place a no a seminar that took place I think it was around eighty when did it happen maybe eighty-seven a follow-up I think so I remember attending something uh and then you know people were saying yeah but now that the decade is over you know what next I mean do we just bury everything Yeah so I think it was a follow-up from the decade I think it was yeah achievement \n<$B> Yeah I mean I don't know One has to let out what is in their heart uh you know Okay I think for other women you know okay other women the more affluent women they go out to saunas and things like that and they talk you know I mean we can't afford to We can't even afford one sauna per I don't know \n<$B> Yeah or per lifetime So you know what else do you do so okay after you've finished gossiping and all that you know yeah So I think it's also a very nice experience to feel that you can let out what is in your heart and then see it shared by other people I think it's an exciting experience yeah but then okay I personally am not burdened with all those things so yeah you know yeah I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of I mean I have a very relaxed job \n<$B> Uh well I like to write the kind of stories that I would like to read I mean I find it so boring you know these stories about the husband beating the wife and that kind of you know very depressing literature I mean I find it so boring I mean I just I can't even go through the story yeah I think we should no matter what our sufferings are I think we should write something more positive and show women triumphing you know over their situation rather than just you know moaning that we are so oppressed you know the men do this and that to us yeah So I hate complaining I hate moaning I think it's more interesting to create like a dream world \n<$B> Yeah there is somebody who wrote Letters to the Editor in one of the dailies in the Nation and it was a woman and she said this is obscene you know She said this is really totally disgusting and she said that after I read this story she quoted the story she didn't quote my name not that it matters to me Well she said after I read this story I gave it to my husband to read because I was totally disgusted something like that and he also agreed with me that this is pornography Yeah and she said it's like <name/>'s literature \n<$B> Yes so she said this is not the kind of literature we want our children to read and she said I had to hide this book uh I had to hide this uh magazine because I would not like my children to come across it So yeah you know it's true people don't want to even think that a woman can do some things I mean it's okay for the man you know Nobody will be shocked I mean it's not like in some western countries where somebody has to resign a prominent man has to resign because it's discovered he has a mistress I mean here nobody would have to resign It would be ridiculous to even report it \n<$B> Yeah I mean I think it's just that we have refused to be what I mean to be fair to each other you know the man and the woman yah I mean you know if the man can love his family and you know come home to his wife and all that and only once or twice a week you know see his mistress then why can't \n<$B> Yeah uh yeah so I think it's something that is possible \n<$B> Kenyans Well you know the adult readership yeah I mean okay so seeing I find it so boring to always be moaning that the men are doing this to us the men are doing I think we should also tell them that that there is something else I mean to say that there is something else you know and show what else is possible I mean it's possible to smile in life to dance to you know not just to sit there and you know have a cup of coffee and say oh men do this to us men do this to us I mean why don't we do something about it \n<$B> I think it's for everybody The men also found it very The male readers found it a bit controversial \n<$B> Uh they okay they said they found it very funny not funny but \n<$B> Yes strange you know yeah I mean they write such stories but that we should say that this kind of thing is possible is a different matter altogether \n<$B> Yeah so like the male readers were quite amused you know but I think it's still a good I think it's a good thing It shocks a bit yeah Then people start getting used to \n<$B> Yeah I'm very sure it's very frightening for them yeah They wouldn't dare tell you you know this is frightening no they won't but you know they say oh your story was really funny you know uh \n<$B> Yeah West African and Caribbean and what I saw the themes in the themes there's not much difference I mean you know like women are not any more say revolutionary than male writers about women's issues I mean like <name/> you know is very outspoken in defence of women but I think what I find uh Now Caribbean women were different I mean they talk about themselves more you know like the African women whom I studied and this was nineteen eighty-three to eighty-six so it's women who wrote in the late seventies uh they deal with very you know like domestic issues but I mean domestic uh What I  <what IRRR mean is like domesticated issues I mean they don't dare say things that will shock everybody you know like uh okay they'll show women talking about politics but not a woman you know contesting a presidential seat because by that time you know it was unimaginable uh So you know at that time the themes were not different I think it was really I didn't find any difference I had set out I mean I was almost sure that I would find women writings very very different from male writing but I didn't uh Now Caribbean were as I said were more outspoken Therefore they said things that men had maybe not said about women like <name/> <nmae/> okay I remember one thing that really struck me it's this in <name/> she's talking about a woman who is the first wife of this patriarch and she is already considered very old so he has stopped sleeping with her and all that and then we are told that she's thirty-two I think she's thirty-two or thirty-six", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '709e5a2c-7f20-48e1-a091-af3b9e4fbeae', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.218640+00:00', 'english_score': 0.992278516292572,

{'text': "<$B> I was saying uh that I am an optimist and uh regardless of the problems uh with which women have to contend uh in order to produce any writings because of the many roles that they have to play I think women are very committed to uh improving on their position and uh I see here in Kenya for example uh a lot of hope for women writers to emerge Now what is happening is that uh the few women writers we have today are trying also to influence the younger generation uh There are times that I have been invited for example to go and uh adjudicate drama in schools and I always find myself influencing the children there to write and write works which do address themselves to the position of women In a small way we are influencing even the younger generation In a small way through our writings we are also influencing society that it is important for women to write I think there is hope You can't of course quantify you know how much how many writings there will be coming up in the next century or so but I see you know a lot of hope\n<$B> I must say it's very difficult for a woman to write especially if she's not uh if her job is not very close to books I would say for example <name/> she has has been working as a in education administration I think the atmosphere there is not very good for creativity for creative work A woman who is in a teaching profession like myself like uh <name/> uh it's you know a bit I won't use the word easier but I think the situation we are in is more conducive to production of literature uh I would say that that is uh you know a difference\n<$B> No I would not agree I would not say that women's issues have just started last year I would not even say that\n<$B> The discussions I would not even say that the discussions started uh you know in nineteen eighty-five I think the discussions have been there It's only that uh maybe the heat if I can use that term\n<$B> Yes maybe right now we are hotter because programmes have been introduced Sometimes I must say that you know even the donor organisations are taking a keener interest than before and therefore you know you are able to produce texts like uh the one you were showing me <title/> This one was uh wasn't it\n<$B> Supported by Sida\n<$B> Yah so it's the heat I think we are becoming hotter as time goes on because of various uh you know reasons\n<$B> The political development yes thank you very much The political development in Kenya is also uh playing a role and this democratisation process is contributing in the sense that uh people are becoming freer in expression than before Therefore where in the past you would have been afraid of being termed anti-African culture if you talked against wife-beating for example today you are not afraid of that yah\n<$B> Now I would say yes and no uh I'll start with the no Uh The African woman has not uh always been impervious to uh change that is uh she has not always taken those beatings without saying no to them She has not always carried those those burdens without saying they are too heavy There has always been uh a kind of uh you know background resistance by women Granted it was not vocalized in the same way in which it is vocalized today because we were living in different types of cultures and uh there were certain yah certain norms to observe okay So there was resistance from the women but not in the way in which we are doing it now now before \n<$B> What I want say is that there are influences yes from the west both from uh writings and also from you know ideas that we share in certain forums like uh during the eighty-five uh the nineteen eighty-five End of Women's Decade you know Conference or when uh any of us travel to a conference overseas there are ways in which we influence each other but what I strongly uh disagree with is this idea that uh liberation of women or whatever we might call it because we haven't come up with one term\n<$B> Striving for equality or whatever is something that we're importing from the west That one I would disagree with\n<$B> Because yah it was part of the traditional culture It's only that the mechanism was different uh Yah\n<$B> now I must first of all begin by confessing that I have very little time for reading for pleasure but when I do I get uh a lot of uh uh inspiration from reading I'm talking about during the last uh from nineteen eighty-five and I will tell you why from nineteen eighty-five any works that have to do with have anything to do with uh gender issues I've been very much interested whenever I have any leisure time now what happened in nineteen eighty-five was that January nineteen eighty-five uh I went to Britain to do my PhD and it was on uh women's issues I did a PhD on drama and uh the thesis was entitled <title/> and since then I have found that there is so much to find out about is I I haven't got of the root of the problem yah so any time I have free time I look at \n<$B> Yes I also read I also read that yes or journals Yes journals One problem we have here is that we do not get yes Works are not very accessible \n<$B> Yes yeah It's very difficult It's a That's a very important but very difficult you know question because African women are having to deal with so many problems at the same time There is the basic problem of feeding the family educating the children and so forth So even when uh we address ourselves to the position of women here in Africa we do not isolate it from uh the position of uh women and children and the family and men and so forth So for me the hope really lies in uh everybody contributing that is men women and the children I'm not saying that each group will necessarily have to do the same as the other group no I'm saying that uh there is a lot that can be attained in terms of uh you know the success if men can also be won over into you know helping like the attitudes I was talking about in that paper I was doing for <name/> Those attitudes you cannot order people to change attitudes and yet it's so important for example for a man our men to change the attitude for example that a women is an object So there has to be a way in which we can also persuade them that it is beneficial to them as members of our society and as individuals as well and as fathers and so forth if the position of women can be changed so that she is no longer an object because if a woman is no longer an object I'm just taking this as an example if a woman is no longer an object it means she has greater dignity it means that uh even her output not just in material terms in terms of contributing towards the welfare of the children but even uh you know even her relationship to her man is much better than when she's regarded as a woman \n<$B> Yes I would say education of the daughters is crucial and uh education in the right direction educating them uh to uh do away with stereotyped images but also let me add education of the boys is as important because if the boys grow up uh you know developing into the type of men who look down on women then however educated or however enlightened the girls are uh we won't get anywhere so it's education of both \n<$B> Yes yeah I think economic independence uh for women is also very important uh What I find is that if a woman is economically dependent she is then reduced to a position where she can accept being trodden upon because you dare not question the authority if you depend on that authority but if you are economically independent then you have a say as to how you can be treated as to how the family should be treated as to how the general direction the society should take \n<$B> Okay let me take that as a separate question after I have responded to this one uh Yes I would say that with educated women their opinions are more respected or there Was that the general question you were asking Yes uh a women who is more educated you know her ideas are more respected uh but she has had to work hard at it because there are still those attitudes for example at meetings that uh that one is just a woman she's just making noise So we've had not only to work very hard at concretising our ideas We also have had to gain some aggression so that if somebody tries to shout you down before you are finished you still continue \n<$B> Now uh there is a change but I would say it's not uh a very positive one at the moment because we are in a transitional period where an educated woman like myself uh you are also uh you also have a responsibility to generate resources for the family You also have to contribute very much towards you know decisions So when you are doing that we are also operating on a situation where it has not become clear-cut Because the educated woman is different is operating differently in the sense that she is that relations between educated women and you know their men their husbands uh they're made difficult by the fact that it's like there are two bulls in Do you know that kind of proverb yes and I'm not saying this in any negative kind of way but then it's not the fault of the woman It's not the fault of the man It's just that we're operating in a situation in a culture where the man is supposed to be the head and the woman the neck or there down and it is not possible for an educated woman to accept the position of the neck That's the way I see it \n<$B> Yes in fact it is a bitter reality now that many uh successful women not just educated but also women who are uh you know successful business women uh it is a reality that there are many of them now in Kenya who are not married and are raising families as single women or divorced uh because you know the men either the men are uh feel threatened too threatened to approach these women as you know wives or if they marry them uh again too much conflict There is that but I see that as a phase I don't see it as something that will be permanent I see it as a phase \n<$B> I'm saying it's new because you know in the past we did not I'm talking about in traditional settings first of all we did not have divorces if we had divorces uh it would be the last resort and usually it would not be the woman divorcing a man It would be the woman being divorced because in the first place the man marries you So a woman would not divorce a man first of all because the society did not allow it but also because a woman was uh dependent on the man and divorcing the man or leaving the man would mean you are also leaving your economic uh you know sustenance source yes Widows coming to widows there was inheritance of widows in many of our cultures Not that I'm saying that it was positive but it played its role then in the sense that then the family of the widow the children of the widow you know woman were looked after I'm not talking about in positive sense of course On the critical side of it as a woman I see it as one of the ways in which women were regarded as you know property yah so I'm saying it's a new thing now that divorced women or widowed women are being looked at as threats \nS1A029K \n<$B> My first book is called <title/> That's my first book and uh this was my observation of uh the foreign missionaries Christians coming to convert Africans and may I say I was one of them because I lived in a church compound because my father was a priest So I had looked at this the way they I came to understand it later being educated being mature being travelled and also learned that the British Church or the western Church all of them including others beside uh Anglican were sort of mixing the Christianity with their culture They want your culture to They mix it the way they believed in their law for example I don't really mean it because I'm not brought up with it but for example the attitude of people who have two or three wives and they'll come and put it as a law because in their country it's not allowed So they come here and say if you are Christian you should have one wife Some become Christians when they are already have two wives what do you do with them So it is more of a confusion between the western civilisation western religion and African culture because how can I be an African and a Christian without interfering with some traditional uh vows you have to go through to be recognized in your community and at the same time I'm now converted I'm a Christian How can you combine these There's a lot of confusion and very deep book although it's a bit dull perhaps because people like to read about love and exciting things but this is a very deep thing and some religious colleges use it because it is a conflict of western civilisation and Christianity which they bring to Africa and Africans are Africans anyway Some have a sense of <O/> some are very traditional you know and to be a good Christian sometimes you find you have to even break up from your community from your traditional custom to be a good Christian in the western kind of look including clothes decoration hairdos life social lives how we live in the community the traditional ceremonies you have to go as an African to be recognized by your community Some are banned by the Christianity so there's the book and also it goes and goes and brings revolution of the young generation I was thinking of myself how I used to think this is very wrong when you find you're very lost within your community because you don't know how they live You don't know their tradition I've never been to a Kikuyu dance I know they dance but I've never watched their ceremony \n<$B> I have travelled in Kenya and I mix with a lot of uh other women in Kenya who were brought up like myself by the first generation of uh of Christians and we were meeting in colleges and in high school and we know each other very well Therefore we know what I complain about I'll get somebody from Nyanza doing saying the same They are the same missionaries and whether they are Catholics or Anglican or Methodist or Protestant anything they are all they were all treated and faced it simply So it is more all round other tribes yes and I think it did quite a bit of a damage Mind you missionaries did a lot of good things I'm not saying that I'm still I'm a very good Christian but the thing is that they didn't understand the culture the meaning of it and uh they brought education That's why we are educated they brought They were really treating people who were sick They brought health in the community and education civilisation but that small bit of culture also did quite a bit of damaging in our society and you'll find people don't know where they stand Yes So this is what I was trying to say and I was educated by missionaries brought up in their church compound and I was a teacher in a school church Therefore I know everything and the changes in the young generation who revoke their kind of father's belief Why is the villager doing this and not me Why can't I wear my braids in my hair like anybody else and why don't I wear big earrings you know this kind of thing and uh you find that they started to note that they are missing something \n<$B> With me I write natural All I need is to keep quiet I don't even need to open my eyes I just do it like that It comes natural \n<$B> Any time of the Not any time Sometimes you find that you are not with it but if I have uh a quiet atmosphere like now I'm in a writing mood I wrote quite a lot which has been being typed yesterday Sometimes if I am in a good atmosphere by that I mean not uh noisy not uh too much socialising I can write and I have many many many many things I would like to write but I have no time \n<$B> First of all not to make money I don't think I was writing to make money I was just feeling that this is how I look at this I want to put it on a paper that somebody can see it Even when I started writing I didn't I wasn't writing to be a book but anything any incident I think of or hear I just sit down and write it down it's there without saying it's first page or not then I heap and heap and heap and later on somebody started talking about writing Then I said how I see incidents and I write He said he insisted he must see it I said no they are very rough He said you I want to see it I said you can't read it My handwriting when I'm emotional you can't even write read He insisted get somebody to type and I'll read it So I did it and when he did he assisted me and encouraged me to write \n<$B> It's the way you are born the way you create it and the way you look at things I'm very good at drama also I'm a broadcaster and I'm good at drama and I look at things in that and writing is not uh training Mind you I never had a problem in the life because I was brought up not very rich but I never experienced poverty I never experienced any difficulties not that but it's the way you just look at life and the way your mind works That's how what I think \n<$B> I write for other people I feel when I write it should be read that somebody else should look \n<$B> No I was feeling this must be as I say I wasn't The first book I wasn't writing for other people to read \n<$B> It's just Should I say recording you're just recording what you Do you know I even write sometimes on a traffic light I write because I put a notebook on in uh my driving side of my car and where I always put a pen Sometimes the other day I went There are a lot of little boys naughty boys here I was driving near the railway station and I saw a little boy who came and grabbed a handbag from somebody Police was there and they started chasing this boy and they can't catch the little boy and I stopped and I watched and I watched and I just sat there and I was just writing him and the way he was dressing and you know and I enjoy doing like that I feel it can make a very interesting little story and they didn't catch the boy He went and cut across cars and crossed the road and the police they are waiting for a car to pass and the boy has gone and I found it a very interesting story where I'm concerned \n<$B> That's historical \n<$B> Yes and uh that in fact up to now is my favourite book because I felt it came from me Maybe I was too excited about my first published work and uh it's still my best book It doesn't go very much but it's my best best book It's slow \n<$B> From me and I was very happy when I went to a college somewhere in America I can't remember which one just to find that it was in the library and I asked the the person because there is they have a Department of Development Studies African Studies That's where it was and then I said do you have a religious group here I would like them to read that book because that shows the good work as well as the damage they did socially \n<$B> No I'll tell you what this book First of all I'm a Kikuyu and I told you the kind of atmosphere I was brought up with I I didn't participate at all at all in Mau Mau no because missionaries sent us They are white people They're religious people They can't tell lies They don't like people like that As my father put it they are religious they are preachers they are converted they don't want people who will be asking or somebody taking a note and saying oh yes because they will disclose They were avoided Christianity In fact I learned most of them people who got into problems in the village ran away to the missionary centre to hide from the commotion of the freedom and dangers of uh I don't know whether you have been in a place where people are fighting Guerrilla war is very bad because armed forces fight you go where people are fighting but in guerrilla war you are caught in the market you know it is very very dangerous You'll be found at midnight I wasn't Mau Mau and this I only got the passport because I was in Nairobi I married uh I was married and you had to have these IDs \n<$B> Yes but because I think it's natural that I'm very very much interested with people That's my nature I'm interested to know what people are doing how they are what they think and I spend a lot of time talking to even your leaders even prostitutes I talk to even here in Nairobi like the other day I was in Mombasa and I was having a lunch and I was uh there is one hotel which is very popular with even you find prostitutes hanging around and I they come and sit there and they drink also So I started talking to them and we had a talk of more than one hour with these prostitutes Why are you a prostitute and how does it feel to be selling yourself this kind I talk to anybody that's what I was trying to say and uh my husband is not a Kikuyu He's a Maasai and he was a doctor and sometimes we stay in a remote area We don't have much to do and people who are there even they hardly speak Swahili because they've never been exposed to the public when you are in the bush and believe it or not I'm not Maasai but I know more about Maasai than my husband because \n<$B> I talk to them I talk to them and they come to my house They want to see a doctor I never stop them even if they shouldn't but they are uneducated they don't know the limit of how to that you shouldn't interrupt a doctor in the house They come I may give gave them tea They like very a lot of sugar They like bread and jam and they all like me and we talk until I found myself speaking their language I didn't learn it \n<$B> I just talked They can't speak Swahili so they say I learned to get to know what they are saying", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL',

{'text': "<$B> Uh I don't think there is any discrimination in the publishing houses as such I think the situation is simply that fewer women have been writing again for obvious reasons that probably I don't know what the situation is now but there have been less educated women because it is only very recently that we are beginning to see many many girls you know going to school In certain districts in this country you'll find there are more girls in school than boys at certain levels in the primary school although unhappily by the time you come to the end let's say to the end of uh Form Four or Form Six when we had it you found that it was the other way round the girls had dropped out again You know our problems as women but I think it's simply that we have been less women writing and even now we have less women writing I don't think we have a problem of education now All I think happens is that even those of us who want to write we find that we can hardly find time to sit to sit and write because of our other duties Even the educated woman is still not not that she still has her problems as a woman We haven't overcome many many many problems yes We still have a lot on our shoulders yes \n<$B> I don't think so I don't think it's the individual husband who is against the woman writing It's just that we get tied up in everything we have to do the children the house and so on and it's worse for the educated Do you know that It's worse \n<$B> For the educated woman because you Okay you would like to be here in the office for instance you would like to I would like to excel in this but I still have those traditional jobs \n<$B> You know waiting for the children the same husband who is there He's just there \n<$B> That's it So that's why I'm saying I think the educated woman is almost worse off \n<$B> Because she has this extra job You'd like to be a career woman You'd like to do this You'd like to travel You would \n<$B> Yes and we sometimes see it when we go out for some time and you come back to the house and you find now it isn't running the way it normally runs you see There are always omissions here and there yes \n<$B> Even where they try I mean even where they try you find they may be well-intentioned and they would tell you I thought that would be impossible to find here I kept telling them to tell me what was missing in this house and you wonder why didn't he go to the small kitchen or to a store and look around and go to the supermarket himself instead of asking what is it like you don't have here You know that phase \n<$B> Yah because they too were brought up that way yes \n<$B> My mother-in-law for instance up to today I mean she when she comes to our house she doesn't want to see any one of my two sons coming from the direction of the kitchen and he will be confronted and say I have seen you twice going to the kitchen what are you going to do What role have you there since when do the men begin to go to the kitchen you know like that So when you say now I expect this boy to do some work there or to go and make himself an egg if he's so if he wants \n<$B> She says you people I don't know what kind of men you are going to produce <O/> and you understand that's how she brought up her sons and one of her sons happens to be my husband It will take some time \n<$B> But it is an uphill battle \n<$B> Because they also see but they also see you know the boys also see how we live in the house They see what papa does and what he doesn't do and so on and so forth So they will tend to you know \n<$B> But they will certainly be different from him \n<$B> Yes we can if we are not sensitized if we are not properly sensitized we can perpetuate you know this position and yet here I would like to say I'm not I am I'm not saying I didn't want a woman to have some break to swap roles with him because I also would like to acknowledge the fact that there are many many many things that he does and I don't do you know for that family right I don't even think about them because it is there \n<$B> Yeah and this is something that we sometimes forget that we also have our roles you know like <O/> \n<$B> There are certain responsibilities I expect him to carry out you know \n<$B> And I don't bother about and for that reason I enjoy freedom kind of freedom if you like For instance I mean I don't sometimes I don't know how much he pays you know for bills I know they come and many a time I shall not even open them I leave him to see to it and when things break down in there I you know I see somebody coming and he says I was told to come by Prof essor so and so to repair this you see and uh that's if I want if I enjoy that if I like that he probably also likes it when I do something else and make sure I don't bother him with it and so on and so forth \n<$B> You know I get very shy when you say I'm also writing because I've written so little I my writing kind of it means that intentional and I suppose my being an editor also hampers my writing You tend to enjoy you know just you know criticizing other people's writing more than \n<$B> Yah being productive yourself \n<$B> But I hadn't thought of writing until this project this nineteen eighty-nine project came up \n<$B> This yeah the nineteen eighty-nine workshop where we did you know these books and since I was among the women that happened to know it again I was I told you I was doing some background work like I was counting the money and putting it in envelopes and so on and so forth I said why don't I write here everybody seems to be writing I wrote and apparently the story was acceptable \n<$B> I wrote at home but you know \n<$B> For this special yeah for the workshop and then came the other one Again I said I'm going to write and I wrote and the story again was accepted which is going to be in the Longman book that we were talking about There has been a <O/> workshop after that Kenya oral literature which I tried I started a story but I had to go to Tanzania so I did not complete it I hope I can still complete it but uh if I may talk about the writing that is intended in me I would certainly like to go into uh that a similar kind of writing about women There is something about women and children if you like that needs to be said you know many many things that need to be said The only thing I would like to say is that for me I think I would strike a middle kind of course I do not see myself going all the way and just blasting the men and you know and so on and so forth They have their place in their lives you know with us I don't know if you people have husbands or not Do you okay both of you \n<$B> Yes those of us with husbands I think they have a place in there I mean there are many many moments when we cannot imagine our lives without that man There are many moments when they are angels who suddenly uh I know there are many moments that my husband has been more than a husband He's been more of a friend than anything and I know he tries He tries I mean even with the children he tries Whenever he has time he wants to be with them because he doesn't have much time to be with them but when he has \n<$B> He has been a professor at the university until about five years \n<$B> And when he's sure that you're all laughing then he takes off Then he takes off These days he's away many times away from home in foreign countries Just now he's away in Mombasa but when he has that like on Sunday afternoons he wants to be with them and uh they also miss him so much that at such times they will not let him go you know and those are the times now I take off Usually I will just take off together with women or they will go and leave me at home and I'll relax So all I'm saying is that personally I will not be that kind of person who says everything negative about men because they are not always negative I know they can be brutes but not all of them Sometimes it depends on their age Sometimes they are wild and then they when they are recovered \n<$B> They calm down and so on uh So that is what I would like to write about I mean just I would like to take the middle course and give credit where due but then still highlight I mean what remains of what we need to say about ourselves because I also realise as I was telling you the other day that when you talk to them and I realised it when we produced this book Our Secret Lives you know men would read and say you mean these things happen Now I think there was this one who said I think we need to be more careful with our wives if we sometimes cause them so much pain you know something like that \n<$B> Another one whose name I shall not uh mention who is a book he's a book consultant here was telling me he was in western Zambia He came from Zambia himself He was telling me of a time when his wife left for some three weeks and he didn't know why she had left So after three weeks when he had found she was still not coming back and here he was with the children He went to her three weeks ago and he asked her Grace what happened why did you go and she said you know you've been like this and he was telling me you know it made me very sad I almost because I did not know that I was treating her like this I did not know \n<$B> That I was causing her pain you know so he said I am very sorry I did not know I was causing you so much pain please come and I will be very very careful and in the future please just make sure you tell me when I cause you you know any pain \n<$B> Yes there is a lack of communication \n<$B> No yeah you know she shouldn't yes So the man thinks he's just being a man I mean behind the other men and so he doesn't know he's doing something So if she's quiet and many of them are willing They're willing to maintain a peaceful atmosphere yes He was telling that to me as we sat outside the hall where the book fair was going on \n<$B> Or women have not brought out I mean they are just suffering there in silence \n<$B> Take that one for instance of communication While we fail ourselves to communicate and then we think that our men are being you know I'm sure you can think of a situation where you are not open enough and uh you suffered you know you suffered a lot you see and from my experience I want to talk about things in fact I'm the one who talks about anything when it comes to it",

{'text': "<$A> The impact of the address which would be the Zanzibar President's in the House uh of House ofRRR Representatives Zanzibar on eighteenth What was it eighteenth of\n<$B> November\n<$A> Okay the day is not important but uh what the issue we was talking about we are therefore maybe uh the question to address ourselves is what we materialise or what we think of the address which was made by the Zanzibar Presidents\n<$B> I think Mr Juma wants to say something maybe uh\n<$C> Not out of uh the question What you're trying to discuss now is about the current situation and the near future of about the position of the \n<$B> the political situation \n<$C> Yeah and the position of Zanzibar President then is that what you're discussing\n<$B> Yeah\n<$C> Yeah in my opinion and in my considered opinion it has shocked me to a large extent to see that the status of the Zanzibar President is going to be minimised though the Tanzanian Union government is maintaining that the status of Zanzibargovernment of the President of Zanzibar is going to I mean to increase to be increased but in actual fact it's like becoming uh a region and is not like uh a state or as a nation state but it's more like a region You see to have a President <O/> what you call a flag is nothing it's like a commissioner of a regional officer or someone else So to my mind I think this should not be implemented in the near future and I also stressed it to my fellow Zanzibari who are maybe in Zanzibar or somewhere else to come out with a different argument suggestion and proposal or advice about this This should not be taken for granted that is if it is the situation that is very conducive for Zanzibari You see most of the changes that are being done in the present situation are only benefit one side of the  coin not the other side of the coin The mainlanders are the ones who pressurise things for their own benefit I have seen and I've tried to summarise three items that have tried and that have already impinged on Zanzibar One was as soon as Zanzibar joined the OIC what happened I mean the President of was forced in one way or another to withdraw from the \n<$B> But that was contrary to the constitution\n<$C> Who give the permission to the President to sign this\n<$B> Yes Zanzibar does not have power\n<$C> Wasn't there a President in Tanzania Union government wasn't there\n<$B> What What\n<$C> Who give the permission for Zanzibar President to sign contract to join OIC\n<$B> But why they neglect Zanzibar\n<$C> Pull out\n<$B> Yes Why\n<$C> This is just a\n<$B> Yes because there was sentenced that it was contrary to the constitution\n<$C> Secondly was also about the question of whether or not to remove the passport when you go to Zanzibar and it was officially accepted \n<$B> Yes because this is one country Why then would uh the mainlanders should carry their passports when going to Zanzibar It's just one country\n<$C> Basically it's one country but we have got this is uh is just part of the uh another I mean continent It is not in another country but you've got uh this is mainland and that is island\n<$B> Yes but it's one country it's just uh \n<$C> That is but let us take the length and the width of Zanzibar island and the people who are there What do you think if there are so many people are just coming in the country\n<$B> And why there are so many people in Tanzania mainland\n<$C> You see the space\n<$B> Many Zanzibari are there\n<$C> The space\n<$B> What is\n<$C> For instance in Tanzania mainland\n<$B> I think you tend to be uh\n<$C> No no no For instance in Tanzania mainland there are about twenty-two million people who are residing in Tanzania mainland but in Zanzibar we are about only seven seven hundred thousand I think yeah about seven hundred thousand Therefore how do you do youRRR expect twenty-seven million people to be allowed to come in islands which only reside seven hundred thousand people \n<$B> Yes but that does not mean that the all the Dar es Salaam all Tanzania residents or all the mainlanders will go to Zanzibar\n<$C> You know \n<$B> No they are just uh \n<$C> You know when you are planning you have to think for the future\n<$B> Yes but don't you think\n<$C> You don't \n<$B> You don't think that uh that cannot be practical How can you imagine that when uh the government decides that uh their people from mainland should not carry their passports when go to Zanzibar does it mean that all the mainlanders will go to Zanzibar Of course not \n<$C> But it might have been\n<$B> On what circumstances\n<$C> No they might decide to go there just to maybe for leaving \n<$B> Leaving all their things only\n<$C> Why not Why there are so many\n<$B> For what purposes\n<$C> What there are so many Zanzibaris  on Tanzania mainland\n<$B> Yes there are so many Zanzibaris and uh  on Tanzania mainland \n<$C> Why\n<$B> and uh the mainland is not affected\n<$C> Why\n<$B> Why\n<$C> The question is why \n<$B> are the mainlanders not uh\n<$C> No no no the question is why there are so many Zanzibaris in\n<$B> Well there are so many angles to look at this One of them is economic for economic reasons Therefore most of them find it more profitable uh to live in Dar es Salaam and other mainland regions\n<$A> You know I think the question which we should address ourselves is what is the reason behind of the bill which was tabled before the parliament you know because we have what we have seen is the well I can say the disintegration of Zanzibar of Zanzibari nationality\n<$B> Do you mean Zanzibar is\n<$A> Yeah it's becoming to be\n<$B> It's becoming disintegrated\n<$A> Yeah That's what I wanted to say and therefore what I think we should address ourselves is why mainlanders are championing of bringing about these changes in the constitution and some other things That is a question which we should\n<$B> Yes because they uh see that uh they have been uh exploited by the Zanzibaris\n<$A> No\n<$B> For quite a long time \n<$A> No you have just\n<$B> Yes no\n<$A> No you have just heard today from the radio that Tanzania *continental> is poorer than Zanzibar This is the it is the third or which place was it\n<$B> Tanzania mainland \n<$A> Tanzania mainland \n<$B> uh The second to Mozambique\n<$A> The second to Mozambique Zanzibar was not mentioned\n<$B> Yes it was not mentioned uh\n<$A> Because we are <O/>\n<$B> Yes you have benefited a lot\n<$A> No \n<$B> Yes\n<$A> No that's not the point\n<$B> Okay let us hear Mr Juma Maybe he has got something to say\n<$C> Yeah In addition to what I was trying to say was that I mentioned to us but in the last one is that the position of Zanzibar President which is going to be minimised So all these three trends are the ones that are really and objectively done to ensure that Zanzibar is no longer as a state as itself now\n<$B> It's no longer a state\n<$C> Yes\n<$B> What do you mean\n<$A> But what's the meaning of a state\n<$B> A state is a nation or is a group of people or let me call let me conceptualise at the national level\n<$A> Okay\n<$C> is the\n<$B> You're having nostalgia for your beloved lecturer Dr Max Mmuya\n<$C> Yeah What he say a state without uh I mean power is like a state\n<$B> Do you mean Zanzibar is going to be powerless\n<$C> Of course definitely and then already because everything is switched on and off here from mainland\n<$A> No no It's not that Zanzibar is going to be powerless It is powerless\n<$B> No I don't think if now Zanzibar is powerless \n<$A> It is powerless \n<$B> On what grounds\n<$A> It will be much more powerless \n<$B> On what grounds is it powerless\n<$A> What grounds\n<$B> Yeah\n<$A> You have just cited an example saying that in two years two years ago the Zanzibar government decided to join the OIC Then I remember our beloved President \n<$B> Yes but that was contrary to the constitution\n<$A> No it was not contrary to the constitution\n<$B> It was\n<$A> It was not\n<$B> Do you have any evidence\n<$A> Yeah\n<$C> As a lawyer\n<$A> No no no not as a lawyer because what I \n<$B> Just from common sense\n<$A> What I want to tell you that Zanzibar's taking membership of the OIC and then it was admitted as a member in the OIC but the condition in OIC is that once you become a member you become a memberRRR you have to be let us let me put it in the other way that only a country or a state is allowed to be a member in that organisation Organisation of Islamic state Therefore Zanzibar is not a state in the real sense because when delegation of Zanzibar go to the meeting in the OIC OK in front of them they are supposed to have their flag Which flag would they put No no which flag\n<$B> It's not important\n<$A> It is important Which flag will they put\n<$B> To have flags is not important\n<$A> No it is important\n<$B> Okay if that uh\n<$A> Flag is like a shirt and  trouser>-+_trousers> When you are going somewhere without a trouser and shirts it's shameful\n<$B> But you can wear something else\n<$A> Why\n<$B> You can wear a long uh\n<$A> grasses or what\n<$B> garment not grasses\n<$A> No no what I mean is you have to have something to cover your body that is we have to have our identity Our identity is a flag\n<$B> Only a flag\n<$A> No that's only one part one thing there are so many things which we are crying for and we can't of of course discuss all of them \n<$B> and uh\n<$A> some of them are very sensitive\n<$B> Okay\n<$A> I think if we mention them here we might find ourselves\n<$B> Okay Am I to infer from your explanation that uh Zanzibar is becoming or has become powerless because of the union\n<$A> Because of the not because of the the union because the way the union is taken to be Maybe let me tell you one thing\n<$B> Can you put it in both <O/> terms\n<$A> Yeah In nineteen sixty-four we had the so-called union between Zanzibar and Tanganyika\n<$B> The so-called \n<$A> The so-called I call it the so-called because it is not as exactly the union \n<$B> I hope you will give us more explanation on that later on\n<$A> Therefore we had the so-called union between Zanzibar and Tanganyika Therefore in that union we had the article of union okay Therefore we had the article of union which stipulates I mean the grounds the kind of the union to be and some other things Therefore we the article of the union is about fourteen  sections I think Fourteen articles we call them articles We have article one up to article four it's definition and some other they define concept and some other things but article five that is the foundation \n<$C> Of the union\n<$A> The foundation of the union because it says how the union is going to be It  mentions who will be the first President of the union it say who will be the second President of the second the the first vice-president of the union and some other things And then they also mention in that article five the what they are calling the lists of the things which will be termed as union matters There were eleven Okay And then they put also \n<$B> Procedure\n<$A> They didn't put procedure for amendment but what you find now is that in that article is they did say that the Zanzibar President will be the vice-president and will be the I mean the the vice-president of the Tanzania President That is in the act\n<$B> That is in the act\n<$A> United Republic of Tanzania In the act the actRRR of union they did say that But what we are we areRRR seeing now they have decided to strike that article from that act\n<$B> Is that you see the constitution\n<$A> No no no wait\n<$B> Is by convention\n<$A> No wait\n<$B> Both parties they both parties agreed if they are the ones who\n<$A> There are two things which you might you have to know You are not arguing here like sociologists We are arguing in legal point of view Therefore in Tanzania what I want to say is we have two  kinds of constitution", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$C> And what was done\n<$A> Therefore look at the second schedule before discussing what was done The second schedule reads Matters the alteration of which requires the concurrence of two thirds of members of parliament hailing from Mainland Tanzania and two thirds of members of parliament from Tanzania Zanzibar The first matter is contingents of the United Republic of Tanzania It seems to be decided by two thirds of members of Zanzibar and Mainland The contingents of the office of the United Republic of Tanzania the executive authority of the United Republic the contingents of the parliament of the United Republic of Tanzania the executive authority of the Zanzibar government Therefore the High Court of Zanzibar the least of the Union matters Therefore here I want to discuss two things First one is the contingents I mean the executive authority of the government of Zanzibar\n<$C> Do you mind help us to put up these things\n<$A> The executive authority of the government of Zanzibar Therefore when you are talking of the executive authority I think you have had your PS first year and second year therefore you understand what I mean Therefore the President of Zanzibar is the chief is the executive in Zanzibar Okay Therefore in actual union he is supposed to be by law the vice-president of Tanzania\n<$B> Okay I agree uh with what you have said on legal point of view\n<$A> Oh legal point of view That's what I said Wait I haven't finished\n<$B> Okay all right\n<$A> Therefore what they have done they have taken the Zanzibar president not to be vice-president but only to be a member in the cabinet Not legal That is contrary to the article of the union and then the second point I want to clarify is this Those matters which were to be when they want to be altered two thirds of members of parliament hailing from Mainland Tanzania and two thirds of  members of parliament hailing from Zanzibar<O/> the least of the union matters You know the least of the union matters they were eleven they were enumerated in this constitution Here they are constitution external affairs defence security police emergency power citizen If you reach up to the eleven that is uh they were put in the Act of Union but from twelve up to twenty-one these were done not in accordance with the Act of the Union not in accordance to the constitution Now they are twenty-one here in the list but now they are twenty-two They say you know we have just come to the introduction of the multiparty system and they say now that now multiparty is inefficient one political party is inefficient but this has been done with not enough policy to the constitution not in accordance to the Act of the Union because in the parliament what we have seen is they have just passed the bill and I think one hundred and sixty-four of the members of parliament they accepted it only five objected it They took it generally while they were supposed to take Zanzibar members what they are saying and Tanzania members what they are saying Tanganyika members what they are syaing Therefore if they get two third of members of parliament hailing from Zanzibar they do have they had to support it Then if they do that can become a bill and then it can be tabled before the President to assert it But what they did is not that Therefore the procedures were not followed Therefore what I say is the RRR I mean the passing of the Bill of Parliament the eleventh amendment of the constitution was illegal and null and void\n<$B> I agree basically to what you have said but uh do you think the parliamentarians and the speaker were uh fool enough to pass the Bill which is unconstitutional\n<$A> That is obvious because what I want to say\n<$B> Oh Do you you mean to say they are laymen they don't understand the constitution\n<$A> The MPs from Zanzibar are laymen\n<$B> So so\n<$A> In believing they are taking advantage out of it\n<$B> Okay okay Do you want to mean that the Zanzibar parliamentarians are to blame\n<$A> Of course they are to blame They were supposed to go by the procedures I think What I know is that the speaker the speaker of parliament knows the procedure but what he wanted to do was just to pass the bill because he knew if he said maybe you Zanzibarians have to decide it on your own and you mainlanders have to decide it on your own it couldn't be passed Therefore he took advantage of Zanzibar members of parliament to be ignorant or\n<$B> Okay What do you think of the reason that uh Mr Puis Msekwa gave uh One of the most important  reasons that he gave is that under the new political sysetm of multi-partyism there is uh The situation is there is a possibility of having one party winning in Zanzibar and another party in the mainland And therefore there is a need to have another person uh who is not the President of Zanzibar being the vice-president What do you think of that reason\n<$A> That is contrary to the Act of the Union The Act of the Union  says that the Zanzibar president should be one another vice-president is in the mainland\n<$B> Okay okay The Act of the Union was made by the Tanzanians or the Tanganyikans and Zanzibarirs and we can can>/> change it as we always argued Tanzanians any concerned body if parliamentarians or the lawyers \n<$A> But the body still didn't consult us\n<$B> No they have not changed\n<$A> No they have already We are waiting for Mwinyi to assent \n<$C> Okay let us stop the discussion which is\n<$B> and he has not done it\n<$C> endless So now let us have a cup of tea so as to refresh your minds and later on we'll continue with the discussion\n<$B> And we hope to get\n<$A> Because even Msekwa when he was interrogated by the Hafidh Ali he say that the list is only six\n<$B> He was telling lies\n<$A> Yah but the list is eight It's not six and I don't think that the speaker doesn't know this He knows but maybe he excluded when he said six I think he excluded the list of the Union and the executive authority of the government of Zanzibar and then he remained with six That's what he did And then what I wanted to tell you is that Hafidh Ali knows the football rules\n<$B> Seventeen rules okay\n<$A> Seventeen rules of football of the game He doesn't know a law Therefore\n<$B> He's layman\n<$A> He's layman of course like those who  put him in the place They are laymen too\n<$B> Okay now what do you think should be done Are there any prospects It seems that most of the Zanzibaris \n<$A> Yeah You know \n<$B> have been very much annoyed by these things Now do you see any possibilty of uh that bill not to be passed the speaker\n<$A> The possibility is you know because the procedure is that\n<$B> Okay The only possibility to the best of my knowledge is uh that the President Ali Hassan Mwinyi to pass it the speaker to sign but if is there any other possibility\n<$A> Yeah because the President may not assent the bill and then he may send back the bill to the Parliament with reasons why he has not\n<$B> Is it likely to happen What do you think will President Ali hassan Mwinyi do\n<$A> I think President Ali Hassan Mwinyi now is in under He has got two things to decide or two masters One is the Zanzibaris or Zanzibar president He is under pressure that he knows the Zanzibaris are against\n<$B> that bill\n<$A> that bill At the same time he  knows that mainlanders are pro they are for the bill Therefore I don't know what he will decide then but in twenty-one days of course he has to and I think twenty-one days they are to elapse now Therefore he has to decide whether to assent it or not If he assents it then the Zanzibar president will be no longer the vice-president That would mean Zanzibar executive is not included in the union matters Therefore the point which you asked me when they said that there can be with the introduction of multiparty system there can be a possibilty of having a Zanzibar president hailing from Chadema and at the same time having the Tanzanian president hailing from CCM that is possible but saying that you we have to change the Act of the Union or the constitution because of that that is not it can't hold water because you have minimised the status of the Zanzibar president from being vice-president to being member of cabinet\n<$B> Yes but then there is someone else from Zanzibar\n<$A> Wait In the cabinet of course maybe the cabinet will be controlled by CCM too and then let us say the Zanzibar president  comes from Chadema will he accept the policy of the cabinet Therefore if you are primed for the contradiction you can't I mean avoid it even in the cabinet the contradiction will be there because the Zanzibar president may say that this I don't want this to be implemented in Zanzibar because this is against my policy I follow CUF policy or Chadema policy Therefore these are CCM policy which I don't believe in them therefore I don't want them to be implemented in Zanzibar Therefore if you are you areRRR frightened of I mean of contradiction the  contradiction> <+_contradictions> are still there Therefore what I think should be done We have to get rid of these two  systems I mean government  systems because if we are still having two governnment  systems the contradiction will be there because the question is not the structure of the Union I mean the problem is not the structure of the Union The structure of the Union is two  governments Zanzibaris they want two governments Mainlanders they don't want two governments They are for one government They are for three  governments Zanzibaris are against one government They are against three government I mean the CCM but they are for two governments they want two governments Therefore Zanzibar wants two governments When I say Zanzíbar it doesn't mean Zanzibaris I mean the executive they want two governments Mainlanders they want three governments They don't want two governments Therefore there is the contradiction Therefore what I say the issue is not two governments because if the issue is two  governments we have had the Union for thirty years Nineteen sixty-one there was a Tanganyika government The Tanganyika government is now incorporated in the Union government Therefore we have the Zanzibar government and we have the Union government We have two governments okay We have one government in two Tanzania the United Republic of Tanzania and Tanganyika government is incorporated in it and then on the other hand we have Zanzibar government Therefore if the issue is two  governments then you are Zanzibaris aren't you\n<$B>\n<$C> Yes\n<$A> Okay for thirty years we have been having Zanzibar government For thirty years Mainlanders have not been having a Tanganyika government therefore let us now change the system Let us say now it is the party it is high time that Zanzibar should dissolve Zanzibar government should be dissolved yeah\n<$A> It should be incorporated in the Union government and then we have Tanganyika government and then we should have two  governments Tanganyika government Tanzania government If the issue is two  governments then it will be all right because mainlanders will be satisfied They will have will haveRRR their own government but you are you prepared\n<$B> Well\n<$A> Are you prepared to see Zanzibar government being incorporated in Tanzania Union\n<$B> Well yes and no uh Basically because uh historically uh it was uh agreed or it was uh seen uh a good thing that Zanzibar government should be there and Tanganyika government should be dissolved uh precisely because of the smallness of the Zanzibar government and because of the all political and uh political situation of Zanzibar because in Zanzibar there was a revolution there so there was a fear that ih if the Zanzibar government is going to be dissolved and be uh incorporated in the Union government the status of Zanzibar will disappear\n<$A> Where is the status of Zanzibar now\n<$B> The Zanzibar government is still there whether you want or not though only theoretically it is there though theoretical just as a shadow a shadow government but it is there", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> Yeah So you'd want us to start our discussion uh uh Mr Beebwa with uh how it should be made that we have uh a syllabus A level syllabus uh containing things that should be taught throughout the year and then uh you want the assessment to be done I mean the tests to be set in such a way that they can offer a representative sample of what has been taught throughout the year I mean the course\n<$B> Yeah that's good\n<$A> But how is your experience regarding such kind of a thing How do you think questions or uh test items should be made so that they can be a sample of what has actually been covered throughout the course\n<$B> Yeah I asked this because it seems that to not encourage the student to continue with his study when sometimes fail because they cover much things in the whole course but the final they they're just answering four or five question which is at the end the exam\n<$X> Oh yes\n<$B> Then the student he occupy a lot of time much time to study many things then sometimes he can be panic for two  questions It seem that this two question it destroy all much which he have already learned from the beginning \n<$A> I see \n<$B> Then even the ministry it assess him that he is failed or sometimes he is not qualified to be a student or is not qualified in this subject \n<$A> I see\n<$B> but uh I think that it is not a fair system because it reminds a lot of things which you have read\n<$A> Sure That's quite true because well when uh a test is constructed uh should the person who is constructing the test items should take it into consideration that what he offers I mean what is contained in those test items should actually be a representative sample of what has been covered throughout the course and uh it is in this sense that uh we have a variety of test items For example we may have essay type question in the same examination At the same time you may have multiple choice questions and you also have matching items Okay All these offer a variety of chances to be I mean to cover as broader the material as possible so that you may not be biased because once you've set say three question essay type questions and actually it is one of the limitations of uh essay type questions that they are only restricted to a very small coverage you see of materials covered and generally when the examiner wants to make very crucial decisions about a candidate who is being examined tested he should not rely entirely on uh essay type questions because they are not enough to cover the broader area that might have been covered throughout the course So this is very bad and that's why you see them uh Form Four examinations uh uh They contain a lot of a variety of types I mean a variety of uh items that are structured differently like I have mentioned to you essay type multiple choice uh matching items and you know matching items can cover a very broader uh area isn't it \n<$B> yes\n<$A> But with A level actually I find it quite unfair to have such a you know to rely entirely on uh essay type questions it's quite unfair But how do you do your structure I mean what how do you uh do your examinations on structure I mean paper one How do you do youRRR go about doing it uh You also you are also given essays it's quite you can get the essays\n<$B> Of course I'm not familiar because I'm\n<$A> yeah yeah \n<$B> So\n<$A> But with structure I think it doesn't have any problem because you are getting you are provided with a sample you know a variety of questions on which you can uh well try to solve just like mathematics of course \n<$B> yes\n<$A> to provide the answers you see but uh with paper two it's some kind of a problem\n<$B> of course\n<$A> So what are your suggestions for example regarding such a situation\n<$B> yeah my suggestion is because the student he or she will remain in the course let's say one or two years Then they are taking a continuous assessment I think it is a good way to assess the student through a continuous assessment So you can know him or her when he is doing his continuous assessment then the teacher should be strict for that assessment because the final examination myself I saw that it's\n<$A> not so reliable \n<$B> not so reliable because sometimes as a human being the time of a examination maybe you can you can panic for that time Then you if you panic for two or one hour you  destroy everything for your two years or one years \n<$B> yeah it's true\n<$B> I think the better way I think so is to have a continuous assessment then it needs to be kept very well Then it can be considered\n<$B> to the end of the course \n<$A> That's a very good idea it's a very welcome idea in the sense that once you test someone and I uh mean you give him a final test a final exam uh without having his or her continuous report assessment I mean assessment report you never know exactly what has probably led him into passing excellently or into failing disastrously because remember a person doing a test is subjected into under some kind of abnormal situation where it's quite uh un un unlike when a person is doing his or her just normal tests class tests There we expect a student to be a bit more confident than when he's or she is doing his final exam you see uh I know the final exam given the situation that this holds quite a lot and people expect that the decisions that are going to be made out of such an exam will be very binding There is no way you can go and complain say well I did this and this and I wonder I have failed There is no such a chance So your idea that uh a continuous assessment should be taken very much into consideration is quite uh welcome and it's a good idea But it has been discovered that uh the National Examination Council for example NECTA does not uh care much about as I as far as my views are concerned does not take care of students' continuous assessment and if it does quite after finding that those there will be a need such a need because otherwise if that was the case we could have had many people maintaining their positions even after uh doing their final examinations Because you find that relying on such I mean on that method of just depending I mean making decisions on uh basing on national examinations have proved that some students can pass excellently while they used to perform poorly even in the class This is wonder So this brings some kind of concern that maybe there is cheating something like that or leakage of examinations something like that or maybe due to the fact that one can raise up very comfortable maybe he has or she has read something uh the topic which contains some of the questions uh overnight Yeah It could enable him pass even with very minimal efforts You see then you find that some people are doing it really serious work from the very beginning but since it is not easy to have all questions uh I mean all topics covered to appear in the same examination then it becomes too difficult for a student a candidate to make the right choice you see So that is quite a good point yeah So you are maybe you have something else to say\n<$B> Actually the final examination is something that is okay but uh when you see for example the final examination there are a lot of  students who are in mind sometimes not performed very well at the final examination then that is not to regard that it they were not okay in their development in studies but it occurred to the final examination that it can occur maybe some people at the final examination because they know that there is examination to concentrate in some topic and then sometimes it can appear in the national examination so they can do very good while the other who are very quite good from the beginning they didn't found that the topic in the final examination or they didn't study it very well one topic sometimes there can appear two question from one topic and then in the one who studied for examination he performed very well but the one who is not study very well but he is quite okay from the beginning up to there he failed So it occur that there it's like a golden chance now \n<$A> yes\n<$B> So when you dump there it's your chance now to get it but if it was not your luck for that day\n<$A> then you fail\n<$B> you fail but the real situation it is appear at school I think if they take you because you passed you have noticed that those who are going to high school or universities are noticed that they are only that they are bright there are a lot who are very bright in mind\n<$A> some who are not so bright sure\n<$B> I think another problem is to take care for continuous assessment\n<$A> yeah\n<$B> because sometimes the people they can or  teachers they can stay teaching then they know that there is a national examination They'll not keep or to consider very much as they want this continuous assessment then if it would go to the administration ministries and then to be regarded and then it can be <O/> even in the school for example our school When you come in form one before you come here you're supposed to do entrance examination of course Then when you come here also you make another examination after two or three weeks Then if you pass you continue you are allowed to continue if not you are chased out Then in your continuous assessment in one year they can chase you out from the school or you can continue according to your\n<$A> to your passes\n<$B> your passes\n<$A> exactly uh I can take you I can I mean I can understand what you are saying and uh in even more scholarly terms I could say the examinations that we have that we normally do are sometimes considered to be uh sort of an unfair game to scholars who would anticipate to go for further studies because it is also argued that paper pencil tests are meant to test people's ability to work under great pressures other than testing exactly what they know uh Because if you cannot have if you have no ability to work under pressures uh under time limit under very strict examination regulations you can never expect to go through such kind of an exercise So it's uh normally argued that there could be a different means different meansRRR of evaluating people's knowledge other than relying entirely on paper pencil examinations Because these it has been found out that may give a wrong picture of what really a person knows and what a person doesn't know you see Because suppose you have been given five questions uh out of the entire course uh of one year or two years I don't think those five questions could truly represent exactly what you know and what you have covered throughout and it means that failing to attempt those five questions out of a number of issues you have been discussing throughout the year could not be taken as a true picture of what you are as  academic intellectual because if you fail for example doesn't mean you know nothing getting F for instance could not exactly mean that you know nothing you are empty-headed It doesn't imply that way So even if you get A it doesn't mean you know everything that you have been taught You see that the merits of relying uh very much upon paper pencil examinations these are very misleading sometimes so some scholars have thought that there could be a certain mechanism of monitoring students' performance other than simply relying on what on paper pencil examinations For example a person could be monitored as you are saying through this continuous assessment even weekly assessment to test him on or her on various uh spheres of academics To test his thinking ability to test everything that could be uh part of his career Okay So that at the end of the course uh we find out what has been taking place with this candidate we are trying to uh to well assess uh I think that could offer a very reliable good picture of what is known to a student or what is and what is not known to him other than saying yeah now this is the end of your course you'll be doing your national examinations And this creates fear in itself Once you tell a person that you know there is final examination on which all the decisions about you are going to be based", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'c018e02c-290d-4081-8fd5-50cb6e59a0ac', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.224575+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': "<$A> Hello and welcome dear listeners to Investment and Trade in Tanzania The Tanzanian Tourist Board TTB has embarked on ambitious project to boost up tourism in the country Besides attracting more tourist to visit our country Tanzania the board  intends to classify or categorise some hotels that cater for tourists This was the message from the managing Director of TTB Mr Credo Sinyangwe to local journalists at the Dar es Salaam International Airport immediately after TTB boss had arrived at airport from Europe The TTB boss had been in Europe for promotion tour In this edition of Investment and Trade programme in Tanzania we'll bring you the first instalment of three  programmes in which Mr Credo Senyagwe outlines the highlight of his tour in Europe\n<$B> Fellow Tanzanians it is a pleasure to be back home to this great lovely country of fantastic people like yourselves When I was abroad I met a number of tour operators wholesalers retailers and so on They were all very excited about Tanzania as the coming new destination Many of them shared a viewpoint that really Tanzania is the best kept secret among the upcoming destinations So we have a lot to offer in terms of our attractions in terms of our culture our wonderful people One thing that became very obvious to me when we were speaking with people starting in Lisbon at the Aster Conference they all said they've been here before Then you ask them when They say in the early seventies So something happened between the early seventies and the early nineties Maybe we fell asleep a little bit and now we are waking up So we should wake this sleeping giant to roll again in the world of tourism So the rest of the world can count on us can expect the best that Tanzania is known to be offering We flew around Mount Kilimanjaro this morning It was magnificent Everybody says what a beautiful country you have They talk about Zanzibar our sister country They are very excited about Zanzibar the magical Zanzibar the spice island of Zanzibar the culture of Zanzibar the beaches of Zanzibar They are very very excited They talk of Ngorongoro Crater They talk of the Serengeti They talk of the migration I was in Paris the other day and we visited a museum movie presentation almost in three dimension they showed Serengeti That place has been full since six months ago everyday It's very difficult to get a ticket Its capacity is about seven hundred people so Tanzania is popular abroad The number of things that we feel must be done back at home most of which don't demand or require excessive resources Most of them are legislative Most of them are policy matters I think we should not delay a minute in moving right ahead in removing the obstacles that now face our industry One of them the visa issue the tourist visa issue Many of them said it's very difficult to obtain a tourist visa because you are not all over the world Tanzania is not well represented throughout the world so for many people who want to come to Tanzania it's a struggle I'll give you my own experience Before going to Portugal it demanded director of marketing presence in Nairobi for an interview He came back It demanded one of our tourist officers going back to Nairobi to get the stamp the visa stamp so with all that we started saying Mr Mwengua and myself maybe it's not worthwhile going to Portugal So you can imagine somebody who wants to spend a lot of money uh after having worked very hard for many years saved some money wants to come and see our wonderful country I think we can facilitate by removing the tourist visa and if we cannot for whatever reasons that are not known to us here we could require that on arrival When you arrive at Dar es Salaam Airport Kilimanjaro Airport Zanzibar Airport you get your visa right there No questions asked The days of checking for weaponry for spies and so on are really over Most of the world is trying to get together as one country Look at the European Union Even the conservative Sweden has joined in the European Union Look at America Canada Mexico So these are indications that we should learn from others as much as they learn from us You remember the days of <O/> Zambia Zimbabwe they all followed the good example of our father of the nation President Nyerere So now we should also learn from others We shouldn't have our head stuck in the sand as they say We should always research see what are the best strategies to improve our tourism And at the conference we met with Richard Branson He is the chairman and owner of uh Virgin Atlantic Airways We made a special request We invited him to Tanzania We said come and help us develop our tourism As you know uh a very important aspect of tourism is accessibility We've very few planes very few seats per year Now when you have very few seats from very few airlines like Air France KLM Ethiopian Airline and so on you cannot uplift so many people to your country You only have that much capacity So we spoke with Richard Branson specifically We spoke with Intercontinental Hotels I met a colleague of mine from Cornell University uh Mr Roger Kakuu who is now regional vice president of Intercontinental He was very very uh pleased to hear that we are inviting them back to this region and he said he will do whatever he can to help us I spoke to <name/> a chain of hotels These are people that President Castro himself invited to Cuba and now they have more than three thousand rooms in a matter of two years So we need to continue creating that uh enabling environment facilitate uh a number of investors in hotels in airlines infrastructure superstructure make it easier for these tourists to come to our country Currently our capacity is only about two hundred thousand tourists a year That is a very small number and that is the number of tourists who come to our country I can tell you today we can handle half a million and I think from the press release you have received there'll be tremendous increase in the number of tourists of this country I mean there is a figure here of forty per cent for the UK market but I can tell you today we had about two hundred thousand tourists last year or year before in ninety-three I think in ninety-four we'll have three hundred thousand and ninety-five four hundred thousand and by ninety-six we should reach half a million figure Now how can we prepare ourselves for that One we need to encourage the airlines of all kinds all charters whoever wants to come to Tanzania it's open-door open-skies welcome to Tanzania <ea/>Karibu Tanzania from wherever you are We'll make it easy We'll make it enjoyable for you We need to build more hotel rooms We don't have beach hotels in the mainland although we have plenty in Zanzibar So we need to encourage uh investors to come and build more hotels along our beaches We have more than eight hundred kilometres of beach and you only find two hundred or three hundred good hotel rooms That should not be allowed to continue We should immediately relax obstacles encourage investors from all over the world I met a very interesting uh tour operator who already has hotels has charters to Kenya He's called Franco Rosso a company from Italy I met uh Mr Franco Rosso himself his son and daughter They invited me to dinner and said Credo we want to come to Tanzania he said in Italian I said welcome to Tanzania Come to my office Mr Gamba <ea/>Mama <name/> and all the other managers are at your disposal We'll facilitate If we need to see Minister of Lands we'll see him If we need to see uh IPC uh Mr Kahama we'll see him If we need to see uh National Parks we'll see them These are all Tanzanians interested in the economic uh betterment future of our people So we are all as a team in this country So going back to our WTM some of the successes we have had I think we did a better showing there People liked our stand which was half the size of Kenya People were very excited There was tremendous business There were so many tour operators Some of them were not even part of our team They just came and said may we participate So although fourteen of us went but we had about twenty of them who came and said I belong to Tanzania I've a tour company in Tanzania We said but you haven't paid He said I'll pay on the spot so they paid cash there to belong to participate So a good news next year instead of fifty square metres that we had this year we will have two hundred square metres of space That's four hundred per cent of the current space we took We asked them to give us a central position So I would like to say uh uh fellow Tanzanians brothers and sisters we have a good product we have a great country and we have good people tremendous economic potential Let's make the best use of them Let us not allow anyone to obstruct our progress our economic growth I think destiny is in our hands so you have a role to play in informing our public that tourism is good We have a role to play in discussing with uh Minister of Foreign Affairs Home Affairs to relax the tourist visa Minister of lands to create zones specific zones which will go hand in hand with a tourism masterplan for the development of tourist resorts or tourist infrastructure superstructure and so on So the good news is I think we are moving right ahead Tanzania Tourist Board would like to officially announce we have reached a cruising speed and cruising height and we have not gone to automatic pilot yet but uh I can say in a few months we can go to automatic pilot So I welcome you on board We are part and parcel of uh our economic development I welcome you on board I want you to play the best you can the best role you can in informing our people our leaders we would like you to also inform our minister in the treasury that we need the money I give an example Malta a small place in the Mediterranean is going to spend in the UK market alone one million pounds Our budget for the year is about one million dollars So far this year we have not received a cent yet So these are things you need to appeal on our behalf on behalf of this country Please give the funds to TTB to do its job They've given us the job We have a mandate We are doing this in the national interest Please don't tie our hands Give us the means Success is not just ours Success is for the country for the people of this country I thank you very much with those few words uh I'll be open to any questions Feel free I'm excited to be with you as always and I look forward to working with you very closely now and in the future thank you very much\n<$C> Maybe Can you be a little bit more specific about the uh benefits that this country is going to get from this visit of yours which you have just come back \n<$B> One thing we made abundantly clear to whoever we met is that Tanzania as a country our government and its policy has already accepted tourism as a very important sector very important economic sector We informed them that we are excited we are eager to welcome them back to Tanzania in tourism projects of any kind to work with us in building hotels in bringing more airlines talk of charters of scheduled flights", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'bb82bd88-50db-4559-b52a-ba05b1c8d4f0', 'added':

{'text': "<$A> Hello listeners welcome again to our quarter hour programme of African development This is a programme which discusses the economic political and cultural development of African countries Also it features the economic development of regional or sub-regional groupings in the continent of Africa Our programme this week looks at the recent history of Sudan and its economic development Stay tuned \n<$B> Sudan is generally a flat featureless plain reflecting the proximity to the surface of the ancient little-disturbed basement rocks of the African continent The democratic Republic of Sudan is a vast country which covers an area of two million five hundred and five thousand eight hundred and thirteen square kilometres and the Nile waters which enter Sudan just south of Ajuba either evaporates or flows three thousand kilometres until they reach Lake <name/> on the Egyptian border Borders surrounding the country are Egypt Libya Ethiopia Chad Central Africa Kenya and Uganda Sudan has a population of over eighteen point nine million people according to UN estimates of nineteen eighty-one The capital of the country is Khartoum \n<$A> According to recent history of Sudan its geographical position between the Mediterranean Middle East and Central Africa has played an important part determining the character and the politics of the country since the Biblical times In almost all the contacts between Sudan and the outside world Egypt has been the most important link and especially since the rise of Islam the dominant one \n<$B> British rule was also extended to Sudan when the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of eighteen ninety-nine laid the foundations of the new regime in Sudan This agreement was nominally Anglo-Egyptian but was actually a British colonial administration headed by a Governor General in which all military authority was vested Sudan achieved independence in nineteen fifty-five Changes of governments took place with the problem of the southern Sudan which was inherited from the British colonial administration of which a search for a permanent constitution of the country is yet to be found \n<$A> Despite many years of development efforts Sudan remains primarily an agricultural and pastoral country Agriculture contributes forty per cent of the Gross Domestic Product and its <O/> produces over ninety per cent of total exports which also employs about eighty per cent of the economically active population The manufacturing sector is still small and it contributed about six per cent of the Gross Domestic Product in nineteen eighty-one eighty-two Exploration for petroleum has resulted in commercially exploitable finds It was planned that by nineteen eighty-six the country would have exported petroleum thus giving the country hope that some of its crippling problems could be solved However the deteriorating security situation in the south where most of the commercially exploitable deposits of petroleum are located has raised a major question mark over these plans \n<$B> Main cash crops of Sudan are cotton which is the main cash crop and its exports can reach up to seventy per cent of total agricultural exports Others are groundnuts and sorghum The country's dependence on one major export crop especially cotton with wide fluctuations in price and quantity exported has caused political as well as economic instability in the country With such a traditional agricultural sector it is not surprising that Sudan has a low income per head which was estimated by the World Bank to be US dollars four hundred and forty in nineteen eighty-two The average density of population is low and there is no population pressure on the available resources In fact Sudan suffers from shortage of labour particularly during the cotton-picking season The country is large with large unproductive areas\n<$A> The availability of water is the governing factor for agriculture in Sudan In most parts of the rain lands of Sudan drinking water for humans and animals is a crucial factor especially before the <O/> season when land is prepared for cultivation and after it during harvest season The cultivable land is estimated to be about eighty-four million hectares and only eight per cent of this land is being utilised in agriculture and about two million hectares are under irrigation using Nile waters To the Nile Waters Agreement of nineteen fifty-nine the distribution of water between Sudan and Egypt was governed by an agreement of nineteen twenty-nine which allocated four thousand million cubic metre of water to Sudan\n<$B> Cotton is the most important crop in the Sudan from the economic point of view being the major export chief foreign exchange earner and main generator of income for the country Three main types of cotton are grown The long staple <name/> for the export market the medium staple <name/> and the rain-fed short staples The difference in the cotton is seen in the cotton fibres The main cereal crop is sorghum commonly known as <afr/>duna in Sudan It is the most important staple food and it is mainly grown in the rain lands Excellent harvests during the year nineteen eighty-one and nineteen eighty-two have encouraged the development of sorghum into an increasingly important export crop In nineteen eighty-two sorghum aimed earned the Sudan Sudan pounds one hundred and seven million for its export to Saudi Arabia Wheat is grown mainly as a cash crop but with urbanisation and social developments the consumption of bread made out of wheat flour by the Sudanese people is increasing at the rate of ten per cent annually \n<$A> Products like the groundnuts <O/> rice sugar cane maize are also being produced in Sudan on a reasonable quantity Sudan has an animal wealth which contributes on average about ten per cent of Gross Domestic Product annually In nineteen eighty-three it was estimated that the country had nineteen point six million cattle nineteen point five million sheep twelve point nine million goats and two point five million camels Also production of milk was estimated to be over one million point five metric tonnes and meat was four hundred fifty-one thousand and fifty metric tonnes The share of live animals hides and skins in total export increased by from two per cent in nineteen seventy-five seventy-six to almost <O/> per cent in nineteen eighty-two However this percentage was not expected to increase as the domestic consumption of this commodity continues to increase at a faster rate Also the government restricted the export of animal products in order to satisfy the local market\n<$B> As far as the industrial sector was concerned the dealing of cotton encouraged the beginning of industry in Sudan early in the country With the expansion of cotton production the number of ginning factories also increased until the <name/> board alone has the largest ginning enterprise  under single management in the world There are twenty-five spinning and textile factories Groundnuts are also partly processed with oil and cake dominating exports Minerals such as copper iron mica and chromite are exported in the crudest form With the exception of soap soft drinks and oil processing industries large industries manufacturing import substitutes started only after nineteen sixty Following the shift of the economy in favour of more mixed economy more of the industries in Sudan were sold to the private sector \n<$A> The private sector has played an important role in the industrial development of the country In the period nineteen sixty sixty-nine the private sector invested Sudan pounds thirty-six point nine million in industry The bulk of the investment has gone into the textiles soap oil-pressing sixteen hundred <O/> industries By the nineteen seventies the role of the private sector had increased The government has encouraged industrialisation by giving generous concessions to infant industries A new encouragement of investment act was introduced at the end of nineteen eighty repealing the previous investment laws This act offered tax incentives such as <O/> land acquisition customs exemptions and favourable freight and electricity charges \n<$B> Since nineteen seventy-three international companies have shown an increasing interest in exploring for petroleum in the Sudan More than eighty per cent of available concessions were allocated and companies working in the Sudan including Standards Oil began to increase Potential government earnings from petroleum exports were estimated at dollars two hundred million annually in December nineteen eighty-two The oil pipeline between Port Sudan and Khartoum was completed in nineteen seventy-seven It is designed for the transport of motor gasoline gas-oil and kerosene including aviation turbine fuel It has a capacity of six thousand hundred metric tonnes with a length of about eight hundred and fifty kilometres Chrome mining was being developed and a feasibility study into off-shore minerals in the Red Sea showed considerable deposits of iron ore zinc copper and silver and these were to be exploited jointly with Saudi Arabia \nWith that item we have come to the end of this week's programme of African development Join us again next week for another edition", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$A> Welcome again to another edition of You and the Environment Today we'll look at the role of local government in environmental conservation and implementing sustainable development in Tanzania Stay tuned It is a known fact that local governments they are playing an important role in implementing many of the activities which aim to improve the living standards of the people But how far local governments have been fully involved in the conservation of the environment This is another important area which needs to be well conserved in order to implement sustainable development in Tanzania Now what is the major role of local government in environmental conservation Before we dwell on what local governments are supposed to do one must first understand why local governments were created as Mr Lawrence Kilimikwo from the Journalists Environmental Association of Tanzania JEAT explains\n<$B> In essence local governments were created for two reasons First to enhance democracy at the grass roots level and second to to propel people's participation in identifying discussing planning and implementing matters that affect their local lives In essence local governments were created for that purpose as I have already said The issue is that local the local people face local problems which are different from the other local communities and therefore they need  specific and local  solutions The creation of a local government is intended to to cater for that particular aspect \n<$A> In this aspect Mr Kilimikwo says local government should know what type of life local people are living because environmental conservation and development are interrelated\n<$B> The issue's that these two are so interwoven they are so interlinked that you cannot talk of development without talking about environmental conservation It is through the environment that people are making their own living It is through the environment through It's by destroying or improving the the environment that the community can either develop or underdevelop Now local government what does it entail Local government means that first they have to know what type of life they are leading Are they fishermen Are they headers Are they agriculturalists or whatever the case It depends what type of life that particular local communities are leading If they are farmers then they had to involve the farmers themselves to know what type of farming methods are particularly in can lead to sustainable environment in their areas because in most these cases it has happened that there are traditional farming practices which have been practised ever since from time immemorial and these were pertinent to that particular time but I see the changes These people are supposed to change over time but now the problem is that the so-called extension officers the so-called central government whatever the case have been imposing uniform solutions to different problems at different localities We all need to review and that's where the local government comes in because as I have already said different localities have got different problems and that's why you cannot pump farming solutions to problems which are affecting fishermen Likewise you cannot pump from the top solutions for problems affecting miners mining communities to people who are dealing with harvesting say honey in forests We need specific problems Their problems are different Their  ways of living are different Their cultural <O/> of life are also different So there's that question of sociological looking aspect \n<$A> I think there is inadequate public awareness about environmental issues Mr Jumo Ngasongwa Personal Assistant to the President's Office Economic Affairs says one of the critical  roles of local government should be to expand awareness because they are nearer to the people \n<$C> Local governments as institutions are nearer to the people where actually the environment is or where the environmental problems are and therefore they have a very critical role to play in terms one of expanding awareness uh among the communities the people with whom they are living together uh to understand that the environment is a very important aspect in their development \n<$A> Another aspect according to Mr Ngasonga is to mobilise funds for environmental projects\n<$C> The local government as institutions have another uh important aspect in that uh they can mobilise resources uh resources which uh they can be utilised in uh implementing uh environmental projects which uh ensure that the environment is conserved uh Of course I do know that uh most local government institutions are constrained by a number of uh problems One manpower two financial resources uh three uh transport facilities But uh if we as a nation can mobilise our resources and make these resources available to the districts then they will be undertaking in a very most effective manner those activities which ensure to conserve the environment\n<$A> The District Executive Director for Muheza Mr Diwani Omari Mzina says that the possible way to enable local government to fulfil their obligations and thus implement sustainable development is to strengthen the functions at the district level\n<$D> I think the local government has a lot to play in sustaining conservation If you take our story in the past I think we had uh by-laws in the district councils which were dealing with preservation of soil uh of water sources and forests but uh when you get to the new system of decentralisation I think most of the by-laws were ignored and nobody cared in fact what was happening I think if that at present we need to conserve uh soil forests and so forth we need to strengthen uh the function at the local government at district level especially the staff their working implements and the by-laws uh creating by-laws which are dealing with conservation and then after initiating the by-laws and when they are already passed you need the machinery for enforcement and a great problem which we are getting now is uh the enforcement machinery You can have the by-law for conservation but you don't have the machinery to make sure that by-laws are being adhered to \n<$A> However Mr Maisala Mbezi District Executive Director for Nachingwea says the role of local government as far as environmental conservation is concerned is great but to enable them work properly the revenue collected from natural resources should be given to local governments\n<$E> As we all know local governments cover all the country and in the districts actually it's where we have a great number of the local people who in fact are required or are needed to contribute much in the environmental conservation strategy or policy In doing so uh the local people will contribute much by using their own efforts and the council in its on its side will use some revenue from its own sources to boost the efforts of the people But what is important to be emphasised here is that the revenue collected by the central government from these natural resources some small amount maybe twenty-five per cent or twenty of the whole collection should be given to the local authorities so that this money can be used in this specifically marked effort of making sure that the environmental conservation policy package is a success\n<$A> Mr Abdalla Abdi Executive Director for Ileje district supports the idea of setting aside more funds for conservation measures and also suggests that the councils should solicit funds from the international organisations\n<$F> I think the government should allocate more funds from the budgetary uh allocations Instead of the twenty-five per cent being given it should be raised to twenty-five to fifty per cent and also councils should solicit more funds from donor agencies In Ileje we have DANIDA and the EEC to finance some of these projects for conservation purposes\n<$A> Mr Alan Kijavi working with the Ngorongoro conservation area authority also had some few comments to make regarding the role of local government in environmental conservation\n<$G> So far as I know most of the conservation efforts which are geared towards environmental protection have been failing in the past few years mainly because we didn't involve the local communities concerned It is now that we have realised that mistake and that we are now trying to tune ourselves to go into those local communities and involve them in the whole process of protecting the environment and in such a way the only way we can work easily with the local communities is to involve the local governments concerned because they are the ones who are working for the people and they are the ones who know the problems of the people and they are the ones who can assist us in implementing the strategies that have been proposed in the national conservation strategy for sustainable development So I think that by working with the local government we will make this whole exercise I mean successful Otherwise if you work in isolation as it has previously been then I'm sure the whole strategy will end up a failure\n<$A> But some people are complaining that the goal of local governments in environmental conservation cannot be achieved because of lack of funds Let's hear Mr Kijavi Lupia \n<$H> Well so far as I see it is that the people themselves have to play a role in implementing the national conservation strategy for sustainable development wherever possible\nI think that people will contribute using their own initiatives and their own sources of funds while the central government can finance them with more funds to implement some of the major activities but I as I know that people if they are willing to implement the conservation strategy then will be able to mobilise themselves and implement those issues which can be accommodated within their main financial positions and their powers to implement\n<$A> On the other hand people believe that local governments can do well in implementing sustainable development if they establish co-ordination that is for example formation of environmental committees in the village government to control and effectively use our natural resources The Biharamulo District Executive Director Mr Herbert Nyamugali supports the idea\n<$I> So far environment has been taken for granted Trees are being cut water sources are being spoilt There are <O/> bush fires every dry season and all sorts of destruction But if every village government was held responsible to protect the environment then we think people would be sensitised and would understand their role in the preservation of nature and conserving it So I think it is pertinent to the local governments to have different committees starting at the district level going all the way to the village governments and the formation of village environmental committees which would uh uh play the a role of preserving nature by different mechanisms say by having village by-laws and enforcing them so that everybody knows his role in the preservation of nature\n<$A> Masasi District has not been very much affected by environmental degradation However the Executive Director of that area Mr Mbwija Tela Malende has something to contribute on the issue of local government\n<$J> It's my sincere uh stand that the local governments are very much uh the appropriate authorities to handle this uh soil conservation or whatever to bring about sustainable development because they are the bodies which are very close to the people and they exactly know the problems concerning the conservation problems in the areas and because of that I think they have their role to play uh What local authority will do will of course depend very much on the local conditions which in one way or the other affect soil conservation and things like that uh As for my district I would say right away we don't have very serious uh degradation problems but however there are areas where the authority has to play a part especially uh things like uh bush fires They are quite common in Masasi District uh There is this problem of shifting agriculture which has been associated with the uh programme of Ondoa Njaa in Masasi in short Onjama and uh in the near future maybe cattle might also bring some  problems However we are already aware of this and we intend to take some uh regional measures as soon as possible\n<$A> Some local communities they've already started conservation measures because they know that is part of their responsibilities A good example is Ileye district As Mr Abdalla Abdi confirmed\n<$F> We have already started conservation measures RRR in my district and uh particularly in the tree planting and conservation of what are source areas by damming the rivers and also by constructing water intakes", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$A> Welcome listeners to yet another half hour of Meeting of the Minds In this week's edition we feature World Leprosy Day commemorations Saturday the twenty-eighth nineteen ninety-five the Tanzania Leprosy Association marked the World Leprosy Day by a seminar which was held at the Muhimbili Medical Centre which was officiated by Honourable Zakia Meghji the Minister of Health In her opening remarks Zakia Meghji urged joint efforts towards elimination of leprosy which has ceased to be endemic There are some two point four million sufferers in seventy-nine countries with significant number of cases as Doctor Ipugi the programme manager narrates as he presents the global leprosy situation and the World Health elimination strategy\n<$B> Leprosy is a disease with profound causing profound disability and uh deformities and these are the ones which cause it to be feared and to uh to let the communities to ostracize its uh victims Now before nineteen eighty when MDT was uh instituted the leprosy was a big problem But now after MDT the treatment which has proved effective cases are going down If we look the first transparency please if we look at the leprosy burden at the current time uh there are about two point two million cases in the world which are spread in seventy-nine endemic countries and their registered prevalency of leprosy is about four per ten thousand population Of these uh cases most of them are distributed in subtropical out uh in the subtropics as you will see in the later transparencies And about six hundred thousand cases are detected each year By nineteen ninety-four it is admitted that there are between two to three million people who are disabled with the leprosy The next the as I said the group of pictures here shows that the most of the cases are below The next one please The most of the leprosy patients occur below the uh in the subtropical belt So both in America uh Africa Southeast Asia and uh the Western Pacific Uh the next most of the patients as we said are in the Southeast Asia region as you can see in the transparency there and in Africa for nineteen ninety-four there were only one hundred and thirty-seven two hundred and forty-nine cases The coverage of treatment by MDT which is the most effective treatment for leprosy to date ranges from uh forty-seven per cent to ninety-four The highest uh uh highest coverageRRR has been in the Southeast Asia uh in uh the lowest coverages are in Southeast Asia and uh in Europe but uh you see in Africa uh East Mediterranean and the Western Pacific are the ones which achieved much higher coverage net uh uh coverages The completion of treatment by MDT by that year six more than six and a half million almost six and a half million people had been treated by MDT which gave a cumulative coverage of ninety-one point seven Now if you look on the case detection which the figures for nineteen ninety-three next show that still Southeast Asia detected much more of the new cases half a million while uh Africa as you can see it was just below forty uh thousand cases So the case detection rate ranges from thirty-five per cent to less than one per cent and as you will see in the WHO uh strategy letter on what they uh intend you can see that to reach a case detection of uh one per uh one per ten thousand well some of the countries are much uh below that\nNow I would like to look in detail of some of the statistics which are prevalent in Africa In uh in anglophone Africa as you can see we have uh the prevalence per ten thousand ranges from uh as low as in Kenya and in South Africa which all have reached the elimination phase of the WHO which is defined as uh less than one case per ten thousand population or ten cases per hundred thousand population and while other countries like Liberia uh uh uh are still in a much bigger problem And patients on MDT or MDT coverage you can see Tanzania uh South Africa Kenya Ghana Ethiopia and uh we have achieved a hundred per cent coverage while others like Liberia is much much lower Now in order to achieve the elimination strategy the WHO set uh World Health Assembly set uh prevalence rate of one per ten thousand and because knowing that leprosy is a disease of patchy distribution which means that the uh number of cases vary from country to country or even within the country And therefore the strategy to eliminate leprosy differ from community to community And this is the grouping of the countries in the world which has been made and group one uh which has only one case at this moment it's India and is defined as countries with the more than a million cases of leprosy while you go down to group five which uh have eliminated leprosy as a public uh problem Now group one to three are the ones where WHO is concentrating its efforts in eliminating leprosy because they have not yet eliminated uh the leprous as a public problem And uh while in the group four which Tanzania belonged in that group are the cases which would eliminate leprosy if the current activities of uh combating  leprosy are maintained So it's important that we know we are in that group and we have to maintain the current uh situation This grouping is based on both uh epidemology that's the number of cases as well as operation issues like coverage of multi-drug therapy Now if you see the next transparency The next transparency shows just in brief the the names of the countries which are involved in those uh groups and as I said Tanzania is in group four so what we are the WHO is concentrating now is in the top twenty-five countries The next and in those top twenty-five countries because we're in Africa I wanted just to look more in detail the African countries which are uh involved and in our close south you see Mozambique and that's why you find in Tanzania cases from Mtwara we have much much higher uh cases than the other regions It's because Mozambique is still in those\nThis just tries to give again an overview of the whole uh registered cases in nineteen ninety-four So ladies and gentlemen this is the global situation of the  leprosy situation in the world Now as I said the WHO uh decided to set the target of eliminating leprosy by nineteen uh two thousand in uh the year two thousand because it was found to be quite feasible Especially if efforts to spread MDT are maintained in all countries and uh we achieve a hundred per cent coverage Now a number of priorities were set which would assure that leprosy is uh eliminated The first one or the first and foremost is the political commitment of the countries which are involved in eliminating leprosy and one of the actions they have to do is to set a plan of action which indicates uh what activities are going to be done to achieve the elimination The actions which have to be taken is first to identify which problems we have That's uh to see the big the size of the problem and where it is concentrated And that's why we look at the registered prevalence of the cases and the absolute numbers as well as the rate Then you have to estimate the prevalence This is a very difficult in leprosy because we do not have a good criteria to estimate the number of cases in the community But the annual case detection rate is a very useful measure because those countries which have an established programme would show the numbers which they are detecting each year and with the population you can get the rate or the case detection rate Uh the estimated listing also is difficult to ascertain After knowing which size of the problem then you have then you have to ensure that leprosy control services are delivered properly and the MDT coverage which is uh low in some countries has to be improved and because some areas have uh low assessed <O/> I mean the services are not well distributed You must make sure that these are available to all uh people and it depends on the health services you are using like in Tanzania we are using all the health services from the dispensaries to the hostels that's why we have a much wider coverage In some or in the past when the leprosy specialised leprosy hostels were used this was a bit uh difficult Then you have to look at social factors as uh some of our participants are going to talk about which increase maybe uh stigma or reduce the uh uh ability of the patients to come forward should be addressed also the community awareness should be increased so that people come forward for treatment\nthen after the following have to be uh ensured to occur so that we eliminate I've mentioned political commitment then we have also to mobilise ressources And this is where the co-operation of the government the non-governmental  organisations and the donor communities like uh in this case uh in our case the German Leprosy Relief Association is important and then because the uh uh leprosy elimination strategies cannot occur in isolation we must make sure that our health services in general are better organised and consolidated so that we can maintain the current uh uh strategies we use in elimination in controlling leprosy Then the programme the activities in the programme should look at uh the information which they have In the past before the MDT was introduced patients used to be treated for life So the registers were showing cumulative numbers of patients So we have to identify which are really the registered patients We should not count also patients who've been cured but they have disabilities So we have to clean the registers It means remove those who do not require treatment And uh this in countries like Tanzania has been achieved because all our registers now register only new patients and uh each year we count which number of patients we have This will be presented by my colleague in a few moments \nThen after getting our information all countries who are uh looking forwards to eliminating  leprosy should now ensure that all are being treated with MDT and we must ensure that we have enough drugs to give them And this because they're expensive for countries like uh Tanzania and the other low income countries have again to look to the donor community and uh to make sure that you get the drug Getting the drug in the country might not be a problem The problem might be to distribute it to the patients those who need And therefore the countries should ensure that those drugs really reach the patients As the minister has mentioned in her speech that our health services must ensure that those services really reach the people So when we will get the drugs in the store we keep them and uh showing the register that we have the drugs is not enough and we have to listen when patients complain that they don't have drugs look at our system what mistakes we have to rectify to ensure that uh the drugs are there and this is the only thing which will motivate the donor community to continue assisting us Now when you are treating the patients now that is the problem of detection You have to ensure that your patient comes for treatment and completes the treatment He can only complete the treatment if you handle them properly you respect them and explain to them the rationale of the long treatment in these diseases and they should be able to uh continue coming for treatment And once you have achieved those to two uh number two point two and number two point three then you can aim at improving case detection Because if you improve case detection without ensuring that those which you are going to detect are going to be treated you'll be wasting much of your time Then knowing that leprosy is a disease which is associated with disability we must ensure that uh disabilities are prevented both in uh uh primary prevention and secondary prevention because most of our health personnel health care personnel are of middle and lower cadres We must prepare simplify the guidelines which enable them to detect treat and prevent disabilities particularly nerve damage uh in leprosy patients Then there are activities which have to be initiated which are to support these contra activities The most important is training but uh as others said if you have not yet started training you can start the implementing while training We do not to start training all the workers and then start implementing And then we must set therefore a system especially for uh things like uh disability care You must know where the patient if he's such a problem will be referred from a dispensary level up to a consultant hospital level like Muhimbili Medical Centre Because our main aim is to rehabilitate these people and to return them to their community we must at this stage initiate counselling of both the patient the family and the communities And these are the activities which cannot be done by the people in the programme alone but when even either uh health workers the media personnel as uh uh the ministers there have told them in the this gathering they should we should all aim at counselling the families to accept the patients And finally to improve uh case detection it's very important that the community is aware of does not forget the signs of leprosy Because as leprosy goes down people will uh health personnel will start seeing less and less patients and will tend to forget how leprosy is presenting and therefore we should continue to improve the awareness in the community After we have we have set the elimination strategy in motion we should evaluate our activities and this includes problem monitoring and evaluation which we are always doing in our control programmes looking at the case detection rate how they're increasing or decreasing and uh how case holding means treatment of the patient completing treatment and cure Cure is uh uh progressing also disability grade if they are increasing or decreasing You will see in a few moments when Doctor Mwengi presents about the situation in our country Then we have to maintain awareness of the disease in the community This uh is WHO elimination target which uh is set from nineteen ninety-three to nineteen ninety-four At the moment in nineteen ninety-four we are behind the schedule because the it was planned that it should be reduced to seventy per cent but there were still seventy-nine uh uh seventy-nine countries So those countries which were planning or had planned at that time to eliminate leprosy some of them are behind schedule and they are still continuing the activities The number of cases should have progressed <O/> that year but as I told you in that uh year there were admitted two point two million cases So we are still uh lagging uh behind MDT coverage is also still behind but uh I hope in the next uh next five years or so we might be able to reach the proposed coverage\n<$A> That was Doctor Ipugi narrating the global leprosy situation and the WHO elimination strategy", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> Among topical issues and events of the week Honourable <name/> minister for community development women and children of <name/> television programme RIPOA leprosy control programme in the country gets under way with a philosophical commitment To present the Radio Magazine programme I'm Florian <name/> behind the microphone Stay tuned\nA long term research on poverty alleviation RIPOA programme was officiated on Friday tenth February nineteen ninety-five by Honourable <name/> minister for community development women and children at the Kilimanjaro Hotel in Tanzania Room The research on poverty alleviation RIPOA programme is a not for profit NGO registered under the laws of Tanzania on the thirtieth November nineteen ninety four The establishment of RIPOA programme reflects two main concerns One is that poverty issues should not be seen as just another thing for which academics and others can obtain a research funding Poverty and its eradication are among the major global issues of our time Sustainable poverty reduction has been one of Tanzania's major development goals Moreover poverty eradication is bound up with other fundamental development issues including combatting <O/> inequality and the misuse of the earth's natural resources Thus a research on poverty in Tanzania should bring Tanzanian researchers into global networks of concern with all our futures to the extent that poverty in Tanzania can be considered as stemming from international inequalities e g trade regime debt <O/> poverty research should be undertaken within a global framework SICOM current research capacity in Tanzania has been adversely affected by the growing preference among academics for shprt term consultancy work over long term and less well paid research work Thus in spite of the increase in the absolute number of PhD holders both locally and foreign trained and effective research capacity in the country has stagnated No doubt low salaries and the poor working environment help explain this unsatisfactory state of affairs But institutional weaknesses especially institutional failure to exercise great initiative in articulating a coherent and focussed long term research agenda are also to blame These concerns call persuasive for the need to build and strengthen additional local research capacity The establishment of ripoa as long term programme is expected to contribute to meeting this need Effective policy making depends to a large extent upon a viability and accessibility of well researched accurate consistent and good quality data To the extent that research is capable of generating such information it helps to enhance capacity and to provide the means for appropriate knowledge The ripoa programme is <O/> being sponsored by the Netherlands government Its secretariat is housed in the <name/> building along <name/> Road <name/> area Dar es Salaam Tanzania official launching of the programme was expected to take place at the Kilimanjaro Hotel and it was done on RRR on the tenth February nineteen ninety-five In a later forum the minister for science technology and higher education Honourable Benjamin Mkapa told his Dutch  colleague the minister for development cooperation Honourable Jean <name/> immediately after the January nineteen ninety-four workshop of the <name/> in Tanzania Honourable Mkapa wrote to express that I  am honoured to open the workshop I decided to sit through it and participate It presented a most unique opportunity to review our concepts of poverty and development to measure our claims of success in poverty alleviation to assess the links between research fund managers and those in both government and the NGO private sector who make development happen We had extensive discussions about areas of priority and their linkage and we had a refreshing recognition of the issue of environment protection and a gender analysis and at the end we were able to build a consensus about and outline a structure for a programme of research into poverty alleviation I feel convinced that we shall be able to put bricks and mortar to that outline in the next few months Earlier on when opening the workshop Honourable Mkapa had he had this to say I take this opportunity to express the government's gratitude to the government to the Netherlands for the offer of fund and research on poverty alleviation in Tanzania This will go a long way towards facilitating the task of addressing the concerns on poverty I have raised Future plans are under way for leprosy control in the country in which problems concerning the matter are being discussed Mr John O'Brian of <name/> leprosy project under the support of International School of Tanzania has been in the country for three and a half years now details the philosophical commitment to community service programme especially the ones carried out in Dar es Salaam \nHowever future plans on leprosy control in Tanzania mostly in urban centres equally in Coastal region are also under way \nPresident Ali Hassan Mwinyini on Saturday February the twelfth launched a national campaign against drug business to be undertaken by a special unit The unit comprises members from the police force immigration customs international security and <O/> The head of state directed the unit to prepare an action plan and appointed members for the unit He also asked it to revisit the laws and international coventions on drugs before the coming <O/> session He called upon the unit to work strictly and to punish all the culprits which includes confiscating or confiscation of all property involved in this business The president cushioned that this nasty business affecting lives of people should be rooted out in which case the public should be involved Despite tarnishing the image of the nation the President noted that drug business adversely affects the national economy Given the intensity of the problem the President suggested that neighbouring countries as well as the international community should be incorporated in the campaign The occasion was also attended by the minister for home affairs Mr Ernest <name/> <title/>

{'text': "<$A> In this edition Minister of Health Zakia Meghji opens a special workshop for journalists which examined best ways of covering health issues of mothers and children by both print and electronic media The workshop coordinated by Anna <name/> was organised by the Tanzanian Media Women Association health unit\n<$B> Health must act as a watchdog When we talk of undernutrition environmental degradation industrial waste drugs we must relate it to health Health is a social economic political and a human phenomenon Now mass media is another watchdog Journalists and regular reporters must ensure that information and the right and correct information reaches the public Such information should be well presented so that it can sensitize mobilize and challenge policy makers international agencies health personnel non-governmental organizations women's groups the community and community leaders individuals in the public to take action You can name it all <O/> but it has to challenge to give information to take action on various issues affecting the health of the two groups that is the women and the children Information must also be correct analytical and geared towards effecting things If wrong information is given then it has a negative effect This is because media people have worked very closely with organizations dealing with Aids be it governmental non-governmental or private So the media has played a big role it has educated the people to understand how Aids was caused how it is <O/> how it can be avoided and that's <O/> for Aids If media comes up and says that there is cure for Aids it will mean that all efforts by different organizations will be wasted If media comes up and says <O_><O/> then it will mean that all the exercise that we have done together be it the government the non-governmental organizations and the media it will mean that all is wasted because the people look up to the media and they listen to the media and they can change because of the media However in order that correct information is given there is need for ministries and organizations concerned to be ready to give information This is very basic that information must be given Sometimes some of us leaders were afraid of media When you hear that there is a journalist outside your office you tell the secretary tell them I'm not here you know It is wrong I think you know it is very wrong that media people must have information and must have access to information Then only they can do their work But if you don't give them information they have to write then they will write any information that they can lay their hands on Now there is a lot of information in the country and outside the country and of which if we can be able to share with the media people then it can mean that this information can be well utilized As I have pointed out earlier development is measured through the position of women As journalists you should use your pens as grenades to portray in a right and meaningful way the status of women and children In Tanzania women and children's health is currently addressed through several policy documents and initiatives These include the National Population Policy March nineteen ninety-two the State Motherhood <O/> for Tanzania the Policy for Women and Children the Situation of Children in Tanzania the National Aids Control Programme Expanded Programme Organization and others Donor agencies for have also played a major role in women and health issues for example UNICEF UNSTA WHO and so on It is important when dealing with women's and children's health to look into all this and also to look at government contributions in terms of the budget And the standard situation in Tanzania is so but what I'm saying is that the budget of health is still low And that is why we have introduced other measures one of which is this cost sharing because to fill in to try to fill in it won't fill in all the gaps We'll do something but we won't be able to fill in all the gaps Therefore community involvement is very central when we talk of sustainability of programmes And uh I would like to emphasize this question of sustainability as far as health is concerned Sometimes when we talk of sustainability we think in money terms you know We think that there should be you know the budget should be increased there should be more money and therefore we can have sustainable development But we don't think on the question of empowerment And this situation since we are talking of women and children we're talking of empowerment of women If women are given health education they can influence changes in the family For example as far as communicable diseases are concerned example to wash hands to wash your hands for example before eating the use of latrines to educate the youngsters on Aids and so on you know This is what I say I talk of sustainable in health because it will mean that we have less disease and this is part and parcel of the prevention that we are talking about you know Women's picture must be portrayed as reproducers as producers educators home makers and also home nurses They have many roles to play Women through the mass media I believe should not be seen to be retrogressive when it comes to highlighting health issues but should be bold enough you should be bold enough to report objectively on issues that have led to bad health of women and children for a long time There are many examples and here I would like to mention only a few For example what is the effect of the problem of refugees in Rwanda on women Sometimes people do not understand us you know I was a meeting when UHCR <O/> organized a meeting at Kilimanjaro hotel and we said that there are certain things which are bearing to the women When you talk of refugees for example you cannot talk of refugees in totality You have to address also women refugees What are their issues in as far as health is concerned So these are important issues that I believe that the journalists can take up you know and bring up forward in front Effect of aids on health of women We know that apart from women being infected with Aids but we also know that it is women for example who are concerned of taking care of Aids patients It is basic It is true It is women It is all the people all the women who take care of the Aids patients and this is an effect also on the health of the women in this area So let we should be able to look at the coins in these different ways The effect of Aids on women and the effect of those people who have Aids but still it is the women who have to take care of the Aids patients What effect it has on the women's health and the children that this woman has to take care of I know that as journalists you have covered a number of health issues and I would like to commend you on that you know You can read it in different papers Daily News Uhuru and others papers and it is very good that today we have many papers in Tanzania you know and I do hope that this challenge will continue that more and more will be reaching on health issues And I would like to say that as far as Ministry of Health is concerned you know we shall be ready and I will inform my people we shall be ready to remove all the unnecessary bureaucracies and there are certain documents for example you know which are transparent you know We are not saying that transparency means that everything you should have but there are certain documents actually you know you know sometimes they are made confidential they are not supposed to be confidential So some of the documents I would like to say that perhaps you know they should educate the people but sometimes we censor them you know We censor them unnecessarily and when we censor them  unnecessarily it will mean that the journalists and the writers will not be able to get access to information This information which they can use actually to help the government Health is interstructural so when you need I hope when you need information from other ministries because it relates to health then people will forget you know about unnecessary bureaucracy unnecessary red tape unnecessary fear also of the journalists When a journalist is outside your office we start saying I'm not here you know I have been informed that you're a team of selected journalists As a team after this workshop you should be able to work together so that through effective reporting you can help bring about the images of a new and healthy Tanzanian woman For example as media people you need to use your institution to fight against harmful cultural practices such as female circumcision You should be concerned for it is the power of concerned and committed people and their organizations that can bring what needs to be done within the bound of what can be done I would like to repeat that I said that you should be concerned We should be concerned Everybody should be concerned on health because health touches everybody since the time you are born and  till the time you die health touches you Therefore you should be concerned for it is the power of concerned and committed people and their organizations that can bring what needs to be done within the bound of what can be done And I know I'm convinced you can do this Through reporting you need to sensitize women and women groups and the society in general so that they can voice their opinion and make demands to the government and international community on the need to improve health services for women and children It is important that reporting and analysing be objective It does not help us if we just say that maternal mortality in Tanzania is high We need to say we need to go further than that and say what has the ministry done on this what's the positive aspects and the negative aspects What has non-governmental organization has done and international agencies done This is only fair And that is why I say that it should be objective And that is why I say that we will be ready to give information It will be unfair for example to write information we got five years ago or four years ago for that matter It should be information present and it should not be information just to sensitize people you know but this information is not correct So what I'm saying is that you know we shall be ready to offer information and I do that this information I do hope that this information will be used correctly for the people for the Tanzanian people as a whole\n<$B> Minister of

{'text': "<$A> Spotlight on Tanzania This is a weekly focus on development issues and strategies in Tanzania This week a look at the role of architects towards improved shelter for the rural and urban poor Stay tuned At the population growth rate of three point three per cent per annum Tanzania will have thirty-five million people by the year two thousand and the urban populations will have more than doubled thus compounding the housing problem This is what the Minister of State for Communications and Works Gandram Itatiro says He refers to the principal need for having serious efforts aimed at finding solutions for the pressing housing needs not only in Tanzania but generally in the whole African continent In fact <ea/>Ndugu Itatiro warns that if solutions were not found to the problem in the near future peace and stability and law and order would be at stake Tanzania for her part has been striving hard since independence to provide not only enough but decent shelter for every Tanzanian but this task as many others would not be accomplished overnight because it entails a number of things to be considered and a lot of human and material resources to be expended Housing is first of all an aspect of development and for any development to be achieved there must be well weighed and adhered to strategies Then according to the government short and long term development plans and strategies the centre of the plans has been and is still in fact the people themselves and how they can put resources into best use Suffice it to quote President Nyerere Development brings freedom provided it is a development of people but people cannot be developed they can only develop themselves For while it is possible for an outsider to build a man's house an outsider cannot give the man pride and self-confidence in himself as a human being Those things a man has to create in himself by his own actions He develops himself by what he does He develops himself by making his own decisions by increasing his understanding of what he's doing and why by increasing his own knowledge and ability and by his own full participation as an equal in the life of the community he lives in Thus for example a man is developing himself when he grows or earns enough to provide decent conditions for himself and his family He's not being developed if someone gives him these things A man is developing himself when he improves his education whatever he learns about He is not being developed if he simply carries out orders from someone better educated then himself without understanding why those orders have been given A man develops himself by joining in free discussion of a new venture and participating in the subsequent decision He's not being developed if he's herded like an animal into the new venture Development to a man can in fact only be effected by that man Development of the people can only be effected by the people End quotes \nWith that in mind then it's appropriate to point out that the Government of Tanzania is committed to make the best possible use of the country's manpower and economic resources with a view to accelerate social and economic development the provision of decent shelter not excluded It should be noted that the housing problem in rural areas where the majority of Tanzanians live in traditional houses is not very acute nor is it a serious threat to health but the government's efforts  are still to help the rural population build better houses by means of better materials which can be found locally The thrust upon urban housing is to enable lower income groups access to more decent housing and more so on self-help basis This is what the government has been doing especially since the second five-year development plan of nineteen sixty-nine up to nineteen seventy-four and thereafter in the succeeding plan It's already envisaged in the long term plan covering the period between the years nineteen eighty-one up to two thousand that the aim should be to consolidate the potential and ability to implement building works The government will continue rendering its support to the people in the form of advice materials loans and designing to enable them build better and permanent houses The government will also along with parastatals and private companies consolidate plans for building houses for their employees That is the long term strategy of the government towards solving the housing problem in Tanzania but our interest this week is mainly to see how Tanzanian architects contribute towards the task of housing the rural and urban poor We shall consider the role of Tanzanian architects in the context of the umbrella task of African architects on solving housing problems affecting the majority of the people in the continent Perhaps the very objectives of the Architectural Association of Tanzania AAT can serve as a starting point to illustrate not only the importance of architects in a given society like ours but also how such an association best tell us its objectives to suit the basic development needs of Tanzania and certainly Africa also Mbeda Muli is the chairman of the Architectural Association of Tanzania whose main objectives include \n<$B> to inform the general public on the existence of the professional association through press announcements etcetera Two to make official communications between the government and its board authorities like National Board of Registration of quantity surveyors <O/> quantity surveyors and building constructors and National Construction Council uh and to inform them of the valuable source of professional advice that is available to them through the association Thirdly to establish architectural brotherhood and relationship with other international architectural associations unions and internal related professional boards like Tanzanian Institution of Engineers and the profession centre \n<$A> Those are the principal objectives on which the Architectural Association of Tanzania justifies its existence but our consideration should also be on how organisations like those of architects help governments in a number of areas The Prime Minister <ea/>Ndugu Salem Mohammed Salem who underlines the importance of local architects says they can contribute immensely  to the formulation of the recovery policies of not only Tanzania but of other African governments as well mainly by ensuring that the building policies of various countries are formulated to suit concrete conditions However <ea/>Ndugu Salem emphasises that to make architects and what they advise the government sound more effective training must top among their priorities \n<$C> A training of professionals in the architectural field is a prerequisite condition to succeed in our objective towards an effective housing industry In many African states the number of registered architects is far below the national requirements In Tanzania for instance we have about one hundred and thirty registered architects We have to plan for the increasing demand for housing in both urban and rural areas A few numbers of registered architects manifest the need for a consolidated training programme Tanzania has no institution which trains professionals in architecture However the Dar es Salaam art institute offers semi-professional training programmes with a view to meeting the national requirements in the construction industry \n<$A> One reason which analysts concentrating on the housing situation in Tanzania and other African countries attribute to the not so excellent performance is that of inappropriate technology Minister Itatiro harbours the view that most African countries found themselves confronted with expensive and inappropriate architectural designs far beyond the reach of most people and economy in financial terms Thus the problem of housing the poor is compounded With a need for low cost housing which utilised initiative resources and creativity of the individuals and communities there is also the importance of provision of appropriate designs which took into consideration the cultural heritage and aspirations Tanzania therefore needs a break-through in appropriate architectural design and building materials in order to make low cost housing available to the majority of the people To quote the Prime Minister <ea/>Ndugu Salem All over the world professionalism in architecture has mainly been urban centred In Tanzania and Africa in general the relevance of this system has to be reconsidered in the context of the environment where the overwhelming majority of the people live in rural areas \n<$C> These people cannot afford to pay the services of an architect nor can they adopt the specifications and the implied technology The government of Tanzania is taking steps by undertaking programmes to provide land for housing development giving support to institutions dealing with research development and production of local building materials and is also in the process of reviewing the colonial building by-laws All these measures are aimed redressing the above situation The architectural heritage which is not necessarily expensive should form the basis of the architects' solutions to improve rural housing which not only with not only appreciable low cost but also with acceptable social orders relevant to the predominant African extended family model I therefore argue to study and understand various cultures and technologies in our continent when designing for rural settlements As I said earlier most of our people live in the rural areas Most of them have scarce financial resources Nevertheless they need good shelter Acceptably this problem should be solved by the respective governments and architects therefore have to share the responsibility They've also the obligation to assist their governments to develop the rural areas with design solutions which will take into consideration the limited financial resources available We're all aware that there are problems of both quality and quantity in shelter and housing in Africa Most of our urban areas are faced with acute shortage of housing both quantitatively and qualitatively The reasons behind this are quite obvious and to mention but the two main ones are the unregulated rural urban migration and general population growth Shortage of housing in the urban areas  has more often than not resulted in the increase of squatter settlements These unplanned settlements have increasingly posed a problem to our governments as it created administrative and financial constraints in trying to improve social amenities such as hospitals schools roads water electricity and sewage \n<$A> Independence  from unnecessary foreign influence in all activities of society is an important aim for Tanzania The construction policies of Tanzania stipulate in no uncertain terms that the aim should be to accelerate Tanzanianisation of the design construction and construction material sector Also to work for import substitution both in design construction and manufacture of construction materials inter alia by promoting domestic industries based on local raw materials hence increasing public participation in the design and construction sector Those are the national construction policies which also direct the activities of architects in Tanzania The policies are based on the fact that Tanzania is a poor country and there are enormous needs for development and improvement The problem for the government is to use the limited resources of the country to get maximum development impact The use of appropriate resources and appropriate technology for that matter in the architectural sector need not be emphasised The reasons are concisely clear \n<$C> As we know some of the structures we see in Africa today though they're impressive and appealing are very expensive to construct and certainly also to maintain Architects engineers quantity surveyers planners and developers should therefore concentrate on cost saving designs taking into consideration our environment and available building materials The expert of maintenance in the building industry plays a very significant role whereas maintenance of a structure is an expected reality it is a duty of architects and other involved teams of consultants to come up with design solution that will keep the maintenance cost to the minimum the minimumRRR May I also suggest that it should be their duty to draw up comprehensive maintenance schedules to enable developers keep realistic maintenance budgets Another aspect related to maintenance is linked with the necessity of involving local consultants at the earlier stages of designing where foreign consultancy is engaged Local consultants can play a positive role in helping the foreign consultants to come up with a sound design which is both cheap and easy to maintain It would therefore be most desirable that local consultants be fully involved in all foreign consultancy projects At this stage I would like to assure the members of the architectural community and the public at large that the government of Tanzania takes seriously the observations and recommendations that are forwarded by the associations through workshops seminars and conferences", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$X> We present Book Review \n<$A> Hello and a please welcome to another programme of book review This week we are reviewing a book titled Gender and Development in Tanzania Past Present and Future The book is compiled by Anna Nilea Inkia and Teresia Mruma It is published by the Women Research and Documentation Project Dar es Salaam and it's reviewed for us as usual by Edwin Semsaba\n<$B> This book is a collection of articles that deals with different aspects of life as related to gender in Tanzania The authors also give their recommendations as what should be done to arrest the situation There is a consensus among the writers that a gender imbalance exists and this has not been caused by biological traits but by men in various modes of production that the world has gone through It is the women who are the victims of this imbalance The articles are concerned though not all in a uniform manner with the reasons for the immemorial oppression of women in  the> class and pre-class societies alike The consequences of legislative affairs for the struggle for development in Tanzania and for what ends in the name of what values and ideals could society be inspired to fight against this <O/> inequality today B Koda and Anga Isa in their paper Gender and Relation Concepts state that there are diverse categories occupying the world and do exist in relationships which are sometimes not only contradictory but antagonistic Such relationships within social formations in which people live and of the production relations therein for example the political and economic arrangements specifying who controls which resources and appropriates whose labour output It has already been established that the division of people is based on property ownership and is best identified on the basis of class race gender and age They argue that it has already been established that the respective social imbalances are embedded in given ideologies such as patriarchy capitalism matriarchy apartheid colonialism and even socialism and religion They state that gender is the first category of operation and will probably be the last category of liberation Their assertion is based on the historical nature of all oppressive categories by institutions social systems and communities that include global capitalism all of which have relied on the support of women at different levels including the household In that case and as long as the exploitation of labour by capital continues and male dependency on female roles persists including the burden of biological and social  reproduction gender will be the last category of liberation They end their article discussing paradigms that do inform on gender relations The second part deals with research methods with application to gender in which <name/> deals with data collection analysis and interpretation Part Three deals with the social aspects of gender whereby four people have contributed <Name/> in her article Gender Bias in Language shows that there is gender bias in language She sees the implications of these women as serious and far-reaching The inculcation of stereotyped images of women through language and other social institutions begins with childhood and continues until death This has facilitated the absorption of thoughts and beliefs hostile to women to the extent that these are taken as truth by men and women Women themselves constantly use these images to describe other women and themselves This has greatly eroded  the self-esteem and confidence of women in general A woman who is constantly interrupted in speech may finally believe that she has nothing to offer and consequently becomes silenced A woman who is constantly reminded that she is a sexual object created for the pleasure of men may decide that the best way to succeed is to serve men's needs and interests She may therefore strive to behave in a manner acceptable to men Language thus serves as a powerful tool in both creating and maintaining the power relations present in society The author  says changing language alone to make it more positive towards women may be a difficult task if other areas of inequality remain intact but it is her belief that more gender eqality in social and economic spheres will result in a language that is less hostile to women and create an environment more suitable for equality and change <Name/> Omari Gendered Perceptions The Way We Learn About Them analyses some of the customs and traditions to see how they are being used in the socialisation process to impart and mould certain behaviours and the way of doing things in our society Omari observes that the way human beings learn things and then internalise them to develop some gender relations which become part of our lives leads to gender inequality in our society Among the inequalities he names the bias seen in resource allocation based on sex Women are denied to inherit properties at household level In most African societies women do not inherit land It is conceded that because women are going to be married hence transferred to another social unit it is not proper for them to take with them the land which is considered a family property irrespective of their very significant contribution to agriculture production Richard Mbala in his article Gender in Tanzania Fiction reveals that there is gender bias by writers but not done intentionally Mbala sees that research in this field it is still minimal and recommends more research to be done to avoid generalisation Gregory Baas sees music as very expressive in showing gender relations while Louis Buguni has outlined notes on the creative process in gender formative prejudices concepts and perceptions Part Four of the book deals with the economic and political aspects of gender in which Berta <?/Koda argues that there is limited women involvement in politics either as elected or appointed leaders In her article Women Participation in Politics and Public Life in Tanzania she sees the strategy adopted by women of opting work for political change out of the formal male dominated system is not to be taken as alternative but rather as a complementary system She suggests that women's decision making power and control at all levels is essential in the fight for gender equality Women are advised by Rose Shyo in her article Gender and Economics Analysing the Changing Roles of Women Participation in Economic Development to abandon the piecemeal economic project approach which they found themselves in and adopt a long term co-ordinated perspective to planning She recommends that in this time of <ea/>madiosi women should use the power of their words to bargain for more resources equal opportunities credit facilities and all other necessary <O/> measures now lacking Part Five of the book deals with legal aspects of gender and <name/> in Physical Violence Against Women and the Law in Mainland Tanzania suggests that both legal and extra-legal interventions should operate side by side This is to make effective the bill of rights in the constitution which  lacks clear government policy for law reforms <Name/> in his article Political Rights of Women in Tanzania at Catch Twenty-Two says the challenge facing everyone engaged in the endeavour to procure equal rights for and the exercise thereof by women is to concede and declare publicly the factors likely to limit the success of that endeavour A D Kwara in Gender Context in Tanzania's Health Policy addresses itself to the issues of gender in Tanzania's health system It deals also with  the> cost sharing in the context of structural adjustment and its impact on women's health It explores women's situation in society and its implications in the formulation of gender sensitive health policy Among the recommendations Kwara puts forward is that if women are to be given their rightful position in the health policy of the country they must mobilise themselves for it Anna Nilea Inkia in her article The Mass Media: Gender and Development in Tanzania says the mass media plays little role in correcting the awareness concept the female gender is inferior She recommends that the editors and writers of fiction stories designers of advertisements jazz bands and all others  whose work is disseminated to the public through mass media have to be sensitized  to the implication  of their works of art for society's values and attitudes There is also Part Eight that deals with agricultural and technological aspects of gender Part Nine deals with gender aspects of HIV AIDS where Justin Guma discusses the essential decision making in the context of AIDS and sees the need for women in parliament Ellen Boma sees HIV AIDS as an economic and social challenge to women in Tanzania Boma observes that the effect of HIV infection and AIDS on women are more than medical issues They include the fact that women are placed at higher risk of contracting the disease through their social and reproductive roles gender inequality and  no empowerment to make decisions on their own sexuality and health AIDS stigmatization is generally higher for women than it is for men For example it is generally assumed that a man who dies from HIV AIDS is not ashamed because he died while on duty <O/> There are no similar statements directed to women In spite of having a higher risk of contracting AIDS most women have limited access to health information that could help them make right decisions about their health A future without gender barriers could not efface the struggle and surely the publication of this book Gender and Development in Tanzania past Present and Future is part of Women Research and Documentation Projects' effort to shift the terrain of struggle negotiation and often compromise from the private realm to the public sphere In this sense the book is addressed in some embarrassment to women as much as to men \n<$A> You

{'text': "We present African Development Hello listeners welcome once again to another quarter hour programme of African Development This is a weekly programme in which we highlight the economic activities taking place in one of African countries or any regional or sub-regional groupings in the continent of Africa Emphasis will be based on the economic sector but cultural and political sectors will also be included This week we will look at the economy of the Republic of Seychelles The Republic of Seychelles comprises a scattered archipelago of granitic and coralline islands ranging over some one million square kilometres of the western Indian Ocean The exact number of islands is not known but has been estimated at one hundred and fifteen of which forty-one are granitic and the remainder coralline The group also includes numerous rocks and small caves When independence was achieved in June nineteen seventy-six the Aldabra Islands the Farquhar group and the Desrouches part of the British Indian Ocean territory since nineteen sixty-five were reunited with Seychelles restoring the land area to three hundred and eight square kilometres Including the Aldabra lagoon the country's area is four hundred and fifty-four square kilometres The islands take their name from the Viscount Morrin d'Seychelles controller-general of France in the reign of Louis of France The largest of the group is Mahé which was named after former French governor of Mauritius It has an area of about one hundred and forty-eight square kilometres and is approximately twenty-seven kilometres long from north to south Mahé lies one thousand eight hundred kilometres east of Mombasa three thousand three hundred kilometres south-west of Bombay and one thousand one hundred kilometres north of Madagascar Victoria the capital of Seychelles and only port of the archipelago is on Mahé It is the only town in Seychelles of any size The islanders have a variety of ethnic origins These include African European Indian and Chinese The total population of Seychelles was estimated to be sixty-six thousand two hundred and twenty-nine at mid nineteen eighty-seven The Seychelles archipelago may have been known and visited in the Middle Ages by Arab traders who were sailing to and from ports in East Africa The Amirante group was sighted by Vasco da Gama in fifteen oh two and a first fully documented visit to the archipelago was made by a British East India Company expedition in sixteen oh nine The French first explored the islands in seventeen forty-one claiming possession of them in seventeen fifty-six although leaving them uninhabited until seventeen-seventy when settlers arrived to exploit the islands' abundant resources of tortoise and timber and slavery was introduced In seventeen ninety-four the French garrison surrendered to a British naval force although token French administration continued until eighteen ten The Treaty of Paris of eighteen fourteen finally confirmed the British possession of the Seychelles and Mauritius The two colonies were administered as a single unit until eighteen seventy-two and it was not until nineteen oh three that their full separation was completed and Seychelles became a crown colony At the London constitutional conference in March nineteen seventy there was full agreement on a plan to establish a ministerial system in the Seychelles but the British government rejected the plan for integration with United Kingdom on the precedent of the Isles of Man which was put forward by the leader of the main Seychelles political party the Seychelles Democratic Party SDP Mr James Mankam Despite protests from Mr Mankam who became chief minister in November nineteen seventy the Organisation of African Unity OAU passed numerous resolutions supporting the socialist oriented Seychelles Peoples United Party SPUP which was led by Mr Albert René in its stand for complete independence from Britain In March nineteen seventy-five the leaders of the two parties participated in a constitutional conference in London and announced their intention of forming a coalition government as a prelude to independence by June nineteen seventy-six Internal self-government and an interim constitution followed in October after the British government had appointed a commission to investigate the electoral system which SPUP claimed to be unfair Mr Mankam became prime minister in the cabinet in which four of the twelve members were from the SPUP and the legislative assembly was increased from fifteen to twenty-five members by the inclusion of an additional five members who where nominated by each party The constitutional conference resumed in London in January nineteen seventy-nine and resulted in agreement on the principles of an independent constitution which came into effect on twenty-ninth June nineteen seventy-six The legislative assembly was redesignated the national assembly Mr James Mankam became president of the new republic and Mr Albert René prime minister In nineteen seventy-seven Mr Mankam was deposed and Mr René took over as president The area of cultivable land in Seychelles is very limited about one thousand hectares of a total of fourteen thousand hectares on Mahé and the soil is largely is generally poor New land was being opened for the farming on some of the outlying islands which are managed by the islands' development company which is a parastatal body which was established in nineteen-eighty It is now responsible for land on ten islands Seychelles is heavily dependent on imported food which together with drink and tobacco accounts for about eighteen per cent of the total import bill but this proportion was being slowly reduced The government was trying to make the country more self-sufficient in vegetables fruit meat and milk There are a large number of farms four of them owned by the state owned Seychelles Agricultural Development Company SADeC about six hundred and fifty small farms and thousands of small holdings about one half of them were being run by part-time farmers In its attempt to raise food production the government was setting up more state farms and expanding the <name/> farmers trading centre The main exports have traditionally been coconuts especially for copra frozen fish and the cinnamon which was exported as bulk but in nineteen eighty-seven the first year of its production canned <O/> fish became the most significant Minor exports crops included peach oil vanilla tea and limes Since the start of nineteen eighty-three the government has allowed the export of only <O/> copra whose world market price was double that for other grades which were being processed locally into oil and the by-product made into animal food Tea is grown for domestic consumption and there is a surplus for export The government was trying to increase output of bananas mangoes and uh avocados Seychelles is now self-sufficient in eggs and poultry and there has been a large increase in the number of pigs although animal feed had to be imported The nineteen eighty-five eighty-nine national development plan included projects for starting a bread fruit plantation for pig feed commercial potato-growing a coconut rehabilitation scheme on Mahé and the construction of a coconut desiccation plant The islands' first fruit and vegetable canning plant and an integrated pottery unit started operating in nineteen eighty-two These projects were planned and set up by the parastatal national <name/> industries which have since been incorporated into the Seychelles marketing body A dairy plant was opened at <name/> in nineteen eighty-six Seychelles' economy is heavily dependent on tourism which provides more than seventy per cent of total foreign exchange earnings almost fifty per cent of gross domestic product fifteen per cent of formal employment and a very high proportion of secondary employment In nineteen eighty-three the sector provided more than one third of government revenue It was estimated that over sixty per cent of the gross earnings from tourism leaves the country to pay for imported food and other goods and the tour operators The tourism industry really started after the opening of Mahé international airport in nineteen seventy-one In that year there were only three thousand one hundred and seventy-five visitors but the number rose to a record of seventy-eight thousand nine hundred by nineteen seventy-nine On minerals the government of Seychelles in nineteen seventy-seven signed a petroleum exploration agreement which covered an offshore concession area of sixteen thousand square kilometres with a consortium including AMOK of the United States of America which later bought out its partners In nineteen eighty-two AMOK officials signed a new agreement covering five more off-shore wells in addition to those which were already drilled Other concessions were held by Elf Aquitaine of France and Santa Fé Industries of the United States of America An exploration promotion programme was launched by the government in nineteen eighty-five In nineteen eighty-seven the government signed an agreement  with Enterprise Oil Exploration a British company Under the agreement the company gained exclusive rights to explore an offshore area south-east of Mahé and to develop any viable fields The Commonwealth Fund for Technical Co-operation had assisted Seychelles in the organisation of seminars to attract the interest of international oil companies and in negotiations with companies and the drafting of contracts Seychelles' gross domestic product in real terms by about sixteen per year between nineteen seventy and nineteen seventy-four and the growth remained at a high level until nineteen eighty This high growth rate was due to the rapid expansion of tourism and of public sector spending The level gross domestic product per head at three thousand two hundred US dollars in nineteen eighty-six was one of the highest in Africa and it placed the Seychelles among the upper middle income countries according to United Nations definitions \nWell with that item

{'text': "<$A> We present Women's Half Hour Welcome once again to another edition of Women's Half Hour Today we look at the East African post-Dakar Symposium held in Dar es Salaam recently Stay tuned\n<$A> The East African post-Dakar Symposium which was held in June in Dar es Salaam involved about forty participants from non-governmental organisations NGOs from Tanzania Kenya and Uganda A similar symposium was held in Entebbe Uganda  at the end of March this year The main objective of the symposium was to discuss issues of common interest and more particular on democracy and good governance The symposium was opened by the Minister for Community Development Women Affairs and Children Honourable Anna Makinda Earlier welcoming the Minister TANGO chairperson Mrs Christine Insekela had some few points to raise concerning the symposium and the Beijing conference in general \n<$B> As you might be aware Honourable Minister a lot has taken place since Arusha National Conference in August nineteen ninety-four  at which we had  the privilege of having you as our guest of honour too and the African Preparatory Conference in November nineteen ninety-four which was held in Dakar A number of participants here attended the East African post-Dakar Symposium that was organised by Uganda and held at Entebbe in March nineteen ninety-five At national level the preparations were going on with holding of the post-Dakar National Symposium at <name/> hotel in Kibaha in the Coast Region this year During this time the completion of registration for participation in Beijing was finalised Some members also had the advantage of attending other preparatory workshops seminars and conferences Honourable Minister briefly the purpose of this symposium is to reflect on the East African post-Dakar Symposium In that symposium the NGOs from East Africa shared the national preparatory process and also their varied experiences of the Dakar preparatory conference The other task of the Entebbe symposium was to chart out ways of working together as the East African sub-region The outcome of this symposium is the proposed one-day East African workshop in Beijing China We hope that will take place As most of the participants who attended the Entebbe symposium will recall it was agreed that the theme of the East African workshop is economic empowerment women and democratisation process These form the major areas of concern on the African Platform for Action From the programme I note that at this symposium more workshops on the theme will be conducted I hope the experience and further suggestions from the participants will enrich the workshops ready for Beijing \n<$A> Mrs Insekela now talks a little about East African NGOs' co-operation \n<$B> I believe that the initial process has been set I call on more commitment so that this momentum is not lost with the Beijing uh conference It is anticipated that after Beijing a number of initiatives will evolve to co-operate and share experiences in the implementation of the three themes of the Global Platform for Action namely equality development and peace The space and setting that has been created by the World Conference should not be allowed to waste away Honourable Minister We appreciate the co-operation that exists between your ministry and TANGO This is evidenced by the commitment of the government to sponsor three participants and also to reserve ten places in the government delegation for NGOs at the Beijing conference We hope this goodwill will continue\n<$A> The Minister for Community Development Women Affairs and Children Honourable Makinda who officially opened the symposium commended the East African women for having resolved to plan and share activities of implementation of the critical areas of concern for Africa Then she continues \n<$C> Although the sub-regions planned their work throughout their areas of concern and although we are all aware of the fact that the liberation of women is far from being achieved globally we women in this sub-region of Africa must join forces and confront our concerns faster than has ever been the case before You rightly noted that there is need to work on culture family and socialisation The new <O/> that can bring change to some of the cultural issues that lie at the base of  women's issues and concerns equality legal rights economic empowerment and participation in the peace process for the sub-region are also areas you have proposed at prior time I must commend you highly for coming up with this package How can you talk of equality without legal rights economic empowerment Who among this gathering is not aware of the effects of war and the necessity of peace These are all very important issues as far as our liberation is concerned We have to give them a lot of thought and practical solutions Madam chairperson at this juncture let me share with you some of my views on your main theme for discussion during these three days I'm told that you are going to deliberate on  women's participation in democratisation good governance and the electoral system in East Africa and you will also have time to look at poverty reduction and economic empowerment for women I'm asking you because there's talk of poverty reduction not alleviation Kenya and Uganda have had a taste of multi-party elections Tanzania is in the process of entering into multi-party elections We all believe that all these elections are democratic but sufficient suffice it to say that democracy is a system of values and ethical principles or a system of rules and behaviour patterns that define and shape interpersonal relations These systems of values <O/> principles and system of rules and behaviour regulation political economic and social behaviour of a given society Even if our governments become democratic through multi-partyism election how do we as women share the democratic process and decision making without participation How can women ensure democracy and good governance as the order of the day Do women know and understand their role How much have we as women NGOs concerned ourselves with educating our fellow women on the whole process of voting and elections Does educating the electorate end with voting What lessons can our sisters in Uganda and Kenya offer us in Tanzania and more important what can East Africa offer to the rest of the world If we want to be an example deliberate efforts must be deployed to raise the awareness of all women in the process of elections assuming responsibilities and demanding their rights and let us prove that the hand that rocks the  cradle moves the world Women must ensure that they have control over the people who take office to institute democracy and good governance The time to do so is now and not later particularly you in Tanzania There is no time to complain  about oppression discrimination at places of work complaining  about the effects of war if we do not give the issue of democracy elections and good governance deeper and constructive implementation It is my sincere hope that you will continue to exchange stimulating and enriching ideas to further <O/> your alliance of operations on these issues to enhance the participation of women in the in the democratisation process and good governance Above all women should learn to love one another and be united for the common cause Most of the time women themselves are the number one enemy of one of women's liberation There are many examples to this effect Women are the majority in all these countries How come we cannot elect the few women who stand to be elected Educating women voters is one thing but deliberately voting for our women candidates is another This is where women defeat ourselves Men know about this We have the we have to mentally liberate ourselves and love one another more than what is happening now \n<$A> Turning to the issue of poverty reduction and economic empowerment Honourable Makinda had this to say \n<$C> I purposely wanted to use the poverty reduction because in the summit on social summit they we hardly agreed on definition If we call ourselves alleviating we shall be meandering around not knowing what we are trying to alleviate but we must reduce it with  the> time we have to reduce poverty among women It has been said that *prosperate> societies find it difficult to to really bring change because prosperity is a great promoter of selfishness The concept of sharing is not willingly embraced by prosperous societies The globalisation of world politics means that the richer are getting richer and the poorer are forced to survive on the even shrinking resources It is also said that poverty is generally not an isolated problem nor is it caused by the poor On the contrary it is rooted within the system If this is so and I do believe it is then the question's how can women NGOs penetrate their government's structures to bring to notice that changes should be effected for the betterment of women's economic ability in the sub-region Madam chairperson the subject of poverty reduction is very wide and within this short settlement one cannot be able to cover it extensively Here in our country we are developing a package on poverty reduction not necessarily for women alone because if we think that we should just concentrate on women while she's serving a family of a big family including the relatives then you find that we are not even helping this woman we are just oppressing her So poverty reduction should be an issue of the family an issue of the society Of course if we achieve then the women are the ones who are going to benefit most Therefore as I said before I don't like to pre-empt you on what is happening here but it is a target that we have to fight poverty With the poverty we have learned that women are not going to school When there are five children and two of them are women and are girls and two of them are boys the boys will go to school the girls will not Women now are dying even more because they cannot pay for their for health facilities They are dying even more because they have to work very hard to get nothing So we feel that unless we solve the issue of poverty maybe most of the themes we are stressing may be very difficult to implement When women continue to be marginalised and when women are forced to struggle for basic needs in order to survive at times through commercialising their bodies one has to be honest will these women find time to participate in the whole process of democratisation Is multi-partyism and democratic process coupled with the structure adjustment programmes and IDF conditions sufficient or do we as women need to look further and form women's perspectives and give our viewstand and take part in the whole process I know I've asked more questions than given views but I believe in trying to raise these questions and share our opinions and strategies this meeting will come up with the <O/> that can lead to viable solutions Let us not only look forward to going to Beijing let us go there with a method for poverty reduction and economic empowerment of women And in some government meetings we have a tendency of defending our status as countries I hope the NGOs will not fall in that problem We have to be open and be united as East African You're here because we have so many things in common with all of us so let us not defend any system which is not operating efficiently Let us talk and put our themes open \n<$A> After the symposium was officially opened each country presented a brief report about the process of the preparations for the Beijing conference TANGO <O/> chairperson Shilban Kasim analyses the activities taken in Tanzania \n<$D> Since the last donors' conference by TANGO in November nineteen ninety-four the following activities have taken place I believe I don't have to dwell too much on the organisation and facilitation for Dakar We had a number of pre-Dakar uh seminars One was held in collaboration with the government and the other was held by the uh NGO TANGO We were able to send thirty-seven NGO delegates to Dakar and some of us participated as government delegates  at that meeting", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '75cc9681-6bcc-4392-b7fc-4ba056269b14', 'added':

{'text': "<$A> Hello listeners Welcome again to our weekly quarter-hour-programme of African development In this programme we feature economic activities taking place in African countries or any regional or sub-regional groupings in the continent to Africa Emphasis will be based in the economic sector but culture and political sectors will also be included This week we shall have a look at the economy of Zambia\n<$B> Zambia formerly the British colonial territory of Northern Rhodesia gained its independence on the twenty-fourth of October nineteen sixty-four It has a population of six point eight million occupying an elevated plateau country in south-central Africa It has an area of seven hundred and fifty-two thousand six hundred and fourteen square kilometres Zambia is a land-locked state and shares a boundary with no fewer than eight other countries It is surrounded by Angola Zaire Tanzania Malawi Mozambique Zimbabwe Botswana and Namibia Seventy per cent of its population lives in the rural areas Zambia has more than seventy tribes the major ones being Bemba Nyanja Tonga Lozi Lunda and Livale The capital of the country is Lusaka\n<$A> The landscape of Zambia is dominated by the even skylines of uplifted plantation surfaces About four fifths of the country is covered by Savannah woodland of semi-evergreen trees Highest elevations are reached on the Nika Plateau on the Malawi border with a height of two thousand one hundred and sixty-four metres where uplift associated with the East-African Rift system is at maximum Elevation declines westward where the country extends into the vast Kalahari Basin This  lies in an ancient arm of the East-African rift system but the rifting which formed Lake Tanganyika and Lake Mweru through on the country's northern border is of more recent age\n<$B> The recent history of Zambia shows that it came into existence on the twenty-fourth of October nineteen sixty-four when independence was granted by the British was granted to the British Protectorate of Northern Rhodesia This had been administered by the Colonial Office since nineteen twenty-four Before that the territory had been administered for a quarter of a century by the British South Africa Company The main impetus of British intrusion north of the Zambesi came from Cecil Rhodes a South African millionaire Rhodes wanted to see the High Plateau of Central and Eastern Africa under British rule settlement He also wanted to earn next to his personal mining empire the copper deposits of Katanga and gold deposits between Limpopo and Zambesi The British government concerned as it was with maintaining British supremacy at the Cape was anxious to prevent the Boers Portuguese or Germans from creating hostile alliances further north Thus in eighteen eighty-nine it granted a charter to Rhodes' newly formed British South Africa Company giving it powers to make treaties and conduct administration north of the Limpopo In eighteen eighty-nine the British South Africa Company occupied the eastern part of what became Southern Rhodesia south of the Zambesi and meanwhile it had obtained treaties and concessions from various African chiefs north of the Zambesi Rhodes' agents were unsuccessful in Katanga which fell instead to King Leopold the Second of Belgium but the agreements elsewhere saved most of what became Northern Rhodesia now known as Zambia The first president on achieving independence was Dr Kenneth Kaunda leader of the UNIP party\n<$A> For the first six years after independence in October nineteen sixty-four the Zambian economy was one of the richest and fastest growing of Sub-Saharan Africa Gross domestic product in nineteen sixty-five prices increased by an estimated thirteen per cent per annum from nineteen sixty-four to nineteen sixty-nine the result of annual expansion in real output of five point five per cent to six per cent and an improvement in the terms of trade due to higher copper prices of seven per cent annually for the next five years From nineteen seventy the picture was more mixed with wide fluctuations in national income at constant prices which rose moderately until mid nineteen seventies and than fell more sharply By nineteen eighty-two the capital output gross domestic product was estimated at about US dollars six hundred in real terms some twenty-three per cent below the level of ten years earlier From nineteen seventy-four to nineteen eighty real gross domestic product was halved From nineteen seventy-five to nineteen eighty estimated private consumption per head declined in real terms by one third expenditure on government services per head by nearly one quarter and the government capital government expenditure per head by nearly two thirds The result by nineteen eighty was an economy in disarray with severe shortage of foreign exchange periodic shortages of basic goods including foodstuffs\n<$B> The decline of the economy of Zambia was a result of recession on the price and demand of copper in the world Zambia has had only limited success in expanding a programme on agriculture and industrial output in order to diversify the economy In nineteen seventy-five the president of Zambia called for a major change of strategy including a programme of rural reconstruction As a result the rural sector's performance in nineteen seventy-six and nineteen seventy-seven was relatively good with the production of maize which is Zambia's staple food reaching record levels Also in the harvest of nineteen eighty nineteen eighty-one there was a bumper season for maize and other crops such as millet and sorghum\n<$A> The industrial sector production since nineteen seventy-four has remained in dismay state Prices for copper and cobalt in nineteen eighty-two were fifty per cent lower than ten years earlier But in the first quarter of nineteen eighty-three they showed sharp upward trend If higher prices were maintained and if Zambia was able to *re-shed> its foreign debts the country would have been able to start pulling out of its dire financial crisis by nineteen eighty-three provided that the government's austerity measures introduced at the of start nineteen eighty-three were continued\n<$B> Metal mining is the country's most important economic activity providing about ninety-five per cent of foreign exchange earnings and sixteen per cent to eighteen per cent of gross domestic product Owing to the continuing predominance of the copper industry and grossly inadequate level of rural development the Zambian economy has an extremely dualistic structure characterised by large disparity of income and living standards between mining and other workers between high level personnel including expatriates and most other Zambians and between persons on the line of rail and those scattered in other parts of the country Agriculture accounted for only about eleven per cent of the gross domestic product in nineteen eighty-two of which subsistence output contributed about two thirds and the commercial sector about one third of which about one half came from European-owned farms The share of manufacturing output has greatly increased from under six per cent in nineteen sixty-four to eleven per cent of gross domestic product in nineteen eighty-two\n<$A> Zambian agriculture is split into three sectors Production by a few hundred large commercial farmers mainly expatriates who in nineteen seventy-nine produced about half of the total marketed agricultural output a growing number of small scale Zambian farmers and a mass of traditional farmers who are scattered throughout the country producing at low levels of productivity and selling little to the market Crops grown in Zambia are maize wheat and tobacco Other crops are cotton soya beans sunflower sugarcane and rice They also keep cattle They import food to supplement local production but there is a large-scale production of wheat and expansion of sugarcane plantations The chief cash crops are maize groundnuts and tobacco Zambia's economy is totally  dependent on the mineral sector as it contributes ninety per cent of its foreign exchange earnings\n<$B> Zambia gained independence in October nineteen sixty-five from the United Kingdom Later it became a republic and a party state with Dr Kenneth Kaunda as its first president Despite his long defence of the one party system in the end he agreed to political pluralism Mr Frederick Chiluba took over from Dr Kenneth Kaunda who was one of the most influential leaders in this continent of Africa \n<$A> President Frederick Chiluba was born in Kitwe on the thirtieth of April nineteen forty-three He completed his upper primary school in nineteen fifty-eight at Johnson Falls in Luapula province before entering junior secondary school at <name/> in the same province He started trade union career in nineteen sixty-seven His most influential position in trade unionism was that of President of the Zambia Congress of Trade Unions He held that position to the day he was elected President of the Republic of Zambia \n<$B> On the international scenario Zambia is a member of the Commonwealth the United Nations and the non-aligned movement It is also a member of the Organisation of African Unity OAU PTA SADC and the Frontline States\n<$A> Dear listeners we have come to the end of this week's programme of African Development In summary we have looked at the economic activities in the Republic of Zambia Join us next week for another programme of African development",

{'text': "<$A> We present Women's Half Hour Welcome once again to another edition of Women's Half Hour Today we bring you a discussion derived from the paper presented by Dr <name/> of the University of Dar es Salaam on the preponderance of women victims in Sukoma witch killings at a two-day national seminar on achievements in constraints of women in the past twenty years held in Dar es Salaam recently The seminar was organized by the Institute of Development Studies  Women's Study Group of the University of Dar es Salaam Witchcraft according to Dr Mesack is the socially constructed reality which baffles many states ruining lives in Africa It is known to be a critical factor in state societal <O/> in many African countries with consequential antagonisms between the individuals groups and law It presents paradoxes and dilemmas It has been established that witchcraft blocks progress Law which believes in practices may in turn be generated by certain types of development Bearing in mind the widespread nature of witchcraft in Tanzania Dr Mesack in his paper proposed to look at witch killings specifically in the Sukoma area where murder of old women are taking place But why women\n<$B> It has been customary to generalize that victims of the witch killings are mostly the stereotypical and eye red-eyed old women From my researches I have come to realize that it is not easy to provide any single circumspect explanation of this attitude It is not only because of the age of women which is said to be as old as <O_> <O/> and has been very prevalent in many different kinds of social systems including as I have pointed out medieval Europe In the Sukoma however there are no high level vested interests involved as was the case in Europe in witch craze That is witch killings are not sanctioned by the powers that be It's a local phenomenon Sukoma witches as elsewhere have certain attributes They are said typical to be old eccentric and given to unsocial  behaviour scolding cursing irritability and the like They are thought to be especially charactered by their red eyes \n<$A> One point perhaps worth mentioning is the fact that many Sukoma women have red eyes because of continuous use of cow dung as fuel of cooking and it is conceivable that this may contribute if only imaginary to their particular victimization in this context \n<$B> It should be borne in mind that not all women victims are red-eyed There are cases of women being killed on account of their success in business in life in general witchcraft being used only as a camouflage to conceal the real reasons A more powerful effect in the Sukoma case may be the structural imbalance between men and women in the social system with accusations being some sort of expression of the subordinated status of women Sukoma's socialisation stresses the fact that women are inherently prone to witchcraft and this has been authenticated by other researchers as well and also by I mean I have recent tests from one of my researchers who just come from the field If need be I can read that out In fact my idea might be to suggest that all Sukoma women are likely to be the most susceptible targets weak and <O/> as they are for those who look for human scapegoats to explain the  shortcomings of society This was prominently established with the rise of the <name/> groups known in Sukoma and <name/> areas by the name of <name/> This movement sought to eliminate some forms of insecurity and injustice consequently brought havoc for older women who saw the movement as a resurgence of traditional male aggression and oppression <Name/> members being Sukoma themselves hated old women who are vulnerable to perceptions of ill omen Sukoma I mean in Sukoma communities However it is very difficult without detailed case material to confirm the mere assertion of the above theories \n<$A> However Dr Mesack states some of the reasons that has made him to establish the witch killings in Sukoma land \n<$B> I have established that witch killings in Sukoma epitomise the cultural clash between idealised modernisation goals of the state and cosmology of the Sukoma people and the <name/> people and in Sukoma the political and economic change including the abolition of traditional rule Villagization and the development of commodity production has unleashed the number of contending forces Crime homicides and especially killing of suspected witches can thus be viewed as an expression of this contest in an area where old cultural forms are still powerful The witch killings in Sukoma pose a threat to peace and security of course which are indispensable for social and economic development of our country I relate to the particular significance of the preponderance of women as victims in this phenomena This misogyny is unacceptable in the nineteen nineties and above all an anathema to the ideology of <ea/>ujamaa in Tanzania and the peace and tranquillity we have been enjoying all this long At the root of this dilemma of course is a question of belief It is illusory to think that beliefs and norms of people can be transformed while the basic social situation within which they act and react they remain unchanged As such it can be hypothesised that witchcraft will continue to be a threat because the fact that witchcraft is flourishing remain The state authorities shown evidence of the ability to control these factors\n<$A> After Dr Mesack's presentation the participants had a chance to present their views Professor Daudens Impangala <name/> Director University of Dar es Salaam emphasized the need to make more researches on witchcraft because people say their beliefs are primitive they don't exist and so talking about them or doing research on them is wasting time \n<$C> So this attitude has developed in our society to the extent that it has also  influenced state organs The law is not very clear on this issue you see uh Actually I helped to realize a revival of a big revival of interest on the research of witchcraft in Europe I was surprised There is a lot of research which has been done on Nigeria and Cameroon particularly West Africa and in fact in Nigeria and Cameroon uh the law is very clear on issues of witchcraft and how to deal with witchcraft but in our case here it is something which has to be secret It is to be secret because for this church to show that it is it believes that these beliefs or witchcraft activities are there No it is uh something bad So what I would like to say is that I think it is time because something which exists It's a belief which exists and which affects people such as such big numbers of killings You can't just brush it away as something primitive It doesn't need our attention I think the initiative of Dr Mesack to do research on witchcraft should be widened so that we address this issue also from the academic and intellectual point of view \n<$A> Avemaria <name/> agrees with the reasons Dr Mesack gave on the paper on why women are murdered but she still had other points to add \n<$D> But I think there is something which is missing because few days ago we heard over the media that one woman was caught uh somewhere in okonga or whatever naked very early in the morning I don't know they said that she was doing some witches around the house of somebody and again few months ago we heard that a woman in Dodoma I think was again arrested because she had limbs of a human being That one again was through the media but when she was asked she said that the woman went for abortion and unfortunately she died so she was trying to you know to conceal that body but you know despite the fact that there are some cases of victimization but there are doubts sometimes as to the you know to this accusation because like the case in uh okonga I don't know maybe we need now to take action and see how that woman was blamed for or for just bewitching somebody's house And uh secondly in Sukoma what I came to discover again maybe it will be just an addition because when I was doing the research on environment we were faced again with the same problem but the explanation which we are given is that that system of uh you know young couples to stay with their parents-in-laws the family of their husband contributes a lot to this uh accusation when the mother-in-law now gets old because most of the mothers-in-laws treat badly their daughters-in-laws when they come to their houses They overwork them They accuse them They do whatever they wish to them so when they are liberated now they go and start their own household somewhere and then the mother-in-law gets old and uh she has to go and stay with that uh family again That daughter-in-law in most cases is not happy to see that the very mother-in-law who was uh uh victimizing her now comes and stays there with their families and usually they just go and whisper to the <ea/>zunguzungus and the <ea/>zunguzungu will come and act They give an ultimatum if she doesn't move they just kill her \n<$A> Then Dr Mesack clarified on <name/> naked cases He said it is difficult to say on that because the law is not clear \n<$B> Our witchcraft treatise is very It's very ambiguous It's not explicit as if you go and read the Ugandan witchcraft act of nineteen seventy-six which just states categorically that witchcraft does not include bona fide <ea/><O/> <O/> and stuff whereas in our case uh it's very ambiguous In fact it talks about sorcery and enchantment even in the case of you know limbs being found you know with this other person So it need a lots of reforming and also to be explicit It's not easy to prove a witchcraft case and that's why for example that out you pointed out the case that most of these Sukoma and <name/> women would be living with their grandchildren and they are living with them so that they can help you know in case of need and trouble and if for example they come the killers come and kill this old woman the evidence of the child who was in the house is not taken as evidence in law It's not allowed in law because he is an under-age person who cannot satisfy Therefore again you know the law is not I mean it's against you know the procedure I think the prosecution procedure at court \n<$A> Fortunately some of the participants who attended the seminar were coming from Shinyanga and Mwanza regions One of them was Helen <name/> She expresses her feelings concerning the murder of old women \n<$E> I'd been uh A relative of mine who was killed as a witch and actually she's a younger sister to my grandmother so in Sukoma I just call her grandmother and so this woman was killed and actually I am also a medical uh person and I'm quite interested because it really frustrates me and I'm glad that in his paper Dr <name/> mentioned the possibility of a correlation or linkage between what is happening and the epidemics like measles cholera and dysentery because just a few days ago I was talking to another old woman from my village She had come visiting and I was asking her about the status at home She was saying that people are dying a lot of children because of bloody diarrhoea but we are just waiting our time to be killed because whenever a child dies there must be found a witch but actually this old woman is so brave she knows even some linkage So I was thinking maybe in our future plans we could see whether the increase in killings uh witch killings is somehow correlated to disease epidemics to just to confirm probably some of the hunches we already have so that even if we are strategising then we know actually even how to teach people to educate people in this particular aspect because I actually I have a hunch that there is an increase in witch killings during a disease epidemic especially dysentery and measles so and Dr <name/> touched on this particular issue here and I also wanted to point out on the villagization Actually it is really a frustration to the Sukoma community to have been moved and live in those villages because actually the population increased and there are lots of mixing and losing uh of the values which they had", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> Radio Tanzania presents Book Review This week we will be reviewing a book entitled The Gift of Life by Patricia Kage Our reviewer is Edwin Semsaba\n<$B> This is a love story concerning a woman Tembi Gumbi and it takes place in South Africa It was early in the morning when in attempting to cross a traffic <O/> through Johannesburg Street Tembi was nearly knocked down by a car driven by one young man Traffic came to a halt as the young man got out of the car to give a word or two to Tembi Irrespective of the atmosphere prevailing at the material time both noted that the other's presence was captivating The young man returned to his car and drove off while Tembi entered a streetside cafe and ordered a drink to enable her to return to her senses after surviving what would have been a nasty accident Two weeks later Tembi's mother gave a twenty-fourth birthday party for her daughter Her father <name/> Gumbi who after years of poverty and toil in Soweto was now a well-to-do man who could afford lavish life and a birthday party to match Tembi was a senior secretary to one of the editors of the large daily Johannesburg newspapers When the party was on she heard  her father calling her name from behind She was smiling as she turned around but abruptly the smile faded from what her eyes encountered The author writes why her smile faded in the following ways \nThe smile faded from her lips as she found herself gazing into the glittering eyes of the man standing next to her the man who had so nearly knocked her down two weeks earlier For a moment the room and everything else faded into the background and she was aware of nothing but him as their eyes met He looked equally  astounded Suddenly he smiled and his eyes lit up Tembi snapped out of her trance-like state and she saw her father propel his companion towards her Tembi I would like you to meet Nduduzi He's an industrial relations consultant and it is men like him that we call on to help with the staff disputes and problems said <name/> Nduduzi this is my daughter Tembi It is her birthday That's how Tembi and Nduduzi met for a second time in a more civilised manner Nduduzi's work sometimes took him to other centres and being an only child he was very much attached to his parents who lived in Cape Town During the party proceedings Nduduzi took Tembi outside to the veranda There were only two of them The air was cool and the sky was clear and full of stars A full moon hung overhead and its silver light threw the surrounding trees and shrubs into brilliant spectacle Nduduzi started I can't believe I'm here and that I've met you again You won't believe me how many times during the past two weeks your image has haunted me incessantly Nothing like that ever happened to me before Then tonight you turned around when your father spoke and I felt as if I'd been <O/> For a moment I thought I was hallucinating I could see nothing but you I too couldn't believe it when I saw you she whispered in reply He took one of her hands and held it gently and kissed it Have dinner with me tomorrow night he asked still holding her hand and looking deep in her eyes Tembi felt her heart thudding against her rips every nerve then tingling vibrantly with the supercharged sensitivity She shook her head I am sorry Nduduzi I already have a date she replied with genuine regret in her voice Break it he said squeezing her hand away I wouldn't do that to you if it was the other way round and I won't to do it to Roy I'm sorry He means something special to you this Roy Yes he's just a good friend she smiled He relaxed and released his breath Forgive me I had no right to ask you that he said ruefully Monday night then Yes thank you I'd like that very much They met on Monday night and had dinner together Then Nduduzi went to Capetown for two weeks These two weeks were like hell to Tembi When he returned the affair gained overwhelming proportions as writes the author Never again Tembi Nduduzi said in a low intense tone I never want go anywhere else without you ever again I know we only met a short while ago but I have been waiting all my life for you I knew you were the one on the night of your party And the past three weeks have merely confirmed it This time away from you has been sheer hell I love you my darling more than I'll ever be able to tell you You are the other half of me and together we form one perfect unit Do you understand what I am trying to say Of course I understand Being your other half how could I not she replied I love you Nduduzi so very much she whispered her fingers tracing the outlines of his face as if trying to imprint it for ever on her memory Without you  I simply cannot function properly any more I need you to make my life complete I'm yours body and soul <O/> He embraced her and said Marry me Tembi Come and live here and share my home my bed my life and my future with me he asked softly Oh yes I want to be your wife more than anything else in the world she replied without hesitation tears of happiness filling her eyes Then disaster struck Tembi was attacked by polio and got hospitalised The doctors said there was hope she won't be crippled The only consolation is that we believe she will not be crippled Her legs appear to be the only limbs affected her right one more so than the left Of course we could be wrong but present indications are that with intensive physiotherapy and her full co-operation she should be left with little more than a weakness in that leg It was a big blow to her fiancee and her parents After three months although there were signs of improvement the physiotherapy and other factors were too much for Tembi She lost her head When Nduduzi visited her one day she said please forgive me but I have realised that everything has changed I've changed I can't marry you I will be a dreadful burden to you if we were to marry It is going to be a long time before I've recovered sufficiently to be independent I will be able to get about on crutches admittedly but what kind of life will it be for you In your life of business it is essential that you mix socially and entertain and believe me I would be an embarrassment to you No stop it You cannot be an embarrassment to me Oh yes I would Also you and I both want children and I don't know how long it will be before my legs could stand the strength of pregnancy if ever I want your life to be happy and fulfilled Failing to convince her otherwise Nduduzi saw that their love had come to an end He went away angry and confused Tembi meanwhile improved and was discharged She became an outpatient but still used crutches and at times the wheelchair She had already decided to be alone One day she was requested to perform in a charity show for the disabled She agreed After strenuous practice as was a good singer and organist she was soon prepared to perform with other disabled people on stage The day of the charity show came Her performance was electrifying and when the show ended she was given a standing ovation while seated in a wheelchair It was at this time that Tembi looked at the members of the audience getting out of the hall when  she saw Nduduzi escorting a very beautiful lady It dawned on that Nduduzi after what she said to him and he found another lover She got very pained especially on the harsh decision of parting with Nduduzi Anyway bygones were bygones She decided to go to Port Elizabeth with <name/> in order to erase the past On her return from Port Elizabeth she met with Nduduzi who had come to their home Patricia Kage writes Nduduzi what are you doing here I've come to take you home my darling he said his voice low but quite steady Don't touch me Nduduzi as you did not take long to find a replacement for me after the break up did it Then Nduduzi explained himself and Tembi understood My dear Tembi I've missed you so much Nduduzi my dearest Nduduzi please hold me close and don't ever let me go again Then he helped her to sit on the bench then taking her ring from inside pocket of his jacket he again slid it onto the third finger of her left hand repeating the words he had spoken once before With this ring I put my heart and life into your keeping Guard them well my love I will I promise and this time I really mean it no matter what happens She replied in a short voice They stayed for a while arms about each other not quite believing that they were once again together determined never again to be parted Marriage day was fixed Tembi practised walking very hard without using the crutches On the marriage day as Nduduzi set near the alter waiting for  his bride to enter the church he got the amazement of his life The author writes when they arrived in the church <name/> helped her out of the car and <name/> carried then  her flowers As they reached the door leading to the church Tembi stopped and gave her crutches to her father Leave them at the big <ea/>baba We can pick them up later I won't be needing them for a while she said a jubilant smile lighting up her face I've been secretly practising walking without them for weeks I wanted to surprise everybody and from the look on your faces I've certainly succeeded very well <Name/> handed Tembi her flowers and watched as she took her father's arm holding on firmly as the organist started to play the tune Here comes the bride and they started for the alter  Gasps from the multitude made Nduduzi turn to look He was amazed With his eyes ablaze with love and pride he gazed at his beloved Tembi as she walked slowly confidently and triumphantly down the aisle towards him and their future\n<$A> That was Edwin Semsaba reviewing a book titled The Gift of Life by Patricia Kage You have been listening to

{'text': "<$A> You find that uh we have got this uh scramble Yes\n<$B> Scramble means fighting for something\n<$A> Scramble means fighting for something Yes Any idea different from that Anyone with a different idea or do you want to add something from that\n<$B> Scramble is competition against somebody\n<$A> Yes, you are some of you not far from the really <O/> At least there are ideas in there that is Maybe to put it clear Scramble is <O/> or a competition or a struggle for something Now when you come to the term scramble for East Africa This means the struggle for acquisition of territories in East Africa by the European powers And what about \n<$A> Come in And what about partition Yes\n<$B> Partition means dividing the <O/> parts\n<$A> Partition means dividing the \n<$B> <O/> parts\n<$A> <O/> <O/> Okay by definition or partition it's also clear that to straight Do you have any idea\n<$B> <O/> division\n<$A> Okay\n<$B> Partition is a process of dividing an area according to the given or <O/>\n<$A> Okay you have advanced more than the previous one Okay maybe to put it clearly It's more or less the aim that is partition is the division when we refer to East Africa partition is the division of territories by the said given powers Now the partition I mean the scramble and partition of East Africa took place as I told you before that it took place different from that of Africa So it took place for only about sixteen years It took place from eighteen eighty-four to ninteen hundred This is eighteen Now let us now see the causes or the major reasons for the scramble and partition Because we have seen that scramble and partition The European powers they are just scrambling for something for acquisition of something Now what we have to mention is the reason for this scramble and partition We can have some of your views before I add mine\n<$B> They  were finding area for for investment and raw material\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> for their industry \n<$A> okay Yes What do you say <name/>\n<$B> They were struggling for markets\n<$A> For markets My colleague here has said areas for investment and raw materials Come in Another reason Yes\n<$B> Cheap labour\n<$A> Cheap labour Can you find the other one Yes\n<$B> Markets for manufactured goods\n<$A> Markets for their manufactured goods Now you have mentioned these reasons They are obvious but they all fall under the major reason which is titled the industrial revolution Now these are the demands which are created by the industrial revolution That means as you read from the previous topic that there was the rise of the industrial revolution and this industrial revolution in Europe created a lot of demands and these are some of the demands which they wanted That is the European countries wanted to acquire these demands in Africa and in East Africa So this is one of the  reasons as to why the European countries came to East Africa to acquire colonies or territories Another reason is the rise of monopolies That means the European countries wanted very much as The European countries wanted to acquire colonies in Africa and other parts of the world due to their ambition By then there was an ambition of European countries Most European countries wanted to acquire colonies It was just as as we can say a prestige <O/> If some a certain country will be having a colony then it will be called a big nation So this can we we can put can putRRR it here that the rise of monopolies as one of the major reasons  Germany Britain I mean Italy by then and other European countries were struggling very much to acquire colonies together with Portugal as you read from the previous topic about the agents which were sent to Africa and the other parts of East Africa the explorers All these were agents They went there to see the potentiality or the potential of the land which will be explored in Africa As we have can we have another reason so far If at all you can see or you can think about it Yes\n<$B> The increase in population in their countries\n<$A> The increase in population Somebody said that but to defend it needs a lot of explanation I may explain it just to put it clear That is by eighteen eighty-four or by the century seventeen the seventeenth century it was there was a rise of population in Europe And the population was much to the extent that these areas for investment let's say to establish plantations was very difficult very difficultRRR because the areas were all populated So the rise of population in Europe caused the European countries to send some of the population to come to Africa and other parts of East Africa so that they can reduce but this reason is always taken as a minor not major essential But it is one of the reasons due to the fact that once people were running bankrupt that means they didn't have money and they decided to come to East Africa so that they can be employed You know if a country is having a lot of population then definitely there will be no employment But the employment by then were only available in East Africa to run the administration administration activities and other uh employment or occupation So this population can be one but mind you if you put it as one of your reasons you must defend it thoroughly It needs a lot of explanation Even now by the moment I have explained it in a short way But I think these are some of the reasons for the scramble for and the partition East Africa The other reason which I may put it is that Britain by eighteen eighty-four was already having the territories of Egypt and the Suez Canal So as you know Egypt is using a lot of Let's say the population of Egypt is only centred along the river Nile So definitely the river Nile is essential to the lives of the population of Egypt Since then Egypt was using efficiently that river Nile and you know definitely that the river the source of the river Nile is East Africa and some parts in Somalia around Ethopia but a lot of water comes from East Africa When Egypt I mean Britain controlled was running or <O/> Egypt then Britain is so essential or was responsible Actually it was just pretending as if that She was just was justRRR pretending as if that since we have taken Egypt we must also take parts of East Africa which the source of the river Nile comes from So we can put it that Britain wanted monopoly in East Africa since it had already occupied Egypt Britain wanted monopoly in East Africa because she has already occupied Egypt which use the source of the river Nile which of which the source of the river Nile is where In East Africa So that is these are among the reasons which you find but these are the major ones These are some books which are trying to explain some other reasons but they tend to mix up For instance the industrial revolution has got these reasons as independent but we can put them together as or we can arrange them adjacent Now we have seen the reasons for the scramble for and the partition <O/> I want to go to the partition process As I told you that the partition process in Africa was somehow different from the partition of Africa Now the partition of East Africa went through the mainly we can say two processes through the agreements of three countries namely Britain Germany and the Sultan of Zanzibar But for the agreements which we can consider now is We can consider two agreements that made for the partition of East Africa The first one is Anglo-Germany Agreement of eighteen eighty-six and the second one is Anglo-German Agreement of nineteen hundred Now let me show you how the partition was by using a map which I drew The reasons for their agreement was of course that to settle their problems so that they cannot they can no longer go on scrambling or struggling for acquisitionof  colonies or territories They decided now the following British took the Kenya mainland except some parts that are indicated on the map This is Kenya but Uganda by then was not colonised or taken by any country It was free You remember the kingdoms were still dominating there For instance Presidents <name/> <name/> I mean <name/> etcera And <name/> together with <name/> was taken by Germany This is what they agreed The coastal strip this is ten-mile coastal strip together with Zanzibar and in the following towns <nmae/> <name/> Mogadischu and <name/>  were taken by the Sultan of Zanzibar This is what they agreed for the first Anglo-German Agreement of eighteen eighty-six For the first for the second Anglo-German agreement of eighteen I mean of nineteen hundred they agreed the following This is the map which was obtained by eighteen I mean nineteen It is by eighteen nineteen nineteen nineteen ninety-four I'm sorry <O/> This is nineteen hundred by nineteen I mean nineteen nought four So they agreed the following but for this agreement the second agreement the Sultan of Zanzibar was no longer considered That means Britain took the whole part of Kenya Uganda together with the previous part which was obtained by the Sultan of Zanzibar That is Zanzibar Zanzibar was now always given a certain part as is shown it is shown on the map here but this part was also under control under the control of though the capital of Zanzibar was given this part it was also under control of the Sultan I mean the British  Germany was now given the whole mainland of Tanzania today So I say  Germany was given Tanzania How do you take this all this I'm now waiting for your questions about the logic as a whole but I have a few comments on the <O/> agreement which was settled I was discussing with the previous uh class when they introduced another topic I mean another point they showed Helgoland This you may have read this Helgoland or you have you may have read this Helgoland Treaty This Helgoland is just an island in the North Sea Do you know the North Sea where it is Where is it Anyway the North Sea is just near the Greenland in near It's near Greenland So it just an island in the North Sea Helgoland was by then not taken by either Italy or other parts I mean other countries except it was being scrambled by British by the British and the  Germans So during the Anglo-German Agreement of nineteen hundred they decided that this part of I mean this island should be taken by the  Germans That's why in other literature or in other books you find the Anglo-German Agreement of nineteen hundred is known as Helgoland Treaty or Helgoland Agreement Now I allow you to ask questions\n<$B> So you have said the second agreement the Sultan he was she was not was notRRR involved \n<$A> Yes\n<$B> Why with the first agreement he was very involved \n<$A> Yes\n<$B> while the first agreement he involved Sultan I don't know why\n<$A> I have said that for the first time he was very much involved just because when  Germans came as I showed you on the map here he was apported a big actually a vast land So when the British and the  Germans came they were supposed to consider also the area to be taken by the Sultan of Zanzibar Remember the Sultan of Zanzibar Said Said shifted the capital from Mecca or Muscat \n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Muscat\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Okay Muscat to Zanzibar in the eighteen forties So it was this was very somehow very very very near or it shows when this scramble for and partition by of East Africa by eighteen eighty-four by the European by the European powers then it shows this is far away from eighteen forties when the Said Said shifted his capital", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$B> I don't think my colleague has told something about the factors of the collapse\n<$A> He didn't tell about the factors which led factors which led to the collapse of feudal mode of production Yes \n<$B> I think they haven't talked about the characteristics of feudal mode of production\n<$A> They didn't tell anything about the characteristics of feudal mode of production Completely that the group hasn't telled anything completely \n<$?> No\n<$A> Yes I heard something\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> \n<$B> <Name/> feudalism consists of two classes landlords and the serfs The serfs were not slaves because they had land to build their homes Also they owned their instruments of labour Exploitation of serfs rested on the landlords controlling the major means of production So this paragraph shows how the characteristics of what feudalism was\n<$A> Characteristics\n<$B> Yes\n<$?> Yes sir\n<$B> in this book they have written one in this <O/>\n<$A> which book\n<$B> I think it is written by <name/>\n<$A> <name/>\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Which one There are many books written by <name/>\n<$B>\n<$A> No centralised state in feudal mode of production How do you perceive it Our friend is saying that he referred to a certain book written by <name/>and he got the point that in feudal mode of production no exploitation of serfs\n<$B>could you please explain us more widely or openly so that we can know what is it what is he talking about when he said centralised state \n<$A> Who can help you Who can answer <name/>\n<$B> I didn't understand the question Who has asked the question Maybe you can tell us\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> What\n<$B> <O_><O/> I mean there is no situation of power\n<$B> What\n<$B> There is no situation of power\n<$B> How\n<$B> How I think because when you have a feudal mode of production one of the men should be the one who has got the power so the kings has no power\n<$B> The kings were having power because\n<$B> No you serfs you were supposed to pay something in return of the use of what of land \n<$B> land Yes \n<$B> Why can you say there was no power \n<$A> Just don't quarrel We are not quarrelling\n<$B> Yes\n<$B> So I think there was <O/> model there was a <O/> power For the feudal lord it meant that they put power upon the serfs So the serfs were responsible to do what to do work for the lords so it means that all the powers were upon the lords \n<$A> \n<$B> Yes sir \n<$B> Yes <O_><O/> because you have a good point Another feature of feudalism mode of production is that there is no strong centralised power political power industrialised or centralising such that the King is just one among the lords The feudal lords had their own private funds and the tenants\n<$A> Okay the way you said they had no centralised power and in the reference you'll find it in your book you are saying that there was no strong centralised power power\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Therefore there was weak centralised power isn't it \n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Okay what I will tell you is that Anyway do you have examples of feudal modes of production in some parts of Africa\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Like where\n<$B> Nigeria\n<$A> Where\n<$B> Nigeria\n<$A> Nigeria \n<$B> in East Africa\n<$A> Nigeria At what time \n<$B> Imperial time\n<$B> Nineteenth century\n<$A> In the nineteenth\n<$B> Nineteenth century\n<$A> Eighteenth\n<$B> Century \n<$A> Good\n<$B> In the <O/> region specifically in <name/> isn't it \n<$?> Yes \n<$A> That is where you can trace the <O/>\n<$A> So then we can also cite our example to Egypt \n<$B> during Pharaoh\n<$A> Egypt during Pharaoh Egypt during Pharaoh there was a kind of feudalism there So in the in terms of the expressions of our friend that there was no strong centralised power Do you get the point that Ghana has a weak centralised power Can you take the point that <O/> kingdom was or was not a centralised kingdom \n<$B> Centralised kingdom\n<$A> It was\n<$?> A centralised kingdom \n<$A> What about Egypt during Pharaoh\n<$B> A centralised\n<$A> It was centralised\n<$?> Yes \n<$A> So in the case of Africa one can take a point that these kingdoms which we can refer giving examples were highly centralised but even our friends in Europe the mode of production didn't encourage the centralisation the strong centralisation of state Because if this was the land owned by one feudal lord This is the land You may take an example that this land is There are routes somewhere  towns and the other portion nearby this is taken by another feudal lord so those people were leaders of these particular places Okay \n<$?> Yes\n<$A> And once you cross this particular place you will find that some rules guiding that particular place And once you go to the left you'll find another different kind of rules guiding that particular place If it is just paying tax or tributes you will pay tribute in this place or be <O/> a feudal lord or you'll also go on paying at least in each feudal lord you give a tribute until you reach the place you'll stay So that's how our friend can substantiate his point that there was no strong centralised state There was no one who was at the <O/> Okay there was no one who was at the <O/> like the kings of <O/> So that's how we can deal with that one Anything which you may think that our friends' presentation is lacking or you make corrections Anything Okay another thing I think our friends did not discuss\n<$A> Louder please\n<$B> They defined the term feudalism but they haven't explained the cause of this feudalism\n<$A> The cause of feudalism What our friend is trying to say is that that group which presented didn't show what was the mode of production just above or just before feudalism so those of you that presentation started without introducing us what was the former mode of production What was the former mode of production before feudalism \n<$?> slavery\n<$A> So those guys didn't show us that feudalism took place after slavery Okay Starting from the beginning what do you think were the reasons for the salient reasons for the collapse of feudalism the salient reasons leaving those minor reasons What were the salient reasons which led to the collapse of feudal mode of production Who can try Yes\n<$B> Increase of population and the growth of society\n<$A> There was an increase of population Yes Once you refer to Uganda you find that it was highly populated and there are some reasons why it was highly populated Another reason That's one\n<$B> Increase in size in wealth \n<$A> Accumulation of wealth That is another point that people started to accumulate wealth and to privatise some kind of property Another reason Another thing you may think was the major reason for the collapse \n<$B> There was no surplus\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> There was no surplus\n<$A> It was\n<$B> There was no surplus\n<$A> \n<$B> surplus\n<$A> Give me spelling here\n<$B> S U \n<$A> S\n<$B> S U R P \n<$A> Oh this one\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> What is this Okay there was no surplus There was no surplus Okay There was no surplus How could the lack of surplus facilitate the collapse Can you tell How did absence of surplus facilitate the collapse \n<$B> Since there was no surplus between the mass population the increase of population so it led it *leds> to famine\n<$A> So what was the outcomes \n<$B> Let me finish When the hunger happened there were some people who were owning the surplus and so people who were <O/> they came to them\n<$A> Any other thing to contribute Yes\n<$B> Specialisation\n<$A> You tell me this is a reason for collapse\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> No there was no specialisation How did you tell this\n<$B> Specialisation is the a what a communal mode of production \n<$A> A communal mode of production\n<$B> Actually uh there was specialisation but after that specialisation came into the into another stage whereby other specialisation didn't it didn't benefit some group of people For example there were some groups who were only uh were onlyRRR gatherers while others were toolmakers so we can see that the toolmakers became somehow somewhat They had wealth so the groups started\n<$A> Do you get the point of what our friend is saying \n<$?> Yes\n<$A> So this specialisation created an ample room for some people to own means of production and others not for those for instance those <O/> who gathered <O_><O/> because they didn't settle after all they were just moving here and there looking for what they can consume While these ones who settled uh involved themselves in some activities such as those ones our friend have mentioned so there was now creation of surplus Any other thing you can see that that can be the reason Now let me give you a question We still have some tribes in Tanzania such as Masai and we have another group that <name/> they are more or less the same because they are farming the same region \n<$B> Sandawe \n<$A> Sandawe more or less the same people I know Sandawe is Kiswahili\n<$B> <O/>\n<$A> \n<$B> <O/>\n<$A> Give me the spelling\n<$B>A R B A \n<$A> A\n<$B> \n<$B> N\n<$A> N That one\n<$B> I\n<$A> That one\n<$B> I\n<$A> This One\n<$B> G G \n<$A> Instead of this one\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> From where\n<$B> From <name/>\n<$A> But now the southern part of Africa Which one\n<$B> Bushmen\n<$A> bushmen Okay in the explanations about specialisation you said that some people specialised in gathering and hunting uh while others settled and started to do some activities Hence it resulted into the acquisition of wealth What about these people What about these people in Tanzania and in the southern part of Africa We know that these people are just nearby societies which are civilised Okay\n<$?> Yes\n<$A> What is the problem of these people I think it's induced with knowledge of gathering and hunting or depending on nature <O_><O/> What is the reason behind anyway Who can try to find out what can be the reason why these people are still relying on nature while they have some societies which are advanced and are civilised just nearby them Why are they going on procuring They are going on procuring They depend solely on nature Why Is there any reason We bring them schools in order to be civilised they run away towards the bushes You build them houses still they can't live in our houses our modern houses What do you think can be the reason They are still in communal mode of production I remember one year the government built a school for those people to get educated and built houses for those people to live but no one from those responded and they were taken by force to live in those houses but sometimes later nobody was found there They ran away Can you tell me the reason Yes\n<$B> Maybe I'll just try \n<$A> Yes\n<$B> Maybe they because they come from local place\n<$A> What\n<$B> Local community\n<$A> Our friend thinks they are going to make local <O/>\n<$B> I think these people will just fight such a system mode of production so once they <O/> let's say you bring them for example here at school they can't live here because this place differs from where they are living in their forests\n<$A> But we are still scrutinising their satisfaction Why are they satisfied with that situation\n<$B> I hope they lean so much on their tradition\n<$A> Our friend hopes that they lean very much on their tradition\n<$B> Probably they are hunters \n<$A> They\n<$B> Hunters They hunt so they prefer hunting \n<$A> Yes but why are they going on hunting They can't stop hunting uh Why We brought them school and modern buildings in order to separate them from that situation of going on hunting but they still absconded our buildings and went into the bushes <name/>\n<$B> Maybe they are primitive\n<$A> They are primitive Yes Okay conclusively the reason as to why these people are satisfied with this situation is that Had it been that these people liked the complexity of life <O_><O/> Everything is available for these people Animals are were there Fruits are there and roots Everything is there In case animals finished these people could shift Okay Yes\n<$B> Why did they not stop when they had a chance\n<$A> Why did they not stop when they had a chance\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> I have said that the complexity of life For instance in other places people went on hunting", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$A> Okay I hope you are all fine and some of you I have met already And uh as I can remember we last time were able to cover the book and the theme not the themes but character I mean the plot as well as uh the setting I think you remember that So uh can you remind me uh anything that we said on the setting the setting because today we shall be able to discuss uh Yes we were able to cover with you the setting as well as the plot What did we say was the setting of the dilemma of a ghost the dilemma of a ghost Can you remind me of that Yes The dilemma of a ghost what did we say What did we say was the setting of this play\n<$B> It is in a very broad form\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> The setting is in a very broad form\n<$A> uh in a very broad form uh So what is it about What is the setting I mean where are we told this play was uh constructed How uh was it prepared and so on Where was it acted uh Yes\n<$B> In Ghana\n<$A> Yes we are told that play is uh about Ghana a Ghanaian you remember who that Ghanaian is okay and then uh where is it being acted yes yes\n<$B> Somewhere in the continent of America\n<$A> Yeah it starts right uh somewhere in the continent of America where two graduates are discussing \n<$B> <O/>\n<$A> <O/> two graduates are discussing some affairs about how they will be looking like when they go back to Ghana Okay And then it is acted outside the the traditional house Okay uh in the courtyard Okay You remember that And then what did we say is the plot uh What did you say is the plot of this play the plot You remember what a plot is uh the time span covered throughout the whole play uh\n<$B> It took place for about one year and two weeks \n<$A> Sure it is uh it took place for about it is acted uh in a period of one year and two weeks about and it is stated in the book I think we were able to cite uh where the writer tries to tell us the time it takes uh to act this play Now today we are going to look at themes Themes as well as characterisation Yes I asked you to go and prepare some answers but then before you start presenting your answer I mean presenting I would want to explain to you what themes are When you read any work of art be it a novel a play uh or even poems uh when we talk of themes we mean the main ideas of the work of art the main ideas What are the main ideas found in any work of art uh What do does the uh uh author or the writer want uh to say want to convey to us So those are known as themes in just simple terms Okay Then when we talk of characterisation we actually mean uh what uh everything that is said by the characters how they have been used by the author to convey the message he wants to put across Okay So here we come out with the idea of main character minor characters and so on Are we together\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> Now that you know what themes are and what uh characterisation is I think you are able to in your groups to come and present uh or even no you can do it where you are but it could be a good idea if you sit in your groups Okay Now who were assigned to present uh on themes who were assigned to present on themes uh yes Who else Nobody else Yes you Okay you were three four One is missing it seems Where is Pauline Moses sick uh She is at home Okay Now uh can you come closer and maybe have a common seat somewhere so that you can present it and you'll be asked questions and I think you can be in a position to answer uh Okay But you shouldn't feel afraid One of you who is the chairperson Who is the chairperson of the group uh So can you please present where you are Just stay where you are to avoid some inconveniences\n<$B>\n<$A> Are you through Get seated Yes Any question to what he has just presented How many themes have you mentioned \n<$B> Two themes\n<$A> Two themes The first one The first theme Yes his good mates I think you can try to assist him You can assist him because he is not supposed to speak alone You have to work as a team Yes uh The first theme yes What has he mentioned as the first theme \n<$B> Dilemma\n<$A> The theme of dilemma good What is there Very good What is there in the theme of dilemma uh What makes it a dilemma What is a dilemma Actually I think you know what a dilemma is Yes Who can tell me Who can tell us what a dilemma is yes\n<$B> Traditional education\n<$A> Traditional education That is something that causes a dilemma part of the character uh traditional education What does it do What does traditional education do to cause a dilemma uh <O/> Can you tell us what the tradition does I mean what traditional education does to Ato in such a way that he's found a dilemma\n<$B> It makes him argue with his wife \n<$A> uh yeah So dilemma you know what it is When Once a person is pulled on both sides When a person is pulled on both sides uh Say he has got to achieve this and he has got to achieve this one here so he is standing here inbetween uh He can't go in that way in the other way and that way He wants to go to this direction at the same time he wants to even maintain this direction So this is you are saying western culture isn't it Western education education and then here you have what else here You have traditional customs isn't it So actually this is Ato He doesn't want to offend his parents Okay and at the same time he doesn't want to do away with western education This actually keeps him in dilemma uh So you see and uh what makes it that I mean who can try to justify this dilemma uh Where is it said like this uh Where do we see ever expression indicating dilemma of that sort uh I think you mentioned it You mentioned somewhere if I was fully aware You mentioned uh something like when uh Ato's mother brought the snails uh uh as a reward to her uh children uh and what did Yurani say uh uh regarding those rewards What did Yurani say uh\n<$B> She was disgusted\n<$A> She was disgusted and she rejected those snails and they said after all seeing snails and eating snails are two different things I may have seen snails at home in United States but it doesn't mean I have eaten them So she threw them away isn't it So uh but when Ato is asked about this incident what does he say He tries to defend the United States After all he doesn't know how to cope with them you see So that means trying to defend what western culture because uh Ato's mother thought that all those rewards could be accepted without any question But you see uh they are rejected altogether And then here again he tries to defend western culture And now again on the other example what does uh You mentioned it also that Yurani is married She hasn't given birth to any child Okay And now what does uh uh what do the I mean Ato's uh relatives say about this What do they say Yes the group neighbours\n<$B> They want to wash the womb\n<$A> They want to wash Yurani's womb isn't it And what does he Is Yurani ready I mean ready to be washed\n<$B> No\n<$A> She is not ready Okay But then what does Ato say about Yurani's barrenness Is he happy about the situation uh What does he say\n<$B> <O/>\n<$A> He might have said Oh what's wrong with my wife So he doesn't agree with the concept of washing you know the idea of washing uh Yurani's stomach and what not After all uh both Yurani and Ato don't find it barrenness anyway They say they haven't yet decided to get the kid isn't it \n<$B> Yes\n<$A> That's what they said So again we find even in a certain instance where Ato I mean Yurani insults uh Ato's relatives What does she say about Ato's uh relatives brothers and uncles uh Yes\n<$B> They are uncivilised\n<$A> They yeah She says they are uncivilised And what does Ato do uh responding to such kind of a thing \n<$B> He slaps her \n<$A> He slaps her So you see this is another <O/> you know Despite the fact that there is love between Ato and uh Yurani they reach a point where Ato defends Yurani and at the same time uh Ato uh tries to even grow negative against Yurani For example when he slaps her uh he slaps herRRR This indicates that he is angered with what he was saying okay she was saying So this is a dilemma he doesn't know where to go He wants to go this way but he fails He wants to go that way he fails So he is somewhere inbetween Can you tell me another another theme That was one theme Another theme Yes\n<$B> the theme of conflict\n<$A> Yes very good The theme of conflict How does uh the author uh explain uh this theme How does he explain the theme Can you tell me uh Can you explain Yes we know there is a theme of conflict but uh how is it being explained So there is a theme here of dilemma Then there is a theme of conflict What is said on this theme of conflict Yes I think you have read this uh and I told you to go and prepare this Yes What uh does the author say uh to show the conflict that is found in the in the book Think if you got uh yes\n<$B> It started from the time they returned to the village\n<$A> Yes uh Just as Ato visits I mean Ato and his wife decided to go back to their village is when we see uh the conflicts But what do this uh what is the conflict all about uh I think you remember that there is This Ato is a Ghanaian who has uh got a European I mean Western education Okay And then his wife also is a graduate also completed his her uh degree course there in America isn't it and now uh Yurani is he's an Afro-American isn't it and then Ato is a Ghanaian person So once they come back from their workplace they come to pay visit to their village Ato's village we find that from the beginning that the ways that the ways of life that are there in Ato's village are different from the ways of life that are in America you see And this is what makes Ato uh fail to even cope with the lifestyles of the village there and it also makes Yurani very uh difficult to understand these things So he throws away those snails Okay it's one sign of conflict And then uh what else do we see She insults uh Ato's parents So we see the conflict between traditional again it is traditional ways of life ways against western ways of life But then if I asked you uh if I were to ask you can you tell me uh what are those traditional ways of life found in Ghana for example can you mention them uh as far as your understanding is concerned Can you try What are the traditional ways of life there in Ghana uh What are those traditional ways of life Yes\n<$B> Barrenness is treated there\n<$A> Yes barrenness is treated as a case Actually it's treated as a case and it's not even well taken in that society So they believe that once people are married they should bare children They don't have any idea of you know family planning and so on Any other things Thank you Any other", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM',

{'text': "<$A> some historical aspects which have to deal first with because it's all history So with concepts of history we're definitely going to discuss about class production relation and modes of production Class production relation and modes of production So we shall start directly to define some concepts in this topic The first concept we should define is production\n<$A> Yes\n<$A> Yes come in\n<$B> Good morning Sir\n<$A> Good morning So this topic is very important because any human being any human being needs in order to survive he needs three main things or in order to survive he needs three essential things What are they who can mention one Yes <name/> \n<$B> Food shelter\n<$A> I said who can mention one Okay Food The other \n<$B> Shelter\n<$A> Shelter The last\n<$B> Clothes\n<$A> Clothes Good So all these will basically come as a result of work or as a result of labour So human being in the first time of his existence he found that he was *subjecteded> to the work and he was therefore in an attempt to struggle against two things In the first place the first human being struggled against two things Who can try to mention one thing things maybe the first human struggled against mmh\n<$B> Struggled to get food\n<$A> Struggled to get food Struggled to get food\n<$B> Good morning Sir\n<$A> Good morning Another thing Yes try\n<$B> He struggled to change his environment\n<$A> struggled to change his environment struggled to change his environment Now what can we do with these things is that the first man struggled in the first place against nature Okay He struggled against nature and struggling against nature is where the results of <O/> today That human being had to survive and surviving needed him to possess food and to possess food needed him to involve himself in labour to produce so that he can gain some food So that was in the first place In the second place man was subjected in a position to struggle against his fellow man his fellow colleague So you find that man was subjected to nature and to his fellow man So after that is when after finishing that then we can proceed with giving some divisions to our terminologies or concepts\n<$B> Please Sir\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> You have said that the man struggled against nature and then secondly his fellow man \n<$A> Yes\n<$B> his fellow man how\n<$A> Okay this man Anyway secondly before going back to answering the question of our fellow explained who can try to think about how man can struggle against man Who can try to find something how man can struggle against another man Anyone who can try Okay this man has to struggle to get relations Okay Relations between man or between man to man or relations among men Who can tell me that all the members of the class are his friends Is there anybody who exists who can tell me that all of these members of class are his friends is it \n<$B> Yes\n<$A> They are your friends\n<$B> Yes\n<$A> But you definitely must have a friend of yours who is closer than others isn't it That is one kind of relation That's one kind of relation Am I wrong\n<$?> No\n<$A> That is one kind of relation But in the other way you will have some members of your class who not like you or not love you Not necessarily that they can show you that they don't love you but they are there and they don't love you So that is still a relationship isn't it \n<$?> Yes\n<$A> So you have all kinds of relationship So in the first place there was the human being had to struggle to get harmonious or friendly relationship uh to his fellow man In the second place these people as they went on producing they found themselves that some were having new products others were not having products And I don't think if there is a good relationship or friendly relationship between the one who is rich and the one who is poor Is that not true Do we have harmonious or friendly relationship between those two kind of people\n<$?> No\n<$A> We don't have So these people were struggling against harmonious relationship which later has resulted into the formation of disharmonious or unfriendly relationship I think I have answered the question\n<$B> Yes Sir\n<$A> Any addition any addition because I might have left some points and people who feel that I have left some points they can add Is there anything else I have forgotten So we said that two productive forces I think and probably it is definitely true that this is not the first place or the first time you see this terminology isn't it I presume that this is not the first time you see this terminology Who can try to define what are the productive forces Who can try to define what are the productive forces Who can try Anybody Yes Try\n<$B> Productive forces in my consideration I consider that they are those facilities used in production\n<$A> Good try Anybody who can try Anybody else who can try What are the productive forces What are the productive forces Yes \n<$B> I hope productive forces are those factors which are concerned in the creation of material\n<$A> Yes It's very good \n<$B> Productive forces are the forces which are used in production of materials\n<$A> Very good Okay I think through or by observing those three views we can simply say that man has necessarily to live basically depending on producing food uh preparing shelter for his uh protection and clothes So because he wants these things he has to involve himselves to find the productive forces things that can facilitate him to obtain these things Okay So productive forces are the things which can facilitate the activity of man to achieve these uh three essentials Any other view concerning the productive forces Who can mention any way Who can try to give the examples of the what can be productive forces I'm not interested in the one hand Yes try\n<$B> Land\n<$A> Land \n<$B> Human labour\n<$A> Human labour Try\n<$B> Capital\n<$A> Capital Any other example Yes\n<$B> Enterpreneurship\n<$A> Enterpreneurship Any other example Any other example apart from those given those on the blackboard Yes\n<$B> Specialization\n<$A> Specialization I saw another hand just behind you Somebody was raising his hand So \n<$B> Yes Sir\n<$A> Yes\n<$B> I think you do have <O/> which are which is the productive process but I think some of us have given a lot of definitions but we're coming to this <O/> where you have been saying that yes we could try try try but we don't know which is new \n<$A> about productive forces\n<$B> Yes because I don't know which because there were great divisions so I don't know which is which \n<$A> I think in the after the definitions of from your colleagues I said that productive forces are things which facilitate the <O/> Okay So I said isn't it Only that you say you were busy so that you I said that productive forces are the things which facilitate a human being to acquire or obtain his basic needs You remember So it is for not for the benefit of our friend but even those that are <O/> here So after having seen what we can say about productive forces let's try to find some other possible concepts within the major concept of productive process There is one concept under productive process which is human labour Human labour I think human labour is supposed to be the component of the productive process It is the component or it is just one one among many which compose the productive process as in the definition some of our colleagues where I said that enterpreneurship specialization all those kinds will be found in the course of our discussion on human labour So who can try to tell what can be uh what you can say about human labour or in terms of defining or giving some sort of expressions what you can say What can you say about human labour Giving expressions or descriptions or even if possible to tell the definition \n<$B> Human labour we can say is refered to as the form of work in production\n<$A> The form of work in order to produce Okay He has given such a definition Who can try Another one who can try Another else Try\n<$B> Human labour is energy or ability \n<$A> Energy or \n<$B> ability\n<$A> ability \n<$B> <O/>\n<$A> Yes Okay human labour includes or in the first place human labour Yes labour is a purposeful or is a a purposeful or intended activity done by human being which depends on a skill or man experience scientific and technical knowledge So human labour is as I have said is an intended activity done by human being and it is basically depending on skill experience experience uh and scientific and technical knowledge For all those ones who might not have heard it properly it is an intended activity directed at the production it is an intended activity directed at the production of the necessary product and it is solely dependent on these factors skill experience scientific and technical knowledge Anybody who has a different concept or a different idea uh idea from those ones which are given on the blackboard Anybody else who has something to add or something to express in addition to the subject Anybody So this one is clear It is clear\n<$?>Yes\n<$A> So after that let's go to another concept Objects of labour of labourRRR Who can try to think about what is what can object of labour mean Who can try to tell us what he feels this can be Anyone who can try Yes\n<$B> Uh Instruments which can be used to simplify a certain human activity \n<$A> Yes any other Any other Any other Try You can try Who else can try Are you satisfied with the expressions of our colleague Are you satisfied \n<$B> Yes\n<$A> So you want to say that what your colleague was thinking you as well were thinking it isn't it uh Who was seriously thinking another way different from our fellow's expressions So you were thinking the same thing all of you Is it \n<$B> Yes\n<$A> uh Who was thinking the other way round Tell what you were thinking or what you think Tell what you think Yes\n<$B> Object of labour are facilities to which the human skill and experience are directed\n<$A> This is another fair definition Someone was raising his hand We contribute various views\n<$B> Object of labour includes man and his <O/>\n<$A> Yes and still other views are here mh Any other contribution Yes\n<$B> I think object of labour is any human activity to maximize production\n<$A> To maximize production Okay Objects of labour are the things which are subjected to man's labour Objects of labour are the things which are subjected to man's labour An example of a thing which can be subjected to man's labour Who can tell us what is that Yes\n<$B> Land is one of those\n<$A> Land good land is something which is subjected to man's labour Good So land is the most important object of labour which is subjected to man Who has some other views different from these ones Is this clear \n<$?> Yes\n<$A> It's important to note that these objects of labour are the things which are subjected to man's labour A good example is land Okay\n<$?> Yes\n<$A> Let us shift to another concept This is means of labour I hope you can see what I write You can see\n<$?> Yes\n<$A> Means of labour If we have discussed about human labour objects of labour what can be an appropriate expressions for means of labour What can be an appropriate expression for means of labour Means of labour of labourRRR <name/> Yes\n<$B> Means of labour are the things which human being having a human labour and object of labour can produce\n<$A> Yes it is fairly good Yes\n<$B> Are the way from which he can obtain labour force\n<$A> The ways from which he can obtain labour force Any other different view from those two views given by our colleagues", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM',

method in teaching science and maths in Zanzibar However the science and maths books on enquiry method produced in June workshop nineteen ninety-three were also on <O/>\n<$A> So when we go to the workshop room or working room we see so many materials in front of us in our rooms and the problem will be posed there on that particular topic that you will be required to investigate After posing the problem then we go to another stage which is formation of questions After being supplied with materials you will have to look to the material and form as many questions as possible on those particular materials that you have been provided So those questions which you will look at have to investigate on them So after posing the questions then you will have to do activities which include investigations You will do observation while doing the activities From there you will be will beRRR required to record whatever you see Record the observation whatever you see while you are doing whatever is happening A lot of things might happen while you are interacting with materials After recording then we come to report You will have to report whatever is happening in that \n<$B> In fact now Group A B and C will remain in this room D E and F\n<$C> Seeds and other materials were provided\n<$D> You will be provided with a variety of and we them \n<$E> Varieties of seeds and the answer we observe thirteen varieties of seeds\n<$F> Some seeds have got two cotyledons and some seeds have got uh one cotyledon\n<$E> The external structure of seed consisted three parts and the first one micropyle responsible for the <O/> of water and scar uh for example in  beans there are various sizes of seeds Some show small sizes second one shows medium sizes and some the large size\n<$F> uh On measuring we found that the size of a coconut uh a groundnut it has uh it is one point eight  centimetres long We found that some uh crushed the seeds in some solutions and see what happens when uh uh what result we get\n<$E> The seeds they take to germinate \n<$?> Reporting time The groups reported what they have seen and observed\n<$D> Generally we found that all the seeds all seeds have xylem they have micropyle Some are easily seen and some are not until you are going to use uh I mean a scientific uh uh instrument to <O/> and they all have seed coats Then we tried to look at the internal structure of some seeds We look on uh maize and at beans Maize has monocot and beans has dicot So in maize we found that the seed after remaining the seed coat or after dissecting it we found that maize has one cotyledon Plumule and radicle are not easily seen They are present but they are not easily seen and cotyledons are hard to split I mean that if you want that if you want to split cotyledons you can see that it is hard but on the side of uh beans <O/> we found that it contains two cotyledons Plumule and radicle are easily seen so that they are easily to split uh Here the coconut and the groundnut uh If I want to split you can see it is easily to be split Then into the background to show the external and internal structures of the bean splits Here bean's uh xylem micropyle and seed coats then dissect uh dissect it and find the <O/> plumule and cotyledons External structure this is internal structure then we tried to do maize by iodine We tried to <O/> We found that the external uh <O/> xylem position of embryo and the position of cotyledon and also of scar and internal <O/> there is endosperms <O/> scar <O/> radicle plumule and <O/>\n<$G> uh If am right I am rightRRR on what I hear from you uh you said that uh coconuts store water\n<$D> Yah\n<$G> Did you test for that How did you test\n<$D>uh I ground them Then I found there is water\n<$G> Really\n<$D> Really\n<$G> Is water\n<$D> Yes\n<$G> Did you boil it\n<$D> I didn't but I saw water\n<$G> That is not water\n<$D> I saw\n<$G> uh The last question Did you said that you said that you removed air\n<$D> \n<$G> in the test tube by using caustic soda Is that right\n<$D> \n<$G> What I know is that you can remove carbon dioxide by using caustic soda and not air\n<$D> This may indeed be true\n<$G> Is that the external structure of seeds consist three parts and the first one micropyle responsible for interraise of water uh scar uh for example in beans appears as a white <O/> and the uh surrounding coat known as dicot\n<$C> One among the methods in which is used to preserve food from to preserve uh seeds is by smoking How smoke help to preserve food \n<$E> A crop for example maize uh anything \n<$A> Other questions are too far from where we are going\n<$?> Okay\n<$B> and actually we are \n<$A> in the sense that what he has presented is from their own experience They never did it practically during the activity So we cannot ask too far in the background in its information \n<$C> What happens when light falls uh on the breaking surface Well there is a tension somewhere in the\n<$H> tested us was when we are dealing with these we have seen some interesting things Those we have seen that when we look at them look at themRRR we saw some silvery colour instead of being colourless like this or greenish like this we can see some as silvery part here For example at the base at their bases so we  wonder where does this come from and also we tried to take them when I put them on the words given we put the words here and the words here there and  suddenly we saw some strange things Instead of seeing UN we saw that the thing like this and so that image was very interesting to us We ask ourselves where does this come from but the answer could not come into our minds and we get the same thing on the word BE but reflected in other way like this and the picture came this way But we want our teachers to help us This is from my observations I hope it is a sort of various types or various reflections and one of these comments was that here there was a sort of <O/> and this one the second one and the third one I understand as the first the second the third in the other side That is what I observed and what uh have given me a sort of idea it is caused by combination of reflections\n<$I> There is a real position of the objects inside the vessel here as we used it uh If someone can't see the diagram I think you can see this uh This is the real position at the bottom of the container or at the bottom of this beaker but if someone tries to observe where it is where is it inside by looking above the liquid he probably will see that the object is  nearer than the real position \n<$A> This direction please so that everybody can see you \n<$I> Please point it Where is it like that Once please Oh good very good Oh no\n<$A> This is where I see him\n<$I> Okay Now please look it please this way Is it there\n<$H> No it isn't\n<$I> It is here we have pictures of have pictures ofRRR concave convex thick glass block and prism Formation of image on lens If rays come and fall on concave the image  comes up down like this on picture uh while on concave no image form In glass block some of rays few weak  rays reflect strong rays passing through The uh prisms they are they are penetrate and the uh colour are seen\n<$J> When uh we have a point source of light and uh from that point we can to have want to If we have a bulb we can find that the light rays are coming from the bulb and they find uh some direction Now at that direction we say they diverge from the point uh The rays are diverging They are coming from the point and find various uh directions so we say they diverge Now coming to the point of conversion We reverse the rays let us say for example the rays which are coming from certain point or source and coming to the to the concave lens let us say concave mirror they reflect back Now the reflected rays seem to come at a point after the reflection so the coming at a point we say they converge\n<$K> is with all these liquids dissolve all materials provided that is I mean salt sugar salt liquids are used\n<$L> There are visible liquids and invisible liquids\n<$J> In fact what we did we tried to find uh what liquid is denser than the other so we took the liquids randomly uh First of all we took uh some water we put it and then we took some milk we put it we found that uh milk go down then the water was lighter Then we took honey we put on top we found that honey go down pushes up milk and water and so we continued until we found we finished all liquids Then we found that the residues are as follows At the bottom there's honey then follows milk then after milk there is a mixture of tap water distilled water and I think that there was another liquid which was uh coconut juice uh We took this position\n<$M> I have two questions First what do you mean by the pungent smell B you said that alcohol is bitter Did you test it or did you give the answer from your uh your experience\n<$J> We tested by means of uh ordinary test organs that is tongue and Daudu tested\n<$N> From my experience that we are playing with them we are working with them and we have never seen hurt some hurt or any dangerous things that has happened before so we take it for granted that they are not dangerous In case of testing and not drinking \n<$B> For this particular exercise we are all learners and we think with them all we have identified so we know which is which and we know that we can taste them safely But if you are to perform this same activity with children you have to be more careful The choice of materials will matter a lot when you are working with different groups of people For example if you are working with children you wouldn't have uh acid as acid or alkali things like sodium hydroxide or nitric oxide things like that because kids are liable to taste anything placed in front of them So maybe you could choose things like uh lemon juice uh orange juice milk things which are safe Thank you Mr Chairman \n<$L> When you meet the materials you come to notice that there are certain materials which are magnetic and some of the materials are not magnetic\n<$L> In this experiment magnets separate iron filing from the mixture\n<$L> We took a battery wire and a nail We coiled a nail by \n<$L> that electricity can be used to make a magnet and the paper \n<$L> A magnet had brought close to the nail and it was attracted After that the nail become induced and attract razor blade and the razor blade also were induced and then attract before <O/> After suspending the magnet we observed that they formed a very long chain and from this conclusion from that we observed that magnetic materials magnetic material uh the source of magnet passed through magnetic material\n<$E> We bring a magnet that is a side of a magnet to a side of another magnet First we see uh we saw that one magnet attracted to another magnet and diagram two as it's shown in on the paper the magnet shows to repel that is this side uh turn to the opposite and the uh the side here turn into this way We conclude that friend side attract and then enemy repel here", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL',

{'text': "<$A> Now in this session we are going to have something different from presentation from working with materials and from all what we did within the last few or three or four days So in this session we are going to uh summarize look at what we did try to discuss some few issues you are we together and then may be concretise our four days uh stand and working here at Utaani So to start with I'm welcoming the co-ordinator of the uh Science camp and also the director the second director of the uh science and technology department to give us all what he has Welcome Mr Hussein \n<$B> Thank you very much indeed to them they are uh all teachers all of them together All of us here are participants Well before going actually what into what I'm expected to present here first of all I'll have I must say thank you to all participants for good work that we have come out after four or five days of interruptions here between people and people between people and material They have been very active interactions and I'm sure the  units that have been written now will come out as uh documents that will help us in our work later in the classrooms when we go back into our schools and I'm sure that these documents uh The office will work uh extremely hard to have them out as soon as possible so that uh we can use them as uh reference materials to our work in the schools So with that I must say thank you to all participants uh It is actually all of us here who are facilitators it was beyond our expectation that uh uh people would be able to work so hard so intelligently as we have been doing You deserve congratulations all of you\nIt might also that might alsoRRR be that some of us have applied this approach in our day-to-day teaching and also it is possible that some of us have never used this approach in our teaching in the classroom So we tried to give a questionnaire We gave a questionnaire yesterday and uh thirty-three people responded to that questionnaire or in other words evaluation form and I tried to go through the questionnaire and tried to summarize what you yourself commented on what you did in five days So the most interesting question to me and probably to my colleagues also were Do we have a specimen of that questionnaire What did you like about this workshop and what you didn't like about this workshop These were very very important questions to us here as facilitators and they were also very important questions to you yourself participants but unfortunately uh most people didn't respond much in this uh Some people just put dash in that Some people say what you did like about this yes and what you didn't like about this workshop no That doesn't tell us anything or we have to investigate into that We have to do more inquiries into those answers Actually they couldn't help us much in getting a feedback from you actually Those were very important very crucial questions to you that we were expecting you to respond But however some gave their responses and I'm quite happy to read them before you and the first question what did you like about the workshop I translated that question into another form why we need inquiry Why we need inquiry approach It is almost synonymous to that why what did you like about this workshop Definitely you will point out a number of issues a number of things that interested you while you were in this workshop beside those of meals tea break and other things jokes that were highlighted during the presentations during the discussions during the workshop So the first they are the main source of inquiry approach All those that said you liked them definitely they are the good side of the inquiry approach And in other words we can say those are the merits of the inquiry approach So listen to your response on the inquiry approach What did you say about it What are the good sides of the inquiry approach You say one it facilitates exchange of materials ideas This is what you have said It facilitates exchange of ideas and materials and that is very true We have been exchanging ideas in the groups while doing activities and also during presentations we have been all the time we have been most of the time exchanging ideas and material between ourselves as learners because we are all learners You said that learners become creative <O_><O/> and actually you were very very creative You were designing You were devising all sorts of methods ways and means to solve problems For instance today here this morning these people demonstrated to us how they could measure the size of the image to the size of the object That is creativity Maybe some of us we didn't know before how actually to measure that but there is just a simple method using ruler and pencil to measure the size of the image and the size of the object That is clear Then they said students <O_><O/> Of course as you have said that syllabus has to be consider they are very long and I think they have been So actually of course when you go back to your schools you won't teach you won't select topics from nowhere You will be selecting topics from your syllabus So at least we are happy that you know this that you will have to consider your syllabus so we are in a very good position Another thing is arrange participants on subject-based groups but very few commented on this I think only one or two Arrange participants on subject-based groups Well actually one of the tricks of the inquiry approach is to facilitate learning between the learners You as a facilitator the teacher you have to facilitate learning between the groups so for instance here in this workshop we say okay you sit as biology teachers you this group as physics teacher this group as maths teacher So the biology teacher has given light the topic light I think it won't have been appropriate actually in giving <O_><O/> But the way you were you were sharing experiences One who knows gives his experience or her experience or that is shared to those who maybe didn't have that idea You discuss round that idea So the sharing of experience is very vital in the inquiry method and <O_><O/> I just want just wantRRR good readers from Pemba We have more time and less time \n<$C> Okay thank you for the conversation I at the same time disagree I agree that much time has been consumed as I said before at the initial stage the stage when you are prepared the stage when you are learning how to use the inquiry approach but once you are familiar with the approach and you already know what you want to do then time consumption becomes very much excess That is one side of this point The other side of this point I'm sure we as teachers we have an examination and syllabus uh disease I call it call itRRR a syndrome The syllabus syndrome it is an examination syndrome and therefore our languages will cover the syllabus to meet the examination requirement demands And with that syndrome in mind that is why we are rushing We are rushing We are running after the topics the topic without bearing in mind whether our kids understand or not whether you are imparting a true and an appropriate knowledge or not whether what you are doing is has any kind of application to the future life of your students You don't bear in mind You are You say in your mind that  it's none of my business whether they understand or not I'm just starting to finish the syllabus There is one saying and I got this when I was in Nigeria first year first time One of the professors said he was trying to demonstrate and I'm standing up to demonstrate if I can help He was trying to demonstrate Do you know what you mean by covering the syllabus and we said this is covering the syllabus When you cover the syllabus what do you mean You close it and so no one can see what is the syllabus You are covering the syllabus and so that nobody can see and he said and I quote that let us keep the syllabus open so that everybody can see what is in the syllabus What do you mean by seeing what is in the syllabus Teaching with the aim of making our students understand what we are teaching what you are teaching and if I can quote professor He also gave a very good example of holding a young child the two arms getting him to stand on his feet and once you leave the arms of the child what will happen He will fall down That is what we are doing We are rushing for having the examination our students cram whatever you give them They reproduce during the examinations \n<$D> Dear teacher have you attended any science workshop before\n<$E> On my part I have attended have attended two timesRRR in eighteen eighty-nine as well as in nineteen ninety-two \n<$F> This is my first time to attend this science workshop \n<$G> On my part this is the second time to attend this science workshop At one time it was in eighteen eighty-nine and now it is nineteen ninety-two ninety-three\n<$D> Do you think that this workshop is useful to you and the society in general\n<$E> On my own behalf I think that this workshop is very useful to the student as well as to the society because it makes the student or one who this method learns by observing the specimen given learn how to raise  questions as well as planning how to experiment the experiment then experimenting In doing so he learns by creating direct experience and skill from the specimen provided \n<$D> How\n<$E> By doing such experiments by himself He learns by creating direct experience from the experiment he is performing or he is experimenting \n<$D> Do you have any suggestions on the improvement of the science workshop in the future\n<$F> uh yes I have suggestions First of all science workshop should be carried at least twice a year and instead of having one zone in one region we should sub-divide one region into areas For example in this North Pemba region we should have at least two zones whereby the workshop to be conducted Second instead of just assembling secondary schoolteachers we also try to also include primary schoolteachers because also science begins at the primary level\n<$D> Is the approach applicable to your students\n<$F> Yes this approach is very applicable to students Though it has some defects on it but by learning the learner gets a permanent learning Since he is doing the experiment by himself he is learning how to observe he is trying to formulate or to frame out the question how to frame a good question so he is learning and he is getting a very permanent uh learning and what he  does or what he does or what she does stays for long time in his mind Though it has some difficulties For example the teacher or the conductor of the experiment sometimes who he has to have a good financial strength or financial constraint though the method is taking a longer time as well as in our class we have a dense population so in order to do such the teacher has to look forward on these three problems Then he can do it but it's very applicable and it is a very good approach \n<$D> What do you comment on the inquiry approach\n<$E> Science is a process and science is also a progress meaning we have to leave out the old traditional method and try to follow the modern method One of the modern  methods the discovery of better right the inquiry method This should be conducted in schools first of all as Mr Khamis said it's makes learning permanent and also the modern way of teaching is to make pupils or students participate in the lesson So inquiry method welcomes students to take part in the lesson So they do things by themselves uh When doing things by themselves it takes longer time to forget than just traditional  method of just chalk and talk on the blackboard Students or pupils can cram the facts and they can take them to the examination and pass but the examination is over and the facts are also over The inquiry method can substitute the old method\n<$D> What other approach do you know to science teaching\n<$G> Okay well in science teaching the other methods in science teaching are lecture methods and project methods \n<$D> Do you have any other comments\n<$G> Okay to contribute more comments I request the facilitators to organise visits to different schools that have attended this sort of this short course to see how far this inquiry approach is being applied by the science teachers and where they come across any problem or difficulties they deserve to give a helping hands to motivate and encourage the science teachers This will make room for more science teacher to adopt this modern approach of science teaching in both primary as well as in secondary schools", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '9aa05eb4-6a8f-4322-9f63-0be8a9784743', 'added':

{'text': "<$E> This side and this side when you bring near them each other they attract That means they are friend side but you turn other magnet the other side of magnet and bring near the past side of other magnet it turn so that it say this is enemy side\n<$A> The congratulation that I want to give them is they noted that uh the magnet have got side that attract each other and they called these sides friends and they noted that they have sides that do not attract each other they repel and they call these enemy That is a very nice observation That is a very nice report\n<$A> grouping leaves according to samples\n<$O> We took a thin leaf of cognate and keep under the microscope and looked carefully We crushed\n<$D> to put the piece of leaf in the test tube quarter filling with water then heat and observe\n<$B> The colour of benedict solution change \n<$G> Let us start our presentation\n<$J> All our leaves which were observed each one and the result we have got three groups Group one we have seen that there are some leaves that have smooth margin type Group two we have noticed that there are some leaves have margin like this We have given a name zigzag margin and the last one or the last group or the third group has no margin So here we have drawn a diagram to show groups and activity number there we need again all leaves and observe from their stalks and the result was we have seen the leaves divided into two groups There are some leaves have leaves stalks and others have not For example a diagram shown these are the leaves having leaves stalk and one among those was not bear leaf stalk like this one and we also do more observation from leaf stalk and we have seen that some of the stalk are slender and look like sponge However uh another part leaf base and parts were having some holes inside That is hole When you say leaf with no margin There is no margin Also if you observe <ea/>Mvinja have no edge like others \n<$E> Only one drawing is what you have labelled a leaf stalk What you have labelled are those leaf stalks\n<$J> Yes leaf stalk and leaf base\n<$E> Yes this is a leaf base and this is a leaf stalk\n<$B> And uh some papers and some other materials are back there so the problem is to find out all you can about the features that are there\n<<$O> questions were what the materials are provided Number two What are the properties of materials provided Number three What are the dimension of the different shape Number four What are the sizes of angle of different shape Five What are the lengths of different shape and six I'm sorry here there was a slip of pen It should read What other shapes can be obtained from the given shape Number seven Can we make congruent figure from the given shape Number eight Can we make similar shape from the given shapes So we were supposed to answer question number six What other shapes can be obtained from the given shape Here was the question number six We have <O/> and pentagon by using a triangle and a square That is one shape which we form\n<$?> Okay we can confirm\n<$O> It is known a pentagon because it has got five sides Another shape which we could have obtained from other shapes is we have use we have make a partial structure From this we use one hexagonal shape structure with six triangles One hexagon with six triangles shape and a star Another shape was we use four square four squares such as this one this one one two three four and then we use four rhombus two rhombus and two triangles and two trapezium We obtain a twelve-sided figure which the name of it which we couldn't get it only the name of a twelve-sided figure\n<$?> make further investigation\n<$O> Further investigation okay Another figure which we have obtain or another shape which we have obtain is a pentagon using a square between two triangles one square between two triangle This is one triangle and this is one triangle and this is a square Another figure which we obtain is an octagon We arrange four trapezium These are trapeziums and four triangle and a square We end up with an octagon an eight-sided shape Another one was a decagon or a ten-sided figure by using four parallelograms two square two rhombus and one trapezium and one triangle we remain up with a decagon The last one we do was a hectagon an eight-sided figure by arranging three triangle \n<$?> Seven\n<$O> How many Seven-sided figure by arranging three triangles two parallelograms and a square We get a seven-sided figure which is known as hectagon and that is all\n<$A> materials provided is pawpaw baobao fruits orange grapes tomatoes uh the given fruits eaten by man\n<$D> By using litmus paper blue and red identify the this is an activity identify the acidity and the alkalinity of a fruit We get many fruits are acidic\n<$E> pawpaw baobaob fruits orange grapes tomatoes We squeeze the juice of each fruit and the juice of each fruit is added to the benedict solution in a test tube and then heated\n<$O> Time for presentation uh I hope uh What we understand is that each group has given some part of the presentation in order to overcome the repetition\n<$P> Our topic is fruit uh material provided pawpaw tomato orange coconut peas lime banana leech grapes baobaob fruit are the fruits provided in each group Number three All fruits provided have some the same internal structure Number four Do all fruits have the same taste Number five What will be what will happen when given fruit solution tested with A litmus paper B universal indicator C milo reagent D will answer question number three and question number four Question number three is do all fruits provided have the same internal structure Now we are talking about internal structure of fruits which must be first of all a cutting and observing the internal structure of the fruit provided Now in our observation we know uh we see fruits have the same internal structure e g orange and lime tomato and <ea/>tunguja uh These fruit have the same internal structure like this This is orange and this is lime Inside contains seed <eh> and softer uh like this They divided into layers like that and <ea/>tunguja uh and lime also Now tomato and <ea/>tunguja also the same We get seed many seeds internal and <ea/>tunguja also and some fruits are different in their internal structure e g pawpaw The internal structure is if you cut the pawpaw we can see like this This is internal structure very soft This is uh part This is external part Now the internal structures of peas internal structureRRR of peas <eh> like that There is seeds internal like this and then the internal structure of banana There is some seeds inside and baobaob fruits like this There is a seed\n<$B> Now we are inviting questions additions or comments uh anything\n<$A> While describing something for instance the position when we mean when we say the seeds are at the centre What do we mean by the seeds are at the centre and how are how they are arranged at that centre at that particular centre Are they arranged longitudinally or things of that sort The way they observe to cut they cut the orange across section it definitely shows they are at the centre but only at a point and actually they are located longitudinally along the axis so this is a sort of observation that we have to make while observing the materials We have to be specific in describing how the thing is rather than at the centre\n<$Q> Right and I emphasize that if you want to see the arrangement of a seed you must specify which ways of cutting so you can see the arrangement of seeds cutting longitudinally Also you can see another arrangement of seeds when you cut vertically So you don't keep it as you say just arrangement of seeds In what position of cutting is important\n<$R> My colleague  says the  seeds are concentrated more at the centre. Actually he means that the seeds are not found at the centre because when we say concentrated we mean that the seeds they may be at the centre and others will be a little bit away from the centre That is why he refer concentrated because most of the seeds they are found at that region They are not at the centre They are found in that region meaning that region and if you want to prove that we can cut an orange in any direction you will notice that most of the seeds are very near at the centre They are concentrated very near to the centre That is my point \n<$S> Okay introduction first The materials are selected to be given the participant or say the students The type of material given will depend upon the level of the students or participants or however So the reagents the food test reagents were given to the teachers because we assume that teachers know about the food tests and the litmus papers were given because we guess that was to be given  to Form One students Form Two students Form Four students different available materials will be given For example if the material is to be conducted in Form One we shall <O/> these for Form One students first there should be another one activity beforehand for the use of the reagents for example different food substances will be given to students and they were allowed to play with reagents in each food reagent As a result the teacher then will tell or the if you read on the reagent on to this type of food It  means this type of food is starch or this is protein and something like this So you have to consider about the materials given to the students The level of the the<_/> students of the learners will lead to the choice of material to be presented during their activities So we should not quarrel\n<$F> underestimate the students because they can do something which you don't know So then we decide to give the things to the student we should understand uh I say this they want to they can do the wonderful things so let them do it And you are the teacher You have to live after this <O/> over but under inquiry approach we have to think very carefully on actually what we want to see and that can be facilitated by the question When you frame good questions then it is much easier for you to do investigations and when you frame bad questions then it is very difficult for you to make investigations What I mean here we have good questions and we have bad questions you see So we have to be very conscious on the questions that we have to frame so as to lead us into observation WE have to be very careful uh And that also will be the same  for the students whom you are going to teach They will be framing questions It is better that when they are framing their questions you go around the groups and help them to modify those questions Definitely they must have an idea that they want to observe but it might be very difficult for them to frame a good question a good observable question so you have to go round them and help them reframe their questions so that they will be given to investigation", 'subdomain': 'EAST_AFRICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b5b5b2fd-d5fb-4e88-b1e2-d97d0f807b77', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:45:01.246376+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9709645509719849, 'non_english_score': 0.029035449028015137}
