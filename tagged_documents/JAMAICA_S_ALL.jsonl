{'text': "<$A>  an information policy\n\n<$B>  And a language policy\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n Uhm you can see policy in two ways right\n such\n\nas<,> the one that was developed a couple of years ago for science and\n\ntechnology where you have a booklet called Policy on Science and\n\nTechnology<,> or you can understand it also in a way as uhm<,,>\n\nunderstandings<,> right on the basis of which<,> well in this\n\ncase the media<,> have operated and so on\n in\n\nJamaica<,> right\n The government would take a decision on something as far as\n\ngovernment policy is concerned right\n The rest of the media also evolve and do things that become\n\npolicy<,> you see<,>\n\n when we were\n\nhaving colour television a decision had to be taken whether it should be the\n\n  PAL system or the N T S C system<,>\n that became\n\ngovernment policy\n\n\nthe<,,> uhm regional stations that belonged to J B C\n That was another reflection of policy\n been these\n\nde facto<,,> uhm things which constitute the policy of the broadcasting\n\ncommission and its rule and all of that right <unclear> a-few-\n\nwords</unclear><,,>\n eighty-\n\nnine ninety that a more formalized approach should be taken by the government\n\nin information and communication policy which now involves the media and so\n\non would involve the media\n is now being prepared\n\n you know as to\n\nwhen it would come out and become<,> formal<,> and in fact take\n\neffect\n formalized\n\nand made coherent and    bring\n\ntogether all the different things that have existed as de facto\n\npolicies\n\n there\n\nis let me put it this way  there is    language<,> which is\n\nEnglish<,>\n\n\n\nassumes that it is English that they talking about when they talk\n\nabout the media\n I think that is how they grew up\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  The B B C\n\n<$A>  Well they were the people who advised us when we were started\n\nout on the radio and so on\n It was some of the same people who started J B C in nineteen\n\nsixty-two<,,>\n So there's that\n don't think people thought of I\n\ndon't think<,> we have thought about it enough\n is being prepared\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  It is not as far as I know it's not an issue at all\n\nright<,>\n aspect of language though which has come into\n\nplay<,> uhm<,,> and that is<,> not the Jamaican language now but<,> the\n\nimportance of Jamaican with other languages   Jamaican and other\n\n  languages to facilitate communication\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$A> \n\nthat  that's an area of interest\n there has been discussion on that\n\n<$B>  Mhm\n\n<$A>  For example in this ministry\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n two weeks ago there was a regional conference of\n\ninformation ministers and Maxine Henry-Wilson who is minister of State\n\nCare<,,> in her opening<,>    speech<,> made\n\nthe point that<,> the cultures in the region probably need to consider making\n\na second language<,> compulsory<,> properly as a language\n go to school and you learn Spanish\n\nand you know what Spanish is\n to\n\nthe level that you can talk with somebody who comes from the Dominican \n\n Republic\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n And the rest have the third language by itself\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B>  Because Creole is the first\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$B> \n\na-few-words</unclear>\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B> \n No but I am saying\n\n<$A> \n\nwhole<,> nomenclature the whole thing of uhm<,> second language\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B> \n Yes yeah\n\n\n who would talk about<,> Creole which is what you call it as  a\n\nfact I don't know   what's that<,,> uhm is also a\n\nlanguage<,>\n And I have been following some of the discussions earlier and not\n\nso much now<,> about<,> why it is a language is syntax and the  \n\nvocabulary and so many other things<,>\n And all a lot there may be\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Stokes then\n\nyou know she was an editor of  Nelson a time wrote to say how we are\n\nwhatever about our language\n in\n\nthe middle page of the Sunday Gleaner<,>\n Trying to say well I mean too many people have said it over the\n\nyears you know but nobody listens you know trying to say that I mean people\n\nneed to sort of get themselves aquainted with what the arguments are about\n\nthe language and so on   and not just<,> perpetuate this myth\n\nthat we don't have any language\n You know what I mean\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  No it's there and a lot of work has been done on this\n I know\n I mean dictionaries\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$B>  At least one\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  about\n\nteaching English like they would teach a second language which is a bit\n\ndifferent yeah\n knowing a\n\nlanguage which is not English\n they need to understand it as a second\n\nlanguage   so as to be able to learn it in school\n\n the side of acknowledging this I\n\nmean   that is we have to develop this thing  \n\n<unclear> a-few-words</unclear> as part of the culture\n me

an area of interest that is\n\nevolving<,>\n you certainly ask\n\nme well ahead with this kind of situation\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  what the\n\npolicy well I suspected as I told you that uhm<,> much had not been thought\n\nabout it\n Because people still in their mind have the idea that English is\n\nour first language    and our only language and\n\ntherefore there would be no need to have    a language policy\n Because if English is the official language and the only\n\nlanguage<,> then<,> why would you need to write it in\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  yes\n\n<$A>  So that had been my suspicion\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n at\n\na<,,>  at  <,,>  a<,> political level\n\nabout this thing see\n us say you spoke to\n\nthem at the Ministry of Education right\n\n<$A>  Yes I understand\n\n<$B> \n\naccept<,> at that level the minister right<,> let alone the\n\ncivil servants   and the teachers and all of them right<,,>\n\nwould have to accept and promote the thing in the way they did with the\n\nCaribbean studies in schools<,> right that this thing<,> has to\n\nnow happen right\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mark you it's happening you know that's the point that I mean\n\n<$B>  what I had why this whole thing came up is\n\nthat<,> as I said I was listening to the news<,> and noticing how frequently\n\n   the ordinary man came on in a\n\nclip<,>\n up\n\nabout Radio Central<,> and the fact that it didn't seem to have got much\n\nsupport<,> and no fundings so that when U S A money ran out it collapsed\n But then it seems to me that this sort of thing where actually is\n\nbecoming<,> the norm<,> whether it's policy or not<,> it's a\n\nbetter way to get things done<,>   you know\n If people just keep introducing the clips after a while people\n\njust accept that you must hear Creole voices on the news or in these formal\n\nprogrammes\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  these de\n\nfacto<,> principles<,> right<,> that have emerged\n you\n\ncould say that  <- > there<,>  there

than the Pidgin English\n\n<$B>  You are out of your mind\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  right\n\n<$A>  now\n It\'s not well developed because\n\n<$B>  down as your Pidgin English does\n\nour patois goes up\n\n<$A> \n Listen to the analogy\n\n<$B>  Our patois is not hand down coming down from the\n\nEnglish-speaking people accepting if we going communicate with these people\n\nwe have to speak in this kind of broken Pidgin kind of English to them\n is going up where people up there have\n\nto say boy we\'re gonna speak to them we have to figure out how to write what\n\nthey are saying<,> right\n And to this day they have not been able because they\'re trapped in\n\ntheir view like you are that this is    a poor\n\nform of English<,> when what it is in fact is    a\n\nindigenous attempt a development of a language of its own<,> with its own\n\norigins its own grammar its own vocabulary   right okay\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  I\'m trying to say to you Pidgin English\n\nhas uniformity\n So you go right across thirty-two states\n\n<$B>  Because it has been handed down it will have uniformity don\'t\n\nyou understand what I\'m   saying to you Harvey\n right\n what\n\nare the rules of Pidgin English\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  is not developed\n\n<$B>  Oh our patois is far more well developed\n\n<$A>  that why\n\nis it then\n\n<$B>  is there a\n\nlanguage that    is as\n\ndescriptive as our patois\n Is there anything that has ever been described to you in your\n\nchildhood or your adulthood here in Jamaica your Jamaican experience in\n\npatois that is not crystal-clear<,> this definition\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B>  right\n\n<$A>  Here\'s my question\n\n<$B>  fulfills all the requirements\n\nexcept the difficulty in putting it in a grammatically correct or\n\nphonetically uhm acceptable format\n\n<$A>  Here\'s my problem\n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$A>  Produce five sentences and give it to Edward Baugh give it to\n\nCarolyn  <- > Cooper give it to five different\n\npeople\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  Yes that is true\n\n<$B>  Because it\'s not a written language\n\n<$C>  That is true\n\n<$B>  Because it\'s not a written language because\n\n<$A>  Every language is written\n\n<$C>  That is true five different sentences\n\n<$B> \n\n You back up one second\n You back up one second\n in\n\nSouth America<,> it\'s still in the Amazon    their\n\nlanguage is a written language<,> or uh no they don\'t have a language because\n\nit\'s not written\n\n<$A>  five versions of the same\n\nlanguage\n\n<$B>  excuse me because a language is\n\nnot written does not define it as a non-language\n Because you are unable to write down their language you are then\n\ndefining it as a non-language\n a kind of bloody arrogance\n\nman\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A>  what I\'m saying to you\n\n<$B>  You\'re saying because these people don\'t have a written\n\nlanguage they don\'t have a language at all<,> yeah\n\n<$A>  I\'m saying to you\n\n<$B>  They have been surviving for centuries talking to each other\n\nand understanding what they\'re dealing with and you are saying they don\'t\n\nhave a language\n\n<$A>  But I\'m saying when it comes to writing it\n\n<$B>  Why is that the key corner stone\n It\'s only important to you\n It was never important to them\n\n<$A>  Because when you want to communicate\n\n<$B>  No you want to communicate with them you learn their language\n Why is it that when you want them to communicate with you they\n\nmust abandon their language and learn yours\n\n<$A>  No my point is\n\n<$B>  No that is what you all do\n You go in there and you tell the people\n right\n In order to communicate you must learn my language because you\n\nhave a non-language\n It is not written and therefore it\'s not important\n So I will learn enough of it to teach you mine and that\'s all I\'m\n\ninterested in enough of your language to teach you mine\n So you will then speak and write in my language and forget your\n\nown because it\'s a non- language\n\n<$A>  No but there comes a day\n\n<$B>  give me\n\na break\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Give me a break give me a break give me a break\n\n<$A>  Now hold on\n if she came and she took up two novels\n\nwritten in patois or three novels written in patois the language is difficult\n\nthe spellings are different\n\n<$B>  Yes\n So if it was written in Sanskrit\n\n<$A>  The spellings are also different\n\n<$B> \n\nbut  but alphabet\n eh\n had to learn\n\nit<,> right\n\n<$A>  no linguist but I would\n\nimagine that if I was looking at the language I would like to see some\n\nuniformity so that if   I go from Kingston\n\n<$B>  people don\'t have the\n\nuniformity\n\n<$A>  But it\'s not reflected\n You have just said to me that when Carolyn Cooper writes something\n\n  I don\'t know what she\'s saying\n\n<$B>  it\'s not\n\nreflected in the individuals that   learn it  \n\n the learning individuals who are using their\n\nEnglish-language base to write

money and whatever\n And I used to say to them you know when you graduate you won't\n\ncome back to Jamaica\n And they would all you know especially the first year oh no no\n\nI'm going home\n\n<$B>  I'm going home\n Yeah\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  And by the third year trust me they don't want to come back\n\nhere for a vacation\n And you are sending a ticket to them I mean you are paying a\n\nticket for them to come home\n But I've seen those changes\n What I find as to planning a lot of Jamaicans come up there and\n\nthey select subjects in college that they can't get a job in when they\n\ngraduate\n A lot of them come up there to do agriculture\n Try to get a job afterwards in agriculture\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  They can't\n Interior decorating\n\n<$B>  you\n\ngo for the soft

 Yeah\n But then the problem is that so many people are doing exactly the\n\nright degree yeah\n It's like M B As\n M B As are now a dime a dozen\n\n<$A>  He was getting something like eight dollars

Unless you want to come home and get back and get into the\n\nindustry in   the Caribbean right\n as Tony said most of them after three years don't\n\nwant to come home right\n So you go there alright yes but the degree you're doing in\n\ntourism is gonna place you very nicely you know in our system here\n But then after three years you decide even you have a new circle\n\nof friends and everything

unquote " cool job"   cos\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A> \n\ngives me some amount of flexibility in terms of I mean you will have pressing\n\ndeadlines and you know things to do where you probably have to stay back and\n\nget them done\n But at the same time it\'s not a case where you have somebody\n\nconstantly breathing down    your back you know to\n\nget things done like \n I need this now\n\n\n\nit\'s not  it\'s not something that is very frequent\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  this is\n\nlike  this is like uh one of the most laid back institutions\n\nyou have seen\n I mean laid back in terms of the social

\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\nimpression at the party\n\n<$A>  Yeah my so many women not to\n you know women once you have an\n\nenvironment with too many women then they always tend to have little glitches\n\nthere because they always I don\'t know I don\'t know what it is\n\nseriously I don\'t know they just seems to just despise each other and you\n\nknow always like bad-talking each other but I mean  , the guys\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A> \n\n  but it\'s mainly guys yeah\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  one\n\nof the main reasons too\n I don\'t know I\'m just saying this of course this is my personal\n\nopinion   that uh\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$B>  I trust I believe him\n It\'s like that\n\n<$A>  think that\'s one of the main\n\nreason why    they chose to hire more guys\n And not only that but also a lot of this stuff that is to be done\n\nI think    it requires some sort of uh<,> manpower\n\nand you\'d more get that from a guy than a woman I mean you\n\nwouldn\'t want to for example    if   like you\n\nwere handling\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  Manpower as in like manual strength labour\n\n\nclimb up on something    to fix something\n\nfor example or you need to pull a cylinder or lift some heavy equipment I\n\nmean\n I think\n\na guy is more suitable for that type of job\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  No not everybody\n But at some point in time it requires that for even I mean for\n\nexample field trips because we<,,> basically    to\n\nget all this work done I mean in the initial stages the base uhm aspect of\n\nthe whole<,> sample collection is that you have to go out there and you have\n\nto do all the manual work which entails driving all that way to the rural\n\narea digging up the soil in all these rugged terrains using all the <unclear>\n\nword</unclear> like probably going about thirty feet down to collect the soil\n\nsample which entails some level of not some level a lot of\n\nmanual strength right\n\n\nif  if you\'re a person that\'s accustomed to some level of\n\nfinesse then this definitely won\'t suit you\n Cos then you\'ll have insects mosquitoes and all these things\n\nbiting you out there and you know the heat the sweat dirt and you know I mean\n\nI   can almost\n\n\n<$Z> \n people here who just do research\n\nwho are not responsible for that kind of thing\n\n<$A>  No well actually I mean based upon your job most of the\n\npeople who are uhm works in the lab whether it be the scientists or just like\n\nstraight technicians they have to go to field at some point in time\n Before all these people got hired I had to do it\n hired to do it but\n\nI had to do it\n is\n\n<unclear> word</unclear> at some point in time\n You know if you\'re called upon to do what you\'d probably call odd\n\nchores you know you should be able to just fit in without you know having to\n\nbe questioning whether or not you should do this or you\'re hired to be doing\n\nthis kind of thing\n So I mean taking all of that into account I guess women can go on\n\nthese fields trips because it\'s not a case that they can\'t manage\n But I think based upon what I\'ve seen from past experience that\n\nthe men tend to be more<,> efficient in their sample collection technique\n\nthan   uhm a team\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A> \n\nit  it seems to be more efficient    it seems to be a lot more productive when you have\n\nlike a male dominated field team right\n can handle\n\nthis kind of thing and they don\'t really make a big fuss out of it you know\n\nso\n want to sound like a\n\nchauvinist pig or anything but you know or some big you know\n\nsexist you know male chauvinist but I mean it\'s just the truth\n It\'s just the truth\n Believe that\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$Z> \n parties\n\na little bit boring   doesn\'t it\n\n<$A> \n\nlime with a bunch\n" is a Trinidadian word\n\nthat I use a lot\n It means " party" right you\'re going to have a\n\nlittle party you have a little  lime anyway\n yeah with a bunch of\n\nguys<,> is better\n because guys tend to be a lot more\n\ninnovative unlike women\n Women are more on the conservative side\n They\'ll sit they\'ll talk but guys will more open up to you<\n#>They will open up to you and    I think they\n\nare a very hilarious bunch especially when they start drinking you\n\nknow\n They tell you all kind of things that you never asked them for you\n\nknow\n So I mean\n\n<$C>  Hi\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  Oh there is William\n\n\n<$B>  the hilarious\n\nbunch\n\n<$A>  That\'s another one of them yes\n staff members that\n\nwe have   here\n\n<$Z> \n come to change the atmosphere here a little bit\n\nbecause I hear that you don\'t have women here so\n\n<$C>  Nice meeting you\n\n<$A> \n\nthe reason why there are not so many women here has something to do\n\nwith the director in general cos he\'s the person who\'s in charge of hiring\n\neverybody so\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  Uhm Professor Lalor yeah\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  I mean he is basically the head person in charges of\n I guess all the hiring and firing is basically done by him and I\n\nmean if he deems it fit to hire mainly guys I guess he must have some reason\n\nwhy he    chosethat\n\n Maybe at some point in time if you have the time you probably\n\ncould ask him why and then for sure he probably could give you the real\n\nreason why\n\n<$Z> \n\n\nkind of research that you do here\n I mean not many women study I mean I don\'t know what it\'s like\n\nhere but uhm as far as I know generally    not many\n\nwomen study physics and the kind of   <unclear> word</unclear>\n\n   I don\'t know what it\'s like here\n\n<$A>  the the science the\n\nscience  the science faculties tend to be\n\npredominantly<,> dominated    by guys  \n\n but I mean from a overall point of view there are more women in\n\nthe university\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  I think true\n\nin the Caribbean\n But I think it as I say I think the reason why this is so is that\n\nfrom a early age  <- > guys  guys are taught that they are\n\nthe providers\n So guys will leave school and go straight into a job start\n\nworking cos you see a guy picks up a girl\n She wants a guy who\'s quote unquote as they call it can offer\n\nsecurity\n It\'s not security it\'s just money\n just a flashy name they\n\nhave for money to make it sound not so bad<,> you know\n So uhm and as I said because I mean from early you are taught as\n\na guy that you know    you are the provider<,>\n\nyou know although mind you it should be a fifty fifty thing where if you have\n\na girlfriend then pretty much one hand feeds the other so you both pretty\n\nmuch should share in whatever it is\n I guess that\'s one of the main reasons that guys you\n\nknow wanting  <- > to  to be providers wanting to have\n\nmoney you know to meet their needs will more just go through the basic\n\nschooling you know primary tertiary and then pretty much move on to a job<,>\n\nand<,> I mean while the women    will go through\n\nthe whole school system and then move    on to uhm\n\nuniversities and then they\'ll come out being quote unquote a bit more\n\neducated\n\n<$Z> \n But then on the staff you don\'t have so many women I\'m not sure\n\n  but I had this impression\n\n<$A>  well the thing is that the thing is\n\nthis I mean   <- > it it  it all depends upon the\n\ninstitution itself\n It just depends on for example like the centre now which is uh\n\nheavy research facility where they uh specialize in a lot of\n\nmultidisciplinary stuff maybe the type of research that they\'re doing    it more suits them to hire more men than women\n So uh maybe in another institution where it\'s more business\n\noriented then maybe they\'ll hire more women I\'m not sure\n It\'s just maybe you know so\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  Well that\'s true but I mean as I said it just differs like\n\nif you look into banks for example you tend to see a lot more women in the\n\n  banks right\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  I don\'t know if\n\nit has anything to do with the fact that they are the fairer sex and they\n\nlook better\n\n\nthan a guy you know some guy cashing money giving to you\n just an image\n\nthing\n I don\'t know maybe maybe not\n it\'s like I don\'t know if you see\n\ntwo persons and they\'re both sales clerk a guy and a girl some beautiful\n\nwoman    you\'re probably more inclined even\n\nif she\'s selling something that is total crap you\'re probably more inclined\n\nto uhm<,> at least give her a chance you probably buy it try it and you\n\nprobably cuss if it don\'t work', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

collecting\n\nsoils and all of those things and then analysing them\n Alright we have a basic school here that uh children plays but\n\nthe school yard is like  had lead\n came in and put in uhm\n\nthis uh air sampler and    they analysed the dust\n\nand they found lead\n So lead is not good for children you know make them slow learn\n\nand all of those things\n So they came in and help out the children cover paint the place\n\nand all of that\n So the children were grateful for all of that you know and the\n\nschool looking up now looking even better than ever\n them been there it turn to gold you know\n\nyou know like when you take a rusty old thing and then they polish it off and\n\nthen they like  look it that\'s all they did so\n\n<$Z>  \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  and all of\n\nthat so\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  you know\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n\n<$A>  My colleagues now meaning friends and\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  Okay for instance uh a lot of nice people work here man like\n\nJohn

working here in the\n\ncentre\n\n<$A>  keep me\n\nup yeah\n try to I recently I think I\'ve been\n\ncausing them a little problem might be I don\'t know if I\'m up in trouble at\n\nhome and more time is like I don\'t turn up for work yeah\n They need me cos my part of the work is like I\'m sample prep so\n\nis me is the one I have to push the work get the work in   that\n\nthey can move\n\n I think I need to polish up that side of the area and get it\n\ngoing smooth again<,>So that\'s what we\'re doing now I\'m\n\ntrying to get <unclear> two-words</unclear> on track for the year

is\n you know\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\nis everything ready\n\n<$A>  Yeah yeah they have softwares for that you know\n the\n\nsoftware so\n And all the banks and all those thing I hear like they say that\n\neverybody should draw their money before they uhm but all you have to do is\n\ntry to just get a statement of all the money you have in the bank and get\n\nthem to sign it and then eh and then the <unclear> several-words</unclear>\n\n eh you don\'t have any money you say  here\'s the\n\nstatement I have it\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$Z> \n be nuclear accident here\n\nbecause of the year two

year tend to be hot\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$Z> \n So we tend to have tea or we have some kind of uhm hot wine and\n\nthings like that and that\'s \n\n<$A>  You drink wine hot\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  wow\n\n<$Z> \n No that\'s a kind of special thing\n and that\'s for\n\nChristmas and because it\'s so cold\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n So that means you get away this year then\n You\'re not going up for Christmas are you\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  going back to the freezer\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  Ah Jamaica is such a nice climate\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  Nice climate\n But in the nights it tend to go get kind of chilly but not\n\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  Okay\n I know that cos you\'re used to like minus something and\n\n<$Z> \n Exactly\n\n\n<$A>  It\'s right through the air only for summer it\'s like hot but\n\nwe have A C so\n\n<$Z> \n So what part of Jamaica is uhm the most beautiful one\n you see I haven\'t travelled\n\nmuch so you have to tell me a bit about Jamaica\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  it\'s hard to tell which place is beautiful\n I just look at Jamaica all of Jamaica the fourteen parishes are\n\nbeautiful but sightseeing like Portland or St James Hanover St Mary<,> a lot\n\nof places well Montego Bay Negril\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  those\n\nplaces are tourist resorts and if you ever spend the time to travel\n\non the edge of Jamaica go around trust me I don\'t think you\'d want to go back\n\nhome\n peaceful\n You just want to have uh the right guide a camera and a lot of\n\nfood or drink and then on your way\n Ah it\'s just nice looks really nice\n do it myself\n\nbut I have to be at work and all of that so\n\n\nmore about Jamaica than I do\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  have to be like\n\nworking to make two ends meet you like you can\'t sit at home in Jamaica here\n\nyou have to be working cos cost of living is like high so you like have to\n\nwork\n If you don\'t work you\'re gonna become a bum and nobody wants to\n\nbe a bum right\n\n\ngonna get up and say  here is dinner for

like they want you to put like\n\nlife into them hand and say like  go and make life you know\n That\'s not how it done\n If you want a work to be done you can\'t look at it here and like\n\nlooking

they did it because his name not\n\non the account\n is so funny\n\nthat it was his original account before we met and my name was added to and\n\nthen in his going around and organising things him add my name again so his\n\nname got kicked off\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  So them must know say a your name\n\n<$C>  my\n\nname is on it twice\n\n<$A>  they thought of\n\nit    obviously\n\n<$C>  No no\n No my branch is okay\n\n<$A>  Yeah but you need to solve it\n\n<$C> ,\n\nbecause according to him and all of the papers and all of  \n\n the uhm titles and so on everything    even\n\nhis mother's stuff

it programme <unclear>\n\nwords</unclear> church and everything cos she was so devastated by it\n And then by the time my grandmother died even though she wasn't so\n\ndevastated she said  cho you go on and do it\n And then I started thinking what happens if my mother dies\n Me know me two brothers are going to be so out of it that them\n\ncan't do  nutten\n So I would be the one who would have to do it to do the funeral\n\narrangements\n,\n I know that eventually I will respond to it but I'm just\n\nthinking that in the interim while you know you have to do all of those\n\npractical things  , <unclear> words</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n I remember about a month before my brother died we were at the\n\nhouse and I said to them\n We had just bought this new house this new family house all of us\n\ncome up and buy house\n So me say boy everybody was saying how broke we were and me say\n\nboy what if somebody should die what would happen who would pay\n And I said to them don't worry if all of you die I can bury you\n You don't have to worry\n And you know I say that I will save the money for all of us in the\n\nevent anything should happen to any of us or all of us you know\n So my sister was like whatever\n Of course my brother died\n Now we always wonder who would have been level-headed in all of\n\nthis\n Let me tell you something\n When them hear say my brother crash nobody

with us for he had cancer so\n\nthey were treating him and Sean sounded very Jamaican because he was in the\n\nhome with my grandfather who  ,  spoke patois\n the\n\nStuart's Auto Sales<,> and so you know  \n\n he had just basically worked many years in a garage\n\nsituation<,> and you know    and\n\nthere were plenty rough edges around him<,> and uhm so\n\nmy brother<,> I mean when we used to go

  there was   \n\nno Creole being spoken at all\n he was a\n\nlawyer<,> and back then it was very different because\n\nuhm by that time you know the university hadn't started disseminating

right cos nobody can understand patois unless you are a\n\n  native Jamaican\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  a lot\n\nof uhm different ways of looking at the issue\n\n\nspeak  teach English as a second

understand English\n helper that's mummy's helper\n\nactually she can't watch news and understand American news<,>\n\nlike\n She told me that once she was like I don't know how you\n\nunderstand that\n cos you\n\nwould think you know    she has basic\n\neducation and whatever and it is supposedly English<,>\n But like what I found and I went to one of the traditional high\n\nschools

It's the same thing that you find at the university campus\n You have people at the tertiary level who are failing U C one\n\ntwenty you know the\n So it's crazy they're you know\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z>

have a better and easier time teaching English better\n\n  as a second language because they say often the English\n\nlanguage teaching is deficient<,,>\n they just go through corrections uh\n\nto talk the patois is bad but they're not actively taught  \n\n what the good English   should be or the Standard English\n\nshould be\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  That's right\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Mhm\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Yeah\n No because they have children struggling to\n\nunderstand<,> you know as it is and you know poorly educated as\n\na result<,>\n also have the problem of\n\nthe teachers themselves not being able to speak English<,>\n\nbecause you know    we just don't really\n education system has\n\ngone they used to have like people from the university with their DipEds the\n\ndiploma in education but now there is\n In a year I could have left high school and gone to a teachers\n\ntraining college<,> and then been a teacher<,>\n not the very highly\n\neducated people

to\n\nuniversity in uhm Wisconsin<,> and any time my\n\nfather is on the phone    with an American he starts\n\nsounding like an American<,>\n If he's on the phone with an Englishman he starts

like me\n live in the southwest of Germany now\n far\n\nnorth<,> I start sounding foreign to them when  around\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> Right\n Oh yeah you're the foreigner\n\n<$Z>  Yeah\n Yeah I think it depends on your personality if you\n\nadapt<,> how far you adapt and at what age you were exposed \n\n  is a   Jamaican\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  they were\n\nmerchants<,> and uhm actually they had

a\n\nbaby<,>\n So everybody else had been kind of raised in Santo Domingo\n\n\nand when grandma was three her father died<,>\n So you know as because her mother was never American at\n\nall<,> like when grandma went to school she couldn't understand\n\nEnglish\n\n\n she was native\n\nnative Spanish speaking<,>\n But my grandfather's family uhm they were in Falmouth Trelawney\n\n  on the north

the other side<,>\n cousins\n\njust got married the other day this one or that one of my seventeen year old\n\ncousins  at once uhm<,> and well pretty much my other cousin I have a\n\ncousin who is a

be\n\nas\n\n\ngoing say my father was very protective    and\n\nyou know he wouldn't allow me to go to parties and stuff but then I can say\n\nmaybe that's what made me up to this point and that's what keep me being safe\n\nand you know not being killed or anything<,> or getting in the\n\nwrong company\n But I think I would be a little less stringent on my children not\n\n  too much but a little less and I think that    I would<,> show more public affection around them which\n\nmy father does not do<,> or like hug them more and tell them I\n\nlove them and stuff   more and all of that instead of just\n\nhaving them know that they know it<,> uhm<,>\n pretty much\n\nthat's it because everything else is okay except for   \n\nthose areas I already touched<,>\n Probably I don't think I

when you and\n\nthem kind of argue and stuff   but the truth of the fact is you\n\njust know deep down that you guys are genuine friends and stuff like that\n be\n\nthere for you and<,> you can be there for them likewise and you know you will\n\nalways remember them no matter what<,> not just people   \n\nwho want to use you because you know you're in a situation where you\n\ncan help them or you know <unclear> words</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nyou have had with friends good and bad\n\n<$B>  Well in high school a lot of bad ones and good ones uhm a lot\n\nof arguments\n You know them always say that with girls you have a lot of\n\narguments and stuff\n Yeah I had a lot of arguments in high school over some really puny\n\nstuff\n But I realised that those were the things that helped our\n\nrelationship to   become stronger and    what's\n\nyour view on the university's uhm cut economy cutting down and uhm\n\nhow much money they distribute around our uhm   on campus<,> right\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n   economics at work   because uhm\n\neverything is getting more expensive you know\n\n And then at we heard that and we who live on hall know that\n\nstudents waste a lot of resources over their water light and  \n\n<unclear> words</unclear> so all of a sudden they you know    them have to deal with the fact say them\n\nhave a lot of bills on them hand and you know they're maintaining it's like\n\n   a mini country they're\n\nmaintaining up here a   mini town so\n I guess in order to make sure that it functions properly they have\n\nto cut back on something to pay off their bills and keep themself  \n\nout of debt\n So I can understand that from an economic point of view but in the\n\nsituation that we are as students you know it's really sad because some of us\n\nreally need those jobs\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mhm\n\n\nhall right so\n What was it like tell me about it you know why you wanted to live\n\non hall and you know has it benefited you has it helped you you know\n\n<$B>  Well I would say that it has benefited me because I really\n\nwanted to live on hall\n I was told by a friend that actually that I need to make sure that\n\nI live on one year before I leave UWI and I really wanted to\n second\n\nsemester with my friend and having tasted that kind of liberation you\n\nknow I really wanted to live on you know<,>\n be\n\nresponsible for yourself\n I mean you have to deal with your own bills and your own expenses\n\nand    you cooking for yourself and  \n\nyou managing your time and everything and it just kind of gives you \n\n<,>  a  it's like a microcosm of what it will be\n\nlike in the real world only in a more protected frame<,>\n So I really think that it's a good experience for everybody and it\n\nhas helped me to be a more independent person you know  \n\n I feel more confident as I can go out there take care of myself\n\nnow\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n on Irvine hall\n\n<$B>  It was good and bad because I wasn't used to having so many\n\nfemales around me who just wanted to know so much about your business and it\n\nwas annoying to tell you the truth because them just want know everything\n If them see a guy come in your room them want know if he your\n\nboyfriend I mean\n\n A your friend that\n\n I mean everybody had a story to tell you about somebody and you\n\nhave to wonder if them  naa tell somebody a story about you\n\ntoo when you tell them your business so\n the block I lived\n\non was really cool because we would always go out together party together \n\n you know<,>  we really had a lot of parties\n\ntogether a lot of bonding we talk a lot and<,> I think that even though\n\neverybody was different    there was still\n\nsomething special about the way that we lived over there\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Uhm how has coming to the University of the West Indies and\n\nexperience a new life how    has it helped you to be   \n\na better individual you know\n How has it benefited you not only academically but socially and you\n\nknow economically and morally and you\n\nknow\n\n<$B>  Yeah well everything to me I guess teaches you something new\n\nuhm\n I think it's both good and bad\n\nI mean\n Well there must be some kind of bad in there you know because\n\nthat's just how life is but generally I think that coming to UWI has prepared\n\nme for the world<,> you know just as you're not just education\n\nnot just by giving me the education that I need but I mean  <- > it's\n\n it's the world    in a\n\nmicrocosm so you I learn how to deal with people  here you look\n\nupon a lot of different people you know   we have students\n\nhere from all over the Caribbean maybe all over the world too and<,> you just\n\nbasically learn to take care of yourself and what you you know you can make\n\nyour mistakes here and some of them you know they're not it's not like\n\nthey're in the wider world where you can't repair it you know\n You get to make the mistake here so when you go out there you don't\n\ndo the same stupidness\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mhm\n UWI doesn't\n\nhave<,> but needs\n\n<$B> \n Yeah I think they're trying a lot and I guess it the fact is that\n\nwe don't have    our economic situation won't allow\n\n   for so many internships as we would\n\nneed<,> you know cos I remember this morning Eddie was telling\n\nme that uhm when the Canadian students leave university they have choice \n\n  in which jobs they want cos people come\n\nrecruiting them before they   even finish them degree like at\n\nthe stage that we're at now them start recruit them already and    them can choose which job them want but we don't have\n\nthat kind of luxury so you know   we\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  I no well we do but not in all areas cos I\n\nknow that uhm in  actuarial sciences all students who are final year\n\nstudents are recruited to go abroad   to  where\n\n<$B>  science is the highest\n\npaying job so there there's a girl living on my block who did\n\n actuarial sciences and you know    well she\n\ncome from Barbados and more than likely she'll be okay anyway but you know I\n\nremember she was saying that it's one of the highest paying jobs in the world\n\nso\n\n\n it's just to show that in their society it's not only  <- >\n\n  actuarists who actually get   this\n\nkind of recruitment\n once you go\n\nto a certain university to University of Toronto everybody want you\n So I think we need more practicality uhm we need to be out in the\n\nfield more with certain things<,> and I know that probably will\n\ncost more and stuff but we need a little bit more of that exposure to help us\n\nto be better persons\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mhm\n So what about like student centred student friendly what about that\n\n<$B>  I don't really think the university is very student friendly\n\nI'm sorry because I mean especially the customer service <unclear>\n\nwords</unclear> and I think a lot of times they just brush us off  \n\nand<,> you have to run behind UWI to get everything done and I just\n\nthink I mean when you want when they have money for you you \n\nhafi run behind them and when them have your money them just hold on\n\nto your <unclear> word</unclear> so\n I don't really think\n\nthey  care right    they're showing\n\nas much as they should be showing as to how they're saying that they are\n\nstudent friendly\n They're not\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  that they're dealing with uhm the\n\nissue    of uhm students who haven't paid their\n\nfees but want to do the exams fairly\n\n<$B>  Well the truth is in all sense of economics they have to\n\nprotect themself right because they can't have everybody just running through\n\nthe place and doing exams and they don't  have them pay for them but\n\n  still everybody's situation is different and<,> I mean they\n\ncan't like stop your life like that because you know they can work out some\n\nkind of way for you to pay them I think but don't have you there maybe hold\n\non to the degree when you finish it but make you finish it you\n\nknow<,>  <- > make make  make you pay them or\n\nsomething like that after but don't hold on don't stop them from sitting the\n\nexams and they have to wait another year and anything like that\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>

of different people from different islands with\n\ndifferent cultures so you get introduced to different people different\n\ncultures a lot of things uh\n\n You get to meet a lot of new friends

Well when I came I found out that uh it was not much different from\n\nhigh school being that you don't always see a lot of people just sitting down\n\nand studying all day\n You see people walking around apart from going to their classes\n\nthey don't do anything else for the entire day until it comes down to the\n\nexam times\n see a lot of people\n\nwho just stay in high school mentality at

have to do like three extra politics courses because my ten\n\ncourses for first year only covered   \n\nthe economic aspect of my studies so to start my politics major \n\n  I have like two extra

they're\n\nencompassing a lot of research and stuff<,> so I go have\n\nto study real hard   <unclear> words</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  courses\n\n<$B>  Uh G T eleven B that's political philosophy and S Y thirteen B\n\nsocial research<,>\n So it's a lot of research and research papers so that gonna take up\n\na lot of my time outside of class time so and studying so I guess that I\n\ndon't really have any time to do anything else basically\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay uhm okay\n What are your views on the situation in Haiti\n\n<$B>  Well basically my views on the situation is Haiti is something\n\nlike this\n Might sound a bit paranoid or something but\n My view is this\n I think that America wants to take Haiti to use it as a military\n\nbase to launch an attack on Cuba basically that's my view\n I think uhm because the fact America basically want to wipe\n\ncommunism out   totally\n is\n\nthe world superpower<,> regardless of what America might\n\nthink<,>\n China is more powerful than America so they can't attack China so\n\nI think they're using Cuba as a catalyst to see how much they gon clamp down\n\non uhm, communism and   all that\n So basically I think that United States of America wants to use\n\nHaiti as a military base to attack Cuba sometime in the near future because\n\nif you check the history you'll find that uh Jean-Bertrand Aristide was\n\nousted from power sometime in the eighties and   \n\nthen he was reinstated by the American government because the\n\nAmerican government wanted somebody to use as a catalyst so they can have\n\ncontrol over Haiti but now they find that Jean-Bertrand Aristide is not that\n\nkind of person because he's not go allow them to push him around so basically\n\nthey're trying in their most power to have him removed from office to get\n\nsomebody in who they can use as a catalyst and all that kind of thing\n So that's basically what I think America wants to do in\n\nHaiti<,>\n think it's fair but that's just the way it\n\nis\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n whole\n\nforeign policy of America\n\n<$B>  I think American foreign policy is a bit lousy because even\n\nthe situation now with Mister  Issan the hotel chains and everything\n\nin Cuba I don't think America has the right to uh it's their country and\n\neverything   and it's a sovereign nation but I don't think they\n\nshould just because he has hotels in Cuba and they're not like have good\n\nrelations with Cuba they  gonna say they go uh take away all people's\n\nfamilies wives his children uh expire all their visa and thing don't allow\n\nthem entry into their country just because of the mere fact that they have\n\nbusinesses in Cuba and they and Cuba is not on a very good  ground\n I think that's a bit unfair and a bit harsh on the part of America\n George Bush is a\n\nreally lousy president uh to be quite frank with you<,>\n I think the America that uhm Bill Clinton left for George Bush was\n\nlike a America that people could look up to<,>\n They didn't have any force or any fights with anybody no worries\n\nor nothing good America economy functioning well lot of money reserves\n And now George Bush comes into power uses all that money that Bill\n\nClinton piled up in reserve for America use it to fight wars and thing\n The economy is in recession\n No one likes America any more basically so it's now a matter of\n\nAmerica against the rest of the world\n\n\na  a lousy job   basically\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  his time is almost over\n\n\n<$B> \n If the people are stupid enough to re-elect him\n uh use his powers to\n\ncurb the election in his way   because based on rumours that's\n\nwhat he did to win in the first   place so anything is possible\n\n  but I would really like if he lose\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n\nthe whole takeover of Haitians of Jamaica this whole whatever you\n\nwant <unclear> words</unclear>\n\n<$B>  Uh well I think uhm I'm not too high on the Haitians coming\n\nbut my view on this    I think as a fellow Caribbean\n\ncountry I think it's not such a bad thing for us to lend a helping hand to a\n\nfellow Caribbean island in a time of need   but I just don't\n\nthink that    we should accommodate them\n\nfor too long a period of time    when\n\nthe situation settles we can accommodate them until this their\n\nsituation in their country settles and everything is back to normal then I\n\nthink it will be time for them to leave but for now with all the uprising and\n\nthing and now they have flooding and everything so\n I don't think the people would have very much to go back to so I\n\nthink for now we can lend our assistance as best as possible\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  What are your views on the political situation in Jamaica\n\njust in general\n\n<$B>  Uh in Jamaica my view basically is that uhm I think uh a lot\n\nof the persons in power now uh I think it would be best if they were to step\n\ndown and give say new people a chance basically because in the\n\nEnglish-speaking Caribbean Jamaica is the only country that both leaders of\n\nboth major parties is past the retirement age\n What\n\n serious\n\n\nover the age of sixty-five\n know Mr\n\nPatterson in particular has made it quite clear that uhm he's gonna step down\n\nsome time   soon\n I don't know what Mr Seaga is up to because based on his budget\n\ndebate speech he doesn't sound like a man who has any intent of stepping down\n\nsoon\n the\n\nJamaica Labour Party would do the party a lot more good   than\n\nbad basically because I think uhm a lot of people would say they're not\n\ngonna support the Jamaica Labour Party for uhm Mr Seaga's sake and for Mr\n\nSeaga to come and say publicly that uhm he doesn't think that there is anyone\n\nin his organisation who is capable of taking over the leadership of the party\n\nI think that doesn't say very much about the party that he is leading because\n\nif you are going to be leading an organisation for over some what a lot of\n\nyears over twenty years and you have people with you there for over that\n\ntwenty years too and you go say persons that been with you for twenty years\n\nand they are still not yet able to take over leadership I think something is\n\nwrong with your organisation so I think uhm Mr Seaga needs to step down give\n\nsomebody a chance and let's see what can happen from there\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM',

stuff helped me to get a\n\nthree-year contract   because the way this university is\n\norganized you know they have different types of   contracts\n A lot of people get temporary appointments which is like a one-year\n\ncontract\n But when it's like a three-year contract it means that you're kind\n\nof good<,>\n tenure down the road\n\n  if you really keep up and work and do the things \n\n to get promoted like be published and all of that\n been here since two thousand one July as an\n\nassistant lecturer\n\n\n cos it's a three-year contract you know so at the end of three\n\nyears they would   review my performance and give me another\n\nthree-year contract or kick me out or demote   me or tell me\n\nthey're not renewing the contract but I got an accelerated promotion    after two years sorry which is based on\n\ngood   performance and everything and that means that I got\n\nanother three- year contract starting after the two-year period\n from two\n\nthousand three to two thousand six<,>\n Is that it\n Or two thousand two to two thousand five\n I got accelerated\n\npromotion   and I have another contract   \n\ntill two thousand six so I could stay here<,>\n and\n\nwe're hearing lots of debate about budget cuts and redundancies \n\n and so and so\n\n\nto put that on if that is  the/a word that I should be using but\n\nit's a bit tricky cos you're doing stuff but you don't know if  <-> you\n\n</- >   how much  you should be\n\ncommitting because   you don't know what the result is going\n\nto be\n\n\nbut at the same time if voluntary redundancy came about should I take\n\nit\n I don't know\n Based on the fact that I need to go back and\n\nstudy<,> like I want to go to my P h D   and\n\nI'm thinking hey maybe that's an option   maybe I should just\n\nleave and go study<,> and then later on  \n\nmaybe after doing the P h D three years four years later I come back\n\nwhen the university would have been back in good   financial\n\nstanding<,>\n But that's an option open\n So right now I'm basically telling people I'm not taking on any new\n\nprojects because we're having some budgetary problems and it might\n\nmean people leaving<,>\n I won't answer that phone\n That's not my phone\n for the\n\ndirector now<,>\n Maybe I should answer it\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Miami\n\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>

have options\n\n<$A> \n Okay\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n\n<$B>  it's interesting the way they're going about\n\nit and     they're cutting mostly they're\n\nfocusing    mostly on the academics and\n\nlooking at class viability and a class must have mhm at least twenty students\n\nto be viable\n If it's less we have to cut it and all of that\n So anyway I think these are interesting times because a lot of\n\nradical propositions that we've had in the past about how this university\n\nshould be run<,> are actually now being<,> listened\n\nto they're being you know they're getting some  more of our attention\n\nbecause here at Carimac we have challenges\n Every year we have over six hundred eight hundred students\n\napplying<,> and we can only take in eighty students based on\n\nspace limitation\n And I've been suggesting that we review the programme\n limited by\n\nour production\n As in we have six production areas\n And they're all lab-related and you know each lab has like twelve\n\ncomputers<,>\n six twelves how much\n\nis that you know<,>\n It works out so we can only take in that amount of students\n I think some of the technique areas can hold more\n intake is\n\nlimited by the fact that we have lab related courses for everybody\n\n\n but that would be sad or do it in such way that we teach the\n\npractical in anotherway by demonstration and  \n\nyou  sort of get hands on in a limited way not necessarily for\n\nthe entire four semesters that we offer it you   know where\n\neach student must be actively involved in production and get one on\n\none<,> one student   to one computer\n thinking\n\noutside of the box and you know reworking our time-table but you know\n\nwhen people are set in their ways<,> it's a bit difficult to\n\nchange and what I'm seeing now    is a situation\n\nwhere people are actually  \n\n accepting the\n Marjan de\n\nBruin here\nHullo\n Yes\n Tell him I'll be with him shortly because I'm just finishing up an\n\ninterview with somebody here\n Okay\n I could probably pass out something for him to look at in the\n\nmeantime as he waits there\n Okay\n Let me come up and see you\n Okay\n Good\n\n\nmore<,>\n Alright\n\n Trust me that administrating this university is such a\n\ntask<,>\n finishing up the financial\n\nsituation thing\n So that was one thing\n and go on to\n\nsomething else\n Yes so hm the point I was making I think was that people are now\n\nlistening to somebody's radical suggestions   like thinking\n\noutside of the box   and those sorts of things\n For example here at Carimac we've never time-tabled a class like a\n\ntheory related class in the afternoon because   \n\nwe have this thinking that its only production must go on in the\n\nafternoon\n\n\nand the production class is like four hours\n So I was looking at the timetable the other day with the\n\nadministrators and saying\n Yes we don't have any space in the mornings because all the time\n\nslots   in the mornings are fully booked and I'm saying\n don't we put a theory class in the\n\nafternoon for example Monday and Wednesdays we have production for second\n\nyear students<,> and Tuesdays and Fridays it's for third year\n\nstudents\n I'd say if the third years have a theory class put it in the\n\nafternoon on Monday and Wednesdays now<,>\n And she\n Uh yes that can work\n\n just\n\nunwilling to change   are reluctant to change but because of\n\nbudget cuts now we're being forced to really   do something\n\nand it's a good thing\n It is a good thing I think\n is going to benefit from it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>

that they're not uhm opposed to the budget cuts\n\nbecause this university has been like a spoilt child for  ,\n\nso long   and <unclear> words</unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  position of being seen as\n\nthe only institution   for tertiary education in  \n\nJamaica and that is no longer the case\n When you say you're going to university now you can't just assume\n\nlike in   the past that it means University of the West Indies\n\nMona Campus or you're going to Mona\n You have to recognize we have another Caribbean university\n University of Technology and then you have\n\nall these

all three campuses when I\n\ngraduated with the highest set of points<,> for the first class\n\nhonours\n I got the Youth Springer Award because of that uh\n I did the B A in Media and Communication

took it and failed it so\n for me\n look forward to failing sometimes\n\nbecause it means that you get to do it   the second time around\n\nand do a better job   at it anyway\n So I did the Carimac entrance test in ninety-three failed it had a\n\nplan B went to C P T C took some of their short-term   courses\n\nlike ten weeks courses and because of that I was able to get training in\n\nvideo production voice and speech and sound\n\n\nbecause I was now studying phonetics<,> and learning vowel\n\nsounds and consonant sounds\n left C P T C\n\ncame back to UWI in ninety-four and did the Carimac entrance test again the\n\nsecond time around\n and there was no\n\nturning back you know it was interesting to see that somebody who failed the\n\ntest in ninety-three graduated in ninety-seven   with top first\n\nclass honours    which you know getting the\n\nhighest set of scores<,> for the degree\n so I got the highest\n\nset of points on my degree on all three campuses\n So I was shocked\n\n\nexpect it as they would say in Jamaica<,>\n\n\n you did fail the test too a year ago so I don't have the\n\naptitude to   do this but I guess it forced me to work hard\n\n ,  and to value my position here in   the\n\nuniversity and in you know not take it for granted   so\n\nthat is what happened with that\n left from UWI and got my first job\n and\n\ncoming on T V and all of that\n linguistics\n\n Uh\n I'm now doing the M Phil and ooh\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>

M Phil\n I'm enjoying it\n I\n\nsee an  object\n People ask me\n Why are you reading for an M Phil in linguistics and you're doing\n\ncommunication\n you be doing\n\ncommunication\n And I say\n\n\n between language and communication  , and I do\n\nstudies    in communication\n I'm doing development communication and there is always the thing\n\nof message design and   in campaigning,  for social change\n\n\nlinguistics in there   that we need to look at\n\n\n,  messages in signs\n the grammar\n authoritative voice\n\n\nCreole<,> to get it to a particular audience\n What does it mean\n come out the\n\nvariables come out and I'm finding the link it's there<,>\n in in\n\nmyfor my thesis<,> for the dissertation that\n\nI'll write and look at how we train people   to speak because\n\nhere at Carimac we have to train announcers to speak on radio on television\n\n\n when we actually teach that sort   of<,> thing\n You know to teach broadcast announcement teach people how to speak\n You know the children will come to us expecting to hear the right\n\nway to pronounce a word   for example and what does that\n\nmean<,>\n Anyway\n So those are some interesting questions to ask in the area of\n\nspeech pedagogy and applied linguistics and phonetics and articulated\n\nphonetics   and so on\n So that's what I'm studying\n But back to the B A degree which is what I was talking about\n We're digressing a lot now\n I was studying the B A in communication did minor in linguistics\n\nworked at C P T C part-time but not in such a way that it affected my \n\n studies here\n\n\nwrap it from time to time but it would be done during semester break\n\n  or when we actually had a free day<,>\n\nmeaning we had no classes on that day or we had a class in the morning\n\nand then   left and  go into the production\n After that I left in ninety-seven and worked for a year on Green\n\nExpo<,> an environmental exposition   so this is the<,>\n man it was getting my experience in campaign planning\n\nand you know   design the messages and posters and T V\n\nadvertisementsradio advertisements and so on\n\n\nwasn't\n\n\ncommunication   with various stake holders to get this event\n\nhappening and it's a national exposition  , held at the\n\nNational Arena\n And after that I did that\n then I applied\n\nfor the Fulbright scholarship got it and had to sit down\n I applied in ninety-eight and discovered I had to wait one year\n\n     to be placed<,>\n So I was placed in ninety-nine and that's when I left\n life in a nutshell\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>

standing outside\n He has an open door policy but when I went in he said\n close the door\n This is excellent writing\n\n So I got an A and he said this\n I forgot the comment he wrote on it and I can't find the paper\n\nthough and I think   I lent it to a student but I'll try and\n\ncome across it soon\n It was a content analysis I did for him\n And he said the paper was so well written\n I think that was the comment\n\n And I should consider presenting it at a conference and getting it\n\npublished\n I didn't pursue the publication but I should have because since I\n\npresented it at a conference at the National Communication Association\n\nConference in Seattle Washington back in about November two thousand<,> about\n\nthree persons have e-mailed me from the abstract that's posted  \n\nonline asking me for a copy of the research instruments  \n\nthe code book and the code sheet<,> and I sent it to \n\n them quite willingly and they have  read or followed through\n\nwith the<,>\n There was someone from Mexico another girl from another\n\nuniversity<,>\n So the research actually got feedback\n\n\nsex role stereotypes   on M T V\n And I you know I got that\n So he said the paper was well written because compared to their\n\nwriting standard he said   it must be related to where you're\n\ncoming from your tradition you know\n think you do a lot of essay\n\nwriting<,> for exam purposes for evaluation where in their\n\nsystem it's a lot of multiple choice  \n he said that there was a marked difference in the\n\nquality of writing\n here\n\nI was in graduate school\n how the transition took place\n a lot\n\nof essay at that level but for students coming out of their system to that\n\nlevel<,> it was a challenge for them making the transition\n\nbecause they were used to multiple choice A B C   D choose an\n\nanswer\n\n That was no problem for me\n And the resources were there\n computers\n\nsaying use me<,>\n At the time when I left University of the West Indies in

response from everybody\n and\n\ndon't know how to swim\n And so why you're making the assumption that everybody who live on\n\nan island know how to swim\n Anyway\n I come back here and I've been going to the UWI swimming pool\n\nevery Sunday since December twenty-seven last year\n, I get up and went\n doing the self-taught\n\nthing you see and I taking no swimming   lessons\n But I've been eavesdropping on people's swimming lessons\n For the swimming instructor would be there teaching other people\n\nand I'm standing within earshot\n to get the\n\nbreast stroke<,> and I'm doing all of that to get breast stroke\n\nand I don't know how to do the breast stroke<,> but for the life\n\nof me I haven't gone into the deep end of the pool   as yet\n\n The breathing is a challenge for me and I remember while learning\n\nto swim in Florida State University they taught me to breathe through my nose\n\n  and somebody told me that that's for competitive swimming\n through\n\nyour mouth\n So I'm listening to all the tips and you know everybody come in\n\nthe water\n to swim and\n\neverybody give you a little tip<,>\n\n\nword</unclear>\n\n So I'm getting there\n out for a month or two because I had\n\nother things   to do on Sunday\n I was off the island\n But I'm back now\n I started back last week Sunday and it's wonderful\n I know to do the breast stroke\n the\n\nfreestyle<,> with the flutter kick and the <unclear> word(s)</unclear>\n\n  you know the jargon    and the\n\ntalking   about this\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Back\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  is the best one for somebody\n\nwho's just learning to swim\n\n<$A>  I'm going to sink into the water\n\nI know it should be that but I have a thing a problem floating\n after that I need to learn to do the\n\nbutterfly kick no   the butterfly stroke with the dolphin kick\n That what it's called\n\n\n<$B>  Cos you're breathing\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Okay\n sure you're\n\nquite there yet\n\n<$A> \n It's the progress\n\n\n\nsign up for lessons maybe in the   summer when I'm not so busy I\n\ntry to   sign up for lessons\n\n\n two hours\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  It's just\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nexercise and so <unclear> word</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nyou know this lifestyle thing and   healthy lifestyles\n and you know sit down and\n\nget big and fat<,> and really and truly I should do some\n\nexercise\n I want to also walk around Ring Road I'm trying to get the office\n\nhere the people in the office to actually\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  To do it\n\n<$A> \n They probably won't consider the swimming thing cos you have to\n\nreally go   to change or shower afterwards a bit technical and\n\nbit much  \n walk around Ring Road you just walk around Ring Road but I\n\nguess you still have to change   also into your<,> track bottoms\n\nand put on track shoes and walk around Ring Road and you're sweating and you\n\ncome back and change and all of that<,>\n But anyway\n So physical activity is something I'm looking forward to\n So the plans for the near future just to finish off your little\n\ndiscussion here and   get your corpus<,>  so\n\nthey complete\n And to finish up my M Phil in linguistics I have exams next week\n Wish me luck\n I need to go study\n\n\n  <unclear> one-or-two- words</unclear> work\n And then I have two essays due\n in\n\nlinguistics there's another summer   school here at Carimac to\n\nteach in\n And then I come back next year hopefully I'll be doing my proposal\n\nfor my research   doing up my research\n once I\n\nfinish that I want to go up to do the P h D in\n\ncommunication<,>\n I'm not considering a P h D in linguistics right now\n way way down the\n\nline\n want something else\n\nto study\n So the goal the ultimate goal is rather to have two P h D one in\n\nlinguistics and one in communication\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yeah\n Hm\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  This\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Uhu\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  I'm thinking about that\n\n\n<$A>  to see people with two P h Ds\n\nyou know\n who was\n\ntelling me that my thing was well written he has two P h Ds\n\n\ncommunication\n\n\nthink based on what I'm studying it will help me to have  \n\nthat sort of   background from linguistics as well as from\n\ncommunication because I do a lot of speech work\n I teach a lot of works at speech classes public speaking\n\nclasses<,>\n So it will help me to have that background in linguistics\n I think it's helping already\n I kind of look forward to better things\n\nhappening because of it\n\n and tape me in the other\n\nmeeting that I have because this person is waiting but we really need\n\nto<,> work\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>

\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n Because we have books\n We've published books we write a whole book and publish and we sell\n\n And you know some people just need information for themselves\n And they

but uhm I still have\n\nanother year to go still have some credits to finish<,> because\n\nit's only\n I signed on full-time September last year but actually I was\n\npart-time all along<,>\n But it wasn't bad just running to class running come back to work\n\nand all of that\n\n\nfull-time UWI  full-time courses with full-time job is hard\n about some of\n\n them in the night so\n But it worked out some way\n Have to work\n Eh\n You have to work\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n\nfull-time<,> full-time school   and\n\nfull-time work<,>\n Wow\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  And full-time work\n\n\n<$B>  But what happened is that I could not take the full load\n\nalthough I'm full-time student<,>\n\n Fifteen right\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  If you're a first semester\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  Mhm\n\n<$B>  Okay I still carrying the full-time load then cos they were\n\nsaying that I cheated myself because<,> I only took four courses this\n\nsemester\n But then they still add up to the fifteen credits because one is a\n\nsix-credit course<,>\n Mhm\n But I'm trying to finish\n I probably will\n up\n I have to see how much credit I'll need though\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n\n<$A> \n\narea\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\nobviously\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n\njust right  just to get by   but doing\n\nsomething else   you know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n They found me I didn't find it\n\n<$A>  like it\n\n<$B> \n I'm learning to\n\n\nbecause the first job I went into was a library I started working  \n\nwith uhm Jamaica library service when I left high school\n go study\n\nlibrary I  said no<,> not at all\n But then this is the second job and it happened to be in a library\n\nagain<,>\n\n Yeah\n\n applied\n\nfor UWI I applied for management studies<,> and didn't get in\n So the second year I said\n Now I have to get in\n And I applied for library studies\n\n\ndoing library\n So I think I will stick with it\n Got used to it by now you know\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  sure sure\n\n\n  at the beginning you know\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nsettle down now\n I have to settle down and find\n\n<$A> \n\n you decide you know I can do library after all because you came\n\nto UWI and see some young people\n\n<$B> \n Doing it\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  I don't know\n And I don't find it easy now\n\n you know\n\nworking in a library I said\n Oh why would I want to go study library nothing to know you\n\nknow<,>\n But then in it now I find it hard studying it\n So I don't think it's for me\n I do better at the other courses\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n So uhm what exactly why you say it's hard what exactly doesn't\n\ncome  off\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  getting it\n\n\njarg  the library jargon there or what but<,> sometimes I\n\ndon't know I'm just not getting it<,>\n Or is it that they just mark hard\n Somebody was telling me that a lecturer who's been in our\n\ndepartment just marks hard\n\n know but I do better at other subjects\n But because then I just like sociology and all of the others I get\n\nbetter grades\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  thought of\n\ntransferring  of schools\n\n<$B>  Yeah but then to do all of those extra credits to catch up I\n\ncouldn't bother\n started I was going to\n\ntransfer to management studies and probably starting the management studies\n\ncourses\n And then I decided that you know my grandmother got sick and I\n\ndropped out of UWI for a while\n I came back I said\n Now man I have to finish something\n\n\ngo do the management studies<,> all over again<,>\n And I said no\n Start library studies already let me just finish it\n And so when I came back in September I just signed up for all\n\nlibrary courses and I'm trying to finish\n So by next year I should be out\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  a lot of persons\n\ndoing it\n\n<$B>  Mhm\n A lot of young people this year\n I was surprised\n you know\n\nlike between  late teens to<,>  \n\n late twenties\n Normally it used to be a lot of old people\n some fifty year\n\nold\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  You're wondering\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  recorder cos she coming in here to\n\nbe bad\n\n<$A>  Come and be bad\n\n<$B>  want to interview you coming\n\nto interview you\n\n<$C>  No we haven't\ninterruption-of-\n\nrecording\n\n<$A>  has like\n\ndifferent sections that do different things\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  We have different staff members\n\n Though we have a branch in Trinidad\n So we just basically have different staff members\n We just like a one-man team for each section like we have a\n\nnutrition educator public uh nutritionist uhm medical dietician food\n\neconomist you know just one person for each section\n And the secretaries they don't have their own uhm like a personal\n\n  secretary\n So they will have like a project they call them project\n\nsecretaries\n So like one secretary would have to work with\n\nthree<,> technical staff\n The only person who might have his own secretary is the director\n\nyou know\n Basically that's it\n whatever you need like you know like some person who might\n\nwant you to come in and give a talk or give a presentation they're doing that\n\nsort of a thing and they're going and they do lectures like on campus UWI\n\nwherever\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n Hello how you're doing\n\n<$A>  have\n\nlike you come and you want like some<,> if

\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  They have a the medical dietician or the nutritionists will\n\nhelp you\n But sometimes they will refer you to the dietician at the\n\nhospital<,>\n\n\nhospital is mostly for the

Mm\n No\n\n busy doing other\n\nthings<,>\n They're trying to create you know like they do bigger\n\nstuff<,> so to do one for you on a personal like an individual\n\nlevel most time they don't have the time to do it\n, if they have the\n\ntime\n Yeah\n out travelling to different\n\ncountries  gotta remember we serve the Caribbean<,> and\n\nit's like eighteen Caribbean countries in the region that we serve\n So most of their days are spent in other countries\n You hardly find that\n The only reason you see most of them on staff this week because we\n\nhad a lot of <unclear> words</unclear> during last week and we had some\n\nstudents coming from <unclear> place-name</unclear>\n one-or-\n\ntwo-words</unclear> <unclear> place-name</unclear> university\n And students are here for two weeks\n\n Okay\n a lot of time you might come and you can't\n\nfind anyone  near it\n You know they have to run workshops all over the place and suppose\n\nthe government like you know in Jamaica with our School Feeding Programme\n\nthat the ministry will ask us to assist with the School Feeding Programme\n\n\nfood that people should eat\n\n country needs some help or some\n\nassistance with some

like the\n\nfirst semester I said no way<,>\n resist the\n\nneed<,> change  it no harm to the psychologist\n\nsocio-psychologist   so that's it basically\n second and\n\nfirst year<,> and all that all

you\n\nknow\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  only\n\ndegree is definite so you have a job in <unclear> words</unclear> but you\n\nknow that if that's what you're gonna do is medicine you definitely know\n\nalright I'm going be a doctor if    there is a chance<,> or<,>\n\nnursing\n\n<$B>  Yeah yeah but then no but by the time you get\n\nthere you   then they say no you have to specialize and\n\nyou have to   <unclear> words</unclear> like that\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nor in accounting <unclear> several-words</unclear> alright I can do\n\nsome accounting and so you have that level\n For management study I

lot\n\nof times we do these degrees here   and by the time we get out\n\nthere we just take a job okay<,>\n so it doesn't\n\nreally matter if you have a management studies degree\n into this\n\n  work

word</unclear> some two days for evening\n\ntwo evenings for a week but trust me when  there's someone like\n\n<unclear> words</unclear> some of them bored and all of that uhm in things\n\nright now\n So how is you\n\n<$B>  Alright you know kind of working now and that kind of take away\n\nsome of the boredom\n\n<$A>  Okay so how does it feel to you know have completed your three\n\nyears at UWI\n\n<$B>  It feels good well\n I'm not too worried anymore about you know moving on as I'm looking\n\nforward to start work\n job\n That's in the making\n\n<$A>  Okay\n It should be nice if I get something to do starting September\n\n<unclear> words</unclear>  easy for done three years at school and\n\nthen go home and sit down like <unclear> word</unclear> it kind of gets\n\nfrustrating\n But anyway girl you'll get something to do and now it's always that\n\nloverman of yours\n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A>  I wish I could say the same thing about\n\nmyself\n\n<$B>  Oh really what's happening\n\n<$A> \n\nbeing possessive and jealous<,> and jealous\n I don't know the whole day you get to think it becomes more and\n\nmore insecure but Tereka you know that's older men's style they always I mean\n\nseem to get insecure whenever they have a young sexy <unclear>\n\nwords</unclear>\n\n\n<$B>  Alright but you really think all older men is like that or you\n\nthink it has something to do with the fact that you're at UWI and\n\n<$A>  but in terms maybe the fact that I'm\n\nan  <- >   intellect that should not stop\n\nanything with him because he has gone to high school and all of that\n He chose not to be here and if you ask me he has accomplished a lot\n\nin comparison to those who have been here and all of that\n So I don't think so but I have a lot of friends who talk to mature\n\nmen and most of them complain of the same problem\n Somebody said to me maybe when they love you too much they behave\n\nlike that and they don't want to lose you so they try to <unclear>\n\none-or-two-words</unclear> to keep you the <unclear> word</unclear> close to\n\nthem but to me personally I think I'm\n They get overly possessive or jealous\n For me that is turning me off\n That's not how you deal with it\n If you want to keep me then you have to use different strategies\n\nnot that way\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Okay\n\n<$A>  So\n is like that\n\n<$B>  No actually well I guess when we just started talking he was\n\nkind of<,> you know always wondering\n who my friends\n\nare on campus   and especially because he knew I was in a\n\nrelationship with somebody on   campus before and you know\n\nwondering<,> if    you're talking\n\nabout their personal  , \n\n\nyou are on campus or a community   the university and your\n\nboyfriend is not   or your partner<,>\n\n\nwhere you see you know  <- > people more  you're\n\nmore likely to find people of your age<,> people who\n\nhave the same goals like you and<,> all of that so I don't\n\nknow if that's a part of the problem\n I think that is it sometimes\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  feel\n\nrather insecure if <unclear> one-or-two-words</unclear> their partner\n\n<unclear> several-words</unclear> have the edge over them in terms of\n\neducation\n Uhm to me and this is sometime I think that's the major problem\n\nbecause you have like difference in goals and opinion and they don't seem to\n\nsee things more logical\n I\n\nshould walk out of this relationship now I wouldn't talk to anybody who is\n\nnot within my<,> <unclear> word(s)</unclear>\n\n<$B>  you would probably\n\ntalk to somebody at university or   <unclear> words</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  necessarily at university but some in terms\n\nof basically on par with my educational goals or\n\n<$B>  Where you're heading\n\n\n<$A>  or something because a lot\n\nof them out there especially the bigger men they have business places and\n\nthey have money and they have a lot of <unclear> words</unclear> but they may\n\nnot have a university degree or college diploma and so that to me will\n\n<unclear> word</unclear> how they see things\n You as an intellectual see things differently in my opinion that's\n\nwhat I think and we think more rational and you know we're quicker to reason\n\nout    things rather to be\n\njudgemental\n But as I say that's how they are and sometimes it makes sense to\n\nwork with  people who are ready because you don't know whom to trust\n\ncos if you leave one you might just end up    to\n\nsomebody else who is worse\n So sometimes you have to try to work out things if not if there is\n\nno way you can work it out or it's not heading into the direction that you\n\nwant it to go then you have to move on\n But for you you're young and there are many nice men out there and\n\nyou have perceived your goal at a tender age so I wouldn't tell you    to get too caught up in a relationship right now and\n\nbefore <unclear> one- or-two-words</unclear>  end up because at times\n\nthat is what  hurt the relationship and you as the individual I don't\n\nknow you could be pregnant and end up you know\n What do you think\n\n<$B>  if you find\n\nsomeone at any stage that you really think you are that comfortable\n\nwith<,> you try your best to let it work<,> I mean\n\n   there are still no guarantees  \n\nthat you know after you've finished school or anything then is when\n\nyou'll find\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  you don't know who's the\n\nperfect one   because nobody's perfect\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nleast I know I think    I have found somebody who\n\nI can really relate to<,>\n the moment I don't have a\n\nproblem with the relationship at all<,> and<,> I\n\nthink you know it's at a point where you just see what's going to happen or\n\nwork towards having something great to happen  , \n So I don't know I think sometimes you have to make sacrifices and\n\ncompromises<,> and\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  but sometimes you compromise too much\n\nand that person is not going to <unclear> words</unclear>  out way\n\n  so but    I think\n\npersonally    major problem in a\n\nrelationship is communication and if once communication starts\n\nbreaking down then definitely something is wrong\n in order to you know get\n\nthings done and all of that<,>\n For me communication is very important in the endurance of any\n\nrelationship at all no matter how old or young or in between the person might\n\nbe\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Oh that is very sure that's very important true\n\n<$A>  Enough of that\n So what about you\n You're doing summer school\n\n<$B>  well I want to do this course uhm in\n\nlinguistics L thirty- seven A I think<,>\n seems like a really interesting\n\ncourse<,> field methods in linguistics and we're supposed to go\n\nto Guyana and Surinam\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  For how long\n That sounds interesting\n\n<$B>  Uhm I think it's for a week like you spend about three days in\n\nGuyana and two days in Surinam   something like\n\nthat<,> but you know\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\ncomfortable for the summer is long and if you don't work for the summer or if\n\nyou don't do anything for the summer it can be boring so anything to make it\n\ncomfortable and you know this allows you to  learn <unclear>\n\nwords</unclear> go for it\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  So what you're doing for summer\n\n<$A>  Well as I mentioned before I'm at home except for two days two\n\nevenings uhm when I go to <unclear> name</unclear> to do<,> piano lessons as\n\nI really love music and I think I have a little talent in singing so I think\n\nas I sing I should be able too at any time at any stage in a life be able to\n\nplay a musical instrument so\n doing\n My aunt comes in June and I think you know when she comes we will\n\nwant go all over the place so I'm just chilling for now   until\n\nthen\n\n<$B>  you're doing\n\nno summer school no work\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  I think I'm lazy\n\n<$B>  You're\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$B> \n\n studying<,> and all of that basically\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  uhm supposed to\n\nwork next year hopefully <unclear> words</unclear> so I'm making use of all\n\nthe free time because when I go back to work if I go back in teaching then\n\nthere's hardly any time I'm going to be here sitting around or idling or\n\ntalking to you so\n\n<$B>  going to\n\nbe working in your final year or\n\n<$A>  No man\n I mean after I finish UWI next year May I supposed to return to\n\nwork September<,> and I'm saying after I start working again\n\nthere's hardly any time I'm going to get for myself<,> you know\n\nso I'm    making use of all the free time now\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  That makes a lot of sense\n\n<$A>  Mhm mhm so that's it\n\n\n<$B> \n\ns  semester\n\n<$A>  Well it makes sense\n I heard that next semester definitely you will be getting your\n\ncredits\n\n And if I'm getting the credits then it makes sense\n to start\n\nsomething afresh again or anew because I've been singing in it from uhm I've\n\nbeen here although it's a bit boring but<,> I think I'll continue cos as I\n\nsaid I have a passion for singing and no matter what where I was singing is\n\nthat always you're part of that I think I would <unclear> words</unclear>\n\n<$B>  Okay you can become to the next American Idol\n\n<$A>  By the way speaking of uhm American Idol did you watch the\n\nfinal last night and <unclear> word</unclear>  to be done\n\n<$B>  Yeah uh well I didn't watch everything but I watched the part\n\nwhen she won that's   I was  surprised\n\n<$A>  which one of the girls\n\n<$B>  Fantasia the black girl she won\n\n<$A>  Okay\n the white girl what came in\n\nthe second round of it   or something because I saw the\n\npreview on the television this morning and I saw both of them talking and\n\nthey were interviewing both of them\n So I'm wondering which you know but I knew from before and that\n\nFantasia would have gotten in because to me she really sounds<,> trust me\n\nthat girl can really really really sing\n I don't think she needed that competition if you ask me\n All she need to do now is to go and do some albums for herself and\n\nall of that\n\n\npersonally\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  I thought well for one I was if we win we\n\nall knew that Fantasia was the best singer it was so obvious<,>\n\nbut then as somebody else said to me that it's America and majority\n\nwhiteand    they vote for the\n\nwhite girl   but\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  was thinking along that line too you know\n\n<$B>  we weren't\n\nsurprised cos we weren't   I wouldn't have been\n\nsurprised if Diana won   on that basis but it's \n\n quite evident that    Fantasia is the best\n\nsinger<,>\n the whole\n\npackage      she\n\nperformed\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  is really really good\n\n<$B>", 'subdomain':

make\n\nmoney\n Look at some of our singers\n To me they don't have the good talent of singing\n they\n\njust  especially D Js they just sing any and anything and once\n\nit has a nice rhythm to it    they reach peak\n\nand they can achieve so much\n So I would do that sing full time and play music as I tell you I'm\n\ndoing piano\n\n<$B>  Alicia Keys thing\n\n<$A>  Yes Alicia Keys thing and shake my boody and so on\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n No that is not what I am saying I don't\n Why do you think you need to go shake boody\n I don't understand these women you know\n\n<$A>  so even\n\nif I want to shake it I'll shake it but I wouldn't shake it man\n That's not for me\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> So what are you doing for the rest of the day\n\n<$A>  We're going to visit some friends\n I don't know\n I spoke to him before I came\n but\n\nI've seen him before I left\n a good friend\n\nat the <unclear> word</unclear> have chitchats and then go to <unclear>\n\nword</unclear> for the thing and then after that I'm supposed to be seeing my\n\ngrandmother downtown or something\n and\n\nsleep\n\n<$B>  to\n\nlook for your cousin too\n\n<$A> \n\nand <unclear> words</unclear> see her might have to come back in the\n\nnight or another time\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n Good\n going to live on next\n\nsemester or you're going to stay off campus\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nto me wouldn't make any sense right now because of for the two years I've\n\nbeen jobbing so I think I can manage the third year   whatever\n\nhappens\n It wouldn't make sense to live on\n I would love to because it's the final year and you'd want to mix\n\nand mingle and enjoy you know a little<,> friendship<,>\n\n\ncommunal living is something that I always enjoy\n mind living\n\non but trust me I don't have that money right now so I think I'm going to\n\n<unclear> word(s)</unclear> from <unclear> word(s)</unclear> as I always did\n\nin the past\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  you\n\nand I and most of your friends are in final year and we leaving now\n What are you going to do\n\n<$A>  Well every day I think about it\n I don't know what next year is going to be like and it's like I\n\nthink it's going to be a disaster\n sit under the tree\n\nby myself go to the library by myself<,>\n You know I'm a very sociable person so you know I'll always have\n\npeople    coming around and \n\n talk to me and everything but is who you really hang out with and\n\nshare certain things with<,>\n I think it's going to be very bored I think it's not tardier for me\n\nI can foretell that it's not going to be a nice year\n I don't think so in terms of having no friends my good friends are\n\ngone\n I don't even want to talk about it\n Let's change the subject\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Oh my God is it that bad\n\n<$A>  I think or maybe you never can tell maybe somebody just pops\n\nup\n\n<$B>  form a new\n\nassociation\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Right and they\n have to accept that you\n\nknow because<,> at some point in our lives good friends have to part and it's\n\nsomething that we all have to get used to because no matter where you are\n\nsomebody you get close with at some point in time they either migrate or gone\n\nsomewhere else to work or\n\n\nuhm  you have to prepare for that   anywhere you go\n\neven in the workplace\n Sometimes you meet friends at work and they end up leaving the job\n\nfor some reason or the other\n You might be leaving this feel the same way about it\n So no matter where you are you have to get used to the fact that\n\ngood friends will come and they will at one point leave<,> leave\n\nyou alone<,> and you have to mourn the <unclear> word</unclear>\n\nbut it's a part of life and I think I'm mature enough to deal with that\n\nbecause I'm not going to  sticks and from I've been to Michael and all\n\nof that I realized that good people come    into your\n\nlife and then at one point they have to leave\n So for me I think I can deal with it although I dread thinking\n\nabout it\n Uh how do you feel\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Oh uhm it's going to be tough but at least I'll plan that as\n\nmuch as possible to stay in contact   you know e-mail and phone\n\ncalls as much as   possible\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n persons\n\nwhen they leave they think that's it   and sometimes even if you\n\njust ring the phone one time and say hi how are you doing I think that makes\n\na lot of difference<,>\n I\n\nmean we might not be able to see    each\n\nother but I think<,> we can keep the link we can link up some point  \n\nsome holiday we link and we go here there enjoy ourselves chat and laugh\n\ntalk about things we used to do in the past<,> talk about things\n\nthat is happening now or to happen\n if you value the\n\nperson friendship and you think the person is somebody you want to keep in\n\ntouch with   there's no way you're going to I mean let that\n\ncandle out\n You're going to always try to keep the candle burning\n So go for it\n It would be unfair for me to say my friends are to stay with me at\n\nUWI   for another year and whatever when they have their life\n\nahead of them\n They have to go and plan their future earn money and you know\n\nstart thinking about family life and about life in general at least  \n\nyou know they have to move on   so why sit on time over\n\nthem and they have to move on<,>\n It would be unfair because next year I'm sure those who I'm going\n\nto leave here they are going to miss me the same way but I have to move\n\non<,> cos I have to do what I have to do\n you know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Been through it before with Michael\n\n<$A>  Right been through it\n It was terrible at Michael because then I was pretty\n\nyoung<,> and to me just leaving home going to uhm tertiary\n\ninstitution getting close to  first time being away from home for\n\nso long meeting friends going out on my own nobody to tell me don't go don't\n\nstay come back this time don't overstay\n So to me that was where I got most of my freedom and that is why I\n\nthink  <-> I </- >  I had enjoyed Michael to the\n\nfullest and when I was leaving trust me I had to cry because it was really\n\nyou know the bond in terms of friendship and the whole communal living and\n\neverything it was the best to me and even at   \n\nUWI now  it is<,> obvious you can see as somebody coming  <->\n\nfrom</- >  straight from high school the type of relationship that\n\nMichonians   you know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  I tend to notice is that they stick\n\ntogether and all of that   so\n\n<$A> \n Stick together and we have a different thing about us we just go\n\nto  rap no matter where you are and see each other this thing about\n\nyou know closeness is still there\n So you can see it's obvious that that's where we live but as I\n\nsaid Tereka we all have to move on and    it makes no sense to sit and think of the past and\n\n<unclear> one-or-two- words</unclear>\n Just think about the future move ahead and see\n Those who keep in touch well you keep in touch and you keep the\n\nlink\n Those who fail to keep in touch then that's it\n When you see them years to come you still greet them and you know\n\n<$B>  Try and catch up\n\n<$A>  Try and catch up\n\n\n<$B> \n\n\nyour friend <unclear> words</unclear> Anne-Marie\n\n<$A>  She's alright you know we spoke but not much\n As I told you before I'm very genuine and as soon as I find out\n\nthat somebody who I considered to be a friend is not heading not totally in\n\nmy direction but at me showing some sign of interest and being genuine to me\n As soon as I realize that you fail to do that then I'm going to\n\ncut you off and with her I don't think<,> she's all that genuine\n I don't think\n\nshe'd value my friendship and I've found out very late and so because\n\nI've found out that as I tell you I'm very mature I don't want to just cut\n\noff and you know cut off the communication totally\n So we call each other now and then very rarely\n first\n\nyear we used to talk a lot on the phone I mean like every evening or two \n\n  actually every evening <unclear>\n\none-or-two-words</unclear> but trust me things have changed and over time you\n\nget to know who is who and who means you good and who is just here to use\n\nyou<,>\n So that is that for now\n So we'll talk\n I'll call you later\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Alright", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

soon be going back over into\n\nIraq\n He's not really a frontline person so I'm not like a hundred\n\npercent worried yet because    he's like\n\na I don't know one of them warehouse type persons  doing some\n\nquartermaster duties\n So I think him say him control a warehouse type of thing\n You know take picture with them humvee and thing yes Uncle Sam\n\nvehicle<,,>\n do him tour already I don't\n\nknow why him don't leave the stupid army now but then you see people ask me\n\nif I going go fight war too\n Jamaica army not going fight no war\n The only war we going have is Tivoli and them place and even so I\n\nwon't even be going down there because I'll be going in the air wings<,> so\n\nI'd still be okay free from all of them stress\n\n<$B>  Okay\n So you'll be training with J D F\n\n<$A>  Hopefully hopefully\n\n<$B> \n\ndo you call it\n\n<$A>  surveillance air sea rescue then the\n\nwhole heap of stuff whole heap of stuff\n I think the coolest thing they do is how they land their chopper\n\nright over the hospital\n Oh boy I don't even remember what them call that operation\n\nbut\n You know when them carry people from hospitals like in the country\n\ncome up to  sick people thing because of \n\nadmissions<,>\n small piece of grass\n\nthem just land  it\n It look even better in the night\n You really wonder how them find it\n So it's them thing I want to do\n train and come back and living on\n\nthe J D F for a while\n Yeah\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  So you start to do anything towards that lately\n\n<$A>  at J D F\n I'm actually waiting on them to call me now so\n any time now I should be getting a call from them\n\nhopefully<,>\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Mhm\n\n\n<$A> \n Actually I've started flying already I don't think I mentioned\n\nthat\n\n I've been flying since ninety-nine\n Started ground school in ninety-eight August of ninety-eight\n I got my P P L in June\n\n<$B>  What's a P P L\n\n<$A>  Now Private Pilot's License\n\n<$B> \n Oh\n\n<$A>  And uhm\n Yeah I've been flying since just basically to stay current to go\n\nby them air  laws so that the license don't lapse cos it cost like a\n\nwhole week to get it back up\n So it's easier to maintain it basically\n\n<$B>  Mhm\n\n\n<$A>  Well not really but kind of\n\n<$B>  So you're living on campus or you're off\n\n<$A>  I moved off like earlier this week\n\n<$B>  Mhm\n Where were you before\n\n<$A>  On Chancellor Hall\n\n<$B>  Oh Chancellor the great Chancellor\n I always wonder about living on Chancellor always you know I used\n\nto wonder about Chancellor Hall\n\n<$A>  Really\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  All male\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n Right\n Yeah\n What do you want to know about Chancellor\n\n<$B>  Mhm what's up with this I noticed that Chancellor has this\n\nwhole I guess that all other halls this whole I don't know thing about them\n\nthis whole history spirit by its reputation whatever you want to call it\n\n<$A>  Mhm\n Well not like all other halls really\n\n\nand the few people that come out as scholars the few good scholars we\n\nhave few great people that have passed through the hall kind of thing\n I think that's that\n and\n\nstuff\n\n\nwell I wouldn't say  nutten so great but it's not a whole heap\n\nfor fifty years I think it could have been more<,> but    it's okay\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  So what did you do on Chancellor\n You did anything\n\n<$A>  I played volleyball for Chancellor\n\n<$B>  Okay\n So how was that\n\n<$A>  It was okay\n I played what one two three years\n One two and the last one year\n Of course their biggest rival is Taylor Hall\n\n<$B>  Okay\n\n<$A>  Actually I tell you a trick\n In my first year I was attached to Taylor\n That year I never lived on hall any at all I used to commute\n But then when I decided to live on hall I change and live on\n\nChancellor Hall\n\n<$B>  Why\n\n<$A>  Don't know\n\n\n\nlive  live on Chancellor\n\n<$B>  Okay\n I see\n I mean Chancellor and Taylor always seem to have this thing going\n\nthough some kind of rivalry\n\n<$A>  back in\n\nthe days but it's  nutten like that now\n I think people get smarter\n\n<$B>  you think so\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n\nname</unclear> was telling us this man that lectures down in chemistry he was\n\ntelling us that in his time when they used to go and do raids over Taylor\n\nHall they got a new lock\n And they used to go and they screw off all the door locks and\n\nscrew out the floats out the toilets a whole heap of thing crazy stuff\n I mean\n\nprobably there woulda be like some serious war <unclear> words</unclear>\n Yes as I said people get smarter\n\n<$B>  Thank God\n\n<$A>  knuckleheads on\n\nthe hall that keep on depriving some Irvinites of their underwear\n They have done it two times since I've been there\n About two years in a row right after or within the time of Lions\n\nWeek\n They just go over and I don't know just go on the lines I guess\n\njust take all the underwears off and just decorate the tree\n\n\nnutten\n You just wake up and see the tree well decorated\n\n<$B>  Is that like a Chancellor tradition\n\n<$A>  No\n I don't know\n I don't know about that\n We never learn that in orientation about going and taking nobody\n\nthing\n\n<$B> So where did it come from\n\n<$A>  I don't know I guess I think it's something of the past like\n\nlong long time<,,> something from some back-in-the-days thing you know\n Somebody probably hear it and think it might be cool if them try\n\nit now and tried it I guess\n\n<$B>  Okay\n So where you're living now that you're off\n\n<$A>  In Portmore back at me mummy\n\n<$B>  Oh how is that\n\n<$A> \n but I've\n\nnever been travelling in the peak hours\n later in the\n\nmorning later in the night\n So I've not really met the traffic yet\n Hopefully I don't have to meet it\n\n<$B>  Mhm\n Portmore though is\n\nterrible cos I have to come here early in the morning like eight thirty and I\n\nleave at four thirty\n\n<$A>  You leave at what time\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  What\n\n<$B> \n\n What time do you leave work\n\n<$A>  Oh you leave work at four thirty\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  Oh\n Okay\n I can understand I think\n\n<$B>  Uhu\n You mean what\n You thought

life like living on campus\n\n<$B> \n\nthere<,>\n\n when I\n\ncame on campus really was   one attempt  to\n\nget uhm a first class honours uhm degree<,>\n Uh which meant that I was trying to get eight or nine As out of my\n\nlast ten courses<,>\n\n\nuhm<,>\n moved on\n\n   I<,> thought I was at study\n\ncamp\n\n\no  outside of schoolwork<,> cos I had\n\nschoolwork I had to work<,> part- time<,> and I had\n\nchurch activities and I had all sort  of other volunteer things so\n\n  I didn't want to get involved in anything  \n\nelse<,>\n created problems with some people down there\n\ninitially uhm you know\n\n\nand so few men and it was a problem but<,> over time    I got involved   and because one of the\n\nguys Dave  , who was the elected sports rep  \n deal with it\n I\n\ndecided to step in since I've had a few <w> years'<w>\n\nexperience<,> doing sports administration coaching teams\n\n  coaching myself<,> and organising stuff  \n\nuhm<,>\n was an easy\n\ntransition for me<,>   uhm and now  \n\nover time  you know    you got more\n\ninvolved   more  and more till I started doing things\n\nfor the hall and stuff\n\n\npressuring<,> uhm well from my side<,>\n have been\n\npressuring cos some nights there was no sleep really<,>\n the night\n\n\nat five o'clock and then you come back up for school  ,\n\nleave from school to work\n\n\n<,> uhm<,> especially in the first semester<,>\n just\n\ntired uhm so I couldn't do some of the things that\n\nI used to do<,>   like only work after one hour's sleep\n\nwithin   uhm  a two-day period or  \n\nsomething like that\n Uhm\n\n\n<,> uhm<,> and in actual fact it was my first year doing like sports on\n\ncampus<,>\n my first years I didn't do it because uhm I was\n\nattached to Irvine Hall<,> and   when \n\nI went to football training I didn't think   \n\nthey were as uhm   organised   \n\nas I wanted them to be   alright<,>\n You know because like I said I used to coach my own\n\nteams<,> and so I knew exactly what I was looking\n\nfor<,>\n just\n\nstopped\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mhm\n\n\n<$A>

\n\n<$A>  What kind of things were you looking for\n\n<$B> \n\nfor I wanted signs then    of that the\n\npersons organising the thing  , that they knew exactly \n\n what they were doing<,>\n Uhm so how would that be demonstrated\n\n uh well of some\n\nsort<,>\n\nw  with an agenda\n You know exactly what you're doing\n\n\ntowards<,>\n in a situation where you\n\nneed to get uniforms and not necessarily jerseys per   se but\n\nuniform   something to have the team looking like a\n\nteam<,> uhm in the proper colours and stuff\n and\n\nthen when we're coming to work the thing that turned me off was that    when I came the day<,> the guy who was\n\nsupposedly the coach<,> he<,> was\n\njoking uhm really<,> you know uhm \n\n  in Jamaican language what we would say is that him\n\n  shif-man and then uhm   when the guy\n\nwanted to return the favour   so to speak  he blew\n\noff the training<,>   just like that\n it\n\nwasn't serious as far as I was   concerned and it's\n\nan issue that I had before<,>\n Uhm once I was supposed to play in this inter-church\n\ncompetition<,>\n An intra-church competition sorry it was within the whole church\n\ngroup<,>\n pass through the training session\n\nthey only had like four people and they didn't seem to\n\nknow what they were doing\n And so I decided I wasn't going to be a part of this\n\n\n and a few other guys they brought it up in this<,>\n\nleader's meeting cos I used to lead stuff   in the\n\nchurch and stuff\n\n\nspeaker-A-laughsbut at that time   was some high intense\n\nleadership   planning to go into ministry them type of things\n Uhm and a lot of talk about how I was being selfish and stuff like\n\nthat<,>\n Uhm so I eventually said I was going to be a part of\n\nit<,> but as you might expect on my\n\nterms<,> so one of the guys he said he was there and some\n\nothers came and started bossing them around<,> which was\n\nme\n I simply came and said\n This is what we're doing that that that that that\n\n training programmes\n\nwe had    our schedule knew exactly what our\n\nuniforms are going   to be<,> and we never spent any money\n\nbut we simply knew that we're gonna get cos we all volunteered for the school\n\nHope Polo Ride<,>\n we're\n\ngonna use the Hope shirt<,>\n so all you know\n\n cos\n\nwe decided to go full black the next year\n and printed the\n\nnumbers on it\n from\n\nsomebody\n dealt with that\n\n\ncos I live near downtown actually I\n\nlive in downtown   really\n Uhm got the shirts and told the lady I don't want any sleeves on\n\nthem<,> T-shirts and then I took it to  \n\n their football place Art and Fabric and   printed\n\nthe numbers on it<,>\n Uh everybody got their own black shorts and uhm well everybody got\n\ntheir own black socks<,> and foot wear\n And we worked

even last night\n\nI was thinking about it   \n\nit's part of my up-bringing   where my father uhm being\n\nthe first child   one and for a while and being the only boy in\n\nthe household really cos I have a brother my father has a son   with\n\nanother woman\n grew up with\n\nus and  he doesn't live with us\n pass through from time to\n\ntime<,>\n\n\nagain so  <-> I it's</- >  it's still the older sisters\n\nand me      to\n\nget certain things done<,>\n And like I was saying how I was brought up was that I was\n\nresponsible pretty much for certain aspectsof uhm the running\n\nof the place<,>\n So even last night if he wanted he would lay in the bed and wanted\n\nme to ensure that everything was done outside and that    he can lock up the   place\n\nso to speak in quotation marks

that\n\n\n<$A>  It's parts of your personality then\n\n\n<$B>  uhm look uh the thing is I never grew up\n\nwith a lot of help with schoolwork and all of   them stuff\n\nmyself\n have\n\ndeveloped a go-get-it   attitude   alright a\n\ntake-charge type of   attitude if I see a need for\n\nit<,>\n run after\n\ntitles<,> and responsibility toobecause with the\n\nresponsibility    you're talking\n\ntime<,> you know  <-> and</- >  and stuff like\n\nthat\n take\n\non a lot of things\n My plate is as full as it is now\n Uhm but then if I see a situation where and you look around and\n\nthere's no one else it's gotta be you<,> and at that point I\n\nwould be more than willing<,> to step up to the plate so to\n\nspeak   and uhm do my thing\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>

on\n\nuniversity business for exams to Nassau Barbados and Trinidad for the medical\n\nexams and for other exams\n I make arrangements for the deputy subsistence accommodation\n For external examiners coming to Jamaica from all over I do the same\n pay for the ticket pre-pay\n\nticket or if it is a  courier ticket I'll send it by courier\n Uhm then that takes a whole lot because a lot of times there are\n\nchanges\n They always want changes\n So there's a lot of backing and forthing\n I have to send them their itinerary\n They have to approve it and they tell me if it's okay then we serve\n\nticket\n\n\nticket\n\n\nthe university I have to be sure that I don't do anything to waste \n\nthe university's money<,>\n That's the tickets\n And then I do procurement of the office equipment and supplies for\n\nmy office and for any section of the Registry<,>   Morning\n the Registry kitchen\n Uhm I have to buy a fridge stove kettles cups and saucers glasses\n\n\nd got new covers made for the kitchen\n take the best one\n the ceramic\n\ntiles are cracking<,> in the kitchen\n\n I will have to get an estimate to get them repaired replaced and\n\nrepaired\n all of them\n Some of the doors over there need fixing as well but the university\n\n   has financial constraints so I have to wait\n\nuntil the new budget before I'd order this<,>\n And then I supervise the office attendants in the mail room and the\n\noffice attendants in the kitchen\n ladies in the\n\nkitchen<,> they serve tea and coffee\n\nto various sections and they serve the meetings that are held in the council\n\nroom and the conference room  , \n\none<,>\n The office attendants in the mail room collect mail and the various\n\nsections at the Registry and Bursary<,> deliver it all over\n\ncampus and then into the hospital\n to do their job they ask me\n\nbicycle  will ride so I have to book bicycle or approve payment to fix\n\nbicycles<,> uhm or  <- > approves  approve\n\nor doing other supplies with them like tea and coffee and toilet paper and so\n\nand so\n Uhm if there are any complaints from anybody of any room the mail\n\nroom they're serving not the tea uhm I get the complaints and I  \n\nhave to make sure that I deal with it\n\n visiting uhm dignitaries to the\n\nuniversity\n Chancellor vice-chancellor any ministers of government coming for\n\nuniversity meetings I meet them and see them off\n So that entails me working before office hours after office hours\n\nand then Saturdays and Sundays<,>\n Uhm other sections sometimes ask me to meet people not the Registry\n\nbecause    I have a pass that can go into the airport\n\ninto various section  of the airport and since the increased\n\nsecurity awareness\n\nstopped\n I also have to uhm this office makes bookings for the council\n\nroom<,> and if the council room needs any kind of repairing\n\nor fixing I have to do it\n I have to book microphones and taping for meetings cos if the\n\nmeetings are over twenty-five people I get microphones and if there're\n\nsecretaries taking minutes    there's a young\n\nman who comes from electrical and he records<,> big tape\n\nrecorder   and    tapes the\n\nmeeting\n So the secretary in addition to her notes uses the tapes to write\n\nminutes\n meetings\n I have to get lunch and coffee break for them\n Make sure that if they need flowers outside the room or inside the\n\nroom I get flowers\n\n\nto use anybody's table cloths\n So sometimes I just order the food nothing else\n The ladies from the kitchen serve the tea and sandwiches and cake\n\nor pastry or fruit whatever I order\n I decide what to order\n this is not gonna take twenty minutes\n I book cars for people who come from other campuses for instance\n\n   the principal and the deputy principal from Cave\n\nHill and Saint Augustine are entitled to cars rental cars\n So their office will call e-mail or fax me and say\n Book the car\n Then I call the car rental place and they will book the car and\n\nsend me a  pro forma invoice of the costs\n\n\nthey can get payment\n I send it over to customer service bursary\n Uhm sometimes other people who want to rent cars while they're here\n\nand they pay they also call me to make the booking for\n\nthem<,>\n can call and we have\n\n   a complicated deal with some island tours who if\n\npeople want to be picked up not drive but picked up I arrange with them\n\nMister  Miller and he will pick them up and carry them to the airport\n\nsend me a bill and I have to   \n\nwrite up a purchase requisition as well and send it    so he can get

of vehicle\n rental\n\ncar company will decide what kind of vehicle  , and because\n\nthey change their vehicles every two years<,>    the kind of vehicle change\n So one year they might get a Honda Accord the next year they might\n\nget a Daewoo Leganza which is identical in size car but just made differently\n\n it's from a different company\n Or for instance I rent a car for the chancellor\n Toyota uhm a new Toyota\n\nCamry\n It's a two thousand and three Camry\n It's a nice car\n\n\ntheir current top of the line car<,>   \n\nthe Camry\n I mean they also rent vans and busses and so\n But we only book cars\n So when the principal\n Then they have a record at the rental car company anyway what car\n\nthe person took<,> the last time and so if they have any problem\n\nthey would note it and    make a note on their\n\nfiles that    the principal from Cave Hill Professor\n\n Williams he wants    a Camry or whatever and\n\nthey write it<,>\n we give\n\nthem you know a bit of business   so we get a ten percent\n\ndiscount<,>\n You know\n Uhm normally the university have a car that the chancellor used to\n\nuse but that car  met an accident so there is no car now so that's why\n\nI have to rent a car for the chancellor\n university car and the university but\n\nanyway I rent the car and    there's a\n\ndriver attached to  <- > maintenance  maintenance\n\ntransport<,> and he drives\n So when I put a meeting if it's in the night he comes to my house\n\nand picks me up because I don't want to drive out to the airport in the night\n So he picks me up and I go with them\n\n\nintrude you know\n Not that I'm going to respond if they're talking to themselves in\n\nthe back but    I maybe they want to <unclear>\n\nword</unclear> talk personal things and I don't need

three months or so\n\nbecause is difficult to keep ordering everything<,> you know \n\n  it takes up your time and then I go to stores and pick\n\nthem up<,> cos if stores deliver they charge you the <unclear>\n\nword</unclear> eight hundred dollars just to come from maintenance to here\n pick it up\n because uhm everybody's budget\n\nis cut so I have make sure that my budget is not finished\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n So uhm could you tell me some of the ways in which uh the budget\n\ncut has affected the Registry\n\n<$B>  uhm\n the budget cut has\n\naffected the registry is thatthe money is finished\n\n what we are assigned for the\n\nyear is finished\n Therefore we have to find ways to not spend as much as we used to\n And I don't see how we going to do that fix it in terms of the\n\nprocurement and the things that we buy\n the way the money\n\ngoes<,> is through supplies for the kitchen\n So it's basically coffee and tea and soap and toilet paper and uh\n We have to order lots of things because the bursary staff is over\n\na hundred people and  I mean the Registry must be about the same\n So you're talking supplies for over two hundred people\n the people coffee you can't do that\n have to get their coffee\n When they have meetings the meetings have be to served\n\n\ndecide that the meetings no longer need to be served and we just give\n\nthem water\n And I don't know\n ice machine\n\nneeds to be serviced\n\n\nhas a filter\n to be serviced\n They have a filter you can see when it's dirty\n clear glass\n\nthing<,> and you see the spots on it\n impurities in\n\nthe water are filtered out through the filter and then made ice\n can see it\n\n Uhm\n Nothing else I don't think\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<-> the

affecting staff<,>\n employ any new\n\npeople and if you're a temporary when   \n\nyour time is up<,> you might just leave and    your time hasn't extended\n I don't know\n about that\n\nhas been made yet cos    all I've been telling people is to\n\nmake sure that they don't waste anything\n For instance the people in the kitchen\n pour out\n\nmilk in a jug and sugar in a container\n I say make sure you pick up the things right after so if the milk\n\nis left it doesn't spoil\n Put it in the fridge so you can use it to make tea the next\n\nmorning\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A>  would like to ask you a few questions about your\n\ndiscipline\n\n<$B>  So ask me\n\n<$A>  proceed by telling me what linguistics is about\n\n<$B>  Well basically linguistics uhm entails a lot of different\n\nthings\n It draws on different subject areas\n But for the most part I guess a general definition would be the\n\nscience of language\n\n\nbest explain if I'm to give you an idea of what exactly we do\n We have various branches such as sociolinguistics where what we look\n\nat is how languages behave on a societal level with regards to how humans are\n\nable to use language in political arenas in economic arenas and so forth and\n\nso on in normal correspondence with each other\n We also have an area such as neurolinguistics where we find out how\n\nthe brain is able to uhm produce or send the information for that matter to\n\nthe motory you know areas of the body the lips in production of utterances\n\nthat are used you know to communicate\n We have various branches each of which you know come together to\n\ncreate what it is that we know as linguistics\n\n<$A>  Okay\n pursue linguistics as uh an\n\narea of study how would you break it down to such a person as  \n\n in layman terms<,>\n\n<$B>  Well I suppose the first thing we'd have to do is kind of let\n\nthem understand what exactly they'd be doing\n So for example we have a course uh that I have done in my first\n\nyear L fourteen A\n It was an introductory course where we look at what types of\n\ncommunication there are right\n Looking at from animal communication sign language that type of\n\nthing\n And getting an understanding of communication we then look at how\n\nhumans communicate with regards to spoken language and how this has various\n\nsounds and how these sounds have various meanings\n So I suppose what one would have to do is first uhm let the\n\nindividual get an understanding of this\n in first a\n\ntheoretical way and then show them the practical side of things\n So I said let them understand exactly what is going on\n In so doing they kind of get a grasp of you know the little\n\nintricacies before they really go deep into the other areas of linguistics\n\n<$A>  Okay\n So as a student of this discipline what do you enjoy most about it\n\n<$B> Well it really depends uhm for example I can\n\nprofess that I was once very fond of syntax however until    L thirty B sorry advanced\n\nsyntax I become somewhat jaded\n Uhm there is also phonology\n Phonology to some extent was fun you know learning about the\n\ndifferent sounds of language the different meanings attached to them\n How individuals would string these sounds together to create\n\nmeaningful utterances and so on\n couldn't necessarily say that there\n\nis one set thing that I enjoy\n I'd say that there're different branches and there're little\n\nintricate things from each that you know    I\n\nreally enjoy\n For the most part however one thing that has kinda held me for some\n\ntime was actually the whole thing of uhm computational linguistics which it's\n\nnot necessarily offered here but I have been doing some research online\n\n\nhave been uhm <unclear> word</unclear>\n And for the most part I'd say that if I had to definitely choose an\n\narea that I love I'd say had I been exposed to that I think that would be my\n\narea    of most interest<,,>\n\n<$A>  doing\n\nlinguistics\n\n<$B>  Well it's usually a misconception by some of the individuals\n\non this campus for example those persons in social sciences and so on that\n\nlinguistics is merely just a study of you know languages\n So the first thing they'll ask you is\n How many different languages do you speak\n However yes there you can look at languages and you know do a type\n\nof linguistics that allows you to actually speak different languages because\n\nyou get a you know grasp of these languages on a structural basis\n However some of the problems that one really face that I have faced\n\nin the past really was the fact that    you\n\nhave to do a whole lot of reading and<,> not only do you have to do a\n\nwhole lot of reading but you have to understand the material\n And one of the problems that I myself usually face and a few of my\n\ncolleagues is pretty much the degree to which some of these linguists have\n\nwritten their papers\n yourselves sometimes\n\nreading an article three four five different times before you fully grasp\n\neven a section of    or even grasp exactly what\n\nthey're saying\n However when you do grasp it you feel a sense of\n\naccomplishment<,> but for the most part I'd say<,>\n\nthat is where    you really get a lot of the\n\nchallenge trying to understand the concepts trying to put this into your own\n\nyou know trying to get your own idea of what is being said  <,>    to apply it in your own way\n That is where I think the biggest challenge comes in\n Uhm separate and apart from that it's an exciting field many\n\npossibilities\n\n\nthink    it makes for a very good career path\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n So tell me about your lecturers\n\n\nof linguistics\n\n<$B>  Uh each individual approaches it in a slightly different way\n teach in a way\n\nthat I like to refer to as baby\n They will carry you step by step you know explaining a few of the\n\nintricacies showing you what to read telling you the exact sections\n However there are some who believe that well babying is not the way\n\nto you know allow you to learn\n\n\n<$A>  thing or is it a good thing\n\n<$B>  Well I believe that each teacher's method works in its own\n\nway<,> in the sense that I believe that there is some level of\n\nbabying that is needed\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n However at the same time I believe when you reach a certain level\n\nlike you know you should take things in stages   like for\n\ninstance first year cos   you know  you're\n\ngetting that transition from high school some individuals from college but\n\nsome from high school into university and it's very difficult<,>\n\ncos    the degree of work the level at which you\n\nhave to perform<,> is extremely different so there's a lot of\n\npressure\n good\n\nbut at the same time as you you know move to more advanced levels then \n\n  I believe you should also be allowed to go out there\n\nand now think on your own<,>\n who\n\nteaches in a very interesting way\n He provides you with the information gives you a few ideas as to\n\nwhat you should probably try and look for and then leaves you in the dark\n\nwith a candle to find your way to some form of light<,>\n It's an interesting method\n Sometimes we get lost along the way but in the end having figured\n\nout the thing by yourself you kind of feel a sense of accomplishment\n find that\n\neach teacher  <- > has you know  will have their own method\n\nand if utilised properly and   I think  it\n\nalso depends on the student themselves   also\n\n\n  you know  have to have that drive that\n\ndesire to learn to grasp what is going on\n is there\n\ncoupled with you know what the teacher is providing them there shouldn't be a\n\nproblem\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n\n that you actually do    in the\n\ndiscipline\n some of\n\nthe major ones\n\n<$B>  Well as a linguistics major firstly you know uhm well in\n\ncoming in in first year   the first thing  you'll\n\nactually do is L fourteen A\n And what this is is just a basic introduction to what linguistics\n\nis\n\n\ninstance what you do in second semester\n This being L ten A L ten B where you now go into you know you\n\nbranch off into various sections   ten A being\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  A is an introduction to phonology\n And what phonology really is is the science of you know what you\n\nlook at is sounds and how sounds are put together to produce you know what\n\nyou hear whenever we speak\n We look at the articulatory uhm organs so for example the lips the\n\ntongue the teeth and how these are used in the production of these sounds\n\n\n you know  there's a universal principle that being\n\nhuman allows you to produce all the sounds of the world\n However as a child growing up in various environments you will now\n\nselect the ones that are suited for your you know language<,>\n So as you grow older however the ability to produce the other\n\nsounds   you know you  do develop these\n uhm if I remember\n\ncorrectly  it's more a look at uh either morphology or syntax\n I'm not quite sure this being my third year\n a look at both I should\n\nsay actually\n Just have a brief introduction where you learn about how these\n\nsounds are now strung together in what are referred to as morphemes\n sense of how things are\n\nproduced how things move from the brain to actual production and how they are\n\nnow interpreted by a hearer\n moving up to second year now\n That is where you start getting a little bit more in\n\ndepth<,>\n You'll end up doing something which is referred to as L twenty A\n\nthis being phonology\n where it\n\nstarts getting really interesting\n There are a few concepts that at first really boggle the mind\n You find yourself sometimes doing three to five hours uhm you know\n\nfor reading outside of the classroom trying to work out you know different\n\npatterns that are given to you trying to work out the homework   so as  to better get a grasp of what is going on\n Uh we also have L twenty B which is uh syntax\n And again this is where things get really interesting\n new topics such as X bar\n\ntheory<,> which is a very very interesting topic<,>\n Intricately\n Uhm you know you we learn\n And one of things that I liked about twenty B was we were able to\n\nuse some of what we had learnt   you know  in\n\napplication in looking at different languages\n So you'd learn for example that some languages are S V\n\nO<,> where you know they have the   subject the  <->\n\n<- >object right S O\n\nV<,> and you know so forth and so on\n You learn about uhm the fact that in some\n\nlanguages you only have a consonant followed by\n\na vowel<,> in others you may have   you know \n\nC V C consonant vowel consonants and so on\n You learn the different restrictions in these\n\nlanguages<,>\n You get an idea of what you know can come syntactically following\n\nfrom the next thing following from the next thing what will be you know a\n\nimproper or ungrammatical form\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>

basically a sign parking to workers and they wouldn't\n\nhave two waiting areas    but most of the time they\n\nare filled so and they like insist that they have to park there<,>\n So\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n Yes\n\n<$A>  So uhm this is the area you work all the time\n\n<$B>  Well first I used to work like on the Halls but they've\n\ntransferred me over this side\n\n<$A>  What was working on the Halls like\n\n<$B>  not bad you know because working on the Halls was\n\nbasically like you have a visiting hours like from eight till one in the\n\nnight so normally when visitors come before you log them

do<,>\n Uhm you have to do P twenty-four F which is signals and\n\nsystems<,> uhm that's as I said is very mathematical-based\n I don't know how I got to\n\ndo it cos I didn't have  <-> any</- >  any

eight<,> so<,> now I'm learning math<,> at the\n\nsame time<,> trying to learn the electronics<,> but after\n\nit's basically you have to really<,> once you learn the concept<,> it becomes\n\nmuch easier<,> and when you have friends and the lecturers\n\n   in electronics department they at least the\n\nlecturers in the physics department<,> they're very helpful\n You definitely can talk to them

year\n Uhm I've spoken to a lot of people who seem to think that uhm these\n\naren't negative moves that are being taken by the government because this\n\nuniversity has uhm for a number of years the

context\n Number one\n sort of comments\n\nright\n I have heard those comments myself and I've heard them often and\n\nwhat I point out is that those comments come largely from two sets of people\n had to set foot\n\nthrough the gates of this campus and therefore do not know what it is like to\n\nhave to be studying and to have to be worrying about how you're gonna be\n\npaying your fees\n\n\n  success here must be compromised if you have\n\nto be spending so much of your time what not focussing   \n\non your studies but rather worrying how you're going to pay for what\n\nyou're studying for\n set of people now and\n\nthis is these    are the ones that peeve me the most\n Some of the greatest critics of this thing are the very same ones\n\nwho came here and benefited from it while it was free while it was completely\n\nfree and now all of a sudden now that they came here at a time when only very\n\nfew people could come here and they came here and enjoyed the benefits of it\n\nwhile it was free and they are happy and relaxed and comfortable in their\n\njobs and are financially secure and they're running off their mouth and\n\nsaying whatever they want\n Well some of them are still in certain jobs somewhere and some of\n\nthem have their contacts    and thing\n So some of them will be quite alright and quite comfortable\n\n\nb  gets to a point where the tuition where the costs that\n\nstudents have to pay to attend this place gets any higher than it is now it\n\nis going to return<,> to where it    was\n\nbefore    in terms of being  \n\n an elitist

those thing like\n\nscare the crap out of me so\n\n\nhave fun not uhm thinking that I probably will be gunned down or\n\nanything<,>\n we uhm being in\n\nSaint Elizabeth we preserve our culture than in Kingston\n we\'re\n\nexposed to a lot of stuff beyond our culture\n Ya\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  At what age you moved to Saint Elizabeth\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Alright you\'re

uhm the UWI students\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Mhm mhm\n Well it\'s pretty much similar you know a lot of freaky\n\npeople<,> very freaky<,> uhm the whole uhm gay\n\nlesbian  bisexual <unclear> words</unclear> so\n Yeah\n So it\'s pretty much similar although I have those in Saint\n\nElizabeth I can probably say this\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n if you\n\nshould choose<,> between<,> living in Kingston<,>  \n\n  or  living in Saint Elizabeth which  \n\n do you choose<,,>\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Uhm it\'s kind of hard to choose because well I prefer Saint\n\nElizabeth but like<,> career-wise there is nothing in Saint Elizabeth to do\n\nstill\n So I would choose Kingston in that aspect\n culture and nature Saint Elizabeth\n\ndefinitely\n\n<$A>  So why you choose to look something to do instead of actually\n\n , making or creating some employment\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  I\'ve often thought about it but like if I should do\n\nthat in Saint Elizabeth you know how people get especially black people\n They kind of like beat down and get not wanting it to reach\n\nanywhere so it can be very difficult to get their stuff done\n\n So if you don\'t have customers you can\'t get\n\nanywhere <$A>So\n\nyou say you\'d prefer<,> to live in Kingston or you\'d   prefer to live\n\nin\n\n<$B>  but like\n\n<$A>  in\n\ncreating employment\n\n<$B>  creating employment you need people\'s support\n And if they don\'t want to support you how you going to get through\n\nin life you know<,>\n\n<$A> \n\n employment for   yourself\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n capitalism approach of life\n Rich will always be richer and

uhm how important\n\nyou think<,> your<,> university social life is\n\nto your wider development\n\n<$B>  to be honest here\n\nI only have like people I par with\n You know you can\'t get through life without talking to people\n I guess that\'s the reason why I really talk to most of them\n apart from that it\'s not that important to my outer\n\ndevelopment\n within people or friends\n\n<$A>  be\n\nsuccessful  <- > in  in business is to\n\nreally<,> know people know a lot of people who<,> can pull\n\nstring for you   and uhm so on and because of the fact that \n\n  at the university you have people who are\n\nfrom a<,> number of different background and have a  \n\n lot of different connections and thing\n with\n\nsuch people then you have a better chance\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Well to be honest probably\n Well I\'ve been around people and they\'re not that helpful in\n\npulling me anywhere\n\n\n from people outside like family and people I\'ve known before\n\nthose links that people I just met coming to university\n\n<$A> \n\n your social life doesn\'t really impact greatly on uhm your wider\n\ndevelopment\n\n<$B>  No\n There\'s a little yeah impact but not that much of an impact\n\n<$A>  Okay\n So what about intimate relationships\n\n<$B>  Here on campus\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  Well I\'ve never been in an intimate relationship with anybody\n\ncoming to UWI thus far<,>\n So\n\n<$A>  What you don\'t see any of them you\'re attracted to\n\n<$B> \n\nbut<,>  but they\'re just not genuine\n\n<$A>  Oh they pretend that they like you and they don\'t really like\n\nyou\n\n<$B>  Well not in that case still but well probably I have the old\n\nway of<,> looking on things like relationships and stuff and uh their way of\n\nrelationship is just not my way just  you know link because they\'re\n\ninto the whole  deeper woman thing their woman men and it just don\'t\n\nwork for me\n\n<$A> \n\nprobably  <- > four<,,>  four girl who is faithful and is\n\ncommitted to\n And uhm another man who only has one female and the female sleep\n\nwith other men or he\'s like going around the corner and sleeping with another\n\nwoman\n\n<$B> fuck around relationship I\n\nguess\n\n\nfaifaithful and then well knowing woman still<,> they\'re\n\nnot going to agree with that\n that\'s\n\nwhat   that\'s what I\'ve heard that Rastas should\n\nhave many wives and these wives will comply to whatever is taking\n\nplace\n But like us the non-Rastafaris no it just don\'t work\n\n\n<$A>  Okay\n So uhm you\'re in a relationship at the moment intimate\n\nrelationship\n\n<$B>  Yes\n I would say intimate\n\n<$A>  How is it\n\n<$B>  It\'s going great cos so far he has not been testing me about\n\nthis love thing cos whenever I hear the word " love" I\n\nalways run<,>\n Don\'t know why\n\n I hate when people get in too deep in a relationship like they\'re\n\nlosing theirself and everything cos they always scare me\n\n<$A>  a\n\nlasting

level<,> grade two to the sixth grade\n\n<$A>  Do you\n\n<$A>  Oh do you like uhm teaching at primary level\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Just no\n like it\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nschool and work and the things I'm doing    at\n\nschool<,> they are not being reflected at work because   now    at the level at\n\nschool I'm doing  I don't seem to be  sure in\n\nwhatever I'm doing<,> so\n And I hate to teach babies\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n What is that\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Marketing\n\n<$A>  Marketing\nWhat are you doing now that is preparing you for a\n\nlife in marketing\n\n<$B>  and hopefully when\n\nI'm finished with my degree I'll  try to have a diploma\n\n<$A>  recently that you\n\nfound out you didn't like teaching      or\n\ndid you always know this\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  No\n Not recently\nrecording-\n\ninterrupted-continued a college that was you could board you could live\n\non so I decided to go but    it has paid\n\noff you know<,> it has paid off\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  uhm what made you do linguistics\n\nthen\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And you don't plan to use this in any practical way outside of\n\nuhm the discipline    or in your teaching\n\nprofession<,,>\n\n<$A>  So you're a teacher\n Do you have any children\n\n<$B>  No I don't\n\n<$A>  You don't have any children\n Is it something that you're looking forward to considering that\n\nyou're surrounded by two-graders every day\n\n<$B>  Uhm no I'm not looking forward to it\n\n<$A>  You're not\n So you don't plan to have any children\n\n<$B>  if\n\na child does come along<,> it's accepted\n\n<$A>  Okay\n Uhm as a student of this university you've been here for uh how\n\nlong now\n\n<$B>  Three years\n\n<$A>  are your impressions on\n\nthe services that are being offered here\n I know a lot of people say the university does not give back enough\n\nto the wider society\n do you feel about that\n\n<$B> \n I am not much into the university at the moment because I'm\n\npart-time and I don't have the time    to look at\n\nwhat the committee is doing outside\n\n There's a problem I have though with the university in terms of\n\npart-time\n There're courses that I want do because I'm part-time and I can't\n\nget to do it because   of the time they're offered\n think they cater well for part-time students\n\n<$A \n\n<$A \n\n<$A \n\n<$A  Okay\n\n<$B>  That's what I mean basically\n\n<$A> \n\nby offering more courses that's the only way that you think they could \n\n help\n\n<$B>  the courses at a later time in the\n\nafternoon\n\n<$A>  Okay\n something else that\n\nmight be affecting you is that    there's\n\nnow this big thing about budget cuts<,> that would be\n\naffecting the university and maybe have an impact   \n\non your  uhm courses as well\n Do you think that budget cuts will be affecting you and do you\n\nthink that it's a good thing for the university    to\n\nbe uhm tightening up because they've been accused    of wasting so much\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n indirect\n\nright now<,>\n I'm not around to see the university wasting money\n I don't know what they spend their money on because I have to pay\n\nmy school fee I have to pay for every material I get here<,>\n So they don't cater for me in any way at all\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\ndon't \n Uhm let's talk about something else outside of the university then\n Uhm as a female a woman in this country what do you think are the\n\nmajor issues    that are challenges    that women face today\n\n<$B>  Single women\n\n<$A> \n\nmarried women uh all women<,,>\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  have\n\nincomes are smaller and<,> to provide for a child it's not easy\n\nespecially when some parents go for<,> a single parent go for to send their\n\nchild to a prep school it's quite expensive and   I think \n\nit's better <unclear> words</unclear> again a good education for their kids you know at\n\nan  <- > expensive  expensive so career- driven and it takes up most of\n\ntheir time\n They don't have time for their kids\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  government and in\n\nparticular the section of the government that's responsible for\n\neducation that uhm considering the\n\nlanguage situation that exist in the country today that that is a major\n\nproblem    in schools one of understanding uhm\n\nconsidering that a lot of children come into the primary school  \n\nwithout a<,> with different language backgrounds\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yes it pose a problem\n It pose a lot of problems because even uhm Spanish you know Spanish\n\n   is taught in most uhm prep schools<,>\n\nand I'm expecting children at that age or to see that children that age you\n\nknow they will grasp quicker than any other than adults do at that age and\n\nbecause of the homes they are coming from you realise that they are not\n\n\nspoken at home so<,> they don't do well in Spanish   and   well   they don't apply they don't \n\n, \n you teach\n\nthis and they still speak that way<,>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nunderstanding what is being taught\n\n<$B>  Well I think they're confused\n One thing at home one thing on the road one thing over there and\n\nanother thing at school\n\n Unless the home is a home where you know English is taught you\n\nknow or it's spoken there\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Well I think they may be confused\n\n<$B> \n\nword</unclear>\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n\n<$B>  Be more specific\n\n<$A>  Which parish\n\n<$B>  Saint Mary\n\n<$A>  Oh you're from Saint Mary\n Where abouts in Saint Mary\n\n<$B>  Little London\n\n<$A>  Oh okay\n the best\n\nthing that Saint Mary has to offer\n\n\nyou're you know in Kingston but is it some place that you would go back\n\nto live\n What is it that you love about Saint Mary\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n Oh really\n There isn't thing\n\n<$B> \n I spent three years in Portland and I prefer Portland to Saint\n\nMary\n\n<$A>  Saint Mary has some really\n\nnice  <- >   you   know places along the\n\ncoast\n\n<$B>  Like what\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n I've never been to Saint Mary\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  very pretty\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yes it is but Portland has a more attractive one\n\n<$A>  hm\n Uhm but by way like in development what do you think can be done\n\n   to better market Saint\n\nMary\n Like the country now has like a facing a lot of\n\neconomic<,> yes and pressures and problems the gas price\n\nconstantly going up you know<,> our money falling we're living on the edge\n\n and not   changing and everything else on a rise cost of\n\nliving\n\n\n  politicians should be doing about it\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  The government wasting our money\n\n<$B>  They want to build a new parliament building no parliament\n\noffice uhm\n building for\n\nmembers of parliament\n\n<$A>  I didn't even know that\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  No\n\n<$B> \n\nthe members of parliament can have  they can have their offices\n\ntheir   I think it's  a new one or it's    one of the old ones  you\n\nknow\n\n<$A>  What's wrong with the\n Shouldn't the members of parliament's offices be in their\n\nconstituencies<,> so that uhm   the\n\npeople in  the constituency   can have access to \n\n them\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  it should be\n I think yeah but to build a main building for them\n\n I don't\n Do you see it that way\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n\nyou think the government is our major problem   right now\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  everything is totally\n\nbad about   them no but there are some things that you have to bash\n\nand some things that you have to say yeah about but\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mhm\n\n\npr  produce any major difference\n\n<$B>  I was of the opinion that once that young heads are better\n\nbut I don't know<,>\n I don't know so I might wanna see a change from the older to the\n\nyounger people\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Uhu\n\n\n<- > the  the crime rate uhm specifically all I know a lot of\n\npeople think that uhm<,>\n is a cause\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  of frustration no jobs available\n\nbecause even some\n\n\nthey<,>  they just finished this year and this <unclear>\n\nwords</unclear>version means and you hear no\n at\n\nall no call to say nobody have a good chance<,>\n There are no jobs available\n it's not\n\nonly affecting the people who are<,> not educated but those who are\n\n  educated<,>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  as well\n\n<$A>  Uhm do you think we will get to a point where uhm uhm like\n\n   a what happened in Haiti the other\n\nday could happen here<,>\n any time\n\nsoon\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n I hope not\n\n<$A>  Yeah I hope not as well\n\n So uhm we were talking about linguistics and uhm you face some\n\nproblems doing linguistics in this university\n\n<$B>  Well uhm after first year I was de-motivated\n Why because the course weren't fun they weren't exciting they\n\ndidn't give me any drive\n\n\nyou're expecting  <,,>  the courses to\n\nbe you know  <,>  have something pulling\n\nto do them right now\n\n\ncourses like L twenty A and L twenty B and I recall coming to labs\n\nafter a    couple lab sessions<,>\n\nand<,> I don't think a practical work was done<,> enough practical work was\n\ndone in the lab<,> for me to understand    what was done<,><,>\n because you're\n\ninside the classroom and all you do is make sounds\n You don't see what the sounds are\n Yes you can say

I thought too because before I got into the\n\nprogramme I was told that it was a very difficult programme<,> but\n\nI am coping and as I said the grades are better so    I\n\nthink one of the reasons why it's better is because I'm enjoying what\n\nI'm doing\n\n\nnoiseso    that's one of the reasons why<,>\n\nit's working out well for me\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  it\n\nwhat you applied for   to

got in the econ side of it and then I think in my\n\nsecond semester of the second year I decided to just concentrate on econ\n\nalone\n So that's how I switched to econ\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>

switch to\n\nanything\n\n<$B>  Your decision\n\n Then you come here to do that\n Well it happens for some of us\n do a major because they want a degree\n Some of us do it because we love it\n to get out of\n\nthis place but probably in the middle of it you might get to like that field\n\nand you end up sticking to it for later on\n\n<$A>  job-hunting like after your first\n\ndegree\n\n<$B>  Well it wasn't hard for me because when in my last semester I\n\ngot a part-time job in the Bursary and then from there I was looking for a\n\nfull-time job\n So the manager I was working with was looking for me too and then\n\nhe heard about this one that I'm now in and I applied and I was there\n\npart-time on a three-months probationary basis and then afterwards I was\n\nhired\n So I didn't have one of the typical stories where after school I\n\ncouldn't get a job where it was hard and I had to be job-hunting and sending\n\nresumes here and there\n\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  So how has your job been so far\n\n<$B>  Well I like it\n probably some of\n\nthe other jobs on the outside so I don't mind it\n working at U W I because I'm learning a\n\nlot   as I go along\n it to be a\n\nlearning ground so at the end of the day you should be more improved and\n\nshould have learned something if it is you want to move on from here\n And the job itself as I say is not hard\n It's manageable especially with doing my programme I can manage it\n Uhm I enjoy working with people so the fact that I have to deal\n\nwith students is good for me\n\n\ngood  good experience<,>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  You need to tell us what you do cos uhm people always worry\n\nabout working and doing their masters at the same time\n\n<$B>  funny thing is well when I\n\nfinished coming to college I didn't want to come straight to U W I so I\n\ndecided to work for a year and because I was doing the N one  \n\n at a community college we're let out May just like how here we're\n\nlet out<,> and I had four months\n four months to\n\nfind a job\n\n So I think then was my searching period because I sent resumes here\n\nand there and here and no responses and sometimes   when I\n\nget<,>\n Yes\n So I think I did get that just after community college and I\n\nfinally got a job and did that for a year then came to U W I\n you\n\nhave to  you have to network\n You have to try and get to know a lot of persons especially those\n\nin the management field because they're the ones that's going to help you\n They're the ones that know other persons on the outside\n\n\nanybody apart from those who you went to school with\n So you have to get to know a lot of persons as I said network\n That's the key\n You can't survive without networking\n You can't survive without other people\n So you can't do a lot of things on your own\n You need other persons to help to push you along and to help to get\n\nhere and there\n\n\nJamaica it's a land of name-calling\n It is who you know that will get you somewhere\n So if you go to this organisation and you let them know that listen\n\nI know X and X you'll get the job or you're getting further than if you just\n\ngo there and sit and not knowing anybody\n So you have to do a lot of name-calling and networking to get where\n\nyou want to get\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay I guess that's why every time I've looked for a summer\n\njob   because I've been to places and they said\n\nthey take only certain students that  , each year <unclear>\n\nword</unclear>  that were there\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Right\n at U\n\nW I it is who you know that will get you somewhere\n they\n\ndo is they fill internally\n I mean there's a job available it is somebody from another\n\ndepartment that's going to get the job or it is somebody who somebody in the\n\noffice knows that's going to come in and get the job\n Because they hardly ever depend on people coming from the outside\n\nunless somebody says listen I know this person work with them\n\n\noutside work  outside world works but I know you have to know\n\nsomebody in order to get where you want to get especially in Jamaica\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  even the summer\n\njobs itself you have ten thousand students and most all of them want\n\na summer job\n is employers\n\nare going to know who to choose is because somebody will say to them listen\n\n   I know Mary-Jane so work with her\n Cos if John just walks in it is highly unlikely that they're going\n\nto take him to come on and do the job\n So it's really who you know\n\n<$A>  more persons inside than\n\noutside\n\n<$B>  Well no\n Uhm well since I have been at UWI I have been very active cos I\n\nwas on the Guild and that alone helped me to know a lot of persons in the\n\nmanagement levels here\n We've had to sit with them in meetings et cetera\n So you can't just come here and go to your classes and not do\n\nanything\n You have to be involved especially in co-curricular activities\n If you don't have little time nor a love of co-curricular for as\n\nmuch as somebody who is\n\n Every year you should try to know at least two lecturers because\n\nat the end of the day you might need them for references\n So you have to chat to get to know them\n As the students come here for three years and when they come back\n\nand they need something from their lecturer they say they don't know any of\n\nthe   lecturers and lecturers don't know any of them which is\n\nbad\n You have to know at least two of your lecturers every year so at\n\nthe end you have six lecturers who you can draw on who you can go to and say\n\nlisten I need a reference to get this job cos otherwise you won't be able to\n\nsurvive\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  what\n\nthe problem is is that<,> each semester    you\n\nmight have different lecturers you know so the time period in which\n\nyou   get to know them\n\n<$B> \n\n<-> you might not have</- >  you might be understanding the course\n\nso you feel you don't need to go to the lecturer but just for your sake only\n\nyou need to go to him and say listen my name is X and I'm in your class and\n\nthereafter you just find small items just to go to him and go to\n\n\n\nusually have office hours\n\n\nthat person to know you and when they're marking your things they'd\n\nlook out for you so at the end they're gonna test cos it can't you definitely\n\nwill need the lecturers to prove some amount of recommendation\n If you're applying for the masters programme some of these\n\nlecturers sit on the board that decides who gets into the programme\n So when they see the name they might not remember a lot of stuff\n\nabout you but when they see the name they recognise the name and say oh this\n\nperson was in my class and they usually visit and they you understand so they\n\nuse those things    to decide   \n\non your future\n So you can't just come and say alright I don't have the time or\n\nthe lecturer not important or he will not remember me so I won't be bothered\n You have to get to know at least two of your lecturers\n\n<$A>", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$A>  The year I started as treasurer the Guild was coming out of\n\neverybody should know the Benz raffle scandal\n So we had a lot of debts\n We had a lot of bad name because people said the treasurer alone\n\nsteal the money and the Guild only there to take your money and\n I\n\ndid a good job because I acted you know and I was P R and treasurer\n\nat the same time because the treasurer had resigned in October of the first\n\nsemester so I managed both tasks and then  <- > the second semester uh\n\n the second year I took up the treasurer post\n easy job cos I would recommend that the\n\ntreasurer be a full-time worker because it's not easy to manage the treasurer\n\npost and   school at the sametime\n I put\n\nmyself up to something I'll always fulfill it to the end so I won't get up\n\nand say listen I'm not doing this any more or I won't slack off and say I\n\ndon't have the time\n So I always try to balance both of them\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n\nprobably tight in terms of I never usually let go the money uh events\n\nthat they wanted to have I usually argued just saying no it's not necessary\n\nand we need to save the money here and there\n I had a lot of internal pressure because everybody is only there\n\nfor their portfolio\n So the C U C who's planning events wants at least his million\n\ndollar to do his carnival or to do his this or to do that while the other\n\nperson might want their money to do\n So everybody was pulling and you know I the only one there that say\n\nlisten now we have to conserve there we have to cut back on this\n So there is a lot of internal pressure and then there is the\n\nexternal pressure of the students saying the Guild not going to get any\n\nbetter the treasurer only there stealing money\n So the pressure was from both angles but at the end we came through\n Normally the Guild would leave with a deficit means or negative two\n\nhundred thousand or millions\n This year at the end of my year we came out with over two million\n\ndollars in the kitty\n a big\n\nimprovement and even in my year we got to finalise a financial code which now\n\nshould guide the    guild counsellors and\n\nwould prevent a lot of what was happening before in terms of money being\n\nmisplaced and mismanaged\n So I think yeah it was a good improvement\n we pulled through\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  I've been here for three years and I still do not understand\n\nthe Guild itself in the sense that   \n\nwhere do they come by the money and all those things\n\n\n<$A> \n Well first of all the Guild it's called the Guild of students\n union\n It is the body that should represent the views of the students cos\n\nas you know the principal won't see the ten thousand students<,>\n\nbut if he will sit with nine or so for instance from the executive and\n\ndiscuss matters as it relates to students\n So that's what the Student Guild is there for\n Now the money\n\n\nhun  a thousand something per    for the year<,>\n And that times let's say ten thousand students we get some money\n\noff of that\n Last year the income from guild fees was about thirteen million\n\ndollars<,>\n Yes\n So that was what we used and then we sit at a retreat and allocate\n\n   to the different sections cos you\n\nhave all the executive<,> portfolios who needs money to put on their events\n\nand you have the faculty also who gets money too and you have the hall chairs\n\nwho also gets money<,>\n So the money is split up right across the board depending on the\n\nprogrammes that they bring to the fore\n So you'd allocate money for them programmes that they want to have\n And these programmes are all geared towards the students because of\n\nthe money we're giving back to the students but we put it on in different\n\nprogrammes<,>\n about it\n That's about what the Guild does\n It's just mainly representation\n You have a lot of meetings to attend\n Every day there's another meeting and if it's not a meeting with\n\nadministration it's a meeting with students and bear in mind that all of\n\nthese persons on the Guild are students so while they're meeting they have to\n\ndo their school work and still pass exams like everybody else\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nthe  the students\n their\n\nconcerns and stuff\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n The guild council is of twenty-six persons\n\n\nexecexecutive the regular president vice president\n\nsecretary treasurer that uhm governs the overall council\n And then further you have the hall chairs and their deputies they\n\nsit on the Guild council\n And you have the faculty reps\n figure that if you have so many persons from different\n\nareas you have faculty reps and you have hall chairs\n Some of these persons who are in the faculties live on hall so it's\n\noverlapping there\n So we'll get the information we get the feedback we get the\n\nconcerns from the students through these reps that are on the outside\n And the executive they are usually more known than the others\n\nbecause the hall chairs and faculty reps will be known within their\n\nconstituency while the exec is for everybody\n\n\n  the reps\n These now would sit when they have a council\n\nmeeting sit down and they will share the concerns\n\nand will decide which one we're going to act on we're to decide which one\n Cos you have to choose your battles\n So not every concern of every student will be dealt\n\nwith<,> because you have things that are greater that you have to\n\ndeal with now and that the council considers more urgent than one other issue\n student around the\n\ncorner cussing because this not happening\n There you have to choose your battles and you have to know which\n\none you're going to concentrate on which is what the guild council tries to\n\ndo\n So we do hear the concerns through these representatives\n And also when we have the guild general meetings the student\n\nturnout is low but the few that come they do talk and they tell us the\n\nproblems that they have and from there on we take it from there and represent\n\nso to speak\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  treatment like\n\nfrom the administrative body\n\n<$A>  I don't want to say\n\nbad but it's challenging in that you might have an issue that they might feel\n\nvery strongly about let's say    fees in<,>\n\ntuition fees might be arguing about tuition fees that they say can't increase\n\nbecause students can't pay it or etcetera but they might come with the\n\nargument to say listen we need to increase cos then we need to maintain the\n\nbuildings and we need to do this\n\n\ntug what you call it  <,>  the tug tug\n\nhere so they're pulling we're pulling and<,> at times you sit there and them\n\nall sit in the meetings\n\n\n  the administrator might make statements that<,> not\n\nfit in or you wouldn't expect that from the administrative level but it\n\nhappens because everybody is there and we're representing students they're\n\nrepresenting themselves\n So you always have a lot of pull pull here and there in terms of\n\nwho is representing who\n Uhm there're other times when we go to meetings and both of us\n\nagree on the same thing\n Administration is saying one thing and we're saying the same thing\n\nwhich probably we won't have all the time but we do have that sometimes\n say that\n\nadministration have a lot of respect for the Student Guild\n We sit on all the boards at U W I both here at Mona and on other\n\ntwo campuses\n committees\n\non the boards\n So there is always a voice from the students and I feel like they\n\nhave a    lot of respect for the Student\n\nGuild\n\n<$B>  Okay\n they\n\ndon't like were there any persons that were only there for the  \n\nposition\n\n<$A> \n\n  a two years on the Guild you could probably pick out\n\nprobably a quarter of them or probably as much as half fifty percent<,> who\n\nprobably started out well that came to retreat very vibrant with them issues\n They want to represent and they have these functions they want to\n\nput on just for the student\n But in the middle of it probably because of the pressure probably\n\nbecause listen we're not getting anything out of it cos you don't get\n\nanything\n They probably say listen I don't need to do this\n And they start looking out for themselves and they slack off\n They don't come to meetings\n When they have their portfolio to carry out they don't do anything\n\nwith it\n They have the functions there\n They don't plan it cos you start out at the retreat with one\n\nrepresentative having say five six functions planned and then that money\n\nallocates and at the end of the year  or two   \n\nthey're pulled off because they  done slack off in the middle\n\nof it\n From the outside the Guild seems very easy but when you get into it\n\nit is a lot of work and it is not as easy as those who see it from the\n\noutside\n I remember this guy from Irwin at U W I\n He has been running for a position on the Guild\n And last year as in this year just going out now he finally got a\n\nposition on the Guild and he came to me and said  \n\nspeaker's-name, I never know it's so hard<,>\n That's what him said\n listen listen every year\n\nI run for position because I think it was easy and coming here I realise\n\nman he said  hats off to all the counsellors who pass<,> hats\n\noff you know\n It's a lot of work especially if you are dedicated to it\n You can come in there and slack off when you come back out and\n\nlose your job it was easy\n But any of the counsellors who come out and say it was an easy job\n\nthat means they didn't do anything\n anything\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nsee it as you know something to add to my resume   you know\n\nsomething\n\n<$A>  how a\n\nlot of persons see it\n But if they come in and behave that way\n For example or they're not coming out and learning anything\n You should go into the course bring something new and come back\n\nout and   be    a new person in terms of you\n\nlearn a lot from all of this experience because there is a lot to do and a\n\nlot of meetings\n future\n\nyou're looking at\n It's not just sitting down and meeting for meeting's sake or\n\nsitting down because you need to have a  union\n not it\n we don't present a voice at\n\nadministrative level they decide on what they want to do\n And a lot of times because they're sitting up there they not see\n\nwhat's happening on the ground in terms of the students\n Them make decisions not to spite the students but it's based on\n\nthe information they have and if there is no student rep there to tell them\n\nlisten this is what the students are saying there is no other way for them to\n\nknow\n union is necessary and it has been very\n\neffective in effecting a lot of changes or in pushing some of decisions that\n\nhave been made to the benefit of the students\n\n<$B>",

criteria best\n Uhm we have a lot of scholarships right now\n Started advertising in February closing in May so that by the time\n\nthe students come they'd know if they're getting the scholarship or not by\n\nthe time they come next September from early so that if they can't afford\n\nthey can get funding otherwise or they'll know what they need to do\n But yeah that is basically it\n\n<$B>  You find a lot of students applying for the scholarships\n\n<$A>  The funny thing is we don't have a lot of students applying\n\nnow and I don't know what the problem is\n Cos the scholarships are there\n There are quite a few that we don't have any applicants for\n There are some that we have as much as thirty bursaries and we\n\ndon't have ten applicants\n So I don't know if it is they're waiting until a little later on a\n\nlittle later when but this year no we're not having a lot of applicants\n\n\n<$B>  because students are always\n\ncomplaining that they can't fund  \n\n\n<$A>  Hmm\n find\n\nit real funny because    if at the end of the day we\n\nhave ten thousand students and we  can not even five hundreds applying\n\nfor scholarships the only thing we can conclude is that they don't need the\n\nfunds\n\n<$B> \n\nproblems\n\n<$A>  of it I think one of the things I\n\ndon't know how true it is but from my perspective I'm wondering if it is that\n\npride is one of the things that they don't apply\n Because they feel that if they apply it means that they're poor and\n\npeople going to know that they need money\n So I'm wondering if that is one of the reasons why they don't apply\n Another could be that they just can't be bothered\n The form is six pages long\n So they might look at it say listen if I want two scholarship I not\n\nwant to sit and fill out six or twelve pages\n But how I look at it if you are in need if it's twenty pages long\n\nyou're going to fill it out cos all you're losing is some pen ink    and some time\n\n\n<$B> \n\n the form is not like     \n\ndifficult\n\n<$A>  it's\n\nnot difficult\n It's asking questions that you know\n You would know it's ask your name it ask your address it ask you\n\nwhy you apply\n Those are simple questions\n It ask you about your co- curricular activity\n Very simple questions\n You don't even have to think to answer them\n So I\n Yes it's six pages but I can't see why it would deter you from\n\napplying\n Otherwise I can't think of anything else\n\n<$B>  uhm apart from the scholarships the\n\ndepartment offers anything else you know about\n\n<$A>  Well we have scholarships we have bursaries we have cash\n\ngrants we have book grants we have meal subsidies and we have loans\n Uhm the scholarships and bursaries we just started administering\n\nthe bulk of it because at first it was with the section outreach and awards\n\nbut the awards section was transferred to our office\n So that's the scholarships and bursaries\n We're having the book grants cash grants loans and meal subsidies\n\nthat we offer to students\n Those are primarily based on financial need but at the same time\n\nwe'd still want to see some level of<,> at least good academic performance\n We don't want to give it to somebody who is failing everything\n\nbecause it's money that was donated and you have to account for it in the end\n So we have those grants that are on a needs basis\n We don't focus too much on the academic but we still want to see\n\nyou doing some work<,>\n\n<$B> \n Well if you get a scholarship is it likely that you'll also get a\n\nbook grant or meal or   <unclear> word</unclear>\n\n<$A>  a policy\n\nper se that says if you have one award it can be of any value but you cannot\n\nhold more than two awards and if you do have two awards together the value\n\nmust not exceed seventy-two thousand\n So if you get one scholarship or bursary worth three hundred\n\nthousand that's fine but if you're gonna hold two scholarships or a\n\nscholarship and a bursary it can only be up to seventy-two thousand\n cash grants and meal\n\nsubsidies are outside of the scholarships and bursaries but as I said it's\n\nbased on need\n So let's say you'll get two scholarship for seventy-two thousand\n\nand we still see that you're in need then we might look at you and say\n\nalright let's give you a little cash grant to help out or a little meal\n\nsubsidy so you have meals every days\n But one of the things we also look at when we're looking at\n\nfinancial need is if the person applied to student loan\n you're going\n\nto    take every step to find all the funds you can\n\n\noppoopposed<,>\n The only hard part I might think of is probably getting guarantors\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n at this stage the only thing you\n\nshould be looking at is finishing your school<,>   finishing your\n\ndegree and then later you worry about paying back<,>\n time to pay back yes and it might not be easy\n\nwhen you start paying back but if you want the degree if you want the\n\neducation you're going to make the sacrifice\n So you're going to try and borrow some money\n Even if you don't want a student loan you go to the bank\n\nthen<,>\n But don't come second year or first year with zero dollars to pay\n\ntuition zero dollars to pay hall fees and expect to find scholarship and\n\nbursaries to fit it\n What if you don't get the scholarship and bursary\n\n Uhm as I told one student apply to the student loan and if you're\n\nthat good you'll get the scholarships and use the scholarship to pay back the\n\nstudent loan<,>\n But don't come and depend on the scholarship and if you don't get\n\nit you're going have to pack up and go back home\n You have to plan ahead\n Apply if you're expecting money from some relative overseas still\n\napply to the bureau\n When you get the money you just go back and pay the bureau\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

so\n\nmuch<,> time that he's  lying there so much Mayfairs all\n\nover who don't even know that is all  make colour \n\nmake  that he's only  those kind of things \n\n are  sleeping around because

simple\n Humans used to either beat them up or them turn them into gods\n\nwhichever one that wanted to do<,>\n And after a while the Dark Hunter died off\n Now Taltos was like one of the last ones\n\n\nrecording-continued\n Couldn't find his way back home and he found this nice village\n\nthat took him and everything\n\n\nthey always different because they were taller<,> cos it\n\nwas at the time when humans were more hunched back and you had short\n you had\n\ntall men\n\n\neverything\n were\n\nthere uh torturing and then he found out that humans used them for\n\nceremony<,> like    to \n\n<- > special persons found out later that  special persons\n\ncould  birth them even though they're not related\n and people who\n\nhad special sense or people which   uhm \n\ndied out cos they

\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  realise him he's and his family is so\n\naccommodated\n\n<$A>  because their family was strange too\n\n\nthat  why because of that little Mayfair man\n They believed all

had secrets    and they\n\njust kept to their cos from him grandfather who did not mess round\n\nwith the vampire and  buried graves and everybody just look  uh\n\nnot even look upon it<,> and\n\neverything\n other vampire books cos I also read\n\nthis  Christiane Heegan<,> she do vampire books too but\n\nshe  uhm her vampires are not vampires they're \n\nCarinthians/Corinthians\n\n and\n\nthe  Carinthians/Corinthians    are the\n\ngood ones\n race of\n\npeople they're a separate race of people   \n\nCarinthians/Corinthians and you have the male and the female but\n\nwhat has happened throughout the centuries is that the  \n\n male babies are surviving<,> and the female babies\n\nare always dying\n However but males need their females\n\n\nthey will start going to the darkness\n\n\ntotally  going to the darkness that is when they become vampires\n\nand they have to be destroyed and they start   uh \n\nfeeding on human kind and start killing any and anybody \n\nCarinthians/Corinthians and    human\n\nalike\n her books now she pick on the\n\n Carinthians/Corinthians who are like the saviours of their people\n So like they will come and cos they fear humans too because humans\n\nsometimes will come and kill them off because them believe all vampire all\n\nlots of  us are bad basically\n\n Right\n have them animal\n\nform a animal familiar<,> the animal familiar and  that\n\nshe used characters of the  Carinthians/Corinthians who like were \n\n uhm  uh  great soldiers so they to\n\nprotect their people they used to fight off the vampires and stuff like that\n\nand uhm protect the humans who allow them to live near there and stuff like\n\nthat<,> from the vampires or from wars and went into wars and\n\nhelp out but whoever are their allies and everything\n each\n\ntime these warriors fight  <,>  the more they're going to\n\ndarkness so although they're saviours of the people the people also\n\nare afraid of them because    if\n\nthey change they'll be very very powerful<,>\n\n\npowerful uhm  powerful now\n uhm the only person who\n\nreally could kill them  <-> is themself<,> is</- >  is\n\nthemself or somebody   uhm  as\n\npowerful\n\n\nrevere them\n So you have one about these twins who were uh fight together and\n\neverything with uhm and  correspond and stuff like that\n But one of them realised that his brother was changing cos they\n\npromise each other like any of them whose if them  seeing one going\n\nfrom the other they will kill each other before them turn into  \n\nthe vampire\n So one of them realised that his brother was changing was going\n\ndeeper and deeper in darkness\n So what he did now\n He acted like he was turned he changed into a vampire cos you know\n\nthat the one thing that will keep his brother from changing is keeping his\n\npromise<,>\n So what he did was pretend that he was a\n\nvampire<,> to uhm so him father will keep up will be chasing\n\nhim so will keep on take him uh  so him not busy dwelling on his\n\ndarkness<,>\n\n\npigeon and then a fly fly and everything\n they set\n\nup bait and stuff like that<,> and everything to make him\n\nbrother  think say him a bad him a killer of people and hope that\n\n<unclear> words</unclear> search for him\n And finally him brother met a life mate as a uh met a life mate\n\nand everything\n And the life mate realised what the other brother was doing\n to uh the\n\ndarkness and she was saying she came to him and say don't worry your brother\n\nis okay and everything\n him\n\nnot he's feeling like he was going close<,> and what him\n\nend up doing him fall in love   uhm   with  uh  this\n\nhuman  man because\n humans can\n\nchange into vampires\n\n\ngifts like you know maybe a witch maybe psychic   have a\n\nlittle psychic power and everything or a familiar  one of those those\n\npowers there\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Hm\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>

school in\n\nKingston<,>\n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Uhm I boarded at school\n\n<$A> \n Board\n\n So how you found that\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n\n<$B>  it was kind\n\nof challenging you know\n Uh basically you know at a young age having to live with so many\n\npeople getting along with people from different backgrounds and stuff\n It was kind of challenging but then it was fun in a way and had a\n\nlot of experiences of course<,>\n\n\n<$A>  Mhm\n\n I always hear that they have a whole lot of rules at boarding\n\nschools<,> so what was that like when you lived on\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Well I guess it took a lot of getting used to cos it's kind of\n\nlike    basically your whole day is scheduled in a\n\ncertain way\n You know you go to school come from school you change your clothes\n\n and be it\n Then you eat study study-break then study again then you go to your\n\nbed at probably nine o'clock  , and chapel every night\n\n<$A>  Mhm\n\n\n<$A> \n\n How you cope with that\n I don't think I could live through that at all\n\n<$B> \n Well as I said before it took a lot of getting used to\n You know once you get used to it you know it just coming like a\n\ndaily routine<,>\n much still\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nand all of that\n\n<$B> \n\n\n\nI miss home\n I'd go home like every weekend\n but probably down in\n\nthe semester you know  I don't think so bad\n in the semester when you just reach\n you're really like\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay so why you choose to go Holy Childhood\n\n<$B>  but I don't\n\nknow\n I figured Dad figured that you know because uh Kingston school you\n\nknow it's one of the prestigious schools instead of just Trelawney with\n\nWestwood and stuff\n\n\nprestigious school and stuff<,>\n Okay\n So yeah\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mhm\n But I hear Westwood is doing well now\n thought Westwood was one of the\n\nbetter school\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Well yeah\n It's doing well\n they didn't send me to Westwood\n\nbut<,>  yeah\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  What you do on campus now or well what year you're in\n\n<$B> \n I have summer school\n I have two courses left and then I'm finished\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  And what's your major\n\n<$B>  Accounting and I doing two minors in economics and statistics\n\n<$A>  Mhm\n you find that\n\n<$B>  Oh God\n you know but Econ and Stats's\n\nreally hard\n I don't know why I took that up but I'll soon finish so thank God\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n So what you're doing next\n\n<$B>  Well I want to work for probably two years probably in some\n\naccounting firm or something to get my experience and then probably do my\n\nmasters\n But I do not want to do any more accounts\n finance or something like\n\nthat\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n So what do you do on campus for fun and stuff like that\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  You go to a lot of parties\n\n<$B> \n I go a lot of parties\n do dance classes too sometimes\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  the other day\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  was that\n\n<$B>  and uhm it was good but you know\n\nit turned off early so you didn't get the full vibe<,> basically\n\nbut overall it was okay I guess\n Last year was better\n Yeah last year was much better\n Or it wasn't as packed\n people\n\ndidn't go  ,  but it still turned out really good\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mhm\n So you only go activities on campus or\n\n<$B>  Yeah well just recently or this semester I started going off\n\ncampus but    most times I go to the

general then you  need to\n\nhave a  proper reasoning ability and<,> uhm computers are based on\n\nlike logical<,> uhm<,> operations<,>\n you just need to think\n\nlogically and you can solve

Uhm okay fine\n\n is plugged into the wall\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> Yes why\n\nis the computer not on<,>\n the cable that is attached to the C P\n\nU is not properly plugged in<,> at the back\n has not been

need to have for sure\n you need to have a what's called a reference\n So you say okay\n It definitely isn't\n\n\n\n step\n\nand narrow<,> in<,> right<,>\n that's basically it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  without having uhm your level of\n\nknowledge about these things and people would be like trouble-shooting every\n\nday and don't even realizing

what's wrong\n\nwith it<,> or have a general idea   this<,,>\n\n<$B>  Hm\n With what\n\n<$A>  With your discipline\n\n<$B> \n uhm in the computer the uhm I T solution\n\nuhm field which I'm presently working in<,>\n like setting up\n\nuhm local area networks broad area networks uhm<,>\n\ninstalling uhm<,> or setting up<,> computer<,> networking or systems in<,> uh\n\ndifferent organizations and to meet specifications<,>\n uh\n\ncommunication such as uh for example you work with Digicell<,>\n\nuhm which<,> will have an I T<,> section<,>\n\nuhm\n\n\nreverse\n\n\ntotally uhm computer  reverse\n\n\nreception and uhm <,> just the analysis that uhm entails keeping\n\nthat transmission and reception going that's basically what Digicell\n\ndoes<,> which uhm<,> it can get very detailed when it come round\n\nto<,> different aspects of it\n and\n\nit want to ensure that the signal is<,> uhm what is transmitted is\n\nreceived<,> and basically that uhm   \n\nyour handsets or<,> mobile phones help keep ability to receive them\n\nand<,> uhm<,> the handsets themselves<,> uhm<,> have the<,> capacity to give\n\nperformance as prescribed or as needed\n\n media we can look at\n the instrumentation section of\n\nit<,> instrumentation<,> which is basically uhm the\n\nmeasuring of uhm quantity<,> uhm via uhm instruments\n So we can look at measuring temperature pressure and those stuff\n\noriginally like say for example<,> uhm    best\n\nexample is for example in a<,> processing such as\n\nuhm<,> bauxite uh chemicals which has bauxite any bauxite plants<,> as the\n\nmanufacturing industry on a whole<,> uhm you also have uhm machinery uhm<,,>\n\nmeasuring machinery and<,> for example like in air planes you have instrumentation there<,>\n Basically just instruments instruments that measure stuff whether\n\nelectrical<,> or  uhm<,> or<,> natural stuff<,> which has the wind\n\nthe temperature the atmospheric<,>\n You're just measuring stuff just

\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Uhm another thing\n you one of those\n\ntroublemakers\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B>  Or were you the quiet little girl who would normally sits in\n\nthe front of the class\n\n<$A>  in the\n\nmiddle\n I come from\n\na family of teachers so there're a number of things that I wouldn't even\n\nthink about doing<,> because I know that my  \n\nparents or my family uhm they would be very<,> you know\n\ndispleased and I would really get it at home because  <- > they \n\nthey'd not spare the belt\n And uhm now I can tell you that and until this day I am one who\n\nbelieves not because I got beatings but I believe that children should be\n\nwhipped  , sometimes you know if when it is necessary\n going\n\nback to    the school days I enjoyed school also\n Uhm I wasn't a disobedient child\n other sisters and cousins were not\n\nbecause as I told you we went to the same school some of us were in the same\n\nclasses and all of that\n But uhm the teachers or parents made it their duty to know all the\n\nteachers<,> the principals\n\n\n I mean they the teachers    knew\n\nus and they knew that our parents took for X so if we should deviate from any\n\nof those rules    or what we were    required to do the teachers themselves would beat\n\nus<,>\n So there were things that we would think twice about before\n\nactually doing it\n And I'm not saying that we were any perfect uhm you know children\n\nthere but our parents are strict so   you would really think\n\nabout doing something bad   you know twice \n\nbefore you really do it\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Okay\n if\n\nif uhm  if you should have children would you you know raise\n\nthem or grow them in the same fashion that    you\n\nwere brought up\n\n<$A>  Uhm I would say yes\n Some things I would change because in an extended family you would\n\nhave uh    it has its good it has its bad uhm\n\n   in terms of uhm scolding\n\n\nthere  there  there would be somebody who didn't\n\nthink that the child should have been scold like that or at all\n And then you know uhm there was a little quarrel there you\n\nshouldn't have done it that way or whatever<,>\n Sometimes that can be bad\n When I look back sometimes it can be bad because it really doesn't\n\nhelp the child because the child will look and say\n Okay uhm this person is in my corner that person isn't so you know\n\nwhat children are they would choose who they would like or you know\n\n\n if I should have a child I would change some things uhm in terms\n\nof    bringing up that child uh to get rid\n\nof this imbalance cos as I said before an extended family can create some\n\nimbalance<,> in it\n That is basically\n oh what I\n\nwould change too is probably not to live<,> in an extended family uhm  I sound like I'm contradicted myself but in a way    the percentage that I use why I wouldn't uhm grow my\n\nchild   uh  in the same fashion is that sometimes it\n\ndoesn't help you to be very responsible<,> cos there's somebody\n\nwho is always there<,> to pick up after you<,>\n So sometimes I think that I wouldn't stay in the same house because\n\nof that problem<,>\n If I should say so for myself I'm proud of myself that I am an\n\nindependent person\n Yes my mother brought me up that way uhm my other family members\n But sometimes there is this little flaw and it happens to me on a\n\nregular basis you know where you don't do this because you know that somebody\n\nelse is there<,>\n\n That's the only thing that I would rethink in terms of having uhm\n\nan extended family\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  probably\n\nrethink that uhm but everything else   in\n\nterms of  how I was brought up<,> it would remain the\n\nsame<,> because uhm when I look at my other sisters my other\n\ncousins myself we're not doing bad when we look at how our parents brought us\n\nup or other neighbours uhm who chipped in in terms of you know if we were on\n\nthe wrong track or the right track\n And not to boast but sometimes when I hear my neighbours talk they\n\nwhen they would say to us you know I'm really proud of you girls they would\n\nsay really girls cos it was   most of us were girls right\n Uhm I'm really proud of you girls because we have never really seen\n\nyou guys uhm doing anything\n you\n\nyou  you having uhm unwanted pregnancies or you're coming in\n\npregnant and you don't know who the father is and all of that\n be\n\nbe<->because it sounds a little bit strange or because    you don't even think that either<,> to\n\nhave uhm pregnancy   to be pregnant  as\n\nteenagers or even in our early twenties<,> cos that was\n\na no no\n have this thing at home you know\n\nthe rules so   uhm\n most of the things that\n\n I was taught and I'm still being taught  I would use\n\nto teach my uhm<,> child or children if I should have\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Okay\n Uhm so don't you think uhm persons in your community you know will\n\nlook at you girls and say you know stuff about you girls\n\n<$A>  I'm sure people have done it and people are still doing it but\n\nit has not affected us<,> in\n\n<$B>  you cope with it\n\n<$A>  To be honest with you hm\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nI'm thinking now I don't want even persons who are  here they/hear\n\nthis say that think that I'm lying but I've really never heard anything\n\ncome back to our family to say that we're this or we're that\n\n but so what\n\n\n   I keep saying I don't know\n really analyse\n\nor assess the whole thing I don't feel any way my cousins and my other\n\nsisters really don't feel any way   because it seem    it may sound selfish we're always together we are friends\n So I don't think we really ever considered too much what anybody\n\nelse wanted to say of us<,> because we know that we have each\n\nother\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Okay\n And that's power\n\n<$A>  And that is power you know\n So even if somebody should have said anything or is saying anything\n\n  right now\n It probably may matter a little but not too much where we're gonna\n\ngo cry and I say\n This person said what because we're always together\n And that is what really counts in our family\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n Well uhm I think I've learnt something about you Mrs Deans and I\n\ndo hope that you will continue to do what you're doing\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  No\n It wasn't\n It was kind of interesting because you know not every day you can\n\nask somebody about their   childhood\n Yes Yeah\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  hope I'll get the chance to ask you one\n\nday   about your childhood\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Anyways thanks again\n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n<$A>  I think you probably need to just stick to the movies\n\nthen<,>  to remember everything\n\n What you're doing for the rest of today\n\n<$B>

but it just\n\ndon't work out that's actually get together\n And you probably like them and they probably like you but\n I don't know\n\n<$A>  Hm\n you\n\nthink\n\n<$B>  Yes\n Yes I think so\n\n<$A>  like for some people like they\n\nreally let that bother them like I guess you see that their friends \n\nand/or boyfriends and all of that   ending\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  hard sometimes you\n\nknow but I don't\n I guess in time you know patience is a virtue\n yeah okay\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n\n I'm sure you'll find one soon like you know you're one just don't\n\ncome along and get\n Maybe\n\n<$B>  Maybe not\n Don't know\n Well\n\n<$A>  I mean there are some persons who uhm they will get into some\n\njust for get having one and it is really not worth more they speak with it\n\nanyway\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n But then some people find you know people say that uhm UWI is not\n\nthe place to actually find a boyfriend because at UWI guys don't want to\n\nsettle down and it's just go around and stuff\n But some people find some really nice boyfriend and some\n\nrelationships that actually do last you know I guess that's rare\n\n\nword</unclear> I just need to search\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  probably the good

Campion and\n\nImmaculate obviously because they have more resources   to work\n\nwith and everything and   you know they were usually in prep\n\nschool once<,> who society turned to be the brighter\n\nones<,> which is not really   true because<,>\n\nand but    it's really sad it's like that\n\nbut<,> there's always<,> that sort of<,> uhm<,>\n\nstratification in society<,><,>\n Uh, I mean my personal opinion regarding Campion and\n\nImmaculate<,>\n not really a fan of Campion\n\nbecause<,> and I hope this is not going to be\n\nused against me<,>\n of\n\nsomething I heard right<,> but I'm not  on again\n\nbecause of thing that I know as a fact  , right uhm<,,>\n In terms of being all rounded students I don't think that Campion\n\nproduces the all rounded<,> students that you know \n\n  the work <unclear> words</unclear><,> people who can\n\nperform well academically<,> and then go by curriculum \n\n and get As and whatever <unclear> words</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n\n<$A>  They went to prep school where they get\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Is not really true because\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mhm\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  high\n\nschool probably just deal with how well you're able to swot \n\n memorize<,> because you come to university and everybody perform\n\n   the same   way uh eventually\n\nanyway<,,>\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n\ns    a  situation and it is a fact\n\n  it's true of a student from Jonestown <unclear>\n\nwords</unclear>  I don't know<,,> inner city area is passing to go to\n\nCampion and<,> two students actually   on\n\nCampion<,> asked for special orientation for them<,,> because they\n\nwanted to teach them  to get along with students from other\n\nclasses<,,> right\n thought that was really extremely\n\nrude\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n That's actually true\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  guess they probably would\n\ntell them things like\n\n\n$A-sneezesDon't bring people from your area in\n I mean that's disrespect\n\n\n   you know  regardless of where\n\nI'm from I should get the same orientation and uhm what that's going to do\n\nnow    is alienate the students   and make\n\nthem feel<,> you know uhm out of place and eventually\n\nthey'll start dropping out   and everything\n\n Yeah\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n And also I think all of them have to go to extra class\n\n<$B>  And they do\n them go to extra classes\n\n looking at the fact that\n\nthey're from upper class<,> families so they

why people want to\n\nbe doctors lawyers nurses and all of that   crap\n I want to be a witch\n I want to do magic\n you know make people well again by just\n\nwaving a magic wand or something you know and I believed\n\nthat these things you know could happen<,> and   you\n\nknow  I held fast to them but\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  So have you done anything at all to help yourself to be a\n\nwitch<,> or     at that time  did\n\nyou  do\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nabout uhm sixteen I uhm started to read black books of magic uhm\n\n\nlived next door she is  <,>  a healer quote unquote\n\nand uhm I used to go over there without the knowledge of my parents of course\n\nand    she used to give me books and you know\n\nI normally read and stuff\n However once this man came to my house and he was talking about you\n\nknow evil and all of that and uhm he said it makes no sense for you to get\n\nyourself involved in something that you know nothing about\n\nbecause you know the repercussions can be serious<,> and that\n\nwas you know what<,,> exactly exactly\n That was what you know cut my speed\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Oh because I was about to ask if I should have any\n\nfears<,>   right now\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Uhm additionally uhm I went on to sixth form and up to that\n\npoint I really didn't know what I wanted to do\n\n Not\n It doesn't really matter where as long as I am the centre of all\n\nattention<,>\n just glow\n\nright uhm\n well aspired to leadership positions during my earlier\n\nyears and whatever I you know die for I normally acquire<,>\n However uhm upon reaching sixth form I kind of you know pulled out\n\nof some of the activities that I was involved in\n form\n\nI did not know what I wanted to do even\n But the thing is I had an inkling for doing the sciences but at the\n\nsame time chemistry was very difficult for me<,> and it doesn't\n\nreally make any sense for me to be doing the sciences and don't you know have\n\nchemistry in it\n\n\nI\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  did not play a part in terms of\n\ntrying to motivate   you\n\n<$B> \n\nthat  that happened when I was much younger because I had a\n\nterrible

wanted to attend the university\n tell\n\nyou\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Indies\n\n<$B> \n\nCave Hill<,>\n Cave Hill campus\n However I applied for Cave Hill campus and I got through and I was\n\npreparing myself to go there but    I uhm applied for\n\nbusiness administration and some other thing because  <- > it was on the\n\nhumanities  it was in the faculty   of humanities<,>\n I know but I mean it was in the faculty of humanities\n\nand what they uhm had   uhm  illustrated in\n\nthe handbook had nothing to do with accounting   and maths and\n\nall of that\n So I felt that okay that would be good\n However uh my father he said to me that that wouldn't be a good\n\nidea because you know   well  you\n\ndidn't really do much business subjects at the A-levels so you know I\n\nguess you would struggle\n So he helped me uhm choose linguistics and media and communication\n With media as my first choice I wanted to do P R O and public\n\nrelations that is and uhm<,,>\n I chose linguistics as my second choice\n regrets\n really like the discipline\n\n and the work in it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  But you said in high school that you never\n\nliked\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  chose linguistics\n\n

uhm and your grandmother\n\n\n<$B>  uhm she is uh very feeble very weak but you\n\nknow she look forward to seeing me every holidays\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n Well my grandmother doesn't know what

I'm sure\n\nshe's boasting\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Well yes she is\n\n<$A>  Okay uh what uhm\n your grandmother\n\nand your uhm father in particular happy was to excel\n\nacademically<,>\n\n\nthere anything

\n\n\n<$B>  I went to primary school in my community and I don't know if\n\nit was because I was a dumb student or it's just you know me being there that\n\nirritates my teachers\n\n\nclass and I was normally sitting you know at the front as usual staring up at\n\nthe teacher and that was just me\n I think I understand you know what is being transferred but\n\nobviously I didn't quote unquote\n I

wrong<,> and then the teachers\n\nweren't telling me that   you know  it is wrong in\n\na nice way and you know   uhm  tell me how\n\nto go about you know approaching whatever the problem was\n abusive in it right and that you\n\nknow I kind of recoil you know so\n was withdrawn\n I wasn't you know working as I ought to be working at years four\n\nfive six in primary school and it got worse because  \n\nuhm  upon reaching grade five and six I<,> uhm had this terrible\n\nexperience the most uhm terrible I can say that    experiences in my entire life and uhm\n\nright\n This teacher she normally tells me that I'm an idiot I don't know\n\nanything right and    I'm\n\njust wasting my  money and of course being a child\n\nyou are thinking that probably she's right   because she is\n\nolder and all of that\n So I never used to do any work\n However uhm one evening I remembered she you know gave us some work\n\nto do and I figured\n Alright I'm going to do it because I never used to take my book to\n\nher right\n I said to myself I'm going to do it\n So I did it and you know I formed a line I joined the line and uh\n\nwhen I went up to her she looked at me and then    I\n\ngenuinely don't know if she read what was on my uh page but she just took the\n\nbook and tossed it to the back of the class\n And I was like oh my god this is so embarrassing\n Anyways uhm she told me that I didn't have any sense and I must\n\nread the instructions and everything\n went to my seat\n Well I took up the book and I went to my seat and this girl she was\n\nsitting beside me and you know I asked her to assist me\n\n\nshowing  pointing it out to me it's the exact thing that I had\n\nin my book right the same wording<,>  \n\neverything was like the  same   so I<,>\n\n\nsaid to her\n Why if there is something wrong\n And then I tested uhm again some other persons in my class and they\n\nin turn said to her Miss but   you know  \n\nshe is   correct and she was saying oh and\n it's coming from her it can't be\n\nright\n I was like okay\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Got it\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  felt real bad right and that was in uhm grade\n\n

that\n\ntime<,>\n\n\nat you<,> asking you to do things that you don't want to do<,>\n it was a\n\ngood experience\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nready\n\n<$B> , I\n\nactually didn't rug anybody\n\n\nthe nerve to do that\n what you'd call a facilitator cos I had\n\npeople who I could rug<,> and I never bother with that<,> never\n\nbother with that\n\n\nto do that to people but    it did serve\n\nits purpose  though\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  mhm\n What was like some of the difficulties you faced at Shortwood\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n  or administration\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  difficulty difficulty difficulty\n in the sense that you had\n\nto abide to the same rules<,> like<,> uhm you had to go to classes you had\n\nto<,,> after class you can't go where you're going and come back after a\n\ncertain time you know and stuff like that<,>\n fee or else you\n\ncouldn't get to do exams or get results or stuff like that<,>\n Uhm the usual interpersonal problems where you live in a flat with\n\n     three people or two persons\n\nand you know you have conflicts with people coming from different background\n And this is one of the reason why I said that the ragging itself\n\nwas a good experience cos    it sort of<,> blend\n\neverybody in\n You know people with different people coming from upper middle\n\nlower   class and you don't know how to deal with each other\n to\n\n rub out some of  <- > the  the  chips<,>\n\nbasically not much<,> except that I always wanted to go home  ,\n\n   and college to me was boring  \n\n<,> in the sense of entertainment<,> cos  <- > you\n\n you would have a fete which would start at say eight nine o'clock\n\nand by twelve o'clock it finish<,> and for me feting begins at\n\ntwelve<,> you know so   graduation\n Right\n people were like okay graduation and they leave go\n\nManor Park eat ice cream and come backThat's not graduation for me\n Graduation for me is after you leave the ceremony you go\n\nsomewhere<,> party all night

\n Well I must confess I didn't\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n did you guys have to wear a uniform\n\n<$B>  time\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Any dress code\n\n<$B>  There was a dress code in that you had to dress\n\nprofessionally I would say  ,\n\n\nyou had to dress as if you're going to school as\n\n  sophisticated as you're actually going to work but your skirt\n\nhad to be a certain length    you wear a proper\n\nblouse proper skirt<,> no slippers or stuff like that\n You had to wear sensible shoes\n You know something that I mean the basic as you're going to the\n\nclassroom in say on a Friday<,> that was the basic dress code<,>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n<- > at<,>  at\n Yes\n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$B>  well first of all uhm I'm a off-campus\n\nstudent<,> uhm\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Full time\n\n<$B> \n\n\nthere's basically no rule<,> here<,,> there's basically\n\nno rule<,> on campus here now<,> whereas you had to<,> say dress a certain\n\nway there at Shortwood\n I\n\nunderstand so<,>\n\n\nand some aspects of it I can deal with some aspects I can't deal\n\nwith\n\n Some aspects I can deal with some aspects I can't deal with\n people dress on\n\ncampus well I shouldn't say people ladies   dress on campus<,>\n\npersonally    it bother me but then<,,> they don't\n\nget in my way so I don't bother trouble them<,>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  believe\n\nthat<,> maybe some of the rules that govern Shortwood should be implemented\n\n<$B>  maybe I'm not gonna\n\nsay yes because  when uh you are on a different level now<,> but I\n\nthink there should be some<,> amount of uhm\n\n\nworking<,>  or willing to<,> put something\n you can't allow people to do as\n\nthey like cos if you allow people to do as they like then you're going to\n\nhave hell<,> breaking loose<,>\n guideline\n\nsomewhere<,,>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nskimpy you know things you  do wear the brassieres and<,> some skirts\n\nyou   wouldn't even think of coming\n\nout of your <unclear> word</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Yes yeah yeah\n and I and I and I always\n\nsay  I always say to myself<,>when I see the guys dressing\n\nlike that then I will start dress like that\n\n<$A> Why\n\n<$B>  when we dress that way the guys have all the fun\n\n ,\n\n it's unfair\n dressing like\n\nthat now we get some of the fun too\n we do\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$A>  I don't know if you see\n\nanything wrong with it but<,,> you know they wear some<,>\n\n<$B>  be a bit\n\n  unkempt\n\n\nto me  there is more scope<,> in dealing with the raggedy than<,>\n\n  dealing with

coming here<,>   how did you feel about it<,>\n\n<$B>  after struggling with years\n\nof fear of coming here<,>\n really wanted to\n\ncome<,> in the sense that some people just wanna come a UWI you know \n\n wanna come to UWI<,>\n hear it's not a nice place it's a\n\nconfusing place you get no directions<,> you are just told\n\nwhat you need to know<,> uhm some time not even what you need   to\n\nknow  and uh among other  likl things like  <,>  I say I have a friend of mine who was taken out of\n\nan exam<,> just because<,> he owed some money\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n Cos he will be here\n\n\n at least  holding all the results<,> you know\n\n rather than taking and stuff like  those<,>\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nyou   you had right how do you find it now\n\n<$B> , it's proved\n\nsome of the fears\n As a matter of fact I don't think I wanna come back up here\n\n<unclear> words</unclear> living\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  True\n\n<$B>  I don't think so\n sense that I might not have\n\na choice<,,> but if I have a choice I'm not coming back<,,>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nconfusing<,> because it I remember what and they you know<,> good right\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nwhen  when they had orientation and they tell you go to the\n\nassembly hall well the people weren't yet  oriented and they didn't\n\neven know what<,> cos   what  I find it\n\nthat okay<,> there's somebody who<,,>  they've got maths\n\nscience<,>    or did maths education<,>\n that they have\n\ndone<,> not knowing where else to go  ,\n no knowledge of what is happening outside of that\n\n\n that they advise me to and if somebody ask me what to do I would\n\ntell them the   same thing so there's nobody going outside of\n\nthat<,>\n And that not really nice because sometime you don't want to do\n\nwhat you're given to do<,> right\n Sometime you want to do your own thing or something along the line\n\nthat you want but because of the advice that   you get<,> you\n\njust have

this university\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A>  How long have you been uhm attending school here\n\n<$B>  Well one year now\n\n<$A> \n\ncoming here\n you expecting something\n\ndifferent than you found when you got here\n Are you disappointed\n\n<$B>  No not disappointed\n\n\nreputation\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n And what is it\n What is your major\n\n<$B>  Uhm education history\n\n<$A>  So uh were you a teacher before you came here\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A>  to\n\ngo back to teaching\n\n<$B> \n\nthe options\n\n<$A>  is it that\n\ndrew you to teaching in the first place<,>\n\n<$B>  Well I love kids and I thought it was the best way for me to\n\nyou know give back to society so to speak   so that was the main\n\nreason\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  what age\n\ngroup  <- >  uhm    do you\n\nprefer to teach\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nMhm\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B> \n You know you have to have a lot of patience to deal with the\n\nyounger sets and that level    you can interact with\n\nthem easier so that's why I prefer that age group\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B>  Saint Catherine\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  the\n\nbest thing that Saint Catherine has to offer<,>\n\n<$B>  Heritage\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  What is it that is so significant about the heritage of Saint\n\nCatherine\n\n<$B>  Well it have a whole lot of history cos you know the whole\n\nthing with the Spanish the British coming straight down\n And you have a lot of remains of that history and it's\n\nwell-preserved and you know available for tourist and<,> for Jamaicans to go\n\nand view and learn about their history<,>\n to\n\nget to know  that\n\n<$A>  Okay\n Uhm I know that a issue that's uhm affecting students on campus is\n\nthis new uhm    liberalisation of\n\neducation<,>\n you know about where uhm school fees are\n\nbeing  <- >  uhm<,>  piped up   \n\nto meet with the international uhm standards and competition<,>\n Uhm that is affecting all of us\n What do you think about that\n\n\ncamp  campus can manage to uhm<,> or can afford right now\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Well I don't believe that we will all be able to afford a\n\nuniversity education but I mean facilities are provided for us to go and get\n\nloans and so on so<,> in the event that they do decide to raise the tuition\n\nfees<,> we have other options\n We can go and get a loan or can apply for a scholarship\n\n\n\nyour way out\n\n<$A>  uhm what about persons from\n\nuhm lower income backgrounds that will be coming into school\n Do you think that the school will go back to a level of kind of\n\nelitist thing where only uhm upper middle class persons can afford to come\n\nhere\n\n<$B> I don't believe that that will happen\n\nbecause<,> as I said scholarships are available and if these persons are\n\nof<,> university standard and academically  <,,>  they\n\nare performing at a level you know they'll be able to apply for these\n\nscholarships\n they\n\ndon't discriminate with your background so<,> I don't believe it will be\n\nchange back to a elitist<,> school\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n issue that is\n\naffecting the country now is uhm the economic uhm strains that persons \n\n  are under\n are you one of those persons that blame the government for\n\nwhat is happening    or do you think there are other\n\nexplanations\n\n<$B>  No I'm not one of those persons that blame the\n\ngovernment\n Okay I believe that people should work and contribute to the whole\n\ndevelopment of the society and if you are facing financial and economical\n\nconstraints you need to live within your means and find other option in order\n\nto  meet you\n I don't believe in going on and blaming the\n\ngovernment\n\n<$A>  how do you explain the\n\nfact that uhm<,> whatever you are earning now uhm is buying less and less\n\nlike    it's good to say live within your means but\n\nit's what can your means get you these days\n\n<$B>  I can't stop\n\ninflation\n what we were spending years aback is not as\n\nif it's not the same now\n different\n\nbut basically it work out to be the same amount of money\n\n\nand try and do as best as possible and some of those things that we\n\ndon't really need we just do without\n\n<$A>  Okay\n what do you think can cause more\n\ngrowth in the society\n Where do you think that the country needs to be going to ensure\n\nthat you know we're best positioned for twenty thirty years from now\n\n<$B>  Well I think we need to invest more in our young people where\n\neducation is concerned especially<,> primary education<,> and of course\n\nuniversity education and  <- > as  as long as we provide<,>\n\nthat for our young people I'm sure that they will come out successful and\n\ninvest in the country so<,,>\n Mhm invest in our young people that's the only thing we can do now\n\ncos<,> it's about  all our assets   so\n\n<$A> \n female as a woman in the\n\nsociety what do you think are the major uhm issues   \n\nthat women face    in Jamaica<,,>\n\n<$B>  I believe that women have\n\nthe opportunity to achieve anything they want to once they set their mind to\n\nit and obstacles will be there yes but<,> as long as you're determined to\n\nachieve something nothing will really stop you<,>  \n other than the fact that being a female is a problem\n\nwithin itself because I mean you fall prey  <,>  to\n\neverybody in the society cos they believe that we're the weaker sex<,> other\n\nthan that I believe that whatever a woman want she'll achieve<,>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  Despite the barriers\n\n<$A> \n that\n\nyou're married  that I'm assuming\n Do you have any children\n\n<$B>  No\n Not yet\n\n<$A>  You're planning to have children\n\n<$B>  When I can afford them\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n Uhm what is it that you want for yourself\n\n\nthat's    obviously   \n\na goal but what do you want    for yourself\n\nlike twenty years from now<,>\n\n<$B> \n Where do I see myself twenty years from now\n of\n\ncourse<,> having<,> my own home and a vehicle to get around<,,>\n\n\n\njust  just you know the everyday dream owning your own assets\n\nand living comfortably  \n that's it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n the\n\nmajor challenges of married life that you found<,>\n\n<$B>  Well I haven't found the challenges yet cos I've only been\n\nmarried for a year  , so basically I'm still on\n\nthe honeymoon phaseso<,> the challenges    I don't reach that section yet but<,,> from what I've\n\nheard<,,> communication is the key so we're working on that more than\n\nanything else now<,,>\n So when I reach the challenges I'll call you and let you\n\nknow\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> Right\n\nuhm<,> I know that on campus there are a lot of<,> issues affecting students\n\n <,>  or behavioural problems that uhm a lot\n\nof people uhm<,> are talking about or is constantly a problem and I know one\n\nof them has to do with females and how they dress to come to school the\n\nbehaviour on campus\n A lot of people think it's not uhm what you would expect from uhm\n\na tertiary level institution especially one like this one\n\n\n<$B>  Well we have to keep in mind that we're dealing with adults\n\nhere and you can't really put restrictions on adults where   their\n\ndress code uh you know <-> their</- > is concerned and<,,> in order for\n\nus to really live up to<,>    the fact that\n\nwe're a    quote unquote liberated university\n\nyou can't really put restrictions on people's dress and so on because it's a\n\npart of their culture and really and truly you'd be <unclear> word</unclear>\n\ntheir culture if you tell them that well certain things they can't wear<,>\n individuals on the\n\ncampus and<,,> affecting them in such a way that\n\nit will<,> impact upon their education well something must be done about it\n\ncos<,> we need to provide a comfortable<,> setting for everyone\n\n\n<$A> \n\nunclear-words-due-to-interruption-of-\n\nrecording\n Uhm another issue that affects the university is that a lot of\n\npeople seem to think that the university does not give back enough    to the society like uhm for an institution that    is supposed to turn out the best minds in the\n\nsociety there is not enough that is given back<,,>\n\n\n<$B>  back in terms of what\n\n<$A> \n Like bright ideas that are supposed to come out of the persons\n\nthat come from here like uhm to help to usher uh the society into a new era\n\nuhm<,>\n\n that kind of way\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n  these things cos I mean<,>   \n\nthe government funds a lot of projects over here and the university\n\nis involved in a number  <,>  of projects and most of\n\n <,,>  the issues\n\nthat we deal with in the society today I'm under the\n\nimpression that  in this university \n\n<- >   the intellectual potential of persons that come out of\n\nthis school is not really realized and    the\n\nuniversity functions    ,  as\n\n<$B> \n\n to really uhm exploit these<,,> potential\n\n\n<$A>  don't know\n because\n\n<$B> \n\n something in place where<,> they can capitalize  \n\n on the resources that are available here I don't think we'll\n\never<,,> really realize the true potential of university graduates<,>  \n\nand that's the reason why most of them leave the country cos there's\n\nreally nothing here for them to do<,>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nuniversity encourages independent thought<,>\n\n<$B>  Yes I think so\n\n<$A>  your experience in\n\nthe area that you are\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n\nuhm<,> individuals to explore various ideas<,> but you need to explore it \n\n  and ensure that you have<,> you know<,> sources to\n\nback it up\n\n\n   be writing down things just because you believe\n\nthat it's like that\n\n\n<$A> \n Cos I've known that a lot of people think that this uhm university\n\njust functions as a way of like maintaining the status quo and not muddying\n\nthe waters just keeping things as they are<,,>\n hasn't been much radical thinking that has\n\ncome out

\n\n<$B>  Uhm did you enjoy sporting activities sports day or something\n\nlike that\n\n<$A> \n I enjoyed it as a spectator yes uhm having the responsibility of a\n\nteacher to motivate students I had to<,> pretend that I was\n\nhighly motivated to participate in sports   you know\n some aspects of it were cos there are\n\ntimes  <- > when when  when you have your personal thing<,>\n there are times\n\nwhen you have your personal thing to deal with and this  house\n\ndevotion  morning so you had to find it within yourself to motivate\n\nthem\n always come last\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> So it wasn't original it wasn't uhm\n\ngenuine\n\n<$B> Which one was that\n\n<$A> \n\nword</unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  right\n So nobody wanted to participate nobody wanted to come to most\n\nmeeting so as the teachers you had to dig deep in yourself to get them\n\nout<,> and to get them moving\n achieve something at some point in time uhm whereby\n\n   the dance teacher contributed to us winning\n\ncheerleading   and that sort of motivated so we eventually move\n\nfrom last to about third or something like that\n I\n\ndon't know\n issue though was\n\nthat you know at times you had to pretend as if you know\n\n\nyou know sit down and educate anybody anymore like you\n\nknow what I mean<,>\n\n\nthat's  that's teaching   basically that's\n\nteaching basically\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  it the career you wanted\n\n<$A>  farthest from my\n\nmind farthest from my mind but I suppose<,> uhm you could say that I was put\n\nthere didn't choose to go there I was put there so<,>      I developed an appreciation for it\n still don't love\n\nit<,> but the appreciation that I have for it  \n\n and whatever you get paid for you must do it well\n\nthat I think\n that anyway you mustn't do\n\nit well<,> but I'm saying once the country's  \n\ngiving you something to do a job I think you should attempt to do it\n\nwell\n Based on that I'm still in it\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  to\n\nstick  to stick with it\n\n<$A>  I plan to not to stick with it\n I\n\nthink\n\n<$B>  see yourself\n\ndoing some private classes cos you love the maths so much\n\n<$A> \n I think that's good\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n I hope I did well\n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n<$A>  what\n\nwe classify as radical<,> cos I mean the fact that you have so many\n\ndifferent clubs and societies and they're involved in so many outreach\n\nprograms and they have been doing so much for the community and the wider\n\nsociety\n I think that's a radical move the fact that we're so involved in\n\ncommunity activity\n We don't have to be marching up and down on the street for them\n\n   to you know feel our presence  \n\n it's felt in other areas<,> and not because it doesn't\n\nmeet the news doesn't mean that it's not happening\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Okay\n\n Okay so I know that tourism and remittances are like the two major\n\nforeign exchange earners in the country right now but considering that our\n\ncrime rate seems to be rising all the time uhm I don't know how sustainable\n\ntourism is going to be over you know   \n\nanother few years\n Do you think that it is sustainable\n what are other areas that\n\ndo you think that the country could move in to ensure that we\n\ncontinue    to have a presence in the international\n\nsystem\n\n<$A>  Well I believe that tourism is sustainable cos we're not the\n\nonly country that is suffering from a high   \n\ncrime rate now and maybe it's because we're such a small country why\n\nit seems    so horrifying\n\n\nhigh crime rates and their tourism sector seems to be booming and doing well\n I think what we need to focus on is educating our people and\n\nmaintaining the high level    of hospitality that\n\nwe can in order to encourage people to return to our country as you know the\n\n  vacation destination<,> and also capitalize on our remittances\n\nencourage    our students and our graduates when\n\nthey leave that you now they need    to contribute\n\nback to the society whether they're going to go over there and work and then\n\ncome back out here    and open a business    or even sponsor students     \n\nto further their education\n\n\nto gain the most out of  <- > our  our graduates\n\nand our society\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Okay uhm and this is like the second or third time I've heard\n\nyou mention businesses and<,> you've said that that is something\n\nthat you want to do\n\n<$A>",

{'text': "<$A>  So Kedisha which high school did you go to\n\n<$B>  Well I attended Merl Grove High School uhm it's an high school\n\nsituated in the Corporate Area\n\n<$A>  Where\n\n<$B>  On Constant Spring Road\n\n<$A>  Okay\n What was Merl Grove like\n\n<$B>  What was Merl Grove like\n Uhm first off it was an all-girls school so I mean there was nothing\n\nspecial about it  \n\n\n<$A>  you say there wasn't anything special\n\nabout it\n\n was different\n What made it different from the other high schools\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  for me it\n\nwas just the relationships I formed with uhm my friends and   uhm with  my classmates in general\n that was the key for me uhm\n I never fancied my teachers much but I fancied my friends and the\n\nrelationships we had and just the fun times we had together uhm just getting\n\nprepared for exams uhm<,> hm just hanging out after school having fun coming\n\nto school early in the morning having fun talking about  <- >   stuff that seem irrelevant now like Backstreet\n\nBoys and N Sync I mean\n the stuff you\n\nremember\n You don't remember the exams you don't remember anything but you\n\nremember those stuff\n\n<$A>  Oh well that sound different than my high school days\n Okay so what was sixth form like\n Sixth form is totally different from high school from first or\n\nfifth form right<,>\n was that like cos that was especially important in my life\n\nsixth form\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\ntotally different in the sense that uhm it was a turning point cos uhm fourth\n\nor fifth form    we were kind of categorised\n You have different classes\n You have nine one and nine four and you know we had\n So you know that we were different people but in sixth form we were\n\nboth combined to   uhm  make up the sixth form\n\nbody with people different parts of the school uhm in lower form\n\n\nkind of I guess a big wall<,> between us uhm\n the real world in\n\na sense cos   here  we were a set of girls who\n\nwere totally different who were all throughout lower fifth form  <,>  were made to believe that we are totally different\n\nsome believing that they were better than some and we were thrown in sixth\n\nform and we had to get along we had to cope and we had to<,> deal and we\n\ndealt with it in some way it's kind of negatively we had to fight it out and\n\n cuss it out and\n You know all of them stuff there and uhm\n sense\n\nanimosity towards other girls who weren't like us<,> and uhm\n\nbuilding relationships with girls who were like us\n Like we had class parties with our friends and eliminated the other\n\nhalf of the class you know\n\n\nfriends you know the K girls and  \n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  doesn't\n\nsound much different from like third form\n\n\nform\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  I mean in that sense\n\nyes but uhm there was the responsibility we had as sixth formers\n We had to be the end of the school\n\n\ncounsels and stuff like that and therefore the responsibility of taking care\n\nof the lower form    was our\n\nresponsibility in a sense\n\n\nteachers and then you had the sixth formers and I think that uhm it\n\nhelped to develop potency in the way that we knew that if anything happened\n\nit was cos all of us had our little class\n\n\n we had that amount of responsibility uhm\n\n\nprincipal and the teachers as needing to do this and needing to do that\n And we had freedom I think that was so important about sixth form\n We never had classes all throughout the day kind of like university\n\n  kind of together\n So we never had classes from eight to three or two thirty\n We had one class in the morning one in the evening and we had the\n\nwhole day and we could hang out in the library all day and you  \n\nknow we had to be studying for A levels    go to\n\nuniversity and stuff like that\n I think that was very challenging I know for me studying for my A\n\nlevels and getting prepared and getting the right grade and you know cos\n\neverybody dream is to go to UWI or some university abroad so I mean getting\n\nprepared was a really difficult time a really challenging time\n I remember our principal had this motto challenging but not\n\nimpossible and I mean that motto brought me throughout sixth form in \n\n everything\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  alright with the animosity\n\nbetween your classmates and you being responsible right  how would\n\nyou think that would affect you being as leader of the lower class or the\n\nleader or with the lower classes looking up to you prefects in sixth form\n\nthat were supposedly behaving badly\n\n<$B>  Uhm I think it had a negative impact and I think and that's\n\nsomething that the principal and the other teachers  \n\n tried to point out to us later\n In a sense these children\n Cos we never had a classroom firstly and we met outside under the\n\ntree and that's where we hung out at lunch and if somebody do something every\n\nwar would take place underneath the tree and uhm\n What I realise was that I guess in a sense we weren't respected\n\nespecially the fact where we hung out was where first formers\n Somewhere near there the first formers had their classes\n So that was kind of difficult\n I guess it made it difficult for us to earn the respect of the\n\nfirst formers because they're like<,>  \n\n they could say you know\n behave\n\nbadly you know and stuff like that and I think for me it was  challenging for me I know uh\n I wasn't involved in the war\n so\n even\n\nif you weren't involved it reflected on you as a sixth\n\nformer<,> and uhm<,>\n I lived in Portmore and we had a bus that took us to school uhm and\n\nfrom school in Portmore we had a school bus and uhm being a sixth former you\n\nhad to be in charge of the bus and running the bus and\n and I\n\nthink in that sense we saw how little respect we got   from them\n\nin the sense they're like\n You sixth former you don't behave any better than us and stuff like\n\nthat and you know\n\n\nlikl\n look like them to them\n They're like\n You're a sixth former\n You're so little you know\n\n\nyoung the challenge of uhm   you know trying to uhm\n It wasn't easy for you I guess in a sense to gain their respect\n\nbecause we never did anything much as sixth formers to gain the respect \n\n of the lower form students and I think that's something  I know  we regretted in some way but\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n That's nice\n You people had a bus to carry you from Portmore\n From Spanish Town too\n Town\n\n\nbecause the population  <- > was<,> \n\nwas high\n in the\n\nUWI  into UWI and your first day and you know   \n\n  receiving your   \n\n  acceptance letter and all of that\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Uhm that was incredible\n That was a dream come true for me\n that was something I wanted since I was in\n\nthird form\n I just wanted to go to UWI and\n I mean getting my acceptance letter\n I mean I first I got a provisional entry thingy and I was like I\n\nneed to get three Bs and I was like three Bs for coming to UWI\n set I thought I was set\n I must come to UWI and after getting that final letter I knew I\n\nmade it I was so happy\n I remember when I came to collect the paper and they had uhm\n\nwhat's that thing they have at the beginning of the semester uhm  \n\n<,> orientation\n I remember coming into orientation\n They had two weeks of orientation and every day I was at\n\norientation because I was so excited to be at UWI\n uhm\n It was just incredible just walking on campus and knowing that\n\nthis is where I am this is you know the top this is the cream this off the\n\ncrop this is where it all happens this is where you know three percent of the\n\npopulation you know all of them stuff there\n\n You feel I don't know I felt I know I felt great I felt happy to\n\nbe at UWI uhm\n\n\nwhatever challenges were going to be thrown at me uhm\n I was ready for friends new friendships new situations everything\n\nuhm\n\n\nto be accepted into the University of the West Indies for me I mean<,>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay okay okay\n Uhm so what is your major\n\n<$B>  Linguistics\n\n<$A>  Okay why did you choose that major\n\n<$B>  choose\n\nlinguistics\n Linguistics chose me\n\n<$A>  Okay\n What was your first choice\n\n<$B>  uhm that was\n\nmy first choice you know uhm\n I never knew\n knew that I wanted to come to UWI\n I didn't know what I wanted to do\n Uhm I remember I had this guidance counselling in upper sixth form\n\nand    we had to make a profile of ourselves\n\nand you know what you wanted to do and\n I was writing all this stuff\n I made this incredible profile but she say it lacked a lot of\n\nstuff and    I had a talk with her\n I told her that I know I wanted to come to UWI I didn't know what\n\nI wanted to do\n And I described to her the fact that I might want to go to Mass\n\nComm but    I didn't\n\nexactly want to do the stuff that were offered at Mass Comm\n\n<$A>  So what do you like about linguistics\n\n<$B>  What do I like about linguistics\n Uhm it's interesting it's different it's uhm challenging and it\n\nallows you to think\n I like mainly the communication courses that we do you know\n\nlanguage of negotiation and stuff like that because I think those give you an\n\ninsight into stuff that you    tend to\n\noverlook\n\n\n  did negations how people conducted negotiations\n\nwhat are   some of  the tools that they use and\n I guess after doing linguistics you don't look at stuff the way\n\nyou used to look at it before\n You see stuff in a new light\n\n\nuhm things  become more<,,>   not\n\n\nre uh yes  unrelatable

{'text': "<$A>  I think linguistics I think it's different from any other major\n\nin the department in the sense that it just focuses on how people use\n\nlanguage to communicate in different ways\n Uh that's why I love the communication courses that's\n the\n\nother linguistics courses weren't bad but I just love the\n\ncommunication courses in the sense that\n The exposure that they often relate to language and why people use\n\nwhat they use and why they say what they say and how they say what they say\n I mean I enjoyed those\n never enjoyed the syntax and the\n\nphonology much and those were the most challenging areas for me but I mean\n\n  <unclear> word(s)</unclear>\n\n<$B>  why did you do straight linguistics\n Why didn't you do language and communication\n\n<$A>  special which\n\nincluded both linguistics and language and   communication\n\n<$B>  since you didn't enjoy the\n\nsyntax and phonology  why didn't you do language and communication\n\nplus a minor\n\n<$A>  Well I thought I was going to do my major in linguistics too\n We have to do\n I guess I was told that if you going to do a major in linguistics\n\nlanguage and communication  are both <unclear>

 Okay\n So where do you want to go to study speech therapy\n\n<$A>  I'm not sure yet you know uhm but uhm I looked at some\n\ncolleges\n There is this one that is very appealing to me\n\n<$B>  And that is\n\n<$A>  College\n It's in uhm Boston\n It's very appealing\n They have a very good programme\n deals with uhm just all the aspects that I'm interested\n\nin health uhm communication uhm teaching\n\n\nrounded programme and they have an   in-out clinic that I\n\nthink would   uh I guess \n\nhelp in my own development and my own personal development in    my whole career uhm\n intrigued with Emerson\n\nright now but uhm I'm looking at other option\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  So how do you plan to finance going to Emerson college\n\n<$A>  Uhm even though it's my goal uhm I want to go to Emerson uhm I\n\nrealise that the whole financial situation will be   a\n\nbit of  a challenge so therefore I'm thinking of spending the year\n\nworking<,> uhm to gain some money\n thinking of getting a\n\ndiploma in teaching so I will be teaching\n be a certified teacher\n\nat the end of I guess two thousand and five\n\n\n  can get uhm uhm I'm uh\n Actually even though I'm interested in Emerson I'm more interested\n\nin going to the U K and to do   uhm  my\n\nmasters in the U K because of the fact that I have family there and I\n\nknow I can get financial help there and uhm I know I can get a teaching job\n\nthere if I get a teaching diploma more than likely\n So I'm thinking of going to the U K and from there try to work some\n\nmoney and try to finance myself through school\n\n<$B>  Mhm\n\n<$B>  okay\n I see you have a model figure\n Why didn't you try modelling\n\n<$A>  Uhm I tried it uhm some years ago and uhm it was good for the\n\ntime I think it\n As a young girl coming up every little girl wants to be a model or\n\nan actress and everything and I think I was no different and I tried it but I\n\nrealised that I\n Even though you might have the figure and I think there's more to\n\nit\n I think it's something you have to love and I didn't love it so\n\ntherefore I gave up on it\n\n<$B>  So why didn't you like it or love it\n\n<$A>  Uhm why didn't I love it\n I think in a sense it was exploiting uhm\n It was not so much\n I mean yeah you made money and\n You made a little money uhm especially in Jamaica here but I\n\nthought the person who gained mainly was the agent\n Uhm I'm also uhm one of those people who don't like to be told what\n\nto do when to do it and how to do it and uhm there's some stuff I just never\n\nwanted to do for myself so therefore I decided\n Listen man this is not what I want to do\n This is how I want to do it\n And I think that can be a problem when you have a agent telling you\n\nthis is how you need to look and this is what you need to do to look the way\n\nyou need to look\n And I didn't want to do the stuff that he wanted or wanted me to do\n\nso I chose otherwise\n\n<$B>  your major in\n\nlinguistics you're not told\n You apply yourself or what is it\n you learn sometimes\n\npeople tell you what to do\n\n<$A>  Not necessarily\n Uhm I think it's kind of different with school\n\n I don't think you'd come to school unless you know this is what I\n\nwant to do and this is what I want to accomplish for myself\n know what is it that you\n\nwant to do\n\n\n  what is the stuff you need to do for a degree and\n\ntherefore it's about you applying yourself\n I think in a modelling career\n\n\nmore\n Alright for example you wanted me to wear an Afro cos you thought\n\nan Afro looked better\n I didn't want to wear an Afro because I thought at the end of the\n\nday if I wear an Afro I'll have to sit down and comb out\n I'm a Jamaican I'm an African woman I'm black and I have thick hair\n I mean at the end of the day I'd have to sit down and comb that out\n going to be there to\n\nhelp me as my agent\n So therefore I don't want to wear an Afro\n I don't care if that's the look now\n I don't want an Afro\n think I'm particularly\n\nattractive with an Afro and  particularly I don't think I can comb it out at the\n\nend of the day\n And I think that was one of the stuff I mean\n me\n I'm a skinny girl and to look at me and tell me that I need to get\n\nskinnier\n\n<$B>  You need to get skinnier\n\n<$A> Exactly\n\n I love to eat you know uhm\n\n\n<$B>  actually told you that\n\n<$A>  I was actually told that I was one of the bigger girls there\n\nso therefore I needed to lose weight and    I\n\ndidn't   think<,>\n Exactly so\n I mean just small stuff like that\n I knew that you know this is not the career for me cos I'm not\n\ngoing to  starve<,>\n you\n\nknow uhm I guess buy into your<,> conception of what is\n\nbeautiful<,> cos    I thought I\n\nwas confident with myself\n\n\nwas  beautiful\n myself and\n\n   I didn't need you to\n\ntell me to how I can look to be beautiful\n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  why didn't you choose a different agency\n\nbecause I think Saint International look for very skinny girls while Pulse\n\nprobably    you don't have to be that\n\nskinny\n\n<$A> \n\n  Saint International who look for the\n\nskinny uhm\n\n\nSouth Africa was heat   you know in terms of the whole\n\nfashion industry\n thing and\n\nyou know\n were tall and dark\n\nor\n I\n\nmean even uhm  I mean anywhere you went Milan Paris you were\n\nthe hit if that's what you wanted uhm\n And that's what Saint International went for but Pulse and other\n\nand   and that's key  I think\n\neverywhere you go there is some for Pulse\n really want the tall\n\nand skinny girls\n\n\nJamaican girl<,> and    I\n\nthink that was a challenge in itself\n I mean yes they took\n After a while they became more open to what was the potential of\n\nJamaica but at that time    the focus wasn't\n\nso much on the tall dark African  diva<,> I\n\nthink<,>\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Miss World beauty\n\n\n<$A> \n\nright I mean yes\n But uhm and by the time I focussed on Pulse I was really was uhm\n\nguess disenchanted with the whole modelling thing\n at that extremes I didn't want to do it\n\nanymore\n I just wanted to focus on school and forget about the whole thing\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n is very successful now<,> and   \n\nshe's about your size right\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Well\n\n<$B>  She's skinnier\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> Are you sure\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$B>  Are you sure\n\n<$A> \n\nslimmer uhm\n Yeah she is uhm\n She's very successful\n been doing well\n to New York uhm\n She has an agency in London one in France and she's very\n\nsuccessful and she's doing  alright\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Okay\n TV the other day\n\n\n talking right\n So what about your sister\n She is in the fashion industry too\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Yes she is uhm\n\n\n<unclear> name?</unclear> Models in London uhm\n I guess basically her career has just started\n get off people uh\n Uhm she started uhm\n January uhm\n I think for her it was a difficult process\n I mean she's only sixteen years old and she's away from home and\n\nuhm\n I\n\nthink  for her is to be so\n\n\n it's new\n It's just

dropped it totally even\n\nthough C X C started from fourth form and I just took up P O B and accounts\n\nand food and nutrition and did them in one year and just drop all the science\n\n subjects cos

it get it lock yeah uhm   and\n\n<$A>  do you choose not to comb it\n\n<$B>  it suit how I want\n\nto look<,> it suit the person I want to be you know uhm\n\n\nrecording-interrupted\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Yeah it's about spiritual significance and\n\n<$B>  Yes I was saying that my lock has uhm some level of uh\n\nspiritual significance in that<,>    the way    my hair grows    into a coil uhm\n draw on the energy within the\n\nenvironment\n magnet\n How the magnet can attract different elements is the same way my\n\nlock can attract different elements in the environment and then use this\n\nenergy to do spiritual   stuff\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nthe dead hair that is falling out and you making it into a lock\n is that energy\n\n<$B>  The energy\n\n<$A>  What is that thing in the

it\n\ninto a different kind of energy<,> uhm\n on the biological and those technical\n\nterms<,>\n However I know for a fact that there is energy that you can get\n\nfrom the sun<,> and your lock really facilitate you getting that\n\nmaking you get that easier than if you didn't have lock\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  uh yeah I understand the\n\nconnection with the sun and the vitamin D thing but   \n\nyeah it can be transmitted through the skin and all that\n I don't understand the hair\n\n<$B>  at some\n\nuhm what's that now\n\n\nuhm electrical device you see    how    the way that my hair grow that's the same way    the wire wrap around<,>   uhm \n\nsome of the device in those electrical devices those electrical\n\ninstruments\n is a\n\nsimilar principle just like how   uhm  you wrap a\n\nwire around    or better put it uhm the principle of\n\nthe Ark of the Covenant then\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mhm\n it's\n\nnot healthy you having your hair and not comb it it's not healthy\n What you think about that\n\n<$B>  Uhm well the fact that they think and uhm that's their opinion\n\nto me uh\n a female having long hair is not healthy\n\neither you know  , but basically the point   \n\nis    how clean you keep yourself and\n\nnot how much hair you have and how you keep your hair\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nunderstand that Jamaican society don't really accept uhm dreadlocks\n\nor Rastafarian in    their culture so much\n Even though we're seen as the Rastafarian supposedly culture we\n\ndon't really accept those persons in the environment that we    see them progressing and so on\n you think uhm you being a teacher\n\naffects that<,> and being a dreadlock I mean having dreadlock\n\n<$B>  me being\n\na teacher      will  \n\naffect\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  into a certain environment being a teacher\n\nand having locks so you think it affects probably the students or your other\n\nuhm colleagues or the persons looking upon you as a teacher parents per\n\nse<,,>\n\n<$B>  There is no one way how any one variable or many variable\n\nwill affect another variable\n any\n\nvariable  any given variable will have on a particular person\n\nor a phenomenon basically uhm\n\n\n those experiences\n\n\nthey  they usually encounter persons   \n\nwith lock acting    in a negative way\n\nthen their impression    of   uhm \n\na Rasta teacher will probably be a negative one\n However if they have positive encounter with Rastas then the\n\neffect will be a positive one<,> uhm but it also boils down \n\n  to who this Rasta person is   you know\n\nuhm how this Rasta person presents his or herself<,> you know\n\nuhm\n you're a professional\n\nif you keep yourself clean and tidy if you're  manageable uhm if you\n\nrespect people basically    I don't really foresee any\n\nreal negative effects   uhm<,>  from you having a\n\nlock or being a Rasta\n I don't foresee that giving off any negative effects\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mhm\n\n\n<$B> Yeah\n Yes yes\n\n<$A>  Yes you do\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n So how do you think that impact because they see it as a drug\n\n<$B>  Impact on what\n\n<$A> \n\nyou know because they associate Rasta with uhm weed and you do smoke\n\nso how you think that impact    on your\n\nrelationship with people you're around\n\n<$B>  who will\n\nnot affect any any  will not affect any individual directly<,>\n\nright uhm<,,>\n\n\nsmokes and uhm    it probably    causes some distortion in memory or reasoning then\n\nyou can see how    it may hinder communication\n\nyou know between<,> themselves and uhm the people   \n\nwho they're around\n Uh however if there's no difference in the person's attitude\n\nbefore and after smoking the herbs then uhm  <,>  there'll be no kind of

herb\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mhm okay\n\n\n  or smoking or whatever some people they say don't\n\nreally affect them but some people see a difference in the behaviour of that\n\nperson    after uhm using   \n\nthe weed\n What you think about that\n don't think it changes your\n\nbehaviour personally<,>\n\n<$B>  No\n\n<$A>  It doesn't\n Why you say that\n You're aware of yourself during or after smoking\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A>  Are you sure\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A>  Okay\n Right and it doesn't affect anything\n It doesn't affect communication\n It doesn't affect your behaviour in general\n\n<$B>  in a significant way so that\n\nyou can<,> uh really notice\n\n<$A>  Mhm\n since it\n\ndoesn't change anything  why is it that   \n\nyou smoke it then\n\n<$B>  my\n\nbehaviour isn't uhm\n\n\nthat is

kind of<,> effect on me just that it\n\ndoesn't affect my behaviour in a noticeable way\n\n<$A>  Oh okay\n not noticeable other people\n\nhave personalities that they don't think   \n\nthat they themselves don't see but other people see it<,>\n how you actually see\n\nyourself is    how people\n\nactually see is not the same way that you see yourself\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  I\n\nsmoke and someone

another rose\n\n<$B>  And\n\n<$A>  You may also see another rose which is a child\n\nalso<,>\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Ah aha\n If your relationship is like a rose aha\n\n<$B> \n\nit  it uhm the sky's the

yes uhm but    like uhm most\n\nthings in life<,> it has  <- > to  to go\n\nthrough<,> different stages before it reaches that full\n\npotential<,> uhm\n So basically the relationship has a lot of

do something to that rose to make   \n\nit work<,>\n\n<$B>  I don't know\n\n\n  has uhm its own time you know\n\n\nnew season\n So basically I saying this to say that when the right time comes\n\nto behave in a particular way then I'll just behave in that way\n\n<$A> \n Okay so do you have a child or do you have children\n\n<$B> \n Yeah he's three years old and uhm I think he's poised

child need to explore you know\n A child don't really know what they want you know\n\nso<,> sometimes you just have to allow them to get some burn to\n\nfall and get some bruise you know what I mean\n they want things that is not necessarily\n\ngood for them<,> you know\n You can explain to them and tell them it's not good for\n\nthem<,> but sometime you just give it to them and just put them\n\nhand in the fire make it burn   them so them tend\n\nto<,>   actually know<,> or by that\n\nthey learn through experience<,> instead of you just telling\n\nthem no<,> and then when you turn your back them may just \n\n  go and do it<,> and  \n\n that uhm the effect of that may be more<,>\n\ndetrimental   you know so uhm spoiling a child  \n\n is uhm certain way I don't really understand

other people doing that\n\n My bag is searched but my person there's uh uh\n Can't we get it clear in the Caribbean that there are people who\n\nare prepared    to encourage us to facilitate us\n\nuh who are bad minded enough to want to bring in weapons of death and\n\ndestruction into the country\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  But we have it right here\n I mean let's face it\n\n<$A>  The

\n\ndon't misunderstand me\n and\n\nall this sort of thing<,>\n\n\n<unclear> two-or-three-words</unclear> them in this country\n\nright<,>\n you know what do you do\n they didn't get\n\nenough

Oh really\n\n\n<$A>  this is the point\n Where did they come into Trinidad\n Trinidad's a small small place\n They didn't come across the Gulf of Paria in some boat at night\n\nI'll wager\n It came in probably through some very legitimate trailer or box or\n\nbarrel or something like this<,>\n And it's a pity that we really have to search each other\n It's a pity that we have to go in to this\n But if we face this kind of security threat we better check\n Don't get panicky about it don't get vex when it's our turn to be\n\nscrutinised but just deal with it you know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n what if

his life\n\n\nwell      it seems to me   uh  that the criticism should be fair and it should be\n\nbased upon some kind of evidence\n this is a smear\n This is an attempt to smear without any

\n\n<$A>  An enabler government\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A> \n does it occur\n\n<$B>  Well I'm sure that's what I heard Mr Patterson say the new\n\nrole of the  \n I may have gotten the word wrong\n\n<$A>  Oh\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n Okay\n government is not\n\ngoing to be active in the economy    in the sense\n\nof being a uh uh you know of owning enterprises and  \n\n in investing directly\n\n\nin  in smoothing the way in making it possible    for uh uh entrepreneurs and whoever else to\n\ninvest okay\n\n<$B>  Oh you mean kind of like a middle man\n\n<$A>  No no no that the government's

 as has been done with uhm  Petrojam \n\n  or whatever else right the government can have  \n\ncompanies\n\n<$B>  had an enabler government before\n\n\n<$A> \n What I'm saying that is not the what he means by an enabler\n\ngovernment<,>\n What he means is the government withdrawing from that kind of\n\nactivity that kind of direct involvement in economic activities and<,> seeing\n\nits role instead<,> as paving the way for others for private industry    to get into that kind of activity\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nbut don't tell me like Mr   deal was an enabler\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  suppose that Mr\n\nPatterson would say this\n\n\nthings wrong with that deal\n uhm\n\n as it was undertaken<,>    with a\n\nview to making it possible for Mr Rawlings    to uh\n\nmaking it feasible for Mr Rawlings to put in some kind of investment that\n\nwould be ultimately beneficial to the country well\n\n<$B>  For which we still wait\n\n<$A> \n course\n But in relation to that particular uhm investment\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nmost of the   other  strings that we still hold in the\n\nsocial services<,>\n\n\n<$A>  No it means it means no no no no no no no no\n no no\n among other things that government will create\n\n  \n\nthe kind of environment<,> that will become <unclear>\n\nword</unclear>\n\n<$B> \n The big guys are going to get happier\n\n\n<$A>  no not necessarily uhm\n small guys might get happier\n\ntoo if the government    does that job and does it\n\nwell<,>    then small investors will equally uhm<,>\n\nfind the environment friendly to their investment\n\n<$B>  we've been watching for that\n wondered where the social service is\n I mean I'm referring to say like down in Mandeville where I live\n\n And I just can't find anybody who wants to take the

Mr\n\nPerkins<,> I know other departments and government Ministry the\n\nemployees they're experiencing the same problem\n\n\ntosay to <unclear> one-or-two- words</unclear><,> yeah it uh the\n\nwhole

{'text': "<$A>  Nine nine one two oh eight oh\n Hello\n\n<$B>  Hello\n Good morning Miss Gloudon\n\n<$A>  How do you do Sir\n\n<$B>  you know in recent times we have heard of a number of\n\ndemonstrations been taken place at our schools<,> disrupting uhm\n\n   the operation of schools and the performance\n\nof children<,>\n\n\n and I have been giving serious thought to it\n there is a particular school in St. Catherine where an\n\nincident took place recently and I am now wondering if there isn't a real\n\nplace for demonstrations\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n Excuse me\n Is there a parent teachers association\n\n<$B>  Yes there is\n\n<$A>  why isn't it operating\n is the power of the parents\n\n<$B>  I think that maybe that would be worked out in due time\n\n<$A>  But Sir that has got to be the court of first resort or we are\n\ngoing to end up with a society where children see violence on the part of\n\nteachers and violence on the part of parents and they believe that that is a\n\nway just to go\n Where does power lie\n We have something called a parent teachers association\n are supposed to\n\ngo into school meeting called to order order of business suspend the agenda\n\nand let us deal with what is going on in the school\n J B\n\nC we get to on the news flash and the thing\n Everybody go home and the situation remain the same\n\n<$B>  No I'm not suggesting that we should begin with\n\ndemonstration<,>\n suggesting that\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B>  begin with dialogue discussion\n That's what I believe\n\n<$A>  So why it not happening at that school\n\n<$B>  is in the embryo\n\nstage\n The problem is really in the embryo stage and that is why I see\n\nthat it will reach that end perhaps\n\n<$A> \n\nyou sound like an intelligent young man\n If it is in the embryonic stage then somebody need to get the\n\ncrocodile before it become one big crocodile\n If one is identifying a problem then parents have to turn up\n\ntogether and say look and teacher we have a problem here\n How we going to do it\n\n\nand feed it until we can get a demonstration\n\n<$B>  uh\n\nbureaucracy there    as the uhm obstacle in the\n\nway Miss Gloudon\n It's not very\n\n<$A>  management is\n\nthe bureaucracy\n\n<$B>  The Ministry of Education\n\n<$A>  What is the position of the Ministry of Education\n\n<$B>  Because that is what I want to point out to you that in this\n\nparticular school uhm the principal retired and uhm    they advertised the post for principal and uhm a\n\nnumber of persons made application\n And uhm the board recommended one person and the Ministry of\n\nEducation selected another person over the person that the board\n\nrecommended<,>\n Now\n\n<$A> \n\nthe word that you used recommended and very often the   Ministry\n\nof\n But wait a minute\n very often in\n\nterms of my experience with a couple of principal stories which made the news\n\nover the past year the Ministry of Education has additional information which\n\nbecause of propriety and good convention it cannot make public\n Now it is either going to be that we are going to develop a thing\n\nwhere the parents the school board everybody working with the Ministry of\n\nEducation can come to a point of trust in order    to\n\nunderstand that the Ministry of Education very often has information which\n\nproperly used sensitively used can lead to a good solution to the problem\n What has happened is that people say I say so and so and I want\n\nthat person to be the principal\n The Ministry for various reasons cannot come out in a public\n\nmeeting and tell you why the person is not so and so\n\n\nand  and mechanism where we can trust each other\n A small delegation says look uh we had recommended so and so\n Ministry said after consideration we have looked at so and so\n\nbecause they have the last word\n\n\n  not the mob for crucifixion\n Then go and sit down and say perhaps we could talk about this\n But you know what happen\n If we tell sometime what we know it go out and become public and\n\nlast and them cuss-cuss\n tell you off the air if I\n\nwere a different kind of person two highly publicised incidents with\n\nprincipals where if you were to know the details of it   \n\nthe story would end a different way but is not everything    good for talk and very often people at \n\n  the mechanisms that the Ministry has had to\n\nsit down and be quiet because good order say you can't go out there and tell\n\nwhat you know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Mhm\n In this case Miss Gloudon I can safely speak because I know the\n\nfacts<,,>\n go\n\nalong with what you're saying hadn't it been for the kind of uhm\n\npolitical uh approaches   that we have taken    in terms of uh uhm\n\n<$A>  Yes but alright so so\n You know what\n\n\n<$A>  you have\n\nevidence\n Well why not appeal to the Ministry of Education that in fact uh\n\nfrom the parents that the parent teachers association representing the school\n\nboard ask for a small delegation to go    to the\n\nMinistry to sit with  <- > the  the permanent secretary and\n\nwhoever else is appointed to put the matter before them to see if some of \n\n  the fears which you have and some of    the understanding which you have are the same\n\nunderstandings as they\n\n\n Ministry is put in the position where it cannot back down because it\n\nwill seem to be pandering to mob rule\n\n<$B> \n Mhm sure enough that's a good point and I see that point\n\n<$A>  So why doesn't a small delegation a small group of people you\n\ncan't negotiate with a crowd<,>\n Two or one persons representing parents one representing board\n\nmaybe one representing the teacher\n contact the permanent secretary and say this matter\n\nis one which has caused us some disquiet\n Would you receive a small delegation for us to sit down with you\n\nand to share our things that we may come to an understanding<,>\n do\n\nthat\n Dr Davis\n\nat the Ministry somebody who is willing to talk to people<,> and\n\n in at least two of the highly publicised uhm\n\nprincipal issues that I have come across I know that they have attempted to\n\ntalk to people<,> and that they were willing for people to come\n\nand talk to them\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yes,\n Thanks very much for that\n and\n\nI am sure that\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n Yes\n will definitely take that route but\n\nyou know is as uh\n\n<$A> \n And the other thing you know our teachers don't swear for nobody\n Don't swear for anybody\n You understand and that we have to keep an open mind in the terms\n\nof what is going to happen\n are the directions in which\n\nwe have to go\n What is it that we as the parents and the teachers want in our goal\n\nfor our children because it cannot be good for our children that they see\n\nparents strucking badness\n\n<$B>  Certainly Miss Gloudon\n We want the best for our school\n\n<$A>  And teachers strucking badness\n\n\nit's just a message to you say boy Miss demonstrate me can demonstrate too\n\n<$B>  Mhm\n and\n\nwe're prepared to have    the person who is\n\nboth qualified and able with the kind of experience<,> that would\n\ncontribute to the development of the school<,,>\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n You're right you're you're all\n Yes\n\n\n  it's not non-negotiable because    you will have one part of the story somebody else will\n\nhave another part but to sit down and sensitively with the Ministry say look\n\n   we have seen how in other instances    the road to appointing a principal  \n\n has ended up with potholes and everybody has  <- > been been\n\nbeen  been dishonoured in the process\n you perhaps help us maybe with the\n\nintervention of persons like yourself\n The JATA should have the kind of unit that people could go to to\n\nbe saying to the Ministry\n This thing is occurring with too much frequency because if it's\n\ntwo of them it's too frequent<,> too too frequent\n\n\n this selection is done\n How can we all comment on it\n I happen to be as part of a voluntary thing be involved with a\n\nparticular school\n A principal has to be appointed\n a sort of select\n\ncommittee of a small select committee of people with different knowledge and\n\ninformation to come together   for the interview of that person\n So when you finish you can say we found the person strong in one\n\nsection\n A person might be very good in terms of paper qualifications but\n\nin terms of communication    they\n\ncan't do it\n One person might be very set in their ways\n And you're dealing with a young generation which has all kinds of\n\nvisions and scope\n come out of the U W I\n\n   with a P h D<,>\n have passed every exam\n\nbut you cannot communicate with a fifteen-year old of today\n Well it's not one work you cannot communicate with some of the\n\nyoung teachers who see a vision for themselves\n You can't communicate with a system which is trying to change and\n\n   to fashion and to get people to go\n Then clearly your P h D makes you not suitable for that job\n\nbecause you cannot relate to the circumstances in which you have to do\n All of these I think are the criteria which have to go into the\n\nselecting of people who lead education institution\n How open are you to the mind of the young people\n\n Only as authoritarian or are you able to share authority\n How do you delegate authority\n Do you understand that your teachers can be empowered to become\n\npart of the management of the school\n do you regard the\n\nancillary staff\n\n\nthe  the principal doesn't control\n The principal is like a good facilitator who set up the thing and\n\nsay we are all going to work together\n And I think I hear the ministry say that this is what it is asking\n\nfor principal<,>\n Talk to them\n They will listen to you\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n Right\n The criteria that you've outlined are definitely the criteria that\n\nI have<,> and you're justifying    my\n\nposition<,>\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n When you're going into the discussion non-negotiable manner wish\n\nyou luck then\n\n<$B> \n\n,\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Alright\n\n that is not helping the\n\nissue\n\n<$B>  No Mam\n in that you know\n\n\n<$A> \n Not helping the children\n\n<$B>  And that's why I started the way I did\n\n<$A>  Yeah man\n Thanks for calling\n\n<$B>

this time of morning and people\n\nout here have to go to Bull Bay  and you have on the Bull Bay route\n\n and it\n I said I'm gonna report it to Transport Authority because you are\n\nnot going to

listening out for what you know we're going to take\n\nthis from there\n\n<$A>  Alright\n\n<$B>  But we're having serious problems because people have to go to\n\nwork six o'clock in the morning and you're out by the bus stop from five\n\nthirty and you can't get no bus and<,> many times I walk to Harbour View\n\n<$A>  Alright\n to say to you ma'am that I would like to speak to\n\nMr  Lucius White Managing Director of the Transport Authority\n\n\nbe  Bull Bay which fundamentally is a problem of people\n\nnot completing the routes\n\n<$B>  they talking\n\nabout this ticket system\n It's not working\n Because I notice so many times I sit in the bus I travel to\n\nBarbican and I have to take the S R Six and so many times I sit in the bus\n\nand I hear that the inspector  has done the route\n And they just go around the bus and issue the tickets without\n\ncollecting any fare\n And they give you all six seven sometime you get a whole bundle of\n\ntickets\n So I wonder how that go if they are not responsible for the ticket\n without collecting\n\nany fare and just issue tickets like that\n the system all about\n\n<$A>  Ma'am it is not a system\n People seem to be just doing exactly what they want\n\n<$B>  Exactly\n\n<$A>  And I'm going to promise you ma'am that I'll get in touch with\n\nthe Transport Authority Mr  Lucius White the Managing Director is\n\nthere\n I have a number for him\n And I'm going to try to call him about this\n And I'll raise the question of Bull Bay\n People not completing their routes is really the fundamental\n\nproblem\n\n<$B>  And there's another problem\n man had three busses\n he had busses on the road\n Now you can almost depend on those busses\n had to go out\n\non excursion and he took all three bus off the road<,>\n And I don't believe you have a responsibility to people and you go\n\nand take all three bus off the road at the same time to send out on  a\n\ntrip\n\n<$A>  Alright\n\n<$B>  And leave the people stranded\n\n<$A>  Alright\n\n<$B>  And Sundays you can't get any bus Saturdays you barely can get\n\nany bus and if you ever go out and stay certain times in the evening you have\n\nto either take taxi or sleep in

school and\n\na lot of people will be on the road and we are asking please instead of\n\nthinking about fare increase and they don't deserve it because they come on\n\nthe bus when <unclear>

think\n That's a road you can't use because of the same drainage\n\nthing<,>\n So it's a serious thing about them trying to sort out this drainage\n And we're really gonna have to deal with the

afternoon ma'am\n Negril\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  that we're\n\nhaving in the Red Grown area\n\n I'm\n\nnot saying that we have been getting water but through a different\n\nchannel\n We have been having water coming in trucking like every two or\n\nthree weeks when we don't have any water after two weeks or three weeks\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Can I ask you something\n\n<$C>  Yes Miss\n\n<$A>  Have you found out the reason why the proper source of water\n\nis not working\n\n<$C>  Miss Haughton this has been from day one\n\n\n<$A>  is day one\n\n<$C>  Day one from ever since I've known nothing has been going on\n\nfor us in   this\n\n<$A>  have pipes there\n\n<$C>  We have pipes in this area\n\n<$A> \n\npipes\n\n<$C> \n\nwhat's it it's the Hanover uhm<,> the   it's from the\n\nHanover area<,> that's   where it's\n\n<$A>  concerned about Westmoreland and\n\nthose areas you know becau' they seem to have epidemics\n And when you don't have any water it really tends to open people\n\nto possibilities of illness when people don't have an access to water\n Now you don't know why this water system has never worked\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  you asked the Water Commission\n\n<$C> \n\none-or-two- words</unclear>\n\n<$A>  listen to what I'm asking you\n what I'm asking\n\nyou<,>\n Has anybody been to the Water Commission and say why is it that\n\nRed Grown has no water\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  We have ma'am\n\n\n<$A>  you got an answer\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  they tell you\n\n<$C> \n\n like is on a hill\n by the time all these\n\nhotels and whatever   are fulling up their tanks and all of that\n\nthere's not enough pressure to come up the hill to uhm\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  And of course the Jamaican citizen suffers while the tourist\n\ncontinues to live in   salubrious comfort\n\n<$C> \n blaming things\n\non draught\n Miss Haughton we have rain every single day\n\n\n<$A>  you the hotels don't feel the draught\n\nthough only just the people of Jamaica who pay taxes\n\n<$C>  Don't\n I mean and if it's any other thing I mean everybody has great\n\nconcern but I mean us the residents have uh   we have not rights\n And it's like you cannot live in this situation any longer\n\n<$A>  Who's your M P\n\n<$A>  have a\n\ntyphoid epidemic in Westmoreland\n And one of the most fundamental things is to wash your hands flush\n\nyour toilets   have water<,,> and have water accessible so that the\n\ntyphoid germ does not spread\n This is my understanding\n And I'm saying if they don't give you the capacity to wash your\n\nhands you put pipes in that are useless cos no water comes through them\n So you wonder why they waste your money to put in pipes if no\n\nwater is going to come through it\n And how long has this been\n\n<$C> \n\ntwo-or-three-words</unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A> \n I don't know what day one is ma'am\n\n<$C>  I\n\ncannot  I cannot remember one morning waking up to find water\n\n  in the pipes\n two occasions

school\n\n<$A>  What basic school ma'am\n\n<$B>  basic school\n\n<$A>  Oh you mean the basic school that we got a call on the last\n\noccasion I did this programme indicating that you had put some three-year-old\n\nto stand up in the sun because they didn't pay his school fees\n\n<$B>  Yes ma'am\n\n<$A> \n and give your side of this\n\n<$B>  Yes Miss\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Do you know anything of this issue\n\n<$B>  I am the principal\n\n<$A>  Do you know of this child\n\n<$B>  April\n\nterm  the Easter term uhm I ask   \n\nabout twenty children did not pay school fee\n ask the parents to bring in the vouchers\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$B> \n\nthey they  they were sorry\n Some said the paper they did not remember to bring the voucher\n Some apologised for not paying it and asked me for by the weekend\n\nto do so\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$B>  are coming and\n\nhearing that she ought to pay her school fee began to abuse\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$B> \n\n she told me a lot of dirty words\n\n<$A>  Yes ma'am\n\n<$B>  in front of\n\nthe children she lift up her clothes tell me where on her to suck \n\nand where not to suck and uhm<,> there and then she threatened    to let her gunman boyfriend shoot me\n when I ask her to\n\nleave the school premises with her child because this type of attitude will\n\nnot be accommodated inside here\n I went to the police station the vice principal and myself we went\n\nto the police station laid a complaint\n\n\nto uhm arrest her or prosecute\n And I said no just to warn her\n\n\nthathat I accommodate such a parent    in that school\n So there was no way I don't go around putting our children on the\n\nstreet in the sun\n as a matter of fact where I am\n\nliving it's the same place the school is and we don't have anywhere there for\n\nsun\n the the\n\nthe  the house the school begins\n So I have nowhere there\n Haughton\n\nI have to be turning back children because of   \n\naccommodation\n school with three\n\nchildren\n\n\nand until the Lord started blessing me\n Now I have over two hundred children right\n And I could not I am also a mother I could not in no way turn put\n\nout a child in the sun\n Right now over five thousand dollars school fee is outstanding\n\npresently\n And no child has ever been put out on the street because of that\n Parents are advised that if they cannot afford come in meet the\n\nprincipal\n I also have children there who parents cannot afford it I am\n\ninvestigated\n And I realise that they cannot paid\n the time\n\nthey have to spend there they get free tuition\n\n\n<$A> \n Alright ma'am\n So what you're saying in fact is that when she says that her child\n\nwas put out   when she went for the voucher and came back and saw\n\nthe child in the yard that is not true\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  I did not put her child out\n\n\nschool did not  we did not have devotion as that it was in the\n\nmorning<,>\n line in the morning\n\nto pay the lunch money<,>\n So she was standing there with the child\n So when she was carrying on and behaving\n I said your child will not be accepted in school\n Take the child and go\n said uhm uhm\n\nI'm not taking the child to work <unclear> word</unclear> him have to stay\n\nhere you have to stay in here\n I said take the child and go\n Because if this is your attitude other parents there's about twenty\n\nparents and the others apologise because they realise it was wrong\n\n\nreali  realise that they were wrong\n And nobody heard any argument\n They came in in a decent manner and apologised\n\n And she lift up her clothes coming up in my face\n She went to the Ministry of Education laid a complaint\n She told them there that I put the child out on the street locked\n\nthe gate the six teachers came down on her to beat her and a passer-by went\n\nand called the police\n from the Minister of Education came\n\ninvestigated and found out that she was lying<,,> right\n I could not no way I'm there now Miss for fourteen years one of the\n\nbest school in that community\n And I would not be getting such a support from the people in the\n\ncommunity\n I have children coming from Yallah St Thomas\n I have children coming from Portmore all those places\n How could I\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Alright ma'am\n the public hear both sides of\n\nthis issue<,>\n And you have indicated that certainly you asked her to take that\n\nchild and to remove herself because of her behaviour which was unbecoming\n\nbefore students<,>\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  this thing happened six\n\nmonths ago\n\n<$A>  Oh I didn't you know I had the impression it happened\n\nrecently<,> quite frankly\n\n<$B> \n said she's not gonna stop until\n\ngovernment find a way to shut down the school\n talking\n\nto you this morning I understand because I did not hear it for myself I\n\nunderstand that you told her that she's to put a lawyer on it and parents\n\nshould not be sending their children to that school<,> no\n\nno way   <unclear> several-words<unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n Hold on ma'am\n Be very careful\n is\n\nas you allege<,>\n\n then that person\n\nshould not be responsible for

highly commended by the Ministry of Education\n\n<$A>  Yes ma'am\n This is why this programme is a sort of programme that allows you\n\nto come on without interruption   to put your side of the story\n\nbecause all we can do when we get calls is to comment on the basis of the\n\ntruth\n In other words if it is true what you are saying then I\n\nthink<,,>\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Haughton\n What I was expecting believe me it was for you as a moderator to\n\ncall the Ministry of Education<,> find out that there's \n\n uh what has   happened\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n Ma'am ma'am hold on\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A>  I have no idea about the Ministry of Education in this\n I got a report which appeared as if something that happened\n\nrecently\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n And I am saying to you ma'am that I'd was not even aware the\n\nMinistry of Education investigated anything<,>\n I got a report I commented on the report as I got\n\nit<,>\n And that is and I looked in the directory for a number for your\n\nschool<,>\n and as such I could not have\n\ncalled you<,>\n Right you are not listed are you ma'am in the nineteen ninety-two\n\n  directory\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nmy personal   name not\n\n<$A>  the point ma'am\n Now what we wanted to do and what we usually do is to call you to\n\ncomment but we were not given that opportunity<,>\n And in fact we said on the air that if anybody wishes to comment\n\nthey can call<,>\n And when you call we give you full air time to say your piece\n\nbecause we do not want to denigrate your school if it's a good school\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n I I\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$A> of the year\n have travelled all\n\nthe way to Hanover to share what I have\n took three thousand dollars out of my\n\nlittle saving took it down to Hanover to a little basic school  where\n\nwho I understand that parents cannot afford lunch money to buy rice flour\n\nand all those things and hand

you're\n\nobviously doing a good job<,>\n service and you're\n\nhelping a lot of people    who are not\n\nas well off to make sure their children get good  \n\neducation\n And I will comment on it on the basis of what you told\n\nme<,>\n And I will give you full air time so that you can state your\n\nposition\n need to understand that all we can do on this\n\nprogramme is to comment on issues as they're raised to us<,> you\n\nknow with the rider<,> that if it is true<,>\n Because we can't pass a judgement if it is true because we were\n\nnot there<,>\n It is very interesting to note that you said you went to the\n\nMinistry of Education and that you gave a name of a person who investigated\n\nit which indicates that obviously   you are open to being\n\ndouble-checked on the issue<,> which indicates that there is\n\nsome basic veracity in what you are saying as you would not have called the\n\nname of somebody in   the Ministry\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>

{'text': "<$A>  Hello\n Hotline\n\n<$B>  Hello Mrs Haughton\n\n<$A>  Yes good morning\n\n\n<$B> \n I have a problem\n,\n with this man for thirteen years\n\nright<,,> and<,> all my earning is in the house right\n Is his house but you know I helped him to pay the mortgage on so\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  So it's not his house alone\n That's the first thing you need to understand\n\n<$B>  my name is not on the\n\n<$A>  law\n\nma'am<,>\n\n There is something known to law as what we lawyers would call an\n\nequitable interest in property\n if for example there it happens in many\n\nways but for example I give you the extreme example\n\n\n Technically you're the legal owner but in fact I am the equitable\n\nand beneficial owner<,> because my money was what bought the\n\nproperty and if you refuse to give me that property I can take you to\n\ncourt<,> and as long as I can prove to the court that it is my\n\nmoney that bought the property the court will say that I am the\n\nowner<,>\n It's called an equitable owner\n Well as between men and women what does that mean\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Hm\n\n<$A>  but it doesn't change the\n\nissue<,>\n\n\nproperty act<,> whereby under that law at this time if a woman\n\nworks and contributes to the acquiring of property even if the man puts his\n\nname alone on it   she can take an action on the  married\n\nwoman's property act to have the court declare you're entitled to a half\n\na third or whatever it is that    you know the court\n\nuhm works out what you say your contribution is<,> and on that\n\nbasis make a ruling as to what your interest in that property is even though\n\nyour name is not on it\n you have the same rights\n\n\n you tell them\n\nthat<,,> the    the house is in this man who\n\nI lived with for thirteen years name<,>\n have children\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  No ma'am\n\n<$A>  You have no children\n\n<$B>  No\n\n<$A> \n While he lived there I've helped to buy the food\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Huh\n\n<$A>  While he lived there I've helped to by the food for both of us\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A>  Do you have your radio on\n\n<$B> \n to turn it off\n\n<$A>  I am uhm you know uh uh as I was saying cos this is very very\n\nimportant that women should know this<,> about their\n\nrights<,>\n the court\n while we lived\n\ntogether or I bought the food all the time or I paid the electricity all the\n\ntime\n paid the water rate I helped him to pay the\n\nmortgage<,>\n worked at X place I used to make X\n\namount a month\n I\n\nassisted in the acquiring of this property even though my name is not on the\n\ntitle\n I am asking you to make a declaration as to what my interest in\n\nthat property is<,>\n you have an\n\nentitlement<,> you need just to go to an\n\nattorney<,,> and brief them to take action in the Supreme Court\n\non your behalf to have the court declare that you have an interest in that\n\nproperty\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yes ma'am\n And there's another little problem you see ma'am\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$B>  he rented one of the\n\nroomto a lady<,>\n\n both\n\nthe mother and the two daughter they act like<,,> I'm not human\n\nbeing<,,>\n let me know that\n\nI don't rent them anyway so I cannot put them out\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nto seek the services of an attorney\n\n<$B>  Yes ma'am\n\n<$A>  Believe me uhm and put all of those issues to\n\nthem<,> because there are ways in which you can deal with this\n\nand you really need to let this gentleman understand   that\n\nthose days where you put your name on property and then take my money and pay\n\nthe mortgage and pay the light bill and eat my food and  can't\n\n<unclear> word(s)</unclear>  me help by  and then turn around and tell\n\nme that is not mine are over<,>\n You understand what I'm saying to you\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yes ma'am\n\n<$A>  And I'm going to say something to you ma'am as we walk into\n\nthe elections I'm hoping that women will start to ask of the politicians what\n\ndo you intend to do about making sure that if I live with somebody for\n\neighteen years I'm entitled to maintenance because I did all the housework\n\nand that is work and that deserves recognition\n These are the kind of things I want women to be asking the people\n\nwho are coming to them    to ask them for a vote\n\n  because the laws need a lot of improvement\n we still have rights there're still many\n\nmany things\n who\n\nmight marry a man or live with a man and get children and then find\n\nherself not being able to further her education\n When it comes to maintenance that must be taken as a part of the\n\nconsideration<,,>\n these are the things that we women\n\nreally need to continue to fight for in our legislation so that we will not\n\nbe taken advantage of<,,>\n relationships break up\n\nbut believe me ma'am you do have a case and you do need to go and get the\n\nservices of an attorney so that you can vindicate your rights\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Okay ma'am\n\n<$A>  Alright\n\n<$B>  Yes ma'am and have a good day\n\n<$A>  And the same to you ma'am\n to help you in this way\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n<$A>  Hello\n Hotline\n\n<$C>  Hello Mrs Haughton\n Good morning\n\n<$A>  Good morning\n How are you\n\n<$C>  Not bad Mrs Haughton\n\n man for the past six years\n\n I'm\n\nbeing told to get out of the house\n\n\nit's belongs  he was married first<,>\n\n\ndivorce<,> and then<,> you know we made it even <unclear>\n\nword(s)</unclear> that he was married<,> and we live together\n\nand we have one child<,> and now he's throwing out on the street\n\nwith a child\n at all\n I give him my whole life just to stay with this man\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Yes</[2</{2\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  What did you do during the relationship with him\n\n\n<$C>  No\n\n<$A>  I know\n You see ma'am this is\n\n<$C>  I couldn't because you see he\n\n<$A>  I understand\n I mean you had a small child and maybe it was difficult to work\n\nbut you see ma'am this is why we as women have to continue to struggle for\n\nthe improvement in the laws\n Right now I can't tell you what I told the other\n\nlady<,> because to this date household work is not treated by\n\nthe law as if it was work<,> because I suspect men made the law quite frankly\n I mean I have to be quite honest with you because you know that\n\nhousework is very hard work raising children is tremendously hard\n\nwork<,> and for the law to tell you that that is not\n\ncontribution and that does not give you any entitlement is very sad\n that there is draft legislation on the way\n\nto improve the situation but we still need even more improvement because we\n\nneed a maintenance law that recognizes that people who live together have\n\nmaintenance rights as between them<,>\n In other words you don't have to be formally married to ask a\n\nmaintenance right\n Maintenance rights depend upon living together providing certain\n\nhousehold services contributing to a family to a family situation\n It is not based on the formality of being married\n as a piece of draft\n\nlegislation and maintenance legislation that does that\n But we as women as we go into the international woman's day by the\n\neight of march we must continue to struggle to protect ourselves\n Look at you\n You have a child with this man\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  Yes ma'am\n\n<$A> \n\ntomorrow he comes and tosses you<,> out maybe so that he can keep the\n\nchild<,>\n You never know\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  you see the thing is\n\nthis    he cannot if I go to work I'll you see \n\n  I'm only going out there to look\n\n\n<$A>  don't want you work\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  telling you\n And the law don't recognize when a man doesn't want a woman to\n\nwork to say well therefore as a natural corollary of this you uh become\n\nentitled to maintenance by virtue of the fact that  \n\n you and this person have entered into an arrangement whereby you\n\ndon't work for whatever reason\n can't have it\n They don't want you to work and at the same time\n\n<$C>  Don't want me to talk to anybody\n Don't want me to go nowhere\n even the gate\n\n<$A>  But you're a child ma'am\n This man has made you into a child\n You need to make up your mind whether you want to be a grown\n\nperson or somebody\x18s child because only my child I can tell not to go to the\n\ngate\n\n<$C>  the\n\n<unclear> word(s)</unclear> for my mother it's a problem because    he's saying that I'm going back    to\n\na man you know or something   of that\n\n<$A>  very sorry for that gentleman you know\n\nbecause if a lady has decided to see somebody else there nothing you can do\n\nshort of being her blouse<,> to stop her\n So these men who uh uh women too and there're women like that too\n\nwho become very silly about this and believe that they can walk and follow\n\npeople and watch and make people's life miserable by   \n\na sort of unnatural jealousy as far as I'm concerned\n Is just being ridiculous ma'am because quite frankly if a human\n\nbeing has made up  their mind to do something that is out of line with\n\nthe relationship they will do it\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  But Miss Haughton you see the thing is this\n\n I uh you see I don't even see the reason why I should\n\n<$A>  That is the point I'm trying to make to you ma'am\n\n\n It must be based on trust\n So in other words if you don't trust somebody you can't watch\n\nthem<,> and you can't make them into a prisoner<,,>\n A relationship is something that must operate on the basis of\n\ntrust you know\n And you have to make up your mind whether you are prepared to be\n\nthis gentleman's child or prisoner because it really sounds very unhealthy to\n\nme ma'am\n I'm telling you the truth", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd993bc0e-9cb9-4c05-aa93-0e0608da1720', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:52.218340+00:00', 'english_score':

you went to   \n\na doctor in China<,> his examination might involve\n\ntaking a history that\'s asking about your complaints<,> looking\n\nat your tongue and looking at your fingernails<,> and feeling\n\nyour pulse<,> and just from doing those things he often is able\n\nto make a very accurate analysis of your state of health<,>\n examining the fingernails can tell\n\na lot about things like the circulation about whether you are anaemic or\n\nnot<,> about whether your body might be lacking in certain\n\nminerals about what potential problems with your hormones\n There\'s a tremendous

would then look at the whole picture the other aspects of\n\nyou<,> okay to use that in conjunction what he finds from\n\nlooking at the nails to come up with potential diagnosis or close

\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  doctor\n\n\n<$A>  Well\n\n\nmentioned to you\n a little\n\nginger<,>\n Yeah\n As a home remedy that might be useful in very mild cases of\n\ntinnitus<,>\n Alright\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Well thank you very much\n\n<$A>  Alright bye now\n\n<$B>  Bye-bye\n\n<$A>  Hello\n\n<$C>  Hello Good\n\n<$A>  Good evening\n\n<$C>  Good evening\n\n<$A>  How you\'re doing this evening\n\n<$C>  Okay uhm\n\n<$A>  You don\'t sound okay\n You say okay\n You sound low\n What\'s wrong\n\n<$C>  on the programme\n\n<$A>  Mhm\n Welcome\n\n<$C> \n\nnight stress<,>\n I seems to be having that problem\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n doesn\'t sound good\n What\'s wrong\n\n<$C>  Mhm\n\n\n<$C> \n\nhyperthyroidism<,>\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$A>  Hyper or hypo\n\n\n<$C>  Hyperthyroid\n\n<$A> \n I see aha\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  And I have hypertension\n\n<$A> \n And how long have these things been affecting you\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  Uhm about five years now\n\n<$A>  Five years\n\n<$C>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  And how is it being managed\n What\'s being done about it\n\n<$C>  Uhm\n Well I\'m on medication for the thyroid and uh\n\nhypertension<,> but the problem is this\n Uhm you know since I have this constant headache and sometime when\n\nI     I think it is the pressure\n The doctor says isn\'t the pressure\n I keep going to the doctors over and over because you know I\n\ncannot get this feelings  \n\nand all kind of different kind of feelings like\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  me ask you\n\nsomething<,>\n and the\n\nmedication for the blood pressure<,>   has there been\n\nany recommendations given to you about your diet or about taking any\n\nkind of nutritional supplements\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\nchild-speaking-in-background\n\n<$C>  No\n\n<$A>  Okay\n See now what is happening is that you\'re having drugs prescribed\n\nto treat your symptoms<,> which may be necessary<,>\n But my contention is that you also need to do a number of other\n\nthings to assist your body heal to assist your body correct the imbalances\n\nthat\'s developing\n So even if you are taking the medication you might well need to\n\n<unclear> word</unclear> the medication I find that you feel a lot better\n\nthat your body will react a lot better if in addition to that you were taking\n\nthe appropriate nutritional supplements\n There\'re some vitamins some minerals some supplements that I think\n\nis absolutely essential for you to be on in addition to the medicine you take\n\nbecause very often I have found that when you do that you need less and less\n\nmedicine<,> because your body is now be able to work at\n\ncorrecting the imbalances that\'s there<,>\n\n So my recommendation would be that in addition to what you\'re\n\ndoing you need some help with your nutrition\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  Yeah\n I\n\ncannot sleep      at night\n\n<$A>  I hear it in your voice\n You don\'t sound good to me\n\n<$C>  Yeah\n\n<$C>  Where you\'re calling from\n\n<$C>  Uhm Kingston\n\n<$A>  Kingston\n\n for you\n\nto call tomorrow for us to give you some advice some information about how\n\nyou can start nourishing your body<,> in a particular kind of\n\nway<,> to help correct these problems for you<,>\n\n hold on I\'m gonna give you some numbers\n\nfor you to call<,>\n\n Alright\n\n Let\'s go to the break and then we come back\n We talk to some more of you\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n our next caller\n Hello\n\n<$D>  Yeah doctor\n\n<$A>  Hi there\n\n<$D>  Good night Sir\n\n<$A>  Night Night\n\n<$D>  thing\n\nthat she took for the sinus problem and the asthmatic problem for her\n\nchildren<,>\n tablet\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  herbal\n\nsupplements in tablet form<,> that we use very frequently for\n\npeople with allergies and sinus problems and those kinds of things like\n\nasthma<,> because they\'re actually<,> powerful<,> herbal<,>\n\nantioxidants<,> things that help to deal with inflammation and\n\ncongestion and so on\n The two she was referring to was a Chinese herb called "\n\nSchizendre"<,> S C H I Z E N D R E it comes in a tablet\n\nform<,> and the other one was   uhm  a\n\nherbal- based tablet that\'s made from the herbal rosemary\n\n\n uhm are combined in this tablet that\'s called\n\n" Rosox"<,> R O S O X<,>\n So we often use the combination of this Schizendre Plus\n berry found in\n\nChina<,> and it\'s combined with some other herbs and vitamins\n\nin that tablet called " Schizendre Plus"\n And we combined with this rosemary extract called "\n\nRosox"<,> and it\'s been incredibly useful in helping\n\npeople with those kinds of problems\n In addition to that we encourage them very strongly to change\n\ntheir diet<,> particularly to eliminate\n\ndairy<,>\n Researchers say that dairy products are the commonest food\n\nallergies that we face\n So dairy not only causes allergic reactions but it also causes an\n\nexcess production of <unclear> word<unclear> in the body\n a dairy\n\nbreak from the diet and going on    these\n\nsupplements have been very very helpful for people with that kind of problem\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\nword</unclear>\n\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D>  Aha\n\n<$A>  Alright\n\n<$D> \n\nit combined <unclear> word</unclear> one tablet\n\n<$A>  with\n\nthe rosemary and the other one with the Schizendre<,>\n And they will tell how you would use them\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D>  Okay\n\n uhm problem with the\n\nprostate<,> and you go to the doctor and do the examination and\n\nthe doctor say that you have uhm what\'s <unclear> words</unclear>\n\nenlarge<,> large Yes and that the doctor say me to do test like\n\nurine test and blood test\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  the doctor will do if he examines and he finds that\n\nyour prostate is enlarged<,> the enlargement can be due to a\n\nnumber of different things and the test he does on you is designed to help\n\nhim decide what is the underlying problem<,>\n For example there can be an infection or a inflammation in the\n\nprostate<,>/[3> that\'s called " prostatitis" an\n\ninflammation of the prostate gland<,>\n Secondly there can be an enlargement of the prostate that can\n\nbe<,> non<,>-cancerous\n Not due to cancer just a general enlargement that we call\n\n" B P H" or " benign<,> prostatic<,>\n\nhypertrophy"\n long medical name but it means\n\nthat the prostate is    enlarged but it\'s\n\nnot cancered and thirdly<,> it could be enlarged because of\n\ncancer  ,\n very very important for the doctor to decide what\'s the\n\nproblem in your case\n So all the tests he does the urine test the blood test sometimes\n\nthe ultra-sound are all designed to help him decide what really is the\n\nunderlying problem\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D>  Okay\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$D>  Okay doctor\n\n<$A>  But whatever the underlying problem is there\'re a number of\n\ngeneral things that you should be doing to keep your prostate healthy\n\n<$D>  Like\n\n<$A>  Like your diet\n\n<$D>  Okay\n\n<$A>  You must dramatically reduce your intake of animal\n\nfats<,>\n You must increase your intake of a food called "\n\nsoy"\n S O Y\n And I recommend people\'s diet having daily soy-based shakes\n You must increase your intake of a vegetable extract called\n\n" Lycopene" that\'s found in tomatoes<,>\n And then there\'re other herbs that are helpful for the prostate\n Things like saw palmetto and stinging-nettle and pygeum and\n\npumpkin seed and zinc\n There a whole host of nutrients that are good for the prostate\n So there\'s a little programme that I recommend for people to help\n\nkeep the prostate healthy\n\n\noccur\n Here\'s a product call " Ultimate Prostate" that I\n\nrecommend to all men particuarly if you\'re over fourty to protect your\n\nprostate gland\n We recommend the protein shakes I recommend certain vitamins\n A programme to keep your prostate healthy don\'t wait until it\n\nget\'s sick\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D>  Yes\n\n<$A>  Alright\n\n<$D>  Okay\n\n<$A>  So you can always call our centre if you hold on we\'ll give\n\nyou some telephone numbers where you can get some advice about how to begin\n\nto take nutrition to protect your prostate\n\n<$D>  Okay

{'text': "<$Z> \n Yeah\n on the programme for this section is what a\n\n sort of context resulted in the emergence of creole languages and now\n\nI'm talking about  you\n Can you provide a bit of detail of that sort of context\n\n\n<$A>  enslavement and\n\nuhm<,,>    cannot incompatible with the pidgin that they started\n\nto really realise and under the presence  of people that were\n\nimportant\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$C>  just to\n\nsay slavery alone<,> probably is not enough because I\n\ncould easily say that uhm    the    reality of enslavement<(=> argues against\n\ncreolisation<,> because why wouldn't you or why on earth do you\n\nwant to adopt another language after somebody    the social background of \n\npractically every region contribute    to what\n\nhappened to the language\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$D> \n\nculturally different\n\n\nBarbados and uhm that has created some difference in the way language is used\n\nin these two areas as in uh Barbados they have what  it/is seemed to\n\nbe a form of   uhm  English while we in\n\nJamaica here have a continuum\n\n<$Z> \n Mhm\n So how does that relate\n\n\nan  a necessary and sufficient condition for the emergence of\n\nCreole\n What does the Barbados case tell us about that\n\n\n<$D> \n Yes there was enslavement\n\n<$C> \n\n<$D> \n\ntwo-or-three-words</unclear>  but uhm<,>  ,\n\n\nto to the language  to the use of language and\n\nthings\n\n<$C> \n\n<$Z> \n Aha\n\n\n<$D> \n\n<,> contact\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$D> \n\n<$Z> \n\n\nyou're you're you're way too   you're generalising way\n\ntoo much\n\n\n<$D> \n\n<$E>  Well uhm I think that enslavement helped for the formation of\n\ncreole but uhm there's the conditions on different plantations are the ones\n\nthat lead to uhm different forms of creole    in uhm\n\nfor example in Barbados or as you said the Spanish Islands they had really\n\nuhm a creole as such because the conditions were  near as a/uh the\n\nratio <unclear> two-or-three-words</unclear> and that were kind of similar\n\nwhereas in islands like Jamaica Guyana there were different ratios and then\n\nas <unclear> several- words</unclear> of    the\n\nislands also contributed    to\n\ncreoles<,> in terms of uhm<,,>  \n\n I think Barbados    is not as hilly\n\nas Jamaica<,> so there were people that were together whereas in Jamaica when\n\nfor example when the  Maroons escaped they were kind like isolated and\n\nthat you know   that contributed to <unclear> word(s)</unclear>\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n is a special case right\n Let's just stick to the plantations themselves\n What sorts of contacts would have been realistic between\n\nplantations\n\n<$D>  You mean on one island\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$G> \n\n   the slave\n\n<$Z> \n\n\nplantations<,> from one plantation to the next\n\n<$G> \n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word</unclear> uhm some like a slave master on his plantation\n\nwould've resold his slave to another plantation<,>  where it\n\nwasn't like on such a large  scheme that a creole would develop\n\nand\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\nGabrielle was saying that the demographics Barbados being relatively\n\nsmall no uh mountainous areas which suggests not only that the whole\n\ncommunity would have had a hard time to uh establish itself but also that\n\nthere would have been more contact towards the island\n\n\n<$F> \n\n<$Z> \n\n\n\n\narchitects eh that would have been one\n\n<$A>  Yeah yeah\n\n<$F> \n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$F> \n\nusing the Creoles\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n From one plantation to the next\n Okay\n purpose would domestic\n\nslaves communicate    with people domestic slaves\n\nfrom the next plantation\n\n<$F> \n Is that possible\n\n<$Z> \n\n Well\n Okay we're not talking about covert possibilities but about overt\n\nlegal let's say  constellations/possibilities\n\n\nsell <unclear> word</unclear> right <unclear> words</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Yes Yes\n\n\n<$Z> \n So you think anything about\n\nthose\n\n<$C> \n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  or\n\na Saturday market\n Yeah\n That was a day when the slaves were allowed to go to market\n\n<$F> \n\n<$Z> \n Holidays\n Thank you yes\n\n\n<$F> \n\nentertainment\n\n<$A> \n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$F>  entertainments like\n\ndance\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$B> \n\nword(s)</unclear>\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n\nbecause you know you get to meet people in a complex<,,>\n in terms of uhm a situation where people were free to\n\nwork on a plantation and Creole emerged uhm there is the famous case of\n\nHawaii<,> which uh we're going to look into a bit uh next week and I want you\n\nto keep that in mind Hawaii so what were reasons in case of the plantation\n\nsociety the people who worked on the plantations there were free they came\n\nfrom different territories and the vernacular of Hawaii is a Creole language\n\nthat emerged in other contexts\n So enslavement as such is not a necessary or condition for uh\n\ncreole emergenceUhm let's just see what\n\nsorts of readings have been done\n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B> \n\narticle\n\n<$Z> \n\n\ntwo-or-three-words</unclear>\n\n<$B>  Well basically it's mostly about how Creoles came about and\n\neventually that  <- > the definition  the traditional\n\ndefinition of Creole given priority uhm wasn't sufficient to    define the <unclear> word</unclear>\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$B>  you know the\n\ndefinition is  <- > a  a Creole is a pidgin that\n\nbecomes a native language of a speech community<,> which is a \n\n  very I think  this is I tell you <unclear>\n\nword(s)</unclear> tell you  that/all the criteria about <unclear>\n\nwords</unclear> and<,,>\n There he says that there are a lot of social and cultural\n\nfunctions which Creole plays and therefore   \n\nin that sense by saying that it just developed from a pidgin and it's\n\njust    a <unclear> several-words</unclear> \n\nacquainted <unclear> one-or-two- words</unclear> there are criteria that\n\nin forms\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  if\n\nour language is the native language of a community  <,> no no no  \n\ndoesn't it mean that uhm<,> it would serve a social and cultural\n\npurpose\n\n<$F> \n\n<$C>  Yes\n\n\n argue let's say is a pidgin but people  wanna know to\n\nspeak it people grow up speaking Tok Pisin and they argue it's a pidgin\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$C>  Uh because it's just a trade in Papua New Guinea\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$C>  Trade language\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  People grow up speaking it\n\n<$C> \n\ngrow up   <unclear> words</unclear>\n\n<$B>  are treated to trade with\n\nthis\n\n<$Z> \n If it's just a trade language why would people grow up and speak\n\nit<,>\n know anything more\n\nabout Tok Pisin\n\n<$C> \n\n<$B>  I used the last lesson but I\n\n<$Z> \n\n\nis very shortened is it\n\n<$B>  Not usually but I think since this passage it has been\n So a little word\n\n<$Z> \n Alright\n I don't think that's the correct representation of the Tok Pisin\n\ncase\n So why don't you look at it again and tell us more next\n\nweek\n critique of the definition of\n\nCreole what does the critique  langue consist of\n\n<$B> \n\nloads of them as I said\n\n<$Z> \n No I don't care about name here what does the critique consist\n\nof\n\n<$B>  Oh Uhm the constituting aspects of Creole the social\n\naspects<,,> uhm functional aspects or the Creole shift  be <unclear>\n\nword</unclear>\n So I can't say\n\n<$Z> \n Okay\n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$G> \n\nthe demographic factors and  information design\n\n<$Z> \n by who again\n\n<$G>  Irons\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$G> \n\nbackground uhm <unclear> words</unclear> say that the period of slavery \n\n  in the area he traces the<,> pattern of<,> shipment of\n\nslaves from Africa into Surinam over centrified European<,,> but\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$G>  it was in the\n\neighteenth century\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$G>  Seventeenth to eighteenth century\n Sorry\n Right\n that the contributing factors to the\n\nformation of Creole<,> and<,> I think the most outstanding thing that stands\n\nout  in my mind    is that in the\n\nformation of creoles<,,> uhm it was difficult for a native talk to the\n\ndevelop thing because    the colonisers kept on the\n\nDutch they kept on bringing in new shipments of African slaves and over a\n\nperiod of uh one hundred years it was found that there was no development of\n\na native tongue because<,> they either<,,>  pressed this guide or \n\n  they used slaves  ordinarily they bought\n\nslaves\n it was\n\nfound that the dominant language would not have been a native tongue\n\nbut one of the incoming slaves but the languages that developed<,,> uh\n What he said there is substrate influence on Surinam and the\n\nother Surinam Creoles are    Kikongo and \n\nGbe<,> those were the two uhm forms at the top <unclear>\n\nword(s)</unclear> formation <unclear> word</unclear>\n But where some other languages had secondary influence we're as\n\nsupposed the slaves came from and he said that slaves from areas that\n\n<unclear> words</unclear> caused very much of the influence on the formation\n\nof Creoles because they came in  a lot of/the better part of    the slave  machinery\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n Doesn't that contradict a bit what he says about the fact that\n\nCreole did not actually develop<,> during all this time<,,>\n I get the impression from your summary that he says that African\n\nlanguages that were present in the earlier period Kikongo and Gbe had more\n\ninfluence on the    Creoles that developed in\n\nSurinam than the language that came later\n But at the same time he says Creole did not develop because there\n\nwere too many new people<,>\n\n<$G>  explained that why\n\nthese languages survived as opposed to the new forms was that even though\n\nthese younger generations who were coming in they were under the influence of\n\nolder persons and they were often in the care of a mother-figure who has\n\nknown the older forms  of them\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$G>  was being\n\ntransmitted to the younger generation cause these persons    were in    the\n\ncare of the Caribbeans during that time\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$G>  And many of the persons who came here they died they didn't\n\ncome along<,> <unclear> word</unclear>\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n\n<$G>  he said\n\nthat    most children will <unclear>\n\nword</unclear> at the age of<,> I think it was ten<,>  \n\n  within about the age of ten\n\n\nit's thirty- seven<,> and<,,>\n So there was an ongoing stream of cultural and linguistic input\n\nfrom Africa  <,>  until the\n\nlast half of the eighteenth century<,,>\n\n I'm finished\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$G>  Yes\n\n<$Z> \nUhm\n\n\nconstruations in  the critique/agreement\n\n<$G> \n\nturn-over of slaves uhm in areas I think<,> in areas like Jamaica where I\n\nhear that the conditions were inhuman  there you may/the human have\n\nmore slaves <unclear> word</unclear> so as a result of that the colonisers\n\nwould have to import more slaves which means that they would bring in their\n\nnew languages and that would affect  creolization\n\n<$Z> \n in\n\nSurinam might be comparable to that in   Jamaica where \n\nthere's a relatively short life expectancy\n We all live in territories where the situation might have been\n\nbetter\n\n<$G> \n\n<$C>  In terms of life expectancy\n\n<$Z> \n Mhm\n But also in terms uhm of the numbers of African-born not\n\nnecessarily outnumbering the number of people who were already there\n there\n\nwere always more new people than yeah \n\n<$G> \n\n\n<$G> \n\n<unclear> word</unclear> where    they

\n\n\n<$E>  just think the size of uh\n\n   the island    will\n\nmatter more uh than the size of the plantations themselves right\n\nbecause    the size of the island uhm I mean there\n\nthey have sugar from this uhm is a business so you want to use up as much as\n\nland as you can<,> <unclear> word(s)</unclear> so in terms like\n\n when they had probably they have used up as many as you can for sugar\n\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$C>  really\n\nthought about that <unclear> word</unclear> because very possible that\n\nHaiti was this big country which treated the plantation and Martinique was\n\nthis little country with one big plantation\n\n\n  Martinique itself ya so you know    a big plantation you know and then \n\ndown/double influence <unclear> words</unclear> knows that slaves which\n\n<unclear> word</unclear> sure <unclear> words</unclear>  \n\n because how big the  places/place is and  their/there\n\nare small plantations they would have <unclear> word</unclear> just\n\ndoesn't want  deliver\n\n<$Z> \n Right\n We know places like Guyana uhm which is bigger than Jamaica\n\nFrench Guyana which is bigger than Jamaica have a little <unclear>\n\nword</unclear> due to the plantations\n\n<$E> \n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$E> \n\n<$Z> \n compare\n\nto British Guyana\n\n<$E> \n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$E> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$E>  remember this\n I don't know\n\n<$Z> \n No\n nothing about what the\n\n west coast of South America  is right\n\n<$E>  No\n\n<$C>  Get\n\ndrunk\n\n<$G>  There are a lot of rivers\n\n<$Z> \n A lot of rivers yes\n\n What do you think are\n A swamp\n\n that's a feature that the\n\nthree Guyanas have in common    and yet    the Dutch and the English did more in terms of\n\nplantations than did the French \n\n<$E> \n\n\n<$G>  Uhm Silvia\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$G>  the same with\n\nregards to size of plantation and number<,> right because if you have a\n\ncountry that has sorry three large plantations a big country\n\nthat has three large plantations and there you

opinion somewhere in the middle\n We also use the phrase believing in reject the idea of varying\n\ndegrees\n\n\n must be absolutely convinced of what one believes\n Anything less may be designated as opinion\n We're almost certain et cetera but not believe\n English language epistemologists have identified four basic source\n\nof evidence perception self-consciousness memory and testimony\n Believe is an area where the theory of knowledge and moral\n\nphilosophy overlap\n If a belief held on the basis of second-hand testimony and\n\nsubsequently first  tried by personal experience    the

and not agreeing\n This would be a situation in which the hearer feels he understands\n\nmeaning he   gbo what is being said but he refuses\n\nto accept<,>\n The second type is not hearing and not

\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n Okay\n just by\n\nmere uhm<,> oral expression but  <,> \n\nyou haven't uhm tested it<,> you haven't conducted any\n\nsearch or something   you know     \n\nand you

in the\n\nsituation you have experienced it\n knowledge in English you could get from a\n\nbook<,> or a person or whatever that is the difference between\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n when you get

because it could be edited to <unclear> word</unclear>\n\nwhat the reporter is saying<,> then it is not in fact the truth\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n Okay\n\n\n<$F>  in uhm from what the\n\npresenter<,> talked about   \n\nYoruba that somehow    their concept of\n\nknowledge therefore is uh  <- >  limited uhm<,> whereas<,> if you take for example a\n\n<unclear> word</unclear> system then<,> uhm \n\ntheir concept of knowledge would probably not work fully except if\n\n  you're talking about the  irate of  , \n\nbelieving\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n They're saying if you claim to

\n\n\n<$F> \n\n<$Z> \n So then what do you make of uh oral tradition where we get a lot\n\nof you know remember we were talking about myth that you know class over\n\nthere\n do you make of oral tradition\n\nwhere you know stories you know you read you know about stories of about you\n\nknow heroes    and uhm you know legends and    you know about\n\n<$A>  is that you don't even\n\nhave a story about <unclear> word(s)</unclear>\n If it can be proven that it was in fact so then it would\n\nbe<,>    you knowing that\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  Once it can be tested and proven it is knowledge\n\nthat<,> and meaning I know\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n it is\n\nknowledge that\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n cause a fact would be knowledge\n\n  you know it from different facts\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n Okay\n So then uh uh you know\n What would you say are the main differences between uh the Yoruba\n\nepistemology in this case uh you know African epistemology and the way uh\n\nversus the you know   uhm uhm<,> English<,>\n\nnotion\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  is more of what we would\n\nthink to be knowledge<,> they would put in\n\nbelieve<,>  gbagbo because it is only when we\n\ncan say knowledge that in English cause it would be like you experiences\n\nwould be  towards their  mo because you have in\n\nfact been in a situation to claim that  mo something\n\n<unclear> word</unclear> knowledge by acquaintance or knowing how to would be\n\n gbagbo to them<,>\n\n\nas to how\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$Z> \n Are there

that\n\nuhm like our understanding    of knowledge uhm<,> I\n\nguess uhm true knowledge probably comes without hard facts<,>\n\nbut not when it is<,> reported to you<,>\nwhen\n\nit's when

{'text': "<$A> \n So we had a holiday yesterday and that is perhaps one of the reasons\n\nwhy we don't have a presenter<,> today<,>\n The topic for today is what is Aristotle's concept of the soul and\n\nhow does it differ from Plato's<,> concept of the soul<,>\n And in the absence of Ronda, we will discuss the topic generally\n\n Okay,\n and compare\n\nthem\n\n\n from whom Socrates gained\n\nmuch inspiration there's the view that the soul could transmigrate\n\n the soul was something that existed apart from the\n\nbody<,,>\n\n\nexistence<,,>\n\n It was a part of the structure and functioning of the body\n A soul for him cannot exist without a body\n soul is diffused throughout the\n\nbody\n body\n\nmind soul you know\n Mind and soul are regarded by some as the same thing\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C> \n\n\n<$D> \n\n<$A>  There is\n\n<$C> \n\nthat  that it actually exists in a disembodied state\n speaks of the soul\n\nexisting in another physical entity like for example reincarnation\n a form like an animal\n\n\n<$A>  of the transmigration of soul\n\nconcept<,> that the soul can occupy<,> another body\n migrates to another body\n\n<$C>  But I would like to know Sir do you say that what happened to\n\nthe soul that was in a body that the other soul migrates to<,,>\n\n\n<$A> \n\ndisplacement\n not one of\n\ndisplacement where I'm a free soul and my body is dead and so I decide to\n\ntake over your body\n concept\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  The concept is in the case of reincarnation that a new body is\n\nborn emerges<,> and this soul<,> occupies that body<,> or this\n\nbody is born for the purpose of<,> taking on this soul<,,>\n That's the idea of reincarnation\n there\n\nis a feeling that    the spirit world is like an\n\nocean<,>\n And the souls are like drops of water in that ocean\n So that you can merge with the central body\n You can merge with the ocean and lose your identity but that is a\n\nreligious belief\n But Christians don't share that view\n\n A person and a body can be separated\n\n\n\n\nextinguished<,>\n do you think of\n\nthat\n\n<$C> \n\n<$D>  has two\n\nparts<,,>   not two parts but we have two  entity body you\n\nhave the physical the mortal  bit/flick and you have this\n\n what is done to the body may not\n\nnecessarily affect what is done to the spirit\n the\n\nspirit lives on\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Describe the spirit that lives on\n\n<$D> \n\n  what would you say now uhm  \n\nuhm defiant<,> that defiant part    of any human\n\nbeing that is able to overcome the odds or overcome   \n\nphysical harm\n So you can kill the spirit and not kill the body\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$D>  Yeah I think so\n is the\n\nthing    that adds the human quality\n\n<$A>  Okay\n not\n\nnot  ,   not something<,>\n\ntangible<,>\n\n\nor do we speak of something identified as soul\n According to Plato tell me according to Plato\n\n\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> soul is our real self an\n\nincorruptible spiritual entity radically different from and opposed to the\n\nheart so the soul to him is the spirit\n\n<$A> \n\nthe spirit\n\n<$C>  Mhm\n says that it's immortal\n\n<$A>  It's immortal\n the\n\nmanifestation of    the senses\n The hearing smelling and feeling and so on\n To what do we attribute those\n have these qualities\n\nthe qualities of hearing and seeing and tasting and smelling and<,> feeling\n\n<$C> \n\n  the mind is a faculty of the\n\nsoul<,>    these experiences first\n\noccur in the mind and are manifested to the  <- > physical<,> \n\nphysical functions\n So in other words to Plato the spirit will have all those qualities\n\n So in the mind if you think that the mind uhm all those functions\n\nbegin in the mind and you're saying that Plato he managed to <unclear>\n\nword</unclear> the spirit then yes the spirit will be part of these qualities\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\ns\n\n<$A> \n\nentities\n\n<$C>  No\n speaking as Plato says that\n\n   they're going to a    circle\n\nbut  they're just\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  So how does Aristotle's argument relate to that\n\n<$C> \n Uhm I would say so that he had a different notion of the soul he\n\nbelieves that the mind is a faculty of the soul but the soul is not a\n\nspiritual principle imprisoned in a body as a bird in a cage\n\n The soul is the principle of organisation of any human being\n\n\nhighest activity <unclear> word(s)</unclear>\n\n<$A>  What is the form of the body\n\n<$C>  a man's soul is his life\n So he say uhm\n\n<$A>  what's the difference\n What difference does he make between the soul and the body\n\n<$C>  Between the soul and the body\n He doesn't really make any\n\n Yeah\n He says that the soul isn't necessary for existence of human being\n\n<$D> \n\n<$A>  so\n\nthat    the soul can experience the functions of the\n\nsense organs\n Is that what you're saying\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  Yes\n He's able to reason\n\n<$A>  have to be careful\n\nwhen you speak of forms because remember Plato's world of forms where Plato\n\nfelt that there is a world of forms that contains the perfect creation<,>\n\nthat man<,> is a<,> replica<,> of the original form the perfect form\n Aristotle came by and he was Plato's student as you know and he\n\nrefuted that\n\n You are the original\n There's no world of form\n\n You are the original\n I can see you and touch you\n\n\n\n the\n\ntwo arguments between Plato's argument and Aristotle's argument in so far as\n\nthe soul is concerned\n What's the real difference between the two arguments\n\n<$C>  that uhm Aristotle's concept does\n\nalone form an issue of the disembodied self<,> while Plato's\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  the\n\nsoul also dies  ,\n concept of\n\nsoul<,>\n or specifically a\n\nsoul cannot exist without the body<,,>\n\n<$C>  The soul\n Yeah\n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$D> \n\n isn't that true to an extent\n if\n\nwe're going to say if we're going to disagree with him and say\n\nalright if the body dies the soul lives on    what does the soul<,> does it roam does\n\nit<,>\n\n\nborn out    in people's seeing   uhm ghosts and spirits and\n\n<$A>  True\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n,\n\nsoul\n\n<$C> \n I think what she's asking is what happens to the soul if\n\ndisembodied  mind is alone\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n smell   and hear and touch<,>\n\n Do you subscribe to it\n\n<$D> \n\n<$C>  Displacement\n\n\n<$D> \n\n<$C> \n\nwas watching a movie<,> on the weekend and    it was all about out of body experiences and it had the\n\nconcept was that  were this young man who was able to see ghosts right\n\nand    you're thinking  \n\n that the soul would be a part of the ghost right but all the\n\nghost them could see them could talk them could walk you understand\n I mean if you're\n\nthinking of the soul as    lacking all\n\nthose properties and even when he himself had a out of body experience\n\nbecause there's a part of the movie    where \n\nhe had    a doctor friend and she lowered his uhm\n\nheart rate and keep it in a freezer and he have a out of body experience and\n\n   he himself is just uh uh    he came back as a physical being too understand\n So\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  that your concept of the\n\nfunction of the soul\n\n<$C>  To do what\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  I\n\nthink   if<,></- >  I think if you're going to argue for\n\na disembodied    the soul then has to have\n\nphysical characteristics    as well as mental\n\n<$D> \n\n<$A>  physical\n\ncharacteristics<,> as well as mental<,>\n So that the soul can function physically without a\n\nbody<,>\n What do you think of that\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>

{'text': "<$A>  Alright let me just put these things over so that I do not\n\nuhm<,,> get my things mixed up<,>\n let's go\n\n<$B>  Alright I did what I went online and I looked up like how to do\n\nthe formal outline  ,  how to do the outline  ,\n\n and they told me to do it in like a order like this\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n Alright so you are using upper case letters for the major sections\n\nof the essay<,>\n of the\n\nessay\n Alright let's look at the thesis statement\n In the ever evolving world of superpowers countries and\n\ngroups of individuals are arising that have no regard for human life\n They are called terrorists and these groups have changed the world\n\nforever in a world where security and safety is of utmost importance\n Although you have used commas right it is very obvious that there\n\nis a break right here for a full stop   alright\n Now we suggest that you try to write the thesis statement in one\n\nsentence right\n It's a sentence that essentially sums up the entire essay right\n When I read your thesis statement I must literally have an idea of\n\nwhat this essay is about\n\n It should be general enough to incorporate all the issues that you\n\nwant to deal with but specific enough to give direction to the particular\n\nessay   alright\n The topic you are writing on is bioterrorism\n Is it that the topic you are doing\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A> \n So then if you're looking at bioterrorism you don't want any kind\n\nof preamble\n You really want to get into the subject of what bioterrorism is\n\nright\n So first you must have a good working definition of bioterrorism\n\n  right\n You want to move into that and having done that right you want to\n\nintroduce the issues related to bioterrorism which you are going to be\n\ndeveloping in the essay<,>\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  First then I started out uhm kind of broad with terrorism on a\n\nwhole and then this would be like in the introduction and then I would have\n\nthese three paragraphs here coming down   into bioterrorism and\n\nthen<,>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  For this essay you really don't need uh\n\n\n  I wouldn't use that approach uhm\n in this ever evolving world of\n\nsuperpowers countries and groups of individuals are arising to have no regard\n\nfor human life\n They are called terrorists and these groups have changed the world\n\nforever in a world where security and safety is of utmost importance\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Mhm\n\n<$A>  How would you proceed\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  to leave\n\nout some of this information here\n The sentence is too long\n You have a natural break for a full stop but you are not using the\n\nnatural break because you want it to be one sentence as it is supposed to\n\nbe<,>\n But it is not natural that this is one sentence as you have it\n\n Right\n security\n\nand safety is of utmost importance\n Mhm\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Security and safety is of utmost\n\nimportance\n\n<$B>  talk about there are\n\nindividuals arising group of individuals that<,> are   compromising\n\nsecurity or something like that<,>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n in your thesis statement<,> right\n So how are you going to incorporate that word into your thesis\n\nstatement\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  uhm I think in that case I would have to probably\n\nrearrange or totally change the thesis statement\n\n<$A>  I think that that's how you're gonna have to do\n\nit<,> but let me see how you proceeded uhm<,,>\n\n Now try to keep away from asking questions in the outline right\n Use short phrases\n You kind of decide what you're going to do\n if\n\nyou're using short phrases for your major sections  \n\nthen they should be short phrases right through  , \n\nright\n Some should not be questions some short phrases some sentences et\n\ncetera\n\n\noutline main points that will be discussed\n and\n\nwhat exactly it is or is it  ,  bioterrorism is effective\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Mhm\n of bioterrorism and so on long term\n\neffects in species formation et cetera and conclusion\n Uhm what you need to do restructure the thesis\n\nstatement<,>\n Give me an idea of what will be in your introduction\n and\n\nsecondly this section of your essay right<,>    it says you're going to look at the main points that\n\nwill be discussed\n You're not going to put it like that\n what is this main\n\nsection of your essay about right\n Having given it that title you can now decide that in section B of\n\nthe essay I am going to be looking at these three main issues<,>\n\nwhich you can call one two and three<,> or    you could put it this way one Roman\n\nnumeral two Roman   numeral three\n So but this is quite consistent so you could use this pattern right\n\n\neach main heading<,> in order to break out your plan to make it\n\nas detailed as possible you can now break that down each of these  \n\ncan be broken down further and you could say under A there are two or\n\nthree minor ideas which you wish to discuss<,> and you can\n\neven break down those minor ideas a little   bit more\n The more detailed your plan is right the more capable you are of\n\nwriting without having to refer consistently to the notes  \n\nright\n You want your plan to be as detailed as possible\n the pre-writing stage\n\nof your essay is the most important stage\n If you've done the reading and you've done the planning then the\n\nwriting of the essay becomes easy task but if you haven't done the research\n\nand you haven't done serious planning then writing is going to be difficult\n\nright and that is what we're working towards<,>\n Right because by the time you get to the exam stage we would expect\n\nyou to be able to go into this exam take a topic plan it very quickly that is\n\nwhy we've asked to do three plans mainly for practice<,>\n\nright so that you can plan quickly begin your essay write your essay<,>

final exam\n\n<$A>  One essay two hours but you're expected to plan you're\n\nexpected to write and leave at least fifteen minutes at the end for proof\n\nreading   because you have to remember there are two errors that\n\nI have observed that many students are failing in and it is in mechanics\n\nstroke grammar and uhm style style of writing\n students are still making spelling errors\n\npunctuation errors subject verb agreement tense uhm improper use    of uhm prepositions comma splice uhm errors et cetera\n These are errors that proof reading very often would help to\n\ncorrect right so you need to leave time at the end but I think you need to go\n\nback over this first part  <-> of the of the</- > uhm<,>  of\n\nthe outline<,> because you don't want to talk so much\n\nabout   terrorism you want to\n No\n right\n Get on to the topic\n\n five minutes late for my class but I'll\n\n<unclear> two-words</unclear> not\n So when are you writing\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>

presenting on uh powerless communication strategies the Japanese\n\n market\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C> \n\n\n<$B> \n Okay\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Now the reason for this paper is based on the assumptions made\n\nabout Japanese business men<,> in terms of their social positions to Western\n\nbusiness men<,>\n And uh these assumptions are that Japanese men are socially\n\ninferior to Western men because of the similarities in the way they speak the\n\nsimilarities between the Japanese and the Western women<,> uh<,,>\n speech patterns of\n\nJapanese men is that they tend to use what the Western men consider a\n\npowerless language in that uh they are very cooperative\n When talking they will fall silent when another person is speaking\n They\'re very attentive\n you\n\ntalk<,>\n Right they\'re encouraging you\n now and, in when Western men\n\nand Japanese business men sit down to negotiate<,> the cultural differences\n\ncome up very sharply and it leads to a lot of uhm problems\n Now one of the main problems is what power means in Western society\n\nversus Japanese society<,>\n nineteen\n\neighty three says that power is the possibility of imposing one\'s will upon\n\nothers\n This is the Western definition\n The Webster dictionary says it is the possession of sway or\n\ncontrolling influence over others\n when you look at the fact that Western society is\n\negocentric you can see how being able to get your opinions across making\n\nother persons accept them and quiet when you\'re talking is truly like uhm a\n\nbit of power\n\n\nin Western society the men are generally in a more dominant position\n\nthan the women<,>\n they\'re the\n\nones who dominate the conversations\n They\'re the ones who choose the topics the women usually fall all\n\nsilent when they\'re interrupted and allow the men to speak,\n And that\'s the same thing that the Japanese men do\n the uhm oh and here it is\n In Western society the women tend to have the lower social\n\npositions in society than the men\n So they tend to be more cooperative this is pretty much how they\'re\n\ntrained\n Alright\n If someone in a higher position is talking be cooperative be\n\nsubmissive\n\n<$C> \n\n<$D> That\'s the woman\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$D> \n\n<$B> \n\nstereotypically because uhm as uhm<,> time went on and women became\n\n <- >   more   dominant in social\n\npositions they realised that it

interrupt\n\njust like the men\n Okay\n Now in Japan Japan is a sociocentric society\n therefore\n\nif you\'re depending on a group you want to maintain harmony\n So you are going to try and, help the other if someone is\n\nspeaking you are not going to butt in because that\'s really rude\n You want the person to bring across their ideas because they think\n\nit will help the group and it is actually uhm the ability to   uhm do\n\nthis is considered mature and that is really that\'s a positive thing not\n\na negative thing in   Japan\n\n<$E> \n\n<$E> \n\n<$E> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$C>  Negative in the Western society\n\n<$B>  It would be negative in the Western society where it\'s\n\negocentric\n It\'s all about me\n\n So that\'s it\n\n okay uhm some of the traits\n\nthat praised by the Japanese are empathy receptiveness being open-hearted\n\nbeing sensitive to  needs\n\n\nwhich is why it is considered negative and that is why when the Western men\n\nmeet these Japanese men they have this miscommunication<,>\n you have the feminine versus masculine\n\n Uhm being masculine doesn\'t mean that you are male because you can\n\nbe a submissive male and you can be a dominant female\n in conclusion it is basically the cultural differences which\n\nhave led to these miscommunication is not that Japanese men are socially\n\ninferior to Western men\n But based on their own culture\n They are being polite and mature and gracious to allow the Western\n\nmen to say what they want to say and not interrupt\n If the Western men had interrupted okay that person needs to speak\n I\'ll shut up and allow him to speak\n I don\'t know I\'ll give you the floor\n And the Western men seeing that when it happens in their culture\n\nit\'s a sign of weakness  that what can you and wanna talk now\n society is\n\ninferior to ours\n That\'s it\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  Alright\n Thank you\n Now there\'re a few things there\n\n\n<$D>   , So in other words   \n\nthe men and the women<,> have that submissive way \n\n<$C> \n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$D> \n Yeah\n\n<$B> \n\n  the men which is one   document  I\'ve\n\nhad just the   business men because we know that uhm\n\nJapan<,> is a hierarchy\n So I wanted to know if there was a business woman a Japanese\n\nbusiness woman or even now Western business woman in these dialogue\n What would happen\n\n<$A> \n\n<$D> \n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$E>  earlier experiences that\n\nthe Japanese women tend to be   submissive to their men too and\n\nthey\'re very respectful and   only have to have those little<,>\n\nthings in order to address and so on but\n\n<$C> \n\n<$D> \n\n\n\n<$B>  If they\'re sociocentric because how they deal with it is like\n\nthey deal with it as one big pole Western society versus Eastern society\n\n<$A>  you\n\nread\n\n Mhm\n\n<$B>  particular\n\npaper<,>\n How would they now speak in the groups where because the Eastern\n\nsystem so community is far more rigid than the Western<,>\n Western women will probably have a easier time getting to\n\ninterrupt the men where up uhm compared to the Japanese women so it would be\n\nreally interesting to see if four-way dialogue with the Japanese women\n\nJapanese men versus Western women Western men\n\n<$A> \n\n  what you\'re focussing  \n\n   on at the moment is yeah now one or two questions\n Uhm what were the conclusions you said that Wetzel arrived at\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  this\n\ncultural   miscommunication<,> not that uhm the Eastern\n\nsociety is inferior<,> because as far as they\'re concerned they\n\nwere being mature  ,  and gracious not<,> inferior\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nWestern   business men thought they were inferior because\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n Yes because of the speaking the use of powerless language\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Alright\n notice\n\nthat she started off with stereotypes of uhm Western   women and\n\nmen   uhm  in interaction and you <unclear>\n\nwords</unclear> who are saying what<,,> \n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  What she saying\n\n\n<$A> \n\nabout the<,>\n when she was telling us what Wetzel had said about\n\nstereotypical<,> uhm   Western men and women and    you were interjecting and\n\nthen she said but remember this is a stereotype<,>\n\n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n\n<$C> \n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$D> I think I was asking her if<,> it\'s the men you remember  ,\n\nif the men    if the Japanese men because you\n\n have kind of have this submissive way<,> and I know the\n\nwoman have that   submissive way\n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  And now we have that\'s what I want to point to because you\n\nhave to remember that what you\'re looking at is<,> uhm a particular\n\ncontext<,> in which there are business   men and\n\njust the comparison and the discussion is about   business men\n\n , but we have to remember that  <- > Japan \n\nJapanese society is<,> structured patriarchally<,>\n will\n\nhave to be very   respectful to a man<,> so however uh\n\nrespectful a   Japanese man is in terms of    a Western man<,> we can assume\n\nthat when that Japanese man is<,>in his own\n own\n\n  uhm  context   with a Japanese\n\nwoman that they\'re\n\n And in fact if you remember when we were talking about uh\n\nhonourifics<,> and Japan   I did say to you\n\nthat this use of "  san"   by\n\nwomen<,>  back to show respect\n Yes women to men\n\n\nsan" to a man who is<,> uh superior to them in terms of\n\nfor example his job or in terms of his social status\n Yes\n\n\nwome  women are the only people\n\nwho show respect it is that there\'s a whole set of respect that is shown uh\n\ndepending on where you are in the social ladder  \n\nuhm  with respect to the addressee<,> or the other participant in\n\nyour interaction,\n\n\nwere talking about<,> the<,> I\'m not sure if you\'re saying that Wetzel\n\nsuggests that being respectful as a Japanese man is what is considered\n\ninferior by   an American\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  Business men\n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\nseveral-words</unclear>\n\n<$C>  Mhm\n Mhm\n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  man\n\nyes\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  Hmm\n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  show\n\nrespect <unclear> words</unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\nthat\'s what caused it because Japanese men uhm in their social context\n\nyou are they believe in harmony as a group<,>\n if they\'re in dialogue\n As a group you are supposed to allow the other person give them\n\nleeway you\'re not supposed to be interrupting pushing your thought in\n\nhugging the floor at  <- >   per se\n So when you\'re faced with the Western society where that happens\n\nand that is how you   establish dominance  \n\nbecause<,> then you say oh they are inferior to us because well they are\n\ngiving us the  prize so easy to take it away from them and keep it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$D> \n\n\n<$D> \n\n\n<$A>  And what does that tell you about the Western man in that\n\nsituation and his idea about inferiority\n\n<$B>  In well because uhm their Western society is not so rigid\n\nbecause in Japan you already know your social role you know who\'s above you\n\nwho\'s below you\nabove you speaking by all\n\nmeans be quiet\n In Western society however is there a sort of guessing game\n maybe I am higher than that person I\'m going to try and uh\n\nif I can control the floor<,> then I can establish my dominance\n the Western man now he has to establish his position usually\n\nimmediately<,> no one knows really that I am below that person\n\n<$A>  this in you\'re talking about uhm\n\nbusiness\n Yes go ahead\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D>  What I don\'t understand is this thing here\n\n\ndo you think they\'re thinking about  , whether I am above\n\nthat person or    if you know a person \n\n  they don\'t generally think about \n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  No you don\'t believe subconsciously but the way our society\n\nis set up the person who controls the floor is automatically seen as the\n\ndominant person whether or not they are sometimes in terms of social\n\nroles<,,>\n\n<$A> \n\nbusiness people in<,> uh in sort of consultative position<,>\n So the question is does Wetzel suggest that what is dominant in\n\nthe Western business man\'s mind is not the collaboration and consultation\n\nthat he is doing with Japanese but his assessment of the Japanese person in\n\nrelation to him as inferior\n\n<$B>', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '3961ded2-5e94-4503-a64a-a06b12990b2c', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:52.226957+00:00',

might have to enter it from the\n\nbeginning yes<,>\n\n you\n\nwant me to enter the problem from the beginning\n\n<$students> \n\n<$A>  I do not have the formulations so you're gonna read

Point five zero\n\n<$students>  And point two\n\n<$A>  Point two\n\n<$D>  Yeah\n\n<$A> \n\ni  that gotta be the changing cell\n colour\n\ncode it we could leave it at that<,>\n And we say we could put

us\n\nthat that's changing cells<,>\n\n What were the constraints\n First one\n\n<$D>  Zero point two five\n\n<$A>  okay\n\nso we enter the coefficient of the constraint<,> so point two five<,>\n What was the other one\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$A>  what is the other\n\n<$students>  One\n\n<$A> \n\n\na column<,> blank<,> but then we are going to\n We don't have to put this either but then we want to when we're\n\nlook at the thing we know what we're talking about\n So want to make sure that when we look at it we see as formulated\n So we gonna put the sense of the constraint but a sense can be\n\nequal less than equal to or greater than equal to\n Fair enough\n What was the sense\n\n<$students>  Greater than or equal\n\n<$A> \n we don't have\n\nto do that either but    on the right\n\nhand side of this one we'll do what\n\n<$C>  Three\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  We don't have to do it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n It's just a graph\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  point two five\n\n<$D>  Three\n\n<$A>  be

\n\n<$students> \n\n<$A>  One fifty\n\n<$B> \n\n<$students>  Four hundred\n\n<$A>  Four hundred\n\n<$students>  Fifty\n\n<$A> \n\n<$students> \n\n<$A>  And that'd be less than equal to

all\n\nthe less than or equal    to together and the\n\ngreater than or equal together\n When you're entering that as constraint in solver you can enter\n\nthem as en bloc rather than individual okay<,>\n What's the other constraint\n\n<$B>  Zero ten\n\n<$A>  yes\n\n<$B>  Alright\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  Ten\n\n<$A> \n\nlet's  let's put zero for completeness in<,> ten\n\n<$B>  One\n\n<$A>  One\n\n<$B> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$A>  the\n\n  what was this one\n\n<$B>  Point two\n\n<$D>  Point two\n\n<$A>  Point two\n\n<$B>  Negative point zero seven five\n\n<$A>  Say it again\n\n<$B>  Negative point

we call the target cell\n Again we could put the target cell anywhere because I put up there\n\nlast time does not put it here just to   \n\nshow    you that    you can\n You can put anywhere okay\n\n<$D> \n negative\n\nconstraints    was it was <unclear> word(s)</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  We don't have to enter them\n\nexplicitly\n\n<$A>  no\n\nnegative constraint explicitly because there is a fascinating in \n\nsolver that will allow us to define   right  to\n\ndesignate them as being connected<,>\n So let's put the target cell here so we say target cell\n\n\n\n  that's the

times\n\nthis plus this times that plus this times that<,> but then we said there is\n\nthis neat little function in Excel\n\n then we separate that first\n\nargument with a comma into the second

solve it<,>\n a set of\n\nformulas here<,> where we call the right hand side of a constraint<,>\n\n<$D>  left\n\n<$A> \n that formula again it will be the changing cells this\n\nchanging cell times this that times that and this times that okay\n Then it also gonna be this times this to get here\n\n\n whom part this is<,>\n\n\n we are going to fix that<,> okay<,>    all of us know the reason for

want so\n\nthat's fine come from here to here and from here to here so that's fine\nWe don't want that\n\nbecause it gonna be this<,> changing cell multiplied by this row this\n\nchanging cell multiplied by this row and so on\n\n and\n\nwe press F four\n key press F\n\nfour<,> and we have an absolute reference  recording\n\n\n Now numbers are here because I have a number here clear enough\n\n<$D>  Mhm\n\n<$A> \n\n\n when you reach this point you save\n\nthe file<,> okay\n especially those who just let it\n\nprocess enter the thing and then they go to solver and something happens hung\n\nup and they have to start over\n\n\n and we\n\nclick on solver<,>\n Now when we click on solver we are gonna get this pop down thing\n\nokay\n\n\ncomp when you click on that you will get an

you say okay\n Now you might still get an error saying that you need to insert\n\nthe C D<,>\n Now it needs one of two things\n\n\n<$C>  We've got our pirate copies\n\n<$A>  there are\n\noptions I'm not finished with my options\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm coming, okay   \n\nand\n\n\ngive  give the context of the class\n I did not\n\nsay a pirate I said either the one that you pirate\n I shouldn't say either

{'text': "<$A>  Okay we're gonna start the lecture now\n Today we are privileged to have Suzette Haughton who is one of our\n\nsterling students our starlets\n narcotics and international\n\nlaw\n You remember last week we started to talk about the Shiprider and we\n\nlooked at the basic provisions that the U S wanted as oppposed to what\n\nJamaica and Barbados wanted\n Suzette is gonna deal with these two major issues in today's\n\nlecture<,,>\n\n<$B>  Okay uhm good afternoon\n\n<$students>  Good afternoon\n\n<$B>  Alright uhm today as Miss Stone mentioned we'll be looking at\n\nthe political and legal issues involved in the Shiprider Agreement\n\n\nthe negotiation process and then I'll be looking at the results what\n\ncame out of the negotiation\n Okay there are two main political factors that influenced the\n\nsigning of the Shiprider Agreement<,>\n is that the Jamaican leadership could not afford\n\nto be de-certified by the United States<,> right<,,>\n Now de-certification is a process which is authorized by section\n\nfour ninety<,,> of the United States Foreign Assistance Act of nineteen\n\nsixty-one<,>\n\n<$C>  Four ninety\n\n<$B>  of the U S Foreign Assistance Act\n\nof nineteen sixty-one\n Now how this works is that the President would authorize uhm\n\nsomebody to develop a list of countries that are not cooperating with the\n\nfight against illicit narco-trafficking\n And these countries would be de-certified meaning that they would\n\nnot be given any economic assistance from the United States until they have\n\nuhm changed    their operations moved towards\n\ncurbing or trying to curb illicit narco-trafficking right<,>\n\n\nmarijuana producing country<,> right and this is recorded in the uhm\n\nInternational Narcotic Strategy Reports over the years right\n It's a major marihuana producing country\n It's also a major transhipment country of cocaine in coming from\n\nColombia<,>\n As a matter of fact fifty to sixty metric tons of cocaine pass\n\nthrough the Caribbean waters annually<,>\n Now Jamaica's refusal to cooperate with the United States may\n\nresult in extensive condemnation by the other states within the international\n\ncommunity right which is why our Prime Minister uhm opted to sign the\n\nagreement that's one of the reason\n issue is\n\nJamaica is a sovereign state meaning that it's an independent country\n\nright<,,>\n\n<$D>  Uhm Jamaica\n\n<$B>  Is a sovereign state\n\n<$D>  Yes\n\n<$B>  It's an independent country\n\n<$D> \n\none-or-two-words</unclear>  <- > I mean  I mean\n\n<$B>  No I'm still dealing with the political aspect\n I mentioned the issue of de- certification I mentioned the issue of\n\ncondemnation by the international community    if\n\nJamaica didn't cooperate\n Now I'm talking about the issue that Jamaica is a sovereign entity\n\nis a sovereign state<,> yeah\n Understand that point it's independent\n didn't negotiate the\n\nShiprider Agreement then the Jamaican people might criticize the government\n\nfor its poor handling of uhm the negotiation concerning the Shiprider\n\nAgreement<,>\n Alright so those are the political factors\n We want to move on to the legal factors now\n September\n\neight  on September eighteenth nineteen sixty-two Jamaica\n\njoined the United Nations right<,>\n\n\nit is  it has become a state party to  <- > this \n\nthis charter alright\n And as such it is bound by the rules and obligations stipulated in\n\nthe charter\n How is this important to us and the Shiprider Agreement\n states that the purposes of\n\nthe United Nation<,,> are to achieve and I'm quoting now \n\ninternational cooperation<,> in solving international problem<,> of social\n\neconomic cultural and humanitarian character<,,>\n I'll just repeat that\n Article one chapter three of the United Nation Charter states that\n\n the purposes of the U N is to achieve international cooperation in\n\nsolving international problem of social economic cultural or humanitarian\n\ncharacter<,>\n Now the drug problem can be seen as an international problem that\n\nhas implication social implication and economic implication for countries\n\nalright okay\n Non-cooperation in solving the drug problem on Jamaica's part could\n\nbe seen as a refusal to assist in curbing<,,> the drug problem which in\n\neffect<,> could be seen as a violation of one of the fundamental purpose of\n\nthe United Nations<,,>\n Alright hm\n\n<$D> \n\n<$B>  We'll have a discussion afterwards okay\n Alright the second thing that you need to note is that the United\n\nuhm as a part of the United Nations<,> countries sign U N  <- > general\n\n uhm  general declarations\n One such is the general assembly declaration on principles of\n\ninternational law<,> concerning friendly relations<,> and cooperation among\n\nstates and this was signed in uhm nineteen seventy<,>\n of the United\n\nNations\n\n<$E>  please\n\n<$B>  member remember I\n\nsaid\n\n<$students> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  U N general\n\n<$F>  Declaration\n\n<$B>  concerning\n\nfriendly relations<,,> and cooperation among states<,,> and that was signed\n\nin nineteen seventy\n you would all know that the U N general declarations are\n\nnot<,> binding\n However they reflect pronouncements made by states alright\n Now this nineteen seventy U N general declaration stipulates that\n\nstates have a duty to cooperate with one another<,,> in order to maintain\n\npeace<,> security and economic stability<,,>\n Now it was felt that Caribbean illicit drug trafficking would\n\nreduce the associated security and stability ills for example drug related\n\ncrimes and corruption<,,>\n Okay Jamaica has also ratified three U N conventions relating to\n\nthe eradication of narcotic trafficking or narco-trafficking\n single convention\n\n<,,> and its nineteen seventy-two protocol\n Protocol are a treaty or a convention\n on\n\npsychotropic substances<,>\n\n<$?> \n\n<$B>  Psychotropic substances and the third one is the nineteen\n\neighty-eight Vienna Convention<,>\n Now all those three conventions that Jamaica ratified set a\n\nprecedent by which Jamaica cooperated in illicit<,> drug eradication\n\nefforts<,,>\n And as you can see it was evidence in Jamaica's state practice from\n\nas early as the nineteen sixties<,>\n\n<$G> \n\n<$B>  Mhm\n\n<$G>  Was it signed or ratified\n\n<$B>  What\n\n<$G>  Was it signed or ratified\n\n<$B>  Signed\n\n<$G>  Signed\n\n<$B> \n Jamaica customary practice is to cooperate with\n\ncounter drug initiatives<,> and those initiatives are spearheaded by the\n\nUnited States of course<,,>\n As such many bilateral treaties on counter drug agreements were\n\nsigned between Jamaica and the United States prior to the Shiprider\n\nAgreement<,,>\n which\n\nwas amended annually in nineteen eighty-eight<,> then you have the neutral\n\nlegal assistance treaty on drug related matters<,,>\n\n<$H>  Neutral what\n\n<$B>  Uh\n\n<$H>  Neutral what\n\n<$D> \n\n<$H>  the second\n\n<$B> \n Then by nineteen ninety-two you had the extradition treaty which of\n\ncourse was also signed between Jamaica and the U S<,> and nineteen ninety-six\n\nyou have the letter of agreement\n\n<$H> \n\n<$B> \n\n\nShiprider Agreement because they felt or the Jamaican leadership felt\n\nthat it was obligatory in adhering to the United Nations Charter itself and\n\nto the various    conventions that\n\nemerged out of    the United Nations especially the\n\nnineteen eighty-eight Vienna Convention<,,>\n article\n\nten three<,,> required states to conclude bilateral agreements<,,> in their\n\ncooperative efforts to address various aspects<,> of illicit traffic in\n\nnarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances right and later on when we get to\n\nthe uhm where they're actually doing the negotiations you will see that the U\n\nS will make reference that the Shiprider Agreement came out of this nineteen\n\neighty- eight Vienna Convention specifically article ten three\n\n<$?> \n\n<$B>  Mh\n\n<$?> \n\n<$B>  we get to the\n\nactual\n\n<$?> \n\n<$B>  It required states to conclude bilateral agreements in their\n\ncooperative efforts to fight against illicit   \n\ndrug trafficking<,> right<,,>\n the Jamaica U S uhm proposed Shiprider\n\nAgreement<,> Now bearing in mind all that I have\n\nsaid before about the legal and political uhm factors now   uhm\n\n on February twelve nineteen ninety-six<,> the United States\n\napproached the Jamaican officials with a model agreement what they referred\n\nto as a draft Shiprider Agreement<,> and they submitted this draft to\n\nJamaican officials<,> for their ratification\n Now the Jamaican officials looked at the draft assessed it and\n\ndecided no they didn't really agree with some of the articles there so what\n\nthey're going to do is hammer out their own agreement and   uhm  submit it to the United States\n That they did and then they both agreed that what they need is uhm\n\ntwo delegations<,,> to conduct a negotiation\n Jamaican delegation was headed by Doctor Kenneth\n\nRattray who is a uhm solicitor-general<,> and then the U S delegation was\n\nheaded by J Ashley  Roche who was a legal advisor in the U S state\n\ndepartment<,,>\n Okay we want to look now at the differences between the two\n\nagreements the two proposed agreement\n first model draft that was\n\nsubmitted by the United States and then the draft that Jamaica submitted\n Okay first difference concerned the scope of the treaty's\n\napplication<,,>\n\n<$?> \n\n<$B> \n the Jamaican draft was too\n\nnarrow in scope<,> while the Jamaican delegation of course argued the\n\nopposite   uhm  that the U S draft was too\n\nwide or broad in scope<,> full stop\n to\n\nsearch vessels<,,> that were suspect of carrying illicit narcotics<,>\n This permission they wanted to come from the minister of national\n\nsecurity or any person designated by the minister<,,> and the permission they\n\nwanted to be done or to be granted on a case by case basis right<,,>\n This the Jamaican delegation argued that uhm it would help to\n\nrespect Jamaica's sovereignty and also it would lead to open communication\n\nbetween Jamaicans and the United States<,,>\n wanted to confer absolute\n\nauthority<,> on U S officials<,> to search vessels<,> as they wished<,>\n\nwithin<,> Jamaica's maritime waters<,> with or without a shiprider a Jamaican\n\nshiprider<,,>\n\n<$G> \n\n<$B>  Huh the last part\n\n<$G>  Uhu\n\n<$B>  Okay the U S delegation wanted Jamaica to confer absolute\n\nauthority<,> on them meaning that they wanted<,> Jamaica to grant them the\n\nright<,> to search vessels within Jamaican maritime waters<,,> without\n\npermission for one and whether or not any Jamaican shiprider was on board<,>\n when I was doing the Shiprider Agreement and I\n\nread    this statement I said to myself the United\n\nStates is very unreasonable but when I started doing my research for my\n\nthesis<,> I questioned it even more and then I realized that it wasn't really\n\nthat the United States was unreasonable\n They did the draft based on their domestic laws right and Jamaica\n\ndraft was based on Jamaica's domestic laws alright\n So it's okay it's legally correct for the United States to board\n\nsearch and seize a vessel and to hold    the\n\ntraffickers until law enforcement officials come but   uhm  it's not legally correct within Jamaica's domestic\n\nor municipal laws alright because for one thing only the Jamaica Constabulary\n\nForce and only the Jamaica Defence Force are empowered    those law enforcement personnel are empowered to\n\narrest under our constitution within our domestic laws okay\n So to confer a right light what the United States wanted would\n\nmean that we would have to amend our laws our Jamaica Constabulary Force and\n\nJ D F laws\n\n\n<$K> \n\n<$B>  Mhm\n\n<$K> \n\n  does the U S want to <unclear>\n\nwords</unclear>\n\n<$?> \n\n<$B>  territory\n\n<$K> \n\n<$B>  What they know different zones they have internal waters that\n\nwould be a good consent\n Then in our case you have archipelagic waters and then you have\n\nthe territories<,> right so they wanted to come right within our zone of\n\nsovereignty as far as the territorial waters\n another difference concern the issue difference\n\nbetween both draft proposals concern the issue of the interpretation of the\n\nnineteen eighty-two law of the sea convention", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': '<$A>  Morning\n Alright so uhm yesterday I mentioned that we would be doing\n\nsomething interesting today in that we would look at what happens when you\n\ntry to<,,> in general uh test    a  \n\nset of sentences for consistency\n we actually did\n\nthat<,> as if we would always be able to come up with an answer\n Right\n Remember\n I\'m giving you an argument asking is it valid or not\n\n\nseveral-words</unclear> set of premises<,> and then look to see if you can\n\n obtain a contrary to my quote in the Tree Method<,>\n expecting\n\nthat after<,> shifting around the symbols and doing some stuff you would\n\nactually end up with an answer at the end of the day and generally speaking\n\nyou kind of do but not by following a particular algorithm right\n itself\n\nis an algorithm<,> but what you do after a while is the way this  tree\n\nis reflecting on your <unclear> word</unclear>\n said they were trying to\n\nconstruct the counter-example<,> right\n Okay\n is\n\nterm  is in terms of what set of instructions do you need to\n\ngive to a Turing machine to make it eventually decide  your algorithm\n\nright\n That\'s what we mean by " decidable"\n So the tree roots themselves of perfect Turing machine uh\n\ninstructions but in order for you to actually use that as an algorithm you\n\nhave to have a way of saying alright you\'ve gone far enough now try\n\nconstructing a counter-example and that\'s the part where   uh\n\n it\'s no longer what we would call an algorithm right\n So it turns out that actually there is no such algorithm because\n\nit\'s gonna be undecidable and now we\'re gonna  even take\n\n\nthat\n Right\n The uhm as weird as it sounds it\'s actually not that strange but\n\nit\'s the  quantity the construction\n You\'ll see that oh it\'s not really a big deal\n\n\n\nwrote there\n So you generally want to know given M and W you want to know if M\n\naccepts W\n reducing a\n\nT M\n What we would presume is suppose you had a method for testing the\n\nconsistency right\n So suppose you had a decider that could tell you yes or no if this\n\nset of sentences    if it were consistent<,>\n What we want to show is that you can take an M and a W and convert\n\nit to a set of logic sentences such that if they were consistent then M will\n\naccept W\n You understand what I\'m saying\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  Yeah\n\n<$A> No\n Yes\n\n<$C> \n\n<$D>  So far\n\n<$A>  Alright\n\n\nwhat  what we\'re gonna try and try to<,>\n\nright\n a pair M and W you want to be able to\n\nuhm produce<,> a set of<,,> sentences in logic<,,> that are consistent<,,> if\n\nand only if M accept W<,>\n Right\n\n\n you\'re going to think oh actually that\'s not a big deal\n I hope so anyway\n Alright\n What we need for M to accept W\n What you actually have is that you\'d say well the machine starts\n\nwith the initial configuration right<,> and then it actually proceeds from\n\nthe initial configuration through a sequence of configurations until it\n\nactually gets to some accepting configuration\n don\'t\n\nwe<,>\n Okay\n Suppose I were to give you a description of a machine namely the\n\nstate diagram with all the transitions everything marked out on it\n\n\nspeci  so you\'re given only W and the M is given as you\n\nknow the machine\n\n\nwords</unclear>\n\n\n<$E> \n\n<$F> \n\n<$A> \n You just wrote it right\n\n\n it accepts it\n it\'s not an\n\nalgorithm in the sense that we have been using because it may not\n\nhalt\n But the point is the machine itself encodes a bunch of roots and\n\nthose roots tell you how you can get from one configuration legally to the\n\nnext one\n So then if you can encode that in logic then you could actually end\n\nup with a bunch of sentences in logic that describe what the machine does and\n\nthen you need one sentence to say that you actually have an initial\n\nconfiguration which is gonna be composed of the initial start state of W\n Right\n And then what other sentence do I need\n\nfinally\n\n\n Okay\n So if I can put all those sentences together then if you could test\n\nfor consistency then you tell me that the machine  halted\n it\n\n\nsentences and    this is one sentence but this one  is gonna\n\nbe main sentences so <unclear>\n\nword(s)-due-to-noise-in-background</unclear> the description of the<,> finite\n\nstate controller<,,>    of M\n\n Right\n\n So everybody is alright with that\n\n<$F> \n\n<$D>  No\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$D>  Sir\n\n<$A> Yeah\n\n<$D>  two sentence I accept the\n\nconfiguration in three right\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$D>  decide for M W\n\n<$A>  No no no no alright\n Here we go\n\n I\'m gonna build you a bunch of sentences that basically say one\n\nyou\'d have the initial configuration instantiated so that you\'ll have two we\n\nwill reach some accepting state and then a collection of sentences that\n\ndescribe what configuration can legally follow from another\n Okay\n So this one is gonna actually be a family of conditionals\n implies this\n\nother one\n Okay\n\n\n  symbol  of all sentences\n So what we\'re doing is you have a collection of these sentences\n\nbut the only way they\'re actually consistent is if in fact they would have\n\nmodelled the machine operating on W and reaching an accepting state\n\n So that if you had a decider for this collection then you\'d say\n\nyou have a decider    for a T M\n Right\n the idea\n a small\n\nvocabulary<,>\n But the idea is very simple\n Right\n too\n\nmuch\n Right what we gonna need to find about four\n\nfunctions which we\'ll use in our logic sentences\n Uhm generally speaking what are the components of a\n\nconfiguration\n\n<$A>  the constants and\n\nt\n current states\n so in terms of\n\nwhere we were close we actually also included the symbol and the head of\n\nreading remember<,,><,>\n\n Alright\n And u is from sigma star q is from the set of states\n\n Yeah v is from sigma star too and a was our symbol underneath the\n\nhead right\n Okay\n except that\n\nwe\'re going to sorry treat them as a tuple so we\'re gonna\n\ntreat  them as a four tuple that describes a particular configuration\n\nright\n And what we\'re gonna say is we\'re gonna create the predicate\n\npredicate we have four places and let\'s call it R So we write down the sentence R u q a v to mean\n\nconfiguration u q a v is reached<,>\n Okay\n Everybody alright\n So R is your big predicate but it\'s just a way of saying how we\n\nget to that configuration\n vocabulary is talking\n\nbut what I need to create is the ability to modify new strings\n Right\n So you see why we need to modify the strings right because if I\n\nmove the head left what\'s supposed to\n\nhappen<,>\n\n<$F> \n\n<$A>  If you move the head left and then\n\nyou\n\n\nthe position I\'m reading is going to be the last symbol of u when I\n\nmove left\n So whatever that symbol is needs to now appear up here when I\n\nwrite up    the configuration\n And I need to say well what have I modified a to\n\n So I need some functions I can extract out the last symbol the\n\nfirst symbol to prepend something to a string and to append something to a\n\nstring\n\n\n try to find the\n\nsimplest one\n let\'s call it\n\nattach<,,>\n so I have a function of two parts\n Implicitly you know that uhm a is your symbol from your alphabet\n\nand w    is something else which generally speaking\n\nyou  want to think of it as some string\n Uhm but what we\'re gonna do is just say okay well attach is this\n\nup here a w okay<,,>\n Alright uhm what else do I need\n end\n writes-on-the-\n\nblackboardAnd now\n can tell me\n\nhow to define this\n before I can do that legal uh\n\nalright I guess I get I<,,>  before I can do that I have to\n\ntell you how we\'re gonna select our pieces right\n So I need a notation for that\n define it here\n\n Technically speaking as far as logic is concerned you\'d have to\n\ndefine it as another function but  <-> </- >  let us\n\nwork with it as if it\'s something built in because all we want is some way of\n\nselecting the pieces out of a tuple okay\n So I\'m gonna want to be able to given a pair now we get the first\n\nelement I want to just be able to    select\n\nout element zero to this pair and you know to get the rest of it down to\n\nselect out the second part\n Okay\n notation uhm\n down arrow and\n\nthen I put in a zero and I\'m talking about the first part of the pair\n\nokay<,,>\n And this is\n Right\n\n\n<$A>  Alright\n a matter of\n\nnotation\n\n\n to mean that I want to extract out the first part of the pair and\n\ndown arrow one to mean that the second piece of the pair\n Okay\n\n\n<$G>  Got a question there\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$G>  string\n\n<$A>  A is a symbol from the alphabet so it\'s one character\n\n<$G> \n One character\n Thank you\n\n<$A>  I mean that\'s what you want to think about it\n\n\nstring but if you think about building up a string from scratch you see that\n\nit\'s actually    a bunch of nested\n\npairs<,> okay\n So think of W as being this bunch of nested pairs and then I want\n\nto actually paste on an W at the end of it', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

first one as our friend here said she said she going to\n\nget a overview of you know<,> what is really happening at the\n\nschools\n You go in to the principal right and you let her know just like\n\nour friend here brought his letter you know to establish himself as a\n\nresearcher\n Of course you need to have your letter you carry it to the\n\nprincipal of the school to know so that you've been sent from the minister of\n\neducation right\n Of course because you need to have a standard letter\n introduce\n\nhimself\n\n\nword(s)</unclear>  here you can just pass it around\n\n Right\n Yeah you need to have one of those let them know that you'll be\n\nthere to observe\n You can ask her if it's possible\n She will permit you to see the attendance records right\n You know over all so you can pick out those persons out the list\n\n<unclear> word(s)</unclear> they're going to be the first to indicate that\n\nthose who miss school five times or more for the month\n Right\n\n<$?> \n\n<$?> \n\n<$D> , cos I mean\n\nyou're not dealing with a particular grade you're dealing with the whole\n\nschool\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  No yeah because what we got here is that delinquency amongst\n\nstudents at Mona High   so they didn't give us any  specifics\n so we're goin through everything here right\n Good\n Now we're going through that probably now is where qualitative\n\nmethods uhm come in\n You can go to the teachers at the various forms or coordinators of\n\nthe various forms and ask them which class or which students are the most\n\nrowdiest set of students you know those students that give trouble on average\n\nat school right\n That's a good start also right\n\n\nword(s)</unclear> never show up at school always come late always look untidy\n\nnot doing their schoolwork always bullying the students right\n So you have some indicators of persons\n Also please don't let your biases get in the way right\n going\n\nto mind no matter what you do believe him just  turn out to help\n\nsomebody <unclear> word(s)</unclear> chat too much in class\n right\n as a researcher let's try and put our\n\nemotions aside right\n That's very hard because we're human beings\n\n<$students> \n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  right but we have to try and\n\nset them aside right\n Everybody okay with that\n\n<$?>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  So how do you proceed from here\n Come on remember we're all going to research together so all you\n\nneed to get involved\n\n<$B>  students that you\n\nknow in trouble and all of that you could uhm like you said we could ask the\n\nteacher to point them out or whatever<,> you could go further as to\n\nyou know check what sort of background they're coming from so you'll sort of\n\nknow what\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  And how would you proceed to get all that information\n\n<$B> \n\nword(s)</unclear>\n\n<$?> \n\n<$C>  Interview\n\n<$A> \n We're now using qualitative not quantitative techniques\n\n\ninterviews right<,>\n\n\n  a little booklet or whatever it is with some\n\nquestions <unclear> word(s)</unclear> most questions you kind of get   you know  some background information type of homes they\n\ncome from you know single parent or both parents\n Remember you must have some theory guiding your research also\n\nright right<,>\n also whatever area they live in\n\nright they come from upscale neighbourhood they come from ghetto cool\n You can ask them how many siblings you know how many brothers and\n\nsisters live at home with them you know if it's at all possible to ask them\n\nwhat type of you know jobs their parents some of the times you know parents\n\nare not at home like probably a single parent is working two jobs so you know\n\nthey're not really at home to supervise\n So all of that you know is running through your head so given all\n\nof those different scenarios you have to make sure that your questions fit\n Right\n Anything else\n Let's continue remember what we're trying to do, get

ya I\'ve got complaints\n\nthat Trinidad is like a little graveyard for languages\n talks about first of\n\nall<,> uhm the demographic factor\n She says that before eighteen o seven that\'s a\n Right\n eighteen hundred before\n\nthe end of the slave trade there were a few Yoruba speakers but the real\n\ninfluence of Yoruba speakers was in eighteen forty-one to sixty-seven\n However in eighteen sixty-one the percentage of Yoruba speakers\n\nto African speakers that were already using a creole was seven point one\n\npercent\n\n\nus  to us yesterday that absolute figures are sometime\n\nimportant I\'ll write it down and the ratio was eighty-four thousand four\n\nhundred and thirty-eight creole speaking slaves already<,>\n\nversus only six thousand and twenty-five Yoruba speakers\n\n<$E> \n\n<$E> \n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$D>  Uhm eighteen sixty-one\n slaves ex- slaves\n\nrather    this population  tends a lot of\n\nthing in eighteen sixty-one\n\n\n<- > creole Africans  creole speaking African people versus\n\nonly six thousand twenty-five Yoruba speakers\n By eighteen sixty-five uhm African indentureship was phased out\n\nso there was no new Yoruba speakers coming into Trinidad<,> at\n\nall\n final factor\n\nwhich I think is like you know    the classical\n\nstage in a language death is that Yoruba speakers now had to deal with the\n\nissue of usefulness you know whether this language was useful or not uh\n They had to integrate themself into a community now because\n\nreferring what <unclear> name</unclear>\'s article she said that the minimal\n\nrequirement for minority language to survive is that the people have to\n\nremain isolated and virtually cut off from the rest of society and that could\n\njust not do    in post- emancipation Trinidad\n\n\nchurch and education and everything    they just\n\nhad to adopt the uh creole\n uhm Yorubans\n\nwhether that\'s really Yorubans uhm    they\'re the type of people that uhm went\n\nto extreme measures to preserve their language\n for example you have a Yoruba\n\nfamily the only one    let\'s say the grandfather is\n\nthe only speaker of Yoruba\n He would take the young one and raise the young one\n give him\n\nformal instruction on how use and speak Yoruba\n\n\nthat\'s very extreme but you know\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$D> \n It has just been reduced to you know uhm ritual religion and a\n\nfew words especially    in  <- > some \n\nsome    one uhm example Lewis gave us was uh\n\nuh a daughter warned her mother in a  sermon of the family supply of\n\nwater being contaminated by urine in the presence of visitors\n\n used a special term which I first\n\n remember up on this cryptolect and a cryptogram is like a little\n\npuzzle they have   <unclear> word</unclear> and length have some\n\npretty language<,>\n So that\'s basically what Yorubans administer a cryptolect\n It\'s you know just for religious purposes and you know anybody\n\nwant to\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n So if extreme isolation is the precondition for language survival\n\nthen why is it that all those languages survived in\n\nSurinam\n\n\nin Surinam has preserved his language\n\n<$D> \n They\'re not\n do they manage to\n\nsurvive\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$B> \n of\n\ncommunities do they have because I mean like    that education provided an impetus\n Now in the case of Surinam would education provide impetus for\n\npeople to shift to their Creole in Surinam\n\n\n<$C>  Because Dutch is what is taught\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$D>  Different lexicon\n\n<$Z> \n Different lexicon\n Exactly\n\n\n to Creole because it\'s a different lexicon\n\n<$C> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D>  very tricky\n\nlinguistic situation  <- > and  and   \n\nhow is it like that though\n\n\nstereotype there<,>    to this day\n surprised\n\n<$C> \n\n<$Z> \n So uhm isolation can be literal people can be physically isolated\n\nno road to their village etcetera   but can also be self-imposed\n Right\n said you can live in a big city and still be\n\nisolated isolate your community from other people\n\n<$C> \n\n<$E>  Alright\n Yeah\n\n\nwhy the  why uhm    the creole\n\nlanguages    were spoken in Surinam are still being\n\nmaintained I think for any reason\n\n<$Z> \n But isolation can also be imposed by uhm uhm a colonial\n\ngovernment\n\n<$E>  Mhm\n\n<$Z> \n Any idea how\n had been the Dutch\n\ngovernment of the day in Surinam and you wanted to ensure that your in common\n\ncontract labour did not really communicate and relate to the existing\n\npopulation of Surinam so that you could nicely control the population\n\n\n<$D>  Got some more\n\n<$Z> \n\n Wow\n\n<$E>  you tell\n\nthem where to live<,>\n\n\nisolated<,> uhm then\n Dododododoo\n already have control\n\nover their work situation<,> uhm<,>\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$D>  thing\n\n<$Z> \n And what about\n what is\n\nit<,>\n Remember the contexts in which languages do survive\n For what kinds of contexts again\n\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\nreligious uhm\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n surviving while Hindi rather surviving for what purpose\n\n<$D> \n\nreligious reasons\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n So as a government what would you do\n\n\n<$D>  Right\n Okay\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$E>  Oh\n So then they feel like uhm their languages are worth something so\n\nthey\'ll keep speaking it\n\n\n<$D>  might be the\n\nreligion\n\n<$Z> \n So you see how different that is from the treatment that the\n\nAfricans got<,>\n Right\n Okay so instead of supporting the use of the language and\n\nsupporting the survival of religion and other cultural\n\ncustoms<,> the Africans got the bad deal<,>\n\n\n<$E> \n\n<$G> \n\n<$D>  a\n\nstatementthat\n was a\n\nview by one of the Yoruba speakers I  sailed with the language so let\n\nme bury with it    which means you know I\n\nwas bought as a slave in this language so let me go  bury it and I\n\nthink that is an extreme isolation without the physical<,>\n\nright<,> isolation  as you pointed\n\nout to us\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n the man says also\n\nsuggests that the treatment they got was not better than\n\nslaves<,> even though they were so- called voluntary men \n\n,  on contract\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$Z> \n Alright\n Uhm\n What I want from you next week is I want you to actually write up\n\na list of what reading you have done both compulsory and non-compulsory for\n\nvarious topics and hand in that list\n So I want some idea of you know how well you\'re doing in that\n\nrespect<,,>\n And you might want to remind me next week that we need to talk\n\nabout the possibility of the Guyana trip\n\n\n<$A>  On a credit system\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  On a credit basis\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  On a credit basis\n\n<$Z> \n Well uhm uh\n\n\n<$A>  I can go and pay afterwards and come back\n\n<$E>  Yeah\n\n<$Z> \n Oh on that basis\n\n\n<$G>  did that\n\n  argument on the whole\n\n<$Z> \nstudents-leaving-\n\nclassroom\n\n\n\n<$A>  So as Alleyne reports they\'re used in fixed and stylised\n\nexpressions but they have no creativity<,,>\n And he also goes on to say because he collected some data from\n\nsome of the Maroon communities older people<,> particularly if they\'re over\n\nfifty or so when they\'re in the waters and that\'s particularly rum what they\n\nend up doing is competing with each other to see who can produce as many of\n\nthese uhm  tree or <unclear> word</unclear> phrases as possible\n varieties are\n\nmore and more uhm like wider Accompong or wider St Thomas or wider Mo Bay\n discussion\n\nof it though in the reading list  Roots of Jamaican culture\n\nokay yes so and particularly around pages page a hundred and twenty-seven\n\naround in that section of the book he discusses Maroon language in\n\nJamaica<,,>\n\n Remember the issue in Surinam is that you have Dutch arriving\n\ninto a colony that has British settlement and that creates  \n\n the occasion for the    mass exodus\n\nfrom some of the plantations\n So in seventeen thirty-eight you have about six thousand Maroons\n\nthat\'s the estimate<,,>\n\n Contemporary estimates are that there are about twenty thousand\n\nSaramaccan about sixteen thousand Ndjuka<,,> and there\'s a small group of\n\nabout a thousand Matawai<,,>\n you all\n\nthe Saramaccan and the Ndjuka texts right<,,>\n Yes no\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  You got examples of Saramaccan and Ndjuka already didn\'t you\n\n<$C>  Yeah the beginning of\n\nit\n\n<$A>  Think\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  This is some twenty Saramaccan right and sixteen Ndjuka\n\n<$A>  Thousand\n\n<$D>  Yes it\'s twenty thousand and sixteen\n\n<$A> \n Most of the Saramacca fled between sixteen seventy-five and\n\nseventeen fifteen\n Many of them fled from Jewish owned plantations\n\n\n<$C>  sixteen what and\n\nwhat\n\n<$A> \n\n\nand the Matao originally come out of Emanuel  Machados plantation\n\nhence they have that clan name of Matao<,,>\n\n\nname</unclear> who originally came off of somebody\'s plantation named \n\nKadosso\n So they have these Portuguese uhm clan names which are derived\n\nlargely from the plantations that they escaped from<,>\n So the creole that they speak is English Portuguese lexicon also\n\nheavily influenced by Congo Twi Ewe and Fon<,,>\n And if you remember from the example of Saramaccan I gave you it\n\nis a very conservative Creole\n Uh Alleyne people like Alleyne suggest that it represents maybe\n\nthe oldest layer of Creoles in the Caribbean\n And the group is still very isolated\n There was a documentary on TV in fact about them a few years ago\n\nbecause there\'s a heavy interest in their use of herbal medicine\n And you do literally have to travel for days or over to get to\n\nwhere they are\n\n\n\nat  in about seventeen fifteen<,,>\n An they formed a separate group from the Saramaccan but they are\n\nalso  bush in grace that\'s the designation<,,>\n And when you compare the older these older Creoles Saramaccan\n\nNdjuka with Sranan<,> they have open syllables they have some vestiges of a\n\ntone system they have pre-nasalised stops\n Can I take this off\n\n<$E>  Yeah\n\n<$A> So you get forms\n\nlike this in Saramaccan<,,>\n\n Sranan on the contrary has closed syllables does not have the\n\ntone does not have the pre-nasalised stops\n And this is why the argument is that it represents a more\n\nconservative layer<,> of Creoles the  bushly called speech of\n\nSurinam<,,>\n For Ndjuka there was a writing system developed in nineteen ten\n\nbut it was never widely accepted<,,>\n But the preservation of Surinam uhm Maroon society is because of\n\ntheir isolation and therefore we\'re back to the issue that I raised of\n\nfocussed norms uhm and more frequent interaction within the group and    that tends to maintain language forms<,,>\n When we come to Barbados there\'s a report in Barbados that up to\n\nsixteen seventy<,> you had slave and servant maronage<,>\n\n After sixteen seventy though the island largely became a series\n\nof sugar estates and maronage does not become a feature   \n\nof Barbados\n And we\'ve already discussed the geography of Barbados and why\n\nthat would not be the case<,,>\n Okay uhm maronage and Indians because I want to discuss\n\nGarifuna<,,>\n Garifuna is the speech of people called Black Caribs largely in\n\nBelize to some extent there is a small community in St Vincent<,>\n\n two Spanish slave ships\n\nwere shipwrecked off the coast of St Vincent<,>\n\n\nword</unclear><,,>\n Sixteen seventy-five British slave ship shipwrecked off the coast\n\nas well\n\n It\'s a largely male group\n The next report that you have coming out of St Vincent is\n\nseventeen twenty-three that suggests that you have two groups of people Black\n\nand Red Caribs existing<,,>\n The implication of that therefore is that uhm Black Caribs must\n\nbe the off-spring of or the mixing with these   \n\nshipwrecked Africans as opposed to Red Caribs who do not have uh any\n\nsubstantial mixing with Africans<,,>\n Seventeen thirty there\'s report of conflict between Black and Red\n\nCarib which tells us what as well<,,>\n\n<$C>  Same thing Miss Golding\n\n<$D>  uh\n\n<$A>  If the groups are in contact it means there is some\n\nconstruct of a separate identity the groups are uhm distinct from each other\n\nand probably have little interaction with each other\n who at\n\nthe time were French\n and signed a\n\ntreaty with the Black Caribs<,,>\n And what you have is a series of alliances after that between\n\ncolonial power and different Carib group\n So initially the Red Caribs form an alliance with the French\n\ncolonial power against the Black Caribs\n In seventeen seventy-six the Black Caribs form an alliance with\n\nthe French against the British and recapture St Vincent<,,>\n\n\n<$C>  When was that again\n\n<$A> \n consequence of\n\nthat recapture is that in seventeen ninety-six the British decide to deal\n\nwith the problem once and for all and deport the Black Caribs from St Vincent\n\n In nineteen eighty-three population is estimated up\n\nto ninety thousand people who speak Garifuna in Belize\n\n<$D> Ninety thousand\n\n<$A> , But like elsewhere in the Caribbean there is also a\n\nhuge Garifuna speaking community apparently in New York as more and more\n\npeople migrate out of the Caribbean    for better\n\ncircumstances<,,>\n is described as a\n\nAmerindian language it\'s agglutinating in morphology\n is doing\n\nlinguistics\n\n<$E> \n\n<$A>  You want to explain to the class what agglutinating\n\nmorphology is\n\n<$E> \n uhm\n I don\'t I think it has something to do with well the morphology\n to existing\n\nwords\n I don\'t quite remember what\n\n ask her\n\n I don\'t remember a lot\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  So so\n Anybody\n\n<$F>  What\'s the term\n\n<$A>  Agglutinating what does it sound like\n\n\n<$F>  Something words coming together\n\n<$A>  How would that make it different from English\n English is not agglutinating\n\n<$F>  No but the other Creoles are more\n\n<$A>  Isolated right\n So what does agglutinating sound like though\n\n<$F>  I think so\n\n<$A> \n\n<$F> \n\n<$A>  No\n\n<$F>  Sounds like adding something\n\n<$A>  It doesn\'t sound like glue\n\n<$C>  Yes\n\n<$F>  Adding something\n\n<$A>  Adding what though I mean\n\n<$D>  words that would\n\n<unclear> words</unclear>\n\n<$C>  I think it\'s a French and English mix\n\n<$A>  No no no we\'re talking about the morphology\n In tutorial I\'ll give you some examples of\n\nGarifuna\n\n<$A>  Okay so let\'s isolating Jamaican\n\nisolating<,,>Isn\'t that what that\'s what it is\n\n<$F>  Yeah\n\n<$A> \n\n\nyou\'re adding on the grammatical elements to the verbal  end or\n Yes\n\n<$D>  Yeah\n\n<$G> \n\n<$A>  That\'s what agglutinating would be like if you\'re using the\n\nanalogy of    the same uhm form\n So you get these large if you like words made up of several\n\nmorphemes that are stocked together that    in\n\nessence give you a sense as opposed to individual grammatical or lexical\n\nitems\n But as I said in tutorial\n But huh everybody here has done most of you have done a forty A\n\n Huh\n with the with the\n\nwith this  with the excuse me you didn\'t have the tape with\n\nthe Garifuna and the person saying <unclear> word(s)</unclear>\n You didn\'t have any of that\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  That was Garifuna and you didn\'t have to translate it and\n\nsee how the words were stuck together\n So so why am I why am I talking up why am I being given faces\n\nlike it\'s like Greek\n So you didn\'t get that\n\n<$B>  No\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n So the language is Arawakan specifically\n It\'s agglutinating

Alright\n Okay\n What do you notice thus far of what you\'re doing\n You\'re the ones telling me that these are the first changes to\n\nmake\nstudents-\n\ntalking\n What aspect of the language are you

agree\n\n<$students> Yes\n\n<$A>  Okay\n So early in the process the sounds start to change\n\n\nthe uh  the " d" is dropped from that\n\nconsonant cluster is reduced to an " n" sound and the\n\n" t

Yes\n\n<$A>  Okay\n Go om go tell yu ma go om go tell yu\n\nma<,,>\n Why do you think that " ma" should come before\n\n"  muma"\n\n\n a bit closer to the English than uh " \n\nmuma"\n\n\n There is a reason\n What is the reason\n Nobody else in here do you know what the reason is\n Tell me what it is\n\n<$F> " is not\n\nused  again by this generation\n\n<$G> \n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A>  How do you use it\n How do you use it\n Yes how do you use it\n Come come\n Don\'t be shy\n Tell me why there is a difference\n\n Sh\n\n<$H> " as being used\n\nas a curse word\n\n<$A>  Now\n Don\'t get carried away\n Don\'t get carried away\n Remember\n This is the language you speak and this is the country you live in\n" in\n\nthat way you know that that use exists<,>\n And that is probably what is influencing you to think that\n\n" ma" is perhaps a little closer to standard than "\n\n muma"\n" is also not used by the\n\npresent generation to address a parent anymore in fact they\'re all using\n\n" ma"\n\n<$students> \n\n<$A>  The set that\'s younger than you now they\'re saying "\n\nma"<,,>\n young people\n\nis correct not really apart from when you\'re using it for abuse\n\nsomebody\n\n\nseveral-words-due-to-students-talking</unclear>But as far as I am\n\nconcerned " ma" is simply an abbreviation of "\n\n muma" therefore there shouldn\'t be any real\n\ndistinction but you guys seem to feel a difference and I think that what is\n\nbehind it is the fact that "  muma" is also\n\n   an</= abusive term\n\n<$students> Yes\n\n<$A>  Okay\n followed by the\n\n"  muma" for that reason because you\n\nknow when you\'re gonna abuse people you move towards the\n\nbasilect right\n\n<$I> \n\n<$A>  Well it depends on who you want to abuse\n who you\n\nwant to abuse\n Alright\n go\n\non om go tell yu muma<,> say Jaaj ded\n\n know why disparaged because they\'re\n\ncoming one after the other\n But if you have to put them in some kind of order it seems that a\n\nlot of people would choose my first\n\n\n\n\n\n<$students> \n\n<$A> \n What\'s the difference\n What\'s the difference between " go on om" and\n\n"  galang om"\n\n\n Ah that\'s the difference that I hear\n because\n\nyou were having another class over there\n\n of\n\nchasing<,> " \n\ngalang"\n Alright\n So I would say that there isn\'t a great difference in terms of\n\nlevel between "  go om" and " \n\ngalang"\n\n\ngalang" as of chasing a person that make it seem\n\ndifferent\n No no no no\n No no I\'m not saying it\'s incorrect not saying it\'s incorrect I\'m\n\nsaying it\'s about the same level but it has a slightly different connotation\n So since what I\'m testing is level if you were to write "\n\n galang" I\'d have no problem with it\n But I\'m pointing out that there could be a little difference\n Alright\n go tell yu muma say Jaaj\n\nded\n Nothing else you would change\n\n<$I> \n\n<$B> \n\nwords</unclear>\n\n<$A>  Yes we could drop it but that\'s not what I\'m looking for\n There is something very important that everybody is ignoring and\n\nI\'m surprised\n"\n\nis optional and that\'s fine\n But there is something else that you haven\'t interfered with and I\n\nam wondering why nobody has tried to change it\n Ah\n Let me hear how you would do it\n Somebody else just mentioned it\n\n\nom"\n" don\'t they\n\n I can\'t hear her\n Sh\n\n Sh\n Uhm ladies and gentlemen you are all testing the sentences aloud\n\nand therefore all I get is a buzzy  I don\'t hear anything\n You have to test it in your\n\nhead\n Mhm\n Galang a yu yard go tell yu

other half\n Yes\nstudents-talking-and-\n\nlaughing\n\n Let\'s say I divided it up that way and I asked you to explain to\n\nme the sequence of the changes and how you would describe the changes taking\n\nplace\n Let\'s say you look at this group of sentences this group this\n\ngroup this group\n\n\nsentence\n You already referred to the first group and you or somebody\n\npointed out that the

\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$B>  Okay\n Uhm so uhm when in Zambia for example subsidies are removed for\n\nhealth care and education\n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B>  uhm structural\n\nadjustment policies are

education  <- > good uhm  a well balanced educational\n\nsystem uhm\n\n\nespecially for the elderly and for the disabled uhm was greatly affected in a\n\nplace like Uganda for example in the nineteen nineties because of structural\n\nadjustment programmes because when government cuts expenditure which is what\n\nis required by the structural adjustment programmes are in these areas then\n\nyou find that channeling    the resources into the\n\nmacro-economy<,>    to enable this restructuring for\n\nthe repayment of debts within that whole framework\n\n\nareas that we speak about education and health and then   uhm  <- > in  in the presentation you might\n\nhave wanted to speak a little about patron clientelism and how it affects\n\nthis\n While all of these conditions take place patron clientelism worsens\n\n   the effect of the structural adjustment\n\npolicies that are introduced manipulated by    the\n\npolitical directorates that still though advocating multi-party systems for\n\nthe improvement of democracy and hence democratisation still have these uhm\n\nexisting qualities of uhm  <- > or  or non qualities you\n\nknow of uhm<,,> health care being reduced and resources being wasted\n So wastes of resources does in fact tie in to what you are saying\n So if you are going to say that it is skewed more towards\n\ndevelopment you can also include whether it is negatively skewed towards it\n\nbecause you can skew positively too right\n So but uhm the whole character of the structural adjustment\n\npolicies especially in sub- Saharan Africa has been to increase for example\n\nthe Aids crisis\n Hm\n\n\n<$A>  I'm sure that they\n\nhave like uhm a reduced subsidy on the health<,>\n\nproducts<,> but people are still unable to afford\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Right\n Exactly\n criticism for the\n\nstructural adjustment policy\n\n\n special  credits and persons in the rural areas\n\nfor example in Nigeria who practice subsistence farming and they're unable\n\nto<,> buy some of these equipment\n So we find access as one problem\n\n\n in uhm the sub-Saharan Africa and in Nigeria for a particular\n\nexample because when you have the rural urban divide you find that the urban\n\nsectors benefit most from the credits and as you mentioned stuff like patron\n\nclientelism  <- > we  we mentioned things like the uhm\n\ncontracts<,> also being awarded to these urban dwellers\n And you might have wanted to include in that too ethnicity\n Hm\n argument ties in with\n\nthe whole idea of structural adjustment when a particular ethnic group\n\nintroduces these policies\n The credits that are reduced by cutting government expenditure\n\nthose<,> particular resources that are kept are geared towards    the supporters of parties\n Hm\n and we find also happening in\n\nKenya\n we find it happening in\n\nGambia<,>\n Mhm we find it happening in the Cameroon\n Those are some of the places\n\n\n we compare the political uhm realities of the patron clientelism\n\nand we compare the economic policies of restructuring with the reduction in\n\nsubsidies at the same time\n\n\n  a great package that is uhm   \n\nit has a lot of ideals in it to be realised\n\n\n in the presentation one could stay above some of these problems\n\nbecause with the short term<,> uhm    the\n\nAfrican countries would not be able in such a short space of time to\n\nrestructure their economies to facilitate the loan repayment that is\n\nnecessary while at the same time continual borrowing takes place as has been\n\ntaking place from in the nineteen eighties<,> on into the nineteen nineties\n\nup until the present era\n\n\n  when we try to explain the relevance of\n\nstructural adjustment policies to democratisation and development in Africa\n\nand by relevance we look at whether    it is good\n\nfor the African continent or whether it is bad for them\n political\n\nwill\n\n\nin a very desultory fashion moving from place to place that is to say\n But uhm what we need is specificity\n You need to say for example that with the political will in place\n\nthe structural adjustment policies because we need politics and economics to\n\nwork together to bring about the promotion of development and democratisation\n\nwhilst you spoke about the emplacement of institutions under the institution\n\nbuilding approach\n At the same time there is supposed to be evident within the\n\napproaches of structural adjustment the type of    liberalisation affects development\n\nbecause    it means that we remove\n\ncertain subsidies of health care education for example\n And we also need to educate the people about what structural\n\nadjustment is about\n order to facilitate\n\nfreedom of enterprise which is necessary one also has to develop the skills\n\nto bring about this free enterprise management on the African continent for\n\ndevelopment of families\n\n\nenterprises like public enterprises or private enterprises but\n\nvoluntary groups that develop need resources in order to help uhm communities\n\nand to represent them and representation and empowerment is a part of\n\ndemocratisation and if it affects democratisation these are the issues\n\nparticipation but more empowerment which means that we not only<,> uhm try to\n\nassess what is the usefulness of participation or the meaning of\n\nparticipation on the African continent but how Africans themselves can\n\nimprove their own situation<,> to make it better and not only rely on\n\ngovernment whether they fall under the totalitarian<,> regime or the one that\n\nis more autocratic\n Or we look at more multi-party systems or those pluralistic in\n\nnature given that uhm    we see that the African\n\ncontinent is very diverse and very heterogeneous\n try to put a single point at which\n\nwe can achieve something known as social capital where social capital\n\ndescribes and social capital was mentioned in some of

relevance of structural\n\nadjustment policies on the African continent and if we are to mirror it in\n\nthe realities of the African state that is how we are supposed to do the\n\nrestructuring so it's a modified type of structural adjustment\n\n\nthe development    over the years\n\nconsidering that uhm the Cotonou Agreements have been introduced<,> right\n So we look at all the different areas that are affected so that\n\nwe're able to pinpoint social and democratic\n And what is the idea of development as you mentioned before\n form of yeah\n\nyeah standard    of development  <- >   when you talk about democratization yes but\n\ndevelopment itself is the improvement in the material conditions and\n\nsometimes even the psychological conditions   \n\nof uhm a person's well-being hm\n It speaks to well-being you mentioned something about self-esteem\n That also has to do with the work place\n Under structual adjustment there is retrenchment and with\n\nretrenchment it means that persons are laid off because of the new free\n\nenterprising and public sector is cut because the public sector budget is cut\n\nfor education and health the public sector is also cut with  \n\n the number of workers that are to be paid and so they should be\n\nmoving to the private sector where    the incentive\n\nscheme is supposed to be more attractive\n But at the same time we find another monopoly developing where the\n\ncredits as I said the access to credits happen in the urban areas by the more\n\nwealthy and well-off\n They take these credits for themselves and so the poor areas\n\nsuffer<,> certain provinces suffer<,>    as you'll\n\nfind in Zimbabwe<,> hm\n sub-\n\nSaharan Africa but South Africa in particular these areas show you\n\nthe whole divide with the suburban and urban divide and provincial divisions\n All of these help to explain how structural adjustment might be\n\nrelevant to one part of the society even more than the other so we can say it\n\nis relevant to have structural adjustment for   \n\nthe elites or the more wealthy\n In uhm Nigeria for example it's more relevant to their well-being\n\nbecause they have the access they have the financial stability to promote it\n\nbut the poorer section the women the children other disabled groups elderly\n\nthey do not get the access to some of the credits they do not get    the representation also that is necessary because when we\n\nhave a particular ethnic group in power that blocks access to certain groups\n\nfor getting certain uhm benefits hm some of the subsidies we talk about that\n\nare removed    are geared   \n\nto  <,>  their particular\n\nparties their particular supporters<,> in that respect\n So in assessing the whole argument one has to do it because it

it really the fault of structural adjustment in its pure form\n\n hardly/further or is it that the interpretation of it the\n\nimplementation of it the formulation of the ideas and the importation of the\n\nideas on the African continent have not been uhm within the whole framework\n\nthat is necessary to promote this development or the ideas that were\n\nexpressed therein<,,>\n Is it a matter

So it's the same thing\n different variations\n\nthat exist but we choose among alternatives hm so   \n\nshould it be that the developed country perspective should be merged\n\nwith a domestic one in

move to another level to ensure that\n\nthis programme is successful and sustainable\n Right\n The thing is we cannot be operating at an associate degree level\n\nand at the end of the day we graduate our first cohort at the certificate\n\nlevel\n You will be noticed you have to move on to other levels right\n So in order for your degrees to have any value at all you have to\n\nshow that you have graduated at the associate degree level\n Why I said this why I've started this class because I'm trying to\n\nget across to you that this levels demands a little more work a little more\n\ndiscipline a little less spoons feeding so to speak and more enterprising\n\n\nright\n And try to gather information to answer those questions as they\n\ncome along\n If you noticed what I did was actually give you an outline of the\n\ncourse so that those persons who are a little more enterprising can actually\n\nfinish the course and use the classes as review classes\n\n\nduring  during the class\n\nno one class will be able to offer you<,> a complete comprehensive total view\n\nof the subject within that three hours the only expectation  \n\n is an introduction to that area\n The expectation then is that having been introduced to that area\n\nyou'd have taken the initiative this is another level to go and do your own\n\nresearch your private reading and your private questioning\n\n\nthat needs to be asked or questions that you need answers to you can\n\nalways demanding from the book or from the lecturer\n You understand what I'm saying\n in\n\nterms of neutral contract the lecturer here and you the student\n because we teach at grade one\n\n\ngrade six perhaps\n\n\nwork it's a different level\n\n\nwords</unclear>\n Isn't that true based on experience isn't that true that the method\n\nof delivery within the high school system becomes different\n Up to the third form level maybe it has another level but when\n\nyou're thrust into the fourth form level you're requested another level of\n\nskills isn't that true<,>\n And most persons who are more successful at this level passing the\n\nO-level so to speak from the high school level are persons who have already\n\ndeveloped the skill for what you call initiative\n is really\n\nplanting the seed but you have to water it at home\n sort of\n\ncollocation for it beat the books at home in order to be successful\n You cannot get everything in the classroom\n And I am just talking about high school level now\n We haven't gone to the certificate level as yet\n The certificate level is another level again a little more\n\nenterprising where you are given fixed text<,> alright\n introduction to marketing\n\neverybody knows that we are gonna use  Cutler's marketing management\n\nbook<,> right\n And we know that is the course M S four three eight or whatever it\n\nis\n\n\nregurgitate right\n We read we come back we respond this and the material that is there\n\n How many persons did a certificate any programme in certificate\n\n within the\n\ntertiary school institutions it calls for more analysis it calls for maybe\n\ntwo or three more   uhm  books\n Isn't that true\n you're\n\nnot going to ask  you to just  regurgitate one book and\n\n carry the/care to response on that\n You're going to do a little more analysis of various writings and\n\nget a feedback\n So therefore at that level the lecturer the marker marks you for\n\nanalysis also\n So therefore what I'm saying we're not at the certificate level\n\nwe're not at the high school level we're not at the diploma level what level\n\nare we\n\n<$student0> \n\n<$several-students> \n\n<$student1> \n\n<$student2> \n\n<$student3> \n\n<$students4>  degree\n\n<$A>  An associate degree level\n U Tech I N P these\n\ninstitutions have  all offered associate degree programmes\n\n\nfirst year  first year in the full-time programme at the\n\nUniversity of the West Indies and the first two years in the part-time\n\nprogramme at the University of the West Indies\n So in other words this is not a play thing\n This is not a baby this is not baby food\n You're no longer at that level\n Some of you will be comfortable with it\n but\n\nthe  but what happened the success at the end of it at the end\n\nof this programme it does not depend on me at this stage<,,>\n You know what success depends on\n\n\n  to do whatever is necessary to make those\n\nchanges to prepare you for that level\n For those persons who have gone beyond the degree level and have\n\ndone masters will recognise that the degree level    is\n\none level\n The masters level takes it another level it's a bigger picture\n And it also prepares you for the P h D level which is another so to\n\nspeak giant to conquer\n Or in a more positive way it's another set of tools or skills to\n\ndevelop\n But why am I saying all of this\n I'm saying all of this to say to you each individual to challenge\n\nyou to take a self analysis a thorough analysis of yourself\n where\n\nyour weakness<,>  where your weakness lies and try to do\n\nsomething about it\n Don't depend on too much external motivation forces or external\n\ninfluencing forces to    fulfil that gap\n and wherever it is reach for it\n\nand take it out of it\n Go for those skills that will make you successful the ability to\n\nread widely the ability to analyse stuff at a certain level the ability to\n\nprobe the ability to question the ability to   \n\ntake up your own questions and seek answers for them\n That is the level that is required here\n If you find yourself as an

facilitating your whole personal growth and development\n I am saying to you\n You have a responsibility to develop yourself\n You understand what I'm saying\n It's not spoon feeding anymore where you feel heavy because all of\n\nthis stuff comes down on    on the lecturer's\n\nshoulder to take you to that level no   \n\nnot there anymore\n It is your responsibility\n Your responsibility to measure your own progress and do what is\n\nnecessary to take you to that level and beyond\n And I'm serious about that\n If you have not grasped this concept at the associate degrees level\n\nthere is a

inquiry\n\n<$C>  six\n\n<$A>  as being\n\npolices to be the exercise of state power for constraining social and\n\npolitical action\n Further he noted that the defining\n\nfeature of the police is its institutional\n\nclaim to the right to use    legitimate\n\nforce within the sovereign    territory of\n\nthe state and that the primary universal value associated to the police force\n\n   the police role of ex-colonial\n\nsocieties is that of order not justice which is interpreted in its\n\nconcreteness as defence of the existing order and\n\nthus<,,> represent the   uhm special interest  dominant in that\n\norder<,>\n\n\nwith reforming ex-colonial constabularies<,> uhm\n For me I identified the style of policing and the style of policing\n\nwithin ex-colonial police force well    based\n\non Harriott I think he was making reference to Jamaican<,> uhm experience \n\n  is a paramilitary style afternoon    which according to Harriott is a complex of\n\nrelationships based on political values that favour    the primacy of order and freedom and justice of\n\norder not freedom and justice\n\n Uhm Harriott paramilitary is more the police go out more to\n\nmaintain order within the society without taking into consideration    the government and not\n\nfor the individual per se\n\n\nssay<,>\n\n Pardon me\n\n<$D>  it don't\n\nmaintain order for  <- >   the\n\nsociety\n\n<$D>  society only for\n\ngovernment\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  in\n\nterms of say for an individual for the individual\n\n<$D>  In what way\n\n<$A> \n\nit    in their opinion that is\n\nmaintaining society if it means to bring in control but it abuses your rights\n\nin\n That's what I'm trying to say\n\n<$D>  Okay\n Well you've said it now\n\n<$A>  Uhm the reaction of the police to the citizens therefore is\n\nthat of they treat them as subjects rather than people and this behaviour\n\nstems from colonialism\n that\n\nuhm    because paramilitarism is the\n\noutcome of colonial security policing the style of policing is based on\n\nnon-interaction and not consensus\n\n\nsou  a source of socially destructive\n\nconflicts<,><,>\n Afternoon\n Ex-colonial police was designed primarily to preserve order keep\n\nthe lid on in hostile environment and to suppress mass outbreaks against the\n\npeace\n\n\nperper  perpetuate the practises which existed during\n\ncolonial times and which    legitimise\n\ntheir behaviours\n would\n\nmore like  would today    use uh like\n\nwater    to quell uh public disturbance while the\n\npolice officers in say developing countries would more likely turn up with\n\ntheir guns or tear gas which is more corrosive force and brutal force than\n\nwould have preferred by society by people<,,>\n the culture\n\nwithin the society is one that uh undervalue the rights of individuals while\n\nthe subculture within the force is characterised by masculine values  <- >\n\n  action-oriented love of guns bond of secrecy and\n\nviolence\n\n<$F> \n\n<$D>  Bond of what\n\n<$A>  Secrecy\n\n<$D>  Okay\n\n<$A>  What should exist in today's world however is a police force\n\nwhich is built on police citizens relations<,,>\n\n\nis the cost of distrust and fear from the citizens towards police\n\nofficers\n Harriott noted that generally censor to the police for false arrest\n\n   malicious procedure law are subject only\n\nto civil action\n has been physically abused what the\n\ncourt should probably do    is offer some small uhm\n\ncompensation but    the actual incident will not be\n\n   placed on the police file\n So he really is not uhm punished for it\n in the\n\nhuman and physical<,> section of the police force\n lower\n\nranking officers are employed with I think it's three O-levels    this I believe is because of the remuneration package\n\nthat is offered because of the limited resources in developing states and as\n\nI said before ex-colonial constabularies would be found in developing states\n\nuhm<,,>\n this\n\nthis  this limit is reflected in the behaviour of the police\n\nofficers\n this could be\n\nused to explain to an extent the reasons why police officers\n\nwillingly accept bribes\n\n ex-colonial\n\nconstabularies still practice the promotion based on seniority and\n\nexperience uhm therefore the individuals<,> who are\n\npromoted and have not furthered their education uhm or go on any additional\n\ntraining    would take with them the\n\nolder    methods and principles of policing\n\nand would issue instructions    top down to\n\nthe lower ranking staff and therefore the same principles  <- > that\n\n that they're trying to reform would perpetuate<,,>\n The structure and culture of the organisation may be viewed to be\n\nanother problem\n\n\nthe hierarchical structure of the force which is based on centrality of\n\ninformation and control from the top\n The centralisation of power within the police force is a legacy\n\nwhich was inherited from colonial times and allows the organisation to retain\n\nits rigid hierarchy\n Harriott noted that police resist internal changes so\n\ntherefore reforms are usually externally   \n\nimposed and managed top down again uhm\n\n\n dependence of foreign experts who tend to perpetuate the slavish\n\nimitation of inappropriate reform packages    that\n\nare often the outcome of ideological political battles fought at a\n\ndifferent time and place\n\n\nis the job security thing\n\n\ncorruption are    more times than not\n\ntransferred to other stations within the force and not\n\ndischarged or punish<,,>\n\n The culture of the force has become acceptable that is brutal force\n\nand corruption and therefore officers tend to resist any change    which threatens the status quo\n Harriott put forward that reform strategies that are anchored in a\n\nsolid information base are better able to negotiate the inevitable\n\ndifficulties and resistant to change<,,>\n Notwithstanding the problems of reforming colonial constabularies\n\nhowever it is possible to reform the force by providing tailored training\n\nprogrammes for not just a selected few but for everyone enforce more\n\nstringent disciplinary measures involve civil society  \n\n and promote reform-minded officers\n Harriott assumes that the major challenge facing the force is to\n\nevolve an authentic consensus building style of policing suitable to Jamaica\n\nconditions\n New challenges require new methods new ways of thinking younger and\n\nmore educated individuals to address them\n Developing countries must consent to pursue reforms\n In the Jamaican context one major step forward is the ongoing\n\nprocess expressed in the  corporate strategy\n someone-\n\ncoughing-in-backgroundmajor the  the major problem lies in\n\nthe fact that ex-colonial constabularies exist in developing countries which\n\nI said before which suffer from limited resources and are unable to provide\n\nbetter remuneration training infrastructure and attract more qualified\n\nindividuals whose mindset would    re-\n\nsocialise the existing order\n That was it\n\n<$D>  Any comments\n\n\n\n<$G>  that's\n\nit related <unclear> words</unclear><,,>\n doesn't seem to solve the\n\nproblem and also\n she\n\nmentioned just she talked about the police only   but you\n\nneed\n\n<$D> \n\n<$G>  No\n\n<$D>  Anybody else have any comments\n\n<$F>  Yeah\n she spoke about uhm\n\nthe  council tends about <unclear> words</unclear> where uhm uhm\n\nforeign people people from abroad come to assist\n I know that there's some negatives to that because they are\n\nsometime not uhm aware of the environment in which   uhm the\n\npolice work and\n Yeah the culture but isn't it uhm good for them to like share\n\nknowledge and experience and<,>\n side because speaking about\n\nlike all the drug trade where there's a link between uhm countries in terms\n\nof drugs wouldn't it be uhm beneficial if countries collaborating or  uhm sharing techniques different techniques and new ideas as to how to\n\n   fight crime\n\n<$E> \n\n<$D>  Good for\n\nwhom\n\n<$D>  It's but I mean both are important points because coupled\n\nwith    the positives that you can get from it and\n\nof course resources you got some  boats the other day   to\n\n<unclear> word</unclear> or whatever the special names are\n Uhm you still have a problem of sovereignity for example this\n\nmorning was it Ernie Smith who was saying that   \n\nhis client wasn't you know that kind of\n So you have the challenge of sovereignity and which one should\n\ntake precedence but of course if you have clearly defined rules of the game\n\nand players who observe those rules it should be easier or more manageable\n\n\n<$student>  Yes\n\n\n<$H> \n\nthe U S was uhm much in Jamaica saying that we need far more\n\nstringent laws as to relates to drug traffic as a  final thing\n\n<unclear>

that is necessary because where do\n\nyou like uhm some information that it cannot really uhm just put it out there\n\nto everybody it's information like uhm about criminal about witness and all\n\nthose things so it cannot really be that    you\n\nmust like decentralise uhm information in the police force\n supposed to be a\n\nlittle of uhm centralised American information is concerned in the force\n\n<$D>  What is the relevance of that to the question\n\n Anybody knows what the question is asking except\n\nfor\n\n<$D>  Well she did speak to that seniority complex and the culture\n\nof you know being in   the force not based on various on education\n\nlevel<,>\n\n It that's very important because you can have rules a lot of rules\n\nand if you don't have people to

{'text': "<$A>  Uh welcome back to P S O J viewpoint as this evening we look at\n\nthe subject of liberalization and deregulation<,>\n I believe that uhm when these policies were announced by government\n\nthere were some stated objectives and I suspect that is a good place for us\n\nto start<,> to look back    on what the objectives\n\nthat were stated uhm by government on these two very important policies of\n\ntheirs<,>\n Who wants to kick off here\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  I guess the main\n\nobjective of  <- > the  the exercise as the government put\n\nit was to make the  <- >   economy more\n\nefficient and to be able to compete more effectively in the world\n\nmarketplace<,>\n uhm having to\n\ndo with how uh prices are set in the economy<,> making sure that prices\n\nreflect<,> the forces of demand and supply in the market<,>\n distortions which\n\ncould be introduced by<,> regulation of government of either prices or\n\n<$A>  Wages\n\n<$B>  Or wages which is also a price\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  And also the price of the uh rate of exchange\n\n<$A>  Hmhm hmhm\n\n<$B>  But uhm as I said the main objective as stated was to make the\n\neconomy more efficient and more competitive\n\n<$C>  Hmhm well if I might say that Anthony Johnson\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$C>  When uhm these policies were announced somewhere about\n\nnineteen eighty-five<,> there were two uhm things that were<,> bearing on the\n\ngovernment's agenda at the time<,>\n of investors and\n\npotential investors in Jamaica who were asked what is it that you would like\n\nto see uhm to<,> uhm<,> permit you or to give you an incentive to do uh\n\ninvestment in Jamaica<,>\n\n\ninvar  invariably uhm said bureaucracy<,>    was the major difficulty that they were having and\n\nanother<,> issue was the problem of licences for getting<,> various items\n\nthat they would have needed from raw material capital goods what have you<,>\n very\n\nsurprisingly they didn't mention very much<,> uhm fiscal incentives like\n\nincome tax free and what have you they didn't mention that they mentioned\n\nthese things and so the government was minded to looking at this\n\n<$A>  Hmhm\n\n<$C>  was the World Bank and the I\n\nM F and the friendly group of bankers called the Paris Club<,> who also came\n\nup with a program which is usually up-fronted by the I M F uh which called\n\nfor a range of policies that would allow the Jamaican economy to be more\n\nefficient<,> would allow uhm Jamaica to be more competitive in the\n\ninternational marketplace and would allow<,> uh capitalists whether local or\n\nforeign to see Jamaica as a place in which to invest money<,>\n initial uh starting of these policies\n\n\n government of the\n\nday<,> uh my government of which I was a minister at the time uh felt that\n\nthese policies had to be handled very very carefully<,> because<,> as both\n\nthe studies said and as Mister Seaga never tired of saying at the time he was\n\nMinister of Finance<,> the Jamaican economy is a very fragile thing<,> and<,>\n\nit is difficult to get growth and having gotten the growth it is difficult<,>\n\nto build upon it<,>\n\n swifter rate if you are\n\nnot careful<,> and with the difficulties that we have<,> in the economy we\n\ncall them structural rigidities which exist the lack of\n\nadequate infrastructure and the lack of<,> a large pool<,> of managerial and\n\ntechnical<,> labour<,>\n Uh it means that whatever it is that you're doing you have to be\n\nvery very careful because<,> if not you can upset the whole applecart and\n\nlose<,> whatever little you might have upon which<,> hopefully you hope to\n\nbuild for the future\n\n<$A> \n The program in fact did start in the eighties and uhm the pace\n\nincreased and uhm in the nineteen nineties<,>\n Focussing on liberalization of the foreign exchange uh control\n\nregime uhm two of the objectives stated by the minister in his presentation\n\n   to the House I think in    nineteen ninety-one<,> were to increase export and\n\nalso to increase uhm<,> to increase investment<,> foreign investors coming\n\ninto Jamaica<,>\n Jamaica Manufacturers\n\nAssociation Mister Anthony Hyde<,> perhaps you may want to give us your\n\nviews<,> as to how we have been doing    in these\n\nareas\n\n<$D>  Okay Vivien uh we have at the Manufacturing Association have\n\noften called<,> for the<,> right playing field to create uh<,> an atmosphere\n\nwhere we can invest<,>\n\n\nderegulation can create that atmosphere<,>\n at the basis of a sound economy\n\nand<,> I think<,> that is the whole objective of deregulization to get the\n\neconomy at a level where<,> interest rate in uhm inflation is down to low\n\nsingle digits<,> uh and which will be matched by<,> interest rates<,> a\n\nstable economy where in the productive sector one needs to project for very\n\nlong periods and you need an atmosphere of a stable economy in which to do\n\nthat<,>\n the economy\n\nfinally reaches that stage<,> without and I think as Tony just said investors\n\nweren't asking for<,> basic uhm incentives like interest- free duty-free \n\n  imports and so on\n\n\n Investment in the productive sectors be it manufacturing\n\nagriculture<,> becomes<,> more<,> feasible in that<,>   \n\nat the stage we are we have choices investment choices\n We can invest in the stock market\n in government securities which are going at very\n\nattractive rates all of these are far more attractive now<,> than the rate of\n\nreturn you get on investment in any of the productive sector<,>\n productive\n\nareas<,> will offer the same level of return they're offering now\n But the level of return you will get on investment in competing\n\nareas will probably be far less and so it will become more attractive to\n\ninvest in the productive sector than it will be<,> to invest in those other\n\nsectors<,>\n that we\n\nneed to create that right environment\n\n<$A>  So uh what are you suggesting that we are not managing the\n\neconomy right\n\n<$D>  has never been\n\nproperly managed\n\n Our country it has seen our currency fall from seven cents to one U\n\nS dollar to a state of almost thirty<,>\n I've seen record inflation rates over periods\n You certainly can't call that managing an economy\n terms of\n\nrate of growth<,> when you see governments that are becoming so\n\nrobust<,> that they can't finance themselves<,>\n oxygen because they\n\ncannot garner enough resource to fund their operations<,>\n\n I call that wrecking an economy\n\n<$C>  Uhm well I would like to say that on the two bases that you\n\nused we don't have to be emotional we can be quite objective<,> uhm one was\n\nto increase exports\n\n\nhave not increased over the last uhm<,> uh two three years<,>\n Uh now some might say that it is due to softness in the bauxite\n\nalumina prices and that is true\n And also the fact that the prices of uh sugar which is our other\n\nlarge export has has held off<,>\n export performance has\n\nbeen<,> relatively<,> uhm level\n Certainly hasn't been any spurt and in so far as investment is\n\nconcerned that is where the real the real problem is<,>\n\n\nI would have almost said none<,>\n could say uh but that\n\nwould be being untrue because there is always some little investment due to\n\nthe fact that the accounts have a thing called capital consumption\n\nallowance<,>\n but in terms\n\nof putting up a building and putting people to work or somebody coming and\n\nannouncing something<,> uhm that is going to<,> increase<,> the total\n\ncapacity of the country<,>\n\n and in\n\nthe financial sector\n\n<$D>  What about the tourism sector\n\n<$C>  Well you know any new hotel that has been uhm that has been uh\n\nbuilt    of spurt that this economy needs<,> is to have<,>\n\nreally large investments in the areas that are targeted like in the garment\n\nindustry if that is to be<,> in the telecommunication industry if that is to\n\nbe<,> in the<,> hotel industry uh other tourist facilities attractions<,>\n significants amount if we are to deal\n\nwith this hundred and seventy thousand unemployed people uhm who<,> after all\n\nreally is the basic problem of the economy\n\n<$A>  Hmhm\n\n<$C>  many\n\nthings  you know\n\n\nuhm mentioned<,> the difficulty of inflation\n And I think that this is one of the really cruel things in our\n\ncountry<,> that the rate of growth of money supply\n that\n\nthe country is drowning in money<,>\n\n\nperson who is not a graduate in economics and hear that  they'll split the\n\nmoney/there's-plenty-of-money around  for gold that's a good thing\n\nbut in fact it's a bad thing because the production is not\n\nincreasing<,>\n is\n\ndeclining\n\n<$A>  Hm\n\n<$C>  a few weeks ago the government uh\n\nput out for treasure bills something like six hundred million dollars and\n\nthere was one and a half billion dollars<,> excess<,> demand for it<,>\n Now that is horrible\n\n<$A> \n handle on\n\nthat\n\n<$B>  very significant\n\nforeign investment taking place at this time<,>\n To my uhm certain knowledge the only sector that you would see any\n\nsignificant uhm foreign investment at this time is in the bauxite alumina\n\nsector<,>\n Uhm fact of the matter is that after an agreement with the\n\ncompanies in nineteen eighty-eight we have seen a very significant\n\nmovement<,> upward investment\n there was total investment in the\n\nsector of somewhere in the region of twenty-five million U S dollars<,>\n Uhm in nineteen ninety-one which was the peak year in this period\n\nwe have seen that go up to over a hundred million U S dollars so that is very\n\nsignificant\n other sector in\n\nwhich you would have that magnitude of<,> uh foreign investment taking\n\nplace<,>", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'fa8a9374-04cc-4f37-8461-b3abc76ef3e3', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:52.243750+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': "<$A> \n they\n\ngo into a relapse phase<,>\n\n\nalcoholism<,>  alcohol is a worry to our society because there\n\nare several members within our society who are addicted to the substance<,>\n\nbecause they have a dependency on it\n And these are the ones who have the disease\n\n\nand watching what a parent or another member because we do have extended\n\nfamilies in Jamaica<,> uh consuming large amount of   \n\nalcohol then they too are more likely to become an alcoholic in later\n\nyears and uh hence have the disease of alcoholism\n\n<$B>  in a society though where alcohol is freely and openly\n\nuhm<,> not just used and accommodated but promoted<,>   \n\nin a society where we are reading statistics here that say that\n\nalcohol use is highest in the thirteen to fourteen age group among secondary\n\nschool students<,> is there you think in place enough information and\n\nawareness about the effects of alcohol usage on young people and the fact\n\nthat for many people it can become a gateway drug to other hard substances<,>\n\n<$C>  no and uhm for\n\nmany reasons that\n reason is that when we\n\nlook into our whole our socioeconomics and also our historical<,> uhm reality\n\nin Jamaica alcohol has been<,> uhm used here for years\n In fact that is why we came here a part of the reason we came here\n\n   from the West African coast to work on\n\nthe sugar cane plantations\n\n\nfrom from  from sugar has been alcohol\n\n\n into the use of alcohol to the extent that   \n\nwe don't consider it a problem\n\n\nlook    the data<,>\n\n\n  to sort of distinguish between use and abuse which\n uhm\n\nsituation in which the individual loses control and where the use of alcohol\n\nin fact disrupts their social interaction their family life and occupational\n\nuh performance\n is\n\nthat uhm<,> of the people  <,>  who actually use\n\nalcohol uhm one in ten of such individuals in fact may go on to be abusers or\n\n <,>  to become uhm alcoholics\n So we all have a one in ten risk of becoming alcoholic and\n\ntherefore we have    to bear this in\n\nmind<,>\n\n<$A>  And I'd just like to point out too that in studies done in\n\nJamaica it has been shown that roughly ten to eleven percent of our\n\npopulation are actually alcoholics<,>\n In other words they have the disease already\n Able has just stated\n\n<$B> \n I wanted to ask you Doctor Winter to further elaborate on the whole\n\nquestion of the disease factor of alcoholism and especially the family\n\npropensities towards usage\n are told that a child who has parents\n\nor a parent<,> or a grandparent who was alcoholic needs to be concerned about\n\ndeveloping the habit\n truth of\n\nthis and why this is so<,>\n\n<$A>  Well there are several theories\n\n within a\n\nfamily<,> there might be<,> a genetic bearing although they haven't actually\n\nisolated a gene and given it a name\n But there might be a genetic bearing with a strong tendency for a\n\nsibling to become a alcoholic within the<,> disease setting of alcoholism in\n\na family<,> regardless of who the family member is<,>\n uhm it alcohol\n\nbeing a substance on which one becomes easily dependent<,> and it is an\n\naddicting force<,>\n children of alcoholics\n\nwho have started off just because they saw mother or father or aunt or\n\ngrand  father or grandmother taking the\n\nbeverage<,> they too and also<,> these young uhm<,> ladies in bars<,> who\n\nwere encouraged to have a drink along with a customer<,>\n Due to environmental situation they too today are alcoholics\n\nbecause of the dependency on the substance and it is an addictive substance\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  there is the gene theory and there is\n\ndefinitely the dependence addiction theory\n\n<$B>  two\n\nways of becoming alcoholic\n based on what\n\nyou've inherited from your parents<,>\n And also there's the consistent use to the point where you become\n\ndependent\n\n<$A>  Hmmhm\n\n<$B>  what about women\n\n\nthe patterns    of use and abuse   \n\nand dependence or addiction<,> as it relates to women and as it\n\nrelates to men<,,>\n\n<$C>  as is true for most drugs you find that\n\n   the    use of\n\nalcohol like any other drug is almost twice as high among men compared to\n\nwomen<,>\n with\n\nthe women is that alcohol tend to have a more serious<,> and quicker\n\nphysiological effect    on our women<,>\n consider that women are the\n\nchild bearers uh we must remember that alcohol also    has\n\na significant effect on the unborn baby<,> uhm which has far-reaching\n\nuhm implications uhm because a child who is born   \n\nto a mother who abuse or use alcohol    in\n\npregnancy may in fact uhm apart from being born with a lot of birth defects\n\nmay also develop a lot of behavioural and learning problems later in life\n\n<$B>  we don't hear too much of late about alcoholism in\n\nJamaica and alcohol usage and road traffic accidents<,>\n You know there was a lot of talk about the need for getting\n\nbreathalyzers and we heard quite a flock about it for a while\n rather quietly\n statistics in Jamaica\n Has any studies at all been done to support you know the call for\n\nbreathalysers    and  <,> \n\nthe correlation between alcohol use    and\n\nroad traffic accidents\n\n<$A>  uhm there are various figures that have appeared\n\nespecially in the news media from time to time<,> like in fatal accidents\n John Golders actually made a statement in the\n\nGleaner saying that in<,> fatal accidents fifty-five percent of them are due\n\nto    the use of alcohol and or ganja\n\n\nspecialist<,> is actually now undertaking a study in which he is\n\ngoing to do a hundred fatal cases and determine whether these were alcoholics\n\nor not or the level of consumption\n\n\nthere are traffic accidents involving somebody who is an alcoholic or under\n\nthe influence of alcoholic they can quote statistics that come from abroad\n\n , but not those that are relevant and would hold more weight\n\n <,>  in our judiciary system\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Okay\n\n<$A>  So he's actually undertaking the study now\n\n<$B>  okay it's now fifteen minutes after nine o' clock\n This is JBC radio one\n and this evening we are focussing\n\non alcohol and alcoholism in Jamaica\n\n Do remember that we take your telephone calls this evening\n six four zero two\n\ntwo<,> six four eight zero one and nine nine zero four zero four one<,>\n we have\n\na caller Tony<,,>\n okay\n What about the use of alcohol and its relationship to other drugs\n Some people suggest that a lot of people who use alcohol somehow\n\nstep on to other things whether it is ganja<,> whether they have been coming\n\nup from cigarettes or moving on to cocaine\n\n\n<$A>  uhm there are conclusive figures in the United States\n\nto show that sixty    to seventy percent of\n\nall<,> the users of crack and or cocaine<,> have a history of alcoholism\n\nusage in their family<,>\n that they\n\ndidn't use as their chemical abuse alcohol but went to crack and cocaine\n\nbecause they didn't want what they saw happening within their family to the\n\nalcoholic to happen to them\n\n<$B>  Hmhm\n\n<$A>  they actually resorted\n\nto another substance rather than alcohol\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  poll that was done by Carl\n\nStone in nineteen ninety<,> uhm and I show you this some of the findings that\n\nshow that alcohol users are likely to abuse other drugs<,>\n\n\ntwo percent uhm were more likely to use hard drugs<,> fifty-four\n\npercent ganja and forty-six percent cigarettes<,>\n this suggest that uhm certainly your alcohol users have a\n\npropensity to using other drugs   uhm\n\n<$B>  we just stop\n\nand take a call Dr. Able and come back to this whole matter<,> alcohol as \n\n  it relates to other drugs<,> okay\n Hello good evening this is Addiction Alert\n\n<$D>  Hello good evening\n\n<$B>  Yes mam\n\n<$D> \n\n alcoholic problem\n\n<$B>  Why you

get some help\n\n<$A>  there are two places she could go to\n\n<$D>  Uhu\n\n<$A>  which on an\n\noutpatient basis  ,  over a four to six month period \n\n,  will assist her<,> and help her<,> to shed

word</unclear>\n\n\n that crowd\n think honestly we used to be taught\n\nin my day and that was a long time ago uhm you know parts of speech  \n\n as you mentioned and so on uhm in a way that I don\'t think they\n\nare now so you\'re putting English unfairly at a disadvantage because they\'re\n\nnot teaching it as they used to and it is as I said before the international\n\nlingua franca  , \n For that reason and that reason alone nothing to do with colonial\n\npower imperialism mother country and junk like that uhm we should be learning\n\nit properly\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B>  do we\n\naccomplish two aims simultaneously  , \n sense of self and their dignity\n\nand self-worth by saying to them when they speaking the mother tongue\n\nJamaicans that    you\'re speaking badly or you\n\nmust speak properly or lick it out of their head\n And second the goal\n passes in English and our\n\nability to write and speak English is at a much higher level than it is now\n\n notAchieving those two objectives Carolyn require uh not just\n\nsaying but actually practicing teaching English as a second language\n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$D>  can I just say that one of the\n\nproblems we have is that a lot of the people who are teaching English are not\n\nthemselves competent in English\n\n<$A> \n\n<$D>  And this is not a problem only with English\n and part of the\n\nproblem is that as a nation we do not value teaching and if we did we would\n\nfind some way to make the salaries better so that the people who are in fact\n\nqualified to do teaching will be motivated to stay in the profession\n So that is one of the issues that we don\'t think education is\n\nreally worth the money that is required for us to spend on it  \n\nand it\'s part   of the problem part of the problem <unclear>\n\nwords</unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$E> \n Uhm because uhm if I go back again to the point that in days gone\n\nby I think that people who now  <->   have more\n\ndifficulty with English uh didn\'t have as much difficulty then uhm uh uh uh\n\ndidn\'t have that difficulty because to a great extent uhm teachers were uh\n\nrelatively better paid\n certainly far better regarded\n desirable\n\nprofession and looked on with great respect\n And now it\'s hardly\n sort of more\n\nwealthy schools if    I put it that way you had a\n\nlot of literally uhm Brits uh    as teachers of\n\nEnglish and and other topics <unclear> words</unclear>\n\n<$D> \n\n<$A>  But the conversation is revolving around what is happening in\n\nthe schools  ,   while really ignoring the point that\n\nI think is raised by this morning\'s Observer\n The use of Patois in public broadcasting in public publications\n\n  in the media and so for really\n Carolyn I\'d love to hear you on that I mean\n we speak perfect English at home ha ha\n we have a programme and uh\n\nwho speaks uhm you know in Patois or we have uh as here we\'re going to have a\n\nleading newspaper having it\'s sections in   <unclear>\n\nwords</unclear> television    just address\n\nthat point\n\n\n<$C>   mhm \n\n<$C>   mhm\n\n<$D>  Yes \n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$D> Well you know you\'re talking to somebody who wrote a bilingual newspaper\n\ncolumn for over you know for five years in a national\n\nnewspaper<,> <unclear> word</unclear> and just about now editing\n\nand selection for publication and I\'m amazed at how current the stuff still\n\nis\n You know the harassment\n\nthat I got from people who said you know this language should not be in the\n\nnewspapers that it should not be on the editorial page and so on\n The basic problem we have is that we have contempt for the language\n\n ,  and contempt for the speakers for whom it is their mother\n\ntongue and for whom it is their primary language\n to be\n\nbilingual and we can flex but you know people know that all them have PhDs so\n\nyou know    <-> them</- >  them brighter them have\n\nsense\n The problem is that we have contempt for people for whom this\n\nlanguage is their primary mode of communicating and what C V M is simply\n\ndoing is saying stop a lot of the news that we are giving in English plenty\n\npeople don\'t understand  ,  and if news is about    the Jamaican version of my column were the English\n\nspeakers who felt that uhm you know they shouldn\'t have any difficulty\n\nreading Jamaican and there was something wrong with it because\n And I had to explain to them that there is a writing system that\n\nhas been developed by the linguists\n\n Once you learn it it\'s easy to read\n And then there\'s the other you know sort of arbitrary system that\n\neverybody makes up their own way of expressing you know in writing the\n\nlanguage and so    it\'s kind of    you know harum scarum\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$D>  it\'s just not being\n\ntaught in schools because we don\'t take language  \n\nseriously\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  a dictionary of Jamaican\n\nEnglish   <unclear> word</unclear>\n\n<$C> \n\n<$D>  of\n\nJamaican English    is not really uh uh Jamaican\n\nuhm dictionary an English of the Jamaican language\n\n\n<,> \n\n\nCassidy recognised that what he was doing there was looking at English \n\n usage that was peculiar to Jamaican but a lot of that what\'s being\n\ncalled Jamaican English was really Jamaican\n Now I\'m not the expert\n\n\nare the people you need to be talking to for the technical  \n\ndetail but I don\'t <unclear> words</unclear>\n political campaigner\n\nand    my spirit and my passion are\n\nall invested in this notion that as Jamaican people   we have to\n\ntake our language seriously\n\n<$B> \n\nnow\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$B>  dictionary

\n\nduring my time in <unclear> word</unclear> one of the things I was\n\n  familiar with in Israel one of the   things I was\n\nfamiliar with was when they went to Hebrew as a national language they kind\n\nof uhm vocabulary build-out that had to happen   because it was\n\nsuch an ancient language you know\n Have we done that with regard to Patois\n Because it was used in particular circumstances

{'text': "<$A>  Alright\n Uhm Patrick we move on now\n we\n\nwe  we have up    a little mutual\n\nadmiration      for our next guest who is\n\ncoming on line\n She's none other than Senator Maxine Henry-Wilson who is minister\n\nwithout portfolio in the office of the Prime Minister uh General Secretary of\n\nthe People's National Party and God knows what other role Maxine might hold\n\nwithin this scheme of things but a powerful woman in this island\n Good morning Senator Henry-Wilson\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C> \n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A>  Yes indeed same\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  Same to you\n ha\n\nha  happy to have you here this morning\n A number of issues that we want to raise with you\n something that\n\nconcerns me\n I not sure if it is a broad based concern but I know I am a little\n\nconcerned about it and that is with this Y two K situation<,>\n Now is one of the areas that the government has actually spent vast\n\nsums of money getting in our leased consultants getting on everybody to you\n\nknow revamp and make sure that their systems are compliant<,>\n is\n\nseemingly willing to commit themselves\n\n\nwilling to commit\n So it seems to me that the government has spent this money but at\n\nthe end of the day come December thirty-one stroke January one\n your fingers\n\ncrossed like everybody else\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  Yeah because I think it's and I don't think it's only in\n\nJamaica\n the nature of\n\nthe problem\n I\n\ndon't think anybody is absolutely sure what is going to happen\n\n\n  ninety-nine as one test<,>\n\n\n   technology can be quite\n\nunpredictable\n\n\nwhatever tech  whatever corrective action is necessary uhm\n\nbased on    the arrangements that have been made\n how far\n\nit applies to people in Jamaica but in the United States uhm anybody\n\nwho has anything to do with any computer is not allowed to be off the job\n\nover the next couple days<,>\n that regard\n\nalso since we have been certified some of our systems have been certified it\n\nwould be covered under that but I don't think they can give a hundred percent\n\nguarantee\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  But Minister what bothers me further is that none of the\n\ninsurance companies want to    provide any \n\n sum of coverage either<,>\n So it seems that the whole thing is already as I don't want to say\n\nit's loose\n are\n\nyou  <- > the  the what now the owner of the equipment\n\nyou're    the government of Jamaica  \n\n you're really  a left hole in the  bank if anything\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  Well one of the things that we have done is the uhm okay you\n\nhave all the various compliance which you have been certified for like you\n\nknow  Ikea has certified you on   \n\ncertain things uhm the World Bank independent commissions have come\n\nand looked and uh in addition to that though O D P M  ,  is\n\nthe person who is operating    the sort of back up\n\nsystem that if anything should go wrong this is what will take place\n Uhm so you've tried to provide as much assurance as possible\n it's almost like the\n\nMartian uhm<,> Moonlander you know<,>\n have done everything\n\npossible<,> and at the last minute something could go\n\nwrong<,> And that's the nature of the technology but I think\n\nover the next couple days they have started testing some of the systems and I\n\nthink by the twenty-fourth they will be very clear about you know    what is the situation\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$?> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$A> \n Go wrong\n\n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  little\n\nuhm politics on the ground here<,>\n have the impression that\n\nthere's a referendum as to the sort of uh constitutionary arrangements we are\n\ngoing to have in terms of a monarchy republican type government\n\n\npredict that such a referendum   uhm will come\n\n<$A>  Alright\n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  is a\n\ncommitment first to an indicative referendum<,> I don't think\n\nany date has been settled on it because there are a number of\n\npreconditions<,> to the indicative  <- >  \n\nreferendum<,>\n\n In the interim we're trying to do some legislative changes\n\nincluding the Charter of Rights<,> et cetera\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yeah\n mandate are you\n\nlooking for in terms of a majority positionin the\n Yes in the indicative referendum\n Uh two thirds\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  I think at the well the constitution and I don't think in the\n\nfirst instance<,> this indicative   \n\nreferendum    is uhm provided for by the\n\nconstitution in other words there are some thing that you need a two\n\nthirdsmajority for    I don't\n\nthink that there is any decision on that yet<,>\n I've never heard a decision\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Yes\n I understand\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Yeah\n Alright\n\n<$A>  uhm an\n\nuhm well another aspect of it that has concerned a number of us\n Now in recent times uh we have heard about a number of scandals or\n\ncall it what you will a number of areas of disquiet    other\n\nvariants we have had  on our central scene<,>\n My question is what does the government propose to do to get out of\n\nthis sort    of situation that the institution of\n\ngovernment is not further undermined\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$A> \n Alright\n up because we are on a time break\n\nwe'll come back and we'll give you full latitude to explain that<,>\n Alright\n Thank you very much\n This is first edition\n\n<$C>  \n\n<$A>  Okay nineteen minutes past seven o'clock as we're rejoining\n\nhere on First Edition\n We are speaking with uh Senator Maxine Henry-Wilson minister\n\nwithout portfolio in the office of the Prime Minister and also she wears the\n\nhat of General Secretary of the People's National Party\n the break uhm I asked\n\nyou what does the government propose    to treat to\n\nthe difficulties now that I see\n\n\n  almost uh undermining the institution of\n\ngovernment\n Don't forget the parties\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  right uhm\n\nbecause I think the question is the erosion of trust and confidence\n\n<$A>  Exactly\n\n<$C> \n\nI and probably we need to do it    on a less\n\nformal level is the whole question  <- > of  of trying to\n\ndevelop some partnerships\n\n\nstate has although we say that the government must contract we are still\n\nexpected to do much more than in the past\n Look at Y two K\n That was never a problem there was never a responsibility of\n\ngovernment<,> So we find ourselves engaged in a whole lot of\n\nthings and some of the core responsibilities  <- > are  are\n\nnot being addressed in the way that would give people\n\nsome level of comfort\n\n\n what are our core responsibilities who carries them out and how\n\n\n\n  there are operations\n I think if there is any minister who has tried to scrupulously\n\navoid operations to put in place    a lot of\n\ninfrastructure that is    required for\n\nmodern crime fighting and yet, invariably and inevitably he is blamed for\n\nsome of the operational things and the government not necessarily    the technocrats but    the\n\npolitical administrators<,>  \n\n are held responsible\n Uhm so I think there are some basic service delivery areas that we\n\nhave to look again at the question of partnership and how uhm  \n\n we provide them    for the people\n The other thing is to just say clearly what you can provide\n\n\nquestion of road repairs for example\n\n\nit just end up a combination of factors has made it almost impossible\n\nfor you to meet the mandate\n first\n\nthing that they ask about\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n Yeah sure and I take your point very well minister but you see one\n\nof    the criticisms that I would level uhm at\n\n <- > the  the present regime is that for example whereas\n\nyour head space may well be in the right place regarding roads and road\n\nrepair I look at for example expansion of the what's that Hope\n\nRoad<,> Hope Road    and  Lady\n\nMosgrave and that whole bit there\n And frankly I didn't see that as a pressing priority\n\n\n  start to look to some of the farm roads and some of\n\nthe other areas now where the road service has almost completely\n\ndisappeared<,> as a priority rather than you know not to say you\n\nmustn't do it eventually  \n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  Yeah\n it has been outstanding\n\nfor many many years\n is one section of the road\n\nthat has become increasingly worse and as a consequence there where you had\n\ndone repairs was under threat that if you had a section from uhm    the King's House up to Matilda's Corner that had never\n\nbeen given a kind of uhm    infrastructural\n\nworks    that is required   and it is\n\ndeteriorating but it was also   affecting the lower\n\nsections<,>\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Minister it may hearten you to know that I take a different\n\nview      I Yeah\n Yes yes\n I think it's a wonderful thing that's\n\nbeing done and also we have to remember that we can't just judge\n\ninfrastructure on present need<,>\n Uh social patterns change uh people live and work in different\n\nareas and I believe a wonderful thing is being done and I      and I love it because I'm I'm  used to it\n\n<unclear> words</unclear>\n\n<$C>  well I was expecting that\n That's one of the hard things about government\n\n\ncaught in-between\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  No I'm not saying\n No Patrick\n No Patrick\n I will concede all of\n\nthat\n\n<$C>  another\n\npoint is that is though that you always have to make\n\nchoices<,> and sometimes you are even in your own mind you're\n\nwondering whether you are making    the regime and I think will continue to\n\naffect<,> the regime  straight as well is the whole\n\nquestion of the strengthening of civil society the number of voices that are\n\nbeing heard uhm    the increasing demands and I am\n\nputting all of this as very positive<,> and you're trying to\n\ndistil from that    what are the priorities and you\n\ndistil priorities and people say well that's not it et cetera and the\n\ncommunication then    is important<,>\n\nand    I think we have to rethink how we communicate\n\nwith   people in the present environment\n\n<$B> \n Yeah\n Yeah\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mhm\n\n\n<$B> \n\nminister I think we need    to sort of draw a\n\ndistinction between the blame and responsibility\n\n<$C>  Right\n\n<$B> \n blame may be\n\nat a level different from the minister for example<,> but the\n\nminister ultimately has a responsibility<,> to see that what is\n\nthe policy is implemented\n officer\n\nso and so\n And it seems to me that we need to get back to basics\n all this thing about the salary\n\nwhere the statute the relevant statute for example the case  \n\n of the Bank of Jamaica says clearly what the minister's\n\nobligations are<,> and what his responsibilities are  \n\nand it seems to me that we can't

give her a little uh\n\n<$C>  and\n\nshe'll <unclear> word</unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  I think that what has happened is that well intentioned though\n\nthe initiatives may be they have lost touch with the people in that they\n\nfailed to one educate the people and two to get the response from the people\n in\n\nthe initial stages\n What we have is a reaction of the people and then they wheel and\n\ncome again\n So a number of bits of legislation were probably confident behind\n\nclosed doors\n Of course they went through the ritual of inviting public response\n But nobody has the time for that\n But there was no public education campaign\n So there is where I think the P N P has fallen down and this has\n\ncome with all the bits of legislation\n It has even come with the proposed uh Caribbean Court of Justice\n It has come with nearly everything it has done\n It has been called reacting to public outcry and this was typified\n\nin the gas riots it's typified now in the Corruption Bill and all like that\n\nuh\n\n\nand  and not dealing with the people sufficiently and probably\n\nit is caused by lack of resources that they don't have the resources to go\n\nout and spend the time and they're really outing fires as they go along\n So they have not taken the people into their confidence and in fact\n\nuh the people now are<,> very suspicious of the government\n claim by the\n\nPrime Minister in assuming office that he would be leading a government of\n\naccountability and transparency\n I doubt if we have seen initiative in that respect\n\n<$A>  Alright\n Welcome minister senator Maxine Henry-Wilson general secretary of\n\nthe People's National Party\n We've heard and reviewed an assessment of the two years you know\n\nthe second   anniversary of the People's National Party\n\nreturning to power as a historic third term\n And I don't know have you heard Dr Ashley earlier but he was\n\nhard-pressed to give us uh some positive to indicate that you were on the\n\nright track\n You have an opportunity to respond now and tell us\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D>  Okay\n\n Well was it Dr Ashley who said I was on the right track\n\n<$A>  Dr Paul Ashley\n Yeah\n\n\n<$D> \n Okay\n\n It's the first morning off holidays and I think I got a little\n\ndelayed\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$D>  that if\n\nwe were honest in our own assessment and    which we\n\nplan to be that have there have been quite a few failures but there have also\n\nbeen some successes\n I don't agree with Paul in terms of the legislation\n I think we have tried to make the legislative process as open as\n\npossible\n And some of the legislation which have come to us or which we have\n\ndrafted and prepared have come out of uhm deliberate requests either from\n\nprofessional groups or from policies which are endorsed by  \n\n the people    if you want to call it\n\nthat\n The problem occurs in the actual uh legislative process which I\n\ndon't think people understand and we can be blamed for not uhm appraising\n\nthem fully of it\n Uh let's take the Corruption Prevention Bill\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$D>  That bill was on the table for two years\n We deliberately left it on the table for two years\n Now if you want to say that we did not go out to the populace with\n\nthe bill but it certainly was before all those people who are authorities on\n\nthis matter and uh nobody took the time in fact as I said yesterday I\n\nrecalled several times during the Joint <unclear> word</unclear> Committee\n\nProcess the minister appealing to persons to come before the committee\n Now if people don't have the time well then the government can't\n\nbe blamed\n When people don't have the time and then later they come and say\n Oh you should have done so and so\n We have to adhere to processes because that's a part of governance\n Uhm what have we achieved in the two years\n I think it is true to say that we have done remarkably well in\n\nproviding water and    the evidence is there\n Uh we have some problems with the provision of water the cost but\n\nI say the government has within its resources tried to provide water\n The social investment fund for example which is a government\n\ninitiative supported by international agencies has been an attempt to   bring communities into the process of provision of their\n\nown resources and that has gone very well\n The local government reform process which is a part of the larger\n\nempowerment process   uhm on which our principles are\n\nbased<,> has gone marginally well and we believe that if we are to be true to\n\nourselves all of these things are processes   \n\nrather than destination\n In other words if it has been a learning process for the entire\n\nlocal government this thing including\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$D> The ministers\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$D>  Because the communities are not self-mobilising\n Uhm you have to put in place the infrastructure for the local\n\ngovernment system to work\n They have been totally denuded\n I think what Manchester Parish Council did is an example of where\n\nwe want to get to and some are moving faster than others\n Uhm what we're doing in Portmore\n\n<$A>  Some are not moving at all\n\n\n<$D> \n\nand    all    the <unclear>\n\nword</unclear> organisation    of government and all\n\nand it worries me and persons like myself because  <- > I am not I\n\nam no I have faith but I am not sure we are clear\n Do we know exactly where is it we're going\n\n\n   the control    in\n\nthe system\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D>  reply very much in\n\nthe way in that I did yesterday morning\n I'm feeling the government has the responsibility to establish its\n\nlegitimacy to ensure that there is public order and also to be accountable\n Uh but a government can't do it on its own and I think as a people\n\nwe have to decide on some direction and to move there\n I want to say that uhm during the break I was making the point to\n\nyou that I believe that perhaps the greatest uh  \n\nsin of omission of the administration one of the greatest sins of omission is\n\nour failure to fully come to terms with the present communication\n\nenvironment", 'subdomain':

{'text': "<$A> \n I'm Blossom White and tonight we're talking about man to man\n\nfriendship among men\n have existed\n\nover the years have been friendships between men\n Some of these friendships have existed from the days of being in\n\nschools\n School boys you know wearing short pants\n They have been friends sharing one ice mint or one mint ball or one\n\nparadise  plum\n You know what I'm talking about\n Others have developed through other meetings and situations\n On the other hand some men are afraid of very close relationships\n\nwith other men<,> and the moment they feel warmly toward another man the\n\nhomosexual panic button gets pressed\n Therefore they remain very alone\n they become over-dependent\n\non some woman to fulfil all their emotional needs which does not ever happen\n And then these men become disappointed and frustrated\n But I think men need same sex friends because there are types of\n\nvalidation and acceptance that they can receive only from their gender mates\n they can\n\nonly be shared with and understood<,> by other men\n What is the situation like in Jamaica\n Do men have other men as their good friends as their real brethren\n\n   as we would say\n How important are such friendships man to man\n My guest is Reverend Dave Hazel\n He's pastor at the Lincoln church united\n Lincoln church\n\n<$B>  Lincoln Kirk united\n\n<$A> \n is that\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  That's in Franklin Town\n\n<$A> \n Director of youth ministries for the united church and chaplain of\n\nthe  Camper Down High School\n Reverend Hazel welcome\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Thank you Blossom\n\n<$A>  about this friendship\n\nbetween man and man<,>\n Is it possible for men to have friendship relationships with other\n\nmen\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  think is very\n\npossible<,> uhm and something  <,,> \n\nthat men crave sometimes even  <- > <,> \n\nunaware<,> of that craving and I think that<,>    there is a need there is a craving<,> and there does exist\n\nclose relationships    between men\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  But how important is all of this\n Is it really important\n\n<$B>  think it's important uhm and again\n\nsometimes<,>    we will engage in close relationships\n\nwith other men without even realising the importance that they are right\n remember things that my coach used to\n\nsay<,>\n\n\nmy older peers would say if I might call them that\n one of the things I believe that\n\nis so important<,> in<,> man to man relationships is the whole thing of\n\nmentoring<,>    that men look for\n\nidols for images    for men who  <,>  they can model their lives after men who they feel \n\n  they like what they wear\n\nthey like what they do they like what they move\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  And how many women they keep\n feel a man can't\n\nkeep one woman you know<,>\n They're joking\n mentoring huh\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n  they use    to evaluate\n\n   how man they are<,,>\n it's\n\nimportant for that\n feeling of being\n\nunderstood<,,> that one of the reasons why<,> men will<,> mix a lot with each\n\nother you know is because together  \n\n they find a sense of being understood<,> and    there is an affirmation of who you are as a man\n\n , in a way    that again a woman\n\nmight not fully understand\n men generally are sports\n\nloving people<,> and sometimes women would tend to interpret\n\ntheir sports lovingness if there's such a word as being too\n\nrumpy-rumpy or  admire the beat man low rump so\n the\n\nway a woman would look at it\n men they\n\nunderstand each other\n They understand why they love the sports\n They understand why they'll play domino a whole night\n And they understand why they will talk all night about a football\n\n   or a basketball or a cricket

don't\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Yes because I recently heard yes of a case in which a fellow\n\nhad totally disrespected his mother<,> because she had allowed\n\nherself to be beaten<,> you know\n he felt as if she had no right to stay and\n\n  take all    the   beating\n\nyes yes yes mhm<,,>\n I think some of the causes as we have said apart from\n\nsocialisation is it frustration on behalf of the man<,> jealousy sometimes\n some of the\n\nmen are    so jealous\n I I say I'd\n\nsay  I remember the case I heard about this lady that had been\n\nkilled\n and the man had\n\ncut her throat\n\n I'm not too certain\n\n\n another man<,>\n\n\n\n   was it worth\n\nit   to kill the mother of your children  \n\nyou know<,>\n\n\nknow<,> and the anger and the intolerance<,> mhm\n\n<$B>

not himself and again I have to mention the woman's role\n\nhere<,>\n She tends to be sympathetic with him and say when he is himself\n\n  he's a very nice   man<,>\n,\n\n if he beats you wherever

{'text': "<$A>  Good night\n I'm Helen-Ann Wilkinson with tonight's programme\n who's ill\n Tonight's topic is the rights of the man under the law\n I mean so often we hear about the women's rights children's rights\n\n rights you know whoever rights but sometimes we\n\ndisregard the men\n Tonight our special guest tonight is Mr Alton Morgan who is attorney\n\nat law who has been in practice for the last eighteen years and he\n\nspecializes in family law\n But recently he now practices chiefly commercial law\n He is very involved with the family administries in fact he's been\n\ninvolved with family administries over the    last\n\nnine years\n And was responsible for registering uhm family administries as a\n\nnon-profit organisation\n So he is no stranger to this programme in fact he was on last year\n\nabout this time\n\n No\n Yes we've had our full uhm showers of blessings I guess\n Uhm Mr Morgan is a member of Bethel Baptist Church and he's very\n\ninvolved in the choir there\n He sings and also part of the legal advice committee\n He's married with two children two daughters and his wife is Peggy\n\nMorgan Dr Peggy Morgan\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n Glad to be here\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Yes\n Thanks for coming Mr Morgan\n by telling us a little bit\n\nabout what you think are the rights of the man under the law\n Do men in Jamaica have rights or do they have too much rights\n Are they abusing their rights\n\n<$B>  Well men in Jamaica have a lot of rights under the law thank\n\nGod  , \nand they haven't been curtailed in any\n\ngreat way in    the years since we have had new\n\ndevelopments in our law\n man's primary right to own property\n\nand so on uhm remains the same as it has for the last many hundred years\n What we have seen however is that a lot of the social legislation\n\nwhich has been passed over the last twenty-five years has in many ways uhm\n\nlimited the exercise of those rights\n\n\nright to name a child after yourself as a man\n Uhm there was a lot of discrimination which took place before the\n\nstatus of children's act when children born out of that law could not begin\n\nthe name of their father without the father's consent\n And the practice then was that if it were a boy the father would\n\ngladly give the boy his surname uhm because of the bias of having the name\n\nsucceed\n Whereas the girl would not begin the father's name father wasn't\n\nconsent to have his name on the girl's certificate and  it find the\n\ngirl growing up with the mother's name\n\n\nfather to choose whether to give the name to the child or not<,>\n That was taken away by the status of children's act {\n\n3>which now provides that if it's the man's child then the child has\n\nthe right to the use of the man's name  , \n Uhm we've had other developments in the law for example with the\n\nuhm<,>  Interstates Estates Act\n There a man did it about four years ago to expand the definition of\n\na spouse\n Previously a spouse was someone who was married at the time of the\n\ndeath of the partner\n That definition was changed to include the person in a common\n\nlaw<,> union\n So that in effect uhm again the man lost the right to disown the\n\ncommon law<,> wife\n Simply because he hadn't gone to church with her to make the union\n\nofficial<,> and    she gained the right\n\nto inherit from his estate although he had not left a will\n two years the uhm\n\ninheritance act the provision for family independence<,> act which requires\n\nthat in making a will<,> one has to<,> leave in the will adequate provision\n\nfor dependent relatives\n And that has again taken away another right which men felt they had\n\nexclusively which was the right to decide who would get what of their\n\nproperty<,> whether    the person was\n\ndependent on them or not\n domestic violence bill which\n\nhas further uhm clarified what rights a man may have in respect of the<,>\n\noccupation of the matrimonial home and in respect of the limitations on his\n\nconduct towards family members uhm if he becomes abusive of\n\nthem<,>\n used to be this feeling in\n\nJamaica that a man had a right to beat his wife uhm if the supper was cold or\n\nif she did anything to<,> you know upset him unduly but that so-called right\n\nhas been now clearly defined that    he doesn't have\n\nany such right at all\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  what may be happening\n\ntoday is that women feel now that they have the right to abuse men or\n\nverbally or otherwise   <unclear> word(s)</unclear> men\n\n<$B> \n\nthe  the law is fairly balanced   so that whether\n\nit's the man or the woman who is being abused uhm there is no longer a\n\nprimary right being afforded to either one of them and<,> if either the man\n\nor the women is abused    they can have recourse to\n\nthe provisions of the law to protect against that abuse\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  talking\n\nearlier and you made the point that uhm you thought that Jamaican men    had a lot of restraint so that if women or their women\n\nor the Jamaican woman was too aggressive in any form shape uhm that they\n\nwould be    a bit more controlled than somebody else\n\n , other than man from   you mentioned Eastern\n\nCaribbean\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nye said yes\n have found in my experience in\n\ndealing<,> with family matters that<,> Jamaican men tend to exercise a\n\ntremendous amount of tolerance and restraint in<,> highly abusive situations\n reach their limit\n\n   they tend to go to extremes\n I've had to deal with from the Eastern\n\nCaribbean regions    I find Jamaican men tend to be\n\nuhm far more tolerant and<,> even in the face of abuse I have found that they\n\nare<,> resolute    in doing what is the proper thing\n\nand there're some men who in the face of abuse tend to<,> just throw\n\neverything to the wind and abandon their responsibilities<,> but\n\nI have found that Jamaican men tend to be uhm still quite responsible even\n\n   in the face of abuse<,>\n Mhm\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  I think one of the sore points that I know that uhm I'm going\n\nto be called up on\n I am sure people gonna call in on this uhm is the fact that women\n\nare discriminated in the laws in terms of financial instruments\n Would you like to give me some more details on that and if that's\n\nso on how you think that could be remedied\n\n<$B>  Well yes\n\n\nrather unfortunate situation that we haven't seemed to<,> try to do anything\n\nabout\n The courts in England have over the last ten years uhm passed a\n\nnumber of<,> common law decisions judgements which have shaped the law and\n\nwe're only now being persuaded by them\n to my mind ridiculous practices that financial\n\ninstitutions indulge in<,> seeming to afford the Jamaican man a certain right\n\nwhich it doesn't afford to Jamaican women is to require that<,> when a wife\n\nis co-signing to a loan<,> she should also sign an independent legal advice\n\nclause<,> acknowledging that she has been independently advised\n\nby an attorney before signing the document\n Uhm some financial institutions still use it some have abandoned it\n common law principles are now quite\n\nclear that   whether that acknowledgement has been signed or\n\n  not is of little or no consequence and regard must be had to\n\nall the circumstances of the case\n practice was really designed to protect the bankers or the\n\nlenders against allegations of exercise upon due   influence\n\nupon the<,> wife to cause her to sign away her rights to property or to\n\nassume indebtedness which otherwise she wouldn't have assumed\n anybody who is borrowing\n\nor getting into any financial transaction should get\n\nindependent legal advice<,>\n agreements\n\nwhich uhm financial institutions require people to sign nowadays contain\n\nclauses which are uhm harsh and  unconscionable<,> \n\n<- > and  and if the person isn't properly advised against\n\nimplications of<,> accepting those terms they may find they do so to their\n\nextreme prejudice\n decide to go into a\n\ncontract without proper legal advice whereas women<,> don't seem\n\nto be afforded that right and uhm that's a bit of bias that we still have\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n a common practice now is that women who have acquired property\n\nbefore marriage don't want to accede that to the man because they're afraid\n\nof losing it<,> I mean  <- > why  why I'm\n\nbringing it up is that    we have to look at why we\n\ntalking about in law but for some people that's so far away or it's far away\n\nfrom them but it does impact  them on the family and how do you think\n\nthe family can cope with the legal framing work in which they have to operate\n\nin a society\n Cos as you were saying you think the social structure to some\n\nextent is biased against women and more in favour of men and you know in the\n\nworkplace or in marriage or whatever\n an impact on\n\nhow we relate to each other cos then    the man\n\nwill know he has more power and the woman will say no no no can't bother with\n\nthis man you know because he want take everything I have then\n\nI'm gone off with somebody else\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  rights they are a little\n\nskewed still\n laws we have in\n\nJamaica<,> there is an assumption that<,> property owned by the man<,> is\n\ngenerally available for the use and benefit of<,> his spouse and his children\n a presumption of\n\nadvancement if the man gives something to his wife or  \n\nchildren<,> that he intends for them to have it\n So if for example a man purchases uhm a motorcar or some other item\n\nof property<,> in his name<,> but gives the exclusive use of it to<,> his\n\nwife or child the law would tend to presume that<,> although it's in his name\n\nhe intends for them to have it\n where a woman has\n\nproperty<,> and makes it available for the exclusive use    of her husband or children it is still<,> assumed and\n\nunderstood to be her property exclusively,\n assets\n\nhowever    I find is more a question of<,> trust in\n\nthe relationship rather than real principles of law\n parties trust and\n\nunderstand each other sufficiently then<,> there shouldn't be this need to\n\ndraw hard lines defining who owns what\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  I think we're gonna take a call on line two\n Go ahead\n Good night you are on Family Time\n\n<$C>  A very well wet night\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  keeping warm though\n\n<$C>  I know some people don't mind it you know\n So I might very well say a very good night to you\n\n<$A>  Yes thank you\n\n<$C> \n I see you have a lawyer on\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Yes yes\n\n<$C>  Very interesting\n\n<$A>  Mhm mhm\n\n<$C>  is what right in\n\nlaw<,> have a man got<,> where his child is\n\nconcern<,><,>    within the\n\nJamaican law what right<,> has a father got any right<,> where him\n\n pickney is concern   because this is a vexation you\n\nknow of society it is one that creates a lot of problems and I think it\n\nis at the base to the reason why men are not encourage to support their\n\nchildren    because we can't \n\nsay/save any rights\n So you tell me about that now Sir\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n Very interesting question\n I'm glad you have

hope\n You're quite right\n I will give you a run down\n\n\n<$C>  what we're waiting for\n\n<$D> \n are new initiatives\n\nafootThere's a new initiative by the Port Authority of Jamaica for example\n\nwhich is very commendable which now will see<,> the entire port particularly\n\nthe container terminal being totally covered by close circuit television\n close circuit television as part of more use of electronic\n\nsecurity systems that includes intrusion detection et cetera which will go a\n\nfar way<,> in acting as a deterrent\n It's also intended as you know electronic security measures to be a\n\ntool   an investigative tool for police but I'm not sure\n We're again hoping that this tool will again assist them to succeed\n\nwhere they've failed totally over the last I don't know how many years\n\n\njust set up uh an advisory committee to look at all the security systems and\n\nprocedures at Port Bustamante and it's being chaired by the president of the\n\nshipping association of Jamaica\n It includes personnel from the agency the shipping lines wharf\n\ncompanies and the port authority as well\n That's two excellent initiatives\n There's also a third which came into place\n\n is about three months ago where\n\nwe made a deputation very high level went to meet with the Prime minister\n\nthen the minister of security then the commissioner of police which resulted\n\nin a very positive move\n The commissioner hand- picked a select team of special\n\ninvestigators and he\n they\n\nare<,,>  their sole   \n\nresponsibility is to investigate all   narcotic signs at Port\n\nBustamante\n\n\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n\n<$C>  Yes\n\n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  Superintendent Williams a part of\n\nthat\n\n<$D>  Uh I\n No no he's not\n Superintendent in\n\ncharge of narcotics in Jamaica\n This is a select team to investigate\n problems we had in the past you know on\n\n   my major complaint was that less than one percent\n\nof all fines result in   investigations lead into conviction and\n\narrest   now <unclear> word</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  and that was the point that\n\nwhich we thought we would talk to you again because  we heard of this very dramatic fine\n\n<$D>  Which one\n\n<$C>  Uh the one the day before yesterday the one uh down in in uh\n\nI think in Westmoreland<,> and we were wondering aloud whether\n\nyou know these fines ever result in any conviction right<,>\n Ah\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D>  No no they never do\n They never ever do\n in fact you know\n\nwhen we had this major issue<,> last month and we men we went to\n\nWashington  ,  I mentioned the customs<,>\n demands the customs made of\n\nus because we went to a long meeting and certain requirements were made of\n\neach part what the customs is gonna do what the line is gonna do what the\n\nsecurity is gonna do and what we as an industry<,> in Jamaica is\n\ngonna do\n And one of the main things that we're pushing for is that we'll\n\nuse whatever means we have  to ensure that the national security in\n\nJamaica improves their investigation  leading to arrest conviction and\n\nimprisonment again\n it's it is no longer a local\n\nissue<,> and uhm there are several other matters we agreed on at\n\nthis meeting in Washington\n\n\nbecause I've been on the port for some time<,> and I did\n\ndetective inspector in charge of  New Portras\n\nPolice<,> actually reported a successful investigation\n\nleading to a guilty plea and<,> uhm the judge ordered him to repay the stolen\n\nstuff\n theft\n\nnot a narcotic<,>\n fact I am still not haven't\n\nfully overcome the shock yet\n But there was a success and this we haven't had for many years\n In fact this case this detective inspector is doing some new\n\nprogress<,> happened before he came there<,>\n\nand he came and he took it and he has been successful\n will is not\n\nthere\n However let me tell you this\n Let me tell you and this is very important\n decided we as a private\n\nsector we as the people

you\n\nknow even now while I speak they're still looking at  <- > indicting\n\n indicting other persons\n So narcotics investigations can be very lengthy\n What I'll say is that uhm the narcotics

serious\n\norganised crime\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Mhm\n assume that the guns are linked to\n\nthe drugs uh at any rate the way in which the guns come in\n is\n\nthat    a reasonable

with\n\nhere<,>\n were on the\n\nlist<,>\n Uhm the same boats that transport the drugs to Jamaica you know by\n\nthat methodology uhm sometimes you know    will\n\nleave guns here\n You have to realise that I recall rather that a lot of piracy goes\n\non on the seas<,>\n\n\nsometimes the guns are uhm a part of the shipment not to commit criminal acts\n\nin that sense   but in terms that the

what\n\nsort of prevented us from doing it ourselves all this time\n\n\n<$B>  talking with the commissioner of police an\n\nextended interview this morning\n Commissioner\n\n<$A>  Yes sir\n\n<$B>  just noting that the\n\nU S ambassador Sue Cobb yesterday announced a thirteen million dollar package\n\nof assistance for surveillance equipment    and I\n\nwas just wondering aloud uhm you know    just\n\nhow far that would go and if it will go far I mean what has been the problem\n I mean this seems to me that surveillance of things coming in at\n\nour ports I mean    both the issue of the coast\n\nguard\n eighteen million dollars on our sort\n\nof supplementary tourism uh campaign\n But we have known for years that drugs and guns are the source of a\n\nlot of the problems    we're trying to\n\ncure with these campaigns\n I just wondered that you know what's your assessment of the worth\n\nof these thirteen million dollars and how far it will go\n\n<$A> \n\n<,>  uhm I imagine that    the Minister of\n\nNational Security will<,> you know inform us you know in due\n\ncourse<,>\n But uhm listening to the ambassador she didn't mention things like\n\n iron scan<,> uhm for the airports<,> uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  is a computerised\n\nuhm piece of equipment that allows    the security\n\npeople out there to swab packages and stuff uhm and to have it analysed on\n\nspot right away\n see it you experience it\n\nwhen you go through airports worldwide now<,> uhm they will swab\n\nthe handle of your attaché case  ,  or your handbag\n\nwhatever it is and uhm you know so    it's an\n\ninstant test\n But I do know that there are portable uhm equipment like that that\n\nwe may be able to put on our marine boats<,> uhm so that when we\n\nstop fishermen out in    the waters we can you know\n\ndo a swab out there and determine whether or not they have been handling\n\ndrugs<,>\n And we could put them you know on initiatives like the one we're\n\nhaving now where we would be stopping and checking vehicles for drugs and\n\nguns and wanted persons<,>\n You could also use them there if the other portable types\n\n<unclear> word(s)</unclear>\n I would need to know some more about that\n But also recall that a lot of this will go into training and I\n\nsuspect with some of the training effort that the relevant equipment would\n\nalso complement the package\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  mentioned uh there was\n\na meeting between the Prime Minister yourself the head of the J D F at the\n\nsort of point of crescendo in the recent violence and didn't get a lot of\n\nattention in the press\n\n\nthere is now going to be a new sort of uh what operational model\n You want to talk to us a little bit about that commissioner\n\n<$A>  Well since uhm Saturday afternoon we have commenced a new\n\ninitiative uhm and for a limited period at a very intense presence on the\n\nroad and that presence and I should call it    an\n\neffective presence and I'll explain later<,>\n\n\n  I would just say from the entire intelligence\n\ncommunities that operates in Jamaica now\n part of that was\n\ndependent on the numbers and you know    we\n\nwere not able  <- > to  to do something like this\n\nprimarily because of the shortages\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Shortages of what\n\n<$A>  they're short of bodies\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  let's get\n\nclear\n\n<$A>  you know we have an establishment of eight\n\nthousand five hundred and we have always uhm been short of an average of\n\ntwelve hundred persons at the<,> uhm due to resignations retirements\n\ndismissals and due to a low uh recruitment flow\n\n<$B>  Low recruitment flow\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$B> \n\n opportunities\n\n<$C>  obvious reasons\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\ncontinually repeat that we are not short of applicants<,> but we\n\nare short of our good applicantsbecause I'm determined that this\n\ntime around<,> we're not going to go for numbers merely to fill\n\nplaces but you know    we want to ensure that we\n\nstart on the right foot\n So we are spending a lot of time and energy into vetting the\n\napplicants to ensure that we get a good quality to start with\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$D>  So so uhm uh commissioner\n\n<$C> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n Good morning yeah\n\n<$D>  Uhm so the numbers have been made up uhm by the call out of\n\nthe reserve\n\n<$A>  It's definitely so yes\n And we have also called out uhm our members who are working in\n\noffices generally\n numbers have not been\n\nincreased merely by the presence of the soldiers or the call out of the\n\nsoldiers\n But you know we have a programme that normally we would activate\n\nin the Christmas period<,> and we went to that programme early this\n\ntime

things    in the future\n\nfor people because my sister husband died and their kids couldn't inherit\n\nanything because administrator general was saying the father's name was not\n\n  on the birth

\n\nadvice to politicians in a situation like this and perhaps we should invite\n\nthe rest of the panel to join us at this point\n tell me are you\n\nalso of the view that    the <- > election  elections in\n\nJamaica<,> are characterised one by violence and that because of\n\nthat you are not as comfortable to express yourself as a young person\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D>  that\n\nthat uhm  that violence in itself<,> becomes a\n\nsource    of<,>\n\ndestruction<,> and uhm<,> points one you know the\n\ndirection<,>    from going\n\ntowards it<,>\n politics in\n\nthis country    as it's practiced and uhm<,>\n\nas it's practiced by the supporters themselves<,>    is one of<,> a violent nature<,>\n\n we also must\n\nrealise    that us as young people that we\n\npossess the ability to change all of this<,> and that we can\n\nbecome that force<,> that power force   \n\nto create the change    in the nature    of our politics\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n uh LamoreWhat are some of the ways do you think that a young\n\nperson and here how are we defining young\n\n\n is uh that generation of persons below the age thirty<,> eligible\n\n   to vote in Jamaica<,>\n\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D>  toward thirty-two\n\nthereabouts<,>\n Yes yes yes\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Alright\n So how are some of the ways that young persons can or young\n\nJamaicans<,> can contribute to the uhm lessening of the violence\n\nfor example in our    elections in Jamaica or\n\nthe political system  \n\n\n this election process\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\nwe must unite    as young\n\npeople<,> and    we have to uhm\n\nembark upon some sort of education programme<,> educating the\n\nyoung people like ourselves    and those who are\n\na bit older\n\n\nthe  the purpose    of politics itself\n\nthat politics should serve to enhance the life of everybody<,>\n\nand not    to kill  \n\n and    to hurt  \n\n and all these things<,>\n uhm what is necessary is\n\nthat us as young people if we the intellectuals if we can put forward some\n\nprogrammes if we can raise the young people  , who are not\n\n   uhm as<,> as\n\ninformed   uh  of how they're going to go through\n\nbettering education in Jamaica\n\n taking a lot of care about\n\nthat\n Uhm the other party is just putting out a general thing where I\n\nthink uhm you know that's appealing to the more uninformed set of people in\n\nJamaica\n Now I think this is working for that party it is breaking up some\n\nvotes and it is you know increasing    their\n\npercentage support in the polls<,> because    the average    Jamaican\n\nhears<,> free education\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>

an issue but  \n\n the question is it workable is it feasible\n Yes it is feasible\n It demands\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  What specific issue do you think is

people like yourselves   would want to see in so far as\n\nthis free education go but<,> you know what part of this free education thing\n\ndo you think is workable as compared to the parts that are not\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D>  Ha\n when the\n\ngovernment itself    takes the\n\nresponsibility from    the\n\nparents<,> and provides   \n\nthe students<,> provides the children<,> with uhm<,> uh\n\nuh   uhm  a<,> classroom space provides them    with the equipment with which to work while\n\nnot asking them for any financial uhm<,> uhm<,> support<,>\n uh uhm takes\n\nitself<,>\n have a\n\nbudget<,> and when that cost is added<,> and when that cost \n\n uhm  goes into the\n\nbudget<,>    and is coming from\n\nthe budget it then    reduces  <,>  your

do you believe that this free education uh issue\n\nthat people have in their    manifesto will\n\nwork\n\n<$C> \n\nthat they would want something that's free<,> for it    to work it has to be paid for and that is what most people\n\ndo not realise\n that resource or that funding\n\nhas to come from somewhere<,>\n Where this is coming from I guess these politicians have the idea\n But what I think is that\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  But don't you think though that the politicians have a right\n\nuh if not a responsibility to explain to the Jamaican electorate  \n\nwhere the

you\n\ncatch only<,> four you know\n\n<$A>  they're\n\nsending more people as in    the drug\n\nbarons et cetera for want of a better  term sending more couriers so\n\nthat if some are caught at least

she had some scar\n She said that during the nineteen eighty elections she was alone\n\nwith her sister<,> and the house was set ablaze and she got burned\n And she has the scars and she said she went to England once to stay\n\nwith some relatives but she wasn't treated that well and she was on the\n\nstreet and she met a lady\n And they became friends and she said that she came back and the\n\nlady<,> called her up one day and said  Like you'll I know\n\nsomebody that<,> we could set you on to so that you could come up<,> and do a\n\nplastic surgery in order to get yourself back together\n And with that in mind she offered to accept and she got caught\n and she left them with somebody and uh when\n\nshe got caught<,> her main concern were the children\n So I said she said that she's going to go into the court and said\n\n I know that I'm wrong and I shouldn't have done it but I was\n\ndesperate<,> and<,> I'm just gonna make up my mind to do the term\n\n<$C>  Detective

that<,> the females<,> could\n\ndo it<,> one of two ways<,>\n insert it\n\n<$C> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$C>  Insert it where\n\n<$B>  the vagina\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n\nyou know\n\n\nthe rectum

same process\n put the\n\nthing up you know up into the vagina and they would walk around with it for a\n\nlittle while to get themselves accustom to it   \n\nand then at    another time they just\n\nget it out and they'll put it there again and get accustom to  \n\nit<,> and then the next time by the time they're ready to leave    the vagina would be so accommodating  \n\n to the thing that you know they will feel comfortable with it\n\nthis time  , uh\n\n<$D> \n\n<$?> \n\n<$?> \n\n<$A>  they reached England they give birth to\n\nthe drugs\n\n<$C> \n\n<$B> \n\n\n  to those whose

have    to give it  ,  \n\n a certain amount of time within    the stomach    in the\n\nsame amount of time that you would travel to England\n\n\n cause once these guys give it to you now you can't

accepted\n go to\n\nEngland\n\n<$D> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  So we have established at this point that people do it because\n\nthey're desperate despite what social uhm niche in the\n\nsociety<,>   status

importance of the greater\n\nuhm de-brutalization    if I might coin a\n\nword<,> of the Jamaican societyBecause obviously we've gotten\n\ntoo accustomed to violent language and violent action\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Violent language and action\n\n<$A>  is a little bit\n\nif I might you know without being unkind a little bit of an\n\namateurism\n\n\na  have appeared amateurish in a couple of instances\n\nrecently you know    the tragic death of the\n\ntwo policemen at South Parade    the man taking a\n\nfirearm from a policeman the other day on Waltham Park Road and so on\n Questions have I suppose legitimately been raised as to whether\n\nthe police is sophisticated enough in terms of   \n\nyou know its training<,> to handle the kind of criminal\n\nmind-set that is out there<,> that in fact the ready resort to\n\nbrutish violence on the part of the police   has compromised its\n\ncapacity to be efficient\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  you\n\nknow they need far more training\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  But another truth is that there has been a vast improvement\n\nin the training\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  And also there has been a certain focus which is this that\n\nuhm the persons for example at the ranks    of those\n\nwho got murdered brutally the other day are the persons who are really out\n\nthere on the street\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  They are the ones confronting the hostilities\n They are the ones confronting the violent criminals\n They are the ones who have to deal with street crime\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  And so that what has happened now is that there has been an\n\nemphasis a focus on the training for those persons\n\n\nto work should lessen because certainly the steps are being taken to\n\nensure that they are properly equipped they're properly trained to be able to\n\ncarry out    thejob\n\n\n well to say it quite openly uhm more focus once on the higher\n\nrankswho are not the ones who for the most part<,>\n\nare out there in the streets<,>so there has been a\n\nredirection of the focus although there is still the training being given for\n\nthe higher ranks but for the purposes of management for the purposes of\n\nsupervision\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\none of the  one of the ways in which you are responding to the\n\npresent crisis is by<,> increasing the amount of  \n\n training available to the lower ranks\n\n<$B>  believe you me training\n\nis the key\n If we don't train people properly they cannot behave efficiently\n\nact efficiently and respond in the type of way that is professional\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  is the answer and I know that there are\n\npersons in the society who are here asking well we want the results now\n The fact is that if we just keep on with the now then we will\n\nnever train the persons properly and down the road we are going to be    confronted with the same problems so that whilst\n\nthere is    a reaction to the now there must also be\n\nin place the training for the medium and long-term benefits<,> and\n\nthis is what we're doing\n\n<$A>  We\n\n<$A>  in\n\nthe past you and I have had discussion about the    the increased use of\n\ntechnology in terms of computer and so on<,> by the police\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A> now talk about training and\n\nso on\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A>  One of the things that many persons have asked about is could\n\nthere be a kind of amnesty and general social appeal to bringing all the\n\nweapons of violence the guns the knives and perhaps uh uh you know uh uh uh I\n\ndon't know an amnesty<,>\n Uhm has any serious thought been given to something like this\n\n<$B>  Serious\n\n<$A> \n\n too much of it \n\n<$B>  thought was given to it\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  other occcasions and uhm\n\nthe overwhelming advice was that\n Look when amnesties are declared you actually find that some old\n\nrusty guns are brought in that really there is no response from those who\n\npossess the deadly weapons\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  And so that nothing positive comes out of it\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  And so that uhm to date we have really not declared an\n\namnesty\n It is not because it has not been considered\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  advice\n\nthat has been received and the analysis of what has happened elsewhere and\n\nalso here    in the past\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$B>  we\n\nwould want them to work\n\n<$A>  part of\n\nthe reason though they have not worked is because uh you know one doesn't\n\nwant to speak too confidently is that there has not been perceived a\n\nsingle-mindedness\n Now may I give you an example which I think though I can't give\n\n   my source it's somewhat that documented or can be\n\nsubstantiated<,>\n couple of nights ago or maybe last\n\nnight even there was    a raid in Franklyn Town or the\n\nRollington Town area an area of Eastern Kingston in which there has been some\n\ncriminal activity<,> and a lot of shooting<,>\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A>  night before that I had\n\nheard through my sources that there was going to be just such a thing and\n\nthat the people at the top were advised of it<,>   \n\nyou see\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A> \n\nbe out of the area at the time\n\n<$B>  When you say the people at the top right\n\n<$A>  dons and the\n\nnext to the dons<,>    you\n\nknowSo that in fact those who are detained are for the most part fryers\n\nbecause word has come obviously and almost inevitably<,> through\n\nthe police ranks<,> that this was going to take place and so\n\ntake steps to protect yourself now   even\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  we have had some difficulty with\n\nconfidentiality  ,  and leaks have occurred because there are\n\nconnections  ,  and this has on many occasions compromised\n\nthe operation uh mounted by the security forces\n here again that\n\none has to really work uhm on being able to deploy the forces    on the sort of need- to-know basis you know\n\n\nand  and get it down to a real scientific point  ,\n\n uhm but there has been this leak    the\n\nbetrayal of confidence\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nparti  it's particularly unfortunate in this instance\n\nbecause this is one of the communities which one could call a P N P community\n\n ,  So it'd almost smack of political interference  \n\n<,> at that level\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n  I want to state again  ,     on this programme I think I have stated it on your\n\nprogramme  ,  in the past<,> but this is worth repeating eh\n\nbelieve you me hourly  ,  There is no political interference\n\nin the operations of the security forces\n They are free to go wherever they want to whenever they want to\n\nand to detain charge arrest or otherwise deal with whomsoever  ,\n\n\n They're in pursuit of criminals\n We're not in pursuit of persons with political labels\n As far as I am concerned I don't see political labels on\n\ncriminals\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Hmhm\n\n<$B>  You follow me\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  uhm I have heard there was\n\nan article recently in the  Wiley daily papers in which it was saying\n\nthat some policemen are saying that they know who the dons are\n They know who the criminals are but their hands are tied\n I want them to come out go to the churchmen and tell them who\n\ntying their hand\n Go to the ombudsman and tell them who tying their hand\n Tell the country\n Come on these programmes\n Call names\n Tell me\n Since that they won't tell me because they haven't told tell me\n\nwhich politician is interfering\n Tell me which don they want and they know how to get and can't\n\nget because they are prevented   uhm  by\n\npolitician", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

were\n\nin their sort of seventies\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$B>  You had any possible reservations\n You would ask for medical certificates\n But this has become more the norm in recent years\n certain companies and\n\n   I think of one specifically have started actually\n\ncutting off cover for uhm drivers when they reach a certain age\n\n<$A>  What age is that sir\n\n<$B>  Uhm well in this particular case it was eighty\n\n<$A>  Eighty\n\n<$B>  But I don't know of course as you know it's a free market and\n\nwe have sixteen companies and each one has their own rules but  \n\n<unclear>

for the medical examination\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  we all\n\nget older there is going to be    a<,> slight\n\ndeterioration that varies between, individuals\n this company that started cutting off\n\nat<,> age eighty told me that they had been experiencing in the last year or\n\ntwo a very considerable increase in the number of elderly people who were\n\nhaving accidents that is weighted of course for the number that are on their\n\nbooks\n\n<$A>  Uh hu\n\n<$B>  I said that my impression had been for years that these were\n\nnot on a new hazard on Dial's own books but I went and checked with my claims\n\ndepartment only to find that in the last year or two there has been quite an\n\nincrease in this and that the usual<,> uh    the\n\nmost common form of accident involving elderly people seems to be when they\n\ncome to a stop light and they tend to misjudge cars coming on the main and\n\ncome out\n We have had quite a few of those\n\n<$A>  stop\n\nsign\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Uh

please\n\n<$C>  Okay\n\n<$A>  uhm but why should this be happening in\n\nthe last year or two\n\n<$B>  I don't know\n may be\n\n largely a perception\n I mean uh this is something that very few of us if any had on our\n\ncomputers before\n\n\n<- > your  your overall portfolio  , \n But as a perception there definitely have been more\n I have been trying to think of possible reasons why this could

think of reasons for this\n But quite apart from that I think that there's a matter of\n\nprotection    of the motor insurance account\n\nof the individual company to the policy holder him or herself<,> and to the\n\ngeneral public\n\n\n considerations that insurance companies feel\n It's just one of several\n mean there are others that in relation to younger\n\ndrivers    to  <- >

maybe it is a    totally false\n\nimpression<,> that    asa\n\nproportion    of total accidents the\n\naccidents involving these older people<,> the let us say sixty and over<,>\n\nthat    there would be<,>   \n\nweighted    for their proportion among\n\nthe totality of drivers<,> that you would find more accidents\n\noccurring among younger drivers than you would find among<,> those old people\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  more accidents but more serious\n\naccidents<,> occurring    in the let us say the\n\nunder twenty-five age group<,> than you would find in the over\n\nsixty age group\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  of course\n\nunderriding measures for those lower-age groups as well\n It doesn't mean to say that one shouldn't also have similar\n\nmeasures at the higher end of the scale\n I mean if we all live long enough there must come a time when our\n\nvision    and<,> uhm our hearing uh almost I should\n\nthink maybe the vast majority of us are going to start deteriorating and I\n\nthink this is just a matter of a double-check\n\n<$A>  Uh hu\n\n<$B>  uh the\n\nindustry's always being criticized for not taking steps to do anything about\n\nuhm avoiding accidents and reducing the accident rate\n In fact this is really not the case\n do an immense amount\n practically no\n\nmeasure that we ever take that doesn't produce controversy with one group or\n\nanother\n This happens to be one of them\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  see your point\n is reasonable for you to know\n\nwhat risk you're undertaking\n\n<$B>  also\n\nin the protection of the public as well\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nquite near to that age group myself and\n\n<$B>  Yes so am I\n\n<$A> \n\nmeas  taking measures    to\n\nreduce the rate of   accidents  \n\n is there any study done in Jamaica<,> uh<,> any data

{'text': "<$A>  Hi\n This is Conversations\n\n As you are aware Conversations is our attempt here at Radio Mona to\n\nintroduce you to graduates and faculty members of the institution<,> and just\n\nto highlight some of the contributions that they make nationally regionally\n\nand in a number of cases globally\n This morning our guest is Public Relations Officer researcher\n\nnational environmental and planning agency NEPA for those of you in a hurry\n Her name is Ruthlyn Elizabeth Johnson\n Ruthlyn welcome to Conversations\n\n<$B> \n I was the Public Relations Officer at the national environmental and\n\nplanning agency when I sent in the C V I did indicate but apparently you were\n\nnot informed that<,> currently I'm the Corporate Communication Officer of the\n\nJamaica Public Service Company\n\n<$A>  Okay\n Well how's that going\n\n<$B> It has been going quite well\n I joined J P S Co in October and it has been a very challenging but\n\nvery dynamic and exciting environment\n I mean I never fathom that there could be so much work at the\n\nJamaica Public Service Company but there really is\n\n<$A>  uhm and uh did\n\n   the organization you work\n\nfor     what's the \n\ngreatest challenge that you find yourself facing on a daily basis\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Okay\n\n\n my portfolio is customer education\n\n\nthere are  there're many issues that I had with J P S Co\n\nbefore I worked there\n And it means that members of the public they also have many issues\n\nwith J P S Co\n Now to get people to understand the business of the Jamaica Public\n\nService Company and to get them to realize that some of   \n\nthe problems that do exist yes<,> they are the fault of the company\n\nand some of them we have no control over is really a challenge\n And customers call constantly\n Even though I don't work in customer service I get numerous calls\n\nfrom members of the public quarrelling with the company\n to really inform people about\n\nwhat are their responsibilities    as against what\n\nare the responsibilities of the company presents a challenge a major\n\nchallenge\n\n<$A>  Now what do you understand now about the company that you\n\ndidn't understand prior to joining\n\n<$B>  that the Jamaica Public\n\nService Company has many challenges in house for example there's a lack of\n\nresources in terms of basic equipment for example trucks to go out<,> out\n\nthere on the streets\n They attend to problems that people might have let's say a\n\nstreetlight is not working in my area\n uhm\n\noperations people at JPSCo or enough resources in terms of    physical bodies and trucks equipment that kind of\n\nthing for people to be out there to attend to all the street lights that need\n\nto be fixed on every street in Jamaica\n So you might find that you call us today and say my street light is\n\nnot working\n I want to have it fixed\n But we have quite a list quite a number of streetlights to be fixed\n\nand so we're doing them systematically but of course you're upset because\n\nyour light needs to be fixed now    the area in front of\n\nyour house is in darkness and you want it fixed now\n\n<$A>  Mmh\n\n<$B>  So I recognize now some of the challenges that the company has\n\nto face\n\n<$A>  not\n\nsaying I'm concerned about   or would be concerned\n\nabout uh a streetlight but I'm  really/ready\n\nmore concerned about my own personal\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  that is so high\n before you\n\nwent there\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  I never had a problem with my consumption\n No not at all\n\n<$A>  never felt your\n\nbill was too high\n\n<$B>  No\n I've never felt that\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  No\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  apart from your streetlight you didn't have any\n\nother problems at all with them\n\n<$B>  power outages\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\noutages but now I recognize why\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n I never heard a maintenance<,> outage being advertised\n And now I'm responsible for doing them\n And I don't know I never heard them before where they actually\n\ninform the public that on<,> Thursday June twenty-six we're going to be\n\ncarrying out scheduled maintenance outage in whatever area\n I never used to hear them before\n I don't know why\n\n<$A>  apart\n\nfrom street light I mean what else do consumers complain about mostly\n\n<$B>  They complain about their bills\n\n\n complaint\n\n<$A>  being what\n\n<$B>  bills too being too high\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mmh\n\n<$B>  Or they don't get their bills on time\n They get their bills way past the due dates\n general way\n\nthat uhm some of    the J P S Co<,> personal treat\n\nthem    when they meet them in their homes\n They complain about the meter readers\n They complain about their meters not being read\n stand too far from\n\nthe meters when they're reading them<,>\n They complain about many things\n my\n\nconsumption is way too high\n\n\n<$A>  in a no win\n\nsituation\n\n<$B>  I would\n\nnot say so\n It's difficult but it's not a no win\n I think I can reach quite a few people over time\n J P S Co and they've gotten to\n\nme and they're so angry when they finally get to me\n And I listen to them and I let them vent and then I try my best to\n\nhelp them and trust me usually when I inform some of them of what is it that\n\nthey should be doing I end up with a happy customer at the end   of the\n\ncall\n\n<$A>  want\n\nour conversation to be about the J PS Co\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  so it may be\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  really\n\nwould like to look at is Public Relations which is something that you\n\nspecialise in\n\n<$B>  Uhu\n\n<$A>  when you when\n\nyou<,,>  is it about us and them or trying to  \n\n  what is    your primary\n\nfocus as a<,> Public Relations  <- >   Officer\n What's your primary focus\n\n<$B>  My primary focus in the capacity that I operate in now is\n\nreally to inform customers about the company the operations of the company\n\nand to get them to understand what are their responsibilities to the\n\ncompany<,> because\n\n<$A>  Where are your loyalties\n\n<$B>  Where my loyalties lie\n I think my loyalties lie both with the company and with the\n\ncustomers\n\n<$A>  How can you do that at the same time honestly\n\n<$B>  Uh\n\n<$A>  You can't go east and west at the same time I mean\n\n<$B>  necessarily\n\nthink Michael that it's a case of trying    to tear\n\nmyself between two sets    of people because<,> I\n\nconsider that the company serves the customer so there's no way that    we should be separate and apart without them we don't\n\nexist and without us they don't exist\n So because of that I'm merely trying to bridge the gap between\n\ngetting these    two sets of people to\n\ncome together and    to operate\n\nin harmony\n I don't\n\nfeel like I'm being torn apart\n go to the customers with the information that they should get\n\nand I ensure that they're informed I try to keep them informed I try to keep\n\nthem on top of things and at the same time well that's the mandate    that the company gives me that I should keep the\n\ncustomers informed so I don't feel like I'm doing anything\n I really don't feel like I'm being stretched\n\n<$A>  a split decision a\n\ndecision that you have to you know both arguments are good and you know\n\ncompany is making a good argument   and the customer is making a\n\ngood   argument you have to make a final decision\n do you make final decisions\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  I don't make the final decisions\n\n<$A>  Oh you don't\n\n<$B>  Cause I'm not the manager\n\n<$A> \n\nwhat's your role\n Do you get a chance to influence the process one way or another\n\n<$B> \n\ngetting as much information as possible from the customer<,> and by\n\n<$A>  You ever rule in favour of the customer\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B> \n For example a lot of people don't think that customers win with\n\nthis monopoly company\n But is not necessarily true\n I remember a customer once came to us and she was concerned that\n\nher bill was way too high\n saw it she faxed me some\n\ncopies and when I saw it I thought something   \n\nlooked very strange\n intense investigation I discovered that yes\n\n   there was some errors in fact it was a meter\n\nreading error\n she\n\nwas reimbursed quite a bit of money\n\n<$A> \n\n\nthe errors in reading meters I mean is that\n\n<$B>  No I've not seen many errors in reading meters\n of the time\n\nMichael people actually\n\n<$A>  enough to make you concerned that you\n\nknow that this is a real challenge   for the company\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nnot in the meter reading  , department\n\n<$A>  challenges\n\n<$B>  I've seen challenges in terms of the treatment that customers\n\nget from sometimes from our customer service personnel which causes me the\n\nconcern\n\n<$A>  Okay\n Incidentally this is Conversations\n I'm Michael Anthony Cuffe\n Our guest is Ruthlyn Johnson and uhm we are just looking at her\n\nrole as uhm the  <- > Public Relations Officer at the<,>\n\nCorporate Communications     Corporate\n\nCommunications Officer at J P S Co\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  role\n\nof what you do in a general sense Ruthlyn because  Public Relations\n\nreally    is a very wide uhm  \n\n and diverse field\n Is it not\n\n<$B>  Yes it is\n\n<$A>  Yah\n Ah what are the different branches cause what you do now is just\n\none branch of it but what are some of the other areas that uhm you know one\n\n   would find themselves working in\n\n<$B>  specifically\n\nfor some people they might find themselves operating   \n\nin a situation where  <- > their  their focus is on\n\nimage building building the image of a company which is I think    one of the hardest areas of Public\n\nRelations to find yourself in because is not easy to get to change people's\n\nmindset about something when they've already convinced themselves probably\n\nbased on evidence or probably just information from other people that this\n\nthing is this way and is now your job to go there and change that image that\n\nthey have in their minds\n one area\n uhm education\n\nthe whole thing of it's almost like public relations slash public education\n\nwhere you're really informing people\n Then there's the other aspect where you actually go out and do\n\ncommunity work community service kind of thing  that's another\n\naspect    of Public Relations getting into\n\ncommunities and working with people\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  organisation and uhm that also\n\naligns itself  <- > with  with helping people the whole\n\nthing of that philanthropic area where    you give\n\nstuff you constantly you give to the benefits the charges and you take care\n\nof people now    that's the nice side\n\nthat's the side that a lot of people like because you always get a good\n\nfeeling coming out of that and people always appreciate what you do but\n\nPublic Relations is\n\n<$A>  Is it applicable in politics\n\n<$B>  If Public Relations are applicable in politics\n\n\n<$A>  role does it\n\nplay\n\n<$B>  It plays a role in there's the education aspect and there is\n\n   the philanthropic side\n Of course sometimes

Norman Manley Law\n\nSchool in September are finding that they have to be waiting the convenience\n\nand pleasure<,> of the Chief Justice<,> for admission to the bar<,>\n any High Court Judge may call a young\n\nattorney to the bar<,>\n has stipulated that while he is Chief Justice\n\nhe wishes to call all new attorneys to the bar<,>\n\n\nthat are being admitted to the profession<,> and that this is a convenient\n\nway to achieve this objective<,>\n Graduates are complaining that this approach creates a difficulty\n\nas<,> given the Chief Justice's schedule<,> it is often difficult to fit\n\nin<,> all the graduates in the shortest possible time<,>\n and the\n\nfirst batch of graduates had to wait until the end of November<,> before a\n\nconvenient date could be found for them<,>\n Graduates are also complaining that some law firms do not pay new\n\nrecruits their full salary<,> until they are called to the bar<,> and so the\n\ndelay occasioned by the Chief Justice's stipulation<,> could result in their\n\nnot receiving full remuneration<,>\n of the Jamaican\n\nBar Association<,>\n\n\npress release on the anti-corruption bill<,> but you know in this\n\nmatter\n Morning Mr Jones\n\n<$C>  Good morning gentlemen\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  when\n\nwe  when we get a man of your elevated status we have to make\n\nopportunity in to interconnect\nI seen it here in Insight\n\nwithout insight this morning about the uhm\n stipulation\n I want to be fair to the Chief Justice\n which says that he's the\n\nperson    to have them admitted to\n\nthe bar<,> and apparently has caused them a lot of inconvenience because \n\n  his schedule is so busy\n That's up to him\n\n\nthan normal although other judges are apparently available to do

happens is that the application of somebody who\n\nhas gone through    the process of getting what is\n\nknown as a legal education certificate<,> which is your\n\nprofessional degree if I could call   it that\n Uhm you have to make an application to the Supreme Court\n That application has to be heard and an order is made by the Court\n\nauthorizing you to become an attorney-at-law uh and to sign

is\n\nrequired   to do<,>\n\n\nin block you know<,> so that I mean the ceremony that\n\nwas held a couple of weeks ago<,> uhm I think was the better\n\npart of seventy-five uh lawyers which is I think

very\n\nwell be that    the Chief Justice sees it as an\n\nopportunity also to welcome   uhm<,> you know new members to the\n\nprofession\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  uh the\n\ncourt<,> uhm you know admonishes the new   uh new\n\napplicants and encourages them as to standards and so on\n may be that from an\n\nadministrative point of view it's something the Chief

the uhm  ,  no\n\n\nI don't know if they would particularly care whether it's a\n\nshort-term measure or not<,>\n I have some\n\nconcerns as to what would now make them begin to pay\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  you see Mr Hay\n The thing is this\n\n\nhelm    at   J P S Co<,> uhm    there was a metre relocation programme<,>\n\nwhere metres were put in\n You remember the centralized locations where metre readers could\n\n  go and so and so and so forth to make this whole process\n\nuhm<,> you know ehe easier  <- > to to  to\n\n treat this<,>\n really don't understand\n\nthe logic now that is being applied<,>\n Because it seems to me it's not that you can't get the readings\n\nnow whereas certain men are refusing to pay<,>\n uh\n\naverage the consumption for the community and  \n\n with    an additional <unclear> several-\n\nwords</unclear>\n If you pay the average consumption we give you back some of the\n\nmoney\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  Hm you see uhm\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  they\n\nuhm really even with the relocated metres that the metre readers cannot go\n\ninto these areas   to read the metres<,>\n what we\n\nare discussing with them<,> as uh what alternatives there would be\n\nand when I therefore speak of the uhm short to medium term<,> it\n\nwould be really applying different<,> approaches to some extent uhm looking\n\nalso at different technologies<,> that could be applied where\n\nuhm the metres could be read<,> and disconnected uhm\n\nsafely<,> if the payments are not made   that they\n\nthat therefore should be the case for all consumers\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$C>  Uhm but these could not be implemented immediately and so if\n\nwe appear to be sitting on the fence it is because we appreciate<,>    the position that J P S is in that   they\n\nreally have to do something<,> to begin\n\ncollecting<,> and also for the people in these communities to\n\nbegin to recognize that they have a responsibility to pay for what  \n\nthey're consuming\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n\n<$A>  There have been a number of fires reported over the weekend\n\nand in every single case the argument has been the same low water pressure\n\nand no water\n I I mean do you have a view on\n\nthis\n What's happening\n\n<$B> \n\nthe case that is something I would have to check into\n\n<$A>  Just a minute\n Three reports that there came on the media between Friday and and\n\nSunday  I'd say is the same argument low water pressure and no water\n\n<$B>  Uhm well one got be very careful how one determines uh low\n\nwater pressure\n different areas the water\n\npressure varies and therefore you will find that for example uh let us say in\n\nNew Kingston for example\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$B>  Right you'll find that the water pressure is not as high as\n\nit is on the industrial belt along Spanish Town Road\n\n<$C>  Yes\n\n<$B> \n\nfire  fire fighters might be expecting the same kind or\n\nthe same level of pressure in New Kingston as they would have been accustomed\n\nto    on that strip out there and uhm that that\n\ndefinitely would not have been the case and therefore they would always say\n\nthat the water pressure is   low\n instances where there is no water I really cannot speak to\n\nthat because I wasn't aware of it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  I am assuming that the fire fighters are aware of this issue\n\nthat sometimes the water pressure might be different in different areas since\n\nthey work with water almost by definition\n\n<$B>  Steven it is I want to tell you that even though that that\n\nought to be the case it happens so very often that uhm you know it will make\n\nyou wonder\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  know what fascinates me with this\n\nargument uhm that for example with the shops uhm I think there was a three or\n\nfour shops that were that burned down    in some\n\nplace in Saint Mary I believe it was Friday morning it happened and the\n\nargument was that    there was nothing they\n\ncould do I mean they just literally stood by and   watch it\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  And in another case the pressure was low and they claim that\n\nwhat they did was that they just try and contain the fire with it where it\n\nwas and that was that\n\n<$C> \n\nthere  there is no\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  about it and just to say too that\n\nwe have been working very closely    with the\n\nfire service over the years\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$C>  from time\n\nto time do boost water supply uhm to areas where you have fires that are you\n\nknow ablaze\n\n<$B>  Alright\n we are on general topics uhm\n\ncan I ask you for a comment on this the flat rate\n Do you have problems of

yes that has bearing but    the main\n\nthing is more reliable labour\n\n<$A> \n abandoning\n\nit or what\n\n<$B>  is\n\nnot being abandoned<,> you know everything is still in\n\nplace\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Aha\n\n<$B> \n\n with a development that size<,> we cannot just uhm uh\n\n wait on this to come through\n We have made alternative plans at the moment\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  that\n\n<$B>  which uhm I cannot\n\ngo in detail at the moment other than saying\n\n<$A>  A regional development\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A>  does that mean\n\n<$B> uh all sort of commercial\n\nfacilities\n\n<$A>  Aha\n\n<$B>  uhm mainly with\n\nuhm local capital<,>    the project will\n\nalso be offering abroad and uhm we think we can earn a bit of foreign\n\nexchange through that medium\n\n<$A>  Well but could I ask you this\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A>  was to put up a free zone\n\n   factory space\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$A>  and\n\nuhm  and see whether uhm you can attract uhm uh other\n\ninvestors into it\n\n<$B>  whole thing\n\nhas changed  the whole thing has changed uhm since we came up\n\nwith the concept<,>\n uhm according to the foreign\n\nexchange act we could not carry a foreign exchange uhm account\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$B>  or we\n\nsaid to the government<,> we would not need your foreign exchange<,> right<,>\n whatever foreign exchange we earn\n\n<$A>  Would go to the Bank of Jamaica\n\n<$B>  through the\n\nBank of Jamaica to our foreign currency account\n\n<$A>  Yes I see\n\n<$B>  so that we are able to pay our investors pay back our\n\ninvestors in foreign currency without the restriction and going through\n\navailability of foreign exchange\n\n<$A>  But of course that has changed\n You can go\n\n<$B>  it uhm\n\nuh  it's a bit different\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$B>  that uhm uh because\n\nof the reaction of investors in the past\n\n<$A>  Hmhm\n\n<$B> \n\nthe Jamaican labour\n\n<$A>  Aha\n\n<$B>  Uhm they may still have that in their minds\n\n<$A>  Reservations about\n\n<$B>  so you know we would have to even fight\n\nharder today\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$B>  And uhm because of that we would kinda hold off uhm on that\n\nbecause we would find now that we would be

Hello\n\n<$B>  Hello\n\n<$A>  Mr Spaulding\n\n<$B>  Yes\n Good afternoon\n\n<$A>  You're on the air sir uhm\n We would like to speak to you because we been getting a lot of\n\ncallers who are suggesting by implication that Mister Anderson might have had\n\nsome unfair advantage in the system by virtue of being a Member of Parliament\n Would you like to comment on this\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Errol Anderson in respect of this accident\n\n<$B>  Oh I see\n if a person can have an\n\nunfair advantage<,> by people calling in on the call-in programmes and some\n\nof them no doubt politically inspired to be mischievous and a demonstration\n\nis    staged in relation to facts\n\nthey don't know about and that is an unfair advantage\n\n\ndisadvantage\n I think that Anderson has been severely prejudiced by public\n\nopinion<,> because he happens to be a politician<,>\n I think that the world and we in Jamaica in particular will have to\n\nlearn that despite the fact that people may be in public life on the opposite\n\nside of the fence you know they're entitled to justice\n had in my time to deal with applications\n\nregarding people who have been on the opposite side of the political fence no\n\nnames to be called<,> and you have to deal with it\n\ndispassionately\n I've had to deal with applications for instance citizenship where\n\nthe persons had been personally unkind and oppressive to me or members of my\n\nfamily\n But you have to detach that\n Those persons who are doing it would love justice for themselves\n\nand their families and they must let the course of justice    run for Errol Anderson\n or a\n\ngarbage man he is entitled to due process   and due process is\n\nnot enhanced by mischievous calls that are designed to try to intimidate the\n\nprocess\n\n<$A> \n\n$A-laughs\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Uhm\n sought to point out to some callers\n\nthat the presumption of innocence is something that everyone is entitled to\n And what is particularly sad about this is that it is not alleged\n\nthat this gentleman did anything deliberate\n It is alleged that there was an accident and the issue would be\n\nwhether he was grossly negligent   not a\n\n<$B> \n What has happened is that in Jamaica we have very many motor\n\nvehicle accidents\n And I can recall Errol Anderson when he and I were colleagues in\n\nanother<,> area supporting me strongly on the importance of<,> uhm<,> you\n\nknow<,>    this very vital area\n\nbecause of its threat to public uhm life and so on uhm to public safety and\n\nthe lives of individuals\n I don't think that because a person is a\n\npolitician Member of Parliament they should be singled out and that is really\n\nit\n You know we talk about uhm prejudice and unfair advantage\n unfair disadvantage\n And these persons are trying to embark upon a course designed to\n\ncreate an unfair disadvantage by creating in the minds of the persons no\n\ndoubt who'd have to deal with it ultimately eh deal with this in a different\n\nway than you would for John Doe<,>\n Because if you don't we're going to impute some sort of prejudice\n lead\n\nto the person reacting in a way that you'd have a prejudice because that\n\nperson may have to say\n Well we have to show that we are being serious let us take some\n\naction in this against Anderson that we might not take against John Doe\n don't hear people calling in on the\n\nprogrammes calling out about John Doe day by day in the numerous fatal\n\naccidents that we have in Jamaica and    we must\n\ncleanse our hearts and do better than this\n\n<$A>  Alright\n Can I put the arguments on the other side to you now straight up\n\nthe arguments as I've heard\n If anybody else was driving and hit somebody down they would have\n\nfound  in jail the same night charged for it   to\n\n<$B>  I say something\n\n<$A>  What do you say to that\n\n<$B>  practitioner I have numerous\n\ncases<,> uhm in which we have had to go to coroner's inquest because the\n\nnature of the accident<,> and this doesn't differ for anybody's\nand\n\nthen the prejudice\n That's why I'm making the point that the prejudice exists because\n\nif the person name was John Brown and this had happened we would not be\n\nhaving those arguments\n The fact that we're having those arguments imputes not necessarily\n\nthat the course of justice is perverted but that their minds are perverted\n\nand they're speaking to equally pervert the course of justice\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n you said that uhm you have numerous cases in which it is\n\nreferred to the coroner rather than a charge of manslaughter   is\n\nmade<,>\n What could you\n\n\n<$B> <\n#>Yes I mean the administration of uhm Miss Haughton you know\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\ncoroner's court is filled with cases of uhm sudden deaths fatal accidents and\n\nso on filled with it because the circumstances from the investigations that\n\ntake place uhm are such that it is more appropriate for the matter to be\n\ndealt with by a coroner's inquest than for somebody to be charged\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  uhm\n\nreally  <- >   dispensed on the basis of not\n\nthe personality of the parties involved you know but the circumstances the\n\nfacts or what\n\n<$A>  Alright\n So tell me what makes the difference between the decision to send\n\nit to a coroner's court and the decision    to be\n\ncharged for manslaughter\n\n<$B> \n\ncause the prosecutorial authorities    to say\n\neh this from the look of it is something that the man should definitely be\n\ncharged or where one from the older statements that have been\n\ncollected<,>\n Uhm it tends to show that you know sure there was a fatality but\n\nthe circumstances are such that there ought not to be any charge\n But uhm certainly satisfying all the requirements of the law an\n\ninquiry into circumstances surrounding the death of the persons and the\n\ncoroner's inquest is the appropriate  <- > and  and legal\n\nuhm tribunal for    such an inquiry\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  And I think maybe we should tell the public that a coroner's\n\ninquest it's a jury that decides\n So it's left in the hands of the people right\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A>  and\n\nprima facie you said prima facie but sometimes people don't understand that\n\n\non the face of it    there is not enough evidence to\n\nsuggest gross negligence and you leave it to a coroner's inquest to decide\n\nwhether there is gross negligence and it should be tried\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  You see uhm those issues are quite clear and I think that many\n\nof the persons who are phoning in know this quite well\n\n<$A>  No some of them are ignorant though\n\n\n<$B>  you know something\n If people ignorant I think they usually keep themselves quiet\n The fact that the people are phoning in in this way I think shows a\n\nmotive and I'm saying that    on a balance of\n\nprobabilities you cannot tell me that you have so many fatal accidents in\n\nJamaica yearly\n But the great attention has to be sent to the round uhm an issue\n\ninvolving a man who is prominent in public life\n You know what I find very strange in Jamaica though\n Many of the people who are prominent in public life they made it\n\nbig in the commercial world and so on\n They can get away with things which the politicians do not\n\n<$A>  That's correct Sir\n\n\n<$B>

asked to get\n\ninvolved in politics\n I am not here for any personal gain Mr Speaker\n I am here to make a meaningful contribution to my\n\ncountry<,,>\n Since my short journey into representational politics I must say\n\nthat many of the bills being brought to parliament and parliamentary changes\n\ngive me a sense of hope<,>\n Some of these include a shift in power initiated by the Prime\n\nMinister<,>\n implementation of the\n\nconstituency development fund<,> and the fact that the opposition members now\n\nchair most of the committees in parliament<,> and the committees actually are\n\nmeeting on a regular basis<,> to me shows that there are some changes that\n\nare taking place<,>\n I want to thank the Prime Minister for the opportunity to serve my\n\ncountry as a minister\n I have great respect for you Mr Prime Minister and I will endeavour\n\nto make you proud<,>\n Mr Speaker my greatest desire is to see Jamaica really progressing\n\ntowards sustainable social and economic development<,>\n In as short a time as possible I want to see Jamaica genuinely\n\nmoving forward and I'm proud to be part of that process<,>\n I thank the Lord for guiding me through this journey and trust that\n\nHe will hear our prayers as we travel along a way to a better day a better\n\nlife for Jamaicans\n\n\n sectorial debate is organized into two parts\n with the\n\naspects of my portfolio responsibilities in the Ministry of Industry\n\nInvestments and Commerce<,> of which I am the Minister of State and then I\n\nwill deal with the developments in my constituency<,>\n Mr Speaker I now turn my attention to the aspects of the portfolio\n\nresponsibilities<,>\n The primary focus of the ministry at this time is to facilitate\n\nbusinesses in order to achieve growth and development<,>\n through the provision of enabling environment plays a\n\nkey role in the development of enterprises\n My focus will therefore be the selected matters which serve to\n\nfoster that enabling environment among other things\n While the role of government is to facilitate the creation of an\n\nenabling environment as a businessman with business in several countries I\n\nwould like to suggest to this honourable House that businesses also have an\n\nimportant role to play in creating an enabling environment\n Mr Speaker I believe that today the most important concern\n\nregarding the enabling environment is crime\n Much of that crime is due to the lack of income which is earned\n\nthrough employment\n In a market economy it is the role of the private sector to help\n\ncreate employment so that people can get legitimate income\n As a businessman Mr Speaker I am here to tell the honourable House\n\nthat I contribute to the creation of that enabling environment by investing\n\nin some labour intensive projects that create employment in the vicinity of\n\nmy business<,>\n for\n\nthe idle hands around my business establishment\n\n\nand so I invite  and I so invite my business colleagues who\n\nare listening to me to reflect seriously on this point\n Use your creativity and see how you can facilitate the creation of\n\nsome jobs in the vicinity of your business\n I will even go further and say\n See how you can facilitate the creation of a few jobs for youths\n\nlikely to become bad men<,>\n You do not have to employ them directly\n You can fund certain types of businesses either individually or as\n\na group that will create employment for the youths on the corner\n Let me hurry to say I fully recognize that when you employ a\n\ncertain quality of labour that is perhaps less efficient it could affect your\n\ncompetitiveness\n However in the same way that a company makes a social investment in\n\npotential bad men by employing them the society needs to make a social\n\ninvestment in them by  <- >   purchasing\n\ntheir goods and services they produce\n Over time as you pump them into the training and development they\n\nwill become more efficient the unit cost will fall and quality of products\n\nwill rise\n\n\ncompany makes in employing    these persons\n\nand the investment that the society makes in purchasing the goods and\n\nservices<,> they produce    is far less the\n\ncost of instability they would create\n Mr Speaker I provide this insight to my business colleagues because\n\nthe background of my extensive business experience and certainly and\n\ntherefore ladies and gentlemen I want to just say that this should be a\n\npartnership with government\n J B D C\n and J B D C is now creating incubators in\n\nconstituency and we want  both the Member of Parliaments to partner\n\nwith business interests<,>    to create\n\nthat training and that kind of skills<,> so that we can employ more\n\nyouths    and give them an opportunity in those\n\ncommunities out there\n Mr Speaker the business textbook call it social responsibility and\n\nbeing a good corporate citizen\n\n\nme Mr Speaker the professor is right\n Mr Speaker I want to turn next to the need of Jamaicans to invest\n\nin their country\n\n\n  they will have to be a creative\n\nand innovative in defining business opportunities and organizing themselves\n\nto take    advantage of the opportunities\n have you ever wonder why Jamaican business people\n\ncomplain about the business environment and yet others from elsewhere are\n\nable to come and find investment opportunity here\n\n\ncreativity and innovativeness<,>\n Here I speak from a personal experience and therefore can challenge\n\nevery    Jamaican businessperson\n\nto try and see their country through the eyes of others and invest in their\n\ncountry\n local direct\n\ninvestment Mr Speaker\n\n\n  we grow and develop the economy without significant\n\nlocal direct investment\n While the country has we do not believe that we will grow and\n\ndevelop the economy without significant local investment\n country has considerable\n\ncapital in the banking system too much of it is going into consumption\n\n\nand fancy houses\n While I am not against ownership of any fine things I am simply\n\nsaying that the mix is wrong\n Our priority is wrong\n We need to invest more into productive assets that will create\n\nadditional employment so distribute income and whereby contribute to social\n\nstability<,>\n one\n\nlevel benefits  lead directly to the announcement of my\n\npersonal  will<,> and at a higher level I invest in the social\n\nenvironment in which I live to make it a better place in the long run to do\n\nbusiness live and rear my family\n It is therefore fundamental Mr Speaker that we facilitate the\n\nemergence of new generation of enlightened   \n\nentrepreneur who have a broader view of life\n The old ways of thinking having no place in the new and rigorous\n\nbusiness environment underpinned by globalization<,>\n I wish to now turn my attention to the business facilitation with\n\nrespect to the ministry\n Mr Speaker one of the mechanisms through which we facilitate\n\nbusiness is our work of implementing agencies<,>\n\n\noffices of Jamaica\n The company offices of Jamaica is responsible for the registration\n\nand regulation of  business names and industrial and \n\nprovident society\n Through the Companies Amendment Bill we are now seeking to improve\n\n   transitional arrangements for\n\ncompanies registered under the Companies Act nineteen sixty-five and to amend\n\nthe act to allow deregistration of companies that failed to file articles of\n\ncontinuation<,>\n I must say that at one time company offices was one of the stars\n\namong the executive agencies\n Unfortunately however we are currently receiving adverse reports\n\nregarding the high rejection rates for registering new companies\n\n\n  prescribed form<,> in the new Companies Act\n\n\n and are moving as quickly as possible to eliminate the causes of\n\nthe frustration being experienced by many businesses that have to interface\n\n   with this agency<,>\n\n\nproperty office Mr Speaker we recognize that an effective patent and\n\ntrademark system plays an important role in fostering the entrepreneurial\n\nspirit innovation and commerce and we intend to modernize the legislative uh\n\nregime of the Patents and Trademarks Act\n Mr Speaker I'm sure you heard many of the things the former speaker\n\nmentioned in her  <- >   in her speech a while\n\nago about the fact that uhm we're going to be doing a lot to bring our\n\nculture and our trademarks and our uhm brand overseas\n\n\n  and the legislative agenda that we have here a lot of\n\nthese uh brands    will be stolen\n\n   or cheated  <- > or or  or be\n\ntaken from us and Jamaica Intellectual Property which

contribute\n\nto national economic growth and development and to realize the potential\n\nbenefits of the right holders in Jamaica\n Currently Mr Speaker we're amending the Copyright Act

water carries no colour and water must never ever be tainted with\n\npolitics<,>\n I think the matter was\n\nin reference to a situation which might have occurred in another constituency\n\nwhich<,>

level\n\nof passion we bring to the debate in the level of reasoning and commitment\n\nthat we display<,>\n And Madam Speaker I want to turn to a critical issue because for me\n\nthe most important factor that has eluded us as a country as we strive for\n\neconomic growth and development and as we look at our other successes\n whether it's in the\n\nfield of sports entertainment and so on\n I have to say that we haven't been able to get the economic\n\nquestion right largely because of a failure for   \n\non our part to arrive at a consensus in relation to industrial\n\ndevelopment\n I am sensing Madam Speaker that we are just about there and that\n\nsometimes when you listen to our friends in the Opposition speak you\n\nunderstand more and more that the gap is not as wide\n There are some uh important differences in terms of detail but in\n\nthis day and age of globalisation<,> as we understand the reality of a W T O\n\nworld<,> the avenues the room for manoeuvring is no longer<,> as great as\n\nthey used to be and more and more we have to converge and we have to\n\napproach<,> our development in a more consensual way\n And I start this discussion in appealing let us as we move forward\n\nbecause already people are talking about North East Saint Ann and saying\n\n what will happen if<,>\n I mean I can deal with the if question but people are saying\n\n are we still gonna pursue this path for growth and development is the\n\nI T sector still gonna be promoted and I have no doubt<,> that\n\ndespite some other of our differences you share as well as we do the views in\n\nterms of the areas that are<,> going to promote growth for us in terms of the\n\nopportunities and that in the long run we all will be able to embrace<,> the\n\nconcept of the National Industrial Policy together\n Madam Speaker the National Industrial Policy was promulgated in\n\nnineteen ninety-six<,> and the policy really has no mystique to it\n It is a very simple document\n we saw a process of\n\nin-depth analysis that went into looking at where we're coming from as a\n\ncountry looking at where we are and how we are going to proceed\n And the National Industrial Policy recognises that there were\n\ncertain harsh decisions certain realities that we are confronted with<,> but\n\nthat there were certain common things that we have to agree on\n It spoke about macro-economic stability promoting growth export-led\n\ngrowth\n It spoke about liberalisation and privatisation competition the\n\nrole of competition technology the use of technology human resource\n\ndevelopment\n\n\ntries to identify for us<,> areas based on our historical performance based\n\non new opportunities that we could now<,> grasp and to focus on so as to\n\nachieve greater growth in our economy and employment creation<,>\n minimal growth and growth is\n\nbetter than no growth regardless of the size we are looking in the new year\n\nMadam Speaker of my budget speeches entitled  Going for More\n\nGrowth\n\n And you know Madam Speaker when we look around and we see the level\n\nof negativism<,> that pervades\n I just recently did a brief survey on some companies in Jamaica\n\nbrief survey\n I visited some and I looked at some of their books and we can trace\n\nthe growth in Jamaica<,>\n I am very pleased to see in the House this afternoon Mr Lascelles\n\nChin from Lasco\n and they are\n\nprojecting this year to record growth of a similar amount\n technology is a company\n\nthat recognises that if we are going to survive<,> in this global world we\n\ncan't be traditional in our thinking\n We have to move away from the box\n the means by which we can compete\n\neffectively<,>\n And I really want to commend Lascelles Chin\n is one of a number of\n\nBerger Paints worldwide yet Berger Paints Jamaica won the Chairman's    Prize for being the best Berger Paints in the world our\n\nown Berger Paints in Jamaica<,> tremendous growth last year<,>\n And I could go on\n\n I don't smoke but I am very pleased to see the level of\n\nproductivity gains<,> at the cigarette company outperforming the similar\n\ncompany in Trinidad and   \n\nTobago double digit growth<,,>\n And uh Madam Speaker two weeks ago I visited Ashman's Food\n\nProcessors<,> in Saint Catherine and this is a small company that because of\n\nthe opportunity now that has been created for  ackee in half a\n\nyear    they have doubled\n\ntheir production and they are increasing employment<,>\n as\n\na result of the work that we are doing with industry and commerce is\n\na result of some of the policies that we are implementing and I just want to\n\ntouch on some of those policies because yesterday we were given a diet \n\n  of negative  vibes from the Opposition in\n\nrelation to the view of the private sector and also of the level of\n\nconfidence but I'm sensing that it is entirely different\n bills were passed\n\nin this House providing tremendous incentives<,> for the private sector\n Madam Speaker the amendment to the Industrial Incentives Factory\n\nConstruction Act<,> those amendments sought to replicate the incentives that\n\nwere before then available to manufacturers in relation to the construction\n\nof factories\n Now those incentives are being provided for anybody who is involved\n\nin business so the service sector<,> is now being embraced for these\n\nincentives and that is a tremendous<,> boon because as we look to an I T\n\nindustry that requires office space we want to encourage our private sector\n\ncolleagues to be a part of that\n\n\nAm  was the Export Industry Encouragement Act<,>\n Again we are extending concessions that before then were available\n\nonly to manufacturers to the services sector\n Exemption from income and dividend taxes for up to fifteen years\n\n\n    import duties for machinery\n\nand equipment through the same period<,>\n Madam Speaker as we move more and more into an economy that is not\n\nabandoning manufacturing because we do believe that we have to work to get\n\nour manufacturing sector uh continue to grow as we did last year and we have\n\nto work to modernize an industry\n it is in relation to services that we are\n\nlikely to see the fastest growth<,> and the Information Technology sector has\n\nalready been cited\n And I am very pleased to announce this afternoon Madam Speaker that\n\nCabinet on Monday took a very important decision  <->   on\n\nTuesday because we are now removing all duties from all computers\n\nthat are imported into Jamaica effective immediately<,,>\n yes the import duties were\n\nremoved some time ago\n This last amendment is to remove all G C T on computers\n\nequipment\n So these equipment not all the hardware but the software

{'text': "<$A>  We are not opposed to the containment of cost of living for\n\nsingle digit levels\n\n The only difference as my presentation will demonstrate as it is\n\nunfolding Mister Speaker is that when we achieved the low inflation in the\n\nnineteen eighties especially in the latter part of the nineteen eighies we\n\nwere able at the same time to create jobs and we were able to grow the\n\neconomy\n Mister Speaker low\n\ninflation without growth can't help us\n Low inflation without creating jobs Mister Speaker cannot help us\n\nbecause ultimately the people    can't\n\nbuy low inflation the people must have jobs\n But the fundamental issue is that when you take the route of using\n\nhigh interest rates to pay the rich not to invest because that is what is\n\nhappening now let us understand what is happening Mister Speaker\n We take high interest rates to pay the rich not to invest their\n\ncapital into productive    activities\n In other words we are telling the rich don't put your money into\n\ncement and steel and building\n Don't put your money into structures and investment and\n\nfactoriesPut your money into government paper and you will earn a lot of\n\ninterest and you don't have to do anything else\n\nwith it<,>\n And then turn around and impose burdensome taxes Mister Speaker and\n\nuse the fees on the poor and the working people in order to find the money\n\nnow to pay the wealthy and the rich for doing absolutely nothing with their\n\ncapital\n That is what is happening in the country today\n Then not only is this cruel and downright unjust but the low\n\ninflation attained by going this route will not be sustainable and does not\n\nhave a credible long-term basis\n This is what the Minister of State on your side is now\n\nacknowledging and is also resulting in the disturbances on our streets Mister\n\nSpeaker\n be\n\na <unclear> word</unclear> and we are finding so now\n Over the past six years the opposition and many analysts have\n\nspoken against the dangers of using this prolonged high interest rate\n\nstrategy to transfer massive amounts of wealth  \n\n from the have less to the have most or from the poor to the rich\n So eloquently attested to by the member from Central Kingston as a\n\nmeans of reducing inflation\n We warned that this would ultimately not only lead to much pain and\n\nfew gain but would lead to major economic and financial collapse\n And the destruction of the economy as we have witnessed over the\n\npast several years is likely to take a long time Mister Speaker to rebuild\n The chickens are now coming home to roost and this budget tells us\n\nthat <unclear> words</unclear> is here\n Mister Speaker it is unjust and unfair for a government that has\n\nbeen in a state of denial for the past six years about the inevitable\n\nconsequences of its bad policies on the economy and the society and has now\n\nturned around to unleash economic terrorism on the citizens to extort heavy\n\nfines on motorists especially taxi operators\n Bear in mind that many persons who are now taxi operators have been\n\ncasualties of several rounds of redundancies and down-sizing and right-sizing\n\nand capsizing in the business sector\n Some of these persons took a part of their redundancy money to\n\nstart a little business by operating a taxi service to fill an important\n\nsegment of a poor public transportation system\n is now being boxed out of the most of these taxi\n\noperators\n Mister Speaker how can motorists be asked to buy into the\n\nminister's low inflation model when from one side of the mouth of the\n\ngovernment it says fights and wage increases should be kept in single digit\n\nbecause inflation is in single digit\n But from the other side of the mouth the same government decides to\n\ninflict a whole slew of new and punitive fines on motorists which bear little\n\nrelationship to inflation and they are not limited just to the motorists\n\n\nlicence\n\n\ndollars to two thousand dollars an increase of seven thousand nine hundred\n\npercent\n Seven thousand nine hundred percent increase in the fee to get\n\nmarried in Jamaica\n Never in the history of this country has the government been able\n\nto extract so much resources from the society through the G C T tax the wide\n\nrange of other taxes user fees cost sharing scheme and we know all of them\n\neducation health parish council taxes about twenty-two of them property taxes\n\ncemetery fees transport fees and the latest one now to give birth Mister\n\nSpeaker a new one a new creature is called the Executive Agency Tax\n That is the latest one with one common aim soak the poor a little\n\nmore\n That is all it is about\n Yet we cannot see the benefits in either better roads better\n\nequipped and staffed hospitals and schools\n Instead we have pending closure of hospitals downgrading of\n\nhospitals and public debt obligation that now take of sixty-two cent out of\n\nevery dollar of the expenditure budget\n The government is now unleashing Mister Speaker a reign of terror\n\nand economic repression upon the tax paying public to find the money to pay\n\nthe interest on government instrument\n For example I am reliably informed that agents of the general\n\nconsumption tax department have been making arbitrary assessments on\n\ncompanies that have already been up to date on the filing of their\n\nreturn and the payment of their taxes\n And take my advice yes I can prove it\n Minister\n\nof Finance wants me to provide him with the information I will provide him\n\nwith the information<,>\n Take my advice Mister Speaker the level of harassment of tax payers\n\nis going to intensify in nineteen ninety-nine and next year because the\n\ngovernment is now broke and as the economy continues to contract the tax\n\nrevenue base too will continue to contract\n know now Mister Speaker with a new revenue\n\nadministration bill and a new creature called the R P D and we are seeing all\n\nthe signs now of a tendency to begin to harass taxpayers\n That is now on the cards\n On television recently frustrated farmers from St Elisabeth have\n\nthe answer Mister Speaker\n They were offering to pay their taxes with live cattle and\n\nvegetables for which there is no market in this increasingly depressed\n\neconomy<,> and note out some votes from South\n\nWest St Elisabeth\n Mister Speaker in the mean time the process by which high interest\n\nrates are being used to transfer wealth from the poor to the rich will \n\n  intensify in this financial year\n The critical and important question is how much longer can this\n\ncondition last\n The minister should also tell the country and this Honourable House\n\nhow much of the success in keeping inflation in the target of six to eight\n\npercent range was attributable to the significant fall in all prices last\n\nyear\n And the extent to which lower all prices helped to balance off\n\npayment and kept some pressure off of the exchange rate in nineteen\n\nninety-eight ninety-nine\n This is of significance because STATIN has reported that the two\n\nmain groups which accounted for the one point one percent fall in the\n\nconsumer price index in the month of February this year was still \n\nwith another household supply which saw a decline of two point six\n\npercent and housing and another expenses with a decline of six point eight\n\npercent\n And the principal contributing factor to the fall in the consumer\n\nprice index in these groups was the Jamaica Public Service Company rebate on\n\nelectricity bills which commenced in February\n It is also important to take note that in nineteen ninety-eight the\n\nvalue of imported mineral fuels and lubricants declined by some U S one\n\nhundred and seventeen million dollars below the ninety ninety-seven level\n This figure gives some indication Mister Speaker of the magnitude\n\nof the windfall benefits from lower all prices\n And the positive effect on the current account and ultimately on\n\nthe inflation and exchange rates last year\n It is also important to note that the movements reported in the C P\n\nI bear very little relationship to the movements in the course at the\n\nproduction end\n I've spoken to you about that before\n This is why in the absence of a producer's cost\n\nindex will we need to have a producer's cost\n\nindex it is not possible to make an intelligent assessment Mister Speaker of\n\nhow the cost of doing business in the country compares with the pattern of\n\nchanges being reported in the final crisis of goods and services at the\n\nconsumer end \n\n<$A>  Thank you very much uh Mister Speaker and I want to assure the\n\nhonourable uh deputy uh leader of the House uh that notwithstanding his\n\nconsiderable generosity I do not intend to avail myself of all that\n\ntime\n Mister Speaker I suggest that what is happening in the economy will\n\nthat for example where it is costing one hundred dollars to produce a product\n\nthe business man is prepared to sell it for ninety-five dollars or ninety\n\ndollars in order to literally cut resources and  run\n In trying to close the gap between his cost at one hundred dollars\n\nand a selling price let's say ninety dollars he will try to cut cost\n\nrental<,> cheaper sources of input<,> but ultimately if that process is\n\nunsuccessful Mister Speaker he ultimately has to close the doors of his\n\nbusiness putting more people on the unemployment heap\n He too the owners of business and factories in Jamaica the\n\nentrepreneurs of Jamaica are suffering from the deflationary spiral and high\n\ninterest rate policies\n And the people who lose their jobs and become surplus demonstrators\n\nand surplus  road dotters on the streets\n Those are the people who are now beginning to understand the\n\nconnection between government policy and their own lives Mister Speaker\n We must all therefore recognise and acknowledge that this\n\ndeflationary spiral which is underpinned by the high interest rate policy of\n\nthe government is far more devastating to the economy than an inflationary\n\nspiral even\n The fact is that neither is desirable\n\n\nministers' constant drag of low inflation has been achieved at great cost\n\nto the productive capacity of the country and to the poor who with reduced\n\npurchasing power must still take on an increasingly heavy burden of taxation\n The challenges to achieve low inflation and economic growth at one\n\nand the same time\n We have done it before\n We must do it again\n Mister Speaker tell the person that I met yesterday in Mandeville\n\nat the Mandeville Public Hospital\n\ntell the person that I met in Mandeville at the Public Hospital yesterday who\n\n   works as an orderly at the hospital who earns\n\nthree hundred dollars per day and who must spend one hundred and ninety\n\ndollars per day to cover transportation and lunch\n And still pay N I F N H T education tax and at the end of a\n\nfortnight is left with only three hundred and eighty dollars to feed the\n\nfamily\n Pay utility bills send the children to school pay the cost sharing\n\nfee\n Let the minister tell that man about his low inflation model and he\n\nwill tell the minister what to do with that model\n Mister\n\nSpeaker<,> something is wrong with the presence of some people in this House\n\nthe only thing that is wrong with it\n In his presentation last year the Minister of Finance promised to\n\nreduce the interest rate on government paper to between twelve to fifteen\n\npercent above the inflation rate\n With treasury bill and bank reverse with purchase rate now at\n\ntwenty-one to twenty-two percent the minister might be bold enough to claim\n\nthat his target was met but the thing about that Mister Speaker is that if\n\nthe minister is fair he would admit that while that target was met it was met\n\n   at the end of the year\n the treasury bill rate started at the\n\nbeginning of the year at twenty-seven percent Mister Speaker<,> or higher", 'subdomain':

central driving force that we have to deal with as a global family\n Limited greenhouse gas induced climate change Mr Speaker is among\n\nthe most serious environmental challenges facing both industrialised and\n\ndeveloping nations\n\nwarming on island states such as Jamaica cannot be overstated<,>\n Recent studies have shown Mr Speaker that if the current pace of\n\nglobal warming continues unabated<,>    both\n\nthe Norman Manley and Sangster International Airports could be\n\nseriously affected by the sea by the year two thousand and sixty\n they could be\n\ncovered by

was one hundred and ten million barrels<,,>\n two billion U S\n\ndollars or eighty four billion Jamaican dollars\n In the year two thousand Mr Speaker alone the nation consumed just\n\nover twenty

as leaders<,> as\n\nvisitors to the<,,> parliament<,,> we exercise God's will<,> and that\n\nwhatever is done we realise<,,> that His people<,> must be served<,,>\n\n\n<$B>  this country went through one of\n\nthe most<,> difficult periods in recent times\n and\n\nwe are yet to assess its full extent\n the demonstrations went well beyond the realm of\n\nlegitimate protest and provided an excuse for those with an entirely\n\ndifferent agenda<,,> and at the same time gave cover to those with a purely\n\ncriminal intent<,>\n This government has a strong tradition of defending and upholding\n\nthe democratic process\n as a\n\ngovernment<,,> and from the party<,> the People's National Party which\n\nconstitutes this administration<,,>\n It is the basic philosophy of the right of people to free and\n\nlegitimate self-expression<,> that has been at the heart of the policies of\n\nour sixty year old party\n the right of peaceful\n\ndemocratic protest was fully respected and upheld<,,>\n\n\ndo not give it power<,> so that we can use it for ourselves<,>\n Power is held in sacred trust and good trustees should always be\n\ncareful to take into full account those on whose behalf they are allowed to\n\nexercise this power<,,>\n and the\n\nnation today<,,>\n this budget\n\nexercise was easily the most difficult one in which I have ever been engaged\n\nsince first I entered the Cabinet in nineteen seventy-two\n It was a difficult struggle to close the gap between what we\n\nneeded<,> to spend to provide essential services and to fuel growth in the\n\neconomy<,> and the resources that were available on the revenue side<,>\n The most careful and wide ranging considerations were applied to\n\nthis task\n\n over finding workable\n\nsolutions to address the onerous competing national demands<,> in the context\n\nof rising expectations<,,> and scarce resources<,,>\n serve to remind us if any reminder were\n\never necessary<,> that in the final analysis any solution we devise as a\n\ngovernment cannot succeed without the understanding and the involvement of\n\nthe people<,,>\n Last week in this parliament I announced the establishment of a\n\nbroad based committee<,,> headed by Mr Peter Moses President of the P S O\n\nJ<,,>\n He won't be asked as some cartoons have suggested to lead us across\n\nthe sea and what he has been  offered is not cast in tablets of\n\nstone<,,>\n The aim was to bring a participatory dimension on how best to deal\n\nwith what is undoubtedly a problem that is fraught with complex\n\nconsiderations\n The committee consisted of Professor Trevor Munroe independent\n\nSenator who served as the Vice Chairman Mr Eddie Bailey President of the\n\nJamaica Civil Service Association<,> Reverend Stanley Clark of the Jamaica\n\nCouncil of Churches<,> Mr Franklin McDonald of the Barbican Youth and\n\nCommunity Development Association<,> Miss Franzia Edwards of the Jamaica N G\n\nO Council<,> Reverend Webster

Whittingham of\n\nthe Jamaica Vendors Higglers and Markets Association as well as the Central\n\nCommunity Development Association<,,>\n the introduction of their report by placing on\n\nrecord<,> my own appreciation that of the entire Cabinet and indeed I believe\n\nall members of the House for the work that they did in a very short period of\n\ntime<,,>\n Some would have resisted the invitation to serve\n to reflect their concern to\n\nthemselves<,> but to work<,,> in a consensual way towards opposing a\n\nsolution<,,>\n They have worked against time and around the clock\n In the short period of their existence they received inputs from\n\nsome fifty-eight organisations and individuals<,,> and they had of course to\n\ntake into account all that was said and done<,> last week<,,>\n as I had promised in this house all the\n\ndocuments from the budget some fifteen in all and they also got detailed\n\ntechnical information from the Ministry of Finance and Planning<,> whose\n\nofficers were available constantly to assist them in their deliberations and\n\nto whom also we should say thanks<,,>\n in the\n\ncourse of being done now<,> to make a copy of that report in full<,>\n\nunexpurgated to every member of this House and to the media<,,>\n in respect\n\nof each and every item<,> that they contemplated<,,>\n but I just\n\nwant to focus<,> on some of the most important areas on which they\n\ndeliberated and to indicate what are their recommendations<,,> on some of\n\nwhich it will be possible to act immediately<,> and others of which will be\n\nacted upon<,> in a timely fashion<,,>\n\n\nprimarily<,> with a question of the effect of the gas price increases on the\n\npublic as a whole<,> and seeking how to best cushion those effects<,> that\n\nthey had to do their work even in a short period in a much wider context<,>\n\nand to quote from their report they accepted the challenge to make\n\nappropriate recommendations<,,> dealing not only with the fuel price\n\nincrease<,> but in the circumstances of the time<,> with broader questions of\n\ngovernance and communication<,,>\n The committee proceeded to review the recent increase in the fuel\n\ntax<,,> and it proposed a number of measures to increase revenues and reduce\n\nexpenditures in order to close the gap resulting from any adjustments to the\n\ntax<,,>\n the\n\ncommittee also made recommendations<,> aimed at addressing some of the social\n\nconcerns that everyone accepts to have been at the heart<,> of the\n\ndemonstrations<,>\n greater\n\nequity in the dispensation of justice<,> and enhancing the communication\n\nprocess between the government and the citizen<,,>\n These issues all address the need for a new paradigm in\n\ngovernance<,> which we have always taken very seriously<,> and will continue\n\nto do and with which we have every intention of dealing<,> because we have\n\nrecognised that they go to the very heart of the public<,>\n And this is going to require commitment and sustained action over a\n\nconsiderable period of time<,,>\n which the\n\ncommittee worked assiduously in putting forward<,> will engage our urgent\n\nconsideration with a view to their introduction at timely intervals<,> and\n\nbecause I do not make a pronouncement on each and every one of them today<,>\n\nit should not be interpreted to mean<,> that we regard them as unacceptable\n\nfar from being so we will implement them in the course of time as quickly as\n\nthe situation allows<,,>\n the main bone of\n\ncontention<,,> the committee<,> recommended that there should be a roll-back\n\nin the existing tax<,> that was imposed on gasoline by fifty per cent<,,>\n on the table of this House in\n\nthe course of this sitting spelling out what that means<,> to leaded and\n\nunleaded gasoline<,> to diesel fuel<,,>\n I want to draw\n\nparticular attention to the question of kerosene oil<,,> as it relates to\n\nkerosene oil that  committee has recommended that the\n\ngovernment reduce the additional tax<,> by ninety per cent<,>\n by fifty per\n\ncent instead and it is important that I say why<,,>\n The price differential between kerosene and the other petroleum\n\nproducts that is to say gasoline and diesel oil was removed in    December nineteen ninety-five when we eliminated\n\nkerosene subsidies<,,>\n was not\n\nconsumed largely by people for lamp lighting<,,> and<,> for cooking<,>\n by other persons some of whom were engaged\n\nin the transportation sector<,,> that were using the cheaper price<,,> to\n\noperate<,> and what was happening was there was full-scale kerosene\n\ncontamination<,,>\n the elimination of the kerosene subsidy what has\n\nhappened is that those who traditionally misused it as a substitute for\n\ndiesel oil<,> or as an illegal extender for gasoline immediately lost the\n\nincentive to do so<,> and there was a decline in consumption<,,>\n that in case we were to restore such a large\n\ndifferential<,> as was proposed between the price of kerosene<,> and that of\n\ndiesel oil or gasoline<,> the problem of misuse would return to the trade<,>\n which have been\n\nagreed<,> and which will be reflected in the Ministry Paper<,> I wish to\n\nremind this Honourable House<,> that the commitment which was given still\n\nstands\n there'll be\n\nno increase in the price of cooking gas<,> and when the time comes<,> for\n\ntransportation rates to be adjusted the children the aged and the physically\n\nchallenged will not be required to pay any increase in bus\n\nfares<,><,,>\n there's going to\n\nbe a shortfall<,> of one point four billion dollars<,> in the budget<,,>\n\nand<,,> we had several alternatives<,,>\n\n that one could not at this\n\nstage precisely calculate what the benefits would be and since we want to\n\nhave a tight and credible budget<,> we think it is better<,> to forgo them at\n\nthis stage in the    budget presentation and to\n\nafford ourselves some time<,> for detailed consideration with the passage of\n\ntime<,,>\n will announce by way of a\n\nMinisterial Statement followed by a Ministry Paper what are the new measures\n\nthat will be introduced to make up the shortfall<,> but I can say without any\n\nair of successful contradiction that they will not impact adversely on the\n\npoor or on the socially disadvantaged<,>\n in their\n\ndetails on proposed expenditure cuts<,,> a sum of eight hundred million\n\ndollars for interest rate<,> reductions<,,>\n over the past few years the Bank of\n\nJamaica has established an enviable track record in terms of meeting monetary\n\ntargets and correspondingly realising material reductions in the inflation\n\nrates<,,>\n in growing investor confidence in B O\n\nJ's ability to meet declining inflation targets<,,>\n This fiscal year's goal of a forty-six per cent inflation rate\n\ngives the B O J a push-on to further lower nominal rates<,>\n With this hard-earned credibility in place we believe the

{'text': "<$A>  For fiscal year two thousand and one two thousand and two the\n\ngovernment would seek to raise approximately four hundred million dollars U S\n\non the international capital markets\n A to maximise the\n\nbenefits of our healthy external account indicators by accessing funds at\n\ncheaper interest rates<,> than those which were available domestically and B\n\nby allowing additional resources to be   \n\navailable for the private sector<,> by reducing the level of\n\ngovernment borrowings from the domestic capital market<,,>\n Madam Speaker the first tranche of this four hundred million dollar\n\nU S target was raised when the government of Jamaica successfully issued its\n\nfirst ten year year up bond for an amount of U S two hundred and seventy five\n\nmillion dollars a few weeks ago\n\n Subsequently Beers Sterns the institution which the lead manager for\n\nthe initial transaction approached us with a proposal to reopen the bond\n\noffering for an amount of between U S one hundred million dollars and U S a\n\nhundred and twenty-five million dollars<,>\n A\n\nthere was strong performance of the bond in the secondary market<,> as\n\nreflected    both by the activity in the\n\nsecondary market and by the fact that<,> those seeking to purchase the bond\n\nwere willing to accept the lower interest rates than the twelve per cent\n\noriginally offered and B there was substantial   \n\nunfulfilled demand as some large U S   \n\ninstitutional investors had not received their full allocation in the\n\ninitial issue while others simply wished to purchase more bonds\n\n\nallocation had been reduced because of the cap and then there are others who\n\nalthough they received the amount they bid for<,> given the strong\n\nperformance in the secondary market some simply wish to purchase more\n\nbonds<,,>\n The Ministry of Finance felt that reopening up the issue at that\n\ntime would be advantageous since the environment for emerging market issuers\n\nlike Jamaica could become difficult given the problems of Brazil and\n\nArgentina<,>\n\n\n  would<,> be available in the future when the funds\n\nwere actually needed on similar attractive terms\n The point Madam Speaker is that we do not actually need the\n\nresources at this point in time but the question we face given the problems\n\nfaced by Argentina and the issues of political instability    in Brazil\n\n\nsomething called the contagion effect whereby regardless of what your\n\nsituation is as long as there are problems in other similarly  <- >   ranked countries they impact negatively    on your situation\n There was a question as to when the funds were actually needed in\n\nthe future whether would be able to access the market on similar attractive\n\nterms<,>\n With the decision taken to reopen the issue the offer was quickly\n\nover-subscribed with over U S two hundred million dollars in orders<,>\n\nhowever the amount taken up was capped at a hundred and twenty-five million\n\ndollars thus bringing the total issue size to U S four hundred million\n\ndollars two seventy-five million in the first tranche and a hundred and\n\ntwenty-five million dollars in the second tranche<,>\n For the record Madam Speaker what was most significant was that the\n\nissue was announced<,> launched and priced within two\n\nhours<,,>\n\n\nthe<,>  the privilege and the opportunity to lead our<,> first\n\nforay into the private capital markets in recent time I recall when<,> going\n\nout for a hundred million dollar bond<,> was a ten day<,> kill dead road\n\ntrip<,,>\n\n\nand priced and totally over-subscribed in two hours\n dollars\n\npoint six two five dollars per hundred<,> U S dollars given a yield of eleven\n\npoint four seven<,> dollars compared to a yield of twelve per cent<,> for the\n\ninitial offer\n Madam Speaker the improvement in the price and the yield in such a\n\nshort period of time is nothing but a clear indication of the growing\n\nexternal investor confidence in Jamaica\n\n<$B>  Hear hear\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  let me just put a word of caution\n Our ability to access the U S four hundred million dollars early in\n\nthe fiscal year should not be interpreted as a license to relax the tight\n\nfiscal management which I have indicated as being necessary as part of the\n\nconcentrated effort to bring the debt stock under control<,>\n duty to\n\ninform this House that the economic management team is now faced with an\n\ninteresting new problem<,>\n That is how to minimise or eliminate the possibility of a\n\nrevaluation resulting from the release into the system of an excessive amount\n\nof U S dollars<,>\n And so Madam Speaker we have taken interesting position whereby the\n\nadditional amount is being placed in a special account<,> held by the\n\nMinistry of Finance but is not being sold because   \n\nwe worry that selling this additional amount of foreign exchange into\n\nthe market could bring about a revaluation which would be detrimental to the\n\nexport sector<,>\n The second challenge Madam Speaker is to ensure that the\n\ngovernment's reduced take from the domestic capital market results in\n\nsustained reduction in the interest rates on domestic bond issues<,>\n Why is the reduction of interest rates on government paper is\n\ndesirable particularly in terms of the reduced pressure on the fiscal\n\nbudget<,>\n Of equal importance and I'd think to all of us in this Honourable\n\nHouse is the reduction of interest rates faced by the productive sector<,>\n Although there have been positive moves in the recent past there is\n\nstill scope for further reduction in the spreads of the commercial banks<,>\n I'm addressing this to the commercial banks although there have\n\nbeen positive moves in the recent past<,> euphemistically put  it uh\n\nspeaking there's still scope for further reduction in the spreads of the\n\ncommercial banks\n This will simultaneously allow for expansion of existing economic\n\nactivities and or inducing those with significant domestic resources to\n\nconsider investment options as opposed to the more secure alternative of\n\npurchasing government paper\n\n\n<$D> \n\nfact that<,> or the assertion that<,> the<,,> bond could have been priced at\n\na lower interest rates uh let me say that I lead the pack in terms of such a\n\ndemand<,> there is no interest rate at which we have<,> been    we have  been offered\n\n   with which we have been satisfied<,> but\n\nthey say that a deal can only be made by a willing buyer and a willing seller\n\nand<,> I keep hearing    these uhm<,> suggestions\n the proof of this in the sense that I am\n\ninviting anybody with the resources they are willing to lend to us at low\n\ninterest rates to make me an offer uhm I am here\n sums\n\nexist and they are uh sums    the origins of which\n\ncan stand up to close scrutiny<,> we are here    I would never rule it out<,>  I won't turn\n\nthem away but there's a tendency for comments to be made uhm without    any substance behind so   \n\nI hear    the point raised by the Member \n\n  from Central Kingston and I  I\n\n   my response is that if these sums are available\n\n let us talk<,>\n relates to\n\nthe<,,> exclusion    of domestic\n\nbidders from uh participating<,> in the primary issue the first\n\nround<,,>\n a careless\n\nperson or a careless government which doesn't learn<,>\n for\n\nthe    two hundred and twenty-five million U\n\nS dollars<,>\n that more than a half of that two hundred and\n\ntwenty-five million U S dollars originated right here in Jamaica and the\n\nresulting purchase of foreign exchange from the domestic foreign exchange\n\nmarket to finance the purchases of those bonds<,> led us into a period of\n\nturmoil in the foreign exchange market<,> and led us also into a period when\n\nwe had to perhaps the only negative in terms of macro economic management in\n\nfiscal year two thousand two thousand and one was the regrettable reversal in\n\nthe downward movement of interest rates as after selling a hundred and fifty\n\nmillion U S into the market<,> we had to resort to a reversal    of the interest rate trend in order   \n\nto stabilise the foreign exchange market\n\n threw out in the\n\nfirst instance those bids which were clearly out of Jamaica<,,>\n The truth is that in certain instances they simply went unpurchased\n\nin the secondary market so the complaint uttered to the Member of Parliament\n\nfrom Central Kingston the complaint really isn't about the exclusion per se\n\nbut the fact that in purchasing    in the second\n\nround    the deal wasn't as good as if they had\n\nbeen allowed in the first round but what we have been able to do is to\n\nameliorate the impact    on the foreign exchange\n\nmarket\n there's no loss because\n\nthey weren't coming in at a lower bid they were simply  \n\n indicating their desire to be there\n and\n\nI appeal to those with resources in Jamaica<,>\n\n\nfor a hundred and seventy-five million U S<,,> and it is to my certain\n\nknowledge that more than a hundred and seventy-five million U S was\n\navailable<,> from Jamaica to purchase the bonds<,> and the question we must\n\npose and I'm not posing it in any sort of<,>   \n\nany<,> in a sort of condemnatory way the question we must pose is<,>\n\nif people have confidence that any government will repay will  its\n\ndebt and to service its    the bonds<,>\n\nhow is it therefore that Glencore would have the confidence<,> to put up a\n\nhundred and seventy- five million<,,> to purchase these extensive holdings of\n\nAlcan whilst our own investors prefer to remain within the security    of the government paper\n\n\nconfidence in the government paper but    there's an\n\nabsence of a willingness to go forward\n giving away Union Bank\n\nto the Trinidadians<,>    the total sum involved\n\nthere was one point six billion dollars and that is less than forty million U\n\nS\n not\n\ngovernment<,,> as a group of investors because if you look at  B/the N\n\nS's returns<,> not Union Bank no will not necessarily make  B/the N\n\nS's returns but they are going to make more than ten per cent and    I and its something which I'm searching for<,>    a formula to wean our investors away from simply relying on\n\ngovernment paper and moving into areas of investment\n like to meet with these\n\npeople with these sums to say let us talk about possibilities and we have\n\nsome more<,> goodies available for loyal Jamaicans<,,> not

being produced now that retain uhm the copra stage\n in addition to traditional agriculture\n\ngovernment will assist and promote increased domestic crop production to\n\nprovide a greater level of national food security to  \n\n provide more local foodstuff for the tourism sector non-\n\ntraditional export and for agro industry\n Domestic agriculture has been playing an important role in meeting\n\nnational food security needs<,>\n However there is still need for improvement in this regard since a\n\nnational country paper on food security in Jamaica nineteen ninety-six\n\nestimates that there is a significant level of food insecurity in Jamaica\n\nwhich affects thirty per cent of the population or approximately seven\n\nhundred and eighty- three thousand people<,,>\n\n it should be noted that since the abolition\n\nof the    generalised price subsidy programme\n\nper capita consumption of locally grown foods has increased while that of\n\nimported basic foods has remained constant\n The domestic crop sub sector also makes a very important\n\ncontribution to the tourism industry\n hotels with one\n\nhundred rooms<,> and over carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture\n\nindicates strong potential for growth in the use of locally grown food in the\n\nindustry<,>\n For example of a total food bill of two point three billion by the\n\nhotel survey approximately one point eight billion was spent on fresh food\n\nvegetables and types of products produced locally\n One point eight billion dollars\n It should be noted however that the hotels reported that they had\n\nstrong unfulfilled demand for many locally produced fruits vegetables meat\n\nfish and processed foods\n in the hotel sector it is the inconsistency\n\nof supplies\n will go into arrangement with a farmer to supply x\n\npounds on a weekly basis\n That farmer will supply for two three weeks then somebody comes and\n\noffers that farmer a little more and he doesn't go back to that hotel\n\n\nguests you cannot get up one morning and tell them you can't get anything\n\nlike this or that because my farmer from St Elizabeth who was supposed to\n\ncome didn't come\n So the consistency of supply has to be in place\n to import the stuff sometime\n\nbut they are forced to because farmers have not been living up to their\n\ncontractual arrangements<,>\n by bringing\n\nfarmers and hoteliers together and to provide training and specialists to\n\nassist the farmer in production\n there is still a strong\n\ninternational demand for many of the non traditional commodities produced in\n\nJamaica\n The country's proximity to the large ethnic communities in the U S\n\nA provide a ready market for some of these commodities\n However there is serious competition from neighbouring countries\n\nCosta Rica even Brazil and the challenge is for this industry    to concentrate on quality improvement cost control\n\nand efficient coordinated marketing\n In order to support the non traditional export trust government is\n\nimplementing new effective strategies to improve export regulation and to\n\nmeet international competition\n And I spoke of the one stop facility and the pre-clearance\n\nsituation\n In the final analysis however government is cognisant of the fact\n\nthat by far the greatest potential for sustained development of the\n\nagricultural sector will be in the area of agro industry or value added\n Unfortunately the area of agro industry has been the least\n\ndeveloped of all agriculture related sectors\n in the\n\nareas of sugar processing boiler production and the production of fruit\n\njuices\n There are a number of reasons for this but one of the most critical\n\nis the absence of backward linkages between agra processors and producers of\n\nraw material required to provide the needs of the industry<,>\n\n\nconcept<,> of agriculture is to deal with this aspect of agra processing\n to put up a plant with the hope\n\nthat some people will plant some things and then the factory will get it<,>\n The factory is going to go there based on the demand because there\n\nis production there\n And what we are going to be doing in those zones is to really\n\nmaximise production\n so that the\n\npeople who<,> are serious about agra processing will know that there is this\n\npart that has a lack of produce and they will go and put their factory there\n\nand that is what we are going to be doing", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '7edefe9e-2b9d-452b-b6b4-c55e0a6a3845',

union member is produced that has not been copied to that\n\nunion member it cannot be used in any matter relating to that union member\n It becomes null and void\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$X> \n You will have a problem because you will have to go back and sign\n\nall the documents\n\n<$D>  First of August\n From the first of August\n There is a genuine concern here\n\n<$E>  The first of October considering that some would have gone on\n\n<$D>  We could go back to the first of August because we are under\n\na new regime\n In other words anything that happens before the first of August is\n\ndifferent\n\n<$E>  I don't know what sort of numbers\n\n<$A>  What we require go through all of the personal files and pick\n\nup anything which might have been copied to the staff member and say we are\n\nin agreement and then take them out copy them send them to the staff member\n\nsaying please sign these and send them back\n\n<$D>  In an interim period the onus could be on the staff member to\n\ngo physically<,>\n\n<$A>  All staff members should come in and check their personal\n\nfiles\n We were really expecting that but rather to\n We have a deluge of people coming in\n\n<$X> \n Anybody who got letters after the first of August go and sign them\n\nand make sure that copies are regularized\n It is the retroactive aspect that seems to create the problems and\n\nI don't know the distrust\n\n\n<$Y> \n Significantly there is ulterior motive\n Letters that could have accumulated between now and the first of\n\nAugust outside of that the problem is with the individual\n Going in and examining his file whatever time he chooses to do so\n\nduring the process\n\n<$D>  In other words if from the first of October I have not gone\n\nin and checked my file then anything that appeared August the first and\n\nOctober and September thirty which has a C C on it is a valid C C\n In other words the onus is on the member\n If I feel that my Head of Department forgets me and he had sent\n\nsomething and did not copy it to me I would go in and check it but the\n\naverage member would feel that there is no adverse report so then it would\n\njust put the onus on the member who feels that they are at great risk to go\n\nand check the files\n So that if I have not come into the office and actually made a\n\nstatement to say that I object to this\n I didn't get this\n Of course if I say I didn't get this at which stage he would give\n\nme a copy and I think that covers everybody\n And I don't think you will have a rush sir\n\n<$A>  Especially at Assessment and Promotion time so\n\n<$D>  But there are not that many people going\n\n<$A>  There are a number of reports on staff in recent times\n\n<$D>  Yes not everybody is going up front\n\n<$Z> \n\n\ndocuments copied to staff members not seen and signed by that member\n\ncannot be used in anything relating to that matter not seen and signed\n\n<$W> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$D>  You want to sign it\n How does it work in the Civil Service\n\n<$C>  We do see them first before we sign them\n The other one you know about is not in the Civil Service\n\n<$W> \n Document not signed by staff member cannot be used in any matter\n\nrelating to that member\n\n<$A>  That means positive\n\n<$D>  Without their prior consent\n\n<$X> \n It's just that you know it is there and you can always write\n\ncountering\n\n<$W> \n\n\n<$A>  What happens to the staff member who says the thing is\n\ntotally inaccurate\n\n<$C>  You write and copy it to whoever wrote the report\n\n<$A>  When you say that the person is to sign it\n Clearly the signing is not signing of agreement as we understand\n\nbut there could be persons who refuse to sign\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$X> \n You are asking to sign\n\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$A>  Once I sign it it becomes useful and it can be used against\n\nme\n If I don't sign it there is no way you can use it against me\n Assessment is a different thing\n Any document that is not signed by the staff member can be used in\n\na case related to that staff member\n So if I refuse to sign the document that is an invalid document\n It might have very damaging quite true against me\n If I don't sign it you can't\n\n<$C>  But it would seem to me that if a staff member gets a\n\ndocument about himself which has information which is contrary to the fact\n\nthen it beholds that staff member to put something in writing and have it on\n\nthe file side by side that document\n\n<$X> \n You have a right to raise it as a member than have it just being\n\ndealt with\n\n<$F>  Why would I want to sign it\n\n<$B>  If I do not sign it it cannot be used against me\n\n<$D>  Procedurally I see your point but really what happens in the\n\nCivil Service\n\n<$V>  I just want to make a comment\n I was reading somebody's document relating to this provision for a\n\nloan to be made on the file to the person\n If the person actually sees the document and wishes to there is\n\nprovision in the agreement for that a note to be entered on the file which\n\nwould make the document a valid document\n\n<$A>  It's just the wording that we are putting there will lead to\n\nthat\n\n<$X> \n Sometimes you deliver it and that's the end of it and once you\n\nhave registered it it has been served\n\n<$D>  In the event that the member is shown the document and\n\nrefused to sign then that is a fight between me and the Registrar to put a\n\nnote and I never sign\n What happens in the Civil Service\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$D>  Well they are ahead of us at the moment\n\n<$C>  You sign the thing saying that you have seen it but you are\n\nin disagreement but you sign it indicating a decision\n It has been discussed with me but I am in disagreement with it\n\n<$X> \n The case with which I am familiar is the unionized situation\n It doesn't matter if you sign it\n You don't sign in agreement\n\n\n<$D>  That is not the point\n is raising is\n\n<$X> \n If I feel you are not going to sign it I register it to you and\n\nthat is the end of it once I have your address and I register it or not\n\n<$C>  In the real world it is incumbent on a staff member to\n\nrespond to an unfavorable report in writing\n I don't know if it happens in the University\n There is such a thing called the unwritten judgement\n It can't be used but it has been circulated\n Three or four people see it and it influences their decision\n I think it is incumbent that there should be a\n\nresponse\n\n<$F>  The figures that you quoted for thirteen thousand two\n\nhundred and four dollars\n\n<$D>  was reading the\n\nninety-three ninety- four as thirteen thousand two hundred and forty-three\n\ndollars\n Currently the agreement was right but what happened last time\n\nwhen the agreement was signed we were already in the position on the\n\ntwenty-seventh of July nineteen ninety-four\n So the ninety-three ninety-four Grant we didn't press you to give\n\nus an increased figure because then we would have expended it already\n So that the real figure is thirteen thousand two hundred and\n\nforty- three dollars as the base because we gave up one year's Book Grant\n\nbecause we had already\n It took us a year to negotiate the agreement\n\n<$X> \n You are not sending me a message just a statement of fact\n\n\n<$W> \n That one there\n\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$W> \n Good\n So those were the areas we were to find out and give you some\n\nfeedback on\n\n\n<$A>  We had asked you for some kind of schedule regularization of\n\nbenefits and allowances\n It is alright if you dropped it\n\n<$W> \n\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  Item six\n\n<$W> \n What we are asking\n There are a variety of categories that don't receive the benefits\n\nthat are available to people on regular three-year contracts one such\n\ncategory being\n What we are saying is try to regularize everything\n\n\n<$Y> \n There is a document with the benefits\n\n\n<$A> \n\nomission-of-extra-corpus-speech\n\n<$A>  When you start to identify those positions like Book Shop\n\nManager Manager of Printery some of the workers included in D would be that\n\n<$W> \n\n\n<$A>  It could be the same person we are talking about but in\n\ndifferent terms\n These are discreet jobs which have been assessed and now a\n\nquantum of benefits applied to them and you seem to be saying just change the\n\nvalue and just apply something across the board\n\n<$Y> \n I don't understand what you are talking about\n The quantum of benefits came about as a result of what of a\n\ncontract\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Y> \n We are saying that because the Union is involved now we have to\n\napply benefits that are coming out of the union negotiations over and above\n\nwhat they have signed under the contract that was given\n\n<$A>  We need to be looking at the schedule of benefits that are\n\nin relation to those jobs at present because there might be other things\n Those jobs don't really fit here and we need to look at the\n\npackage and see the package in this respect\n\n<$Y> \n Let me give an example here\n Engineers for argument's sake are entitled to Entertainment\n There is a guy who has a specific contract promotion but\n\nPersonnel that gives him Entertainment and does not give him Book Grant\n\n<$A>  Middle management\n\n<$F>  If he is represented by\n He is not in WIGUT\n\n<$W> \n No no we know who we represent\n There is a category of employees in this University that we\n\nrepresent\n Bookstore Managers are handled by personnel\n Middle management board administrative that's your business\n We know who we represent\n\n\n<$A>  I have no doubt about that\n I am just saying that it is a package that we would need to look\n\nat in toto in order to arrive\n The thing is now deficient\n It needs to be upgraded on books\n\n<$A>  In some respects Entertainment would not be relevant\n We have some gaps in some of the categories and we need to fill\n\nout these gaps and apply it across the board to other people but we are\n\nwilling to look at these discreet cases\n\n<$Y> \n We are making the case\n\n\n<$W> \n The thing is we could proceed for the moment on this schedule\n We have already got teaching assistant which is the immediate\n\ncategory\n\n<$A>  We can identify all the teaching assistants that we have\n\n<$W> \n We would like to apply that to Teaching Assistants and to Foreign\n\nLanguage instructors\n We would like it to apply to Accounting Assistants\n In other words the ones that we have got here on this\n\nschedule\n\n<$A>  That is narrowing it down\n If you look at the Assistant Accounting column about six save for\n\none Passage and Baggage Allowances that has the most things\n Are you saying that what you would like is that right across the\n\nboard where we have dashes instead of ticks that means insert ticks that\n\nwould put everybody on the same footing\n\n<$W> \n To be very specific we are not making a claim for Passage and\n\nBaggage Allowance\n\n\n<$A>  I was saying except that\n\n<$W> \n\n\n<$Y> \n You have people who are promoted\n We now represent them\n They used to enjoy Assistance Passage Leave but in the new\n\nBargaining Unit they get nothing\n\n<$A>  I come back with greatest respect\n I think we would be helped by my paraphrase\n You mean everybody should get benefits who are in this schedule\n\nexcept for Passage and Baggage\n That is what I heard you say\n\n<$W> \n\n\n<$A>  If that is what you mean clearly the Dean would like to\n\ndiscuss that further and get back to you\n What is there as I think you clearly understand those positions\n\nhave been arrived at after much thought and careful analysis and there are\n\ndistinctions and differences deliberately put in because the jobs are seen as\n\ndifferent and there are levels in that schedule across the page\n Let everybody get the same benefits so as not to destroy the\n\nposition of the job\n\n<$Y> \n In terms of Housing Allowance for argument's sake why show\n\ndiscrimination in housing\n\n\n<$A>  That is fairly standard in employment\n It depends on the grade the person is in\n some get some don't\n\n<$X> \n In any system you don't have all the benefits not the total\n\nbenefits\n\n<$A>  There are some people who get cars on Campus and some people\n\nwho don't\n\n<$D> \n\n<$A>  Yes if I may attempt to answer that\n There are performance criteria because in assessing and making\n\njudgement about these things which are important and affect the lives of\n\nmembers of staff clearly Administration would not just go about it\n\nwilly-nilly without any basis of arising to something\n As you know it is something that the Vice Chancellor has handled\n\nhimself over time\n\n<$W> \n\n\n<$A>  Now the question is with the old regime we have not been\n\nourselves privy to the criteria but they clearly exist\n I am not saying that there is a problem\n It is now being asked for and the University as I think the other\n\nside is aware is in the process of developing instruments to evaluate staff\n\nat all levels academic staff and I will be expecting in the very near future\n\nthat these instruments which will be applicable to all staff will be assessed\n\nby Heads or Superiors or whatever\n First by peers and by students for teaching staff\n So out of that no doubt would come some kind of dissertation\n\nwhich would apply to the Professorial Rank and that would be a fulfilment of\n\nthat particular lack that there seems to be at the moment\n\n<$W> \n Our comment on our side to the criteria since as you yourself\n\nconfess it presently at the behest that of one of the University officers and\n\nyou yourself don't know the criteria\n\n\n<$A> \n\nomission-of-extra-copus-speech\n\n<$D>  If I got the Registrar correctly we are moving to positions\n\nwhere the criteria would be set down that there will be a performance\n\nevaluation for professors of WIGUT\n\n<$A>  I am making a general statement for all staff\n\n<$D>  But this would be applied to Professors\n\n<$A>  Even those on tenure would be subject to that\n\n<$W> \n Get formal statements on the professors\n So the key issue at this point really is what your response is is\n\nthat it shall continue at or involving the same assessment criteria as\n\ncurrently apply\n What we are saying is that assessment but the lack of it if you\n\nlack it make it automatic very adamant\n This is our argument\n Fine but I put it to you\n\n\n<$A>  Let me ask you whether in fact we have two options\n If satisfactory criteria are being introduced you will go with\n\nthose criteria and that approach\n If none is forthcoming then you want automaticity\n The same criteria that apply to other levels of staff should\n\napply to professors\n Why discriminate against them the evaluation criteria\n However you do it all we are saying the professors must be\n\ntreated equally\n And we want to put it another way\n The same criteria for annual increase which apply to other levels\n\nof the bargaining unit should also apply to professors\n Can you give me one good reason why not\n So you will consider it\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A> \n\nomission-of-extra-corpus-speech\n\n<$D>  We have experienced non-restoring of purchasing power\n That is what we have experience in that but you see the question\n\nis the question of what kind of enterprise are we engaged in\n And with respect to the question of Book Grant it is not really a\n\nlarge sum of money\n The issue of maintaining the Book Grant should really be seen as\n\nan issue in the interest of the University\n It should be the one issue that there shouldn't be any stinting\n\nreally because the Book Grant is a Book Grant\n If you don't spend it on books you cannot get it\n If it is something in which the controls are adequate the\n\nRegistrar or Bursar didn't have to say  subject to adequate\n\ncontrols or what have you\n So that I will appeal to your side sir to really look at it from\n\nthis point of view that I wouldn't introduce this issue that you can't\n\nrestore purchasing power on\n There are certain things that you can't restore purchasing on\n\nthat is certainly one of them\n For years the University has been committed to maintaining\n\nindexation on Study and Travel Grants for good reasons because if you are\n\ngoing to do research you are going to have to travel\n If that wasn't the intention then there would not be any research\n I appeal to your side to really go and look at the Book Grant in\n\na different light\n\n<$X> \n But you have to work the figures out because we were proposing a\n\ntwenty percent first\n We have come back after some discussion and arguments with a\n\nproposal of thirty and ten and ten\n We think that is quite significant\n\n\n<$D>", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'df637c42-22ac-4036-85cf-3cdf5945a3f7', 'added':

{'text': "<$A>  If I don't take a car loan I could take a mortgage loan with\n\nthe extra one hundred thousand\n So that the loan facility you have so much available for car so much\n\nfor mortgage and an additional one hundred thousand if you are getting a\n\nhouse you could get that if you are getting a car you get that\n\n<$B>  The last time you were at eighty thousand on car\n An offer was made of another seventy thousand on different terms\n Nothing was done about mortgage\n That offer still holds but we are saying now in addition to that\n\nthere is another one hundred thousand which is at your choice and discretion\n You can apply it to mortgage or car\n The interest rate will be at the same level of seventy per cent that\n\nis fifty per cent at the prevailing market\n But while we are on that on the prevailing market reference was made\n\nto looking back at how we handled loans and clearly if one person goes to a\n\nbanker to borrow eighty thousand dollars it is on quite different terms than\n\nif ten people went to the same banker we are offering you this block of\n\nbusiness you will come out on much better terms\n Maybe this is what we need to look at for the best terms to come\n\nout\n\n<$A>  Due to the overlapping your proposal would leave some of our\n\nmembers getting a full\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  You are giving them a whole increment or to the next point\n\n<$C>  What might happen when you have the overlapping they don't\n\nmatch point-to-point\n A lecturer five hundred and eighty-four thousand but there is no\n\nfive hundred and eighty- four thousand in Senior Lecturers scale so the\n\nnearest thing you have to that is five hundred and seventy-two and five\n\nhundred and ninety-two\n So if you say they move to the next point what the person gets is\n\nnot full increment but a topping up\n\n<$D>  My understanding of how you currently work that system is\n\nthat the person would move across into the new scale at the point that is\n\nnearest above and then you add the\n\nincrement\n\n<$Y> \n Given the existing arrangement who would now access the health\n\ncentre\n\n<$D>  We have a policy on that actually which is that if the\n\npersons who are in receipt of pension that they will still access the\n\nservices and if the pension is shared with spouses they also access services\n If they took their money and left having retired that benefit is\n\nno longer theirs\n But I think we all know there are many many breaches of that\n People show up and get attended\n We are trying to regularize that one the same committee is looking\n\nat that and the request for data which has gone out to all prospective staff\n\nmembers is really an attempt to create a database which is alive and accurate\n\nand to plug some of those loopholes because we are losing money\n\n<$E>  Let me just clarify\n You don't have to be on full pension to be a part of the pension\n\nscheme\n You can be on part-time pension\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$E>  Currently no\n\n<$Y> \n I can't figure out why the discrimination to even if they are\n\ncontributors to the scheme\n\n<$E>  Those persons who have taken the full amount their basis of\n\nsettlement is far different from persons who have taken pension from the\n\nUniversity\n\n<$Z> \n They are no longer an employee or connected to the University in\n\nany way\n Although you have made that choice the University can according to\n\nthe Blue Book determine whether you get the cash or not\n\n<$Y> \n I am making an argument\n\nhere that persons who are leaving the institution and feel it is\n\nnecessary to use their pension take their money in lump sum make arrangement\n\nto go and invest it in something to keep them alive having spent forty years\n\nin the institution\n\n<$E>  The argument is if you take for example five per cent pension\n\nas you are entitled to in the service\n That is why I hate the point made that some sort of\n This is explained to persons when they leave before they leave\n\n<$Z> \n If you make a clean break you make a clean break\n\n\n<$A>  It didn't look so good\n I am not clear on what your constraints are\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  But total what\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  There is a lot of talk about wage guidelines up and down the\n\ncountryside\n The talk about Social Contract and that sort of thing but as I\n\nunderstand it there is talk about being able to keep up with the cost of\n\nliving\n We have seen that even if we forget what we have lost over the\n\npast times gone there is no way that your offer could keep us on target for\n\nthe week with the cost of living\n Even with the most optimistic projections of the Jamaican\n\nGovernment at the moment and we have a calculation here and we have heard\n\nsome offers on your side about single digit inflation which is even more\n\nfar-fetched than what we were told the last time\n The last time it was one per cent per month but be that as it may\n\nwe have studied the last twenty years Jamaican experience and only in five of\n\nthose years was single digit achieved and in only one of those years did\n\ninflation go below six per cent\n Indeed and in fact in only two of those years sorry three of those\n\nyears did inflation go below seven and a half per cent and there weren't many\n\nyears when it went below twelve per cent\n Years one two three four five years in which inflation went below\n\ntwelve and a half per cent so that ignoring the fact that we have lost some\n\neighty per cent and more if we just put that behind us and say okay forget\n\nabout that eighty per cent your offer doesn't hold out any prospect of\n\nkeeping us in striking distance with inflation\n Last time we were offered one per cent a month and things went a\n\nlittle more than that talking about over thirty per cent like twenty-seven\n\nper cent and twenty-eight per cent as opposed to twelve thirteen per cent\n So that I mean just applying a simple rule\n If you are going single digit this time that is your story you are\n\ntelling us prudence would tell us to expect twenty out of twenty in which\n\ncase we are definitely falling behind so that it is not clear to me\n If there is talk out there about maintaining so forget the past\n\nand look to the future I don't know if this is the kind of thinking that is\n\nguiding you or you have a bag of money spreading over an area of the ground\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  It is not clear to me what is your constraint\n If your constraint is single digit you seem to have come up a\n\nlittle short of is your constraint that you have been given X  million\n\ndollars\n\n\n<$Z> \n I just thought we would take a little break and think through some\n\nof the things you were saying and we just want to make a point that in\n\nputting our position on the table we have done so as fully as it's possible\n\nfor us to do\n We don't want to give the impression that we have something else\n\nholding on to\n That is the amount that we have to offer beyond that we really\n\ndon't have\n And though I can understand the dissatisfactions and almost\n\ndisbelief we want to hasten to assure you that nothing that we are doing is\n\nintended to be confrontational\n That is not going to get any of us anywhere\n We would like to see this process worked out as quickly as we\n\npossibly can but we can only make the offer within the constraints that we\n\nhave to make those offers and it would be dishonest of us to latch on to any\n\nsuggestion that somebody makes and say well we think we are in a position to\n\nmove from here to there and are not in a position to vary where we are\n\n<$A>  The tenor of the last remark you made is that you are not\n\nnegotiating that is that\n We are negotiating then with some unseen force\n Obviously if you are negotiating with us you are under constraints\n\nbut if your constraints are such that you are merely a tape recorder or a\n\npost box then that is not a negotiation\n So the nature of my remarks before you took a break were seeking\n\nto find out what is the nature of the constraints you are under\n\n<$Z> \n I think the items we have looked at in the eighteen Item Claim in\n\nsome way or other indicate the cost and we accept this but we knew that if we\n\ndon't address wages there is always the impossibility of the ability to pay\n\nhas to be on the line and from our directive that is the basis on which we\n\nhave to operate\n\n<$A>  to pay\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  So in other words you are not constrained by any percentage\n\nor any guidelines as rumored\n\n<$Z> \n I had promised not to get into argument about guidelines in my own\n\nprofession that has been completed in the Social Contract\n\n\n<$A>  So you are not constrained by the Social Contract in your\n\noffers\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  It was an offer constrained by ability to\n\npay\n\n<$A>  You see there seems to be generally speaking within the\n\nindustrial climate some notion that wages should stay in relation to future\n\nincreases to inflation\n The question therefore of the first year of the contract as it has\n\nalways been is really a question of catching up of what you have lost in the\n\nprevious contract\n Now we are in the difficult position where we negotiate a\n\nthree-year contract and given the very uncertain state of the Jamaican\n\neconomy and of its politics for that matter as we have seen over the last few\n\ndays it is hard to negotiate a three-year contract where we don't see any\n\nprinciple\n We don't see any underlining principle in the way you are\n\nnegotiating the contract\n Now if the contract is saying that if your offer is really saying\n\nthat or we would have to interpret your contract in one of two ways\n If you are saying that you are expecting the rate of inflation to\n\nhold to seven and a half and six per cent in the last two years of the\n\ncontract or you are saying that you expect inflation to be ten or twelve per\n\ncent or whatever it is but we can't expect to keep up in this time\n So that what we are saying is okay you have made a calculation you\n\nhave made a projection as to where inflation is going\n Now is it possible that that rate of inflation may turn out to be\n\ntrue all the better for all of us\n If your projection is seven and a half per cent and we are getting\n\na seven and a half per cent increase then basically we are being compensated\n\nfor future inflation\n If the future inflation is really ten per cent if that is your\n\nprojection and you are offering a seven and a half per cent you are really\n\noffering seventy-five per cent of the inflation so we are to fall back\n\ntwenty-five per cent each year\n So where we really have a difficulty with that sort of approach is\n\nthat in the past we have been given a projection of twelve and a half and we\n\nhave experienced let us be fair two years of twelve and a half and we\n\nexperienced twenty-six point seven and twenty-eight\n Now I don't think that is reasonable\n So the point is okay let us assume inflation is going to seven and\n\na half and you offer seven and a half that means that there must

to you we want  one hundred\n\nand eighty-five per cent increase and you are going to say unreasonable tough\n\nluck  in ability to pay forget the past and look at the future\n We are back on that same scenario again\nis coming to is let us for the\n\nmoment not pay much attention to the first year because that is a moot point\n We need eighty per cent and you have offered us twelve and a half\n\nit is really eighty-two so you are seventy per cent behind at the moment\n Then now you are going to offer seven and a half in a context\n\nwhere the best case scenario from speaking with the Minister you say single\n\ndigit the best case is nine\n So we already are losing one and a half and probably two and a\n\nhalf but when the Minister says single digit at nine we are not expecting\n\nunder eighteen\n This is from past experience\n So that when you come back in the third one and you are going down\n\nto six per cent that is very ambitious\n And when is the election\n But in election year we know that certain things need to ease up\n\nbecause money have to spend a lot of money and given the state that the\n\nGovernment is in you have to spend a lot of money after its recent decision\n\nin relation to Colonel  Smith and come nineteen ninety-eight to stay\n\nin power we expect a very high rate of inflation so that you are putting us\n\nin an impossible position\n You are dropping us seventy per cent short on the catch up and\n\nyou are not offering us any comfort in years to come\n So that you see you need to come back to us and say either you\n\nare giving us a reasonable catch up and then you say well you get a little\n\ntop up and you fall behind but you are still within target or you say take a\n\nbreak on the beginning and we are going to give you some kind of guarantee\n\nfor the last two years of the contract that if the percentage falls behind a\n\ncertain amount either we get a seventy-five per cent inflation above an\n\nagreed target or we get point for point increase above increased salary or\n\nany such arrangement\n said we want to look at all flexibility a\n\npoint I want to make in previous negotiations

a\n\nMona Allowance\n We introduced a Mona Allowance which was thirty per cent of our\n\nsalary\n Come to another negotiation we say okay you have a twenty per cent\n\nHousing Allowance and you have a ten per cent Rent\n If you live in a University house give us thirty per cent Housing\n\nand if you live in the house you drop the rent we have had to come up with\n\nall manner of ways flexibility to come to this settlement\n In the case of parity we went and had a signed letter from the\n\nPermanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance Financial Secretary so that we\n\nare flexible\n We even have some reservoir of creativity\n is coming up with new ideas constantly\n We are willing to negotiate any kind of way but one of the things\n\nwe need to know is what are your constraint\n What I know is you are under no constraints from the percentage\n\nguidelines\n One year we accepted fifteen fifteen fifteen which was the wage\n\nguideline\n Another year wage guideline we got the Mona allowance\n Everything was fine I M F World Bank everything was fine and us too\n\nbecause we got our money\n You are not operating under any percentage guideline certain\n\nmonetary constraints relating to ability to pay so that if that is the\n\nsituation we would like you to get a mandate for some flexibility in relation\n\nto how you can deal with this monetary situation and in the proposals that\n\n Frank has made if we have indexation at the end I mean if this\n\nindexation it is that is not a cost for this triennium it is a cost that has\n\nto be met in a later time period\n Anything we negotiate in one three-year period we have to take it\n\ninto account when we come back for the next three-year period\n So that we are going to be back here again in three years time\n When I say we WIGUT\n mouth\n So anyway I think the message you should get from us is that really\n\nyour offer just can\'t spin\n It\'s just not in the ball park\n It neither has principle nor capability\n It\'s neither in the spirit of these negotiations that have been\n\ngoing on for years nor is it so loaded with cash that we are willing to\n\nignore our principles and sell them out\n So you are not buying out our principles and there is nothing in it\n\nthat is in keeping with principles that have guided these negotiation all\n\nalong which is to ensure that we do not ever again slip back into the\n\nsituation where we slipped once already\n But let us assume how much effort on the part of the Jamaican\n\nGovernment they got us back up to a certain point\n If we slip again with the best will in the world Jamaican\n\nGovernment is not going to easily be in a position barring the discovery of\n\noil or some other windfall\n The Jamaican Government is not going to be in a position to rescue\n\nyou\n You are now going to kiss University education goodbye in Jamaica\n It means that the notion of a high-quality University locally in\n\nJamaica is going to be that is the last chance on the fiftieth Anniversary of\n\nthe establishment of U W I what the Government of Jamaica would have decided\n\nis effectively the dream of Mona from nineteen eighty-four is over\n Let us just forget about it\n Let us just be a second rate international community college and\n\nthe consequences for human resources in the context where everybody agrees\n\nthat the most important issue in development is human resources\n People like me have been saying this for years\n Even the World Bank recognizes that now\n So that I mean you really have put the negotiation in a very\n\ndifficult position because there is nothing in your position that allows us\n\nto come to an agreement\n So that we would appeal to you to go back and see if you can and I\n\nam sure we can try to persuade  Jim to restrain his members\n I wouldn\'t like to see negotiations break down again\n It is traditional to have a break down and we have fulfilled that\n\nobligation\n Last time we went to Ministry of Labor for the first time and I\n\ndon\'t know if we have to do that as well\n We are willing to go through the rituals if necessary but you are\n\nthe one to say all along that you want a quick settlement and as you always\n\nsay we are not professional negotiators\n Every hour I spend here is an hour out of my research time which is\n\nmy promotion if you are delayed\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  So we have no desire to drag out the negotiation\n When you look at it I am an Economist this is costing the\n\nCaribbean to have this quality man power going through this kind of ritual to\n\nhave expensive meeting\n You can imagine our charge out rates\n\n<$Z> \n I think that we would be stupid not to pay attention to what you\n\nsay\n You talk about loading\n I didn\'t hear you say eighteen months or six months or whatever\n\nand I am sure if you get into that kind of discussion\n\n<$A>  you are jumping the\n\ngun\n You are going a little too far\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  We are just taking the course taking it step by step\n We have not got to that stage\n We are at the stage where we want a reasonable offer then you\n\nstart negotiating\n Our concern is that your offer neither has money nor commitment to\n\nprinciple\n\n<$Z> \n Where we are at is there are a couple of issues raised which seem\n\non this side as avenues to be explored\n\n<$A>  The avenues I want you to explore sir are principle of\n\nmaintaining the University in terms of backing indexing\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  But at the same time we cannot ignore front end\n You are seventy per cent out at the beginning so I don\'t want you\n\nto misunderstand\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  but this\n\nis a man who resigned in the last negotiation\n Is after we get the increase he came back but my fear now is at\n\nthe end of this agreement Alister is going to resign and there is no way to\n\nget him back and he is just a symbol of what we are facing\n Things are bad in Jamaica\n We are aggressive but within the University they are able to\n\nrecruit people like I O B\n They don\'t seem to be recruiting Professors but my department so\n\nthe problem is not the environment\n\n<$Y> \n It is not crime that is the problem it is the pay\n\n\n<$Z> \n We would like to just revisit the whole position and bearing in\n\nmind the comments that you have made I guess it is not finished until the\n\npaper work is done\n\n\n<$X> \n We obviously would want to give you time to use your persuasive\n\npowers to really try and get the kind of flexibility that would make the\n\nnegotiation meaningful\n The question is how much time we need\n We stand to meet as soon as negotiation makes sense\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  All monies currently in\n\naccount for spouse and children shall be made available to the relevant staff\n\nmember\n Now the principle on which we are making the change now is that we\n\nhave been moving in this direction for a long time\n Study and Travel should really go to the member because it is for\n\nresearch\n Now if we are taking this principle into account now what it means\n\nis that we would want any money that is allocated to study and travel to go\n\nto the member\n Now some of us are in the situation whereby on the last occasion\n\nwe took study and travel grant but we have not taken study and travel grant\n\nrecently\n If some money left over on account for us which is not for us but\n\nit is for our spouses and children okay\n So there are two alternatives either the next time we go on study\n\nand travel we would collect that money if we took spouses and children with\n\nus\n The alternative is which is more in keeping with the principles\n\nthat we are establishing with the negotiation is that whatever back money\n\nexists it should go entirely to the member so that it would not be costing\n\nthe University any more\n It would just mean that instead of having to carry family with you\n\non the next occasion to get your back money you would get the back money\n\nanyway and you do more research\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  I am trying to avoid carrying my family\n It has no cost to the University\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  We are not saying that people who were not entitled to it\n\npreviously should now be entitled to it\n We are saying how do we allocate what we are entitled to already\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  So we can sign off on the first sentence\n\n<$Z> \n The first sentence we had agreed with that\n It is just the second sentence that we need to look on\n We need to discuss with our members because there are some things\n\nI am not clear on\n\n<$X> \n They are signing off on the first sentence which says that the\n\ncurrent allocation to member spouse and three children be allocated in full\n\nto each member regardless of family status\n\n<$Z> \n Which was the original claim and we agreed to that but the\n\nextension of that claim we are not sure of so we have to look at it\n\n<$A>  You see whenever we change the laws we always have to decide\n\nwhat happens to the balances\n When you are changing policies you have to decide what you do in\n\nthe carry- over period\n So we realize this is new\n\n<$Z> \n We have to address that\n\n\n<$X> \n Item Number nine Acting Allowance\n Persons required to act in posts above their substantive\n\npost for more than twenty-eight days will be given a formal

at\n\nthe bottom of the higher scale the person shall move to the closest point\n\nabove their current salary and shall then receive one increment\n All allowances associated with the higher post grade will be paid\n\nto the acting appointee\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Z> \n closest point above their\n\ncurrent salary scale\n\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  No he wants to clarify the

their current salary\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  So they would move up one increment\n\n<$B>  I don\'t think this captures what you are saying\n\n<$A>  Equal to or above\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  Yes\n They shall be placed at the closest point above\n\n<$C>  And shall be placed at one increment above\n\n<$B>  You mean a lateral move\n\n<$A>  Shall be paid one increment\n\n<$C>  May I ask a question\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$C>  Just for clarification\n I just wanted to know if what I am understanding here is that the\n\nperson will be moved one increment at least one increment above\n That is really what we are saying\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$C>  It may be one increment and a little piece\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$C>  Well then the wording perhaps we need to put in something\n\nhere after  move  at least one increment above\n\n<$A>  We don\'t mind that at all\n That would allow for two and three\n\n<$C>  What I hear you saying is not just the piece of increment\n\nthat there may be but if you leave what you have here it may be that the\n\nperson moves two increments\n\n<$B>  That is not really what we are saying\n It could be interpreted that way\n\n<$A>  We could spell it out further sir to say\n Should be placed at\n\nthe same point in the new scale which is equal to the current salary or the\n\nnext point above\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$C>  What we want is not less than one increment\n\n<$Z> \n The salary is that close that you could move to the higher grade\n\nat the same salary\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$C>  So you want no less than one increment\n\n<$A>  We don\'t have any problem with that\n\n<$Z> \n I thought we had agreed that acting appointment gets no more than\n\none increment\n\n<$C>  no less than one\n\nincrement\n\n<$Z> \n I don\'t know what the semantics are\n\n\n<$A>  Shall move to a point in the new scale which is no\n\nless than one complete increment above\n\n<$D>  An increment is an increment\n It cannot be complete\n\n<$C>  If we say just one increment wouldn\'t that cover it\n\n<$Z> \n I thought so\n You remember the last time they were saying the person might be\n\nat a level where it is less than an increment and we said we would move to\n\nthe next increment and then get one\n\n<$A>  At least one complete increment\n You could give me the increment on my old salary and that is not\n\n<$C>  He says one complete increment\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$C>  just say\n\n one complete increment in the scale\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$B> Shall be placed at a point in the\n\nnew scale which is equal to their current salaries plural or the next one\n\nabove and shall then receive one increment\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$C>  It is clumsy\n\n<$A>  It is clumsy but it is precise\n\n<$B>  in cases where the\n\nappointee\'s and that is singular but we have salaries\n\n In cases where the

{'text': '<$A>  The point is being made that a Head of Department might for his\n\nown information his memoir whatever made little jottings about you know some\n\ndiscussion that took place or whatever if that person intends to use that\n\nmaterial at any time it then would become an official document which the\n\nmember of staff would then have to see before it comes to one of the official\n\nfiles of the University\n is saying\n\ncould not be included in all inclusive statement that you have here\n That is my understanding\n So I would put in the word " official" before\n\npersonal files and I would put a full stop at various locations\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  All\n\npersonal files shall be available for examination on location at the request\n\nof the Union member\n\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$A>  Well I have just defined what I am saying the files that can\n\nbe used that can be presented and used as Mr  Connery defined it quite\n\nwell\n We have differentiated here between such records as the University\n\nwill claim as official records and such records that an individual keeps as\n\nhis own personal memoir and which if he chooses to use it can only be used if\n\nit becomes an official record which very well needs to be signed by the\n\nperson\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$B>  So what are the official files now\n Can we have a listing of the official files\n\n<$A>  Those I know about there is a Registry file and a Bursary\n\nfile\n\n<$B>  But there is another one\n\n<$C>  What is usually referred to as a personal file is the one\n\nkept in the filing room which is accessible to all users in the\n\nadministration\n There is a confidential file on staff members\n Well your staff is represented\n They are all kept in the appointment section or within the office\n\nof administration for certain level of staff\n So those are the two critical files and which certainly are\n\nofficial files\n Now the question arises and here being part of our discussion on\n\nthis side was that we wanted to consult with the Deans and Heads of\n\nDepartments just to find out what really happens on the ground there because\n\nif there is some concern coming in a way by the University Registrar that\n\nnothing in any of those files unless they were moved over to the two files\n\nthat I have just mentioned that is my reading of the situation could be used\n\nagainst or for staff members because they are not on the official file\n So I think we need to ask the question and answer whether there\n\nare some files in the  Office or the Department Head\'s Office\n\nwhich are at present status could become official files\n I don\'t think so but I think it is something that needs to be\n\nclarified\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$X> \n No no I am just saying for your information that a file on each\n\nindividual staff member is kept certainly in our department and I have known\n\nfor example at Faculty Assessment and Promotion Sub-Committee that a Head\n\nwill arrive at such a meeting with a file that says I support or don\'t\n\nsupport X or Y\n We have this and that change inter-change and so forth and refers\n\nto that file a support for his or her recommendation\n So what I am saying is that even below the level of which you are\n\noperating those files are used and in fact copies of documents in a sense\n\nsupports the Head\'s decision in the circumstances and I would consider that\n\nas an official file too\n\n<$A>  And those documents are used without the person\'s knowledge\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  But then it should cover that by reminding the Faculty\n\nCommittees about the regulation that we agreed to in the previous agreement\n\nthat nothing should be used by\n All that needs to be done that should be observed it should be\n\nenforced\n\n<$Y> \n It is like the constitution and laws coming out of the\n\nconstitution this is what we are trying to do here\n\n<$A>  But I think that the Dean should ensure that if a document is\n\ncirculated that it has been endorsed as seen\n\n<$B>  You see those files would have to be considered official\n\nfiles files in the department files in the  Office or the\n\nappropriate places wherever library or Bursary or what have you\n Because what you are saying there is the possibility of\n\ntransferring the letter later on\n is my Head of Department right and he writes this\n\naide memoir so to speak about me of all the devious things I did\n Four years later this letter is now going to be transferred so it\n\nis going to be transferred and at that stage I am going to see the letter but\n\nof course all the memory all the supporting information that I need to carry\n\nto refute his claim is no longer there\n Maybe my colleague knows what he is saying is not true and has\n\nsubsequently left the University\n So I don\'t think you can avoid saying that\n Certainly in my Department there is a file on every member of\n\nstaff and I assume that in most Departments there is a file on every member\n\nof staff and given the increased or the more central role that Heads and\n\nDeans are going to play under the new system obviously the files on the Heads\n\nand Deans would have to be considered official files\n It is a different thing if the Head has a file that he keeps in\n\nhis own filing cabinet in his room\n\n<$C>  That\'s part of the issue you see\n He can keep the filing cabinet in his room\n\n<$B>  No no but nothing ever kept in his filing cabinet in his room\n\ncan ever become part of the official document\n\n<$A>  May I make a point\n\n<$B>  The only time it becomes a part of the official document is\n\nthe time when he puts it on the file\n Now we don\'t insist that we see his file that he keeps in his room\n\nor his study at home right but the point is that if he keeps such a file\n\nthose documents can never be used unless at the time when they were put there\n They have to be put on the official file\n\n<$A>  May I just point out that I am supposed to be guardian of the\n\nrecords of the University\n If those records are official documents of the University and I\n\ndon\'t have access to them the documents you are referring to then I don\'t see\n\nhow they could be called official records of the University\n Until they come in our central recording system\n\n<$W> \n I am talking from reality now\n Those files have been used against members at the appropriate\n\ntime\n\n<$A>  Well I am not denying that\n I am saying let us find a way to ensure that that doesn\'t happen\n The way you are proposing then is that the records of the\n\ndepartment which have been used and brought forward now be declared official\n\ndocuments of the University\n Well systems would have to be put in place then for the movement\n\nof those records into the availability to those who are held responsible for\n\nthose records of the University like myself Mr  Bond and other people\n I don\'t have any control over those documents\n I don\'t know anything about them\n In fact you\'re telling us that they are used and I am saying what\n\nwe know what comes to us in Assessment which is the big concern that comes to\n\nus in Assessment are considered the official documents and those are what we\n\nexpect to have seen by persons\n If people make their own notes and refer to it in explaining\n\nthings I think they are entitled to that\n If they are going to use it as a document which comes and goes up\n\nto Committees and passes it up then it ought to be seen by people\n You are now querying what are the official records of the\n\nUniversity\n\n<$X> \n I would have said myself that any record kept by an officer of the\n\nUniversity which is going to be used for the official function of that person\n\n<$A>  That\'s right\n\n<$X>  And that would include Department of Faculty records\n I mean the point I am making I as Head of the Department keep a\n\nfile on a member of staff and will refer to that file because the classic\n\nthing that happens you get exchange of letters between a staff member and a\n\nHead\n It doesn\'t involve anybody over here\n I am not\n\nrecommending so and so for promotion because I wrote him or her about so and\n\nso and he wrote back and said X Y and Z\n\n<$A>  Only when it comes to that point that it becomes an official\n\nrecord and at that point\n\n<$X> \n But there is a difficulty\n For example a new Head will inherit stuff written by an old Head\n\nand maybe this is her opinion on that\n I am saying is it an issue as long as the thing is going to be\n\nused it should have been treated in a particular way at the time when the\n\ndocument was made\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$X> \n Yes they are inherited\n I am saying the files were there from the last Head and they were\n\nthere from the last time I was there and they are there right and it is\n\neminently unfair after all the stuffs have been written the people never had\n\na chance to have access to them\n I am saying it is an official record because the Head does use it\n\nto evaluate the staff member\n In fact how else would I evaluate staff members than referring to\n\nwhatever may have been written by the previous Head of Department\n\n<$C>  At the point when you attempt to evaluate the staff member it\n\nwould be a critical document and if you pull on various things your own\n\nexperience what people tell you your knowledge then you write up something\n\nwhich becomes an important document in the assessment process\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$C>  I am referring to the staff member and most likely to the\n\nUniversity\n\n<$X> \n had\n\nbeen coming late to classes and I am now using that\n didn\'t have a\n\nchance to respond\n Even if I attempt at this point to get him to respond to the thing\n\nwhich was five years ago he has no evidence no proof\n I am saying for it to be usable it has to go through the process\n\nat the point\n\n<$C>  But strictly speaking in terms of industrial relations\n\npractices and what is fair to employees you ought not to be writing something\n\nabout  Fred coming late unless you have drawn it to his attention four\n\nyears down the road when it occurred\n you are not coming\n\nto class on time and then you put it in writing\n You cannot pull it out at some point and say I have it on document\n\nhere\n You would have had to write him about that you see\n You would be\n\n<$W> \n I think you know that in reality it doesn\'t go so\n And if I may add possibly on the management side they have not\n\nreally been vigilant on these matters as they should have been\n This is an issue which is on the table now\n You find in instances you always find allegations being made and\n\nindividuals being surprised by Nicodemus operation\n I am surprised\n I never knew this before\n\n The problem is really it is because these things were not\n\naddressed in the areas where they should have been addressed and now we have\n\nto decide once and for all\n And even and I want to stress this even when these things are\n\nagreed to when they are not done when in fact occasions will come up and\n\nmembers will contend that this was not copied to me I have never seen this\n\nwhat is done about it\n Nothing is done\n So our position is there is only one way to settle it\n\nunfortunately is to have it here now\n\n<$A>  Don\'t say nothing has ever been done\n The time I have been here we have sent back assessments to be\n\nre-done because of that being brought to our attention\n So you know things have been sent back and apparently the whole\n\nprocess has to start again\n\n<$X> \n The problem is that sufficient number of cases that come to our\n\nattention have slipped through the system and what we are saying is we want\n\nsomething which has guarantee\n You see the problem is that you may sent out to Deans and Heads\n\nand tell them that they ought to do X Y and Z\n\n\n<$B>  The point here is that we are operating at different levels\n\nand in our system the recommendation of a Head of Department can be a very\n\nimportant thing and it is going to become more important under the new system\n\nwhether at the Faculty level or at the higher levels and if the Heads are\n\noperating based on files which the members don\'t have access to then that is\n\nnot an acceptable situation\n Now the Heads and Deans are heads of the University so their\n\nfiles are official files\n I mean you can\'t prevent somebody keeping a person\'s file\n\nanywhere they want to keep it and you can\'t prevent them from bringing up ten\n\nyears ago some allegation but once it appears once it comes up right once it\n\nis to be used in an official committee of any sort be the Faculty\n\nSub-Committee on a subject or be in relation to our annual assessments which\n\nare going to come up now\n Whatever it is then the member must have access to it\n So that I see at the time once the report is made I don\'t see any\n\ndifficulty in the notion of the official personal file but we have to know\n\nwhat we are talking about\n It seems that we are talking about the confidential file personal\n\nfile and any file that is held by Heads of Section Department or by our Deans\n\n<$C> \n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Z> \n I think we agreed that there is need to re-define the wording\n When it comes to that we need to talk to the Deans and Heads to\n\nget a clear understanding of what type of documentation they are keeping and\n\nhow that documentation will be used\n We are not at variance\n We are not saying that we don\'t agree with it\n I think we just need to come up with a wording that we all can\n\nlive with\n\n<$A>  I have proposed that by putting in the word "\n\nofficial" in front of  personal that that will cover\n\nit\n It is just for us now to know what is official\n\n<$B>  Once we have that we need to know which file is official\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B>  We need to define directly what is an official file\n The thing is it has to be water tight because the file itself it\n\nis not just whether the fellow passes the files to the next Head\n Once the person keeps the files as Head of the Department it is\n\nan official file\n\n<$Z> \n\n Do you mean no materials which would affect the member\'s\n\nappraisal not just any material not a statement from the bank or whatever\n You just mean no materials that are relevant to somebody\'s\n\nperformance or appraisal\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Z> \n We understand we just need to fine tune what is an official\n\nfile\n\n<$X> \n There are certain key things that we are concerned about\n\n\nofficial\n\n<$B>  Why don\'t we try and refer it to the local level as we used\n\nto\n Let us get a direct inter-facing with the Registrar\n In between negotiations we could have a meeting with the\n\nRegistrar just to finalize the wording to see if we can come up with a\n\nwording outside of the negotiation\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Z> \n No problem\n We understand the spirit and we are on for what you are trying to\n\ndo\n\n<$B>  Is that okay\n\n<$C>  We are talking with who\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$B>  We don\'t have a problem with who you want to bring so to\n\nspeak but there is no reason why the Minister of Finance people should be\n\noppressed by such discussions\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$C>  would be involved in this also\n\n<$B>  I don\'t think so\n Between this meeting and the next meeting let the University\n\npeople try and come up with a draft where we can place on the table and Mr\n\n Connery can have a look at it or the people from the Civil Service\n\ncan look at it to see if it resonates what they hope to achieve and then we\n\ncome to an agreement\n But I think we need to do some more thinking on this\n\n<$A>  you raised a point but I didn\'t hear a\n\nresponse to it about whether the material which goes in there\n\n<$Z> \n Yes at the second paragraph because the first one is the one that\n\nis giving the problem\n No materials shall be placed in the member\'s\n\nfile\n\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$X> \n Then there is the Discipline Grievance Procedure\n This one was actually agreed to when last we were here but the\n\nwording was to be done\n I mean just in case we might need to put in an "\n\na" or so\n\n<$C>  There is an S that is missing in the fourth line from the\n\nbottom  fail it should be " fails"\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$X> \n Changes in the Blue Book to be negotiated by December thirty-one\n\nnineteen ninety-six\n\n<$A>  The end of Academic Year\n May I just make another point\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  Remember now it is now in our interest to wait until the\n\nconsolidation period of the ordinances and statutes take place to reflect the\n\nconcerns which are being fed back on the different ordinances\n Wouldn\'t it be useful to wait until the academic year to have\n\nthis done and completed by the end of the academic year\n\n<$X>', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '98800d9d-daa7-4653-bb0a-d54df6e0e43e', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:52.307920+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9856460690498352,

{'text': "<$A>  Sir I am a little flabbergasted as to how you are saying that\n\nyou expected us to come with a response to your offer\n We responded clearly at the last negotiation and we handed a letter\n\nto the Principal on Monday in which we had a general meeting with the members\n\nand the members expressed their anger at the offer\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  What is that\n\n<$X> \n That was not in the heat of the moment that was a very short\n\nmeeting\n\n<$A>  It was a long meeting\n The meeting took too long as far as I am concerned\n and I spoke at great length at the last meeting\n\nabout the whole history of negotiations and the types of ways in which\n\ndeadlocks could be broken and so on and so forth\n So I don't know how you can come here\n I mean it seems very strange that you have come here now to say\n\nyou did not know we were rejecting the offer\n I don't understand that\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  No no\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$A>  I don't understand\n I mean you came to the first meeting and you offered us something\n\nand  Rupert said it was ridiculous\n\n\nRupert said it was ridiculous and you come to this meeting and now tell\n\nus that you don't know that we rejected the offer\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  I don't understand that\n There were two specific things that we raised in rejecting the\n\noffer\n which\n\nis  what is the basis of your offer\n You have never stated what is the basis of your offer within the\n\ncontext of a mutual commitment on both sides towards an international\n\ncompetitive salary which has had a particular manifestation in the past\n\ncentered around the parity issue\n And the other point which is the\n I raised the question of whether you are operating under\n\npercentage guidelines or whether you are operating under a flexible sum of\n\nmoney\n What are your constraints\n That is the second issue we raised\n The third issue we raised had to do with the question of what\n\nflexibility do you have\n I mean we are willing to accept a MONA Allowance again\n We are willing to go any of the routes we have gone in the past\n We have spelt out all the routes we have gone in the past but we\n\nclearly rejected the offer\n I mean you can consult your records and we said we wanted to hear\n\nfrom you what is the basis of your offer\n What was the constraints you are operating on and what was your\n\nlevel of flexibility\n So we would like to hear those three points spelt out now\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  Let me just make one last point\n When we spoke to the Minister of Finance on the last occasion he\n\nsaid that he was not willing to have us negotiate directly with the Jamaican\n\nGovernment which is essentially what we were doing previously\n That what was going to happen is that he was going to give the\n\nUniversity a certain sum of money and tell the University management to do\n\nwhatever they think best to do with it\n Now in a sense part of what we are asking you is that the current\n\nsituation\n Are we in a new situation\n If we are in a new situation then it appears that the Jamaican\n\nGovernment is not living up to its commitment and the Minister given the\n\npressures he is under he has forgotten his commitment\n We need to know\n We have always come to an agreement with the University on how we\n\nshould negotiate\n As I was explaining to the Principal once we negotiated with the\n\nUniversity directly and the University in good faith signed an agreement\n\napparently with WIGUT and when the University went to the Government U G C\n\nthey said  we never tell you to offer that kind of money to those\n\nfellows\n And after that negotiation we always said we wanted to negotiate\n\nwith U G C U W I negotiating team which we did for many years and every\n\noccasion whenever an agreement was signed there was this level of commitment\n\nthat comes in\n We didn't have trouble\n Sometimes we had trouble it bothered us when we got to the end of\n\nthe day but that was a different issue we didn't have any problems with\n\nnegotiating procedures\n It seems to me that you guys are operating under wage guidelines\n\nin a context where we are supposed to be operating in a negotiation between\n\nmanagement and Union\n So are we negotiating with the Jamaican Government in disguise or\n\nare we negotiating with the University of the West Indies\n We need to clarify what is the negotiating procedure here\n We can't just dance around the issue we want to know what is the\n\nbasis on which we are negotiating\n If you are merely telling us what the Minister tells you to tell\n\nus well tell us that\n It means perhaps we have to negotiate with the Minister directly\n\nthen\n He said he didn't want to see us again\n I don't know\n Three points sir the basis of your offer\n The constraints of your negotiation and the flexibility\n\n<$X> \n We had indicated at the outset that the bottom line was going to\n\nbe what the owners are prepared to put up to pay wages\n It is not a matter of signing a contract and then take it to the\n\nMinistry and the Ministry says I didn't give you that authority\n We would not want that to happen again\n If the owners of the purse determines that this is what they can\n\nafford in terms of compensation\n\n<$A>  Stick a pin sir what exactly does that mean\n Now that is what we want to know\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  A percentage offer or a quantum of money\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  A band of what\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  It is a percentage offer\n So we are not negotiating there is no negotiation\n\n<$X> \n Well you asked how we got there\n Now the band could be this wide or this wide\n The fact is we did not start somewhere and then come little little\n\n\n<$A>  So you could offer us twenty-six per cent in Year One and\n\nzero zero\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$X> \n I hear you but I am saying perhaps one of the things that we might\n\nwell have done is to separate salaries and deal with salaries different from\n\nallowances\n\n<$A>  In what sense\n\n<$X> \n I am just thinking\n Because what we did we came in with an offer of X per cent on\n\nsalaries and certain allowances which we link together Entertainment\n\nTransportation and Housing as salaries\n Now maybe another way if we had flexibility we are talking\n\nflexibility might be able to treat all that differently\n\n<$A>  That is not reaching very far\n\n<$X> \n I don't know it might who to tell because if you get on the rocks\n\nyou need to do something different\n But you asked what our mandate was and our mandate was this is as\n\nmuch as we are authorised to offer\n\n<$A>  You are saying that your mandate is to offer twelve and a\n\nhalf per cent in Year One and seven and a half per cent in Year Two and six\n\nper cent we are not negotiating then\n That is not a negotiation\n says he does not\n\nwant to see us\n Maybe he is long to see us\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  So what flexibility you have for us\n Flexibility we are talking about\n Explain this allowance versus salary flexibility\n Because allowance and salary cost nearly the same amount of money\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  For how long\n Like a fifteen minute break\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Z> \n Can I ask through the Chair what differences did you expect\n\nbetween the last negotiation and this one\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$Z> \n I just wanted to ask him based on his basis of understanding\n I am not talking about figures\n\n\n<$A>  There are three questions we asked at the last meeting which\n\nwas the philosophical basis of the negotiation\n Two was under what constraints you are negotiating and what\n\nflexibility you had and of course the most important question is the one \n\nRupert was going to say\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  How much more you are offering us\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  What you think these people are here for\n You think they like to see your faces\n They have to come to hear what you are offering\n Are they staying or are they leaving\n Are they to go and send out their C Vs and so\n\nforth\n\n<$A>  You said you were going to come back with an earlier date on\n\nthat\n\n<$B>  I noted that you were not happy with the date\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  No\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  You still have not given us an offer on the leave\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$A>  Let us go through\n\n<$Y> \n We kind of working in order\n We had asked for an automatic annual increment and you said\n\nbasically\n We were given some arguments and you agreed I think to think\n\nabout it again\n\n<$B>  We had discussed that at length actually since our meeting\n\nwith you certainly to try and get a fuller understanding and a better picture\n\nas to what happens in that area and we had mandated the University Registrar\n\nand I apologise for her departure because she left before the break because\n\nshe has another engagement\n She passed on to me the outcome of discussions she had with the\n\nVice-Chancellor subsequently to the meeting we had on this side and what had\n\nemerged from that discussion with the Vice-Chancellor is that the Personnel\n\nGroup is the only one where an assessment has been done to date before the\n\nincrement is granted and that in the new order that is the direction in which\n\nthe University is moving\n That is not an issue before us now but I think we understand that\n\nand the business of more assessment more evaluation tying that in with an\n\nincrement or an increment is the direction\n I am reporting to you what she has said\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$B>  I am merely giving you my understanding of the discussion\n\nwith the Vice- Chancellor\n The view therefore and this was set in an international context\n\nthat the direction in which systems procedures internationally are moving\n\nparticularly in the context of the University\n The Vice-Chancellor's suggestion therefore is that if there is to\n\nbe an equalizing of the approach which is in fact one of the points made by\n\nWIGUT then it would be toward what is to come and towards the trend that is\n\nnow developing namely that there be assessment at all levels so that the\n\nincrement would be applied when somebody has a good assessment\n So it would be seen as a retrograde step to take the Professors\n\nout of that kind of assessment which they have been leading the whole\n\napproach on\n So any change would be to bring everybody into the assessment by\n\nthe increment\n That is what came out of the\n\nmeeting\n\n<$B>  Well we are reporting that there is no progress\n We have not received anything\n\n<$A>  We don't expect that\n\n<$B>  This matter is entirely out of our hands but certainly we\n\nwill convey to the appropriate authority\n\n<$A>  It can't be out of your hands you know Tony\n\n<$B>  We will convey that\n\n<$A>  You have the University people there\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$A>  You have a new date on Optical and Dental\n\n<$B>  The issue here\n Let me just remind members here Mr Chairman that we have a\n\npractical difficulty here\n One of the key members of this sub-committee who is looking at\n\nthe Dental and Optical possibly providers is the Director of Health Services\n\nwho has been away and will return at the beginning of October\n So we really didn't want to commit to the end of October first of\n\nNovember and not being able to deliver\n We wanted to give ourselves a little more room in which to sort\n\nout the whole thing and bring a reasonable proposal to WIGUT <Y> \n I am sure you will know the normal speed in which the University\n\nproceeds on matters like that wouldn't really allow us to give you that kind\n\nof loose deadline\n\n<$B>  It is not loose\n The end of November is not loose\n We have a deadline for the thirtieth of\n\nNovember\n\n<$B>  We are understanding what you are saying\n\n<$W> \n\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Y> \n The thing will be given\n\n\n<$A>  What I am saying you must try to find a way around that\n\ndifficulty\n The whole health service is difficult with grave concern\n You know our side has been really reasonable on this issue you\n\nknow\n Negotiation after negotiation you come back and say let us meet\n\nwith unions and that sort of thing\n It does not work\n\n\nbeing away\n the\n\ncemetery is full of indispensable people when he was insisting that\n\neverybody retired at sixty-five\n absence\n\n<$B>  It is next week we are talking about\n\n<$A>  You know how things are running over the Health Centre\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  Redundancy as you have correctly reiterated is about posts\n\nand not people right\n That is whereby we have had redundancies in the past at U W I in\n\ncase of the Classics Department\n The Classic Department was closed\n Now when the Classic Department was closed there was a member of\n\nstaff who was I assumed he was a temporary member of staff I might be wrong a\n\nten year member of staff in that post\n What the University did what we expected them to do was to give\n\nthis member of staff the opportunity for retraining\n So as classics wound down this member of staff requalified\n\nhimself in management studies and is now a lecturer in Management Studies\n So that when we talk about retraining which is presently in the\n\nnew ordinances this is exactly what we mean\n If the post of Campus Registrar was made redundant we would\n\nexpect the University to give the incumbent officer A sufficient notice and B\n\nan opportunity to qualify\n\n<$X> \n Sorry\n We are not arguing the retraining\n\n\n<$A>  You are not arguing that\n You accept that\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  We come to the next point\n Away from that happening away from where a specific post or a\n\nwhole group of posts become redundant let us say for example our computer\n\npeople", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b978b70c-bfa2-4e50-a3ca-2d8d8adbb530', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:52.309663+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9857192635536194,

{'text': "<$A>  Let us say the University by itself outscores computing for\n\nexample and closes down all the computing operations in other words they have\n\ndecided to privatize so to speak\n In that situation the University gets all computer people redundant\n\nokay\n Now in that case all of them in our view will be given the\n\nopportunity for example if positions were available to retrain to become\n\nlecturers in computer science or mathematics or management studie or anywhere\n\nelse\n That is how we understand retraining\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  Where the problem arises is where you have the Economics\n\nDepartment now which has let us say twenty posts and you are going to declare\n\nfive of these redundant\n That is you are going to say five posts in the Economic Department\n\nand cut\n Now when you declare five posts cut we are saying that in that\n\nsituation since none of us are assigned to any particular job or task within\n\nthe Department what is the principle on which you are going to cut those five\n\nstaff that is the question and that cannot be arbitrary it cannot be\n\ndiscretionary it must be base on principle of redundancy because it is an\n\nexercise in redundancy it is not an exercise in assessing each member of\n\nstaff and deciding who management likes and how management don't like\n The reason people are in that situation is based on the redundancy\n\nwhere less posts are available for the twenty people\n Now we are saying in that particular instance that we are\n\nproposing some principle base on which we get rid of these five people\n Now it is not clear what you're saying in response to that because\n\nin your presentation before you begin to shift over from post to person and\n\nwho management want to get rid of and want to see the back of and so\n\nforth\n\n<$B>  May I just say initially notice has been take on this\n One possibility is to front load the University's subvention out\n\nof the normal project fund loan then for eighty million dollars which\n\nhopefully I think we can invest and the returns from the investment initially\n\nwill expand the pool\n It will also take them off or reduce the dependency on commercial\n\nbank resources which are higher rates and hopefully this subsidy that is the\n\namount between the actual interest rates that you can pay and the real\n\ninterest rates that subsidy could represent\n I don't want to call it savings because when I look at the\n\nUniversity's budget I don't really see a line item in there for subsidy for\n\nmotor car loan and I have been doing the University's budget for the last\n God knows how long\n So it is not really a saving to them but it is really a case where\n\nthey would not have to be putting out this money from their own pockets but\n\nthey are competing along this line that is the essential thing\n\n<$A>  We are flexible we can't explore anything until we have it on\n\nthe table that is where it is\n\n<$B>  It may be required\n\n<$A>  The other thing you see on the loan thing we have an\n\nagreement in place and it has not been implemented consumption loan for car\n\nloan for house and so forth\n So whatever you agree on with the University it is going to be so\n\nfine tuned into our agreement that at the end of the day it just slip away\n\nfrom us and in the past so many things we didn't have sabbatical leave\n\nbecause the savings could not be found\n So we have lost on consumption loan because we were told there is\n\nno money and so forth\n We are willing to consider and it has to be written down in a way\n\nthat it is not just a matter of management's discretion at the end of the day\n We want to resolve the loan situation because the loan situation\n\nhas not been proceeding as we have agreed across the table\n We have an interest in resolving the loan situation and of course\n\nwe have an interest in the University of not subsidizing the bank\n\n<$B>  Surely and it may require the coming together of the main\n\nplayers working out the plan for that individual going to the bank X bank Y\n\nbank working out an individual arrangement to determine the stronger position\n\nas against the other situations in which you go with a block of business and\n\nyou would be more able to negotiate a stronger point\n It also gives the University some sense of what is the exposure at\n\nany point in time\n\n<$A>  It has to be settled across the table it cannot leave this\n\nnegotiation\n Our experience is that we are back here in three years without an\n\nagreement\n We are flexible we would want to see your proposal on the table\n\nsee plan B between now and tomorrow\n It must be a smaller group outside at the end of the day when we\n\nhave to sign off on those things\n\n<$Y> \n Are there any other things you have left out you went through the\n\nwhole list\n\n<$X> \n Number eight increased allowances for Deans and Heads of\n\nDepartments\n You had said that there was some proposals being considered in\n\nrespect of referral position there has not been any\n I don't have a further position on that yet that is still an\n\noutstanding item\n\n<$Y> \n Just to clarify two things\n Is there a recognition on your side that the package on the Deans\n\nhas to come here for approval\n\n<$X> \n I have heard that repeatedly so that almost continues because your\n\nposition is that the Deans are only on referral position for four years\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Y> \n Should be members of WIGUT\n Most of the positions of Deans referral positions Heads of\n\nDepartment Professors and so on these are also included in the bargaining\n\nunit the members of senior administrative and academic staff are excluded by\n\nname not positions\n Campus Registrar and Deans are not excluded\n So what we are saying they are on leave\n they are members when they come back and so on and so forth\n We are saying that the position of Dean is a position that we\n\nnegotiate for and therefore a package for the Deans had to come to this table\n\n\n<$C>  I just want to ask WIGUT whether\n I know your position is and has always been and correctly the\n\nposition the University Committee has given on the matter\n My question is specifically whether WIGUT will be willing to\n\nnegotiate that point\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$C>  Separate and apart from the package which is a representation\n\nyou know it is an issue\n\n<$Y> \n Even the issue of negotiating our way our representation requires\n\nthat you recognise that we represent them\n What I am trying to say is that step number one\n What we are saying of course and we expect you to say as well that\n\nwe represent them and as long as you say that we can talk\n\n<$C>  We don't know\n It is not what happens\n\n<$Y> \n Where we go from here at this particular point it is very\n\ndependent on what you say\n The point is that as long as there is recognition and acceptance\n\non your part that it is an item that whatever procedure that you go about to\n\nconsult develop a package for Deans members are very anxious\n What I am saying is very simple that the position of Deans is one\n\nthat is part of our bargaining unit\n As long as that is accepted on both sides we can have all kinds of\n\ndiscussions but that has to be accepted\n\n\n<$A>  I can speak for the team over there at the Mona Campus\n\nbecause of certain background things but I wish to say to you that there is\n\nabsolutely no question because the document exist that Deans are recognised\n\nas members of WIGUT's bargaining unit so that there is absolutely no dispute\n This is a matter that will stand up in the Ministry of Labour and\n\nit is a matter that will stand up in the Courts until any recognition of that\n\nposition\n That is the position\n\n<$B>  The point I was going to make is simple\n Usually a bargaining unit is clearly defined so it is somewhere\n\naround the place in some documents it is\n\ndefined\n\n<$C>  If I might just ask for some clarification\n The proposal as it stands is that if the staff member is required\n\nto work one Saturday in the year the person would be five-thousand dollars\n\neach month of the year\n\n<$Y> \n For that category of staff that is required to work on Saturday\n It is the category\n It means the University may be able to call on them any Saturday\n\nyou are in a category it means you can't plan for your Saturdays any more\n\neven though there are two three or four Saturdays in the year\n\n<$C>  Or one or none at all\n\n<$Y> \n The point is management can call on that person to work on a\n\nSaturday any Saturday some Saturdays all Saturdays\n\n<$C>  Again for clarification\n has to do with\n\nexigencies of the Service\n I think you guys are familiar on that side I know with the term\n Required to\n\nwork the persons here    are required to\n\nwork on a Saturday for example nobody tries to tell them they have to\n\nwork on a Saturday they just know they are required to work on a Saturday\n a month as Occupational Hazard and that has to\n\ndo with in the exigency of the Service\n Required to work on\n\nSaturday\n Nobody tells them they have to work on Saturday they just know\n\nthey are just required to work on Saturday\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$C>  No no being a person that you represent\n Of course you don't represent us but you represent others who are\n\nrequired to work on a Saturday because that is the only way they would be\n\nable to keep abreast or try to at their work\n at\n\neight thirty we have a meeting or we have to open somewhere in the Library or\n\nwhatever it takes\n I am just trying to understand it is not a signal of an agreement\n\nor anything but I am just trying to understand what it takes to claim this\n\nkind of thing\n\n<$Y> \n Let us say you originally agree to a work week of five days a week\n\neight hours a day and it means therefore that anybody in order to perform\n\ntheir regular duties have to come outside of that time arrangements have to\n\nbe made and we have made a proposal for Saturday\n The law takes care of Sundays and Public Holidays no problem\n In other words the moment your side agreed five days a week eight\n\nhours a day a whole set of things come into play\n What we are saying is that anything outside of that time now that\n\nis not covered by the law is open for negotiation\n What we are saying for those occupational staff pay them a flat\n\nrate of five-thousand dollars a month that's it\n Their duty is as such that they have to come in in order to\n\nproperly carry out their function\n\n\n<$C>  Would it be like the Transportation Allowance\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$C>  Where it is paid across-the-board to a category\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$D>  The base is that they come to work because they have extra\n\nwork to do or it is mandatory that they come to work\n You need to clarify\n I don't think that this allowance can be paid to the person who\n\ncomes to work voluntarily as against someone who comes to work as a mandatory\n\nrequirement\n\n<$Y> \n Okay my comment would be that obviously the person who is told\n\nyou have to come is covered\n I would ask you sir the other categories have to be covered\n\nbecause the work load is such that it is accepted that this cannot be managed\n\nproperly except by coming to work on a Saturday that person too has to be\n\ncovered by it\n\n<$D>  I can understand if it is mandatory for them to come to work\n\non Saturday\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$B>  How it works Monday to Friday normally eight thirty to five\n\nbut in practice and exigency but that wouldn't come up very often you are\n\nasked to work until ten twelve all two in the morning and on Sundays you can\n\nget call out\n\n<$A>  I think the people lower down they get a Honorarium base on\n\nhours of work\n\n<$D>  It has to be an average of ten hours per week for you to\n\nqualify\n\n<$A>  Ten hours of extra work\n\n<$D>  Yes\n\n<$B>  After five o'clock\n\n<$A> \n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  It is a bad principle\n What is wrong with us being granted that outside of when you do\n\nyour work\n The notion of the Vice Chancellor here it is a very wrong notion\n The Vice Chancellor have six weeks he tend to go wherever he\n\nwants to go he knows management have work until they die it is a wrong\n\napproach all together\n It is destroying our institution because it means that people who\n\nwhen they are on the job constantly they have no time for break and they have\n\nno time for reduce themselves\n It becomes a very bad reflection on the institution and a bad\n\neffect on the society on a whole\n You have no time to interact with your family or neighbour or\n\ncolleagues or friends and it is a really bad effect\n\n<$X> \n to\n\nwork\n\n<$A>  We want to discourage this system because I can tell you the\n\nentire University is base on the principle that people have to work Saturdays\n\nSundays and public holidays and late at nights\n We want to find a system\n There is no reason why the Budget Office in the Ministry of\n\nFinance they have a complement of staff which is of such they have to do\n\ntheir job timely\n What is wrong with our society one third of the people are\n\nunemployed one third are over worked and the other third don't give a damn\n We need to break down that situation and stop over working the\n\npeople at the top\n So that this notion that you had put forward that no one at the\n\ntop in the institution gets over time is the basic bad principle on which the\n\ncountry is run\n It means that the people at the top should get as much leave as\n\nthe people in the middle and the bottom\n When last you had leave\n\n<$B>  Nineteen-ninety-two\n\n<$A>  Ninety-two\n We want to move away from this situation we don't want to\n\nencourage the University to believe that you can have people working in and\n\nout it reduces productivity\n\n<$B>  It is true\n The point I was trying to raise our thinking is what happens in\n\ninstances where you have a peak period long hours\n This is the point I make at other places and may it is for other\n\ndiscussions but I will just mention it here you said this is subject of a\n\nresearch\n I still have a concern that the wider society is not benefiting\n\nfrom the finding of that kind of research we need to market it out there\n\n<$Y> \n Two points\n First of all we have query what is your response to our proposal\n\n\nrequired to work okay then we will see how we respond to that\n On the quantum don't even bother to prorate the five- thousand\n\ndollars a month if we are negotiating let us see what you mean by \n\nrequired all right\n\n<$C>  We have one further difficulty as we move along\n Your clarifying statement in one of your letters from your\n\nPresident which requires them to be available for work on Saturday are as\n\nRegistrar for example or Principal available to work on Saturday required\n\nthem three times or four times or five times\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$C>  We go back to the question that I raised the\n\nacross-the-board for all those persons who might be called out might be asked\n\nto come they are required to be available certainly for work on a Saturday\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$C>  Yes but we don't expect to tell them Friday night we don't\n\nusually do that", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': '<$A>  The other thing you have groups here you said Senior\n\nAdministrative and Library Staff\n As far as I am aware there are special arrangements in place for\n\nLibrary Staff the Senior Library Staff because the Library is a service in an\n\neducational institution so the library has to be open on Saturday the opening\n\nhours are long can be in the night and so on so they have a shift roster and\n\nso on\n So if people who work on a Saturday they get a day off the following\n\nweek or some other time it is a well oiled kind of machinery that they\n\nnormally find well and it works\n\n<$B>  Whether these people in the Library would receive that benefit\n\nis that the question you are asking\n\n<$A>  Yes because they are included in there they are mentioned here\n\nin the clarification and I am not sure that that was deliberate\n\n<$B>  It is unusual Library staff are working\n\n<$A>  They get a day off\n In addition to that they have an arrangement in place that is the\n\npoint I am making\n\n<$B>  Yes that was the idea\n They are working unsociable times\n\n<$A>  The type of compensation and so on\n\n<$B>  It was in\n I am not talking about the Bursary staff who might be called out to\n\nwork on a Saturday\n The Library staff are required to work one Saturday every month or\n\nwhatever it is\n\n<$A>  Yes they are required to work\n\n<$B>  So this is a compensation for having an unsociable job\n I won\'t get into academics but they don\'t have to work Saturdays\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Y> \n Right\n\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$B>  Library and Science people\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$B>  Saturday is not the same\n The Librarian successfully block that one\n The point is what the Librarian wanted to do was to introduce\n\nSaturday as a normal work day so that the Library could conduct all its\n\nfunctions from Monday to Saturday\n What we agreed was that they could get skeleton staff on Saturday\n\nso that the staff that comes out would be a much reduced than the staff that\n\ncomes out Monday to Friday\n\n<$X> \n How many days the skeleton staff work from Monday to Saturday or\n\nTuesday to Saturday or they work five days between Monday and Saturday\n\n<$B>  Five days\n\n<$X> \n Five days\n\n\n<$B>  But they get a premium for having to work on Saturday this is\n\nwhat the break is\n this is what negotiation is about\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$A>  In addition to whatever other arrangement is in place for\n\nthem\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A>  In place of\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$X> \n Everybody works on that kind of shift that requires them to work\n\nfive days because it obviously has certain things that flow from it that \n\n  we need to look at\n\n\n<$B>  Not a double benefit it is over time not a double benefit\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$B>  You work over time if you work on Saturday\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$B>  People who work overtime they don\'t work single time they\n\ntime and a half\n\n<$B>  What are you saying on the Readers\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Chairman just to say with respect to the point to what extent\n\nwould it satisfy what you are asking for that is the procedures involved\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$A>  I don\'t think in the presentation which I made from actual\n\nformal letter that the University Registrar had sent to me base on her\n\ndiscussions with the Vice Chancellor she had left the room by then and I more\n\nor less quoted from what she had written to me that did not go into the\n\nquestion of procedure the procedures are fairly simple\n As I understand them is that the Vice Chancellor obtains a\n\nrecommendation or seeks for a recommendation from the Campus Principal on the\n\nparticular member of staff and I assume that the Principal would in fact\n\nconsult with the Deans or whoever would be relating to that particular staff\n\nmember\n And it is that advice recommendation that goes to the Vice\n\nChancellor and on the basis on which he takes a decision concerning the\n\nincrement increment is not the right word it is a band or moving to another\n\npoint to the band that he is adding something to the salary\n\n<$Y> \n You notice what you have done\n You said in that letter the specific thing that is concrete\n What you have said is that the Vice Chancellor consulted with the\n\nCampus Principal beyond there you are guessing\n\n<$A>  That is very strong\n\n<$Y> \n Yes\n So without getting any further into it a procedure cannot be\n\npresumed so there is an absence of procedure it is an absence of transparency\n\nhow the devil on earth even the Campus Principal knows what are presented to\n\nus particularly given the fact that the transparency would not apply to\n\nanybody closer to the Professors\n So what we are trying to say clearly if you call it a procedure it\n\nis a procedure that is exceedingly unsatisfactory it is total non-transparent\n\nbecause in fact you\'re asking two very remote people the Vice Chancellor and\n\nthe Campus Principal who don\'t know what them to know about me a total\n\nnondescript\n\n<$A>  I missed out an important point I have just been reminded of\n\nwhich we had raised this with the University Registrar prior to our last\n\nmeeting\n Our understanding is that staff member the Professor is actually\n\nasked for a submission about his work his C V whatever he wants to say\n\nconcerning the good things he has been doing public service and committee\n\nwork research publication and teaching and so on that goes through the Campus\n\nPrincipal for some kind of endorsement and then on to the Vice Chancellor\n Mr Chairman what I would suggest what I would think might be\n\nsuitable at least for the first move or another move is to actually get this\n\nquite clearly documented and then we would bring that information and discuss\n\nit with you\n\n<$Y> \n The Vacation and Study Leave\n You are offering two weeks in the year that study leave is taken\n In that regard I would just like to raise another point which is a\n\nwhole lot of accumulating particularly the administrative staff they\n\naccumulated leave which they ended up losing\n So we are proposing the possibility of leave buy back arrangement\n\nafter three years of accumulated leave\n\n<$A>  Leave by what agreement\n\n<$Y> \n Leave buy back agreement money in lieu of leave which accumulated\n\nstaff should have taken but which could not be taken because of the exigency\n\nof the service\n\n<$A>  We are introducing this under the overall vacation leave it\n\njust come up as we studied that that in reality there is leave which we\n\naccumulated in fact which was lost by our members because they can\'t take it\n\nand we are proposing to you the possibility of a leave buy back arrangement\n\nwhere we get money in lieu of leave accumulated after three years\n\n<$X> \n I have to share a sentiment expressed by one of your members that\n\nleave is something that should be encouraged\n\n<$Y> \n I have no problem with that\n The only thing therefore on your side is if you could arrange for\n\nour members to take their leave they don\'t want to buy it back but they are\n\nlosing it the key thing is that they are losing it and since they are losing\n\nit we want them to enjoy the monetary thing\n\n<$B>  You want to give them an incentive give them the leave\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Y> \n How does it work in the Civil Service when you accumulate\n\nleave\n\n<$C>  You are allowed an accumulation for three years period of\n\nthirty-five days without permission then if you can\'t go off after three\n\nyears you apply for the leave somebody says sorry but in exigency of the\n\nService does not allow you to go off\n We ask permission for you to accumulate you are therefore allowed\n\nto accumulate leave up to a maximum of another two years\n So basically after five years of leave then you can buy back\n\n<$D>  That is earned above the three years\n\n<$C>  A hundred and five and seventy days a hundred and\n\nseventy-five days\n\n<$B>  Do you have anything written down\n\n<$D>  It is written in the Staff Orders\n\n<$C>  We don\'t have a difficulty with the employers\n\n<$A>  Just for clarity Mr Chairman and just to remind the other\n\nside that that leave is not entirely lost at present\n You are aware of because it is accumulated for a very rainy day\n\nwhen the money is needed at that time\n Fifty per cent of your leave is taken at retirement it is\n\navailable\n\n<$B>  What happens when you retire you get back that money for\n\nleave\n\n<$D>  No when you go on retirement you take your leave you are not\n\npaid for leave you go on pre-retirement leave to a maximum of one year\n I should also say for your study purposes we use up fifty per cent\n\nof all your leave but you get back at the end of that study period a half of\n\nwhat you actually utilized as vacation\n\n<$E>  Fifty per cent of vacation leave\n\n<$C>  It is first charged to whatever vacation leave you are\n\nentitled to\n\n<$C>  I thought we were trying to get around that by using some\n\nwording definition of " official" and that would cover\n\nwherever they are held\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$C>  Then the location would not be a problem would that satisfy\n\n<$B>  We have to define what is official\n\n<$C>  What files are official wherever they are held once they\n\nfall within that category those are the ones you are talking about\n\n<$A> \n\nofficial it gives a lot of difficulty really\n Certainly what we had in mind the group that met WIGUT and the\n\nUniversity\n Yesterday when we interviewed persons who are Heads of Department\n\nor has been a Head of Department and also Deans and his experience and we\n\nspoke to other people too as to what happens in the Department and at the\n\nFaculty level and what he reported and it seems to be the common result is\n\nthat in the department there will be a personal file on each member of staff\n\nwho he represents and that we certainly well at the Faculty level there is\n\nnot likely to be a file on each staff member\n There might be exchange of correspondence between a Dean and a\n\nHead of Department about some staff member some other kind of composite file\n\nthe critical ones are certainly those in the offices of the Heads of\n\nDepartment but there might be in the Deans Offices also\n The thing is that the Head could keep some note on a staff member\n\nwhich he has in some file in his drawer so we looked at all of them and we\n\nreached a position where we are saying that if we wanted to tie this thing\n\ndown let us say that he took down some notes about an individual staff member\n\nand kept it in a drawer by his bed that certainly is not an official file\n\nneither is it a booklet file which is not regarded as a personnel file in the\n\nDepartment on the staff member\n You can see that there are difficulties in how you define what is\n\nan official file so we went the route of\n There has to be in the Department some file on the staff member\n\nand that certainly would be the one such file we regard as official and there\n\nhas to be in the University and Campus Registry some kind of official file on\n\nthe staff member\n Incidentally we are not aware of an office called Appointment and\n\nPromotion so we would not want to go with the inclusion of that office but\n\ncertainly the University Registry and Campus Registry if you want to include\n\nthat there would be no problem with that at all\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$A>  We are not aware of the existence of an Appointments and\n\nPromotions Office\n In other words the umbrella term is University Registry Campus\n\nRegistry would cover\n What I think they are getting at there is an Appointments Office\n\nor Promotions Office they do that kind of business but University and Campus\n\nRegistry would embrace those areas because the appointment section is a part\n\nof the Registry\n\n<$C>  I still have a concern\n I thought we would be getting to a state where official would be\n\ndeemed to be such files that the contents of which can impact on the staff\n\nmember negatively or positively whichever\n So that the one which the Head of Department or whoever would\n\ntake home I would possibly prefer to call it a glossary\n In other words I was hoping that we had gotten to the stage where\n\na set of files on which is going to be entered anything that impacts on the\n\nstaff member and copies of which will be sent to the staff member to have him\n\nsign\n\n<$A>  The second and third paragraph would illuminate the point\n\nyou are leading to and maybe that should be read and then we take back your\n\npoint Mr  Green because I think light is drawn under those issues if\n\nyou read the second and third paragraphs\n\n<$Y> \n Can we save time we are kind of press for time\n I was going to suggest could we arrange for two officers to meet\n\nat local level because one option clearly arising is the possibility of\n\nhaving a definition of " official" which I think we have a\n\nproposed wording\n If we can delete all wording in that and apply it to a definition\n\nmaybe that is what we should mandate the people at the local level to do\n The very last thing was Changes in the Blue Book\n\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$Y> \n You are proposing academic year you know we can\'t accept that one\n\n\n<$A>  With due respect the calendar year concept and the Blue Book\n\ngiven the fact that the Blue Book will not be ready\n\n<$B>  We have a proposal\n\n<$Y> \n All non-Campus and consolidation\n\nmatters be settled by the thirty-first of December nineteen ninety-six and\n\nall remaining matters to be settled no later than two weeks after Council\n\nmeets in April nineteen ninety- seven\n\n<$B>  You understand the concept there\n\n<$A>  I understand what you are saying\n\n<$B>  was that with\n\nthe example for consolidation which ended on the thirty-first of December as\n\nlast time but would have to be ratified by Council meeting untidy matters\n What we are saying any matter that does not relate to this\n\nproblem of consolidation should be able to be settled by the thirty-first of\n\nDecember\n\n<$A>  How do we know all the matters which relate to consolidation\n\n<$B>  We can deal with that in a meeting\n If you are saying that the consolidation matters but\n\nconsolidation ends on thirty-first of December\n\n<$A>  Yes and such matters if you try negotiating and discussing\n\nwithout knowing what the consolidation is going to be\n\n<$B>  But it has nothing to do with consolidation\n In other words we are meeting now so that we can wrap up by the\n\nthirty-first of December\n When we see where consolidation takes us on the thirty-first of\n\nDecember we will continue wrapping up base on the assumption that the Council\n\nwill approve what the Vice Chancellor said but when we see the actual Council\n\ndocument we might have to make some adjustments but we want to keep the thing\n\nvery tight', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '72afe584-a48e-4715-a011-6d147995b98b', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:52.313096+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': "<$A>  We really should have mentioned this from the last meeting but\n\nI don't know why I thought no I would talk to the group first because I\n\nrecall very clearly when I was a member of staff at what is now Utech and\n\nnegotiating on behalf of that group we were constantly reminded by the\n\nGovernment that the University of the West Indies was a specialist\n\ninstitution that we could not seek to compare ourselves with the University\n\nof the West Indies\n The University was at least a regional institution and the least\n\nthat the Government could do was to conceive the U W I in regional terms as\n\nwell as international terms\n So local organizations were not entertained when they started to\n\ntalk about comparing themselves with U W I\n So it is a little difficult to hear the story being reversed now and\n\nsuddenly the University is being placed in a local context conveniently we\n\nare being positioned in a local contextoff-the-record-discussion\n\n<$Z> \n So that essentially the underlying spirit of our package and what I\n\nhave also done is to outline areas where we can discuss in respect to what we\n\nhave agreed on and so on\n\n<$B>  Just to clarify the word of official position who was from the\n\nMinistry of Finance\n\n<$A>  That was the time of Doctor Marshalleck\n\n<$C>  She was from the Ministry of the Public Service and not\n\nMinistry of Finance\n Not that it makes a difference but just for the record\n\n<$A>  We just want to reinforce to strengthen our claim to\n\ninternational competitiveness the validities\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$B>  In many forums\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$C>  I have a query on that same one\n You said this is part of the salary and should go to August\n\nnineteen ninety-seven\n What will happen from August nineteen ninety-six\n\n<$Z> \n Between August nineteen ninety-six this particular quantum or sum\n\nidentified instructional technology allowance will become available to\n\nmembers of staff for example we have a book grant where you can purchase\n\nbooks and claim on that book grant\n We have to submit bills it is not given to you\n In fact we have informally discussed it with the University and in\n\na sense the University might actually raise the books and things like\n\ncomputers\n\n\n<$C>  Year one is the sort of bridge that you use in the\n\ninstructional technology allowance to salary increase\n\n<$Z> \n In year one right\n What we are saying in exchange we are financing from our pay\n\npackage what your side should be doing for us in order to function\n\neffectively\n\n<$C>  I don't think so that is not it\n Isn't the part right now the cost right here that the tax dollar\n\nwill have to come up with you are financing it\n\n<$B>  It should not come at this negotiation\n The point is one of the difficulties we have at U W I is not our\n\nunion it is other unions as well\n We are negotiating beyond what is normally within the purview of a\n\ntrade union negotiation\n There are other items that are greatly inadequate within the\n\nUniversity but we have always refused to bring them to the table\n Office space for example you come to a negotiation and say every\n\nmember should have an office that is in a sense devaluing our negotiations\n Now in any University of our standing internationally which is the\n\ncriteria we are being judged for promotion the University provides you with a\n\ncertain level of technology\n When you arrive and you go in the office you have a computer\n\nwaiting on you\n We are saying that this should come out of some other budget but\n\nwe have to be dragging this out of you in this budget this should be fund\n\nmoney we should be negotiating for\n\n<$C>  Unfortunately Thursday and Friday of this week we are going\n\nto be in this very room\n I am going to be looking at the University's budget for the next\n\nbiennium\n It is something that I have been doing since may about nineteen\n\neighty-four far too long and each time there is a line item they call\n\nteaching and research material\n So what I am gathering is that what is not provided there or what\n\nwe have provided there will be in addition to whatever is provided in the\n\nwage negotiation\n If we can put this here on the negotiating table when properly it\n\nbelong on the Biennium Estimates of the University that item is going to come\n\nup\n\n<$D>  Let me just make a point\n That item Teaching and Research like chemical chalks papers things\n\nlike that\n\n<$C>  There is a whole range of things covered by the term and\n\nthere is nothing that says a computer cannot be included in this\n\n<$D>  No we have\n\n<$C>  We have not seen any such thing\n\n<$B>  As a matter of fact chalk is under-strained paper cannot be\n\nbought and chemicals\n You are talking about a whole year without ordering chemicals in\n\nthe Chemistry Department\n\n<$C>  I will definitely be constrained if that is an issue in the\n\nnegotiation\n When we are looking at the Budget I will be constrained hey look I\n\nsee this item coming up elsewhere as a claim and we can't provide for the two\n\nplaces we can't have the same claim submitted in two places\n\n<$Z> \n Can I just say this\n I happen to be Head of the Department and there is a heading for\n\nthe funding of the Department for teaching and research materials\n What it does it pays to buy paper it pays for servicing the\n\nphotocopier it pays for servicing the typewriters in the Department\n It pays basically and probably the biggest this is the paper and\n\nreproduction of handouts for students\n Now how could that possibly be turned around or converted into\n\nproviding a computer to each of our twelve member department\n\n<$C>  Okay fine\n So what you are actually saying is that you are negotiating here\n\nfor what you are not likely to get out of the University's regular budget\n\nbasically\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$C>  The two are linked\n\n<$D>  That line item is to do with the running of the department it\n\nhas nothing to do with the development of the individual\n This here is to do with the development of the individual\n That item teaching and research is the books in the library for\n\nstudents the chemicals that students use for their experiments\n\n<$C>  I thought the acquisition of the computer was for the\n\nenhancement of the department but you are telling me it is for the\n\ndevelopment of the individual\n\n<$D>  The development of the individual who in turn will impart\n\nthis increased knowledge to the students\n\n<$A>  I want to ask a question\n How does the material allowance given to teachers affect the fact\n\nthat the tools you get money for for buying chalk and books and so on how do\n\nyou handle it at that level\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  We are trying to get some sense as to what the annual demand\n\non this would be like\n has just got something he needs to put them\n\nin a format so that we can analyse them\n We need to get a sense as to in each year how many people\n\n<$E>  Looking at my notes your side was going to do something\n\nsimultaneously\n\n<$B>  I assure you we have done a lot of thinking and as soon as we\n\nhave received your proposal we have been working on this and we have some\n\nideas\n\n<$C>  Just a quick look at some of these\n Some of these are nineteen ninety-five for motor car\n It is reasonable to expect that somebody who has access to a motor\n\ncar loan in nineteen ninety-five would not necessarily need a loan in\n\nnineteen ninety-six or maybe nineteen ninety-seven\n We need to look at the sort of matching whether five or four years\n\nis a reasonable expectation\n We need to look at that\n\n<$D>  It might have haunted WIGUT and the eighty odd persons we\n\nhave recorded of accessing loans through us\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$D>  Totally through our loan scheme of the eighty something\n People might be buying cars and not coming to us so we can't\n\naccount for those people\n\n<$C>  What may be useful maybe is for us to look at a pattern over\n\na three year period maybe calculate the nineteen ninety-four ninety-five ones\n\n<$B>  It would be good you know if you want to look at a pattern to\n\ngo back and look at the pattern when we had a viable scheme because the\n\nscheme has really been non-viable for a number of years now\n\n<$C>  The demand could be greater than the actual loan\n\n<$B>  The other thing is with the fall in salary over the last\n\nthree years this has not meant for example I got a loan maybe in nineteen\n\nninety which I paid or nineteen ninety-one which I paid off this year but I\n\nam not immediately contemplating purchasing a car because I can't afford it\n\nso I have to move with what I have\n We need to bear this in mind when we look at the figures where we\n\nhave request demand really\n\n<$Z> \n The key thing is I would say at the moment you have a rough draft\n\nproposal we stand ready to convene members of a sub-committee with you\n\n<$B>  Sorry if you come up with a proposal even before the next\n\nnegotiating meeting we are willing to start discussion\n It doesn't have to come to the table so to speak but we have to\n\nhave a written proposal before we can respond to it\n\n<$E> s whether we seem to be in agreement about a\n\nsmall committee meeting could we identify because we can put something\n\ntogether information that we are looking for pretty soon\n\n<$Z> \n You have a proposal to put to that committee\n How many persons from your\n\nsideDiscussion-about-number-of-persons-for-small-committee\n\n<$Z> \n Through the regular meeting could we arrange for an early meeting\n\nnext week\n Item number two on our claim there is no additional action on that\n\nwe can't settle that\n Item number three on our claim about allowance for Professors and\n\nReaders\n I think you had made no new offer in relation to the Professors so\n\nwe any new offer from you on that one\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$Z> \n Particularly about the whole professor thing\n You had made an offer on the readers about two or three increments\n\nbut we made some arguments about Professors and you were suppose to report\n\nback\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$E>  We had further discussions with the University Registrar on\n\nthe matter of transparency and details of the system and we have asked for\n\nsomething in writing to describe just how it operates apparently if that has\n\nchanged\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$E>  Within something like that\n In recent times it coincides with some claims in his own office\n\nand so on and the Registrar is pretty involved with it now so we can expect\n\nto get something pretty shortly describing the process\n That is one element of what you're saying\n\n<$B>  In describing the process we have the same trouble you had\n\nsir\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$Z> \n The University Registrar who represents the section was here on\n\nseveral occasions when this matter was raised and didn't explain either it\n\nreally does underline the point that we are making\n\n\n<$B>  So at the next meeting we can expect to hear from the\n\nUniversity Registrar that is what we are hearing from you that the University\n\nRegistrar will outline thus\n\n<$E>  I am asking for that\n\n<$B>  Our concern is that we understand the University Registrar\n\nis part of your team so that in the course of the negotiation can we find out\n\nfrom her when we can get a response\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$B>  The next meeting is our seventh meeting and we still have\n\nnot gotten a response on this very simple claim\n We keep close record here and you know the biblical significance\n\nof seven\n It is about time we get a response\n We don't want to be meeting seven times seven\n\n<$Y> \n We hope to have for the next meeting it is something we have been\n\npursuing quite actively\n\n<$B>  You have something on the Readers\n\n<$Y> \n\n\n<$B>  It is going to be difficult to settle that given the special\n\ncircumstances of these\n\nnegotiations\n\n<$E>  Colleagues we have put a considerable amount of work on the\n\nOptical and Dental a considerable amount of work since our last negotiation\n\nmeeting and we are gathering data really from Pro-Vice-Chancellors having\n\nmoved away somewhat from a purely well some Dentists and Opticians outside\n\nand Optometrist and looking at a comparative way on dental and optical scheme\n\nthat will be provided by regular insurance companies\n So we have data from two presently and through our university\n\nbroker we are expecting to receive this week information from two others\n We have a working group looking at them and making comparison\n\nbetween the benefits and the premiums and that is where we are\n who\n\ndeals with administration\n\n<$Z> \n When can we do that because I assume again that something like\n\nthat you might want to have a working group to look at it before it comes to\n\nthe table I assume\n\n<$E>  Yes and importantly also I think you know there is a health\n\nservice committee on which all the unions on campus are represented because\n\nany scheme we are going to really want for it to be open to members of the\n\nuniversity through their unions negotiating with those unions\n There is no way we can by-pass that step of going to the\n\ncommittee and getting there with your representative being there\n There is approval and agreement\n\n<$Z> \n The one concern we would have of course we wouldn't want to have\n\nthis tied up in our quaint tripartite discussions between students unions and\n\nthe other two unions and as our acting President insists we are going to have\n\nto sign when we get up from this table we want an agreement which is not\n\nsomething that is okay to be discussed and signed off by forty other\n\npeople\n\n<$Y> \n I think we understand that position very clearly it is a sine qua\n\nnon but you must also understand that you can't enter into a health scheme\n\nproposal for one sector it has to be a complete thing you can't break up the\n\ntwo\n\n<$Z> \n But the key thing here is well just using the kind of saying that\n\nthe management job is to manage we are saying to you manage it so that you\n\ndeal with it always so we can get this agreement within a particular time\n\nframe\n\n<$Y> \n That is a big issue so what we need there is time regulation that\n\nis basically it and it is approaching the time and because we are getting\n\ndown to the wire you can't tear off a piece and leave it there that is not\n\nthe situation\n\n<$Z> \n Could we hear specifically therefore what are the procedures to\n\nbe proposed\n\n<$E>  The procedure would be that we will have scheduled a meeting\n\nfor next Tuesday of this working group based on the commitment Mr \n\nWashington have from the broker\n We will have a co-ordinator who represented us through the\n\ncomparison of the quotations and estimates that we had received well not\n\nestimates quotations from the four companies\n After that we want to call within a matter of a few days a\n\nmeeting of the health scheme services committee and I say again you are\n\nrepresented on that committee because it is as Mr  Watson had said it\n\nhas implication for just more than one category of employee on the campus\n Let me just say for your comfort too at least one of the other\n\nunions has made statements similar to your group that they don't intend to\n\nsign without this because of the fact that for a number of years now a\n\nproposal has been made that Optical be a part of this and base on this\n\nnothing has happened\n and myself have communicated to the\n\nmembers of the working group how very serious the President submitted his\n\ncase\n I think he left the last time no I think it was on another matter\n Anyway we are quite concerned about making a resolution\n We feel that out of the full Health Service Committee with your\n\nrepresentative being there we will arrive at a position which will be\n\nacceptable and fair", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

his\n\nmethods have assisted me to be far more analytical than I was before<,,>\n the presentations that have been made as Ronnie\n\nsaid are very diverse<,>\n really presented some of the\n\nevidence<,,> which makes community development difficult or impossible\n And I want to go back to it when I come to looking at policy issues\n\nand the implications in terms of policy development<,>\n A single thing that must be born in mind about the concept of\n\ncommunity development is that it is both a process and an end product<,>\n It is not something that actually exists\n the\n\nDrug Abuse will tell you that<,,>  <- > community \n\ncommunity has not yet developed and  \n\n the evidence of it is I think that it might if uhm<,> Mr Robinson\n\nwere to really record what have been the various stages that he has gone\n\nthrough in many organisations including the S V C because that's where I know\n\nhim from<,>\n\n\nin fact I think some of his skills that he has used in the community\n\ndevelopment process in    the uh N B A have been\n\ndrawn from those leadership kinds of seminars that he got  <,>\n\n in the S V C and other organizations\n\n\nFlankers    is a process<,>\n\nwhich a community has gone through including a lot of work which was done\n\npreviously through the community council that existed there and the\n\nactivities of the community council<,>\n a\n\nproduct that we're trying to achieve<,>\n But it is also a method\n\n\nw immediately begin to understand the various steps which were enunciated\n\nby the Drug Abuse uhm presentation<,>\n community is seen as the vehicle for achieving a\n\ndevelopment<,> and what we find is that<,> we have really gone through a\n\ncycle<,,>\n The prevalence of the method of community development is really\n\nbeing re-established having taken a nose-dive over a period of time<,>\n schools\n\nof thought which are now doing empirical research about how do you use the\n\ncommunity for projects and for larger programmes<,,>\n The real challenge is how do you create a community because you\n\ncan't assume that a community exists\n are specific\n\nrelationships which exist between people in a particular geographical\n\narea and you can have people living in a geographical area and yet you do not\n\nhave a community<,>\n of\n\nyour method is the extent to which you can build a community which\n\nsees itself as having a collective interest and therefore embarking on\n\ncollective goals<,,>\n because\n\ndevelopment especially in this scenario assumes a transfer of technology\n What is taking place between the Drug Abuse and the community is in\n\nfact a transfer of technology<,>\n I have confidence\n\nthat communities can manage themselves I think it would be erroneous    of us to assume that they automatically start off\n\nwith the tools to manage themselves<,>\n These are things which need to be acquired and the sustainability\n\nis going to come when the pioneering organisation has withdrawn and the\n\ncommunity is able to manage itself and to make a transition just from a drug\n\nabuse programme to a more holistic perspective in terms   \n\nof what is taking place in the community<,>\n I think the Drug Abuse intervention also isolates certain variables\n\nwhich are important    to the process of\n\ncommunity development\n One is that you have to start at a point of perceived need with\n\nwhich the community can identify and around which they can rally<,>\n\n\nthat is  that is automatic\n You know we have a myth in Jamaica that anybody can become a\n\ncommunity organizer\n at which many of the\n\nprofessional<,> community builders have had with the political directorate\n\nbecause there's a view that I can just take my political organiser and put\n\nhim in a community and he can become a community organiser<,>\n Apart from the fact that you then have partisan problems I think\n\nthe real issue relates to the methods and the processes  \n\n which are involved in community development\n Drug Abuse example\n\npoints out the need for stimulation but also the need for learning\n to have somebody there\n\nwho can carry the process forward\n\n thing\n\nthat    this example points out is the multifaceted\n\nnature of the community development process<,>\n\n\ncommunity development as the sort of last rung on the development\n\nladder and it's something that we resort to after we have fixed up everything\n\nelse<,,>\n one of the things about it is that the communities\n\nthemselves can lose interest very easily if they go through the stages as\n\nidentified here and this is a very young experiment yet\n are experiments which\n\nhave gone for twenty thirty years and there have been troughs and peaks in\n\nthe experiment\n\n\nthen the question is how does it make the transition to become more of a\n\npermanent sustainable body<,>\n In the first phase it is a fishbowl experiment\n Everybody is looking at it and seeing what it is doing\n\n\nsomething that they have to carry for themselves<,>\n an\n\nissue raised by Ben which I want to come back to<,>\n But it really is a dilemma as to the extent to which the experiment\n\nis horizontal<,>\n\n In other words can you deny that the state has to play a role in\n\ninstitutionalising some of those processes<,>\n\n\nbecause it was largely state-led\n a lot of emphasis on what\n\nthe state was going to do<,>\n the case of\n\nother community experiments<,> if there is not some kind of feeling that you\n\nare making a difference<,> and that it is not just about you but that you\n\nhave linkages with state institutions<,> then you are going to run into\n\nproblems because the experiment is going to stagnate<,>\n Now forming it into a legal institution is one aspect of it but I\n\nthink the larger question<,> of empowerment which is really to such a\n\nhackneyed phrase these days but the larger question of the community<,> being\n\nable to make a difference in terms of resource allocation<,> uh the community\n\nbeing it able to make a difference in terms of some of the things you said\n\nthe education policies that affect the community<,> it is going to need some\n\nvertical linkages<,>\n And it might be vertical linkages only with the local government\n\nbut it might be beyond that\n So that has always been a very vexed question\n nature of the\n\ninstitutional framework that you need to use to facilitate the process of\n\nsustaining the experiment beyond the fishbowl stage<,,>\n Uhm as I said before I think it's important that you should\n\nlegalise it but remember formalising it into a legal institution does not\n\ninstitutionalise it\n\n\nuhm relevant and sustainable\n And I think those are some of the things that you have to look\n\nat<,,>\n I already referred to the fact that I think that there's a\n\ntransitional stage that<,> community organisations go through from the period\n\nof formation to the period you know    to make it\n\nlasting<,>\n consistent with the method of empiricism which has been\n\nenunciated and embraced by Professor Stone I think one of the things that \n\n  some of these communities could\n\neffectively do is to begin to measure<,> on a sort of time frame what has\n\nhappened before what happened    in\n\nthe immediate period of the experiment and what is going to happen\n\nafter the sort of high point of the activity\n I think the achievements are monumental but as I say it's early\n\ndays yet and what you need to do is to determine how you make that transition\n\nso that it becomes a permanent feature of the community's life<,>\n\n\nhas had a foundation of it    as minimal as it might\n\nseem and my own thesis is that communities build on previous experiences and\n\nthat it takes a long time for you to see the manifestations of it\n if\n\nyou start now you probably won't see there is a kind of lag between\n\nwhat happens now and what happens twenty years\n And many organisations are going to be formed so it would be\n\ninteresting to do a sort of historical profile of  Flankers and to see\n\nhow it develops for us to learn more about how communities operate and how\n\ncommunity organisations operate<,,>\n takes me to Ben's presentation\n\nand I have already mentioned some aspects of it\n\n\nand<,> need for<,> some more focus in terms of rigorous thinking\n One of them has to do with I say the question of the centrality of\n\nthe state and what role does the state play in this and    to what extent do you have uhm horizontal\n\norganisations and what are the lateral organisations that are necessary to\n\nreinforce the horizontal organization\n What I found also a little contradictory is the question of the\n\nrole of the state\n\n\nthe whole rationale for community development is that we want to\n\nbuild more civil institutions<,> and that the government if you gonna do that\n\nyou can't have the government being in charge of everything and that you are\n\nstrengthen these civil institutions so that the community itself can become\n\nstrong<,>\n So I wasn't so sure about some of the uhm analyses that you made\n\nabout    the state\n Is the state just another one of the organisations on the\n\nlateral<,> uhm<,> spectrum or does it have a role which is overriding and\n\noverarching not all-powerful but giving it a role apart from the other civil\n\ninstitution\n As I said these are some questions that have concerned a lot of\n\npeople about how do you set up these organisations not allowing the state to\n\ntake them over but allowing them to be functional and I don't think there are\n\nany easy answers\n really felt that some of your\n\nanalyses need a little fine tuning for us to be clear about what is the role\n\nof the state if there is such a role and how does it relate to    the other agencies<,> uhm<,,>\n I think this takes us to the question of what facilitates and what\n\nhampers<,> community development<,> uhm<,,>\n of\n\nwhat is called garrison communities is one of those things which hampers<,,>\n\ncommunity development", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL',

to be some heroic\n\nperformances from the Jamaican bowlers if they are to prevent Guyana from\n\ngetting the one ninty-two of a victory\n\n<$B>  A hundred and ninety-one run is not really a great deal of runs\n\nas you're on this pitch now that it has dried out and it's playing a lot\n\nbetter\n Perhaps if the pitch was at the same state as it was at the\n\nbeginning of play it would be a little bit more difficult for Guyana but as\n\nyou said the bowlers will have to go out there and pull out their thumbs and\n\nreally get some early wickets and try to get into this batting line-up as\n\nquickly as they possibly can\n It's not the biggest field in the world it's a little bit slow the\n\noutfield    bring himself back on\n Instead McGarrell bowled\n McGarrell bowled his last three overs for all of twenty four runs a\n\n which/rich of eight runs for a wide\n I find it quite difficult to see how the Jamaican batsmen would\n\nhave scored eight runs of each of Hooper's last three overs\n He's very experienced\n He has done it at this level and at the highest level in the past\n\nthat is bowling a last ten overs\n And I certainly think he should have been the man to be brought\n\nback or he should have crawled back himself in the last six overs to complete\n\nhis ten\n But then again suppose he was thinking let's entertain the crowd\n\nlet them get a few more runs and    let it be\n\nmore interesting\n\n<$A> \n\n the match at fourteen runs or seven runs or something like that\n It's easy to be wise after the fact but it probably is also a\n\nmeasure of uh the

have a team down and you have a\n\nfew nails in the coffin you make sure and hammer all the nails in so that\n\nthat coffin doesn't open\n\n<$A>  telling\n\nthe truth Michael Holding and Laurie Williams who was the best of the\n\nJamaican bowlers in that rain affected match on Sunday the final Zone match\n\nagainst Trinidad and Tobago uh back at Sabina Park\n He had uh seven overs for twenty-seven runs in uh the race for runs\n\nby Trinidad Tobago as they eventually totalled one hundred and ninety-four of\n\nthirty-five overs\n Well here is the first delivery of uh the Guyanese reply and uh the\n\nfirst ball outside the off stump\n\n\nuh very much in the manner in which uh the uh Guyanese started with the bowl\n\nwith a wide and quite obviously in defence of a total of one hundred and\n\nninety-one uh with Gonsalves taking strike\n Uh you can't afford these liberties\n\n<$B>  No you don't give away a run when you haven´t made too many\n\nyourself\n Jamaica team should recognize the fact that\n\nthese two umpires they can be quite strict\n They were quite strict when Guyana were bowling\n So I would think they will be consistent throughout\n\n<$A>  Gonsalves with two slips in position faces up to the next\n\ndelivery from Laurie Williams pitches it out toward the cover point\n There is no run\n Scoring means that one without loss\n For anyone just tuning in to us here in Jamaica on K L A S F M\n\neighty-nine or wherever you are in the eastern Caribbean just uh coming up to\n\nten minutes to two o'clock here in Jamaica ten minutes to three around the\n\nCaribbean on a Thursday afternoon\n And uh it could be very interesting if uh the Jamaicans were to get\n\namong the wicket<,> could be a cakewalk if uh Guyana got off to a flying\n\nstart on the line-up like some turned away back with the square they'll go\n\nfor one\n The first run's off the bat uh for Andrew Gonsalves a bit of a\n\nfumble uh by Jermaine Lawson and they'll come back up for the second run and\n\nuh every additional run every error in the field will be punished severely\n\nand made to be feeling even more costly with the total of just one ninety-one\n So Gonsalves gets off the mark with two backward to square\n settling back\n\ninto their positions uh under the shade of the various trees on the northern\n\nside of the ground<,> here at Kaiser as Williams bowls to Gonsalves\n He's beaten by a good delivery that touches down just outside off\n\nstump and straightens on him goes through to the keeper Keith Hibbert and\n\ncertainly Laurie Williams will have to   \n\nproduce many more of those\n\n<$B>  That is the line that he needs for bowling though just outside\n\noff from the previous delivery was on Midland leg leg stump and just got\n\nworked down to fine leg for a comfortable two runs\n He want to keep the ball just outside off some as the Guyanese did\n\nwhen they had the new ball in their hands\n There're two slips still waiting\n\n<$A>  Samuels and Gayle are the men in slip positions as uh Williams\n\nbowls to Gonsalves so he's reaching for to good delivery plays it away square\n\non the off-side to Wavell Hinds<,> continues to struggle with the bat\n They got to twenty-one today before he fell uh to Carl Hooper\n\ncaught by Hind uh by the wicket keeper Vishal Nagamootoo<,>\n And here's uh the, scene at Kaiser\n It's a rather unusual one probably something along the line of\n\nKaiser's answer to London's millenium Dome away on the north east as uh\n\nWilliams bowls to Gonsalves short of a length and he is pushing into the\n\noff-side once again almost<,> studying the ball onto the face of the bat\n\npushed out towards Gareth Breese at mid-off\n\n<$B>  That one is better constructed and more useful\n\n<$A> \n\nt  a testament uh to capitalist style wastage of millions\n\nof pounds couldn't get uh much better than the Millenium Dome<,>    which was constructed to<,> make a\n\nbig deal out of a change of

for\n\nfifty in pursuit of one hundred and ninety-two to reach the Red Stripe Bowl\n\nFinal they are four without loss \n\n<$B>  Only has two fast bowlers in this line-up and lots of spin\n\njust as Guyana\n\n<$A>  Jermaine Lawson will take up the attack from the northern end\n\nand we don't have the sun with us at least for<,> a brief while not uh any\n\nthreat of rain at the moment and in fact

the ball\n\nand it just peeled off the outside at <unclear> name(John-L?)</unclear> to\n\nBenn at backward point\n A very simple catch no fun fair the Barbados team just gathering\n\ntogether in the middle of the field but I think they have recognize the fact\n\nthat they are so far ahead it's    almost impossible\n\nfor Trinidad and Tobago to get back in this game\n uh bigger\n You could see that they were more animated when it was they who got\n\nwickets\n Now it's just a matter of I think going through the motions and\n\nwaiting for the fifty overs to be bowled\n\n<$A>  Uh Brown going for nineteen and trying uh best to up the tempo\n\nand try to score\n It's really been a very disciplined performance by the Babardian\n\nbowlers\n Collins eight overs one maiden two for sixteen uh Bradshaw eight\n\novers no maidens one for twenty-three uh Bryan seven overs one maiden none\n\nfor twenty-two Benn ten overs one maiden one for twenty-nine\n He's completed his scores of ten and Hinds bowling in his eight\n\nover before the seven overs no maidens one for eighteen\n So he's picked up two wickets now and all the Barbadian bowlers\n\nstuck to their task and the Trinidad and Tobago side which really produced\n\nthe world record four hundred and nine in<,> fifty overs one-day cricket and\n\nwith three centurions in the tournament in their fight Smith Jackson and Lara\n\nand the double world record holder Brian Lara really struggling here at\n\nKaiser\n This is uh a ball that goes right to Merve Dillon\n It goes to Courtney Browne also\n F M eighty-nine\n\nmicrophones and uh\n Well two runs to Merve Dillon that hit the outside edge\n twenty five for six\n\n<$B> \n that's a run\n\n<$A> \n\nname(Adian?)</unclear> wouldn't mind how the runs come as long as they come\n They'd want some boundaries though\n Actually maybe a few fours and sixes of tidy off stump is Hinds\n\nkept low and Dillon was looking to cut it went by to be taken by Browne and\n\nanother over completed forty-one overs now gone and one hundred and\n\ntwenty-five for six\n\n<$B>  a big chance of getting these two hundred and\n\ntwenty runs\n just ten overs to go\n Nine overs to go as a matter of fact\n\n<$A>  Oh we are about to start over number forty-two HendyendyHendy\n\nBryan bowling his eight over bowls and that's uh uh\n Keno Mason drawing away and they're looking for an almighty hoik to\n\nthe off-side not making contact\n Well we have to maybe uhm see some shots like that\n\n\nwoodwork at the ball because there is no uh sense in pushing and looking\n\nfor twos and threes and singles unless they can score maybe six threes in an\n\nover\n now has gone maybe just\n\npast ten and a half for over to win this match\n They´ve got to try and place some big shots clear the boundary once\n\nor twice maybe in an over\n That's a hah slow ball\n That's gone miles into the air\n Browne is under it\n He'll take the catch and Keno Mason certainly deceived there with\n\nthe slow ball uhm was just maybe uh just below the waist high level and that\n\nshot being called a no ball as to the slow ball looking to hit it somewhere\n\ninto the Caribbean Sea out of the ground and hitting it high into the air\n Browne took the catch so Keno Mason is gone and uh Trinidad and\n\nTobago now were thinking closer and closer to defeat their one hundred and\n\ntwenty-five for seven in over number forty-two\n\n<$B>  The Merve Dillon is there standing and looking at both umpires\n\none    at a time and signalling to them or asking\n\nthem if the ball hadn't passed about waist high or if the ball hadn't got to\n\nthe batsman about waist high\n But it doesn't really matter\n that full tosses if\n\nthey are slow they can be called no ball if they are over shoulder-high\n It's fast full tosses about waist high that are called no balls not\n\nslow full tosses\n It's two different regulations one for fast and one for slow and\n\nthat certainly was a slow delivery from<,,> Hendy Bryan\n\n<$A>  All certainly a successful slow delivery from Hendy Bryan uhm\n\nusing his head and deceiving Keno Mason with that slow ball\n players on the Barbados side\n They know now they've got this all but soon enough and they will go\n\ninto the final on Sunday unless well something miraculous can happen from now\n\nuntil the end of the fifty overs here\n and Dillon is looking for a big\n\nhoik to the onside and they stuck somewhere on the<,> side pad and it bounces\n\naway into the off-side\n on two and with him Dave Mohammed yet to face the ball\n\nand in over number forty-two Trinidad and Tobago dung in the dumps one\n\nhundred and twenty-five for seven came into this game as big favourites to go\n\ninto the final against Guyana and uh that twenty-four for three Barbados look\n\nuh well as certain to not qualify and then all of a sudden a man called Floyd\n\nReifer came out and played a magnificent hundred and four not out got good\n\nsupport toward the end and Barbados managing two hundred and nineteen for\n\nfive full toss\n Another slow ball and it´s then Dillon places a straight bat out\n\ntowards Benn at long-off\n He goes now to three and the left-handed Dave Mohammed will take\n\nguard from umpire Bucknor the Jamaican one hundred and twenty-six now for\n\nseven Trinidad and Tobago in over number forty-two\n\n<$B>  Not too sure that was a slow one\n Sure I think that was a legitimate normal delivery from Hendy Bryan\n so I think that is what\n\nMervyn Dillon is actually speaking to Steve Bucknor about just now\n Don't think actually that matters though one run won´t help\n\nTrinidad and Tobago\n\n<$A>  Oh Bryan at the top of his mark\n yellow and blue uh national colours Trinidad\n\nand Tobago with the fire engine coloured red\n\n\n Mohammed was pitched on the line of the off stump and went away\n\nto be taken by the keeper and there is no run\n all the people across the Jamaica\n\nall my friends\n\n\nand really providing some very nice accommodation there\n The teams are also staying there some of the teams the Guyana team\n I was there enjoying himself this morning\n Here is Bryan bowls outside the line of the off-stump again that\n\nwent past the edge of Mohammed taken by Courtney Browne\n The over comes to an end\n they're now\n\nheading for what seems to be certain defeat one hundred and twenty-eight for\n\nseven needing two hundred and twenty to win\n\n<$B>  I'm wondering if Sherwin Campbell might not be thinking about\n\nbringing Pedro Collins back into the attack and trying to get these last two\n\nwickets as quickly as possible and wrapping it all up\n Last three wickets as a matter of fact\n Them wickets don´t push Trinidad and Tobago\n Pedro Collins bowled beautifully earlier on eight overs two for\n\nsixteen\n interested in\n\ndoing that at the moment though\n\n being given the ball to\n\noperate from the northern end\n\n<$A>  Yes well it seems as Richards now will come into the attack\n\nand he'll bowl from the northern end of the ground or is it Barry Wilkinson\n In fact it's Kurt Wilkinson\n Wanna say good afternoon to Barry Wilkinson in Barbados here from\n\n   the media over there and Kurt Wilkinson now will\n\nbowl<,> bowling from the northern end of the ground the huge uh black side\n\nscreen behind his back for the Red Stripe logo right across the bottom and he\n\ncomes and bowls and that's a ball that´s taken under part as Dillon looks to\n\nwork it into the onside\n and the total going up now to\n\none hundred and twenty- seven for seven here in over number forty-three\n are supposed to have a net session this\n\nafternoon and tomorrow they'll practice again and they'll get ready for the\n\nfinals on Sunday\n The Barbados team which came into the country on Wednesday and they\n\nseem now set to go into the finals\n The last time they won the competition was thirteen years ago\n That´s three titles in one-day cricket to the regional level\n In fact they won the very first regional competition in nineteen\n\nseventy-six and they have been really dominating the first class regional\n\ncompetition which began a lot earlier in nineteen sixty-six\n Wilkinson in the year two thousand and one bowls to\n\nMohammed\n Mohammed is forward and forces it down towards the cover position\n Griffith comes off the three-pole position and the cover boundary\n and uh he is now in fact off the mark\n And the total going up to one hundred and twenty-eight for seven\n So really just formality now\n Michael\n It's Barbados just trying to close off this game and turn their\n\nattention to the final\n\n<$B>  Not over yet though\n I think that they'll try to get the last three wickets\n But it doesn't seem as if they're all that interested in bowling\n\nTrinidad and Tobago out\n\n<$A>  Wilkinson bowls to Dillon\n Dillon looking to hit that somewhere on top of the trees and the\n\nmountains\n Makes no contact\n It comes off the pad and bounces away into the off- side\n Still one hundred and twenty-eight for seven in the forty-third\n\nover<,>\n So at one stage we were threatened with some very over-cast\n\nconditions\n The sun has come back in all its brilliance and the shadows of the\n\ntrees there from the mountains just lengthening across the ground really\n\nlovely conditions now\n Wilkinson bowls and down the track comes Dillon and lost that\n That's gone a long way\n That's gone for six over long off\n It was pitched up and Mervyn Dillon who can give the ball quite a\n\nclout when he gets ready uh really launching into that and hitting it for six\n And he is off the mark with a six one hundred and uh thirty-four\n\nnow for seven in over number forty-three<,>\n Dillon settles on this West Indies helmet and Wilkinson bowls to\n\nDillon\n Dillon is swinging and makes no contact and it comes off the pad\n You just have to wait on the signal of umpire Nicholls\n It went down towards the third man the crossed for a single and\n\numpire Nicholls like    a ballet dancer going up on\n\none leg signals the leg bye and the total going up to one hundred and\n\nthirty-five for seven\n Oh Mervyn Dillon might have in the back of his mind a few sixes in\n\neach over and Trinidad can still be home", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM',

four\n Tugging it across the line but in full control even though he\n\nplayed it against the spin and down towards mid-wicket for another boundary\n So he goes up with a boundary and the total going up to fifty-four\n\nfor one in the twentieth over\n\n<$A>  Nagamootoo comes in once more at the short ball and this time\n\nit maybe choked him a bit he was looking to pull and hits it down

semi-final\n Guyana going through because they won more matches in the\n\ncompetition and Barbados beating Trinidad and Tobago in the second semi-final\n Here in the final there could be a chance for a run out\n The bowl goes to the bowler's end and uh Sherwin Campbell was\n\ntearing down there on Richards\n The ball went towards short fine leg\n Dowlin came across and in the end Richards third weary was at the\n\nstriker's end and the Barbados captain Campbell very very disappointed\n He's gonna be certainly annoyed with Richards as he walks back\n He is gone run out and uh certainly a needless way to go\n Certainly no communication there between the two and Richards\n\nstanding where he was Campbell tearing down for the single\n\n<$A>  Yes uh someone with about ninety won the

You never know what could have happen and it's almost as if\n\nRichards had given up already and said well you've come along the track you\n\ngonna be definetely run out and Campbell was drawn\n Forward comes Richards and plays it out into the off-side down\n\ntowards Cush at square cover as Reifer comes now to join Richards\n Reifer who bat it brilliantly a hundred and four not out and he\n\ntook the game away from Trinidad and Tobago in the semi-final\n Forward comes Richards again and plays it quietly back towards\n\nHooper\n So fifty-four for one has now become fifty-four for two\n We're in over number twenty-one\n Glorious sunny condition\n as way\n\nback as long-on and he bowls to Richards again Richards is quietly forward\n\nand again there is no run\n Twenty-two to Richards and Reifer yet to score\n bowl\n\nKing for two the man gone\n Carl Hooper on his way passes the umpire Doctrove and bowls the\n\nball\n That might have just clipped the tight pad that went down the leg\n\nside\n Good efficient something there by Vishal Nagamootoo but the batsman\n\nhad not come out of his crease\n The over comes to an end\n At the end of it twenty-one overs gone\n Barbados batting for their fifty-four for\n\ntwo\n\n<$B>  solver of uh Friday Floyd\n\nReifer after they were in the dephts of twenty-four for three after some uh\n\nfourteen overs\n And uh a comparative uh look at where Barbados were against\n\nTrinidad and Tobago after some uh twenty-two overs was sure that they were\n\nfifty-nine for three\n Here they are fifty-four for two as uh Reifer first delivery from\n\nNagamootoo over number twenty-two\n And he is pushing forward pulling away the gloved underbat as it\n\ncomes of the pad into the onside\n And uh the score fifty-four for two is uh the wicket going down of\n\nGriffith for two and just recently Campbell run out for twenty-three\n Again he's reaching forward Reifer and uh comes up the pad picked\n\nup uh on the onside by Carl Hooper\n Uh at the moment uh Guyana will feel reasonably satisfied start\n\nvery much so as Nagamootoo goes\n And again he is pushing forward this time off the battle towards\n\nHooper at that mid-wicket position\n And you mention Michael at the rate that Guyana are going it could\n\nbe a very very long interval between the innings because this is already over\n\nnumber twenty-two\n And we're just uh into sixty-three minutes of play\n been\n\ncalled on as yet\n And the suggestion uh that Guyana with their slow bowlers will be\n\nwhittling through those overs as uh Reifer once more reaches four this time\n\npushing on the off-side is picked up by Shivnarine Chanderpaul\n\n<$B> And Reifer looking for the drive out towards\n\nlong-on will get the single to Ramnaresh Sarwan to get off the mark\n Dale Richards gets back on strike on twenty-two\n The total moves up to fifty-five for two\n We talked about uh that uh decision by Dale Richards to stand his\n\nground whether he requires uh almost uh a recognition of the state of the\n\nmatch uh    the man at the other end<,> as uh he was\n\njust about to come in and Nagamootoo but Hooper was still adjusting his field\n\nand umpire Bucknor calls that ball\n Neil McGarrell has to station out on the cover boundary\n And uh Chattergoon pushed a bit deeper as extra cover as Nagamootoo\n\nbowls to Richards off the back foot looking for the fourteenth shot and it\n\ngoes past the outside as the end of over number twenty-two the latest score\n\nat Kaiser\n\n\n<$B>  That was indeed a match that uh the West Indies had to win to\n\nstay in the running for semi-finals quarters\n Hooper starts over number twenty-three and this delivery turned\n\nsharply and opened up the left-hander completely\n He was pretty fortunate that it didn't clip the off stump or took\n\nthe outside edge through to Vishal Nagamootoo\n Certainly there is a lot of encouragement for the slow bowlers\n Hooper continues bowls uh to the left- handed Reifer\n This time he's reaching well onto the front for taking on the pad\n\ngoes now towards cover point\n Score remains at fifty-five for two\n Hooper as you've heard already already bowling three no balls the\n\nthree no balls in the innings in six extras<,> as bowls again cricket\n\ndelivery and uh Reifer onto the front foot pushes out towards McGarrell<,> at\n\nuh cover point\n Score remains at fifty-five for two\n Hooper who has that run in that is almost suggesting that he trying\n\nto get through a crowd sidling one way then the other as he bowls outside the\n\noff-stump\n This time Reifer lets it go through to the keeper\n And immediately Hooper just uh making an adjustment and the field\n\nis gonna  push Ramnaresh Sarwan from uh backward point out to the\n\ncover boundary\n Neil McGarrell is shifting around to that backward point position\n\nand it's uh Narsingh Deonarine coming into a regulation extra cover\n Brilliant sunshine as Hooper bowls and Reifer is uh in behind it\n\nagain pushing onto the onside\n\n\n<$B>  crease bowls and\n\nlooking to flick that one\n He does get some room to play the shot out towards long-on uh to\n\nget uh another run\n His uh second run only and uh the end of another very tight over uh\n\nby Carl Hooper has come to an end\n Uh the twenty-third over of the inning\n Guyana have moved on to fifty-six for\n\ntwo\n\n<$B>  And we're almost at the half way stage\n Over number twenty-four big bowled by Nagamootoo short and pulled\n\naround dropping just short<,> of uh Deonarine at uh forward off-square\n Was looking uh for that gap on the onside uh\n Floyd Reifer turning the wrists over and just as well uh because\n\nit could have carried to the fielder at square leg as it is\n No run\n Nagamootoo bowled outside the leg stump looking to save taking on\n\nthe pad picked up uh by brother Vishal from behind the stumps<,> and uh\n\nindeed the Barbadians will be recognizing that it could uh be<,> uh almost\n\nled into a false sense of security by the fact that uh the time isn't all\n\nthat far but uh the overs are whittling away\n As uh Reifer pushes defensively on the onside\n He might almost get programmed into believing well we have only\n\nplayed an hour and eight   minutes\n But actually we're almost half way through the allotment of overs\n\nas he's again reaching forward pushing on the onside\n This time it goes out towards square leg along the ground\n The score remains at fifty-six for two\n\n<$A>  Mhm\n\n<$B>  Just barely over two runs for over two point four three after\n\nthe last over\n As Nagamootoo bowls and he's reaching forward guiding it away\n\nsquare on the offside picked up at backward point\n And after twenty-four overs against uh Trinidad and Tobago on\n\nFriday Barbados will starting their recovery   \n\nat sixty-six for three after the inning twenty-four for three\n Reifer was the man then as he is now\n not\n\ngonna be appeal for a  catch because it's clearly off the pad\n\npicked up by the wicket-keeper\n The end of the over\n Twenty-four overs gone\nbreak-\n\ncommercials\n\n<$B>  It's gonna be Narsingh Deonarine from uh the northern end\n changes in the Guyana

right-arm bowler a bit mixed upas uh Michael\n\nHolding would have said\n Starts over number twenty- five as he bowls to Dale Richards was\n\nguiding it away into the off-side\n They'll get one\n Well they look for the second and immediate uh shout of no uh by\n\nRichards and uh he gets uh just his first run since the run out of Sherwin\n\nCampbell for twenty-three\n He moves on to twenty-three himself and the total goes up to\n\nfifty-seven for two<,>\n Field changing around for the left-hander and uh Carl Hooper\n\nhaving a word with Deonarine\n There's a long-off and a cover on the boundary and extra-cover\n\nbackward point and now Travis Dowlin is gonna go into slip\n On the onside there is only Carl Hooper within the thirty metre\n\ncircle\n There's a long-on and deep mid-wicket and a backward square leg\n Reifer onto the front who beats him\n\npast the outside edge Nagamootoo takes up the bill<,> put it back  put\n\nit anchored\n Score remains at fifty-seven for

Can see how high up on the back that ball hit\n awkward bounce just defeating Adrian\n\nGriffith there\n a cause as\n\nwell<,,>\n\n<$A>  Five overs gone\n\n\n<$A>  here\n\n\nmeans that Reon King is the only fast bowler in the side plenty of\n\nspinners<,,>\n\n<$B>  We were talking about that ball bouncing awkwardly at Adrian\n\nGriffith\n look at the ball\n\n where it's/was released by Reon King\n that the scene isn't\n\nupright\n He has held the ball across the scene\n across the pitch not straight down the\n\npitch<,>\n The scene is going in that direction instead of that direction and\n\nif the ball is rotating through the air over the scene like that when it\n\npitches<,,> it just could<,> bounce a little bit awkwardly\n Now if he did that purposely as we know the fast bowlers are hit\n\nblocked doing that\n\n\n\nthat I have seen do that was Andy Roberts\n Andy Roberts was the first one to show us how to do that years and\n\nyears and years ago\n\n<$A>  with Michael Holding it\n\nreally was not long ago\n\n There is Reon King now to Sherwin Campbell\n And Barbados again struggling at the start\n\n In the semi-finals before this and now continuing in the grand\n\nfinal here\n Barbados ten for one\n We're in the seventh over and they've already lost Adrian\n\nGriffith\n\n<$B>  bowling from Reon\n\nKing\n One thing that I am not very happy about Reon King though is his\n\nfoot placement when he's bowling\n foot lands\n Now this one\n That's where the right leg lands going almost in line with the\n\nbatsman's leg stump at the other end\n That's why he was warned in England at Lord's running on the pitch\n he couldn't bowl when the captain wanted him to\n\n\nthe pitches<,>\n What Reon King needs to do is to get that right leg to swing more\n\nacross his body\n Have a look at this\n\n But the right leg it's not landing where it should be landing\n\nsomewhere over here\n It should be swinging across his body to get that complete\n\naction\n that's\n\nnot where it should be\n If the left leg is here the right leg should either be landing\n\ntowards the same line where his left leg eventually lands again or a little\n\nbit further\n That's something that you have got to go into the next and work on\n It's not been possible to work on it\n It's not a drastic change in the reaction\n It's just a matter of getting that bowling arm to go more across\n\nyour body after release of the ball\n the bowling arm coming down between your legs\n\nand that action of swinging that bowling arm across your body will\n\nautomatically take your entire body around and so the right leg will follow\n\n<$A>  couple\n\nhere\n Ends of the seventh over\n The Barbados score has moved on to twelve for\n\none\n We had a very slow start here for the team batting first\n now for the off-side for McGarrell\n\n\ngotta place it very well to get through\n That will be out\n Big appeal by Bucknor\n\n<$B>  very fortunate he pitched it just\n\noutside leg<,> swung along the way but once it pitched outside leg<,> there\n\nends<,> all problems for the batsmen as far as L B Ws are concern\n\n<$A>  to\n\nMcGarrell in the qualifying round match<,> playing cross the ball\n knocked/not\n\nto the bowler for a return catch\n\n<$B>  again\n\n\ngood turn but you can see it's just between outside\n\nleg\n\n<$A>  mid-off goes\n\nback to long-off,\n And he made an over\n So Barbados stalled\n\n\n<$A> \n sure Barbados will panic uh when they knew what\n\nhappened<,> in the semi-final on Friday against Trinidad and Tobago\n They were similarly stalled early on\n\n\nRe  Floyd Reifer<,> sensible one from Ryan Hinds and that\n\nsentry partnership won some    good hitting at the\n\nend by Ian Bradshaw to put them up to<,> over two hundred<,>\n May not be enough even the score of two hundred and twenty two\n\nhundred and thirty today\n second semi-final\n Barbados got up to two nineteen for five\n but they protected it very well\n Trinidad and Tobago just a hundred and seventy for\n\nnine\n not\n\nout/at his first hundred in regional one day cricket\n That's over the top\n That's a typical Sherwin Campbell shot fling his arms and

it go through outside the\n\noff-stump just gentle little loosing up\n\n\nto resist throwing the ball at Javagal Srinath every time\n to resist that\n You can't have your lead bowler coming up at the end of the first\n\nday having bowled twenty-five or twenty-six overs\n\n<$C>  think of\n\nthis  what a pitch he's gonna have to bowl something in the region of\n\ntwenty overs at the end of the day\n

number\n There's Srinath\n who bowls to Hooper who's going\n\nforward\n He's jamming that bat down on the pad and showing that there's not\n\ntoo much going through and the ball just runs out alongside these stumps\n Lovely morning\n It's very hot out there\n difficult it is\n\nout there but uh it's a lot better than the rain coming down so    if it's not raining in Georgetown we'll take

there who's Shahid Khan who does a\n\ngood job <unclear> name</unclear> to his right picked it up gentle return in\n\nnot the longest of boundaries down at fine leg but Hooper will pick up a\n\nsingle\n So the first run is coming up after lunch\n India still haven't used Sarandeep Singh the off-spinner but uh no\n\ndoubt in my mind you'll see him at some point now\n and a spinner at the\n\nother end throughout that you think  <- > he'll  he'll give\n\nanother go to vote Seema and then take it from there\n\n<$C>  Uh certainly Srinath is gonna have to bowl maybe another four\n\nor five overs here to try to pick up a wicket or two\n He's been looking for at least uh one wicket at the other end uh\n I think he might be tempted and I could be wrong to just bowl a\n\ncouple overs uh maybe    of the fielder just again\n\nbut I don't think the two  far off teams and between bowl\n\n<$D>  Back with Srinath is now in to Sarwan who's going onto bat for\n\nanother\n It's a lot of

that for three uh the West Indies with\n\ntwenty-seven to Sarwan twenty-two to Hooper\n Sarwan definitely the pick of the batsman in the morning and I\n\nthought one cover drive that he played    was just\n\nsensational\n But we said that about Stuart Williams earlier on\n gonna\n\nput uh the number on for Ramnaresh Sarwan to thirteen for his first century\n But if he is a history man he look back at the numbers and say last\n\ntime India came here<,> they gave Chanderpaul his first hundred and it looked\n\nfor a while that Chanderpaul did never get one\n\n<$C>  It did\n Uh he struggled to get to that free for the mark for long long time\n\nhad a number of half centuries was actually very prolific uh getting past uh\n\nthe half central mark but never able to carry on\n And Stuart Williams also got a hundred against India here\n So I think as you said before the omens look good for Ramnaresh\n\nSarwan\n He's already batted for probably an hour and a half and has looked\n\nbetter with every minute that has passed and    he\n\ndoes need time in the middle\n He needs a long inning and he's looking as though he's growing in\n\nconfidence the speed of starting to move well\n\n<$D>  Now Sanjay Bangar has been given the ball\n He's running in\n He's bowling to Carl Hooper who's driving on the onside\n want to watch\n\nCarl Hooper bat but he finds the fielder down at mid-on that's Anil \n\nKumble and\n and just as Bangar is marking out\n\nhis run up\n There were two men down the slips marking out their positions as\n\nwell\n Lakshman and Dravid just\n\nputting their hand up checking their distance\n uh when\n\nuh just before lunch Hooper had snicked one through them<,> and they've cut\n\nthat now but it's a bit like bolting the door phh of the house is gone\n How much will Hooper

make the  sail effective\n That's Reon King who's not the best fielder in the world\n There's Campbell to run\n\n It's one forty-five for three and Hooper will do battle against\n\nthe Jamaica captain

off-stump\n Samuels comes forth pushes back to Hooper\n It's one forty-five for three\n That's the latest score at Sabina Park\n\n<$C>  well\n\ngetting into the overs rather quickly here and that is

test matches to play against one country\n As this delivery is outside the off-stump\n Hibbert ignores it\n One that was further outside the off-stump by Nagamootoo taken by\n\nthe keeper\n He's got twelve his captain Samuels is on four\n It's one forty-five for three\n Over number sixty-two being bowled by Nagamootoo andthis is about\n\n<unclear> word(s)</unclear> on the back when it cuts it

Jamaica will be happy\n\nwith this score and if they can maintain it uhm not the same  revel if\n\nthey can just keep the runs taking over and get a couple of runs of every\n\nover not losing the

they have pulled him\n\nback and now they've put on number seventeen Christopher Harvey\n He's the only defender named on their list of substitutes\n So let's see how they will employ him\n They're leading by two goals\n By my watch it's about six minutes left unofficially of course\n\nplus any time that referee Victor Stewart might add on\n It's uh not impossible for a team to score two goals inside this\n And even if Arnett scored two goals that's still not the end of it\n They'll have to go into extra-time\n But definitely now the Harbour View team would like to put an\n\nextra- battery

then the\n\nplayers can easily help the referee to identify the ten yards\n You got ten yards from there the players have to be behind the\n\npenalty spot and they can use that guide to demand the full ten yards\n Usually in situations like these they don't get the full ten yards\n\nbut where the ball is now they have a good uhm<,> guide on which to get the\n\nten yards\n\n\n<$B> \n Here's a whistle\n Davis is there so too Kevin Wilson\n diving to his\n\nright and plucking the ball out of the air\n The crowd is starting to stream out from the Tony Sporting Complex\n Two minutes to go unofficially\n And it's Harbour View leading Arnett Gardens by three goals to one\n Friday they started this match switching over from cricket in\n\nSabina Park<,> here to the Tony Sporting Complex uh but Williams said that\n\nthe law of averages<,> is pointing for a Harbour View win and it looks as\n\nthough that is precisely what will happen\n\n<$A>  seems as if that will materialise\n Regular

card first\n uhm\n\nChin-Sue's part<,>\n No reason for him to do that\n He was the one carrying the fight for Arnett Gardens\n\n\nfor the rest of his team\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  So both

inside\n\n<$A> \n\n  I rather like the way they played uh that last attack\n\nbecause there were plenty of passes plenty of quick footed movement in the\n\nattack\n And uh this is the way I think that

\n it has been the Jamaicans with six shots\n\nall on goal<,>\n think maybe four or five on goal\n for a\n\ngoal kick to Jamaica\n Still one nothing\n\n\nJamaica versus Barbados at the National

the\n\nassistant<,>\n Andy Williams across field to Theodore Whitmore\n He gets it farther right to Neil\n First touch trying to get it to Taylor\n Good attempt but uh just a slipping off the instep and it goes\n\ninto touch for a throw to Barbados\n\n<$A>  Yes the point I was about to make is that uhm I don't think\n\nBarbados they have done a lot of homework here because where they should be\n\nconcentrating the attack is over on Gerald Neil's side\n He hasn't had too much exposure at the international level\n They ought to have done their homework and realise that that is\n\nthe place put him under pressure and see how he responds\n Claude Davis uhm much more accomplished a lot more experience at\n\nthis level<,> he's gonna give up this left hand corridor all that easily\n\n<$Z> \n Adrian Chase under a\n\npressure just now\n The goal keeper had to hurry to clear that one\n It gets into touch and it's gonna be a throw to Barbados\n goes to Barrows on the\n\nleft hand side\n straight to\n\nLinval Dixon who gets a header on to Whitmore who heads it uh farther on to\n\nCornel Chin-Sue but is broken up by Parris for Barbados\n\n Jamaica attacking again\n gets it to Steward who\n\nplays it behind for Linval Dixon\n Still inside the central circle with the ball in Jamaica's\n\nhalf<,> is Whitmore\n Turns\n the Barbados half gives it to Taylor back to the\n\ngoal again\n He knocks it back off to Whitmore\n He plays it far left to Claude Davis in a wing back position\n He puts it inside the box to Jermaine Hue cultured left foot\n Gets it back to Whitmore\n Jamaica a

Jermaine Hue's certainly not in the business of\n\nmaking crosses\n He's more of a central uh midfielder\n So finding if anything this unfamiliar outside left position uh\n\nhe doesn't realise that he has to turn his man first<,> and then produce the\n\ncross rather than keep charging down the cross\n I think he's gonna get an accurate one in before long though\n\n<$Z> \n Claude Davis to Andy Williams flicks it to Taylor\n He's inside the box back to the goal\n He gets it back out to Neil\n\n\n<$A>  Over-ambitious on the part of Neil there\n Palm has to be known for scoring goals uh uh at all never mind\n\nfrom outside the area and did have one spectacular one in the Premier League\n\nFinal of a season ago\n certainly I think he could have controlled that and\n\nproduced a pass to someone a bit closer uhm to the goal and then that person\n\nmay have been able to come up uh with a much better effort on the target\n\n<$Z> \n Cornel Chin-Sue hits back the ball inside from the goal kick gets\n\nit to Jermaine Hue who finds Andy Williams who is now in a left wing back\n\nposition\n\n And John Parris the captain of Barbados is called for the foul\n\nkick to Jamaica\n\n<$A>  That's what I want to see\n Andy Williams doing dribbling taking on defenders and put them\n\nunder real pressure induce free kicks\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n back inside to\n\nChin-Sue who now finds Jermaine Hue is on the right side\n Hue\n\n by Steward Hall all the way up field and\n\nRiley is saying well I was right in front to you so why did you play the ball\n\nso long\n Riley's still inside his own half\n

right in front of\n\ngoal\n\n<$A>  Yes it's the dead central so they possibly can conjure\n\nsomething from this as Jamaican defenders certainly they're going to have to\n\nbe very very careful here<,> cos I don't think they'll be too familiar with\n\nwhat Barbados is scheduled    of doing uhm from\n\nthis position so they're going to have be uh very very careful indeed\n And Ricketts organising things in front of him\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n\n\n He's to the left\n Goodridge is behind the ball for Barbados\n to block the\n\nwall and the goal keeper<,>\n Jamaican wall inching up a bit\n Here comes Goodridge\n The players move all the way\n\n Comes back to Parris\n Barbados still with the ball\n He tries to get it to Riley\n Fabian Taylor has come all the way back to do some defending too\n Riley still with the ball\n This is Llewelyn Riley\n He has Steward Hall\n missed by Barbados\n Andy Williams tries to keep it in\n on the far side\n heads the ball back to Steward and a beautiful\n\nout pass from Damian Steward finds Andy Williams\n And Whitmore coming straight down the middle of the pitch\n just off the forward line\n Whitmore through the legs\n Beautiful move but that was broken up by Cox\n The stadium loved that one but uh the Barbadians coming away with\n\nthe ball<,,>\n Here they come down the left hand side\n Lucas makes the run\n Shavar Thomas is there\n\n the referee calls that one\n\n\n<$A> \n Yes because he got clean away from his man\n However he brought it back and I think that is where uhm the\n\nBarbadians need to attack uhm on the right side of the Jamaican defence\n Contact made\n and uhm his\n\nshorts was tugged as well<,> but uhm perhaps the Barbadians may not be\n\nentirely unhappy<,,>\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n Goodridge again with a free kick\n Two-man wall this time\n He puts it hard on goal and just missing the back post\n Ricketts coming for that one\n Maybe not as close as we thought from where we are\n But a swerving shot swerving all the way\n Ricketts went full stretch and missed it\n So certainly Donovan Ricketts thought it was close enough to go\n\nfor it<,> but in the end it goes behind\n\n\n<$A>  was a\n\nplayer who nearly got onto the end of it and all it would have needed had it\n\nbeen<,> closer in was    a simple deflection and uhm\n\nthat would have been an equalising goal\n have given some indication\n\nthat they can uhm hurt the Jamaicans so they really have to be careful<,> uh\n\nworkers and not give away too many free kicks in and uhm just around that\n\npenalty area\n\n<$Z> \n Ball played into touch to throw it to Barbados\n We told you earlier the Jamaicans they start the Gold Cup\n\nqualifies next Wednesday right here at the National Stadium\n And the overseas based players that are confirmed to be here\n\nKevin  Lisby from Charlton Athletic Deon Burton from Portsmouth\n\nJermaine Johnson from Bolton Wanderers Ricardo Gardener from Bolton Wanderers\n\nand Jamie Lawrence\n We haven't seen Jamie Lawrence for a while from Bradford City\n So the five players confirmed with the Jamaican team to start the\n\ntournament come this Wednesday right here at the National Stadium\n Here is Parris for Barbados\n goes\n\nbehind and it is gonna be a corner to Barbados\n\n\n\nconf uh  would be thought of as an overseas based player\n So too maybe Andy Williams\n So that'd be seven\n\n\nShavar Thomas too so that would make eight<,>\n from the\n\nright side right footed<,,>\n The heads go up\n Here's a chance for Barbados inside the box\n He comes across goal\n Steward makes the clearance\n with a left footed shot\n comes back to Goodridge\n Jamaica not out of problems yet\n He's just outside the box a swerving shot goes straight to\n\nRicketts\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Well the Barbados are now beginning to demonstrate some\n\namount of attacking capabilities uh much to the consternation of the\n\nJamaicans\n\n\nthe Barbadians were prepared to be positive<,> right at the beginning\n\nrather than using the tactical ploy of hanging back and soaking up pressure\n\nthen we may have had a much more exciting and probably a football match in\n\nour hands and probably as we approach half time uhm we may have seen the\n\nBarbadians give the scorers something positive to do\n\n<$Z> \n Two minutes of time added on\n is it one\n fourth official\n\nin just a little while<,>\n\n\n<$A>  Or two minutes to go to forty-five minutes\n\n<$Z> \n And then we will get the fourth official\n\n\nminutes of time added on\n\n Maybe you weren't here maybe you were on Mars or something and\n\nyou haven't heard  <,>  but uhm\n\nAustralia<,> uh the World Cup Champions   this is\n\n<$A>  Right from the outset\n\n<$Z> \n Taylor can't keep the ball in\n making a whopping three hundred and\n\nforty-nine for two Ricky Ponting a hundred and forty knock out the highest<,>\n\ntotal in a world cup final<,,>\n the highest total in a world\n\ncup final the highest total  <- > bar  by Australia in a\n\none-day game<,> two hundred and thirty-four on partnership the highest in the\n\nworld cup between Ponting<,> and Damian Martin\n\n<$A>  And at the end of it all a hundred and twenty-five run\n\nvictory\n\n<$Z> \n Sachin Tendulkar man of the tournament Ricky Ponting not\n\nsurprisingly man of the match today<,>\n Here is Barbados\n\n\nDonovan Ricketts and as we thought<,,> just a minute of time added on<,,>\n April ten\n\nthe first test match<,> at the Border Ground in Guyana\n Here is Whitmore\n\n Inside to Williams\n Can he get the shot off\n He leaves it for Cornel Chin-Sue\n shovels that one with the left foot\n good smack at it\n Just a side footed the ball really to go keep a chase\n Barbados they come away with it\n the most experienced player on the Barbados\n\nteam\n\n Free kick to Jamaica\n Thirty-five yards away\n Chin-Sue seems to be alright\n But Chin-Sue getting a nice ball across goal as Goodridge brings\n\nhim down after\n But should have probably hit that one with the instep\n He's a right footed player\n\n\n<$A>  be\n\ntold<,> wrong player in that position uhm to finish all the chance\n the\n\nthe  the first half<,> and it's a free kick\n It's some distance out but I think the Jamaicans have a player\n\nfor this\n\n<$Z> \n Whitmore is there\n Andy Williams will take it\n He chips it over for Whitmore\n It's headed out by Jamaica\n Davis tries to keep it in but is headed up by Barbados\n and it's\n\ngonna be a throw<,> to Jamaica\n\n\npossession  position\n\n for\n\nBarbados\n He gets it up front to Riley\n There is no call on the play\n The ball rolls to Shavar Thomas\n Jermaine Hue has it\n Should hear the whistle any minute now\n looks at his watch and he calls\n It is half time\n And at half time the Jamaicans through Fabian Taylor a nineteenth\n\nminute goal\n Jamaica lead here at the National Stadium one nothing\n\n\n<$A>  Uh Yes uhm it went pretty much according to the Jamaica\n\nscript in that they wanted to open the scoring based on what Carl Brown has\n\nbeen saying about goal scoring uh or to have been walking off the pitch at\n\nthis point with two goals in the back hasn't happened\n They have one\n They have played positively in that they have kept Barbados\n\npinned back in their own half of the field uh for lengthy periods\n On the other hand the Barbadians have not been at all positive\n\nfor the most part in that they have the uhm basically uhm stayed back uhm\n\npretty close    to their defensive third and tried to\n\nsoak up the pressure\n\n\nsomewhat\n They came out uhm towards the end of the half and tried to be\n\npositive\n as uh Fabian Taylor uhm the goal\n\nscorer\n He must be happy uh could have had three\n Could have had a hattrick before half time but I'm sure he's\n\nhappy with the one and he'll be coming back out uhm to work very hard for the\n\nsecond\n pretty much\n\ngone I beg your pardon the way that the Jamaican coaching staff uh\n\nthought it would\n Perhaps they are not happy with just the one goal advantage going\n\nto the dressing room\n\n<$Z> \n Jamaica one Barbados nil\n Half time\n\n\n<$Z> \n as the teams have made\n\ntheir way back onto the pitch\n\n with a nineteenth minute goal\n Pretty decent goal\n He had a couple of opportunities uh hit a powerful header against\n\nthe upright<,> and it spun nicely inside the box to bang one straight to goal\n\nkeeper<,> Adrian Chase\n\n\nthe first half\n\n\n<$A>  Yes certainly but you must look better if you are positive\n\nand uh try to come forward try to score goals\n uh half an hour of the\n\ngame is just to hang back and try to soak up pressure which basically\n\nbackfired because   uh  Fabian Taylor punished\n\nthem in the nineteenth minute\n Now in the last quarter of an hour of the opening half they were\n\ncertainly uhm more serious in terms of attacking play and they basically\n\nforced the game a lot of the times on to Jamaica's end of the field and were\n\nable to induce some free kicks and really put good pressure uh on    the Jamaican defenders who looked a little<,> uh\n\ntentative and a little confused looking at each other<,> uh on one or two\n\noccasions not absolutely sure<,> uhm exactly what is it they wanted to do in\n\nterms of defending<,>\n Uh Fabian Taylor had an outstanding first half\n Probably thinks now that he should have had a hattrick really\n The opportunity was certainly there\n He's only got one\n He'll be looking for more and there's the possibility that he\n\nwill get it\n Now from a Barbados point of view they have to score the opening\n\ngoal because I do believe that if Jamaica scores the opening goal in this\n\nsecond half there is gonna be curtains\n I don't think that Barbados will be able to find a way back from\n\nthat\n\n<$Z> \n Haven't seen any changes the officials just having a chat in the\n\nmiddle of the pitch\n now giving some instructions\n They hold hands as they normally do\n Renaldo Francis he comes uh to the bench side\n goes to the bleachers side here at the\n\nNational Stadium<,>\n the Cayman Islands\n with the\n\nUnited States game here at the National Stadium\n having a pretty decent uh game down the right side\n\n\n Hit the inside of the bar\n here at the National\n\nStadium\n Jermaine Hue immediately with a long ball to Neil comes off his\n\nhead and goes into touch for a throw\n\n<$A>  Uh yes a little too high there you mean\n but uh wasn't able to get\n\nthe top of the head onto that to keep it in play\n\n<$Z> \n\n leaves it for Theodore\n inside to Chin-Sue\n\ntrying to get it to Williams\n and it goes to Jonathan Straker\n\nin defence for Barbados\n\n Goodridge back to his captain Parris\n\n\n\nJamaica\n Jermaine Hue plays it back to Claude Davis\n\n nice move by Davis\n But now the ball is given away\n Taylor comes to help out Jamaica and gets it back to Davis gets\n\nit across to Damian Steward Here is\n\nSteward<,> in<,> the middle of the Barbados half\n what Steward did\n Well I think he played it out deliberately because uh Fabian\n\nTaylor<,> uh was touched earlier and went down<,>\n\n\nknocking the ball<,,> off the line\n Carl Brown just giving some instructions as he has an opportunity\n\nto now\n uh his midfielders that you have to push\n\nforward\n has a little joke with his captain\n Taylor coming for a ball\n Goodridge put in the boot\n Uh Taylor just getting a touch and went down immediately\n Claude Davis making the pass and then the ball played\n\ndeliberately into touch by Damian Steward to give Fabian Taylor a chance to\n\nbe treated\n\n<$A>  think the referee also\n\nplayed the advantage because certainly it looked inelegant of the way why\n\nboth players    went to each other<,> uhm\n uh at\n\nthe moment and uhm he certainly uhm is looking at little anxious there\n\nbecause if Taylor obviously uhm wereas he would be the man uhm to uhm\n\npossibly replace Taylor if there's going to be a replacement for the out and\n\nout striker\n\n\nanother one bright young player Nicolas in terms of ability and uhm if he\n\ncontinues to improve<,> uh then certainly he would be one of the names that\n\nwe're gonna be hearing a great deal about<,> uhm for some considerable uhm\n\nperiod uhm    in the future\n Ball being returned now to Jamaica after the treatment of Taylor\n\nwho is fit enough to continue\n And Taylor probably felt that he hasn't done enough yet because\n\nas I keep emphasising the point uhm he ought to have had a hattrick<,>\n\nreally", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM',

screaming down the right hand side\n Blair decides to go inside\n Plays it forward to Sheddon\n Now it's out to Niel\n Here comes the cross\n It's a lofted one\n The keeper's coming off his line\n He claims it well\n It really maybe needed a flatter uh cross with a little more pace\n That was too easy for the keeper from Niel but at least he didn't\n\nblast it over to the other side\n Seba on the attack now\n Counter attack with Alden Dunn\n Clarke goes into the penalty area\n Here comes the cross and that's the type of cross that Niel didn't\n\ndeliver and it's just as well\n It's gone away over to the far side and out for a goal kick\n\n<$B> \n recording\n\ninterrupted\n\n<$A> Kick by Selvin Collins\n Off Sheddon\n ten yards inside\n\nthe Arnett half stand side of the ground\n Here is Clarke skipping one way then the other being tackled up by\n\nfirst Blair then Niel\n Free kick awarded to Seba almost right on the touch line on this\n\nleft hand side of the field as Seba United kick up towards Maxfield Avenue<,>\n Scott plays the ball forward for Edwards\n Really needs a good left footed cross\n It isn't a good one\n It's all along the ground and easily picked up by Niel who bangs it\n\ndown field\n Should find Bunsie\n Back heel inside\n That was intended for Chin-Sue but cut out by Scott\n Here is Dennis\n Runs into three players\n Oh I'm not quite sure about that uh referee Powell\n uh three Arnett players and Boyd was\n\ncoming away with the ball but the free kick given Seba's way,\n And uh maybe a bit of poetic justice has come right back to Arnett\n\nGardens but the advantage lost\n Here is Boyd\n Little pass right to Sheddon\n Now back inside to Bunsie further inside to Chin-Sue and into the\n\ncentre circle now for Blair on uh the right foot played over to the left\n\nflank where Earle is waiting\n Earle with the cross comes in to Bunsie\n Needed to control it and do something more with that\n Seemed to not have an idea of what he wanted to do and in the end\n\nlooked as if he was just running it forward for Boyd who was in no position\n\nto deal with the ball\n He had his back to the goal and two players behind him and Bunsie\n\nhad the opportunity to bring that ball down and shoot\n Now the kick is taken\n It comes across to Earle is fired over the crossbar and out for a\n\ngoal kick\n Drive immediately in front\n\nof us and the stands behind us as the ball is played down the left hand side\n\nfor Brown and Brown a little slow in getting to there\n comes across and just\n\ntouches the ball out for a throw-in\n Taken quickly by Scott\n Forward for Clarke\n Clarke again his back to the Arnett goal\n Now he turns to face but sees two players in front of him\n Blair\n Blair is winning the ball and is being fouled by, eh Brown and\n\nso the free kick given to Arnett\n Taken by Sheddon\n\n\nBria  only uh  Brian Hill waiting for it\n Hill gets a return pass from Dunn\n Gives it back to Dunn over on the right hand side\n Dunn going forward\n Gets around Barnes\n Shot towards goal and it's finished in\n\n A free kick given\n Brian Hill rammed it into the net from a melee of players but an\n\ninfringement on the goalkeeper Selvin Collins in the penalty area, uh\n\nnegating that goal scored by a combination of Dunn and Hill but uh\n Dunn Hill that's pretty good but it was uhm good work by Seba\n\nUnited to uh<,> flow so freely from that poor pass from Sheddon into the\n\ncentre circle but it comes to nought\n Here is Dunn one of the architects of that bit of play a little\n\nwhile ago\n Knocked on for Scott\n Comes back to Malcolm\n He's trying to create an opening for the shot\n It's played left out to Clarke\n Clarke taking a little too long on the ball\n Sheddon a two-footed challenge wins the ball and plays it out to\n\nBlair\n Blair forward now to Bunsie\n Bunsie always seems to have so much time as the ball comes back\n\nnow to Blair and Blair running out of ideas again turns straight into Mcnish\n\nwhen he really needed to just touch the ball down the right flank and\n\ncontinue his run\n Gets the throw-in though\n He's on the ball now\n Inside to Bunsie\n Bunsie tackled from behind by Scott and the ball comes loose to\n\nBrown\n Brown knocks it back for Malcolm in the centre circle\n His left footed pass out of that centre circle goes all the way\n\nthrough to Selvin Collins<,> who sends his kick up towards the halfway line\n\nand it will go out shepherded by Andrew Edwards\n A throw-in to Seba United just inside their own half\n Collins keeping in a bright yellow jersey and black uh tracksuit\n\nbottoms\n He'll look and see now that Clarke is coming towards him through\n\nthe legs of uh a defender to Dunn\n Dunn trying to create an opening\n Mark Wilson\n of danger\n\nyet\n Now it is as it rolls back for a goal kick to Arnett Gardens\n time gone in the match so far twenty minutes and\n\nstill no goals\n\n<$B>  But Seba United really did well to create that chance\n to show what the referee\n\nblew for\n Whether it was a handball a foul or an offside because his\n\nlinesman was right in line there\n His flag was up for\n\n\n<$A>  Side Hill lobs it forward now for Dunn to chase\n Barnes is going across\n the ball running out of\n\nplay\n So it's a goal kick which Collins will take\n There are dark clouds coming down from uhm I suppose the Maxfield\n\nAvenue end\n Down from Half Way Tree as well\n Very cloudy conditions coming down towards the ground\n Looks like we might get some rain\n Here's Scott keeping the ball in well\n Knocks it over the head of Sheddon but Sheddon sticks out the\n\nright foot\n Hooks it forward to Bunsie down the right flank\n Sheddon is continuing his run down the right flank but Bunsie hits\n\nit straight into the legs of Edwards who comes away with it\n Ball is forward now for Brown\n brings the ball inside to Hill\n Hill almost sporting a nineteen seventies afro\n Gets away from his man nicely though who was Pringle\n Plays it forward for Brown\n Is he offside\n The flag is up\n in\n\nfront of the last defender who was Eugene Barnes<,>\n Uhm the flag up and the free kick given\n Collins hasn't quite found his range yet with his goal-kicks\n Sends it over to the right hand side\n Sheddon does well to keep it in play\n Gets a return pass from Bunsie\n Malcolm standing in front of him\n Plays it back inside to Blair\n Blair long ball forward looking for Pringle\n He's taken it on the chest and he's taken a boot in the face which\n\nis unfortunate for Arnett because<,> his momentum   \n\ntook him forward towards goal with the ball but he went down from the\n\nboot to the face\n Now had he dropped that down to the right boot and fired he would\n\nhave had just the goalkeeper to beat but uh Owen Powell wants uh the Arnett\n\nphysio to come on\n Dennis brings the ball out of defence\n Plays it over to Evans right hand side the right wingback hasn't\n\nseen much of the ball so far and that's probably why\n He sends a long ball forward straight into the penalty area\n Straight into the arms of Collins\n clearance made by Collins\n\ngoes straight back to Evans\n Now to Hill and over to Dunn\n Dunn on the right hand side plays it inside for Malcolm\n Malcolm knocks it back to the right for Evans\n Evans threads a pass down the right flank for Hill to chase but\n\nit's too long again and Collins comes out diving forward claims the ball\n Now he throws it out to Bunsie just uh outside the centre circle\n\n\nByron Earle who is in the circle\n He knocks it forward\n and now it's Arnett Gardens down\n\nthe left hand side\n Walter Boyd making some strides plays the ball inside but uh the\n\nflag is up for an infringement over on the far side\n Not sure if the foul has gone to Arnett Gardens\n Looks as if it has for the tackle of Walter Boyd\n Walter\n\nBoyd standing over the ball with  Collie Smith  right behind\n\nhim looking up towards the new stands\n He'll play this ball in on the breeze with the right boot\n towards goal and taken nicely by\n\nPicknight\n Really pulled it into the chest and handled it well and\n\nimmediately releases the ball to Dunn\n Forward now for Brown\n Brown struggling to get the ball back to Dunn who made a good run\n\ndown the right flank\n Taken away and it's with Chin-Sue now\n Looks right to see Blair\n Blair forward for Sheddon\n Sheddon giving the ball away to Scott and now it's with Hill\n\nmiddle of his own half\n Hill with a good ball left hand side and Brown just backheeling\n\nthe ball into Gerald Niel who was following right behind him and wins a\n\nthrow-in for Seba United<,>\n Throw-in comes in to Malcolm\n Just gets a boot to it but Bunsie is there to pick up the loose\n\nball\n Gets it to Chin-Sue who

now and it's a tame effort just wide off the right hand\n\npost all along the ground\n but uh\n\nmissed out on that one and when the ball came back to him uh he couldn't uh\n\nget as much power as he

will take it\n Throws it forward to Bunsie\n Bunsie gives it back to him\n He has to get out of a challenge quickly from Scott but he does so\n Now it's with Bunsie down the right hand side\n Sheddon being held a bit by uh Dennis\n Eventually he's brought to the ground by Edwards rather\n Little back heel from uh Malcolm\n Gets the ball up to Dennis but taken away from him by Sheddon\n Now a nice little bit of play between him and Blair\n Sheddon trying to thread that ball into the path of Pringle\n It's charged down by the Seba defence\n Given away now to Bunsie and Bunsie robbed of the ball by Malcolm\n Malcolm knocks the ball forward\n Not clear of trouble yet as Pringle takes it away from Mcnish down\n\nto the right flank\n Tries to get a cross in\n Tackle comes in sends him to the

kicks\n\nfrom that    direction or corner kicks\n\n Edwards forward to Clarke and Clarke loses out to Gerald Niel and\n\nseems to take a blow to his face as well\n but the ball has gone into the middle of the\n\nArnett half where it's with Eugene Barnes\n Forward for Chin-Sue\n Chin-Sue knocks it back for Niel in the right wingback position\n Clarke and does so in the end\n Gets it down the right flank for Bunsie\n Bunsie flicks it between two players Malcolm and Clarke but Malcolm\n\nturns     the quicker and gets the ball\n Now it's with Dennis big man out of defence\n Over to the right hand side and it's Dunn who got behind Pringle\n Fires a good shot and a good save by Selvin Collins throwing\n\nhimself to his left\n It was at the goalkeeper's height which was around about chest high\n\nand he threw himself to the left and tipped it around his left hand post but\n\neh good break by Seba United good strike by Dunn and he's won a corner kick\n to be taken over on the far side\n behind the flag\n Here comes the kick in towards the area and back peddling is Selvin\n\nCollins\n He doesn't have to do too much though although uh Edwards was\n\narriving at the far post\n It was too far away from the far post and eventually the ball went\n\nout for a goal kick<,>\n Tall man is Collins\n\n\nsenior squad that is<,> for the last game against Costa Rica\n but uh tell you what if Aaron Lawrence has a few\n\nmore performances like he did in that match it won't be too long before\n\nCollins is the starting goalkeeper or maybe Ricketts\n kicks\n\nit on the edge of his area\n well not his better nights for\n\nJamaica in goal against Costa Rica\n and it's a free kick for Arnett Gardens\n Chin-Sue will take it\n Knocks it forward for Boyd\n Boyd a little slow in getting there\n Mcnish gets there first\n Bit of pulling from Mcnish and a free kick awarded to Arnett\n\nGardens\n Taken quickly by Boyd\n Knocks it in to the penalty area but it's carried forward on the\n\nbreeze, and straight into the hands of uh Picknight who has to kick out\n\nagainst that breeze\n breeze turning around here\n\nbecause it's going with him now and down the right hand side\n Dunn chasing\n Barnes gets there\n So too does Collins and Collins knocks it out and knocks it out\n\nwell to Pringle left hand side of the field to Earl\n Earl back to Pringle and Pringle his momentum again taking him\n\nforward\n The ball ricocheted off went to Evans who's won it back from\n\nPringle who in turn won it from him a little while ago\n Now it's with Dodd\n finding a lot of room down the right back forward to\n\nHill\n Hill not choosing to come in\n He was sort of in the inside right position and then decided to\n\ntake the ball away when the better option would have been to go directly for\n\ngoal but he's won a free kick to the right hand side of the penalty area<,>\n\nand Arnett not defending too well down that right side\n We've seen Dunn manage to get through and put passes through to\n\nHill\n And the Seba United players haven't really managed to finish off\n\nexcept for Dunn's shot a little while ago\n Here comes the kick into the penalty area\n Nodded away by Niel who again does his trademark somersault and the\n\nball is knocked out for a corner kick\n The stands behind us uh almost full except for the lower tiers\n Here comes the corner kick but it comes uh across the top of the\n\ngoal\n Rolls along the top netting\n\n<$B>  have been keeping the ball and they\n\npass well <unclear> word</unclear>\n\n<$A>  as a foul is committed by Barnes on

uh it's taken short by Malcolm comes\n\nthrough to Dunn\n gets always from Niel but there were too\n\nmany Arnett Garden's defenders back and he had nowhere to go\n Given away by Chin-Sue\n Edwards with a shot\n Never looked like he was going to hit it on target\n Scooped the ball to his right\n He was coming in at an angle towards goal from the left hand side\n\nimmediately behind the ball and you could feel that he wasn't comfortable\n\nwith that angle because he would have to keep the ball straight with the\n\ninstep immediately behind the ball his whole leg immediately behind the ball\n\nand uh most players like to kick from    a side eh\n\napproach and he scooped the ball with that side approach away for a goal kick\n Here is uh Chin-Sue lobbing the ball down the right hand side\n to be eh\n\nview is blocked for the moment\n who will take the throw\n\nhimself\n Down the left hand side Hill comes across\n Chin-Sue jumps over him but it falls kindly for Hill\n to\n\nget it to Dunn\n Niel gets a deflection and then Barnes comes across and knocks it\n\naway for<,> a throw-in but Seba United looking more dangerous on the attack\n a throw-in is taken by Hill straight\n\nto Clarke\n Clarke's return pass to Hill is not a particularly good one and\n\nBarnes is able to get there first but Hill has another throw<,,> uh ten yards\n\naway from the corner flag left hand side of

possession\n Now it's with Malcolm\n Malcolm slides it forward for Hill\n Hill chips it with his back to the intended target\n\n\nBrown was there but uh not close enough to where the pass went\n Here is uh Boyd trying to go down the left flank\n Runs into Mcnish and so it's a throw-in for Arnett\n Taken by Boyd himself inside to Chin-Sue\n Chin-Sue a lofted pass over to the right hand side for Blair\n Niel screaming down the right flank again\n The ball does come to him this time\n It needs a good cross\n He's down to the byline\n Here comes a cross\n Too much power on it\n It's going way past the far post\n Knocked up by McNish\n Overhead kick in towards the penalty area\n Comes straight across the penalty area to Scott and Scott calmly\n\nout to Clarke\n Now then three against three and a good ball played over to the\n\nright by Dunn\n Collins has left his goal and he will go way over to the left hand\n\nside and hammers the ball out of play over the chain link fence out towards\n\nthe tower blocks and away for a throw-in\n He was making no mistake and now it's Clarke going forward plays\n\nit over to that right hand side and Brown pushing it back\n Looking to get it back into the path of Clarke but too much weight\n\non the pass\n You wonder what these guys practice\n Here is Hill now stabs it forward for Clarke\n He should\n Oh and the tackle comes in from Wilson\n\n\nloud-noise-on-recordingbecause Clarke was into the penalty area and it\n\nwas a good challenge in the end by Wilson\n Malcolm going down the left hand side pulled down just outside

{'text': "<$A>  Demar Phillips Rudolph Austin Evan Taylor Andy Williams Marlon\n\nKing and Luton Shelton\n Geoffrey your take on the Jamaican team to begin with\n\n<$B>  Well one thing is certain uhm the coach has gone for players\n\nwho can defend very well and although he says he's gonna play four four two I\n\nthink you might find in the first half we have two holding players in\n\nmidfield giving Williams and <unclear> word(s)</unclear> more freedom to roam\n\nby having two defensive midfield players just protecting the back four\n\n\nas<,> you know how they always say that's what it takes to get into a game\n\nbefore you can actually make an adjustment\n This is a very serious game\n It's an official game\n You can't take any opponent lightly\n We're not expecting Jamaica to falter here at all because based upon\n\nthe Bahamas uhm two or three games that they've played up to date\n Overall I think we should win and if we don't by at least three\n\nclear goals I'd be a little bit surprised\n\n<$A>  national anthem and\n\nnow the Jamaican national anthem\n\n\nta  we'll take a quick break and then we'll come right\n\nback\n in the all of\n\nthe way he can\n hit song in\n\nJamaica<,> Ian Andrews\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  believe that he's actually done\n\nthat on some kind of recording  along already but it's almost become\n\npart and parcel of football here at the national stadium   \n\nthe national anthem and we wanted our listeners   \n\nto get a feel of what that is like\n Geoffrey is just looking through the Jamaican team\n I'm a little surprised to be honest with you that Evan Taylor is\n\nstarting\n\n\nfrom Westmoreland\n a month ago he was virtually unknown as far as the\n\nnational programme is concerned and the coach came saw him liked him and he's\n\nin the setup here for the Reggae Boyz\n\n<$B>  Yeh I'm not saying I'm not also surprised but what I admire\n\nabout Simoes he's all too willing to give young talent an opportunity\n\n\nword(s)</unclear> but definitely although in the next round  \n\n when we have Honduras now as qualified\n Canada will qualify cos they were leading some three nil at half\n\ntime\n Mexico is struggling\n I don't think you're gonna see him play in those games unless he\n\nhas shown marked improvement but uhm to give him credit uhm  \n\n he is there and we just have to back him until hopefully\n\nsomething does not really uhm go correct\n\n<$A>  The players are just doing their warm-up on the field\n Just a run through the officials for\n\nyou\n in a quick while\n Mauricio Navarro from Canada the referee\n The assistant referees are Osvaldo Vergara also from Canada and Joe\n\nFletcher also from Canada\n So it's an all Canadian line up as far as the officials are\n\nconcerned\n The other surprise selection for me Geoffrey is Andy Williams\n\n\nabout a year and a half two years ago\n We thought he was gone dusted and buried as far as national\n\nrepresentation is concerned but we are seeing Simoes giving youthful uhm\n\ntalent a chance to expose    we're also seeing\n\nhim calling back the old timers as well\n\n<$B>  Well you have to keep in mind that Andy Williams does play in\n\nthe M L S so he's active to some extent and the most important factor here is\n\nthat uhm we do not possess a very good playmaker and possibly Simoes has\n\ndecided that bring back Andy and ask him to do that role which he had done\n\nvery well\n\n\noverall think that's it's a big side and uh as this team quite frankly here\n\nis made up of a lot of uhm college students of the U W I so when you really\n\nlook at the overall picture we should win comfortable but football is a funny\n\ngame\n\n<$A> \n\nBahamas football players uh led by Brazilian Neider Dos Santos so both teams\n\nhere are coached by Brazilians\n He has been coaching them for just about a year and a half\n He has some coaching experience\n such\n\nas the Cayman Islands and Guyana along with clubs in Oman Qatar and\n\nTunisia\n The kick-off is about to go off any time now\n team in bright blue\n They'll be kicking from left to right the Jamaicans from right to\n\nleft\n There's the kick-off and we are underway here and as far as world\n\ncup football is concerned\n The Jamaicans will win a throw deep inside their own half as a long\n\nsearching ball intended for Michael Bethel of Bahamas didn't get to him\n Here's the Jamaicans with the ball\n Ian Goodison rejuvenated back in the Jamaican side\n He makes a pass over to the right-hand side and Jermaine Taylor for\n\nJamaica gets his first touch\n Tyrone Marshall playing in the right back gets the ball\n He makes a long ball across the field trying to pick out Luton\n\nShelton\n Much too long for Shelton\n the header gets the ball into touch so the\n\nJamaicans with a throw midway the half of the Bahamas to be taken by the\n\ndreadlocked captain<,> Ricardo Fuller\n He goes back in defence\n He almost always finds Ian Goodison and Goodison goes all the way\n\nback    and finds Taylor as well\n Game at this stage after forty-five seconds looking very slow and\n\nmethodical\n can't get to him but a\n\nheader by Bahamas heading the other way and a throw again for Jamaica\n minute gone it looks\n\nto me as if the Jamaicans are<,,> hoping to just uhm get early goal\n Here's Gardner inside the box\n but he wins a corner does he\n He did well Geoffrey Maxwell to weasel his way past two defenders\n\nbut then the ball<,> dropping on the right foot\n He really doesn't shoot well with the right foot and in the end I\n\ndon't know    what's  up\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  is\n\nthat the uhm<,> opposing team just looked to me to be totally out of sorts\n\nbecause they're playing against Jamaica plus they have not played in front of\n\na crowd this   size\n\n<$A>  a chance for Jamaica and off the bar\n finding\n\nhimself in some very unfamiliar territory\n\n What are we seeing here after a minute forty-six\n Jamaicans could have been two goals up\n\n<$B>  If we cannot win this game by at least six goals our score in\n\nthe first fifteen minutes  two then\n\nsomething is wrong because this team is totally out of depth as far as I'm\n\nconcerned\n just a\n\nmatter of time you know\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Bahaman team clearing\n\n <- >   hastily out of defence\n\n\nfor Marlon King\n Marlon King inside to Andy Williams\n Balls comes over\n Oh Luton Shelton could not get the header and the Bahamans in\n\ntrouble\n Here is a chance for Demar Phillips\n He gets his first cross\n He's on top of the box\n He beats his man but is forced to go wide\n Geoffrey the Jamaicans all over Bahamas after two minutes\n The Jamaicans two and a quarter chances you'd have to say and it's\n\nexcitement here at the national stadium\n Here's Luton Shelton controls one inside the box comes out front\n\nfinds Rudolph Austin with a shot wide and the Jamaicans are all over the  team nil all after three minutes but Geoffrey the Jamaicans have\n\nstarted<,> very very business like here\n\n<$B>  Well this is what you have to do\n You are playing against a team that is less in ability than you\n You need to get at them very quickly unsettle them put in a few\n\nshots on target which has been done\n Jamaican team is very positive in their approach\n\n\nBahamas' team's a little bit out of depth in comparison to us but overall\n\nI think what they are gonna do is to play for at least a half an hour  or\n\nwith chance see if they can avoid a goal scoring and then the game might\n\nsettle down\n\n<$A>  Three minutes gone nil all the score line\n Ricardo Gardner makes a serious challenge up front and finds\n\nShelton who is fouled\n this man is pulling me\n\ndown\n\n I call it foul the referee didn't and it's Bahamas trying to break\n\ntheir way through\n Tyrone Marshall breaks up the play and actually that was Taylor all\n\nthe way back to Donovan Ricketts\n\n\n<- > the  his own half\n Tyrone Marshall dribbles down towards the right hand side cuts\n\ninside nice  so the crowd likes that\n Makes a good pass up front\n on top\n\nof the box but he's forced to go all the way back\n Tyrone Marshall outside to Ricardo Gardner\n Gardner makes a nice pass down field toward Demar Phillips\n Demar Phillips on top of the box\n Gardner makes a run to the left gets the ball dribbles inside the\n\nbox makes a cross\n\n start for Jamaica\n the Jamaicans still in possession on\n\ntop of the box\n Goodison down field\n This could be interesting\n\n Williams makes a pass inside\n\n ball Geoffrey\n acute after he\n\ngot that pass\n The goalkeeper did well to block the angle and Marlon King hit the\n\nball straight to the goalkeeper\n Three and a half chances in four

a matter of time but this is where we have to be careful\n We're getting chances\n We're not putting them away\n Sometime it works against you\n\n<$A>  There's a corner kick to be taken by the Jamaican team\n Ricardo Gardner the captain goes all the way over to the right\n\nhand side\n The stadium is abuzz here\n They suspect that something will happen\n Pretty soon the talks of goal going up\n Ricardo Gardner with a corner\n\n\nBahamas' players clear it away and it's Vanderlord or\n\nVanderpool gets it away and now the Bahamas heading out of\n\ndefence\n The ball will come back to the

will live to breathe easily\n They have come over the half time Geoffrey only for four point two\n\nseconds of the five minutes we have played so far and it's all Jamaica so far\n\nbut still no goals\n\n<$A>  I believe that the plan that I mention earlier I think this\n\nis what they are doing just looking at how they are setting up themselves but\n\nthey are setting up themselves for a big fall because they have to maintain a\n\ncertain level of discipline and tactical awareness\n The Jamaican team is far more athletical far more technical than\n\nthemselves\n\n\nOrville with some uhm

{'text': "<$A> \n Sorry about that\n\n\ntime from now\n Ian Andrews is there singing the national anthem but with me\n\nGeoffrey Maxwell\n Geoffrey the last time St Vincent were here they knocked us out of\n\nthe Caribbean Cup at the time\n Should be a kind of a grudge match but whatever happens one expects\n\nthat we'll have a good football game this evening\n\n<$B>  I think so because when you look overall at both teams quite\n\nfrankly uhm this is a game that    there is a\n\nfeeling of process uhm\n The St Vincent team said that they came here with seven overseas\n\nbased players and their two top players Wesley Charles who plays from\n\nGalloway in Ireland and also Wesley Jones who play from that big team in\n\nPortugal Porto uhm apparently is not here but they have five other player and\n\n their starting eleven <unclear> words</unclear>\n\n we're talking three players two that play in Malaysia  \n\n a defender a forward and the other one plays in Trinidad for\n\nCaledonia and I would think that it's a more of a balanced team that they're\n\nputting out there\n as we spoke\n\nearlier  , \n I think that Ricketts will be in goal Simon Ford will play sweeper\n Goodison Adrian Reid be the two man markers\n Demar Phillips and Gardner will play on the flanks and a young\n\nplayer from Reno Evan Taylor who I saw about four years or three to four\n\nyears ago and I felt he was a very good defender\n He has the ability to play in there\n He's going to with the big boys tonight and we have Austin and Andy\n\nWilliams that has been brought back\n I think the inclusion of Andy Williams is really what's been\n\nhappening in Jamaica\n Everywhere people had been calling for a playmaker\n Andy is the closest thing to what we have right now\n\n\nagain up front\n So when you look at uhm the Jamaican team one could say it's a\n\npretty strong team that is out there and of course we would like to start off\n\nwith a win\n With both teams coming here nobody wants to lose but this is a\n\ntesting time because there are    two more\n\ngames to go\n One against Grenada in Grenada and the other against Trinidad\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Alright so there you have heard it\n The Jamaican starting line up Ricketts Gardner Phillips Simon Ford\n be on him\n new recruit from Kilmarnock in Scotland\n Did speak to him on the Sport World when he arrived\n We were actually the first media house to talk to him\n\n\nthe Reggae Boyz\n Of course Adrian Reid as Geoffrey Maxwell would have mention is\n\nalso in the starting eleven\n He was the N V P in the latest Premier League\n voted the most\n\nimpressive footballer in the Premier League has been given a chance at the\n\nbig level\n Ian Goodison continues to maintain his position in the centre half\n\nposition and then Andy Williams brought back\n Rudolph Austin continues to maintain his place\n He's now a bona fide member of the starting line-up and then Evan\n\nTaylor that young player from Reno whom the coach speaks very very highly of\n All eyes will be on him as well and then Marlon King and Ricardo\n\nFuller as the strikers up front\n Uhm a little surprise Geoffrey that Luton Shelton hasn't started\n\n<$B>  i\n\ni  if I have a slight feeling of how Rene would be\n\nthinking\n\n\nstrikers\n Two that possible can start the game and two that could come on and\n\nfinish more stronger\n in\n\nthe second half because defenders would be a little bit tired\n He'd have that pace that he carries\n part\n\nwhere\n King is a very good holding player\n Fuller is known to dribble\n He can beat the odd player uhm although he has not played well in\n\nhis last two or three outings here\n\n\nthe forwards at this moment to see who can give him something early\n\nand who can come on and increase the tempo\n\n<$A>  Let's just run through the St Vincent team for you\n It's Melvin Andrews in goal\n Then there's Roy Richards Oscar Nero Kendall Velox Sean Glynn\n\nCornelius Huggins\n\n And then Millon Prescott\n Then there's Theon Gordon Emerald George Darren Francis and Marlon\n\nJames\nuh I tell you about him in a little\n\nwhile<,>\n Floyd that the professor writes is our\n\nproducer he will just give us that information in a little bit but uhm<,>\n\nshould make for an interesting game and when we spoke to the manager John \n\nRolex uh last night he said that they will come to play football Geoffrey\n and you\n\nsuspect<,> that they might be giving a better showing here than what most\n\nJamaicans would be uhm maybe expecting\n\n<$B>  Well they have to because their next opponent at the world cup\n\nlevel on the fifteenth uhm of June is Canada\n One of the teams that I have selected to go forward into the second\n\nround because I feel that Canada is gonna be playing  it straight\n I watched them against Brazil\n game\n\nagainst them but you usually lift yourself against big opponents\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  team of\n\ncourse will have to try and overcome the idea that they defeated Jamaica uhm\n\nsome time ago in a two one\n\n\nthey must understand what they are playing for because everybody\n\nwants to play in the world cup qualifier so at this point in time you're\n\ngonna be expecting a hard game from them\n seven players\n\nwho are playing overseas but only    three out\n\nof that   five will start\n\n<$A>  and there's the kick off\n The kick off made by St Vincent\n They'll be kicking from left to right from where we sit here in the\n\ngrandstand\n The ball given away and Goodison makes his first touch for Jamaica\n\nmakes a pass over to his right picks out Andy Williams\n Evan Taylor gets his first touch\n The youngster from Reno makes a pass over to the right for Adrian\n\nReid playing in the right looks like he's playing in the right back position\n Back to Taylor\n Taylor in the middle of the park makes a good pass up front picks\n\nout Fuller\n long ball downfield by Reid\n Fuller jumps a little bit early but looks like Andy Williams\n\ncontrols well\n Williams makes a good pass over to the left for Ricardo Gardner\n\ndeep inside    the St Vincent half\n\nrather\n Here's Andy Williams\n Somebody's down a Jamaican is down and Andy Williams will just kick\n\nthe ball into touch and allow the referee time to regroup and uh give some\n\nattention\n\n<$B>  Well at that point as you can see there's some uh one minute\n\nso far into play and unfortunate\n We're hoping that there's not a serious injury\n Both players went for the ball\n if\n\nthat's the correct word    for what has happened but\n\nlet's hope it's nothing serious\n He's up on his legs he might be a little bit stiff a little bit\n\nswollen but I'm pretty certain at this level where you're trying to cement\n\nyour place\n He's gonna run it out\n He's gonna run it out\n\n<$A>  teams\n\nGeoffrey you feel will be taking this one pretty serious\n in a mere weeks from now and\n\nplayers will want to be impressing so that<,> they will catch the eye of\n\ntheir respective national coaches and it's St Vincent now who will take the\n\nthrow\n Clearly they'll give back the ball to the Jamaicans\n\nand<,,>\n Not sure what was happening there because what happened Geoffrey is\n\nthat the Jamaicans did kick away the ball<,> or allow the ball to run and\n\nthen   the  the St Vincent team\n The referee incidentally is Alfred Whittaker from Cayman\n in\n\nthe last few days or in the last few matches\n\n\nas well\n rather\n Let's just watch now as the action deep inside the half of St\n\nVincent\n We're watching as Marlon King he can't control\n He keeps it in play\n Now over to Gardner\n Can Gardner get inside the box\n He does just trying to juggle past his man couldn't do so and it's\n\na corner kick for the Jamaican team\n Jamaicans have started well here Geoffrey Maxwell\n\n<$B>  Well definitely what we can see from the start of the play is\n\nthat the Jamaicans are much more energetic and sharper very quick into attack\n\npressing back St Vincent team whilst I think the St Vincent team is playing a\n\nlittle bit deep to see how much pressure they can absorb\n\n<$A>  Marlon King gets the ball after the ball was ricocheted\n\nsquares it inside the box\n It'll be cleared away by the St Vincent team that has really\n\nlooked a little slow off the mark\n Let's just watch as Sean Glynn for St Vincent he allows the ball\n\nto run into touch and it's Jamaicans with a   \n\nthrow deep inside the St Vincent half\n Gardner makes a pass up front comes off his man and Gardner will\n\nwin a throw midway the St Vincent half\n\n Goodison just about on the halfway line comes all the way back\n\ndeep and picks out uh Demar Phillips who is playing in the central defensive\n\narea\n\n The Jamaicans just playing around with it at the back\n Goodison makes a long pass down field hopes to catch Marlon King\n\non the run\n King is taken down to ground and the Jamaicans will win a free\n\nkick ten twelve yards away from the eighteen yard area on the left hand side\n let's see\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Well what I can't understand is why Goodison's making so many\n\nlong balls from so deep when St Vincent is actually sitting back obviously to\n\nabsorb some pressure\n So these long aimless balls as I would think some forty fifty\n\nyards  Orville\n\n\n<$A>  a free kick by Williams that's headed away\n\ncontrolled by Gardner\n\n\ngood I can tell you that\n\n The heads go up and headed away and St Vincent with one rare touch\n Marlon James over on the left-hand side\n throw\n Three minutes and forty-nine seconds gone according to our watch\n\nand we've basically seen a game where the entire four minutes you'd have to\n\nsay are maybe about eighty percent of the time that we have already played is\n\nplayed in the St Vincent half\n just over the halfway line inside\n\nthe Jamaican half and let's see what they make of this one\n Four minutes nine seconds gone according to our watch and it's St\n\nVincent nil Jamaica nil here<,,> uh let's just watch\n Looks to be Millon Prescott with the free kick\n He floats it up towards the edge of the box\n The heads will go up but Goodison will

little typical of\n\nthe below level English team type of play but I think that what needs to be\n\ndone right now we need to go back very deep with the ball  Orville and\n\npull them out of their defensive positions\n\n<$A>  Watch the Jamaicans with a free kick now but then uh St Vincent\n\nwith the ball\n Good good play that from Marlon James\n watching but\n\nthen the Jamaicans regroup\n Goodison back to his goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts\n Five minutes gone nil all the score line\n eases the ball to his right for Demar Phillips who\n\ngoes to his left finds Goodison<,,>\n pretty\n\nmuch his own way upfront to the youngster Taylor from Reno\n over on the right\n\nhand side that is Adrian Reid\n Now Reid makes a lateral pass to Goodison\n The Jamaicans just bouncing around at the

he can't\n Yes he does now and then that's a horrid clearance from St\n\nVincent<,> and ha ha\n Geoffrey Maxwell you describe all that\n to start quite attacking and we're not\n\nseeing too much from the St Vincent team at this point in time\n It is six minutes inside the contest and let's just watch this free\n\nkick or this corner kick to be taken now<,> by<,> looks to be Andy Williams\n\nwho is    very involved in the contest\n He takes it short to Gardner who then back to Williams squares\n looks like it\n\nglances    the crossbar Geoffrey Maxwell<,,> and the\n\nJamaicans came within a whisker of a goal that time<,> but somebody must have\n\ngot a hand or a head to it otherwise because it's another corner kick<,>\n It's Andy Williams with Gardner standing close to him gets the\n\nreturn ball\n\n\nedge of the box\n Demar Phillips will have a crack\n He doesn't yet\n Now he squares it inside\n The heads go up\n and it comes all the way over to the right\n\nsquared back inside by Marlon King just too high and all kinds of things\n\nhappening here Geoffrey\n Seven minutes gone no goals but it's all happening here for Jamaica\n\n<$B>  a little\n\ndisappointed  Orville\n I have to say that frankly because within two three minutes we can\n\nsee that the St Vincent team is definitely not in our class as far as a\n\nnational team is concerned\n They are playing very deep\n They must be aware of what Jamaica ability and athletic ability is\n\nabout and I'm just surprised that we are giving away the ball so easily where\n\nI think we should be dominating in games of this nature\n\n\n  as they say you have to give teams time to warm\n\nup\n I always look for that magical twenty minutes before trying to\n\nassess the team but definitely  Orville within two three minutes this\n\nteam is not in our class\n If we don't win this game at least a minimum of three goals I think\n\nit will be a disappointing performance\n\n<$A>  Let's just watch\n It's Ian Goodison with the football for Jamaica midway his own half\n He's always asking people to run\n He goes to the far right hand side this time, and he finds\n\nAdrian Reid who makes a long pass downfield\n He picks out Gardner\n was a little\n\nbit too long playing in that right back position\n Geoffrey Maxwell that's been a problem position for Jamaica in the\n\nlast few seasons\n that the youngster\n\nfrom Portmore Eric Vernon may well be the best right back we have in Jamaica\n He isn't here\n A foul on Fuller on top of the box and the Jamaicans will win a\n\nfree kick ten twelve yards away Geoffrey\n But I think that that right back position that we keep trying\n\npeople\n I would look to Eric Vernon for sure\n But the Jamaicans will win a free kick\n Geoffrey will talk to us about that\n\n<$B>  Well no doubt but what has happened now is that the way in\n\nwhich I think Simoes is looking at this game he wants an early goal\n This is very obvious to me because we are playing very bad football\n We're giving away at least six passes out of ten\n just don't know what's the\n\napproach\n So I think it's an early goal they're looking and then possibly the\n\nteam will settle down\n\n<$A>  Alright Andy Williams look to be standing up over it\n Looks like he has not lost the beat this Andy Williams\n He's slipped back into this Reggae Boyz team and has assumed the\n\nrole of the play maker\n and then we will be back\n Let's just watch this free kick before we go for the break\n Andy Williams kicks and the goalkeeper does well to save it\n Good kick\n We'll take a break\n\n Alright welcome back to the national stadium\n\n\nfrom Andy Williams\n Uhm did have the direction but the goalkeeper Melvin Andrews can\n\nsay he had that covered all the time\n\n<$B>  The intention was good because from how Andy lined up himself\n\nit was obvious he was gonna play for the near post because the St Vincent\n\ndefenders seem to be a little bit short and I think it was the correct thing\n\nhe did<,>\n\n<$A> \n They have all the possession the Jamaicans\n Nine minutes forty-five seconds gone\n Still nil all\n with the football\n\n Looks like Adrian Reid would have switched position with Demar\n\nPhillips here Geoffrey Maxwell<,> because Adrian Reid now over on the left\n\nhand side looks to be playing now<,>  ,  uhm\n\n<$B>  a\n\nsweeper so to speak but when you\n\n<$A>  Certain on the left side of the central defensive area\n\n<$B>  When you do play with three at the back you're gonna find that\n\nthat three has to rotate a lot once you're gonna play the system they are\n\nplaying\n\n<$A>  There's a long ball up field to Marlon King if he can get\n\nthere\n No he can't but he's forced the defender into an error but the\n\nreferee says   that maybe some<,>\n called against Marlon King so the\n\nJamaicans will give up a free kick deep deep inside the St Vincent half\n Ten minutes gone ten minutes thirty seconds gone and it's still nil\n\nall here\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  St Vincent with an attack over on the far left hand side\n One of the few times that they would have made an impact\n They've tried to go through\n They can't and if they can't this time either and another whistle\n\non the play the Jamaicans will win a free kick just ten yards or so inside\n\nthe St Vincent half\n\n<$B>  you have to ask yourself\n\nuhm this is a team that's gonna be playing a world cup qualifier I'm talking\n\nSt Vincent against Canada and you have to sit here and  \n\n I wonder if they understand what they are going into  \n\nbecause<,> I

team\n One is a good sweeper since George Brown and the other one\n\nbasically is in midfield which uhm I still say to this day I have not seen a\n\nreplacement for Winston Anglin and I think this is what possible uh Simoes is\n\nlooking at to try and fill these    three areas a\n\ngood defensive midfield player and also    a very\n\nefficient play maker and I know we have always talked about

Journal of the Sociology of Language in which she has an\n\nimportant paper on the social context of African language continuities in\n\nJamaica<,>\n And it is particularly important on occasion like this to mention\n\nthis paper<,> because in it<,> what she looks at is the Akkan language as it\n\nis retained or was retained among the Maroons and she also looks at Bantu\n\nlanguage forms in Kumina<,>\n So her research is directly applicable to this conference and it\n\ntherefore    gives me great pleasure to formally\n\nask her to speak as chairperson<,> of this occasion thank you ,\n\n<$B> \n the colonels\n\nin particular<,> researchers in the audience<,> students<,,>\n I know it is a usual opening to start with\n\nsomething like it gives me very great pleasure to be associated with and for\n\nthis to be a mere formulaic opening but when I use these words this morning\n\nthey really mean something<,> because I consider this<,> a very special\n\noccasion<,>\n\n\nin terms of<,> this kind of approach<,> to history<,,>\n been fertile and\n\nstomping ground for researchers and academics<,>\n actually been called from the field and\n\nfrom the field literally in some cases<,> to sit as partners in the matter of\n\ndiscussing and analyzing their heritage<,> albeit their heritage<,> and\n\nthis<,> is certainly a first at U W I<,>\n but rarely called to the ranks of\n\nthose who<,> inform<,>\n and the voice of that call is Dr.\n\nKofi Agorsah and I also<,> join in<,> thanking Dr. Agorsah for this vision\n\nand in congratulating him on achieving this<,,> \n\n\nthe<,> members of the head table<,> whom you've not met yet<,>\n I am\n\ngoing to welcome you<,> Professor Barry Higman<,> a scholar of no mean\n\norder<,> <,>\n Colonel Harris of the Moore Town\n\nMaroons<,> <,> Maroon historian  par\n\nexcellence<,> Colonel Wright<,> of the Accompong Maroons<,> <,> Mr Manroe<,,>    state\n\nsecretary and custodian of the famous Maroon peace treaty of\n\nseventeen thirty-nine<,> and of course you've heard from Dr<,>\n\nCooper<,> from whom you will hear later in the proceedings and I'm sure it\n\nwill be a very stimulating presentation<,>\n did hear what\n\nCarolyn had to say about me earlier on<,>\n because my\n\nonly claim to fame these days is as someone who used to do this<,> or used to\n\ndo that<,> in the past<,>\n in matters of this\n\nnature is as a lapsed something or other\n Lapsed linguist perhaps\nBut the\n\ntruth is I was rather pleased<,> to be beckoned from my voluntary exile in\n\nadministration at East Street<,> to be a part of this morning's<,> colourful\n\nopening ceremony<,> and pleased also to associate the Institute of Jamaica\n\nwith this symposium<,>\n And I very warmly endorse the welcome already extended to all by\n\nProfessor Higman<,> and especially the welcome<,> to the Maroons<,>\n I'm really very pleased to see the students because I think it is\n\nvery important that they be a part of this exercise <,,>\n and\n\nvolumes of material<,> for several theses and learned dissertations of many a\n\nscholar<,>\n And some of these scholars are here in our midst this morning and\n\nyou'll hear from them during the course of today and tomorrow<,>\n And they've come from places far afield to share their findings\n\nwith us<,>\n and the oral deliveries of the Maroons\n\nthemselves<,> will address several of the issues relating to Maroon history\n\nand culture<,,>\n that\n\nwill be included<,> and to see areas outside of Jamaica being included for\n\nexample<,> ah papers on Maroons in Mexico<,> in Columbia<,> I hope<,> I\n\nhaven't seen the speaker yet but I'm hoping he will turn up<,> uhm very\n\ninteresting work on eh  El Palenque de San Baptisio in\n\nColumbia<,> and on<,> Surinam<,,>\n In fact I've even noticed that there is a presentation by a\n\ncomputer scientist so the field is not without its high-tech <,,>\n I'm sure still several\n\nareas of Maroon history yet to be researched<,> and room for sharpening much\n\nof the existing analyses and<,> I think opportunities like these where\n\nscholars meet and where the scribal tradition meets the oral tradition are\n\nvalued opportunities and opportunities from which<,> we should derive maximum\n\nmileage<,> because Maroon societies by their very nature and by their\n\nhistory<,> provide<,> an excellent framework for studying issues relating<,>\n\nto Afro-American cultures and societies<,> and for studying the processes of\n\nsocio-cultural change<,> in the early contact between African cultures<,> and\n\nEuropean cultures<,,>\n and\n\nto my mind<,> the questions are often more interesting than some of the\n\nanswers proffered<,,>\n of Afro-American cultures as mosaic\n\ncultures<,> with a little pocket of this here and a little pocket of that\n\nthere<,> and yet another pocket of something else<,> over there<,>\n\n\na    a pathological version of European\n\nculture<,> with the culture of each area of the black diaspora showing\n\ndiffering degrees of aberration<,> or distance<,> from Europe<,,> Maroon\n\nsocieties<,> being in the main the more<,> aberrant varieties<,,>\n is this too static a\n\nview of culture<,> too mechanical a view<,> a view which belies the inherent\n\ndynamism of culture<,> and relegates cultures with such so-called\n\nsurvivals<,> to the status of fossil cultures<,>\n only relevant in defining the\n\ninterplay between African<,> and non-African forms<,>\n Do we not also need to look at syncretism resulting from the\n\ncontact between diverse African forms<,>\n are Afro- American cultures Neo-African\n\ncultures<,> their distinctiveness from European cultures and their affinity\n\nto Africa<,> being a factor of what some anthropologists have termed their\n\nfidelity to underlying African cultural principles<,> to the fact of the\n\nexistence of a common core<,> of basic assumptions and understandings shared\n\nby Africans in any new world colony<,> rather than to any specific or\n\nisolated retention from specific African cultures<,>\n and there are of course\n\nmany more questions than these and nor are these questions by any means being\n\nposed for the first time<,,>\n\n\n necessarily mutually exclusive nor necessarily in conflict<,> nor\n\ncan most of the answers be definitive<,> but must be subject to review<,> as\n\n   research unearths new evidence and I think\n\nthe deliberations here<,> over the rest of today and all of tomorrow<,> on\n\nseveral aspects of Maroon culture<,> Maroon music language political\n\norganization on the archaeological evidence of  <- >  ah ah\n\n Maroon material   culture<,> I think these deliberations will\n\nserve to sharpen our perspective<,> on<,> related issues<,> such as the ones\n\nthat are mentioned<,>\n the presentation\n\nof the original copy<,> of the famous<,> or infamous<,> peace treaty of\n\nseventeen thirty-nine<,>\n Due to circumstances beyond our control we are not able to present\n\nthis original document this morning<,>\n I'm sure will\n\nbe pleased to<,> say a few words and to greet you<,> so I now call on Mr\n\nManroe to<,> greet the audience \n\n\n\n<$C> \n\n over there\n\nthey're happy to be here too<,,>\n will perhaps\n\nstir a little interest<,,> \n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$C>  inhabitants\n\nthe aborigines  <- > you<,>  many

{'text': "<$A> \n nineteen\n\nsixty-five and nineteen sixty-eight<,> and who was in fact on campus<,>\n\nduring Sir Frank Worrel's tenure<,> as warden of Irvine Hall<,> it is my very\n\nspecial pleasure this evening<,> to been asked to give this the second\n\nlecture in this Sir Frank Worrel Memorial<,> public lecture series<,,>\n Sir Frank Worrel was not\n\nonly a great cricketer<,> but he was also a great leader who inspired\n\nexcellence from all who came in contact with him<,>\n As a batsman in the classic mould of elegant stroke play he had no\n\npeer or equal<,>\n To watch him at the wicket as Cedric suggested was to observe poetry\n\nin motion<,>\n\n representing\n\nus in fact in cricket<,>\n\n as a J L P representative and\n\nmade an important contribution<,> to the deliberations of that house<,>\n was doing very poorly in\n\nsports<,>\n Irvine Hall became a\n\nformidable force in campus sports<,>\n He in fact did the same thing in Boys Town where under his\n\ncaptaincy that senior cup team<,> with a lot of talent but very little\n\ndiscipline emerged as a champion team winning the senior cup in successive\n\nyears under Sir Frank's leadership<,>\n a cricket team\n\nrepresenting a ghetto community rather than Kingston or Melbourne tells us a\n\nmouthful about Sir Frank's commitment to and faith in the ordinary Jamaican\n\nand Caribbean people and about his abiding faith that with right leadership\n\nthey're all capable of achieving high standards of excellence<,>\n It is Sir Frank Warrel's imaginative and creative leadership that\n\nmoulded the talented West Indian cricket team<,> into world beaters<,> and\n\nthe number one cricketing team in the world<,>\n for this\n\nopportunity to make my small contribution to<,> this lecture series<,>\n on the future of the\n\nEnglish-speaking Caribbean<,> and try to evaluate our development prospects\n\nas we enter the twenty-first century<,> as a region<,,>\n\n regionalism and\n\nfederation<,> is not a concept that  enjoys a lot of currency and\n\nsupport<,>\n Our opposition party leader treats the whole idea of regionalism as\n\na kind of political football<,>\n but we see no evidence that\n\nthey're really serious about it<,>\n We have had commissions\n We have had deliberations\n\n But public opinion at this point in time is not very committed to\n\nthis concept<,>\n The last time we did a survey on it we found that only a minority\n\nof Jamaicans<,> have any kind of strong sentiment or feeling<,> about\n\nregionalism<,>\n political\n\nintegration or   stronger  economic integration\n\nwith the Eastern Caribbean<,>\n those of us particularly who\n\nshare a regional perspective of the Caribbean and recognize that we have a\n\nvery uphill task ahead of us in trying to build<,> strong public opinion\n\nsupport<,> for the concept of<,> enlarging the regional framework for\n\nCaribbean development<,,>\n I think it is clear to many of us that central to our development\n\nprospects<,> are going to be the following concerns<,> how well we manage our\n\neconomies on a regionwide basis<,,> how far we are willing to share power<,>\n\npolicy and planning<,> in unifying the economies of the region<,> how far our\n\npoliticians<,> and politics will respond to the urgent need<,> for greater\n\nCaribbean unity<,> and integration<,> and how far we as a region<,> attempt\n\nto manage our fears in a rational fashion<,,> also how far we as a Caribbean\n\npeople acknowledge the central importance of regional unity in the\n\ndevelopment tasks that face us in the twenty-first century<,> and finally how\n\nfar we are able to preserve democracy and political stability<,> in this\n\nregion of ours<,,>\n our\n\nproblems and prescribe some solutions within the framework of a broad\n\nstrategy of regional unity<,> which is an imperative we cannot abandon<,>\n\n The English-speaking Caribbean is the only region among developing\n\ncountries<,> where competitive politics led by civilians and managed by\n\nconstitutions and the rule of law<,> remains intact<,> and has been so on an\n\nuninterrupted basis since independence<,>\n We can therefore tell the world a lot about democratic practice\n\nunder conditions of economic underdevelopment<,>\n And underlying this tradition of democracy has been an enviable\n\nlevel of political stability that makes us unique among the countries\n\ndeveloping along world's rather developing country regions<,,>\n\n\nwith high levels of trade dependence predominate<,,> due to the small size of\n\nour economies<,> and to the inherited legacy<,> of the plantation\n\nstructures<,> also to our later post-war dependence on foreign capital in\n\ntourism<,> manufacturing and mineral production<,,>\n in combining\n\nBritish<,> and Western influences with African and Asian<,> lifestyles values\n\nand cultural moulds<,> to create a unique blending of cultures<,,>\n we're\n\nin fact the most culturally<,> unified region among developing countries<,>\n\nlacking the ethnic diversity of Asia<,> the tribal and ethnic divisions of\n\nAfrica<,> the religious diversity of Asia and Africa<,> the language\n\ndiversity of Asia and Africa<,> and the sharp racial divisions of North\n\nAmerica<,> and South and Central America between people of Indian and African\n\nstock on the one hand and Europeans<,>\n and Indian with a tiny minority of\n\nEuropeans<,> but with the African<,> component predominating\n\noverwhelmingly<,> and the Indians to some extent being integrated into the\n\nsocieties through creolization<,>\n of one of our\n\nnotable anthropologists Professor M G Smith<,> my research suggest\n\ndefinitively that we are the least culturally pluralistic among the\n\ndeveloping country regions<,> and exhibit a high level of cultural unity<,>\n\nin language and religion and ethnicity in westernised values that cut across\n\nboth race and class divisions<,>\n as well as\n\nreligion and sports<,> have been our great cultural unifiers<,>\n assimilates\n\noutside influences<,>\n We have a strong sense of where we stand in relation to the\n\nworld<,> and we are very conscious of our extra- Caribbean ties<,> political\n\nideological social and economic<,,>\n We have never been an entirely inward-looking and parochial culture\n\nas we seek constantly to blend integrate and assimilate a variety of\n\ninfluences which have been fashioned by us into a unique Caribbean way of\n\nlife<,>\n We remain sharply divided between the impulse towards regional\n\nunity and the impulse to go off on our own as separate societies<,>\n\nespecially after the political failure of the West Indies Federation<,> and\n\nthe feeling among our L D Cs that Caricom or economic integration<,> has\n\nserved mainly the interests of the larger territories and their private\n\nsectors<,>\n But as the economic problems of the region have multiplied and as\n\nthe world is being carved up into huge trading blocks<,> and as our own\n\nregion is being organized into<,> the so-called North American Free Trade\n\nArea<,> it is occurring to most of us that we need to forge a strategy of\n\nregional unity<,>\n\n\nthe people of the Caribbean<,,>\n on regional and\n\nhemispheric political and economic issues<,>\n with problems\n\nthat are generic to the region<,> narco-terrorism<,> drug trafficking<,>\n\ncrime and gun-running<,> problems that we can only confront effectively<,> if\n\nour separate regional governments develop<,> common modes of coping with\n\nthese problems<,>\n to\n\nbetter penetrate third country markets whether in Europe Latin America or\n\nNorth America<,>\n\n\ncombining the marketing and business talent of the region<,> in grouped<,>\n\nlarger firms to facilitate our being able to break into overseas markets<,>\n\nby studying what those markets require and organizing smaller Caribbean firms\n\nto produce<,> what can sell in those countries<,,>\n We need to dismantle the infrastructure of expensive island and\n\nterritorial governments<,> merge our political talent into a common pool of\n\nregional political parties<,> and try again<,> at a federation that can\n\ncoordinate plan and implement economic strategies for the whole region<,,>\n We need as well a unified approach to dealing with the multilateral\n\nagencies<,> to strengthen our bargaining power and to band together in\n\ndemanding debt relief and debt forgiveness not only from private banks but\n\nalso from the multilateral lending agencies<,>\n We need to hang together to avoid economic recolonization by\n\nWashington and the I M F<,> in a period when we're so overwhelmed with\n\neconomic problems that we are easy prey for these new forms of imperialism<,>\n from allowing freer movement of\n\ncapital and the development of regional capital markets to stimulate<,>\n\nregionwide investments\n High rates of outward migration among our more educated and younger\n\ncitizens demand that we pool our professional and managerial talents\n\nregionwide to manage the affairs of the Caribbean<,,> in a way which<,>\n\nallows us to compensate for this depletion<,> this constant haemorrhaging and\n\ndepletion<,> of our human resources<,>\n The development of our university must be rescued from creeping\n\nparochialism and insularity<,> by linking it to a renewed effort towards\n\nregional and public<,> administration and new initiatives to finance the\n\nexpansion of higher education in the

set\n\nout very clearly<,> that there would be no financial and other uhm<,> you\n\nknow responsibilities afterwards<,>\n And uhm then those who went through with it found that uh after the\n\nchild was born    they still wanted a\n\nrelationship    with the\n\nwoman and the child uh uh\n couldn't take it that they would\n\nhave no further uhm<,> involvement<,>\n those who were married and\n\nhad done it lived in constant fear<,> of their wives finding out<,>\n\n\nthese men could benefit from some technical assistance from<,> uh Caribbean\n\nmen<,> and that when you begin to look at this   \n\nit it is just a first phase    on the cycle\n\nof    what we call male irresponsibility\n\nbecause when men have learned to deal with that situation<,>    of really being a baby stud a person of

find out that these two large countries\n\nwhen they were moving to superpower status in the world<,> that they were\n\nbeginning to have the same kind    of experience<,>\n If I may just pick another

type of explanations are the explanations which invoke\n\ncapitalism and communism<,> and  what are the\n\npathological results of capitalist society<,>\n uh has one of the most\n\nelegant    and seductive explanations for why it is\n\nuhm women are coming into increasing numbers in the workforce<,>\n capitalist\n\nindustrialized society<,>    has\n\nbrought industrial production<,> modes<,> to domestic goods and services<,>\n And by being able to produce domestic goods and services at\n\naffordable prices<,> where<,> the family can go and through fast food outlets\n\nget their meal<,> through various technological devices do their washing<,>\n\nthrough retail outlets buy their clothes already made<,> uhm through various\n\ntechnological devices do the household chores<,> women are therefore\n\nreleased<,> from their<,> traditional household chores and are available<,>\n\n   to be employed in the marketplace<,>\n they\n\nare less expensive labour<,> than the men who have been there\n have employed\n\nwomen in increasing numbers because by employing them    in these circumstances especially in circumstances\n\nwhere there's a certain de-skilling<,>  <- > of the  of the\n\nlabour force<,> where    the technical\n\nskill of the job is removed from the workmen and put into to equipment and\n\nmachinery<,> then uhm you have the displacement  <,> \n\nof men by women    in the workforce\n it\n\nit  it is a very seductive uhm<,> and and uhm<,> very novel\n\nand uh persuasive explanation<,>\n we could come\n\nto the conclusion that well women are cheaper<,> and because women are\n\ncheaper as labour and you have industrial society which is more advanced<,>\n\nthen you have this phenomenon<,>\n What is interesting when you compare the Soviet Union as a\n\ncentrally planned economy<,> industrialized yes but that has not applied\n\nindustrial production to domestic goods and services because<,> the Soviet\n\nwoman    is one of the most burdened women in the\n\nworld\n but\n\nalso she has    all her household duties to do\n\n She does not have the retail outlets\n\n\n she has to\n\nline up for meat<,> she has to    line up for\n\nmilk<,> for bread<,> for everything<,> so that she is by no means relieved of\n\nher domestic chores\n\n\n   far more women employed  <- > than\n\n than the market economies<,>\n\n\nin the Soviet Union    is double burdened<,>\n\nto the most serious extent fifty-one percent of the labour force in the\n\nSoviet Union is female\n Compare for example to thirty-two percent in the United States\n And all of the countries of Eastern Europe have higher proportions\n\nof women in their economies\n changes that\n\nhave recently    occurred<,> than all of \n\n  the Western industrialized capitalist\n\neconomies<,>\n addition to that those\n\ncentrally planned economies were not seeking to maximize uhm<,> profit<,> and\n\ntherefore use women    as cheap labour<,>\n which mandate equal pay for equal\n\nwork\n\n\nni  in the nineteen twenties that in Soviet law and\n\nconstitution there was not a hint<,> of uhm<,,> sexual discrimination because\n\nwomen had equal rights on all issues and there was an equal pay for equal\n\nwork and this actually takes place\n So when one looks at that one recognizes that this business that\n\nwomen are cheaper that is why they are used in the labour force and this is a\n\nresult of capitalist economies    in\n\nfact uhm it cannot stand the test of comparisons between<,>\n\ncapitalist   \n\neconomies as against centrally planned economies<,> and that one has\n\nto look<,> for    the issue\x18s always raised that this whole problem \n\n  of    the man being absent\n\nfrom the home<,> and not being there<,> to take on his

{'text': "<$A>  here we have a\n\nsituation where<,,> imperial policy is to preserve the market for British\n\nmanufacturers<,> and to do this<,> by imposing a system of discriminatory\n\ncustoms duties against importations from rival manufacturers\n in the nineteen\n\nthirties nineteen forties<,> British motor cars<,> paid a customs duty of\n\nfifteen per cent<,> but United States motor cars<,> and German motor cars\n\npaid a customs duty of twenty-five per cent\n And this policy was generally pursued with a view to discouraging\n\nthe uh uh competition from rival manufacturers\n\n\nto be free<,> to seek the cheapest source<,> for their imports<,>\n\n\nabout<,> the Japanese shoes<,> and the<,> determination of the<,> British\n\ngovernment to protect the market for a Commonwealth product<,>\n although this policy starts off with\n\nprotection of British manufacturers exclusively after nineteen thirty-two it\n\nhas to be modified because of pressure from Australia and Canada<,> and as a\n\nresult of the Ottawa conference the Ottawa agreement<,> expands this policy\n\nto protection of Empire products\n And so you have a situation where Empire products are to be given\n\nthis discriminatory edge against uh other uhm uhm rival manufacturers\n Now here again the class is not united the merchant class because\n\nmany merchants are agents for principals in Britain\n\n\n the system modified\n to find your sources of\n\nnationalism you look not only at the emotional cultural<,> protest and\n\nrebellion against the system<,> of white superiority cultural values and\n\nwhite domination of employment<,> which particularly affects the\n\nintelligentsia the educated people the people capable of administering but\n\nyou can also look in the economic area at how the system of colonialism<,>\n\nadversely affected the manufacturing class and the merchant class\n As far as the workers and small farmers were concerned that was\n\nagain a fairly straightforward and simple uh<,> proposition\n point of\n\nview if the government is formed by persons popularly elected<,,> on    an extensive franchise<,> then<,> one could expect that the\n\nelected representatives<,> will show<,> some greater interest in the\n\nwelfare<,> of the popular masses\n uh there was that\n\ninterest in challenging colonialism<,>\n there\n\nwas the attraction<,> that in the event of political independence the armed\n\nforces of the imperial power would not be available to the big employers in\n\ntimes of industrial unrest<,>\n there were the different sources of nationalistic ideas\n this last point is in\n\ntheory<,> because although this is really applicable to the rest of\n\nthe Caribbean area    the uh other colonies in the\n\nregion it does not apply initially to Jamaica<,>\n\n that emerges in the\n\nleadership of the trade union organization that emerges in nineteen\n\nthirty-eight in Jamaica<,>\n between Mister\n\nBustamente who headed    the union and Mister Norman\n\nManley who headed the nationalistic political party<,>\n And this was the pattern that you get right through the region\n the trade union\n\nleadership and the nationalistic leadership is identical<,> in some it is\n\nclosely allied as in Belize for a considerable period<,>\n\n And the reasons for it are entirely and uniquely a Jamaican\n\nphenomenon<,>\n Uh Mister Bustamente had a seat on the platform at the founding\n\nconference of the People's National Party<,>\n although he\n\nwas nominally a member of the metropolitan group of the People's\n\nNational Party he didn't take any part in its uh deliberations or affairs\n And he tended to be rather on guard and suspicious against the\n\npossibility<,> that his cousin Norman Manley might be a challenge to his\n\npopularity with the working class masses\n So he tended to discourage the membership of the Bustamente\n\nUnion<,> from<,> entering into the grass roots organization of the People's\n\nNational Party<,>\n interned\n\nwas imprisoned under war-time powers that the governor had imprisoned without\n\ntrial\n Norman Manley and the People's National\n\nParty assisted the<,>    officers of the B I\n\nT U to keep the organization going<,>\n the\n\nnationalistic message of the People's National Party<,> was being heard<,> by\n\nthe workers<,> on a closely co-operative basis<,>\n\n he broke the\n\nalliance<,> and from that time onward there was friction between the two\n\norganizations<,>\n\n\npolitical representation political uh  representational\n\npolitics<,>\n that there\n\nwas to be a new constitution<,> with an elected legislature elected on adult\n\nsuffrage Mister Bustamente formed the Jamaica Labour Party to contest the\n\nforty-four elections<,>\n And he had this problem that by that time the People's National\n\nParty had become known<,> as the champion of this nationalistic cause this\n\ncall for self-government<,>\n he devised a way of deflating the appeal of this\n\nnationalistic argument<,>\n in nineteen forty-four against self-government on\n\nthe simple argument self- government means brown-man rule<,>\n\n And so you have unlike any other part of the Caribbean area you\n\nhave a phenomenon where<,> a majority of the workers<,> in the early period\n\nin the nineteen forty-four elections<,> are hostile to the nationalistic\n\nmessage<,>\n and\n\nover the next period after Mister Bustamente overwhelmingly won the nineteen\n\nforty-four elections<,> over the next five-year period the workers and the\n\npopular masses begin to get a better understanding of what this\n\nself-government thing means<,>\n\n\nself-government is dropped<,> and you hear no more<,> about that<,>\n And of course as you know eventually Mister Bustamente led Jamaica\n\ninto political independence in nineteen sixty-two<,>\n is a uniquely Jamaican phenomenon which\n\ndidn't apply in the rest of the region where the working class was always\n\npart of the nationalistic movement\n going to be\n\nabout all we have time for\n with\n\nthe background stuff because of this unfortunate misunderstanding\n But not to worry\n uh and so I\n\nbetter stop there to allow time for the discussion<,>\n\n<$X> \n I have a question\n reasons you gave\n\nfor the masses  <,>  supporting the national\n\nsentiment then\n\n<$A>  the\n\nlegislatures were in a minority<,> which is explained in the background notes\n a franchise of only approximately\n\nten per cent of the adult population<,>\n with a legislature elected on\n\nadult suffrage<,> it was reasonable to assume that those elected\n\nrepresentatives being now more dependent for their votes on the uh masses of\n\nthe people would now have to show greater interest in them<,>\n the armed forces of the uh imperial\n\npower which were always rushed to the colonies in the war ships whenever\n\nthere was industrial unrest and in Jamaica there was a resident<,> regiment\n\nof the British army here uh at the time\n self-government\n\ncame<,> the armed forces of imperialism were not as readily available to the\n\nbig employers as they would be under colonialism\n So those are the two reasons why I say it was in the interests of\n\nthe working class and the small farmer to support the nationalistic cause<,>\n\n<$Y>  Uhm you have said that<,> from very early on<,> the advantaged\n\npeople uhm paid the movement and took the popular <unclear>\n\nword(s)</unclear><,>\n there has always been a\n\nreliance especially in Jamaica<,> you know<,> when <unclear> words</unclear>\n\ncalls yes he would rise and the P N P is in power of the ordinary advice<,>\n\nyou know\n\n<$A>  Well I think you are moving rather further forward than what\n\nI was dealing with\n the relationship was very\n\nco-operative between Mister Bustamente personally and Mister Manley and uh\n\nalthough Mister Bustamente kept the membership of the organisation out of the\n\nP N P membership structure during his internment that relationship became\n\nvery close<,>\n of the\n\npopularity of a potential rival<,> he broke the alliance when he came out of\n\nthe internment\n So from that time on the two organisations were at loggerheads and\n\nwith the formation of the Jamaica Labour Party you now have two political\n\norganisations fighting each other for the support of the electorate\n Now what you say uh about the Bustamente Union and the other union\n\n   the National Workers Union uh\n\nco-operating<,> is a more recent phenomenon\n developments in the Labour\n\nmovement<,> which<,> although it starts off<,> as a sort of arm<,> of the\n\ncorresponding political organisation<,> develops in the  <- >   course of time into institutions in their own right\n a particular union\n\nmay have representational rights but not<,> the political support<,> of the\n\nmembership for its<,> corresponding political arm\n And therefore during that period you do get these periods of\n\nco-operation\n\n\nwhich in nineteen fifty-one<,> developed into joint<,> representation<,> of\n\nthe workers<,> between  <,>  what was then the P N\n\nP's trade union arm the Trade Union Congress and the B I T U\n So you are perfectly right but what you are talking of develops at\n\na later period<,>\n\n<$X> \n\n\nuhm nationalistic movement\n\n\nword(s)</unclear> your expulsion from the People's National Party\n\n<$A>  break\n deal with this\n\nuhm pretty fully in here\n a part in history of those\n\nformative years nineteen thirty-six to the end of nineteen thirty-nine\n\n<$X> \n\n\n<$A> Is it\n\n of the\n\nnational movement\n when I gave you\n\nthis background sources<,> of nationalistic ideas that is the different\n\nsocial strata<,> which had an interest in<,> the promotion of nationalistic\n\nideas<,> uh I should have mentioned at that point<,> that the People's\n\nNational Party was an organisational representation of just that coalition of\n\ninterests\n with uh in simple terms\n\nwhich the media    adopted a left wing a right\n\nwing and a centre<,>\n of\n\nthe party<,>\n principal leader of that wing\n\nof the People's National Party was Mister Ken Hill<,>\n was represented by manufacturing people and\n\npropertied people\n best examples I can think\n\nof are Mister William Seivwright who was president of the Master Bakers\n\nAssociation<,> uh and Mister Rudolph Burke who was a planter in St Thomas<,>\n\n\nthis sort of alliance<,> and how it worked\n a minimum wage law was\n\nintroduced<,>\n And that law permitted the governor in an industry where the wages\n\nwere particularly depressed<,> to appoint a tribunal<,> to recommend a\n\nminimum wage for that industry<,>\n the governor appointed a minimum\n\nwage tribunal for the bakery and catering trades<,>\n of the employers because the\n\nconstitution had to be one  representative<,> one  representative and a government chairman<,> the  representative<,> was Mister Seivwright<,>\n\n And at that time Mister Ken Hill was the P N P's mayor for\n\nKingston and Mister Seivwright was the P N P's deputy mayor<,>\n So you have a sort of class struggle going on over the level of\n\nwages for the bakery and catering trade<,> and yet both men are

my ears    tended to grow with Jamaican\n\nmusic right with    the modern Jamaican music\n So that even if we make uhm a couple of errors somewhere along the\n\nline it should still be of worth to younger listeners and uh the older\n\npersons where we can flash out these things right<,>\n\n\ngive some kind of introductory<,,> statement right which would probably take\n\nfifteen or so minutes and then going to the music because<,,> one of the\n\ntimes when I was speaking to    a campus audience and\n\nI prepared myself very well with the paper and so on and at  \n\n end of it somebody like uhm professor Bradwith said\n Well I\'d have liked if you had taken the other slant\n\nbecause<,> we hear words every day and would like to hear<,> the examples of\n\nwhat you are speaking about\n So I am going to split it half and half in other words pay some\n\nattention to the academic requirements and also play some music which uhm<,>\n\nto give examples of what I am going to speak about\n and the\n\nrest of the Caribbean was seen as backwaters cultural backwaters right\n\nsocieties that were so dominated by the economic arrangements and populated\n\nby such<,> a diverse set of peoples thrown suddenly together and held\n\ntogether by force that it was felt that little in the way of indigenous\n\ncultural traditions uhm<,> could develop<,>\n were uhm fragmented or corrupted\n\nversions of transplanted European forms and unconnected bits and pieces of\n\nAfrican traditions<,>\n and this is now\n\nbeing uhm more generally accepted right\n The note of the irony though is that even while the euro-centric\n\nview<,> held sway<,> till fairly recently too not so long ago<,>\n\n\na a  a mere regurgitator    of\n\nEuropean styles has become a major a consistent major exporter of culture\n\nespecially in the area of music\n The most recent music form as I suspect all of us know to gain\n\nworldwide appeal has been Jamaican reggae\n Okay\n has so far\n\nhad the widest and most significant appeal\n That\'s one of the bones of contention because I suppose maybe some\n\nof the Trinidadians among us may say\n Well watch what you are saying my boy because we have had\n\nsomething from the<,> nineteenth century<,> well documented<,> probably the\n\nfirst to penetrate North America and so on\n tended not\n\nto be taken all that seriously\n I don\'t like to say that about music but I hope you understand what\n\nI am saying<,>\n On the surface this popularity this widespread appeal of Jamaican\n\nmusic would be surprising especially when one remembers that the early\n\nforeign commentators on this music particularly    in\n\nits early phases like the ska time<,>\n They have been so much similar to the older euro-centric observers\n\ndeemed it the inept failure to imitate U S R n B<,> right\n to our thing would\n\npoint one to the fact that as with other popular musics many combinations and\n\npermutations are possible\n a\n\nhybrid which has selectively creatively assimilated ideas from outside but\n\nwhich has continuity with homegrown traditional forms\n The whole process resulting in a qualitatively novel phenomenon\n Right\n The appeal of reggae as it has evolved has to do with its unique\n\nJamaican-ness and its critical incorporation of elements generated externally\n really come to\n\ngrips    with reggae this thing that has held the\n\nworld\'s ear for now is going over some twenty years some comprehension of its\n\nevolution is necessary\n\n\nsome detail then a better understanding is gained of why it has been able to\n\nuhm<,> appeal to this wider audience\n without roots there are no\n\nbranches and it is with the roots and the early growths that I am\n\nprimarily concerned today<,,>\n\n\nmo  modern period in Jamaica\'s music from the middle to the\n\nlate fifties<,> right\n But in order to set the stage for this analysis one has to spend a\n\nlittle time not much time going even further back\n the slavery period and the\n\ncolonial one\n spend too much time on\n\nthat just to<,> establish that<,,> despite the attempts of  <,,>  the dominant group and the colonizers to that\n\nhorrible word deculturate or deracinate and so on the Black masses of Jamaica\n\nthere was always a vibrant uhm<,> effort<,> to cope with the environment\n\nwhich the people found themselves in and out of this there arose many\n\ncultural forms\n and it is interesting that\n\neven from say day one<,> the slaves would be encouraged to make their own\n\nmusic right even from on board the ship where they would have to exercise and\n\none of the ways to exercise would be to create music\n more\n\nintrepid would even have been able to carry their own instruments<,> as well\n\nas learn from<,> their shipboard uhm oppressors and so be called upon to make\n\nmusic even while on board\n Landed they would make do with what they had\n They carried cultural equipment with them from Africa and were very\n\nquick<,> to grasp<,> the music of    the slave\n\nowners so that very early in the literature you hear of slave musicians\n\nproviding music for not only their own purposes but also for the slave\n\nmasters\n the odd\n\ntravelling group which would play the uhm European popular music of the time\n instruments songs\n\nand styles from Europe\n even today\n\nexcept when you\'re<,> probably listening to<,> elite or uhm<,> high classical\n\nmusic you\'ll find that<,> when the Black populations in the Americas\n\ngenerally in Jamaica particularly<,> you will find that any music played is\n\nstill coloured by<,,> the African heritage which people brought with them uh\n During the slavery period you can identify work uh digging songs\n\nreligious songs recreational songs folk songs ring games and so on\n twentieth century\n\ncertainly the beginning of the twentieth century nearly every parish and\n\nregion in Jamaica had some type of indigenous music\n This is still quite amazing to me\n Some of these types can be found today with a little work\n Almost every parish you go in Jamaica has its own traditional thing\n\nnow granted the modern pop thing has nearly surplanted this and so forth\n\n\nwouldn\'t want necessarily to enumerate them all now but uh if you think of\n\neast you\'re going to think of the maroons and Kumina\n more westerly up to up north that means even with\n\nSaint Mary and Saint Ann you\'re going to talk about uhm Dingki- Mini and uhm\n\nBruckins if you go to Trelawny you\'re going to see Convince and uhm<,> Brag\n If you go to MoBay and Hanover somewhere near there still you\'ll\n\nsee an Etu uhm Hanover Westmoreland and you\'re getting Etunago\n Come back round to Saint Elizabeth you probably find Gumbay and uh\n\nremnants of the maroons where in Manchester you\'re going to get the digging\n\nsongsClarendon and Saint Catherine you\'re going to see something like Buru\n\nand so forth right\n Almost every parish you go you can find this traditional thing\n represents the\n\nbedrock the bulwark the foundation on which   \n\nsubsequent musical creativities are going to be based<,,> uh<,,>\n\n\nyou can  which we can point to probably the most important\n\nright<,> would have to do with the percussive approach to music making right\n\nand the centrality of drums and other percussive instruments right<,>\n and\n\ncertain singing techniques<,> right the<,,> uh female tending towards the\n\ncontralto in many cases the male tenor tending towards the falsetto uh\n and of course most people\n\nare acquainted with the song format which we call " call and\n\nresponse"<,,>\n combined in\n\nvarious ways<,> in the various styles available to the various parishes\n turn of the century I\n\nthink we can speak of Mento\n the earlier\n\nliterature makes no mention    of this form right and\n\nthe etymology of the thing<,> speaks of a Spanish a possible Spanish    derivation and so on and no one is quite certain\n\nabout that but most of the older musicians who you speak to those village\n\nband musicians say that<,> folk song and Mento were known to them or their\n\nfathers or their grandfathers by the twentieth century\n first national popular\n\nmusic which means that it transcended the parishes right and it took elements\n\nfrom the various traditional forms and combined them with<,> some degree of\n\nEuropean instrumentation right to come up with something fairly novel\n the Trinidadians are going\n\nto say that boy Mento is not really anything different as Calypso<,>    or why else would many of your same musicians from the\n\nearly period speak of this thing they were playing as Calypso\n the battle of that\n\nis that because of    the way whole international\n\ncompanies operate that is they seize on what seems to be the going thing at\n\nthe time and at the time early twentieth century we talking about people like\n\nuhm<,> Atilan uhm Beginan Excecuter and these people\n It was Calypso that was kind of thing so all island music was seen\n\nas Calypso<\n#>So our boys now with a form very close to Calypso just decided to say\n\n well since that is a thing that is going on we are going to call\n\nMento Calypso\n\n\nyou can get forms that are virtually indistinguishable that is you\n\ncan get examples of Mento that are virtually Calypso\n But you will get other examples where you can detect a difference\n in\n\nthe  in the production of the rhythm\n\n\nyou  rare is it that you find    a\n\nbanjo<,> and a rumba box in Calypso and yet they were central to Mento uh the\n\ninstruments like your quattro and your guitar a conventional bass figure\n\ngreatly in Trinidad calypso whereas they didn\'t in Mento\n lyrical\n\ncontent', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL',

still carry on from your\n\nsnowball your bag and for years and your crinoline and all that,\n\n\nnot sure if it was    a conscious or a spiritual\n\nreawakening but I think it was more a spiritual because we weren't uhm\n\nsophisticated enough to be that conscious of what we're doing but, because\n\nof, we being the cutting edge culture in the world, maintaining \n\n  the gere and the kumuna and the dingki-mini and the\n\nJonkonnu and the Myal and the Obeah then we now became that forceful,\n\nforce    out of Africa\n Because remember there was two renaissance there was two trek\n The trek coming from Africa and the trek of us going to Europe\n\ncolonising back Europe\n Because when our people left from Jamaica during the bauxite\n\nescapade and hurricane in fifty-one when the wind rush and took all our \n\nbrains and before that the banana boats\n We actually went on recolonise Europe with our culture and our food\n\nand all of that\n Going to England changing the whole concept of living and lifestyle\n\nand that time sugar now become a prominent source of energy so the work days\n\nbecome longer and all of that and people start living more\n So we actually did coming out of Africa being colonised and going\n\nback to colonise Europe\n there was this there there\n\nthere'sthere's a fusion that was necessary now via some sound\n\n\na real identity<,,>\n left\n\nthere when she was twelve and went and did that whole uhm  My Boy\n\nLollipop and  Oh William\n She was a St. Clarendon girl in Clarendon in a primary school\n\nleaving Jamaica at twelve to go really now shape the world\n Having a number one a little girl or at that then Owen Gray and\n\nthen the whole Jamaican experience started    to\n\nbuzz\n But the world buzz was not an American buzz\n The world buzz was out of England because in order to get your\n\nmusic in mainstream, wonderland then it was through England because most\n\nof our trek both from the R A F and then after World War Two the promise that\n\nwas made to us and all our nurses and our bus drivers and all  \n\n our  <- > great  great technicians went to\n\nEngland and end up dying of tuberculosis and all of that and the cold and all\n\nof that in the first part   uhm    we\n\nexperienced all of that<,,>\n start to glamorise this\n\nculture<,> and  Harder they come came out of the blue\n came out just during the time of\n\nDulcemina\n\n\n the person who was supposed to come back and write a Jamaican\n\npiece and that got diverted to,  Moti's wife   \n\nand then Perry Henzell<,> David Ogden and a guy called Dennis\n\nScott<,> and even Jones Brewster, being Jamaicans who went off on that\n\nwhat you'd call academic trek to England\n Got that whole British experience of radio and television and films\n\n\nin the   in the sixties Jamaica now    was really high getting independence and really moving\n\ninto a new direction having a sound    the the\n\nsound  scap\n\n\nyou'd call a wayward phenomenon to become a dominant force\n new trend\n\npattern that was up    in Jamaica that\n\nwas nothing anywhere else in the world\n Except for the steelband that was being developed in Trinidad there\n\nwas no new kind of influence culturally that was really being expressed in\n\n<,> the Western and the Americas\n Because in the American tradition their culture was more warlike\n\neven their musical sound    was code messages cos\n\nall their big bands    now was even sending code\n\nmass code relationship and music for war messages\n\n\nthe  the people    on a level where\n\nrace our class our religion became secondary that was coming out of Jamaica\n now, sprung up\n\n\nstreet in the general sense and, the more, overview of Jamaica and a\n\nmore, contemporary background relationship and that came out\n\n\ncome really did, was actually took what you'd call fresh\n\nfoot non- practitioners\n never been exposed\n\nto the camera or even go to the movies and put them as real life characters\n\nin film<,>\n of that\n\nbecause I didn't have any formal training as an actor<,> before that\n\n\nyou're you're you're  you're a coward but then you say let me\n\ntry\n uh\n\nmost of us that was in that development didn't really have any kind of film\n\nbackground\n And the time Jimmy Cliff was in England just did this some or again\n\nat the end of the line said and it was a  toss up of who we wanted to\n\nbe the star and then we had like  Arthur Nellis we had Roy Sherlee and\n\nJimmy Cliff\n But Jimmy Cliff came across as the most powerful in that he was\n\nlike, one that you could, tell a story to and he would come back with a\n\nsong to match that\n So he became that character Ivan\n Ivanhoe Martin was one of the, all- time Jamaican badman known\n\nas raggin\n And raggin was like a gangster a bank robber\n\n\nand all that\n You know so\n came because\n\nwe had to find now a vehicle to travel on\n way in which uhm\n\nthe writers and the, person who developed the ideas and the characters saw\n\nit fit and hence  The harder they come\n Now we got to that crossroad and the film was there now\n Now how we're gonna make this work,\n And the way that we, envisaged and thought in our minds to make\n\nthis work it was to have the baddest soundtrack the wickedest set of Jamaican\n\nmusic,\n\n\nthe  there's the    Farward and  Pajaka the\n\nToots you know and the Jimmy Cliff men they were <unclear> word</unclear>\n\nsitting in Limbo\n and all those music now, just\n\nbecame, the soundtrack\n And what happened now is that, we had a two-dimensional vehicle\n\ntravelling with because the film was travelling on the back of the soundtrack\n\nand the soundtrack was travelling on the back of the film\n Because the soundtrack was so powerful that, if we had taken a\n\nline to say we're gonna promote the soundtrack it would be just as powerful\n\nas the colour and the speed and the drama\n it\n\nhad that what you'd call that speed    and that\n\ncolour that really Jamaica is noted for world- wide,\n And that's how we got to that stage\n And there was a big slump in the industry where you find that other\n\nfilms came along like the  Contra man and the<,> uh<,> \n\nNo Place like Home, and uhm  Marijuana Affair,\n\n The Clash and what have you\n But because film making is like big money, you're talking about\n\nmillions of dollars right\n have sixty million dollars\n\n   you're nervous to start because you're\n\ngonna blow that in five weeks and might end up in the rain\n\n\nanthropinories coming out of that old slave mentality whether you're\n\nblack or white    that old slaves trap still\n\ncatches you\n So we want the world to see our investments visual hence we got\n\ninto plazas and banks and insurance companies and all of that and concrete\n\n<,> and cos as a    filmmaker I couldn't go\n\nto a guy and say with two pages of paper and say, I want forty million\n\ndollars and a set in a plaza and hence now our economic tragedy\n Because uhm we didn't see ourself as an emerging nation we saw\n\nourself    as being there<,>\n You know and because of most of our influence came out of North\n\nAmerica because    the whole trend now changed from\n\nEurope to North America because with farm working and a lot of    the people now going to America    instead of England the whole focus change,\n And our biggest mistake in economic terms for just talking sake\n\nwhen we switch our dollar so fast from the pound to the dollar\n Because we weren't really ready yet for that all Jamaican I mean\n\nthat American first world kind of   \n\naggressiveness<,>\n\n\nof pinch now\n, to get\n\nback on track, we did all of those films and there were what\n\nyou'd call<,,> coverd the break even lot of people lost their money because\n\nuhm they weren't well thought out\n right technicians\n\nwhether black or white Jamaicans or what\n must have the\n\nbest practitioners to give it the best job no matter where you're from,\n And so it went into a slump\n And Jamaica became again just a location piece where, great\n\ncommercials will be shot here great parts of movies like  The Mighty\n\nQuinn  Club Paradise and all of those\n\n\n\na device to work with small cash like fifty million Jamaican dollars\n\nwhich is probably a million and a half U S or, a million  \n\n or twenty-five million U S or thirty million U S or twenty-five\n\nmillion U S to try and cope with now<,>    a form\n\nthat we could make regular Jamaican films and still not burden ourselves

{'text': "<$A> \n This topic is very interesting to me and it is also very wide in its\n\nscope\n I therefore want to try to focus my own thoughts and hopefully help\n\nto guide us    in some ways of thinking,\n man the\n\nlanguage itself is a problem as I think we all know that Gelani scholar that\n\nhe is had to explain that man never meant, the exclusion of women but uhm\n\nhuman\n\n\n of the world and the history of English in particular uhm uh \n\n  the language itself has co-operated in a process that\n\nhas masked identities have false emerged realities and have caused no ends of\n\nproblems that in turn led to, further oppressions of peoples, men and\n\nwomen included\n And so I think one of the things that has to come out of a thesis\n\nlike this is how do we deal with a language in terms   \n\nof describing human beings\n\n\nlanguage uhm game that has its own history of problems\n Sex in the minds of most people mean intercourse\n But in the minds of others it means uhm the expression of humanity\n\nthrough the body<,>\n\n\nthat\n But again because the issue of sex has been so linked with the\n\nissue of, uhm uncleanness and impurity people have major problems with\n\ntalking about sex and dealing with it\n my\n\nmy  my discussion properly well let me deal with liberty and\n\nthen come back to deal with it\n a word that comes\n\nparticularly out of the Rastafarian ethos as I understand it    which speaks about the life principle, uhm and the\n\nfact that all of us are animated by this life principle\n Now, religious people of various sorts, use different words\n\nto describe that life principle\n\n\n the familiar ones in    the history of\n\nWestern Christianity\n But there could be other ways of describing that\n not just the one who made\n\nthe principle but    the principle itself\n\nof living and the expression of living in a fulsome and wholesome and a\n\nholistic kind of way\n So that's how I understand it\n we have\n\nto tackle and I want not to just be general because other people are\n\nhere    to talk about other things what to be\n\nspecific in terms    of how it affects something like\n\nChristianity<,,>\n\n\nChristianity has contributed much to the world that is both good and bad<,>\n And in this region of the world, as my, competitor Marlowe\n\nwill tell you <,,>    we\n\nhave    a whole plethora   \n\nof legacies    from Christianity\n\n\nof what man    is an issue\n\n\nis fairly well-known of the fact that, in the beginning, there\n\nwas one creature\n Now the King James version of the Bible and other versions like\n\nthat made that one creature out to seem to be a male,\n But there are people who read it differently and people including\n\npeople with greater knowledge of the Hebrew, who indicate that that really\n\nwas more an androgyne or a hermaphrodite in other words it was a,\n\nmale-female being, that was eventually differentiated to be, male and\n\nfemale\n\n\nlet us make man it was more let us make human, which speaks about that\n\nmale-female principle\n And if that is so then the God in whose image according to that\n\nstory that man was made is also male-female<,,>\n that\n\nthat  that    is critical to\n\nunderstand in    this bit\n then it means that there\n\nis an emphasis there that    is layn at in one way\n It is also true to say that those scriptures also calls God mother\n\nand therefore preserves the female principle\n But also, that the holy spirit, uhm is seen as female in many\n\ncircles\n So by the time you reach most of the New Testament the language has\n\nbecome neuter in other words its spirit has been neutered defemininized and\n\ndemasculized to be it<,>\n So we're into a whole deeper language thing\n But I want to bring that to say that what is man is not, as\n\nclear-cut    as it seems to be so human is a good\n\nway to go<,>\n Now what does this mean for the male of the species\n It means that the male of a species cannot see himself as,\n\nsuperior to or inferior to the female and the other way around that the\n\nfemale ought not to see herself as inferior to or uhm, superior to uh the\n\nmale\n And one has to say this in a sensitive kind of way given the fact\n\nthat for so long women have been held down and the argument could almost\n\nsound as if ok now that women are not only asserting themselves but asserting\n\nthemselves as equal, the men are suddenly finding their egalitarian\n\nconscience and in attempt to patronise saying ok let's see ourselves equal\n\nbut really is trying to slow down the pace of, equalisation\n It could be read that way and that would be a person's right to\n\nread it that way but I think, what the whole movement   \n\nof feminism and womanism, have helped, us to do is to re-look\n\nat assumptions and see that the various scriptures that were being used were\n\nin fact not being used in the best way\n\n\nthat have been used co-operated in a process of oppression but that\n\nwe have to go further than those translations to try to go as close as\n\npossible to what was likely to be the original meaning of the text<,>\n\n in\n\nits widest way\n Again Christianity has been really uh using various ways\n Hebrew culture in out of which\n\nChristianity had part of its root and I say part because Christianity's root\n\nis Hebrew Greek Egyptian    and very deeply African\n\nin a way that most people don't realise and<,> which has been also shown away\n\nby Western Christianity that highlighted a Greek part of it uhm at the\n\nexpense and the Hebrew part at the expense of everything else<,>\n\n\n  the Hebrew sex    were uh background and the Egyptian background saw\n\nsexuality as something that was very very good and that should be\n\nexpressed<,>\n But by the time you reach the fourth century after Jesus where\n\npeople like Augustine steps in the apple that,   \n\nthe fruit that, Adam was alleged to have been given by Eve turns\n\nout to be sex\n And therefore the idea is this because Eve gave Adam sex why we\n\nfell\n Thus the reading that Augustine gives to it\n And from that day still is everybody has been either in that\n\nsex-less who aspires after holiness including Jesus so from neck down Jesus\n\nhas no genitals nothing he's sexless or, sex is a concession by way of\n\nweakness and therefore    the holier you get the more\n\nyou stop doing with women or with men so priests and nuns these holy people\n\nthey can't have anything to do with sex<,,>\n Right\n holy you\n\nknow but who have aspirations by way of weakness and concession\n\nto their own weakness we allow them to have sex\n That kind of split level thinking is dying ever so slowly but it's\n\nstill there<,>\n\n\nto think about when you're looking at that history and the legacy<,>\n the matter of\n\nlife<,>\n I think that it's critical to understand that we are in many ways\n\nthe co-creators of life<,>\n\n help to bring life into the\n\nworld in a number of ways\n that is a real\n\nprivilege\n However if there are distorted views of sex and distorted views of\n\nwhat it means to be human<,> male and female male or female we're going to\n\nhave some problems in understanding and expressing liberty<,>\n For instance there are people who will say that people need to get\n\nmarried because<,> of sex\n So suppose somebody got pregnant marry you or else kind of thing\n because of that kind of\n\nmentality why people    are you know have run\n\ninto all kinds    of situations\n I think we have to see that sex is something that can be enjoyed\n\nfor its own sake, but then it ought to be also contributing to the process\n\nof life whether a new one comes into the world or the people enjoying it are\n\nbetter able to live\n Where sex is used to help people to die to oppress people in any\n\nkind of way, it is a wrong use of sex for it's not contributing to liberty\n I think it's in that kind of debate that people would have to look\n\nat the various forms of sexual practices<,>\n The family forms with uh the so-called common law or uh visiting\n\nrelations\n think we have to look at it in that\n\nkind of context to make sense of it<,>\n And the matter of liberty is far more than and this is my final\n\npoint on this\n sexuality and it's far more than human beings\n\nfor liberty embraces all of life\n Yesterday I had the privilege along with some people here to be in\n\nHope Gardens\n\n\nthe the the  the flowers and  <- > the  the\n\ntrees and hearing the birds did something to me\n It gave me liberty it renewed my spirit\n Because I have to use the King James it restored my soul right\n really what it means\n It brought gave back my life to me\n Cos I came very tired and just fairly stressed in the morning and\n\njust sitting there and listening and just drinking it gave me back my life\n we have\n\nto  we have to look at beyond our love just our human activity\n\nthat we are nature we are not just watchers of nature\n We are nature itself\n We were born and one day we will die\n from dust we came is a myth and to dust we shall\n\nreturn\n and earth is part of us\n And when we know that then we'll have a greater respect for liberty\n So in conclusion, I've tried to delineate what I feel are some\n\nof    the major areas\n I've said that language is an issue when we're talking about man\n\nsex liberty we have to understand we're using terms that are specialised that\n\nwe shouldn't think they're universally understood accepted or appreciated and\n\nwe need language that would be transparent and inclusive if we're gonna make\n\nsense of these are separate issues but also of their connectivities\n I've also said secondly that we have to understand that\n\nChristianity itself with its legacy is an ambiguous legacy", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1d15ea95-c037-4efc-927c-cf2bc555c8be', 'added':

the problems that reggae has right now can be solved\n\nwith just<,> a few reggae singers<,> young singers who can take the thing<,>\n I've chosen to speak about reggae singing because I think there is\n\nsuch a thing called reggae singing as opposed to<,> singing as opposed to\n\njazz singing as opposed to R n B singing\n\nif  if    Carlyn and I have\n\nsimilar backgrounds\n\n\nparents uhm mothers are teachers and stuff\n Her brother and meself went to K C started off K C together and we\n\nso<,> uhm\n uhm made us how we're\n\n   bringing the question of Jamaican\n\nspeaking and talking and Patois and accent to the forefront\n\n\ndisc-jockeys have spoken this pseudo-American accent<,> called twanging\n It was a constant source of amusement to hear them announce some of\n\nthe records that they were putting on<,> uhm<,> strictly  rubadub uhm\n\n   it's all amusing to hear them mention\n\nplaces like  Gimmemebitanting\n And you could see it pained them whenever they had to use Patois\n And today some of them still hanging on to this twanging,\n influence\n was a place where\n\nthe person who sounded most American in reproducing a song was rewarded for\n\ndoing just that and many times real natural talent<,> was overlooked\n This had serious serious very very serious implications to Jamaican\n\n\nta  at a time we were taught not to be proud of<,>\n\nPatois<,> not to be proud of how we spoke,\n Uh myself and a group forty-four spent a number of years on the\n\nnorth coast performing cos that is one of the few places that\n people kept\n\nreferring to us  We love your accent,\n\n\nthe  the other  feedback that we were getting from\n\nthe<,> entertainment managers who still wanted us to sing  \n\n the American songs<,>    something got\n\nlost in the mix you know<,>\n in Patois it was not proper to sing in\n\na Jamaican accent\n it went\n\non and a lot of the great singers of our time, suffered\n the Tom Jones of\n\nReggae the  Lou Raws of Reggae uhm  the Smoky Robinson\n\nof Reggae and this was said as a compliment and people hearing\n\nthis<,> young people hearing this<,> aspired to be<,> to follow suit\n The group that I was associated with had The Temptations as our\n\nmentors\n And we practised the moves we practised the styles of singing we\n\npractised the diction we practised the accent,\n And we wondered why we were not getting to the people like other\n\npeople were\n And in spite of the fact that a number of popular singers I mean\n\nthe  Toots of they    were very very popular\n\nthey were not given the credit as great singers because they sang in Patois\n\n<,> they sang in a Jamaican accent,\n\n\nis the backbone of any genre of music and it is the singer who<,>\n\ninterprets<,> who represents who reminds us things that how we should feel\n\nabout things who prompts us into feeling things but we want to hear it in our\n\nown accent in our own  slang in our own terms\n We only have to look at the popularity of Hip Hop in America\n Hip Hop in America is popular because it speaks to the youngsters\n\nabout the youngsters the way the youngsters speak to each other as violently\n\nas the sound on record they sound even more violent in the streets speaking\n\nto each other\n They understand the language and they understand the lifestyle that\n\ngoes along with it\n since they're rapping you\n\ncould actually call it uhm rap singing then or rap    that is    the medium\n\nthrough which they communicate,\n So although we had a lot of very popular singers in Jamaica doing\n\nreally well I mean as <,> they did not

had\n\nfallen in love with reggae over the years and they were drawn to the Reggae\n\nBoys because they were the    underdogs\n\nand it didn't dawn on them they went on and did what they had to

{'text': "<$A>  it's coming from\n\na long way we could start from the Mento coming to the  swine but\n\nwe'll try to be as brief as possible\n Well the Mento era had it not much to do with that more than listen\n\nwhen we've been through that and uh we went to what we call a form of\n\nblues<,> the early beginning of the Ska music<,>\n American\n\nRock n Roll music so it was kinda bit bluesy but somewhere along the way the\n\nforeign ways that ah taking out that blues and leaving just the  step\n\noutof it\n\n\namong others who are not really mentioned in the music but really contributed\n\nto the building that foundation which everyone has built on today<,,>\n Uh all that other uhm at the federal studio in the very early\n\nsixties\n Brendford\n\nRoad the Studio One where most of the things that we enjoy today took\n\nplace\n development of that Ska\n\nmusic that the world is enjoying today which we do have much of here today\n\nourselves<,>\n Brivet Nibbs Jacky McTool\n\nLyn Ted all who contributed to    the\n\ndevelopment of that music<,>\n The Ska era lasted not that long period maybe about four years the\n\nSkatalites itself lasted for about one year as an <unclear> word</unclear>\n\nunfortunate for us<,>\n But in the period that it lasted a vast wealth of musical\n\ninformation was<,> partly  varied you know<,> that   \n\nthe goals    of very large collection of that\n\nSka music\n They don't play these music in Jamaica too often maybe on Sundays\n\npeople like Bunny  Wilison would play some of it but if you seek our\n\nown you can't find it  <- > and  and see for yourself what\n\nwas happening then<,> you know<,>\n The musicians then were like a bit more advanced musically as they\n\nhad worked harder much harder than these kids today what happened that \n\n  the kids today they would stick around the\n\nstudio and don't really practise the instrument\n To be proficient that instrument you have to work maybe eight hours\n\nthe day or more\n It's hard work but something you enjoy in the long run you know\n of great collection of the music\n\nhe has most of that music if anyone need to get information that's where you\n\ncan get it from\n known the world over who\n\ndied a tragic death you know rest his soul and uh we miss him a lot\n music would have been\n\ndifferent than what we are enjoying today like that D J stuff    it's all right but I don't think it's going too far\n\nyou know as far as music is concerned\n I myself contributed some to that music as I was in the studio with\n\nthe rest of the Skatalites<,> trying to carve this thing out you know<,,>\n\n\nwhen that sort of music was being played you know and as it continued\n\nI think you would have enjoyed it a lot you know as  it was    a lively music something you could dance at it's not like\n\ndancehall today where you go and you stand up   \n\nand you know like a modeling show and watch\n In that time you had to dance the music demanded that you come on\n\nthe dance floor and make some moves you know uh\n The ladies would probably reach out for the fellows and the fellows\n\nfor the ladies vice versa you know and you'd howl on to each other and\n\n Hey make moves you know we don't do that\n\nany more<,>\n like I said it's unfortunate that we don't have\n\nthat Ska music here with us today and I don't know what could be done to<,>\n\nreinstate that type of music    I could only\n\nhope that somewhere along the way somebody could see it fit to try and ah\n\nestablish uh reestablish and say a group like the Skatalites so we could get\n\nsome more of that music<,>\n Well coming along the way the forms keep changing they change from\n\nthe Ska coming to what we call the Rock Steady<,>\n At the breaking up of the Skatalites a part of the Skatalites uh\n\nremained at the Studio One studios and uh slowed the music down a bit<,>\n got the uhm\n\nthe Rock Steady people like  Arthur Nellys The Kengos Johno Woods\n\namong others you know<,> uh    The Wailers Bob\n\nMarley and uh Bunny Wailer Peter Tosh\n\n\nRock Steady era which again never did last too long as uh   \n\nthe foreigners thought it was a bit too slow\n A group of us went to Britain and the people liked the music but\n\nthey didn't dance<,> and it should have been a dance party but they\n\ncomplained that it was a bit slow so on returning we decided to pick it up\n\n live<,> to the four beats about probably out of this drum symbols\n\nplaying a sixteenth to speed the thing up some<,> and<,> mixed a little of\n\nthat early Mento in the music and we came up with what we call the reggae<,>\n\nwhich has had international acclaim\n\n\nthere is hundreds of bands playing reggae while we in Jamaica still do enjoy\n\nour own stuff<,,>\n I don't think they take a liking too much to the D J stuff that D J\n\nthing is uhm<,> based around Jamaicans you know    it's a strict Jamaican thing you know<,>\n I don't have anything against it I like the rhythm\n\nmyself it's just out of matter that the music itself is like\n\nlimited you know but the rhythm is lovely<,>\n fires burning I\n\ndecided to do this album here with a mixture of all this music some reggae\n\nsome Rock Steady and some Ska<,>\n\n And a C D which we call the Swinging Ska as the Swing music\n Swing\n\nmusic\n So we're fusing the Ska with the Swing to find ourselves in these\n\ntimes<,>\n\n\nthe idea of fusing  <- > the  the Swing with \n\n  the Ska is a new idea\n will\n\nend at the end but    we're looking forward quite a\n\nbit<,,>\n I don't know you as young people I don't know what contributions\n\nyou all can make uh it seems as if you all have a interest invested in the\n\narts music art in general<,> but uhm you could make demands or suggestions or\n\nwhatever\n And uhm the people that produce these music might give a listening\n\near<,> and try to<,> bring the music back to where it ought to be you know\n\nbring it back to Jamaica that we can enjoy our music you know like the\n\nforeigners are enjoying our music we do enjoy much of ours here\n It don't seems as if we in Jamaica love ours we love theirs more\n\nthan ours and you know\n It seems they do us injustice as we never wind up with ours\n\n\n\n Yes the rhythms are strong we know that but on top of that rhythm\n\nwe need something else we need some melodies\n\n When last have you heard someone\n\nwhistling<,> you notice people don't whistle anymore he said \n\nYou know why they don't have a melody to whistle\n\n\n Yeah we have all sorts of lyrics and things but we don't have no\n\nmelodies we need to create more melodies yeah<,>\n And in doing so we'd be able to write a page in the book of musical\n\nhistory you know<,>\n in\n\nin  in Jamaica<,,>\n\n\nI'm here in Jamaica and    I'm\n\nworking on the music in the best way I can<,>\n won't make any promises but\n\nwhatever comes out of it I think it uh it would be a\n\nworthy  uhm contribution to the musical\n\ncause<,,>\n Music is not all about talking I'm not much of a great speech\n\nmaker\n you all can\n\nmake some kind of contribution as far as uhm demands demands that some good\n\nmusic is being produced in the country\n check the\n\ndancehall with me sometimes <,> you know\n So if you can uhm get the producers to step up a little bit that\n\nwould be going for all of us you know<,>\n

understanding   \n\nof dancehall in about nineteen ninety-five<,>\n ignorance\n\n   and misunderstanding\n would say that I shared the view of the\n\nminister uhm Omar uh    so uh firmly\n\nexpressed    in the occasion  \n\n that's being talked about here\n Uhm, because what Omar was saying was very strongly and clearly\n\nstill is in many quarters the received wisdom   \n\nabout dancehall\n\n\nto work on    a video   \n\non uhm Paul <unclear> name</unclear> which was made and uhm I was\n\nliving    in Spanish town I better    that attitude because it's not just dancehall that's\n\nbeen treated like that\n All new musics that come from the grassroots of black communities\n\nand maybe from the grassroots of other communities get dismissed uhm by\n\nofficial society and sometimes even unofficial society\n write a long\n\nlist of all the popular musics of the Americas that Africans are involved in\n\nand each and every one of them was despised at one time including reggae and\n\nincluding the <unclear> word</unclear> of why a Bob Marley uhm\n\n   who was once thought of precisely in those terms\n I think one august columnist once called him a Barbarian\n So you know we haven't always been worshipping uhm uh Bob Marley it\n\nwasn't always    the honourable    uhm Robert Nestor Marley\n\n\nall that's happening is that it's taking time for dancehall to be\n\ncalled upon by the academy and also for it to become either high art which\n\nblues for example has done or to become folk art which mento has done    and so those things aren't despised anymore  <- >\n\nthey're  they're part of    the\n\nreceived folk canon,\n\n\none thing we could say don't worry about them and then we could just\n\nenjoy dancehall\n another approach\n\nand slightly more complicated and that's the one I   \n\nwant to offer\n I mean I think that it's actually necessary to construct a flexible\n\nuhm chronology    of the music uhm taking it\n\nseriously and saying not just what is this music but how can we    periodise it\n\n\nthat  that  Netto was saying   \n\nto look    at    uh\n\nthe element of it    that's emphatically\n\nuhm based    on an African aesthetic uhm and\n\nalso to look at the political economy of it\n all of those would be elements in a\n\nproper study a proper understanding    of this\n\nthing\n The other thing that we would need to do is recognise that some\n\npeople uhm uh started a little while ago uhm approaching now approaching a\n\ndecade ago or a little bit more actually to study the music uhm against the\n\nacademic trend and against    the trend of the\n\nreceived wisdom\n\n\nis a man called uhm    Frances uhm\n\nBilby<,>\n Uhm both of those people uh that they were give us important\n\ninsight it seems to me    on this music which\n\nthey actually bothered to look at\n\n\nand    she did the   \n\nsensible thing of taking    the music\n\nthe lyrics as texts and constituting uhm    what\n\nshe called a database out of it very uhm serious scholarly stuff\n\nuhm a    database out of it and\n\nthen uhm listening to it and deciding that it fell into five distinct\n\ncategories which    she kind of itemised    and so on\n raises is\n\nwhether uhm uh what she said all of those years ago about those five\n\ncategories still holds    uhm for the music\n\nnow\n Uhm so uh that would be or those are the elements it seems to me\n\n   of a proper approach\n chronology I may\n\nnot have time    to do a great deal uhm \n\nthe flexible slightly overlapping chronology uhm I think that    it's devisable into a number of periods\n\n\nof of  of dancehall\n didn't invent it\n\nand Yellowman didn't invent it\n Something that uhm contains the elements that were mobilized in the\n\nearly nineteen eighties was already there\n And that something was in fact uhm the development of the D J-ing\n\nform in Jamaican music going back perhaps as early as   \n\nthe late nineteen fifties but certainly in the nineteen uhm sixties\n\nand so on and I will come through uhm uh look at that come back to look at\n\nthat\n a period in which we can talk\n\nabout dancehall unwrapping slackness\n So that first prehistory would have lasted up until nineteen eighty\n\nor eighty-one\n dancehall\n\nunwraps slackness which we must be clear was always present in large\n\nquantities    in the Jamaican popular but\n\ndancehall kind of unwrapped it laid it bare for all to see and    hear    who would listen and in\n\nthat period uhm slackness kind of came to dominate uhm rastaroots uhm uh \n\n  and culture\n\n\n  into two\n Uhm I would say that one runs from uhm nineteen eighty eighty-one\n\nthrough to nineteen eighty-five eighty-six uhm and that the elements of that\n\nfirst part    of that period are slackness becoming\n\ndominant if you like but also roots and culture music remains in place and it\n\nremained in place as a big feature including importantly in the work of the\n\npeople who are famous as slackness artists\n So that Yellowman is actually a marvellous very very clever and\n\nable performer but he's also quite    an incisive\n\nsocial critic and that element was    uhm\n\nalways present in his music and he always combined them\n\n\n uhm  recounting of Yellowman performing at uhm,\n\nsomewhere in town round the William Centre I believe and in the middle of his\n\nthing he said  what do you want slackness or culture and of\n\ncourse the audience says or implies culture and he  slackness of\n\ncourse and he gives them    and    the audience says slackness\n\nand he gives them slackness right    a whole lot of it\n\nand he could do either and both one after the other uhm  \n\n in that very able uhm uh performer<,>\n\n\npe  sub-period  <- > in  in after\n\nnineteen eighty uh starts if I say    in uhm\n\neighty-five eighty-six and is really to do with the fact that round about \n\n  that time uhm   \n\na more  <- >   technologised uhm\n\nbasis    of the music emerged\n But

{'text': "<$A> Good evening everybody<,>\n is just reality\n\n Uh well firstly I guess we'd have to ask ourself what we value music\n\non the whole for<,>\n\n Some people it's the musical composition itself the rhythms and so\n\nforth I mean that made them up\n And then there's the lyrics and what they mean to you\n You have different type of music contained within the whole\n\ndancehall<,> and then what is dancehall music really<,>\n Dancehall music, according to some people one time dancehall\n\nmusic was music that was just any music played within the dancehall right\n So you're dancing and whatever music it is whether it's a reggae or\n\nR and B or whatever\n Whatever the latest hit was that was dancehall music\n However what we have come to really associate and know now as\n\ndancehall music is<,,> computer generated rhythms right on which people sing\n\nD J you know that there are lyrics in a single repeated monotonous rhythm\n\nright,\n Even saying that it's still difficult to define exactly what is\n\ndancehall music\n Because for example when an artist like Sizzla is D Jing on a\n\npopular dancehall rhythm most people say it's a reggae music and that's\n\nfoundation reggae music and yet still if Shabba Ranks comes on the same\n\nrhythm and D J about a different subject matter they say that it is now\n\ndancehall music\n Right so I mean defining what exactly is dancehall music in and of\n\nitself is a pretty difficult task right\n But others define it as I said before mainly it consist of\n\nartists<,> on computer generated rhythms right\n placing a value on\n\nthis music<,,>\n\n One of my favourite artists is Sizzla and when I started a quote\n\nfrom one of Sizzlas songs called Freedom Cry where basically he asks the\n\nquestions what are black people made of\n And answers by saying African traditions I tell you that straight\n\noff right\n In terms of dancehall music I would say that it has to have a great\n\nvalue to us as a people because, positive and negative sides of it in\n\nterms of lyrics is mostly African traditions that are being carried through\n you might say what I mean by this\n Because for example some people make a difference between original\n\nreggae music and the message that it carries and will say well this\n\nis more than that what should be valued for example\n\nthe music of Bob Marley and the Wailers Burning Spear and so forth and say\n\nthat it is more of a value because of the message that it carries a message\n\nof positive uplifting and repatriation to Africa messages of reparation those\n\ntypes of things\n People consider them of value which they are but I'm saying,\n\nwithin the dancehall arena now there are still African traditions that are\n\ncarried across that mightn't be<,> politically correct<,> but they are\n\nAfrican traditions none the less<,>\n an example of what I'm talking about\n\n<,>\n Perhaps the most, acclaimed dancehall artist so far in terms of\n\nboth sales as well as international recognition is Shabba Ranks right<,>\n I don't think any other dancehall artist has achieved two Grammies\n\nI don't think that any of them has achieved the same amount in terms of sales\n\nper album<,>\n He's gone gold twice and had several number one singles right and\n\nyet still people look on Shabba Ranks music and say that<,> it's coarse \n\n  I've heard be saying that it's not real\n\nmusic and even seen the criticism in newspapers it's not the real\n\nmusic,\n Albums that were produced by the best producers or some of the best\n\nproducers in Jamaica at that point in time in terms of Sly and Robbie Steely\n\nand Clevie I mean and these guys when they're putting their rhythms together\n\nwhether it be live or computer generated they're not going out there to play\n\nI mean they're trying to make number one hits that the world can relate to\n\nwhich the world did to those songs\n And yet still people say that the songs are not of value\n, So I guess this must be coming somewhere from the message\n\nthat's being put across I mean and comes back to the thing again they will\n\nsay that Shabba is cruel and so forth in terms of the lyrics of what he was\n\nportraying<,>\n Now I would not necessarily disagree with this but I just ask the\n\nquestion again\n Because the lyrics are not politically correct does that mean that\n\nthe artist himself is not a good artist\n Because we have two different types of art or we have many\n\ndifferent types of art but you have art that is used to politicise the minds\n\nof people educate them about certain things and let's be honest you have\n\ncertain art that is just there for art's sake to be enjoyed\n I mean is out there\n And all of us come across some piece of art that we like like that\n\nyou don't know why you like it just look nice right,\n that's\n\nthe question I'm posing out there what do you think about\n\nbasically<,> appreciating the music not just for the message that is one\n\naspect yes and maybe it can be argued that that is the greater aspect the way\n\nit affects people and so forth but in terms of the music itself, there are\n\na great many examples of dancehall music computer generated rhythms and so\n\nforth that are excellent,\n\n Uh some of them are still computer generated rhythms and I was in\n\nthe studio recently with Steely and Clevie and they were saying that I think\n\nis uhm<,,> so just say Bob Marley song was a computer generated rhythm that's\n\none of their first experiences seeing Bob messing around with this thing and\n\nhim couldn't handle it and give it to the engineer and say  deal with\n\nthis rhythm for me just produce it right,\n\n\nter  in terms of music\n Now it can be argued that basically, yes some of it might be of\n\na high quality but the greater amount of it is rubbish musically speaking<,,>\n the truth is that Jamaica has them say the most studios per\n\nsquare mile in the world musical studios\n We have a phenomenal output of music within Jamaica\n In any country where you're going to be having people producing\n\nthat mass amount of anything you're going to have garbage that's why you have\n\ncream to rise to the top\n, I mean the garbage has to be there\n Unfortunately and maybe what we need to look into is in terms of\n\nthe music that is played on the radio or that the radio promotes we know that\n\nwe have an    at least one all reggae<,> station\n\nradio station that I mean basically they have to play reggae twenty-four\n\nseven throughout the week so they're going to play a lot of music that is\n\njust filler\n Maybe that needs to be regulated in terms of what is the quality of\n\nmusic that they are allowed to play maybe they need music editors at the\n\nradio stations and so forth who have a good understanding of the quality of\n\nmusic right\n But I mean you can't say that the music on the whole is garbage\n\nalright<,>\n Now coming even a bit more into the question of African traditions\n\nwithin<,> dancehall music and saying all that I've said so far I think it is\n\nstill important to realise the fact that,  <-> musics of<->  music\n\nof different rates and speed and so forth carries a different\n\nvibration with it\n It lead you towards different types of thinking different sorts of\n\nemotional states whatever\n So you find that slow violin rhythms whether somebody is singing\n\nabout love songs or emotions or whatever they might bring out a certain\n\nemotion in you just by the tone  at which it is played the speed at\n\nwhich it is played et cetera\n You find that within original reggae music like foundation one drop\n\nmusic it carries us slower within mind vibration\n Based on the Niyabinghi drumming of rastafarians\n Which is used to basically carry across a certain meditation of\n\nholiness prayer meditating on certain types of things right<,>\n Now, so basically if a man is on a Niyabinghi rhythm or a one\n\ndrop rhythm if he's on a one drop rhythm it kinda hard for you even if he's\n\nsaying something of a negative nature your physical being is more likely to\n\nrespond to that rhythm<,>\n You see what I mean\n You're not really going to respond as much to the message that he's\n\nsaying\n Whereas if somebody says something on a faster rhythm more\n\ninclining you to dance or jump up or whatever them could be saying something\n\n   positive or righteous on the rhythm but\n\nyour truth is that you're going to be thinking more about dancing more than\n\neven the lyrics at whatever point in time<,>\n Alright this music named dancehall music you see what I mean is\n\nbased mostly upon dancing\n You check out the whole of the artist basically\n Their first intention when these producers produce a rythm the\n\nfirst intention with exceptions right is to make you dance you know\n\n\nthat is the intention of the producers in the music\n I´m not saying the lyrics are not as startful or whatever but you\n\ntend to be concentrating more on moving yourself to these rhythms than what\n\nis being said<,>\n\n\nalright\n In addition to that now or rather in regards to that what you find\n\nis that I know for myself like<,> one thing that we used to argue about a lot\n\nwhen I was more like following upon because you know every youth them are\n\nfollow upon their D Js or them out them favourite artist or whatever you\n\nfollow upon it like it's your life\n And I know one thing we used to argue about a lot when we were\n\nreading  reggae magazines and things of that nature was that\n\nbasically, the magazines oftentimes would rate a song like they'd given it\n\nfour out of five stars or however many stars and you see them give a song\n\nfour stars\n And when you hear the song the song is really a garbage song the D\n\nJ can't D J him    he's not on the rhythm\n\nor right and in the rhythm properly\n The rhythm is not something that you would want to dance to it's\n\nnot something that you would listen at a club or at a dance or in your car\n\nbut however the song is a positive song right<,>\n So therefore him saying something good him praising the Almighty\n\ngood song right but if him say people dead bad song that song  \n\n is what I'm saying\n There needs to be definitely a recognition of the fact that I mean\n\nmusic is an art is about the level of just being appreciated for the message\n\nwhich it gives\n\n Now in regards to that and also what I was saying about the effect\n\nthat the speed of this music has on you you find that the truth is that\n\ndancehall is like modern day society in terms of the way that the society is\n\nmoving or the speed at which we move<,>\n

{'text': "<$A> \n I've never done this before so I have no idea of how it's going to\n\ngo on and where it's going to go\n Those of you who know me who are my friends I think will have heard\n\nbits and pieces of it already because essentially as far as I understood it\n\nit was to be a kind of personal testimony thing\n who are historians\n\nand expect to get history are not going to get that kind of history so\n\n\nI thought I hesitated a lot and then I thought a little about it and\n\nthought no I should\n thing was something that Erna\n\nBrodber said to me a long time ago<,>\n That the minority groups in Jamaica have to lay claim because if\n\nthey don't nobody is going to confer it on them\n I have to lay claim and this\n\nis a little of my laying claim\n\n\nmonth's time<,> I'm going to be fifty-five uh and I figure a little over\n\nhalf a century I've been living in this place\n to\n\ntry and clarify in my own mind what exactly it has meant to me to be born in\n\nJamaica to be brought up Jamaican and all the kinds of influences that have\n\ngone I think into making me what I am\n So I'm hoping to share some of this with you this evening it might\n\nbore the pants  off of you but such is life in the\n\ntropics\n Uhm and the whole question of identity of course you would think\n\nthat after fifty years you'd have your identity thing very clearly sorted out\n\nand settled but in fact the whole question of identity remains and always is\n\nespecially in the West Indies a very complicated and a very complex thing\n\nbecause of all the multitude of peoples that we have in the Caribbean and the\n\ndifferent strands and influences that uhm go into making up what we are\n as I see it I've\n\nbeen exposed to really two main strands of influence and I like to think of\n\nit as the Yin and Yang of my life if I will use a Chinese symbol\n\n\n  they have a kind of holistic relationship to\n\neach other and I can't separate them clearly or sharply as to which part is\n\nthe Chinese and which part is the Jamaican and where it blurs and becomes<,>\n\nyou know what is indistinguishable<,>\n\n\nI  I think of as the conservative impulse the impulse that\n\ncomes from my parents the Chinese part the looking back to the origins\n\nlooking back to the roots\n And in a sense it stems from my parents who came to Jamaica my\n\nfather in nineteen thirty and my mother ten years later in nineteen forty uhm\n\nso that I'm a first generation person\n It's not that I've been here for that long\n Uhm and they settled in a little rural town in the heart of Saint\n\nJames which is on the railway line called  Cattadupa some of you might\n\nhave heard of almost as bad as  Mocco but anyway    where we had a peculiar\n\n\nin a village where the Chinese shop which my father ran was also the\n\nhaberdashery was also the bakery and was in a sense the centre of that\n\nvillage in the sense that you know all and sundry came to that town came to\n\n   that spot    to buy\n\ngroceries et cetera et cetera et cetera uhm\n from my mother's\n\narrival in nineteen forty and then between forty-two and fifty-two in\n\nrapid succession they had six children uhm with the gaps in between for those\n\nwhich they lost but I think he tried every year to produce one uhm but six of\n\nus survived\n in a sense we were born to a\n\ncouple who were straight from China and who were settled in this rural isle\n\nso right away you have this dichotomy where uh the foreign parents are\n\nsettled in a very rural very Jamaican village<,>\n But in addition to that the two strands then start operating once\n\nwe were born because the other strand the second strand the other part of the\n\nYin and Yang thing I consider is what I call the Creole impulse uh<,> the\n\nnative impulse    the thing towards nativizing if\n\nyou want to call it that\n So I tend to see it in terms of these two strands\n Creole impulse of course in\n\na way    is a combination of both the\n\nreal Creole as well as the English colonial influence\n And I start with our birth when apparently our next door neighbours\n\na Jamaican couple called Neville and Ethel Duhailey insisted that my parents\n\nbaptized all of us Roman Catholics because they were Roman Catholics\n that right away we had departed as it\n\nwere from my  original religious beliefs which was a kind of\n\nConfusionism I guess what I can gather\n So we were baptized in Roman Catholics because Ethel and Neville\n\nwere Roman Catholics and my parents also gave them the job of naming us\n\nbecause they knew no English names\n always counted myself\n\nfortunate that I wasn't named something like Nehemiah  Obedial or\n\nsomething because Neville and Ethel had some reasonable decent choices\n So they chose names for all of us and they also acted as godparents\n\nfor all six children so\n to me is amazing is that I\n\nhave never seen these people ever again and that I don't know what ever\n\nhappened to them you know they were just thisThey were important in naming\n\nus and in making us Catholics but at the same time   \n\nthat they gave us    this names my parents\n\nalso gave us Chinese names uh<,>\n twin impulse I'm talking\n\nabout is there also from the beginning because officially to the world and on\n\nall my documents I'm Victor Lloyd Chang to my parents I was always Gim Fui\n\n\nsort of schizophrenic thing where I knew that I would respond to\n\nVictor outside but at home it was Agem or Gim Fui I was called\n the\n\nchoosing of the names uhm and the Chinese names were then sent back to our\n\nvillage in China to be recorded    in the family\n\nbooks and interestingly I gather to be carved on the family tomb\n a sort of uhm mausoleum\n\nin the village apparently    with  <,>  all of members of the Chang family with their names\n\ncarved in because the Chinese recognize that once you're born you have to\n\ndie\n So so very sensibly as soon as a child is born the name is thus\n\nadded to the list\n\n Uhm so that for years I heard about this tomb in China which my\n\nname was already on the all of\n\nit's sort of uh a kinda creepy feeling but you know  \n\n it again emphasizes that sort of double thing that    I've been talking about so\n\nthat  legally then    this sorts of\n\ndualism that existed that we were leading a kind of shadow existence    in China in  Guandong and leading  <- >\n\nan  an existence in the heart of  Cattadupa in the\n\nmiddle of Saint James<,>\n third I think most important factor\n\nin the shaping of my life and all our lives uhm<,> in terms of a Jamaican\n\nChinese context was the fact that my parents employed a black Jamaican woman\n\nto be our nanny if you want to call it that and her name was Belle uhm<,>\n I confess with shame that I have no idea what Belle's last name was\n I never knew it as a child and I suppose children are not curious\n\nabout things like that uh and uh\n ten years when I was ten years old\n\nshe did not come with us and    we never kept in touch\n\nso I somewhere in my history is this woman who played such an important role\n the\n\nthe the  the/}> power and the force that Belle had over us\n\nreminded me very much of the description by Edward Long about the early white\n\ncolonials in the West Indies    who were handed over\n\nto nurse maids to look after you know because that's what they had available\n\n\n while my parents stayed in the shop they handed us  over\n\ntotally to Belle\n in a sense I would say now more important to us\n\nthan my parents were\n\n\nshe  she fed us breakfast she dressed us and when it was time\n\ntook us to school uhm came up back at lunch time with our lunch in one of\n\nthose enamel carriers uhm picked us up in the afternoon to take us home\n\nsupervised our play and leisure time and then fed us bathed us fed us supper\n\nput us to bed told us the most terrifying Duppy stories and\n\nleft us quaking into the dark to go about her business you know\n every night for years this\n\nwoman kept doing all this for us so as far as I was concerned this she was\n\nthe most important person because I saw her ninety per cent of the time as\n\nopposed to my parents who were just these figures in the shop\n Except on Belle's one day off on Sunday my mother then desperately\n\ntried to reassert her Chinese roots\n So we were then fed you know uhm pork with black bean sauce and\n\nChinese roast chicken and rice et cetera et cetera\n she tried as it were to\n\ngive us\n\n\nI'm showing you that on one hand we had all this Jamaican and    then my mother desperately tried to haul back\n But they also tried to reassert their hold in another way and that\n\nwas that we had to talk to them in Chinese\n So if I respond to my father or mother they would talk to us in\n\nChinese or I should say properly in Hakka because that's the dialect that\n\nthey spoke\n one language it isn't\n\nit is a multiplicity of dialects\n So they would speak to us in Chinese we had to answer uhm and that\n\nwas another way of holding on to it okay and we observed Chinese New Year and\n\nhad fire crackers et cetera\n But apart from that the real substance of our lives was really with\n\nBelle and I mean unknown to our parents or they didn't suspect it the kind of\n\ninterweaving with    our lives with hers that took\n\nplace was on a scale unimaginable\n So that years afterwards they would complain bitterly that we were\n\nall so un-Chinese and    with\n\nsurprise you know whereas in fact they should not have been surprised because\n\nof this process that had been going on for so long\n\n\nthat Belle was filling our minds and our imagination with uhm \n\nDu stories about  Anancy and Duppy",

{'text': "<$A> Thank you sir for those kind words\n Sorry you brought up the nineteen eighty-three thing but you know it\n\nreally hit me it's twenty years ago uhm in nineteen eighty that I started in\n\nthe English department and\n was a long time ago\n\nboss\n ran into Carolyn\n\nCooper and she said Chantal come to this thing no man because you know you\n\nhave to come and share your experience and the rest of it\n And I love any excuse to get out of office because my phone ring\n\ntwenty-four what you say twenty-four sixty-seven<,,>\n\nthere you go morning noon and night\nI gone I gone for half the\n\nday<,>\n So Carolyn you told me this how many weeks ago I must get ready for\n\nthis thing\n So I start to reflect why did I pick English twenty years ago uhm or\n\ndid I forget I never pick English is English picked me\n come to English department I wanted to\n\nbecome a lawyer<,>\n And so I busted my little brains at A levels and applied and the\n\nEnglish department was secondary\n\n I know in sixth form at Holy Childhood if you had any ambition and\n\nyou had plenty because you were in sixth form so you had gone from the masses\n\nmany of whom barely graduated and had become a member of this elite thing\n\ncalled the sixth form\n Now if you had any little ambition you want to become a lawyer or a\n\ndoctor or a manager never really know much about the management part manager\n\nof what and how the business world operated\n\n You do your A levels and that is where you're really heading\n\ninto<,> unless your family had a business and you know your future is safe<,>\n\nyou're going through the little educations and then you're gone into the\n\nfamily business\n So here it is I have great ambitions of becoming a lawyer and my\n\nmother says  wonderful because you love to have the last word\n Anyway the grade's not so wonderful and English beckons and I\n\ndecide well<,> it not so wonderful but I know the subject material and it\n\nsure did look like a very pleasant way to pass year one until the faculty of\n\nlaw would take me<,>\n\n\nafter<,>  after sixth form and of course after year one in\n\nthose days you pick    your courses for year two\n\nbecause by this time now law and I divorce\n The grade's B is not bad but so many people wanting to get into law\n Girl your butt is stuck in English\n That's all right fine let me go on through with this degree and I\n\nthinking about what I gonna do with it after as yet\n fun time now\n\nyou pick the subjects based on the lecturers\n\n\nlaughterBanana bread for breakfast you know because we had Seacole\n\nHall and  cyaan wake up at eight o'clock in the morning\n\n\nget up in a pure cussingAnd we love Victor can you imagine after\n\nthe high school experience you meet a <unclear> word</unclear> like Victor\n\nChang cuss cuss cuss So we pick Victor\n\nbecause you have banana bread for breakfast and you enjoy de Patois and de\n\ncussing and de tracing\n Then there was a gentleman we called the Engle Dude what a\n\ngentleman<,>\n You never have to worry well in that one no no cussing guaranteed a\n\ngentleman to the core<,,>\n what we called The\n\nGentle Trio\n We had the Dude who was Professor Engle Dude\n Is he still here\n Okay he has left\n Well there was Professor Engle Dude very British and at the end of\n\nthe third year you'd go up to his house in the hills and have tea and\n\nsandwiches a wonderful privilege and the other gentlemen uh the Morris and\n\nthe  Baugh delightful gentlemen\n type\n\nthing where anybody would cuss you\n So it was a comfortable year year two\n but we had a\n\ncomfort level there about three of us from Holy Childhood ey who went through\n\nEnglish together\n And then you had the rebel Carolyn Cooper with this new afro\n\ncentric image and the values of the independent woman that sister never tell\n\nus about at Holy Childhood\n So what a fascinating experience that English course was\n I played\n\ndouble tenor in the steel band and you had to rehearse at least<,> four times\n\na week and life was just a ball and a bowl of cherries\n hit at the end of third year\n\nwhen family saying  what you're going to do with this degree\n And that is when it finally dawns on me I had a ball\n I enjoyed the subject but pretty much I suspect the same thing that\n\nprobably faces a lot of you you start to wonder what you gonna do with it and\n\nI remember my great great great grand aunt Aunt Jean out in Saint Thomas dead\n\nnow God rest her soul\n She was so upset and you know in a way she represented the values\n\nof many Jamaican families to date I suspect\n yu deh a university fi study story\n\nbook\n Weh yu a go do wi dat\n remember old\n\nold lady\n She died at ninety-eight or ninety-nine and her pride and joy was\n\nthis little one  pikney dat finally reach university and\n\n so help me God\n She gonna read story book what more story book what she going do\n\nwith this story book\n ball\n I talked to my mentor sister\n\nStephanie I said  what I do with this degree so she said\n\n come teach\n At least some of you know you want to enter the profession that's\n\nfine\n and in I\n\nwent for four years\n\n\nI ever so gradually started to recognize the value of reading English\n\nas it is said\n But I do wonder start I've gone through all of that because I\n\nwanted to know that I understand the ambivalence   \n\nthe feelings of doubt and what to do with this degree and I think you\n\ntoo must recognize what social pressures very often make you feel that you\n\nhave settled for second best\n Because very often there's so many aspirations and ambitions and\n\nyour family lives vicariously through you you know\n Those of them that didn't achieve what you have managed to achieve\n\nexpect you to help them to lift their heads a little higher and to say\n\n see this is what my daughter or me son or me grandson or me\n\ngranddaughter achieve and somehow the whole thing of an English\n\ndegree is not quite it<,,>\n Even with all of that when I'm told two three weeks ago come and\n\ntalk about English it really    I felt a little bit<,>\n\nstunted I couldn't figure out what to tell you\n I can tell you the usual things personnel managers because I've\n\nspoken with a few in the last week or so have told me  yeah man\n\nEnglish Majors good stuff don't worry that we're moving into the twenty-\n\nfirst century and technology and the rest of it\n They have a wonderful knack for writing reports fine communication\n\nskills and the rest of it\n all that there\n\nis  all that there is to it\n And having forced myself after twenty years since I entered this\n\nprestigious department just    to sit and try and put\n\na little more depth into it so I can give you something a little bit more\n\nsubstantial\n Would ask you to think of your course in the following way\n is more than\n\nthe average studying for a profession say let's use law and medicine which\n\nare the ones that    our adults like to use\n And you see when you go into law and medicine you are learning how\n\nto<,> how to practise the law how to fix the body how to do this you're\n\nlearning the theories you're learning procedures you're learning how to excel\n\nin a particular area of expertise\n But let me tell you you can enter into any of those areas\n\nmanagement law medicine any time you choose to\n If you check the law department there are probably people there who\n\nare starting law in their forties maybe even older\n So don't worry you're not missing out on anything\n The how to you can learn throughout life and you should you really\n\nshould expose yourself as often as possible throughout your life<,> to the\n\nvarious theories that guide uhm    every aspect\n\n   of life\n There are theories procedures rules ethics they're always as\n\ndynamic as the individuals and social circumstances that shape them\n Try to imagine today I'm in marketing\n If I try to run a business on the principle that you first create a\n\nproduct that you can produce and then go out and sell it to death my business\n\nwould collapse because marketing has long moved away from that\n That's an old principle an old precept\n So these fine professions that are law and medicine and management\n\nare all a system are all systems procedures theories that if you chose to go\n\ninto one of those then wonderful it's lucrative it's a fine lucrative career\n But back to what it is that English can give you\n You see I realized in the last week or so that while law and\n\nmedicine and social sciences prepared my friends for careers<,> English\n\nlaboured to prepare me for life\n And I want you to appreciate that it is as basic my final analysis\n\nit is as basic as that\n English gave me a front seat to the theatre of life it gave me a\n\nsneak preview into what made people tick\n So while the medical students picked apart the body and tried to\n\nunderstand how this organ worked in  tangent with that we sat down in\n\nEnglish and picked apart the moral fabric of people's lives we looked at\n\ntheir passions at their ambitions what made them have reactions to certain\n\ncircumstances\n And I know you sit there at a university and wonder how the heck is\n\nthis going to help me to earn a buck<,>\n I'm gonna get there and I'm very comfortable earning quite a few\n\nmillions a year so trust me it's ain't nothing wrong with this English\n\nthing<,>\n I'm\n\nnot very good I'm sorry sir remembering the names of authors or poets\n\nbut I can remember the impact of certain pieces of work\n that uhm I think it's\n\ncalled  How To Eat A Poem and I remember enjoying\n This is going back even further now from my UWI days\n This was a first form English teacher nineteen seventy-three at\n\nHoly Childhood Mrs Hamilton I'll never forget the lady  How To Eat A\n\nPoem<,>\n And that's one of the two pieces of work of English works that have\n\nstuck with me\n way past mh forty years old now but\n\nit has stuck with me", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '987ad74d-722b-4923-8faa-316f0ebe2e0f',

{'text': "<$A>  Good afternoon everyone uhm, Doctor Cummins administrators\n\nof UWI campus Grace who is in charge as they told me uhm\n first I must\n\napologize for the late coming but uhm, I was to go\n\nand pick up a certain gentleman who you'll be hearing from a bit later on in\n\nthe program and the traffic wasn't very very pleasing and not being in\n\nJamaica as often as I'd like to I could not negotiate  \n\n what I used to call back roads you know\n The back road seems to be the main road now so\n\n Uhm I've been asked to speak more or less about myself and my\n\npersonal development which I'll attempt to do\n I was told that it was gonna be a nice little classroom of quiet\n\npeople    about ten to fifteen students and\n\nthose gonna be very informal<,>\n Only to come here and see a big audience and Grace assured me that\n\n   it's nothing stressful just easy going\n\nbut\n mentioned\n\nto Grace that I think the best way out is to try to get people involved as\n\nwell and  try to get the audience interactive so<,>\n a little bit\n\nabout my personal development how I achieved some of my goals you know what I\n\nhad to do and some of the things that     I\n\nwas to go through and then we'll probably open the floor for questions and\n\nanswers so that some of you might want to know about my batting how many\n\nrounds I have and stuff like that  \n\n we'll leave that for a bit later<,>\n Well uhm I started my cricket career at competitive cricket at\n\nthirteen uhm\n I solely started the game for the love of it just to play cricket\n\non weekends hang out with the guys something to do  \n\n outside of school<,>\n The secret behind it was I didn't play cricket at Melrose when I\n\nwas playing    at Melbourne nobody knew how to\n\nplay cricket there which was something similar to Excelsior when I got\n\nthere<,>\n I was spotted by accident by a form teacher who was walking on one\n\nevening and saw me by the park and says  what are you doing here why\n\ndo you play cricket at Melbourne you don't play for your school I\n\nsaid  well no one at the school has ever asked me<,>\n only to be told that there was a game the next day and I\n\nwent and participated\n And I sort of started playing for Melrose then and went on to\n\nExcelsior<,>\n going to\n\nschool<,> playing cricket and you know trying to have an education<,> all\n\nthat build up wasn't really it was a lot of work to do and there was a lot of\n\nquestions being asked at you know\n Are you gonna be able to play cricket are you gonna be able to do\n\nschool work and<,> I had a of a lot of people behind me I had a lot of\n\nsupport from teachers who    when the crunch\n\ntime came when I said well I wanna give cricket a break to further my\n\neducation    the one good thing\n\nthey said to me and it's something that is sticking to my mind that when you\n\ncan't go back to school you can't go back to cricket and hence the reason why\n\nyou know when I choose to go on play cricket I didn't have any second\n\nthoughts as to<,> what my future's gonna hold because  <- > there \n\nthere was always the assurance that once you finish your cricketing\n\ncareer you can go back to school no matter how old you are once you're\n\ndetermined to do it<,>\n I think you know without going around the corner I can say\n\nI'm a very determined person because I've set certain goals I've set certain\n\nstandards of things I want to achieve and ways and means about going out to\n\nachieve it\n And one of them was at an early age I said well I wanna play for\n\nthe West Indies<,>\n the way of doing that was to go to the channels\n\nof playing youth cricket for Jamaica playing for the national team try to\n\nmake our West Indies youth team and then try to play for   \n\nthe West Indies A team at the time to see if you could get selection\n\nfor the senior team<,>\n And I'm probably one of the few cricketers who went through all the\n\nstages played youth cricket for Jamaica in nineteen seventy-nine<,> played\n\nfor the senior team in eighty-one eighty-two<,> went to Zimbabwe in\n\neighty-three with the<,> A team and then made my debut for the senior team in\n\nnineteen eighty-four\n\n\n  as a career I saw it as a fun thing a pastime a sport\n\nthat I'm gonna play because I loved it and just gonna do it for the\n\nenjoyment<,>\n that\n\nwas when it start to drive home that you've got to make a choice here you\n\ngonna be playing cricket in England for six months you gonna be going on tour\n\nin the West Indies for three months that is nine months out of the year do\n\nyou    adapt or accept cricket\n\nas your full-time job and do whatever you can in the next three months or do\n\nyou<,> you know    give up cricket\n I came back home went to my headmaster at Excelsior Mister Wong and\n\nsaid uhm<,>  I know that you gave me permission to go and play cricket\n\nwhen I was at school but now I got a problem full time cricket is not gonna\n\nblend in with the education\n well it's similar to what we told you that\n\nwe'll you know reserve a space for you here at school so you can go on play\n\nyour cricket but still stand\n And it wasn't a very very easy decision but I said okay sir if I\n\ncan go on play    in England for one season or maybe\n\ntwo season just to try it out and then  \n\n I'll come back to school    and start my\n\neducation<,,>\n As you are all aware I still haven't been back to school as\n\nyet<,,>\n that\n\nis to tell you how long I've been on the road<,>\n On the road wasn't very easy\n Uhm you've we have got trying times you've got to set as I've said\n\nit earlier set certain standards and maintain it<,>\n thing I sort of set out for\n\nmyself was<,> if I didn't play for the West Indies then I would not have\n\nachieved or I would have wasted the time of<,> my headmaster fellow teachers\n\nand fellow students who had encouraged me all along the way\n So I was very determined to make sure even if it was only for one\n\ntour I was determined to make it at the top for the West Indies team\n And that meant getting up at four thirty in the morning by the\n\nMelbourne park<,>

look at<,> go down to Melrose do\n\nschool<,>    as I say in the early days I didn't play\n\ncricket at Melrose so I had to leave Melrose come back home try and finish my\n\nhomework in time to go to Melbourne so I could have cricket practice<,>\n Cricket practice didn't start at Melbourne till four thirty five\n\no'clock because all those who practised or most of who practiced were working\n\npeople so    they had to lots of stress sneak off\n\nfrom work as early as possible\n So we the kids would go there and play practise then and then you'd\n\ngo back home and whatever homework you didn't finish you'd tried to finish\n\noff and you know try on our own to seeing the guys that you ought to see how\n\nthey go about organizing their cricketing life or their day to day life and\n\nstuff like that\n dawned on me\n\nthat well it's not gonna be easy if you really wanna play for the West Indies\n\nso<,> you have a choice where you can either say no you're not gonna play\n\njust play senior cup cricket go back on to school and try to get a nine to\n\nfive job but the love I had for the game and you know wanting  \n\n to do well wanting to excel at the highest level<,> was like\n\nsecond to none\n was very very determined that well I'm\n\ngonna do whatever it takes to make this West Indies team and you know that\n\ncalled for a lot of sacrifices uhm<,>\n a early age you're either still when\n\nI move on to Excelsior practice at school still go home to homework practice\n\nat Melbourne well  <-> the the the</- >  the hardest one for me\n\nwas like the morning sessions because as everybody you know to get up out of\n\nbed    is not a very easy thing and to\n\nthis day it's you know it's one of the challenge for me because I still have\n\nto get up and go and jog at four in the morning or five in the morning to\n\nmake sure that<,> when you turn on your T Vs or your radios I'm out there\n\ntrying to perform at a level that you're all accepted or   \n\nit's become of me\n When you've set certain standard you have to try to maintain it and\n\n   it calls for very very hard and physical regime<,>\n\n And like when you're not playing cricket actually the cricket is\n\neasier because once the cricket gets started you get into a match condition\n\nyou can look after yourself you can pace yourself and you can more or less\n\nwork to what you want to achieve and you maintain a certain well what we call\n\nmatch fitness<,>\n We at a camp last week and I can tell you I felt like I was in the\n\narmy\n, We were up at five thirty every morning going to the national\n\nstadium for six for a hour and a half workout<,> and it wasn't easy\n\nespecially if you haven't done it for a while and because it was only a one\n\nweek camp they tried to fit everything in the week<,>\n And just to give you an example of what the days were like Monday\n\nfive thirty at the stadium up and down the steps did everything for an hour\n\nhour and a half\n Got back we had breakfast from quarter to nine till nine fifteen\n\nthe boss rowed again at nine thirty\n We went to Sabina Park start practice cricket practice at ten\n\no'clock\n Ten to one thirty break for lunch\n we uh our break would start like at two\n\nthirty\n Two thirty until four o'clock field and practice then physical\n\nfinish at four leave four fifteen got back to the hotel but all the traffic\n\non the road we didn't get back until say about five five thirty by the time\n\nwe got back\n We had a lecture at six we had a seminar at eight and at ten\n\no'clock the guys were sleeping and we're saying that you know    it's a long day but I mean these are some of the\n\nsacrifices you have to put through", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$A>  That's how I ask you to look at English\n Cut apart those works of English\n Learn what it is that the writer or the poet felt in his heart\n What is it that he appreciated about life what is it that bothered\n\nhim what message does he want to impart\n And you'll be amazed at the way that it sets a mirror in front of\n\nyou and shows you things    in your own life and your\n\nown experiences that help you to understand who you are that helps you to\n\nunderstand others and to empathize\n you sit and watch read the\n\nnewspapers watch cable and look at their   \n\nmotivational presenters that make a bundle of money that have to help\n\nadults who are trying to be successful in business and in their personal\n\nrelationships trying to help them with the very basics that\n\nEnglish teaches us<,> how to understand and how to empathize<,>\n You can't be a successful person unless you can liaise with others\n\nyou can communicate with others and so a personal manager will tell you that\n\nan English Major can write wonderfully and that   \n\nthere's something about their analytical   \n\nskills and there's something about them they're good people persons\n\nand there is something about them\n They have the best track record in terms of being good team\n\nplayers<,>\n Now I actually get a lot of those skills to the type of analysis\n\nthat you learn to do when you're studying English\n fine option that does\n\nprepare you for life\n psychiatrists and psychologists helping people to\n\nstruggle with themselves and you know    all\n\ntheir turmoils and helping them to understand why they feel alienated\n\nor why they feel as if they can't fit into society\n These are themes that we study in English I think always to help us\n\nto appreciate how others can deal with problems and circumstances<,>\n lived by more than\n\nany other I think    is a novel called  To\n\nKill A Mockingbird I can't remember the lawyer's name was it\n\nAtticus<,> the lawyer who represented a black man\n And you know this is something I see in corporate Jamaica every\n\nsingle day without exception\n Here is a lawyer in that work\n sixties thereabouts\n\nand a black man is accused of killing a white woman\n Now let me tell you it's a foregone conclusion\n\n\nin the book his butt is in jail\n\n And I first read that novel when I was in fifth form and again\n\nthroughout my teaching career<,> and what struck me eventually was one simple\n\nmessage\n to evaluate your morals\n\nyour principles what it is you're going to stand up for you're going to\n\nassess the risks of standing by them and come what may you're going to live\n\nby those standards<,> then at the end of the day you retain your self\n\nrespect<,>\n\n\nand  and quite difficult\n And what I found intriguing about that novel was that there were\n\npeople in the court cursing Atticus  fool that you are and why you're\n\ndoing this but quietly they supported and understood and empathized\n And a day doesn't go past when I don't see individuals like that or\n\nunfortunately more often than not people who lack that sort of moral core\n When I look at the C V M reports on the enquiry into the street\n\npeople for instance I see a mass of Jamaicans who are afraid who lack any\n\nmoral core who are  unwilling to stand up and say this is what I know\n\n\nof what is a moral theme in a literary work applied to an everyday\n\nsituation in Jamaica but it helps me as an individual to understand people's\n\nlimitations and to make efforts to improve my life and how I operate\n\n\nI taught because I liked it\n I thought wow summer holidays sounds wonderful and after four years\n\nof teaching I left for the most common reason the salary\n As a matter of fact when I decided to leave T V G because of my\n\ndiscontent  <- > with  with the corporate culture of that\n\norganization the first place I called    was\n\nSister Dorothy at Holy Childhood and I was absolutely appalled at the\n\nsalary\n But I'm going to recommend that for your personal development\n pleasure more personal\n\nsatisfaction than the four years of teaching at Holy Childhood\n I don't think I could sit or stand and try and explain what it is\n\nthat you get as a teacher you've heard it all before\n The personal satisfaction of seeing a young person mature and learn\n\nto appreciate more about themselves the beauty of the English language and\n\nall of that\n But it is a fine contribution to yourself and it does prepare you\n\nas an individual I assure you for any single aspect of corporate life that\n\nyou're interested in pursuing\n\n\nonce  once they've gone through personal training operating as\n\npersonal managers\n Uhm two personal managers one at D N G and the other at Grace tells\n\nme that their experiences at eighty per cent of persons who are successful\n\npeople person people who are customer oriented people who are able to deal\n\nwith pressure with the different circumstances have strong English\n\nbackgrounds\n\n I'm not here to tell you here are one of the following seven or\n\nnine or fifteen career options<,>\n\n You do what you want to do\n If you want to go into computer technology if you want to open your\n\nown business if you want to sell advertising on web sites uhm pff the sky is\n\nthe limit if you want to get into marketing which is a very exciting people\n\nyou know people type uhm area    of corporate life\n If you want to get into law English provides you with such a solid\n\nbase if you take it bit by bit and bite into it the way that poet does when\n\nshe bites into that mango<,>\n Learn to analyse that's all it is\n It's learning how to analyse how to evaluate and then on the more\n\npersonal level how to appreciate and how to empathize\n Once you do that you can peel the appearances away from people you\n\ncan be faced with an employee with a colleague who is bitter    who is caustic who is nasty and mean and see something\n\nbehind that mask\n Because I trust you it is a goose-bumpy feeling\n There are very few real persons I see in corporate life that I\n\ncan't think back to a character in a literary work<,>\n Miguel\n\nStreet\n Remember that mad man who left his faeces on the stool and he goes\n\nabout telling people  stone mi brethren and  \n\n you have to kill him and he's begging the people and daddy said\n\n all right fine is a beating you want a beating you going get\n And somebody picks up a stone and the first stone that lick him\n one piece of cussing start\n There are mad people like that in life you know\n And so maybe I go through life with rose tinted glasses\n I try to read a different piece of literary work at least twice a\n\nyear that sounds bad but there it is at least twice a year\n And someone said to me you know at university cos I asked a lot of\n\npeople for advice I mean    how do I deal with this\n\nthing\n she's like\n\nan aunt to me she's up in her sixties\n now Chantal life is a simple simple cycle you\n\nknow\n you're so full of expectations and\n\nachieving your personal ambitions and goals and all the things that you're\n\ngoing to achieve that somehow you can't see the English fitting in because it\n\ndon't equal dollar bill<,,>\n What an unusual thing to ask you to take your English and have it\n\nwork for you to just improve yourself<,> to be able to help you to broaden\n\nyour perspective to expand the way you look at circumstances social\n\ncircumstances cultural circumstances and appreciate that\n at this\n\nyoung man in the red shirt in front of me I can't make assumptions<,>\n I don't know what I'm looking at and I can't judge a book by its\n\ncover<,>\n And that's the beauty for me that's the beauty of literature\n\n\n  to improvement courses because it's mandated\n\nthat us managers at a certain category we must all undergo certain courses\n\nand I find them a waste of time\n I find them all coming back to literary themes that I've studied\n\nalienation uhm moral decay uhm not knowing who you are or accepting your\n\nsocial circumstances it's all there<,>\n The working world is no glamorous or glitzy it looks wonderful you\n\nknow and you're probably bursting at the seams dying to get out<,> right\n But use that tool use that literary work\n It is written by an individual who has either been pleased by life\n\nor who has suffered as a result of its experiences or who wants to share one\n\nvaluable lesson that he or she has learned\n\n You gonna learn all the wonderful procedures et cetera but to learn\n\nhow to be a human being who can communicate in writing verbally to reach out\n\nto people to sit with kings\n now I\n\nneed forty sales reps across the island    and the\n\nevaluation exercise is an interesting one\n you\n\ntaught this person    or you employed this person\n\nwhat do you think\ne-\n\nacute</*>sum<*>e-acute</*> says things like\n There is one

street\n\nman that look like a  doti urchin he can do it he can reach\n\npeople\n And I interviewed him yesterday and he has a very strong English\n\nbackground he talks about the works works that I

{'text': "<$A>  Thank you very much indeed\n So you started off on a high note and you want to end on a low one\n\nclearly so you decided to ask me\n\n hi my name is Tony Hendricks I am more widely known as\n\nPaleface but more correctly as Tony Hendricks Jamaican Paleface<,>\n\n\nnot Tony Hendricks because obviously I didn't chose that one that was given\n\nto me uhm I merely shortened Tony from Anthony<,> uhm which was given to me\n\nby my mother but, actually so was Paleface<,> given to me not by my mother\n\nuhm<,>\n What I mean is I never invented it the publisher of my book\n\nsuggested the title Tony Hendricks Jamaican Paleface speak with forked\n\ntongue<,> and I shortened that name too<,>\n perhaps\n\nI should have been a rabbi yes<,,>\n\n I realized shortly after my return to Jamaica that as an entertainer\n\nin this country I needed a nickname<,> not just as an entertainer really\n\nalmost everyone in Jamaica has a nickname<,>\n I was with a friend of mine the other day and as he signed all the\n\ncheques for the paybill as he looked at the names on the cheques he had to\n\nask his secretary who each person was<,,>  who's Norman Vaughan<,> hop\n\nalong said his secretary<,>  well I don't know any Kevin\n\nRodin<,> Bogus she added<,>  well who the hell is Arnold \n\nCankow tough luck story<,>\n Alright I accept the fact I don't know the names of any of my\n\nemployees said my friend  but I am damn well certain that we\n\ndon't have anyone working here named Sassafrass Dullberry<,> that is pocket\n\nrestaurant she informed him<,>\n Now pocket restaurant is quite correctly called that as he is\n\nforever pulling food out of his pockets biscuits chips bun and cheese<,>\n\nactually bun and cheese is one of his co-workers in fact<,>\n So I am save in the knowledge that a nickname is as important to a\n\nJamaican as rice and peas U S visa and Christmas bonus<,>\n\n or Paleface for short as you know my\n\nwant is often to shorten things<,>\n\n\nnoms de plumes <, > I am also paid varying degrees of deference by\n\npeople in the street<,> there is a simple and straightforward Paleface<,> and\n\nthere's the longer and more complete television name of Paleface point of\n\nview as opposed to school's challenged grades<,> prime time news Royal Palm\n\nEstate you know<,>\n It's always quite nice when people use your middle names when they\n\ncall to you you know<,> mine being of point of you know\n\n\n courts genie and to show complete and utter respect people add a\n\ntitle such as Sir Paleface<,,>\n\n\ndeference then they call me Mister Point of view<,>\n But as soon as Jamaican Paleface presented itself I knew it was the\n\nright choice it said everything I needed it to my nationality<,> any\n\ndistinguishing characteristics and best of all it was an apparent oxymoron<,>\n\na comic premise irony<,>\n After all the image of Jamaican and Paleface are not often one and\n\nthe same<,>\nAn equally important factor in all of this was that my\n\nnickname didn't say that I was simply a white man a Caucasian\n\n\ncertainly in a group of black men it would be pointless trying to pretend\n\nthat I was anything but the filling in the Orio<,,>\n\n\n<- > I  I proudly informed my interrogator that I was in fact\n\nJamaican to which he rudely added  I thought you had a touch of the\n\ntarbrush in you<,,>\n I said rather spoiling the effect of his\n\nintended insults<,>\n\n\nas it subtracts from my make-up<,> the rest of me my whole and I am very\n\nproud to be of such mixed ethnicity\n There's no denying that I am half white half English in fact but\n\nlet's face it you never hear anybody overtly say they are English anything<,>\n You'll hear Irish-American African- American Hispanic-American\n\nLesbian-American<,> you'll get French-Chinese Dutch-West- African and Jewish\n\neverything<,>\n Even the English say they're British so as not to leave out the\n\nIrish Welsh and Scots<,> they need backup<,>\n But these other Brits are only too happy to leave out the English\n\nand do so at every possible in opportunity English bastards Sassenach

all got dreadlocks and they all can sing<,> if you really\n\nare a Jamaican sing a song<,,> in reggae<,> like it was another\n\nlanguage<,>\n oh you come to my country and ask\n\nme all that kind of

{'text': "<$A>  Good afternoon to you all\n It is certainly a pleasure to be here\n My presentation will be brief\n What I hope to do is to generate some discussion and to entertain\n\nquestions that you may have and    hopefully I will be\n\nable to address them<,>\n Let me make my presentation and then I will entertain any questions\n\nyou may have\n\n\n\ngrandson of His Imperial Majesty Emperor Haile Selassie the first visited\n\nJamaica along with his cousin <unclear> name</unclear> Tewodros\n The princes had occasion to meet with a group of Rastafari\n\nsisters<,> in what was a historic and memorable gathering<,>\n\n\nrecollection in my mind is the Prince's reverence for the Rasta woman\n Prince David told us of an Ethiopian proverb which he wrote for us\n\nin Amharic that  a man who is lead by a woman never fails<,>\n Also we were told that in Ethiopia the Rasta woman remains in the\n\nhills for the most part<,> so much so that whenever she makes herself visible\n\nfor example by coming into the city people are often struck with terror\n\nbecause    the significance of sighting this woman\n\nforetold either a miracle or a tragedy<,>\n The Rasta woman has always maintained an aura of mystery\n and in\n\nearlier years of the movement may well have been perceived as a\n\ndisenfranchised downtrodden woman walking ten paces behind her king man<,>\n Certainly however the perception of the black woman as queen is a\n\nreality which has been revived by Rastafari<,> as a whole which has rekindled\n\nin African peoples our royal lineage and heritage<,>\n\n The royal line of Ethiopia has its roots and foundation in the\n\nQueen of Sheba who bore her only son Menelik for King Solomon of biblical\n\nglory<,>\n\n\nGlory of Kings recounts the history of the union between the    Queen of Sheba Queen Makada and King Solomon<,>\n Queen Makada had heard of the great wisdom of King Solomon and had\n\nvisited his kingdom seeking council and guidance\n Solomon was awed by Makada's beauty and desired that she become his\n\nqueen and bear his child<,>\n By a ruse Solomon succeeded in his desire to unite with the\n\nqueen<,>\n Makada although with child decided to return to her own empire the\n\nrich and powerful Ethiopia which she ruled with dignity\n Nine months later Menelik was born and thus begun the great line of\n\nemperors of Ethiopia<,,>\n Empress\n\nTaitu beg your pardon who reigned along<,> with Emperor Menelik and\n\nwho<,,> when the Emperor faltered and became indecisive when attacked by the\n\nItalians at Adowa commanded her troops forward onto the battle field thus\n\nleading the Ethiopians into perhaps the singular most important battle of the\n\nAfrican continent the Battle of Adowa on March first eighteen ninety-six\n\nwhereby the Ethiopians emerged victorious and the Italians slaughtered<,,>\n queens because the Rastafari woman is\n\nof course seen as a queen\n What is beautiful about the Rastafari woman is that her regal\n\nbearing is apparent no matter what her role in life may be<,>\n Thus the sister who tends the fields and plants her vineyard in the\n\nhills does so with a love and reverence for Creation and nature<,,>\n who bears and grows her children instils in them that\n\nconfidence in self and the teachings that all that is good may be\n\nattained<,,>\n The daughter who teaches in the classroom or practises law in the\n\ncourts or engages in whatever occupation encourages and inspires both male\n\nand female<,> young and old to move forward in life\n November second marks the sixty-seventh anniversary of the\n\ncoronation of Emperor Haile Selassie the first and his queen Empress Menen\n The night before the coronation was spent by their majesties in\n\nprayer<,> as they prepared to receive the crowns in the double<,> ceremony\n\nthe following day\n Empress Menen was of royal blood\n very often hear much of Empress Menen but of course\n\nshe was in fact crowned Empress and I have heard persons refer to her as\n\nPrincess persons within the Rastafari faith not giving her her full<,>\n\ntitle<,>\n She was the granddaughter of king Michael of Wollo and was a woman\n\nof considerable wealth\n Undoubtedly she was a source of strength to the Emperor the mother\n\nof his children and the person who provided comfort advice and balance\n Such is the case with the woman in Rastafari\n We accept that it is our role to strengthen the family and in so\n\ndoing we share a duty with the father<,,>\n\n and produce food in the form of\n\nmilk for our offspring\n And although the Rastafari movement has been viewed as male\n\ndominated time has proven that in order to give effect to divine law and\n\norder<,> the woman must be respected as much as the man\n\n Somehow however in religious movements and in earth runnings in\n\ngeneral man gained the dominant role and in so doing dictated certain rules\n\n <- > and  and regulations relating to woman\n I do feel that there is a wind of change necessarily\n The enlightened man has come to recognize that the closest thing to\n\ndivinity is in the form of a woman\n\n The whole process of creation and giving birth is so miraculous\n\nthat no longer is the man content to malign and discredit womanhood as a\n\ncarrier of sin\n by\n\nmany<,> that woman is in fact God<,>\n It used to be thought that woman the Rasta woman could only access\n\nor see God through the man<,>\n It is accepted now that we all have the power to communicate with\n\nthe Creator and to access and awaken that divine nature within us all<,>\n\n and know that\n\nour person our purpose is to fulfil the divine will<,>\n\n There are certain principles and practices that are peculiar to the\n\nmovement and are well-known\n that repatriation is a\n\nmust and that African people are   \n\ndeserving of reparations<,,>\n It is unarguable that the Rasta woman is an integral part of the\n\nfurther development of our nation<,>\n has to be some formal\n\napproach made<,> whether to a head of state or with any concern of the\n\nRastafari movement we find that the woman is ever present and plays an\n\nimportant role<,>\n\n Recently the Rastafari community had occasion to meet with\n\nPresident Rowlings of Ghana on his visit to Jamaica<,,> and<,,> a\n\npresentation was made an overview was made by  Ras Morty McClanal one\n\nof the<,> forefront Elders of the Rastafari movement<,,> and there was a\n\ngeneral discourse between the President and the Movement<,>\n What was interesting at that meeting from the perspective of the\n\nRasta woman is that the meeting was in fact chaired by a Rasta woman\n Now in times gone by it would be very unusual to find a Rasta woman\n\nstanding in the position of chair for a meeting of that magnitude\n And perhaps of even greater importance is the fact that it was\n\nanother Rasta woman<,> Sister Yvonne Hope who actually took the initiative\n\nand made contact with the powers that be and had the meeting convened which\n\nif it were not for her initiative certainly would not have happened<,,>\n Uh certainly an example is set in terms of attire and bearing\n The bearing of the body is discouraged and the emphasis is upon\n\nAfrican attire and modesty\n This is not to be mistaken with dowdiness or boring wardrobe\n On the contrary we have popularised African clothing so that it now\n\nhas become the preferred mode of dress for many people\n\n In addition to being part of the cultural retention of Africa the\n\ncovering of the head also refers to the biblical adage which states that\n\n it is good for a woman's head to be covered when praying and\n\nprophesying\n And of course when you think of or perceive the Rasta woman as\n\nprophetess this would relate to what Prince David had mentioned to us<,,>\n\nwhen he met with us those years ago\n Whereby when a Rasta woman that is a woman who wears locks is seen\n\nin Ethiopia it would be cause for concern because she was and is a prophetess\n\nand so it would foretell that something was about to happen\n In earlier times Rasta woman would be loved to reveal her locks her\n\ncrowning glory and covenant\n Nowadays many of us but by no means the majority do carry our heads\n\nuncovered but for ceremonial occasions and Rastafari gatherings the head must\n\nbe covered<,>\n The woman in Rastafari has in these times brought to the fore the\n\npresent phenomena of natural beauty\n It is true that there still lingers a bias among our people towards\n\nlighter complexioned women with    Caucasian\n\nfeatures but this leaning is not as strong as it once was\n Women generally are becoming more comfortable with themselves\n There is now proliferation of natural hairstyle including the\n\nwearing of locks by non-Rasta women\n Again the woman in Rastafari can take a great deal of credit for\n\nhelping our sisters to love themselves<,,> but physical appearance is only\n\none aspect of the Rasta woman's persona<,>\n Like Empress Taitu she often finds herself in the leadership\n\nposition\n In such instances it is necessary to take charge of affairs and go\n\nforward<,> and in that regard she is in fact sovereign\n I made reference to Queen Makada who is known popularly as the\n\nQueen of Sheba<,>\n draw analogy to the queens\n\nbecause we recognize that the strength and magnitude<,,> that is within us\n\ncan only be harnessed and brought to the fore if we recognize that it is\n\nthere in the first place\n taught to feel that\n\nwe are beneath\n\n\nwe know that we have played a decisive role as part of that<,>\n\nchanging process<,,>\n The strength and magnitude which exist within us may appear to be\n\nsubmerged between an exterior calm and quiet dignity but it will rise to the\n\nfore when deemed necessary\n We recognize that there is a queen within us all and that it is up\n\nto us to awaken and maintain our queenly character<,>\n you see more Rasta woman than you had seen\n\nformerly<,> because in our sovereign nature we have oftentimes  <- > find\n\nit  found it necessary to take charge of house and home and in\n\nso doing we can no longer just sit at home and take care of children although\n\nwe are not saying that that is not an important role\n the\n\nmost important role because in terms of raising the family and the children\n\nthis dictates what tomorrow will bring<,>\n But we have to at times take care of the greater nation and I know\n\nthat some years ago in fact I see sitting in the audience one of the Rasta\n\nwoman who I would make reference to\n\n\nHewitt Mammar Cultural School because Rastafari children children wearing\n\nlocks have been discriminated against and some schools still do discriminate\n\nagainst

{'text': "<$A> \n\n  and the opportunity<,>\n\n\ndi I   I did one last year I think it was called\n\nthe politics of dancehall<,,> but especially uhm in the light of recent\n\nevents I know that a lot of people will appreciate that uhm<,> there's a lot\n\nof dancehall    in politics<,>\n especially since the last twenty years the music play a\n\npart in the politics right from the beginning<,> but not really dancehall\n\nmusic because there wasn't even that dance in nineteen-thirty at the end of\n\n<unclear> two-words</unclear> and plenty people will know that you know and\n\nother things\n popular songs both religious songs\n\nanything that was attached to the political struggle the nationalist struggle\n\nand the later  Partland struggle but it wasn't really dancehall until\n\nabout nineteen sixty-six to own our own referendum and    dancehall as we know it in fact it\n\nreally came in nearly twenty years later<,>\n come to\n\nresemble one another in Jamaica  come to resemble one another even\n\nmore<,> because you know    since\n\nabout the early eighties<,> the two political parties uhm<,,>\n\nresemble one another more than before even though there isn't a one of the\n\n very close in the<,> forties and fifties the old divergence in the\n\nsixties and seventies and early eighties but they come to resemble one\n\nanother much more<,> since the early eighties especially since<,> the Cold\n\nWar and the bipolar world parting break down<,> and therefore like\n\ndancehall<,> as against the protest music and the lyrics and the songs of the\n\nearly time of the sixties and the seventies dancehall is mostly D J music\n\nwhich all did it of a lot of good social commentary and protest content<,>\n\n\nand  and because of that just like the  the\n\npoliticians who find it harder to interest the people and all you kinda know\n\nthe majority of the people now are uncommitted more than fifty per cent\n And the politicians find it harder to interest the people except at\n\nour own election time<,>\n As I said just like the dancehall artists which are not very many\n\nsingers again<,>\n The dancehall artists of the last many years have found it very\n\ndifficult to interest the people in the way that Bob Marley interest the\n\npeople<,>\n And because of that they have certain themes about five themes that\n\nthem always drop  just like the way gonna drop off is one of the\n\ndancehall slogan when two sound clash  come even when two bodies\n\ncoming like    is a sound clash\n\n\nprac  practised within the political arena and vice versa\n And when them run out of steam you know in our days the artists uh\n\nespecially D Js and audience when them run out of steam the Marleys know that\n\nthere's certain things them can drive on and the Marleys get a lot of cheers\n\nand sometime them get all the mics through a to a street just  look out\n\nthem what the did on these theme\n the commercial sexuality not just\n\nsexuality as we know it we do that perfectly  legitimate thing\n\nbut you know<,> the whole <unclear> word</unclear> and girl lyrics and\n\nthing<,> which plenty people are surprised how much the girls and the dancers\n\nare enthusiastic about it but this kind of music make them descend our\n\nattraction it make them get a bucks of beer free    a\n\ndate and connection a month and therefore even though you might think it is\n\n   it happened in nineteen seventy if I do remember the other\n\nside you've had in ninety-seven towards the <unclear> word</unclear> because\n\nthe    and P N P is usually more\n\neffective    in music<,>\n\n\n and I have to say that the music<,> in my mind never decide any\n\nelection<,> and don't think that many amount of people don't think that the\n\nmusic make them win or lose\n But what the music does it that when it strike a responsive cord\n\nwhether there's a selection of music or one music when it strike as uhm\n\nresponsive cord among the people<,> it exhilarate the work of the political\n\nworkers and get them a lot of energy<,> and them have a lot of energy to go\n\nout there and work hard and just be confident    and\n\nuhm exuberant and so on<,> and also it draw attention to their needs and then\n\nbring people there<,> and the actual speeches of politicians become a\n\nsideshow<,> and the music and the total of the music and the gossip of the\n\nmusic and the expectancy about what the music is really talking about is the\n\nmain thing and that pull the people there<,>\n kind of uhm give the sense in\n\nwhich<,>    we can realise that\n Don't think that the music really win or lose election but it's\n\nsomething    that has had to be used both\n\nbecause of running out of the real political steam and also<,> because it is\n\none of the more harmless things that don't bind them to any real commitment\n\ndown the road\n before I go any further I'd like indulge myself by introduce\n\nmy wife and my daughter Sandra and Amber<,,>\n So in the interest of maintaining your interest I have prepared\n\nthis presentation not in a strictly chronological sequence but it will be\n\neasy to be reminded of the developments of the last forty years\n Because I know that everything I talk about and I know a lot of\n\npeople don't know it either what is us a reminder even to people who are not\n\nforty years old  things will be quiet from me the ones who remind me\n\nof them<,,>\n Uhm after my initial comment we can glance at the most recent and\n\nprovoking sound clash<,>\n regular feature of\n\ndancehall and    it's like one of the politics\n And you know that the most recent sound clash was not these\n\nuh and like Sting last year December every\n\nyear that ought to be one of the biggest stage show the biggest stage show\n\nfor some years now has been Tony Rebel Rebel Salute<,> but I think the second\n\nbiggest one although it was dying a few years ago and this is why them come\n\nwith these  liquor they come with these  liquor thing set up\n\nthings to revive the thing because it was dying unnaturally\n\n\nMerciless<,> won the sound clash and mash up Bounty Killa or beat him on up\n\nmashed them up bad    and uhm when Ninjaman who\n\nnamed Desmond uhm<,> Ballantine motherfucker Merciless say a dead man\n\nBallantine you can't kill them longtime you know\n So this is the kind that we know\n And the promoter set up these things sometimes one of these D J\n\ncome out really out perform I gonna I really kill them like that one song I\n\nreally wanna kill that song<,>\n And sometime it's set up that way just like all the price-fighting\n\ngame is set up<,> that you have a narrow loss    or\n\na robbery this time an indignation and a early re- match and plenty\n\nmore rolling and you know  Dunkin learned plenty from we and we\n\nlearned plenty from  Dunkin\n there\n\nor surprising<,> but I saying I don't feel although  <- > it \n\nit might be a trend don't believe like    is any  perm uh  portent of things to\n\ncome yet it could be you know but don't just look as uhm the <unclear>\n\none-word</unclear> counted that way\n But what I am saying is uhm another thing I wanna say a lot of\n\npeople bawl out after it<,> and you know in indignation and how a certain\n\nthing was outrageous and it should  you know   \n\nhow could they do this kind of job kind of nasty people bringing them\n\nyou know<,> is only to call them lose because remember that side usually very\n\nmore efficient in the use of music and when them win it was getting them\n\n<unclear> two words</unclear><,>\n As I say in ninety-seven the Labour Party tried to do the same\n\n<unclear> word</unclear>  forwarding by using Buju Banton Boom Bye\n\nBye<,> and I remember say Buju Banton himself had to kind of withdraw after\n\nand was getting big on the scene and this is    one of the\n\nreason why these guys not getting as big as Bob Marley<,>\n Was getting big on the international scene in both in the gay\n\ncommunity internationally which is you know community    is not just<,> like population communities\n\nthen there's economic communities also and then there's professional\n\ncommunities which is where begin media and in entertainment and    when them block listen them pressure <unclear>\n\nwords</unclear> they don't withdraw them thing they <unclear> word</unclear>\n\nthey go next door they <unclear> words</unclear> at them and quietly turn\n\nthat down and so on and so forth    you\n\nknow you haven't too much fun Boom Boom Bye Bye thing<,>\n good still which is also a form of\n\npragmatism you know<,>\n as I say this uh homophobia thing was used in music by\n\nthe same side in a general election in ninety-seven<,> never worked never\n\nhelped them<,>\n And even when it was used that idea I don't think it really help\n\nthem win an election for them<,> but    in the\n\ncontext of the ruling party losing a stronghold it was most aggravating to\n\nhear this music playing over and over and over and knowing say things about\n\nsliding and sliding and sliding\n\n It's a music that come already out couple of years ago run a little\n\nwhile and dead and was still<,>    and got a\n\nnew lease and life through the political use of it<,>\n the guys make more money and into well more well- known\n\nnow and    just I tell it the dancehall \n\nruled them/rhythm politician world\n I don't know if you ever heard of the group P O K have uhm since\n\nuhm the election<,> how skilfully they ever fighted and denied what the\n\nlyrics mean    and them are real politician<,>\n So the politics have learned from the music and the musicians has\n\nlearned from the politics same way", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

behind me name me\n\nno have no money broke bad\n just wanna also say Miss Ethel\n\nWhiteman principal at Westwood\n When I saw her this evening it didn't matter if anybody else came\n\ncos to see the principal at Westwood who suspend me from school for poor\n\nconduct come here to see me it was really something for me and I must just\n\nsay that when I was at Westwood\n I was very\n\ndisplaced domestically you know my father was an alcoholic and in\n\nthose days people didn't know things about seeking attention\n you just come a school come be of\n\nmental because you cannot be of that way at home\n People didn't understand that while you were there standing around\n\npretending to be very brave  when them suspend you ya say  Lord\n\nGod papa go kill me now<,>   \n\nyou can't allow your emotions to come through because  first thing\n\nto commence with my peer groups expect me to be the bad girl you know<,>\n run me and me know papa a go\n\nkill me me just a say well she said me a go home you know\n start to cry because at\n\nthat time I was supposed to even when other children talk in a class \n\nme just go say a me cos me a bad woman\n Anyway fortunately for me I had one of them most uhm instrumental\n\nweapons in my life I have mama my mother who saw through all of this and even\n\nwhen my father was there and they suspend me from school and my father say\n\n  well me cyaan get no dinner mama said to him\n\n Ken Christine cannot get any dinner  but when me \n\ndung a banana walk they  my little dinner coming down\n\nthere along with several page of bible verse<,> to read and I\n\nremember Miss Whiteman as a principal\n I really loved her at school but I could not allow her to know that\n\nyou know because I'm a bad woman\n Bad people don't show emotion\n No sir me a bad woman\n\n\n\nreally loved me but she couldn't afford to show me either because as a\n\nprincipal and I remember once when she was suspending me you know and I'm\n\nsitting in front of her you know and just pretending that I don't care that\n\nshe's suspending me\n One a i time you know me look sideway when me look back I\n\nsaw a tear in her eye corner and me say cho, the woman you no hate me you\n\nknow but <unclear> words</unclear>\n And then now it's really I didn't know I learned anything at all\n\nfrom Miss Whiteman  no sir cos me not listen when she had talk\n\nsay but it was after I became an adult now and I\n\nwent over there and the fact that I was not allowed to graduate really hurt\n\nme because I felt  that them should a just understand say whoo me\n\nbright academically me bright and conduct no really matter no matter how me a\n\ngo on me shoulda graduate but then it was after I got out now had my\n\nown business I recognize that when I had to fire a staff member that I love\n\nvery much very good computer person but very poor attitude  me realize\n\n say watch you it take more than just<,> academics\n a friend of mine fax me that very concerned diatribe editorial\n\nyesterday in the Star about whether or not I would use this platform    to castigate    and\n\nexpound upon my personal uhm what you would a call it now disaffection of the\n\nbusiness\n I'm a very intelligent woman and I say that without apology and I\n\nhave the art of <unclear> word(s)<unclear>\n I walk with me own photographer see him they him ever ready in case\n\nnobody no take no picture of me \n Yes and uhm alright I didn't plan to talk anything about meself but\n\nthere is something I must say something about meself\n Now I don't want to reiterate what my sister colleague in the\n\nbusiness Louise Frazer-Bennett had said a couple weeks ago about the\n\ndifficulties that women face in the business because I'm uh think she handled\n\nthe matter well and I want to just say the fact that there are so many women\n\nstill in the business not just as artist but also as journalist Mrs Jasmin\n\n Perrud editor of the excess magazine\n solid agency\n We have even some women who are not prominent out there but are the\n\nbackbone of the men who are prominent\n The fact that because any woman that is the wife or the Mrs of a\n\nreggae artist you know  must did come straight from heaven and\n\nnever stop nowhere you know<,> because   \n\nit's an extraordinary skill to be the wife of a person that is in\n\nsomething that is not even recoupable on paper<,>\n You cannot count what you're going to get back from it\n don't want\n\n   to expound upon   \n\nthe effect that deleterious lyrics and other negative uhm exposition\n\nhas on the music because I think brother Luciano handled that well last\n\nweek<,>\n I just wanna say here now that the demise of reggae music we have\n\nso many things that are spoken about\n We talk about lack of creativity lack of talent\n I have to disagree with that\n We have a lot of talent here\n We have a lot of creativity here because if a person can sit down\n\nand make up a song about the female anatomy<,> albeit it's sometimes in a\n\nvulgar way that is a extremely creative way of using biology<,>\n The fact that it has negative connotations is another matter you\n\nknow\n\n\n and    I\n\n\n buk up this book   \n\nit's an edition of it's a revise you know edition of Webster's\n\nCollegiate Thesaurus\n It was revised in nineteen twenty-eight\n Since that they have had several revisions but I took out some that\n\nsaid what is music\n Music is sound arranged into technically correct score with\n\nan international appeal for example Mozart<,> that is  what\n\nthey think say you know is music<,>\n therefore the talking drums of Africa\n\ncould not be construed as music since    it has\n\nonly ethnic  mean to it\n When I go to Africa and the African them a dance I can't tell them\n\nthat<,>\n will not dance\n\nto it because they don't understand\n So we have if not only an understanding of a way of life of a\n\npeople which translates into the culture based on your ethnic or geographic\n\nplacing it also has to do with what the human being wishes to absorb because\n\nI could go some place else and the person wishes to absorb Mozart even though\n\nit's not their original culture\n what is talent is it that\n\nwhich one has an aptitude for\n cos many people fi say whoo\n\nman a big artist man a big singer and from him I try sing til now the only\n\nperson who am a big singer a him\n You understand but he has an attitude but not the aptitude for\n Therefore this goes to say that the fact that you think you can do\n\nsomething does not a master of it make\n\n Career is a chosen path of endeavour in which an individual\n\nis successful in carrying out his talent so therefore if a man\n\n say boy me is a career criminal    he\n\nhas a career\n What if him a broke people place for years an them\n\nnever catch him\n\n Now I'm just trying to take this out of this social connotations\n\nyou know\n\n\nwhether or not it is socially acceptable behaviour now is another matter<,>\n\nwhat if a man can fight good man me no mean as a boxer you know\n Walk on kick down and lick down people him fight\n\ngood but whether or not his behaviour is socially acceptable is\n\nanother matter which brings us around now to how talent and career and the\n\nlack of understanding of what they mean contributes to the demise of reggae\n\nmusic and not just reggae to music in general or the arts in general and what\n\nhappen is that a person can have a talent but talent\n\nby itself will not stand\n It needs a lot of things chief of which especially if talent is to\n\nbe translated into career has to be capital<,>  a money run\n\nthings<,> and the capital that we are talking about is not just to\n\nsay  whatcha<,> boy me go me go press a tshune < \n take a note of that word you know tshune\n is different from tune you know\n is the one where the man sing Monday and say\n\nhim bus Tuesday I'm a big artist that is a  tshune<,> totally\n\ndifferent from tune\n any\n\nlyrically satisfying sound to it\n A man just go in on and say no please let me divert a little\n Unu ever go a stage show yet and hear a man come up on\n\nstage and him say step down  Dugy Ranks\n mind do you know he's\n\nnot built for the show he got an opportunity<,> the band ah play hear him \n\nwheels up bands man<,>\n man a big heavy artist you know man of\n\ntshune a road you know man not get no money you know and producer a\n\nrob rob man you know\n\n\n if him did big so the crowd now\n\nwould no fling ah some buckle after him    if he come\n\noff a stage<,> because they would have understood the fact that he has these\n\n tshunes but it's I'm just saying you look\n Now when I look and I here people saying that man talented\n\n\ntomorrow unless it is carefully crafted and developed you have to\n\ncraft talent<,> because for example if I am managing Dr Cooper here<,> I as\n\nthe manager or the person who's gonna invest capital has to understand how\n\nbest to position

{'text': "<$A>  the meaning of the\n\nResurrection of Christ<,>\n The passage that we read is set in a particular context and just to\n\ngive you a background it was the day of Pentecost<,> and<,>  \n\n the disciples who were meeting together in the upper room had\n\njust been<,> experiencing a supernatural visitation from the Holy Spirit\n The Holy Spirit was poured out upon the believers and they were all\n\nfilled with the spirit and spoke in unknown tongues as the spirit gave them\n\nutterance\n It was a tremendous time of powerful manifestation of the spirit of\n\nGod on the day of Pentecost<,>\n disturbance that was caused by the visitation of the\n\nspirit was noised abroad and how many of you know that the Holy Spirit is not\n\nafraid of noise he sometimes is the originator of a lot of noise and somebody\n\nsays you know God is not deaf and so we can be quiet and somebody else said\n\nwell God is not nervous either so we can experience a situation where we can\n\nmake joyful noise before God and God won't get nervous about it\n Well on the day of Pentecost there was a tremendous noise that was\n\ncreated as these believers spoke in tongues for the first time<,> and many\n\npeople came to hear<,> this commotion and when they came closer they heard<,>\n\nthese people speaking in their own dialects<,>\n Jews had gathered on the day of Pentecost from all over the then\n\nknown world\n They had come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover and then the\n\nday of Pentecost and so it was a time when these Jews from all over were\n\npresent and they heard this supernatural thing happening they heard these\n\nuntrained people speaking in languages that they had never learned and they\n\ncould recognize that God was<,> speaking to them and was glorifying himself\n\nin praise<,>\n and he stood up with the other\n\napostles<,> and he proclaimed a gospel message<,>\n\n publicly\n\nafter the ascension of Jesus Christ<,>\n And it was a proclaimed power by one who was a denier of Jesus\n He denied the Lord Jesus Christ he was a traitor but the Lord Jesus\n\nrestored him and empowered him to preach the message of the gospel aren´t you\n\nglad that God is in the restoration business<,>\n Peter was the man who denied Jesus three times\n Jesus had to go and find him after his Resurrection and restore him\n\nand Jesus gave Peter the keys to the kingdom and Peter was using these keys\n\nto unlock the prison doors of the people who he was preaching to and    allow them to enter into the kingdom of God<,>\n\n\n It was a message which really dealt with the meaning of the\n\nResurrection<,>\n Many people grappled with whether or not Jesus really rose from the\n\ndead literally\n Sometimes you hear people speak about the Resurrection but if you\n\nlisten closely they are not talking about the Resurrection of Jesus literally\n\nand physically they're talking about something else\n Sometimes even when we sing songs like uhm he is alive he's risen\n\nuhm how do you know that he lives<,>\n\n But is it that Jesus only lives within our hearts or was there a\n\nhistorical point when he rose from the dead literally and physically\n I don't know if you have been following some of these\n\nsemi-documentaries that come on around Easter time when great scholars\n\npontificate about the meaning of the Resurrection and the crucifixion and\n\nthey give theirs learned opinion<,>\n I am sometimes appalled listening to them because they make such\n\nspeculative conclusions which have no basis at all in fact that you wonder if\n\nthese men really are serious\n Some of them speak about Jesus being risen in the hearts of all\n\nmankind just as how Bob Marley lives Jesus lives just as how Karl Marx lives\n\nin the hearts and the breasts of his followers Jesus lives\n But the question we must ask is is the Resurrection a fact or is it\n\nfiction\n\n Does it have a meaning did it happen or didn't it happen\n Is it true or isn't it true\n Is it significant or isn't it significant\n Does it really matter\n And I notice that some of these scholars because of their\n\ncommitment prior to investigating the facts their commitment to a world where\n\nmiracles are impossible they have great difficulty believing that Jesus\n\nreally rose from the dead literally and physically\n But the Bible says that Jesus rose from the dead on the third day\n It was a datable historical factual event and nothing can change\n\nthat amen<,>\n and you\n\nmight say to me how can you use scripture to support and confirm the\n\nResurrection\n\n The scriptures were all written and circulated within the lifetime\n\nof those people who would have witnessed the Resurrection\n First Corinthian's fifteen Paul describes six different appearances\n\nof Jesus and he said that many of the people who experienced the appearance\n\nof Jesus were people who were still alive at the time when he wrote because\n\nfirst Corinthians was written within eight or nine years of the Resurrection\n You know brethren there was not enough time for legend to develop\n\nthere was not enough time for a story to come up which would erase the\n\nhistorical facts\n It's just too short and the people who are experts in legend tell\n\nus that legendary accretion takes a couple of generations\n You cannot have a legend established within a few years which is\n\ndifferent from the historical facts\n So I cannot come to you people who were around during the time of\n\nBob Marley and tell you that Bob Marley got up out of the grave and was\n\nsinging Redemption Songs in Halfway Tree Square and how five hundred people\n\nsaw him doing this\n I cannot tell you that you'd laugh me to scorn\n and you\n\ndidn't hear of any such event and so I could not fool you by circulating any\n\ndocuments with that story\n I would be laughed to scorn\n Yet the New Testament documents were circulated far and wide within\n\nthe lifetime of those people who witnessed the events\n you men\n\nof Israel listen to this Jesus of Nazareth was a man accredited by God to you\n\nby miracles wonders and signs which God did among you through him as you\n\nyourselves know<,>\n So they could appeal to the knowledge of the people who were alive\n\nat that time<,,>\n\n\ncough<,>it says after Jesus is suffering he showed himself to these men\n\nand gave many convincing proofs<,,> that he was alive\n He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the\n\nkingdom of God<,>\n I just want\n\nto notice  us to notice that<,> he was doing what<,> sit down\n\nand eat a meal with them<,>\n\n\n The evidence is very strong first and foremost that there was an\n\nempty tomb<,>\n You may say that it could have been a plot where people the\n\ndisciples themselves stole away the body of Christ and that is why they\n\ncouldn't find the body\n But you have to remember that the Roman Empire and the Government\n\nof Rome    was very interested in ensuring that the\n\nbody of Christ could be produced and that any such plot could be exposed you\n\nsee\n Scholars tell us that during that time there were about twenty\n\ndifferent insurrections led by people claiming to be messiahs trying to\n\noverthrow the Roman Government<,>\n There were revolutionaries that came up about twenty of them around\n\nthe time of Christ<,>\n Every time one came up the Roman Government suppressed the uprising\n\nthe rebellion and killed the messiah<,>\n And that was the end of that movement until the next one came and\n\nthen the next\n So they were used to this idea of messiahs coming up leading some\n\nkind of rebellion and having to put them down\n would not come up with any\n\nsuch plot or scheme or anything like that and that when he was killed by them\n\nthat he was going to remain dead and so they guarded the tomb and put the\n\nRoman seal on the tomb<,> only to find that on Easter Sunday the tomb was\n\nempty<,> the seal was broken    the four-ton\n\nstone that was covering the entrance was moved<,> and the centurion the\n\nguards that were there fled in terror<,>\n And this was a serious thing because when they guarded something\n\nlike that<,> if they failed in their assignment they were punished by death\n So it was no joke business you couldn't bribe a man to look the\n\nother way<,> because him not going get just a reprimant he was gonna get\n\npunished by death<,,>\n\n\n alive\n\nJesus<,> Amen<,>\n\n And then there is the evidence of the transformed lives of the\n\ndisciples<,>\n many of\n\nthem were so disillusionned after the crucifixion<,> that they became\n\nsceptical you remember Thomas<,,>\n Thomas was a major sceptic even when the reports start to come in\n\nThomas said boy unless I see for myself and I can put my finger into the\n\nnail-scarred hands and push my  hand into his side I will not\n\nbelieve<,,>\n and\n\ndisplayed to him the fact that he was indeed risen<,>\n And Jesus at that occasion got fish and bread and ate it and he\n\nsaid  see I am not a  duppy<,>\n\n\ndon't eat fish and bread<,>\n see I can eat\n\nfish I can eat bread<,>\n\n my Lord and my\n\nGod<,> and Jesus said  bless at our doubt Thomas<,> we call\n\nyou see and believe what about those who don't see and yet believe they are\n\nthe ones who are really gonna be blessed<,,>\n the\n\ngreat apostle James\n How many of you know that James was actually the real brother half\n\nbrother of the Lord Jesus Christ\n James was sceptical about Jesus being the messiah\n James felt that how could this brother of mine be claiming to be\n\nany messiah I know him him grow up in a carpenter's shop as my big brother I\n\nknow him it was not no messiah\n In fact James and Jesus's other half brothers and sisters came one\n\ntime to carry him to Belleview because they were convinced that he had gone\n\noff his rockers<,,> and they were actually supporting the myth that look he\n\nhas finally flipped he's gone<,>\n well there\n\nyou go<,> my own brother fool don't have no sense at all go make them men\n\nthem crucify him say him is king of kings and Lord of Lords and saviour of\n\nthe world deluded<,,>\n But the Bible says in first Corinthian's fifteen that he appeared\n\nto James<,>\n from one of the biggest\n\nsceptics<,> to the great apostle of Jerusalem<,,> amen<,>\n And then there was another little bald-head hook-nosed short-\n\nsighted cross-eyed bow-legged Jew named Saul of Tarsus<,> who claimed that he\n\nwas going to eradicate the sect that was giving such a bad name

the music reached the people<,>\n\n After World War Two in the late nineteen forties Jamaicans had few\n\nchoices available to them for hearing recorded music<,>\n There was a part-time radio station with a call sign Z Q I\n It operated for a short period only each day to broadcast the\n\nnews<,>\n\n The selections were mostly American tunes with a few other Western\n\nor Latin American pop recordings<,>\n Radios and gramophones for playing seventy eight R P M records\n\nwhich were the recordings of the time<,> were found only in the homes of\n\nwell-off residents\n The broad mass of the population had little opportunity to hear\n\nbroadcasted or recorded music<,>\n Three developments occurred between the late nineteen forties and\n\nearly nineteen fifties<,>\n\n\n\nrec  a record player<,>\n The systems played at dances in the city yards halls or street\n\ncorners<,>\n in one of the most important scientific breakthroughs of the\n\ncentury<,> the transistor was developed to replace bulky inefficient vacuum\n\ntubes<,>\n The pocket transistor radio became available for play at home at\n\nwork and in between<,>\n Z Q I was replaced by Radio Jamaica and Radio Fusion\n\nknown as R J R<,,>\n Radio Fusion was a cable network of speaker boxes for homes or\n\noffices through which music was piped from R J R at a four double rates<,>\n By mid-nineteen fifties Jamaicans were in a much better position to\n\nenjoy and be    entertained by recorded\n\nmusic<,>\n Radio stations in near-by American states could be received and\n\nrecent American recordings could

in the R n B style at that\n\ntime was a song that will be little known to you but was very popular    in the\n\n\n\n and that was the prevalent beat of the\n\ntime<,,>\n\n to find unique\n\nrecordings which would not be known to others<,>\n These choice recordings were a vital part of the sound systems\n\nrepertoire in establishing which sound was champion<,>\n as\n\nsurprise

the sounds of\n\nrivals nearby<,>\n\n to dissuade\n\npatrons from attending rival dances<,> but mostly the competitive edge was\n\nsecured by having exclusive records to play which would draw the crowd<,,>\n\n\nto remove the record label<,>\n and\n\nsold in very limited numbers<,> at exorbitant prices and profits<,>\n gradually in larger quantities at\n\ndecreasing prices<,,>\n or even

human\n\nform<,> in other words the Almighty walking upon the earth and that that\n\nhuman being can be both human and divine<,,>\n\n\nHindu philosophy<,> that sort of a god king image<,> \n\nSarosta<,> and others<,>\n\n\nsometimes you might hear some virgin define it that way as the reincarnation\n\nof Christ that a new guard to His Imperial Majesty in other words that\n\nreincarnation which has come again\n In reality it is that same spirit which had trod the earth two\n\nthousand years ago that has now trod within this era of time<,>\n ancient\n\nprinciples uhm for example the moon of his I principle<,> with the moon of\n\nhis I principle which was a principle which really took root uh or one should\n\nsay becomes took some form of formality at the council of Nicia at three\n\ntwenty-five A D that that principle really took on different dimension\n\n\nit´s a sort of three in one and a one in three\n That is the trinity embodying himself into that one physical person\n\nand that one physical person is capable of the divisibility into the\n\nrepresentative of the father<,> he himself trodding as a son and then within\n\n   that holy spirit that we tend to see\n\nthat highly spirit of Creation that comes within it not really holy ghost we\n\ndon´t like the ghost thing is that spirit which moves within our \n\nI-rits\n So with the trinity the father who forever sitteth in Zion but\n\nwithin different dispensation of time the father chooses to manifest himself\n\non the earth and that is usually done within the form of that human form\n\nwhich we recognize<,>\n Again if you check most major philosophies indeed the one who is\n\nheld in great esteem as the deity you will find that they themselves never\n\nreally set out to start  <- > a a  a religion or as we\n\nprefer to say within the Rastafari tradition a liberty\n We think that the word " liberty" is higher than\n\nreligion\n pattern of\n\nworship<,> uhm a certain type of behavioural pattern within your    worship\n Not that we don\'t have that but we go higher liberty a totality and\n\ntherefore you find most uhm Eastern philosophies are usually    described as a way of life\n What you eat what you wear how you sleep uhm the type of\n\nentertainment you do everything comes within that liberty so it\'s not like a\n\nSunday thing\n you are you\n\nare very holy most holy and Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday uh the\n\nsins    are\n\nexcusable as tend to come out with these religious uhm thinking<,>\n\n\n  the embodiment of that trinity within that\n\nphysical human being\n Uh to some of us here it might seem uhm light but when you check\n\nthe history there was a time when Rome the Catholics under Rome especially\n\n   under the Emperor Justin One the Elder they\n\nmade it their duty to kill anyone who upheld this principle<,>\n They would search out and persecute anyone who in other words\n\nanyone who would have the bravery to identify a god upon the earth they would\n\nsearch you out and execute you and indeed most ones for that principle to\n\nhave survived<,> it had to do with Ethiopia\n Most ones who adhered to that principle took refuge in Ethiopia and\n\nfortunately at the time uhm Rome could not besiege Ethiopia\n Rome was not Ethiopia was much too strong for Rome during that era\n\nof time in other words they would have invaded even Ethiopia at that time to\n\nhave<,> executed anyone who held to that particular principle<,> and\n\ntherefore we are saying even now\n picture the first of the Rasta man them who were\n\nbrought up in court picture a man like  Lennard Howill in nineteen\n\nthirty being brought before the court in Jamaica and saying to the judge\n\n Judge you can say whatever you want saying because when my father\n\nHaile-I Selassie-I is going to judge you<,> he will not be pardoning you so\n\nhere what judge you don\'t better have no mercy upon me now because my father\n\nain\'t gonna have no mercy on you\n Rasta man telling a judge\n\nthat in nineteen thirty<,>\n think that Rasta man was\n\ngoing go home huh<,>\n put out the charge now\n\nwhatever the evidence you think him going go home\n I don\'t hear a no\n\n<$C>  No\n\n<$A>  No\n And that is where the twin pillars of this system always worked\n\n The twin pillars many of our people that\n\nwere brought before the court where the evidence wasn\'t strong enough they\n\nwould send you to Belleview\n\n Sometime it looked too bad so they would send you to Belleview and\n\nthat\'s where most of our brothers ended up\n Many of them there for many years ill-treated mal-treated and their\n\nspirit broken and that was what happened to people like  Lennard\n\nHowill who at the time like I said for you to  overstand how\n\nserious this thing is\n any time a Rasta man walk into court and\n\n dares to say  look judge no no    I\'m\n\nnot taking the oath on the bible    I\n\ndon\'t take my oath according to your King James philosophy or I don\'t\n\nswear according to Jesus et cetera and he wishes<,> to take an oath\n\nwhich is binding on his conscience which is permitted by law he would know he\n\nis subject to great pressures and persecution\n So picture in the nineteen thirty\n out of all of that uhm\n\ncoming down like I said    even long\n\nbefore Christ long before whether we accept the man Christ or not because you\n\nknow there have been numerous uhm philosophies surrounding Christ and so on\n\n   and there have been books which show you that\n\nyou know we had many crucified saviours before Christ but let us take that\n\nera because    there was a man\n\nwho trod who seem to have offended his enemies and therefore was ill-treated\n they have always\n\nhave a difficulty in how do we hail a one as the Almighty and that was what\n\nRastafarians many many Rastafarians came under early persecution for because\n\nit is inconceivable that we should be hailing Haile-I Selassie-I<,,>\n In as it goes on as it manifests more and more and it is\n\nrealized<,> because<,> a lot of these early brethrens who had been\n\nenunciating this faith many of them    it\n\nwas that inborn<,> concept\n we\n\ntend not to say meditative it came out of  I-ditative great heights of\n\nreasoning and thinking<,> and<,> but as we go along<,> as the father rise up\n\na few of us now who read a little wider and so on read a little more we start\n\nto realize that many of what our elders taught us purely from a inborn\n\nconcept that innate love that in fact a lot of these principles apart from\n\nthe fact that they had brought them from Africa and that it had not been\n\nkilled out of us despite the brutalities it was still there\n I give you an example\n group of\n\nus went to England at a Rastafari focus which was being held by the\n\nCommonwealth Institute there and<,> uh one day we were taken on a visit to\n\n   a Ghanaian village the Ghanaians had a village\n\njust  outside of

{'text': "<$A>  Okay thank you very much for that introduction as well as for\n\ninviting me to give you a briefing about tobacco control<,>\n Uhm what I'm going to do is speak for about fifteen to twenty\n\nminutes and then that would give us a equal time of discussion<,>\n Uhm I don't know if we gonna have the light on all the time because\n\nit may interfere with the power point but before we get into the power point\n\nlet me just say that there're over one billion smokers world wide and\n\napproximately ten million of them die each year prematurely because of\n\nsmoking cigarettes<,>\n In Jamaica thirty-six per cent of males that's roughly one in every\n\nthree have ever smoked and about eleven per cent of females<,>\n Now persons who smoke definitely have an increase risk of developing\n\nlung cancer and a variety of other cancers of the ears nose and throat well\n\nthe neck the nose the throat the  bladder the cervix and even other\n\ncancers\n They also run the risk of acute and chronic lung infections\n\nbronchitis emphysema sinusitis pneumonia asthma<,>\n Persons who smoke also have a increase risk of coronary heart\n\ndisease and fatal heart attacks<,> and children who are exposed to cigarette\n\nsmoke also tend to get a higher rate of infections respiratory infections and\n\near infections as well as exacerbations of asthma<,>\n Smoking in pregnancy is a risk to the unborn child to the foetus and\n\nit can result in low birth weight as well as to the new born infant a\n\nincrease risk of sudden infant death as well as respiratory infections\n Second hand smoke that is smoke to which other people are exposed\n\nnot the smoker contains over forty different carcinogens and is harmful to\n\npersons who do not smoke themselves but are exposed to the second hand smoke\n\nand they've done studies in wives of smokers and found that these wives who\n\ndo not smoke themselves but their husbands smoke have a higher risk of cancer\n\nas well as respiratory infections,\n In the high income countries it's estimated that maybe six to\n\nfifteen per cent of all annual health costs are<,> due to the treatment of\n\ntobacco related diseases and we did an estimate of the cost of tobacco\n\nrelated in this in Jamaica the cost of treating it since nineteen eighty and\n\nwe estimate it's a crude estimate but we estimate that the cost is in the\n\nregion of four billion U S dollars since nineteen eighty<,>\n\n\na  a brief presentation giving you an idea of some of the\n\nmeasures that we think are important if we are going to control the problem\n\nof smoking in Jamaica\n We actually have a draft Cabinet submission now that just needs to\n\nbe signed off by our Minister and then it will be submitted to Cabinet for\n\ntheir consideration<,>\n you'll see that uhm well this\n\nwas a headline in the Gleaner in March of this year<,> but in fact most of\n\nour cigarettes in Jamaica are locally produced and we actually grow tobacco\n\nas you would know and you will see that although they say that imports are\n\nincreasing<,> you'll see that the local production is far greater because\n\nthis is in thousands of kilograms as opposed to kilograms so basically we\n\nhave a significant tobacco industry in Jamaica and what that article was\n\npointing out is that in fact in some of the tourist areas there were imported\n\ncigarettes coming in that were being smuggled into the island and therefore\n\ntax was not being paid on them<,>\n Now we have instituted certain tobacco control measures in Jamaica\n Since nineteen ninety-five there has been a ban on smoking in all\n\nhealth facilities<,> we have an agreement with the tobacco producers to put a\n\nwarning on the cigarette box uhm advertising on radio and television is\n\nprohibited by agreement<,>\n We have a ban on smoking on Air Jamaica and in the international\n\nairports some private companies have restricted smoking in their facilities\n\nand some insurance companies have preferential premiums for non- smokers<,,>\n Alright this was a visual that uhm did not come up\n I don't know why I lost it and the next one I think I also lost but\n\nyou can go to\n This was a hand out in one of the daily newspapers so although they\n\nagreed not to advertise in relation to radio and television<,> what they have\n\ndone is in fact targeted young people and uh tried to associate smoking with\n\nbeing young and enjoyment and that sort of thing and this is an example of\n\nthe targeting of young people by our tobacco industry and we are aware that\n\nin fact they have gone to night clubs and other events and hand out free\n\ncigarettes\n Now the significance of that is that most people smoke or continue\n\nto smoke because of the nicotine in cigarettes\n Nicotine is one of the most addictive products perhaps after heroin\n\nand cocaine and what happens is that people are attracted to smoking and\n\nafter a few cigarettes some of them become addicted to the nicotine and even\n\nwhen they want to give up smoking they have a difficulty a serious difficulty\n\nbecause of the addiction\n I don't know how many of you remember this lady her name is\n\nDivine<,> you remember her\n right this is a shot\n\nfrom Esquire magazine my British movie star he wanted a beautiful black woman\n\nand this is a cigar not what you may have been thinking about<,> but you can\n\nsee that the immediately there are  this is just a\n\nillustration of how astute they are with their advertising campaign and that\n\nthey target it<,>\n Now tobacco control measures take two forms basically\n One is we have to find ways of discouraging new smokers taking up\n\nthe habit and becoming addicted and we have to help current smokers to quit\n The way we help current smokers to quit is to make smoking more\n\nexpensive<,> that means increasing taxes on cigarettes\n We find that a doctor's advice to the smoker is important it does\n\nhelp\n Nicotine replacement therapy like a nicotine patch or a nicotine\n\ngum is important once the person has decided to give up smoking\n If they have not decided to give up smoking it does not really make\n\na different\n Supportive counselling very important and then having smoke-free\n\npublic places and work sites means that when the smoker gets an urge to smoke\n\nif he's in a situation where he really cannot smoke then it helps him to\n\nresist the urge to smoke\n So these are the measures to help people to stop smoking\n Now if we look at how we uhm prevent people from smoking then we\n\nalso have to look at making cigarettes more expensive\n So we're proposing to Cabinet that they review the taxation policy\n\n\nthe  a national health fond in which they would put on a levy\n\nof one dollar to every cigarette and to every alcoholic drink<,>\n So that is already I think accepted but we may want to review the\n\ntaxation policy overall<,>\n but you\n\nhave to also address the problem of smuggling and many people in Jamaica may\n\nnot realize that in fact cigarettes are smuggled into Jamaica\n This was a big problem in Canada when they increased the tax on\n\ncigarettes there and the tobacco lobby put on a big lobbying exercise to the\n\ndifferent Canadian provinces and some of them relented and reduced the tax\n\nand what they have found is that those provinces in Canada that did not\n\nreduce the tax consumption of cigarettes did decline slightly over the period\n Where they relented and reversed the tax tobacco consumption did\n\nnot decline\n The situation I don't think is as bad now because there is not as\n\nbig a disparity in the taxes between the U S and Canada so I think it's less\n\nof a problem there but when we had the workshop in Kingston there was a\n\nregional workshop to prepare for a international meeting looking at the\n\nframework convention for tobacco control and my presentation was carried in\n\nthe media the tobacco company wrote immediately to the Ministry of Finance\n\narguing against any form of additional taxation<,,>\n these are the tobacco control measures\n Certain tobacco control measures have been shown to be effective\n\ninternationally and others are not effective and some of those that you\n\nbelieve may be effective like educating children on their own are not\n\nsufficient to prevent those same children when they become teenagers smoking\n You have to have certain other measures and those that have been\n\nshown to be  infective included increase taxation the ban on smoking\n\ntobacco products and the broader the ban that you can make the better\n You have to have smoke-free facilities so we're proposing health\n\nfacilities including pharmacies government building's public transport\n\ncinemas airports sports facilities  <- > all the  all of\n\nthose should be and that we should restrict smoking of tobacco products to\n\ndesignated areas in public facilities such as restaurants bars clubs\n\nrecreational facilities\n We're now reviewing this because recent work in California and\n\nelsewhere has shown that restricting smoking areas in restaurants does not\n\nreally work effectively because most restaurants are too small and even if\n\nthey're not small even if they're big the smoke travels from the smoking area\n\nto the non-smoking area\n So we are proposing that for restaurants that smoking be banned\n\nentirely\n The third measure that has been shown to be effective in reducing\n\nsmoking is prohibiting advertising and promotion of tobacco products in any\n\nform electronic newspapers billboards<,> posters pamphlets flyers and we're\n\nalso adding internet websites developed in Jamaica\n We're going for a comprehensive ban on advertising clearly the\n\ntobacco people are going to oppose this<,,>\n We're also going to propose the prohibition of distribution of\n\nsamples of cigarettes or any posters pamphlets or point of sale material\n In some of the supermarkets now just within the last few months\n\nthey have put up massive point of sale promotional dispensers just where you\n\nare checking out<,>\n So this is why they are willing to agree with us that they won't go\n\non the electronic media knowing that if they have their other promotional\n\nopportunities they can get the cigarettes to the young people<,>\n Uhm we would also like to propose that any form of direct\n\nsponsorship of sporting and other events be banned<,>\n Now this one is perhaps the most sensitive of all\n In the letter that the tobacco company wrote to the Minister of\n\nFinance with a copy to the Minister of Health I think they claimed that they\n\ngive as much as ten million dollars to sporting events a year<,> right but\n\nthey do that with a purpose in mind\n So what we're saying is that over a few years we need to phase it\n\nout and    find ways to help the sporting\n\nfraternity and associations to find other forms of sponsorship\n The reason why they give so generously is because they have such\n\nlarge profit margins and because it is in their interest to be associated\n\nwith healthy behaviour with sports idols and also to reach young people and\n\npeople who are watching sports<,>\n We're also looking at the question of prohibiting tobacco products\n\nto minors<,>\n Now this could be a sensitive issue because every big man sends out\n\nsome young child to go and get a cigarette for him and in any shop up and\n\ndown Jamaica you will find children coming in asking for two cigarettes or\n\nfour cigarettes\n conditioned into a\n\nbehaviour which seems as if it's quite normal to smoke\n Their father used to smoke their uncle used to smoke they used to\n\ngo and buy cigarettes for them", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5d564a5e-6b3f-4bd6-9a26-f3e8b855f6a2', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:52.367696+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': "<$A>  Thank you ma'am\n\n trust that this is first of all a very\n\ninformal form uhm and I thank  the G I S for the opportunity to<,>\n\nspeak with you this morning in that vein about the health sector uhm although\n\nmy specific brief related to the recent U N conference on AIDS and clearly\n\nthe impact of the recent events in the Western section of Kingston on the\n\nhealth sector<,>\n\n\ntogether that's been allotted to kind of just give\n\nyou a<,> broad outline of what the health sector uhm is doing some of the\n\nchallenges we face et cetera<,>\n\n has had the most\n\nsignificant impact on Africa in centuries<,>\n It has reduced the life expectancy in Sub Sahara and Africa for\n\nexample from in the high sixties to fifty-two years old\n That is the average life expectancy in Sub Sahara and Africa\n\ntoday<,>\n\n It is a pandemic by that I mean that it is not limited by\n\nboundaries<,> either geographic social or religious<,>\n\n\n It is a disease transmitted where there's an exchange of bodily\n\nfluids for whatever reason<,>\n In Jamaica for example some sixty- seven to seventy per cent of the\n\ntransmission is by heterosexual relationships<,,>\n\n\nin terms of the rate of contraction of the disease with some Caribbean states\n\nexhibiting figures close to four to five per cent of the population being\n\ninfected<,>\n You have countries where like Haiti Trinidad and Tobago that are\n\nabove all contraction rates where the estimate in Jamaica is some one to two\n\nper cent of our population<,>\n our developmental\n\n gains\n\n\nquite obliviously<,> uhm but it has the potential to destroy\n\nour developmental  gains\n and that means\n\nyour working population and this is why the impact is so tremendous in Africa\n\nbecause you're dealing with people who are basically the core of your work\n\nforce<,,>\n Our great worry in Jamaica now is the rate of contraction in our\n\nadolescent females in particular<,,>\n It is demonstrating to us that indeed we're having a problem which\n\nwe I think recognized before of older men having sex with younger women<,>\n we've had made some measure of success in managing the\n\ndisease and also we  had indicate that ninety-five or more per cent of\n\nthe population are fully aware of what causes the disease and how to prevent\n\nit<,> and we've seen successes in our management of the contraction rate\n\nparticularly when you look at some  corollary figures in relation to\n\nthe rate of contraction of congenital syphilis<,> and the fact that condom\n\nprevalence use has risen significantly<,,>\n Indeed we have managed based on the projections from the last\n\nmedium term plan to keep the contraction rates at<,> below what was\n\nprojected<,,> but there are very worrying signs when we look at<,,> the rate\n\nof women presenting at maternal and child health clinics pregnant women<,>\n\nthe rate of H I V infection among pregnant women<,>\n and against the background that\n\nrecognizing the pandemic<,> the United Nations set up a special agency United\n\nNations AIDS U N AIDS<,> separate and apart from the World Health\n\nOrganization to respond to this pandemic as I indicated<,> and the<,> major\n\nconcern<,> of the developing world has been the fact that one there has been\n\nvery slow progress in relation to the<,> search for a vaccine or    other prevention\n\nmethodologies<,,> two that in relation to the treatment of H I V AIDS\n\npatients<,,> the W T O rules and the patent rights intellectual property\n\nrights situation<,> has made the cost of the drugs<,,> impossible for most of\n\nthe people in the  <- > developed world  developing\n\nworld<,,>\n that is the\n\nthird factor<,> that although there's been significant progress in some\n\ncountries<,> that the disease marches on and how do you<,> so to speak get a\n\nforum where best practices around the world can be looked at and duplicated\n\n   in different areas\n\n\n Firstly to ensure that the Caribbean was fully represented in any\n\ndeclaration that came out of the conference and just not in the declaration\n\nbut that recognition was given to the fact that we are<,> the second<,>\n\nregion in terms of the contraction because the problem is so bad in Sub\n\nSahara and Africa that it tended to swamp out everybody else\n So we wanted to ensure that the Caribbean was heard and was fully\n\nrepresented<,,>\n was the proposition by the\n\nsecretary general for the establishment of a U N fund for the fight against\n\nAIDS<,>\n We wanted to ensure that we also were represented in how that fund\n\nwas structured<,> with the objective that clearly it should not be another\n\nbureaucracy international bureaucracy that swallowed up in administrative \n\n<- > expenses  expenses uhm a large portion of these funds\n\nthat are supposed to go out there and to fight and two that there was equity\n\nin the distribution of the funds and three in relation to the fund that the\n\nfund had a kind of flexibility that allowed countries   \n\nto<,> assist their own solutions in other words not to have these\n\nsolutions imposed on us as conditionalities in accessing and using the funds\n\nbut that it gave enough flexibility to your own response to the disease\n\nprocess<,,>\n That covers the second area of our purpose and the third purpose\n\nwas to address this whole question of the negotiations with the\n\npharmaceutical companies with respect to the patents rights<,,>\n\n\nhave gained positions which<,>  have been quite successful in\n\nterms of<,> in court breaching the W T O rules by having firms within their\n\nborders manufacture the<,> cocktails    the\n\nanti-retroviral drugs uhm<,> locally  <- > and at   and\n\nat greatly reduced costs\n Uh some twenty-odd pharmaceutical companies took South Africa to\n\ncourt in their courts for infringement of rights<,> but withdrew the case I\n\nthink largely because of public pressure<,>\n\n\nhas obtained\n But U N AIDS has been very active in assisting countries in\n\nnegotiating with the  pharmaceutical companies<,,> rates for a cost\n\nthat are reasonable to countries<,> but there is a trap because they want to\n\nnegotiate with individual countries<,> and that has resulted in some\n\nstartling disparities one of which was that Sub Sahara and Africa got\n\nsignificant reductions they're about somewhere in the region of five six\n\nhundred dollars a year per patient treatment\n but Chile is\n\ncheaper has negotiated a lower rate despite the fact that Chile in terms of\n\nits economic and  <- >   by any economic\n\nmeasurement uhm has    a great\n\naffordability level and in the Caribbean we have been insisting that they\n\nwould negotiate with us as a body<,>\n Caribbean\n\nstates and agreed that  Caric in Trinidad would together with some of\n\nthe technical people from Jamaica Trinidad Bahamas Barbados<,> Haiti and we\n\nput Haiti in the mix for obvious reasons<,,> that they would get together and\n\ndetermine a list of anti-retrovirals that are applicable to the strains that\n\nwe have in the Caribbean because    it's not\n\njust one strain of the virus that operates and there may be different\n\nstrains in different countries<,>\n of\n\nof of  of drugs that would comprise particular cocktails that\n\nare effective<,> and also that we would look at testing mechanisms including\n\nwhat reagents et cetera we would need and seek to having settled the\n\ntechnical aspects in about the middle towards the end of July having a\n\nmeeting of the Caribbean ministers<,> of those countries mentioned and by the\n\nway the O E C S is included in there<,> uhm having a meeting of the ministers\n\ntogether with the pharmaceutical companies that produce these drugs<,> in an\n\nattempt to negotiate prices that are reasonable\n I might also point out to you that we have had offers already in\n\nthe Caribbean<,> through initiatives led by Minister  Goddard in \n\n  Barbados from most of the major companies of\n\nsome price reductions\n We think that we can do better than those and it is why we're\n\nseeking to pull together as a region as opposed to negotiating\n\nindividually<,> but we also have new entrance into the pharmaceutical<,> let\n\nme put it not new entrance in the sense of to the pharmaceutical industry but\n\nnew entrance to the Caribbean market in pharmaceuticals\n Indian companies for example Zip Lock is one who have indicated an\n\ninterest in supplying uhm  <- > <,> \n\nanti-retrovirals at rates which I think would be most attractive\n\nindeed and we hope to conclude our negotiations with these pharmaceutical\n\ncompanies certainly somewhere around October so as to be able to<,> allow on\n\nthe market in the Caribbean drugs for the treatment of AIDS that will be in\n\nour view affordable<,,>\n\n Part of the stigma relating to H I V AIDS is that this is an\n\nincurable disease<,,> apart from the fact of course that there is a general\n\nfeeling that you get what you deserve right<,> uhm and this is a carry-over\n\ntoo from the fact that    it was thought of as \n\n  a homosexual disease<,,>\n H I V AIDS treatment has proven that you can live for fifteen\n\ntwenty years a reasonable<,> good quality of life<,>\n We think that if there is that possibility and it seems to have\n\nworked in the countries that have adopted treatment modalities<,> that more\n\npeople who in fact have the disease will come out receive treatment and be\n\nmore responsible about their behaviour<,> because there isn't the fatalism\n\nattached to the fact of having the disease<,>\n standpoint widen what is now our\n\npilot project dealing with<,> pregnant women<,> and go to<,> testing\n\n\nall pregnant women compulsorily are tested<,> compulsorily<,> are tested<,>\n\nfor H I V AIDS<,> uhm because<,> the prevention of transmission mother to\n\nchild transmission is well within our region is now being carried out in that\n\npilot area\n you know\n\naffordable and<,> it prevents the transmission and with   \n\nother precautions like supplementary feeding as opposed to breast\n\nfeeding<,> the baby will survive free of AIDS<,> but in the context of<,> our\n\nsociety we then feel that    interrupting the mother to child transmission you\n\nmust treat mother otherwise you're going to have an orphan very often on your\n\nhands\n So as a priority from a government point of view in terms of\n\nconsideration being given

{'text': "<$A>  Alright\n First of all let me welcome you to the Jamaican Conference Centre\n\nand just to say that the Conference Centre was built in nineteen\n\neighty-two<,> and officially opened by Queen Elizabeth<,> \n\n nineteen<,> eighty-three February\n This area here is our lobby area entry hall and when we do have\n\nlarge conferences we use the counter area here for  \n\nregistration\n\n\nairline from the bank from the post office so that participants do\n\nnot have to leave the Centre to go on the road all these facilities are\n\navailable right here\n The Conference Centre was built to house the International Seabed\n\nAuthority's meeting and the conference rooms are designed to United Nations\n\nspecifications\n lobby area if you look up you will see\n\nsome baskets\n so\n\nyou realise that there's not an echo<,> when we're walking\n\nthrough<,>\n The Centre has five conference rooms and three corpus rooms and\n\nwe're gonna take a look at one of each<,>\n\n That's it right now\n\n okay this is corpus room number three\n All the corpus rooms are set like this\n the\n\nair-conditioning system the duct ones are through  , \n\nthe wooden structure here and again this is also for\n\nacoustics<,><,,> and aesthetics A lot of the material or I\n\nshould say all of the material used<,> in the building of the Conference\n\nCentre are local\n\n It's just the design that's by the United Nations specification\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  who uhm\n\nwas responsible for designing the Centre\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  it is\n Urban Development\n\nCorporation<,> and uhm    he now has\n\nhis own private company<,,>\n\n As we walk along the tiles also these tiles came from a company in\n\nSaint Elizabeth no longer open unfortunately  , \n\n Now we are standing in conference room number four\n are very similar\n mirrors number five and we have a collapsible wall\n\nhere<,> which we can convertnumbers four and five\n\ninto one<,>\n As is conference room number four can accommodate up to one\n\nhundred and fifty persons<,> but we can go up to two hundred with additional\n\nchairs<,>\n All the conference rooms all five conference rooms have a seven\n\nlanguage interpretation<,>\n and if you look\n\nalso<,> at the desk themselves<,> the participants<,> here<,> you have\n\noutlets for the earphones<,> so that they can hear what's\n\nhappening in terms of the language interpretation and also the facility we\n\nhave of microphones on the desk which is another plus<,>\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A> \n\n, go to\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n understood\n\nduring question period\n\n<$A>  Exactly\n because it's one microphone you\n\nhave to walk up to a microphone\n you have them on a desk\n Again the use of local material\n which are used here as lampshades around\n\n <- > the<,>  the lighting fixture\n\n\nroof\n design\n\nthe roofs in this way to  have warehouse effect\n before the Conference Centre was built there was an old\n\nwarehouse on the site<,> so they decided to keep that<,> as\n\nis<,>\n\n\nat the side\n Local material and it's again decorative\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  Well in terms of types of events that we have here at the\n\nCentre we have local organisation and international organisation\n public and private sector\n\norganisations<,>\n\n As I mentioned before number five mirrors number\n\nfour<,>\n So it's almost identical and the interpretation facilities we have\n\nhere also<,> for this conference room<,,>\n and\n\nthose are conference rooms number   one and \n\ntwo<,,>\n\n\n brass design\n This was done by one of our local persons again\n Fitz\n\nHarrock he did all this<,> and in the design depicts the\n\ntheme of the Centre which is the ocean\n you can\n\ninterpret what we are seeing here and it is uhm the bronze metal<,>\n This conference room can accommodate up to four hundred persons\n\n Again in terms of design a lot of local material\n We have bricks on the wall\n and\n\nthese are used here again for    a different look<,>\n This room is also equipped with seven language interpretation\n\nfacilities<,> and it opens up onto the harbour lounge if you will look at it\n\nin a little while<,> and that area is   often \n\nused for  <,>  coffee\n\nbreaks<,> or cocktail parties<,>\n one and two is\n\nthat we have small back office space where uhm organisations or persons\n\nhosting meetings can set up their  <- >  \n\nsecretarials sorry uhm<,> by that section<,,>\n This was number two\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A> \n We'll just have a look at the harbour longue before we go to\n\nnumber one<,,>\n Another of the facilities that we offer is that we have as you\n\nwalk along you see we have a lot of<,> telephone bouncer phone\n you use the\n\npublic phones or if they wish to use the facilities that we offer<,> they can\n\nalso use that\n\n\n This is where when you want to unwind and you're in a meeting the\n\nwhole day you get  it's a little bit boring you come around by this\n\nsection because it sits right on the harbour\n This is the Kingston Harbour that we are looking at here\n The seventh largest in the world\n Seventh largest natural harbour in the world\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n And the harbour lounge all stretches from the back of conference\n\nroom number two to the back of conference room number one<,>\n use of local material\n This was done by Norma Harrock\n that were\n\ndone as little coffee<,> or side tables<,> and also the mahogany again the\n\npottery<,,>local craftsmen did all of that\n In terms of how this is designed the glass that you find is a\n\nquarter inch thick and it was specifically done this way<,> to withstand the\n\npressure of the wind coming in from the ocean<,>\n\n\n nothing happened\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n Nothing\n\n\n<$A>  Nothing happened\n\n Not a major thing\n\n As we walk along also you'll find the artwork on the wall local\n\nagain\n There's a company uhm I'm sure they're still around Things\n\nJamaica<,> and they did a lot of  <,> \n\nthe work here\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n Mhm\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A> \n This is conference room number one our largest\n\n\nbut with additional chairs we can go up to about twelve hundred<,>\n Again this room also has the seven language interpretation\n\nfacility\n rooms\n\nfor example when we have large groups political groups coming in<,> uhm \n\n  staff association credit unions they use\n\nthis a lot because of the number of persons<,>\n How the room is designed again is pretty unique where you have\n\nthe balconies<,> seating balconies on both the sides here accommodating\n\npersons and then we have    the foreground<,,>\n Use of local material again for aesthetics and acoustics and for\n\nlighting because those baskets along the glass there<,> they\n\nblock out the light<,>\n So in terms of audiovisual presentation the room is not too\n\nbright<,,>\n Conference room number one also has behind it some suite of\n\noffices which are used for secretariat<,>\n\n\nInternational Seabed Authority each year they host one of their meetings here\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  It's not what right cos built originally for them but they\n\ncome every year\n was\n\nlike you would have them in Jamaica more often<,> but that didn't work out\n\nbut we still have them once per year<,> and    they\n\nuse pretty much all the rooms when they come here<,>\n But this is one of the main main rooms that are used\n there's a stage\n\nthat can be attached<,> to the bottom there<,> so\n\ndepending on what the client's request is<,> we can have a   flat\n\nstage or we can have a raised podium with uh head table<,>   so\n\nthat depending\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\nceremonies\n\n<$A>  for awards ceremonies or uhm\n\ntheatrical performances and so on<,> it would be good to use a stage at that\n\ntime<,> for those purposes\n it opens up to the harbour\n\nlounge<,>\n\n And we've been having quite a few graduations I must point\n\nout<,>\n the conference room\n\nnumber  conference room number one<,> for their prize-giving\n\nceremonies<,> and graduations<,><,,>\n Now in addition to a conference room we have areas for dining and\n\nalso exhibition\n What we have down here is what is referred to as our garden area\n\nA and B\n\n\n  a lot of these posts<,> uhm carvings<,> fish\n\ndepicting again the theme of the ocean which is the Conference Centre\n\n\nand<,,> it gives you the feeling    of not\n\nbeing   at   a conference<,>\n\nyou know\n Uh uh having been in the meeting room for the entire day one can\n\ncome outside here now and  eat<,> right by the open\n\ngarden area<,>\n\n\n\n private\n\nair-conditioned dining area<,>\n Right here's our conversation piece which is a collection of\n\nshells<,,>\n\n\n\nto have   to dine in a private area<,>\n This is also used for wedding receptions\n Persons who want to have special awards lunches or dinners they\n\nuse this area or what is all<,> one of the other good things in terms of the\n\nd<*>e- acute</*>cor is that you're in a room but you're still\n\nlooking<,> outside at nature\n and you're looking at the\n\ngarden at the other side so it doesn't give you this feeling as if you're so\n\nenclosed<,,>    in you know you're in\n\nsuch    an enclosed setting\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n Yeah\n\n\n<$A> \n when it's decorated fabulous\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  Now I wanna take you upstairs\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  This is our cafeteria area\n This is also a design United Nations specifications so it's a\n\nwalk through tray pick up, and it's open to the public Mondays to Friday\n\nwhen the conference centre is open\n However if we have very large groups in house this is closed to\n\nthe public because we use this area<,> for dining\n\n<$Z> \n\n by my\n\ncolleagues\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nword</unclear>\n\n<$A>  you can probably pick\n\nup in a little while<,>\n\n<$A> \n This is our exhibition gallery\n cos we have\n\nthe spotlights already in<,> electrical outlets along the\n\nside<,>\n The persons who are hosting events they want to have an\n\nexhibition will use this area<,> and the  booths are\n\ntaken and tabled and so on to set up the area itself<,>\n\n<$Z> \n Yeah\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z>", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '3a906510-e48c-4fe1-9f3d-6693ee63d993',

multimedia equipment\n machines can be used for sound stuff\n\nand\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Well right now all the new machines that are here uhm they\n\ncame equipped with sound card on Word<,> so if you

It's the one of choice\n you know in the earlier years or not so early\n\nbut you know we uhm  a little bit back Netscape was the one of\n\nchoice you know\n think but\n\nthen explorer came up and went beyondBut there are few people who prefer\n\nNetscape\n You know we can lose people for a Netscape so I know we can't\n\nkeep up with them as well\n A good browser on a machine\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n don't use uhm Word\n\nexcept for in the office I use Word Perfect\n\n\n<$A> \n Can't handle\n\n<$Z> \n And the whole system how they try to ruin Netscape\n and I thought you know I'm going\n\nto

\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\ninterruption-of-tape\n\n<$A>  I'm not sure who is really in charge of that uhm all I know\n\nis that    you know if a hurricane is coming it will\n\nbe the department's responsibility

for my director who is out of office today\n\nand<,> our division the natural history division is actually the oldest\n\ndivision in the institute several hundred years old and uhm our main mission\n\nis to stimulate interest in Jamaicans and visitors in Jamaican plants and\n\nanimals\n Our main functions include the museum or scientific collections of\n\nplants and animals uh public  educators on the environment \n\nassaminatals of scientific information and promoters of conservation of\n\nthe natural environment\n And more recently uh we have become promoters of scientific and\n\ntechnical cooperation concerning biological diversity\n And we have five units that carry out all of that work this is our\n\nzoology unit our botany unit our science library unit our<,> public\n\neducational outreach unit and the Biodiversity Information Network\n\nunitWhich is also known as the Jamaica clearing house\n\nmechanism<,>\n So that's it\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\nuh educating people   within that regard\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Ok\n Alright I am Byron uhm and I am the information network manager\n Today I'm sitting in for Mister Aarons our\n\ndirector<,>\n Alright well the National Library well as the name implies it is\n\nthe national library of Jamaica\n It is a statutory organisation it has legal force and it has a\n\nspecified mission which is to<,> document and collect and make available all\n\nJamaican materials broadly defined Jamaican information bearing material\n And now that includes things like audiovisual and electronic\n\npublication as well as the traditional books and pamphlets and those type of\n\nmaterial\n Jamaican is defined broadly anything that has a Jamaican\n\nimprint<,> anything that is about Jamaica or anything written by\n\na Jamaican whether   abroad or local\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n So you don't only uhm collect those things published on the island\n\nbut uh everything dealing   with matters concerning  \n\nthe island\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n\nconcern so it is an ongoing situations and there are hurdles but    we have a<,> good dedicated staff that is geared at\n\nachieving this is a multi-facetted sort of things so  things as noted\n\nuhm into information technology and that's a large part of it today\n But there are more traditional things we have a research arm we\n\nhave one of our more interesting sections that how we look at this morning\n\nour  bindary  our  we're conservation \n\nstrategies/instructives<,> we have audiovisual departments\n\nand we have the traditional administrative situations in libraries\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n Mhm\n\n\n<$B>  Okay\n Alright alright\n\n<$C>  William Duffus uhm senior library assistant\n standing in for uhm Miss Celestine Thomas\n\nwho is the director of the Junior Centre\n sixty-one years and uhm\n\nwas the first    public lending library in Jamaica\n eighteen and uhm\n\nwe  <- >   have a library which we<,> have\n\nopened to the kids on a daily basis\n\n\nmusic speech drama<,> creative crafts drummings and uh needle craft\n summer workshop a duration of four\n\nweeks which usually proves very interesting for   \n\nthe kids at that time\n We're also involved in a outreach programmes uh for school groups\n\nyouth groups\n</} visits\n\nyou know<,> to the centre<,> and we try to<,> do our best in\n\nstimulating you know the interests of the children in a creative way\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n a\n\nlending library but a really a cultural centre for      when the Junior Centre was formed but in nineteen \n\n<- > sixty-five  sixty-one we moved out of Kingston because\n\n  the government thought it was important  \n\nto spread the culture a little and in sixty-five again we got another\n\nspace and we been growing like that now we're trying to go to Montego Bay and\n\nwe'll have a little museum showing not only uhm ethnography and history which\n\nI deal with but uhm natural history   and Junior Centres\n\nwe're hoping throughout Jamaica   someday I'm not sure\n\nit\n\n<$A> \n\n<$?male> \n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n for the rest of the Jamaicans who cannot make the trip to\n\nKingston   all the time\n But I think if you're trying to reach the visitors uh the north\n\ncoast is   definitely the place to go because  \n\n that's   where most of them\n\n<$E> \n\n<$E> \n\n<$E>  well one of the\n\nthings because    we are    like in Europe uh mueums find themselves in spaces and\n\nthen after that    the space develops   in\n\nsome way helps that\n We're hoping that we'll be the catalyst for the development or\n\nredevelopment of the downtown area because it has been and has a glorious\n\nhistory but has been in a state of disrepair for some time\n So we're hoping that but notwithstanding we're in Montego Bay and\n\nhopefully we'll open a museum there and in other capitals   \n\nto offer centres for people as in my division really reflection \n\n  and research  <- > and  and history\n\nand preservation\n that\n\nyou know  that you know these things are important\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n this past\n\nweekend then when  or past week<,> when everybody\n\nwas uh more or less institutionalised and<,> uh trying  \n\nto you know get into aspects of history and culture\n\n<$E> \n\n<$E> \n\n<$E> \n\n<$E> \n\n I thought  <- >   about six months\n\nago that I had my worst weekend but it continues every\n\nweek\n hurdle\n\nto cross so in that regard    it has been\n\ninteresting this month because the month<,> is our \n\nheritage month<,> and with that people are definitely\n\nsensitised<,>    to heritage and its\n\npreservation\n And so we and I'm sure all the divisions have people\n\ncalling<,> everyday because they want to know something else and\n\nwe should one of the things we've started is not only the outreach which\n\nstarted some fifty years ago\n set up\n\nlittle exhibitions for them\n So every school now wants an exhibition and every school calls\n\neveryday we have a you know rostered out to do something for them\n demand in that regard is\n\ntherefore  <- > a  a object sectoreduhm\n We have preservation\n\n\nwe  when we walk around then we'll know more about the\n\ndivision\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$Z>

in Jamaica\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$F> \n Two reasons mainly one because that is overall fear for snakes\n\nand when  di</> someone see the person don't want to do is chop it up or\n\nstone it to death and because of the mongoose which is an introduced species\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$F>  They eat them yes\n lovely animal and it's\n\nonly found in Jamaica   <unclear> word(s)</unclear>\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$F>  It looks impressive\n eaters cos a lot of people in\n\nJamaica they've never come so close<,> to a live snake more so \n\nthey get used to like them like small garden snakes\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$F>  Move you on to this quick tour\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$F>  cos some of them the only\n\ntime they see things like this is on T V<,> over here   you must know it  these are owls right\n like\n\nalmost other country in the world\n owl\n But this is our special owl it's called the brown\n\nowl<,> or  patoo as they call it here \n\npatoo\n Okay\n Only found in Jamaica nowhere else in the world and uhm there\n\nthis myth to it<,> that if a  patoo flies over\n\nyour house<,> right somebody's going to die   or\n\nsomebody's going to get pregnant\n\n You're going to die and that's one

just thought\n\nthat<,> ah\n\n<$F>  Let me show you another interesting one\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n\n<$F> \n\nmyth about this one is it has this red thing like on a <unclear>\n\nseveral-words</unclear> right here  directly\n That a myth that how it got it has actually under the cross where\n\nJesus was crucified and a drop of his blood dripped on it\n And there's another story that said when if you die in

know it normally goes in the pamphlet boxes upstairs\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$G>  stilling\n\nwith punish and still running have to service it regular\n know but nobody has to come in and work on it\n\nso which is good \n You know this is a scroll from somebody's collection that came in\n\nnow I just to do some work on it\n\n\nthem/him<,> and they got broken up in pieces<,>\n\nso what is actually doing is us    putting it\n\nback together straightening the sections that were torn  \n\nand and is gonna fill out you know the sections here   that are\n\nmissing   <unclear> words</unclear>\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n to the private collection or\n\nwill that be part of\n\n<$G>  The library\n No I think this is private collection I think probably what they\n\ndo is probably microfilm it upstairs which is what they normally\n\ndo<,>\n They get that copy of it and then they send it back to the owners\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$G>  Well what you use a

is much easier to move and  find out<,>\n Normally do it under lighting but I'm using one inside here know\n\nhow  to do it\n He doesn't want to use the other one because this much bigger\n\nthan a

\n\n\n<$G>  And this is another uhm set of old newspapers\n years ago uhm it's from nineteen\n\nsixty-nine from somebody's personal collection\n Apparently he had these and he want them to restored it so we're\n\njust repairing them<,> put locks in them and if you're doing \n\ndehydrafication process then but the paper is not the best quality cos\n\n  newspapers\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n yeah I know all about\n\nthat\n\n\nit's a mess<,> because you all see through  \n\nwhat the other side has and the typeset isn't even and oh<,> yes\n\nyeah\n\n<$G> \n\n<$G> \n\n<$G>  The colour\n\n\n<$G> \n\n<$G>  So just trying to repair this and put it back together\n We don't know aren't sure how he wants it cos he have this\n\nsection and there's another section which is much bigger which is actually a\n\ntotally different size\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$G> So this side is actually the bigger one\n\nwhich is the idio<unclear>word</unclear> which he has this set and that set\n\nand I don't know if he wants it  both together or I'll probably do\n\nthem separate\n not a full Gleaner it's just this is all it\n\nis\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$G> Just that\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$G>  A few pieces\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$G>  You know so we wanna use and put everything together this\n\nwith that one\n If he wants it that way and then put it in a book form so it can\n\nkeep it or register it and sell it to a <unclear> word</unclear>\n\nand you know\n the\n\ngasification process\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$G>  Yes we do\n\n<$Z> \n\n\nobviously is\n\n<$G>  what\n\nthe schools yes\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$G>  collections\n that's\n\nstrange that leave it\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n give a dump\n\nof things more   yeah yeah yeah<,>\n\n Well thank you for showing me around\n here rushing me along\n\nand    it's for my own best

Uhm actually it was museum's first\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$E?> \n Yeah we're running badly back in time\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$E>  something that\n\neverybody has expressed to me\n Is very very difficult to do these uh whirl wind tours\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$E>  There's so much\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n\n<$E> \n\n<$E>  how are you doing\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$E> \n Can you call Mister Modest for me\n\nplease<,,>\n This is the headquarters of the museum's division\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$E>  A'right\n I cannot do what they have\n\nhere and  just as fine but I can tell you that in addition to their\n\nresearch and preservation work they have a display here which is what Mister\n\nModest is gonna tell you about\n This one if you have the time you would have to come back and see\n\nthis one\n It's very fascinating in a sense that it touches on Jamaican uhm\n\nreligion\n\n<$Z> \n Mhm\n looks to me as if it was\n\nsomething to do with Maya or obeah or whatever   of the sort I'm\n\nnot an expert on these religions   I think but uh\n\n<$E> \n\n<$E> \n\n<$E>  What it really focuses on is a religion what we call Revival\n\n<$Z> \n\n Mhm\n\n\n<$E> \n\n<$E> \n\nit is  it is very very authentic and people who have been to\n\nactual Revival yards who have come here and seen it have given very high\n\nmarks for authenticityHello Mister Modest\n\n<$H>  Hello\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$H>  Nice to meet you again\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$E>  but you\n\nknow you know how it   is with these tours\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$Z> \n everybody has a lot to say and I'm interested\n\nin what they say so we get\n\n<$H>  Really I'm happy that you're interested\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$H>  How long are you here then\n\n<$Z> \n Uh this time only two weeks because I have to go back to my\n\nuniversity and teach\n The term has already started but uhm I'll be back at you know\n\nvarious intervals\n\n<$H>  The university's in Munich\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$H>  In Freiburg okay\n Uhm well I'm going to do is uhm to introduce the Museums Division\n\na little and <unclear> word</unclear> to<,> have the <unclear>\n\nword</unclear> who is what I call in charge of popular\n\nculture<,>     \n\nand<,> folk   <unclear> words</unclear> put on

something to tell you\n there was a time when it\n\nwas used for  <- > as  a entirely different purpose and \n\n  the debate at one point it was the question was it a\n\nhostel or was it a novel kind of  L\n\n<$Z>   Mhm\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$E>  Establishment\n\n<$Z> \n Yes I see\n\n\n<$E>  And so as much as Jamaican history is rather\n\ncolourful the history of our own facility here has a bit of\n\ninterest   to it as well \n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$E>  isn't\n\nit\n As you see just the size of the things around you tells you that\n\nthis is really engineered for children\n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$E>  Alright\n Okay Mister Duffus\n\n<$L>  Yes\n\n<$K>  We have finally arrived as you see\n\n<$L> \n\n<$K> \n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$L>  Mhm\n Well\n This is the Junior Centre main\n Well this is a library right\n Incidentally we have another Junior Centre which is in Greater\n\nPortmore Saint Catherine<,> right but this is the parent body so to\n\nspeak\n And this is our library which we incidentally got uhm

that\n\nwhich is a difficult thing    I was saying  on the\n\nradio this morning in developing uhm society cos I think  the dial in\n\nmore museums in these uhm societies is to try to convince people that\n\npreservation is important when they are more concerned about day-to-day\n\nthings like eating and whatever that kind of things\n A'right but we struggle along it\n\n\nthis building you see

there looking on uh the  view\n since the nineteen sixties we've been trying\n\nto spread our work uhm and make it which I think is in keeping with what was\n\nhappening internationally to make

head\n\noffice<,> we administrate from conservation restoration to\n\ndesign and all of    those education programs\n\n so as    these    out stations\n\nare always too small and as such inadequate to really tell the story and to\n\ntell it an interesting and exciting way uhm and that is basically where we\n\ncan do temporary exhibitions also<,>\n One of our newest projects is the Museum of Jamaican Music where\n\nwe well initiated the idea\n\n\ncan  can actually feel through context that kind of context\n\nwe'll display how Jamaican music developed because we here  \n\n and probably I should say I in my tenure will move away from the\n\n   object as object former which\n\nis what I think is    or call an art historian\n\nmethodology to a more contextual format because uhm a lot of

up the\n\nexhibitions and putting up the flags outside there are some flags on \n\n the outside uhm it was interesting to see people who did not want\n\nto come into the building because of them or

{'text': "<$A>  And my name is Annette and this is the home of Sir Noel Coward\n three miles from the\n\nnearest town which is Port Maria<,>\n actor director singer\n\ncomposer\n He also did paintings for his hobby\n He was here in nineteen forty-eight on a vacation with his companion\n\nGraham Payn\n And they were staying at Golden Eye in Oracabessa and that's the\n\nhome of Ian Fleming\n So one afternoon he and his companion they were going for a ride\n They were passing on the main road and saw the track leading off to\n\nhere\n So he wanted to see what was up here\n So they came up\n They went around to the front there\n Immediately he fell in love with the place\n So he started to paint around there\n And he was there painting until it became dark\n He saw the fireflies\n\n So he was so fascinated by them that the next day go about seeking\n\nthe ownership of the property\n Even though he had his first house which was the Blue Harbour but\n\nhe was not satisfied with the construction done on that house\n So he was looking for land elsewhere\n He then found out this one belongs to Blanche Linda Blackwell\n\n He then asked for his holiday retreat house to be built here\n So this one here is started in nineteen forty-eight and this was\n\ncompleted in nineteen fifty-six\n\n<$Z>  And what was built here when he came\n\n\n<$A>  that was\n\nused by the pirate Henry Morgan\n But I'll tell you more as we go along\n this was completed in\n\nnineteen fifty-six\n to six months out of each\n\nyear here<,> until his death in nineteen seventy-three\n So he died leaving this for his companion Graham Payn\n But he did not want to stay here after his death\n So in nineteen seventy-six he leave it to the government of\n\nJamaica\n In nineteen ninety-two it has been leased from them by Island\n\nCommunication which is owned by Chris Blackwell\n So what he is doing now is to restore it back to the days of the\n\nsixties when Sir Noel was here\n So inside the house you will still see his painting studio dining\n\nroom music room bedroom and the room with a view\n So as we go feel free to ask any question\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> people-talking-in-\n\nbackground\n\n<$A>  So here you have his painting studio\n This is where he did most of his paintings and you can see some of\n\nhis painting being displayed over on this side\n Those are some of the books and materials that he used\n\n\nPrivate Lives<,,> unintelligible-speakers-in-\n\nbackground\n that visit\n\nhim\n they visit\n\nhim at the  they visit him here    in the\n\nday\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  Blue Harbour is on the main road\n\n So you have Sofia Loren Sean Connery Elizabeth Taylor Richard\n\nBurton<,> and Maggie Smith<,,>\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A> \n here\n So is his dining area and in nineteen sixty-five the Queen Mother\n\ncame here and had lunch with Sir Noel<,> and these all the same\n\nsetting they used<,>\n These were lent to him these China were lent to him by Blanche\n\nBlackwell<,>\n But as soon as this museum was open she donated them back to the\n\nmuseum<,>\n So on the wall there you see the photo on the day the Queen Mother\n\ncame\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z>  back\n\nthen   like she did when she died\n\n<$A> \n\nlaughsYes<,,>\n This was the music room\n had two\n\ngrand pianos\n The one to the corner there the Beckstein this one at the front is\n\na Chapel and these are some of his actress and friends<,>\n He had two pianos because he could not read or write music\n So while he played he would have somebody writing for\n\nhim<,>\n So that's the reason for both piano\n All the paintings you can see inside here was done by\n\nhim<,>\n And there he had his fireplace\n And you know in Jamaica there are not much houses that you can see\n\na fireplace cos we don't really use fireplace here in Jamaica<,>\n Down below you can see his kitchen\n his meals were prepared at the Blue Harbour\n\nwhich was his first house\n So they just prepare his meal there brought it here you warm it up\n\nin the kitchen\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A> \n And you know Chris Blackwell was the producer of a Bob Marley\n\nrecords   and now he's the manager for Island Communication\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n Yeah\n That is a nice view\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A> \n and you're\n\noverlooking the town of Port Maria\n The island there that's called the Cabarita Island\n On a very clear day you see as far as the Blue Mountain Peak from\n\nhere\n\n swimming pool but\n\nthis was covered by the National Heritage Trust  \n maintain it during all the period that they\n\nhad it here<,> so they covered it<,>\n And here you can see his desk\n Pomp and\n\nCircumstance<,>\n\n Painting on the wall was also done by him\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n\n<$A>  Yes that's a sculpture of his\n\nhead<,><,,>\n\n<$Z>  He got this house for a hundred and fifty\n\npounds\n\n<$A> \n\nproperty<,>\n\n So this was his bedroom here\n And this bed inside here was given to him as a gift on the first\n\nnight he moved in by a friend<,>\n And this is a plantation piece that was done here in\n\nJamaica<,>\n And he likes pineapple which you can see in the centre of the bed\n\nhead<,> which he said signify peace and hospitality  \n on top of the house when you get outside you'll also see\n\npineapple\n In nineteen seventy-three one night he suffered a heart attack in\n\nhis bathroom there and he was heard groaning by the butler who came in\n\nthrough the window found him on the floor helped him to his bed and sent to\n\nBlue Harbour to get help\n But by the time they got here he already died\n Three days later he was buried here on the grounds of Firefly\n So in his changing room here you still see his Hawaiian shirts\n\nsome pyjamas and monogram towels in his bathroom<,,>\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n he lived to be how old\n\n<$A>  He was seventy-four when he\n\ndied<,,>\n\n<$A> Outside here you can see his statue and\n\nthis was placed there in nineteen ninety-nine for his centenary birthday\n from\n\nEngland\n\n<$A> \n And from over here you see his first house the Blue\n\nHarbor<,,>\n Blue Harbour right\n\nthere<,> that white house with the red top there<,>\n So that was his first house and that's where they prepare his\n\nmeals and brought it here to him\n\n the day and by\n\nevening they had to go back to the Blue Harbour\n So that is privately owned now and it is still being used as a\n\nguest house<,,>\n Over here you can see the seventeenth century building\n This was used by pirate Henry Morgan\n He was Sir Henry Morgan because he was knighted by King Charles\n\nthe Second\n So this is where he had his lookout\n off the\n\n  offshore\n his men they would attack\n\nthe boat then he would take up all the belongings here\n So when Sir Noel came he saw this building and he started to\n\npaint around here and when this house was complete he move up into the\n\npainting studio\n\n\n Outside here you can see we have this lawn\n as uhm like weddings\n\nparties and private dinners\n\n\n\n And this was one of his favourite spot\n This is where he had cocktails in the evenings with his friends\n where he\n\ndied<,><,,>\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\nm  found the house here when he bought it or    is the whole garden made\n\n<$A>  No it wasn't\n were more\n\ntrees<,>\n\n So you can see the original structure\n\n The inside you have a fireplace where the pirate would\n\nuse<,,>\n This is the fireplace\n pirate would cook\n\n These are some bones that were found here on the\n\nproperty<,>\n Can be traced back to the days of the Tainos\n and the thickness of this wall\n\nit's two feet thick<,>  ,\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$Z>  Right\n\n\n<$A>  Yes\n So those are

Jerry\n\nMiller on the fifth day of November nineteen ninety- nine in the parish\n\nof St Elizabeth assaulted  Ronald Smith\n To this indictment he has pleaded not guilty and so the burden rests\n\non the Prosecution to satisfy me to the extent where I feel sure that this\n\naccused man is guilty as charged\n This is a gun court offence and therefore the Court would have the\n\njurisdiction to try this matter and in having that jurisdiction the\n\nProsecution has to adduce evidence which satisfies this Court that whatever\n\nis said to have been used by the accused man falls within the provision of\n\nthe Firearm Act\n In other words to give me that jurisdiction issues have been\n\nidentified and I adopt the issues as enunciated by Counsel for the Defence\n\nand the Prosecution that there are issues which concerns credibility and that\n\nor they are very live issues in this case\n Let me go through the evidence of the witnesses as I see it\n\npresented by the Prosecution\n Ronald\n\nSmith who is the complainant in this matter who says that he is a farmer\n\nliving in St Elizabeth and that he remembers the fifth of November nineteen\n\nninety-nine at about eight P M that he was riding his motorcycle coming up\n\naccording to him from Carrisbrook and his pillion passenger was with him on\n\nthat motorcycle\n He tells this Court also that as he was coming up on reaching a\n\ncorner he sees a white car and a motor bike in the road and that the two\n\ndrivers that is for the motorcar and rider for the motor cycle were there\n\ntalking\n According to him the road was blocked so he had to gear down to\n\nstop and when he stopped he saw  Jerry Miller coming from the right\n\nside and coming from this shop\n He said he pulled something from his right pocket while he was\n\nstill sitting on that motor bike which was never shut off\n\n was coming\n\nwith a piece of long stick and hit after the youth who was behind him on the\n\nmotor bike\n that he had to ride away and\n\ngo to Holland Cross then left from there and went back home and then the\n\nfollowing morning he went to the police and made a report at Maggotty\n He tells me also that when he first saw him he was he pointed out\n\nin Court from where he stood to the accused man in the dock and that he could\n\nsee him because of the big public service light that was close by and there\n\nwas also light he said coming from the shop\n\n\nJerry Miller was coming out of the shop when he saw him and the light was\n\nfrom where he stood to the fan in the jury box\n He told you that the man pulled a gun from his right pants pocket\n\nand was pointing the gun at him and speaking to him saying  Pussyhole\n\ndon't move\n In his description of the gun he said it was short and was black in\n\ncolour that he had seen this kind of gun before that he had seen his uncle\n\nwith a gun looking like that one and that he had seen security guards with\n\nguns like that\n He also tells this Court that when he saw this person he knew who\n\nit was as he had seen the person's whole complete body saw his face and\n\naccording to him everything\n He describes how he pointed the gun at him\n He said that this man was stepping off a shop piazza and coming\n\ntowards him and then he took the gun from his pants pocket and pointed it at\n\nhim\n He said he saw the face of this man for about some five minutes and\n\nthat he knew this person for some fifteen years aback and that this person\n\nusually work for him\n He would give him a day on his farm where he was living at Tonky\n\nand he doesn't know if this man has any malicious feelings for him\n Cross-examined he told the Court that he was at this spot where he\n\nstopped for about a minute when the accused man came down with the gun and he\n\nstates that he had come out of the shop\n He said he was afraid when he saw the accused man coming up or\n\ncoming from the shop\n\n\nspeech-continuesHe spoke about how he was positioned as he sat on the\n\nbike with the shop to his right and that he was on the left side of the road\n And that he saw the man who was coming with this piece of stick\n\nthrough his mirror and was about to lick off his passenger and he ride off\n He said he saw the accused man there that night and he wasn't\n\ncoming to this court to tell any lies on him about any feelings\n He speaks about the light on the left side of the road by the J P S\n\nlight pole with the light\n He said he never reach exactly under the light but the car was\n\nparked exactly under the light but he was able nevertheless from the light is\n\nto see where this person is\n And finally he was not making any mischief on this accused man\n the investigating officer\n\nrecall on the sixth of November somewhere about five in the evening he was on\n\nduty at the Maggotty Police Station when he saw  Smith and \n\n<Godwinson \n and\n\nas a result of this report he commenced investigation and had collected\n\nstatements from both men\n for\n\nIllegal Possession of Firearm and Assault at common-law and went to search\n\nfor this man\n Peter\n\nMuffin's shop where he saw him the following day\n had attended the station and told\n\nhim that he had pulled his gun at him while he was riding along the Cameron\n\nHill Main Road going toward Carisbrooks whilst he was in the company of \n\nIan Godwinson\n for the offences of\n\nIllegal Possession of Firearm and Assault and when cautioned the accused man\n\nsaid  A lie the boy  Ronald  a tell pan\n\nme\n as the man whom he had arrested\n\nand charged\n told him about\n\nand under cross-examination he said that the complainant went with him to\n\nshow him the scene where this incident happened and that the place he found\n\nthe accused man was some two and a half miles from where the incident took\n\nplace\n shop and when he went there he saw\n\nthis shop and where it is situated he said\n And where the lighting form the J P S light pole is\n That light pole had light and at the time he went there he said he\n\nnoticed that there was light coming from the pole and light also on the\n\noutside of Miss  Lily's shop\n The light itself was on the building and it shun on to the piazza\n\n And in cross-examination he made reference to the light the light\n\nacross the road from the shop and how   it was\n\ncrossed as you come from Carisbrooks the shop is on the left\n And he also told this Court of the distant the shop is from the\n\nroad were and about seven feet he says\n And that the light itself was a little over a chain after you pass\n\nthe shop\n So this is the evidence he presented by the prosecution and as I\n\nhave said before a very live issue is one of identification\n Is this the man or rather which the Court have to determine\n said he saw on that night\n\nthe fifth of November nineteen ninety-nine\n Who was this man he saw and did this man have a gun which the\n\ncomplainant described to be a firearm\n As judge sitting alone in this matter I have to warn myself about\n\nseveral things\n Let me deal first of all with the issue of identification\n Because the prosecution's case rest wholly on the evidence of\n\nvisual identification\n I must be careful how I assess that evidence because it is possible\n\nthat a person who says he saw someone or he recognises someone who he knew\n\nbefore a perfectly honest witness can make a mistake and he mistakenly make a\n\nmistake but because he is an honest person\n I have to warn myself therefore that it is dangerous to convict a\n\nperson on that evidence\n Say someone that he knows before unless I am satisfied that the\n\nwitness who comes up to give that evidence and claims to have seen and\n\nrecognised this person had the type of opportunity to make that kind of\n\nidentification\n Whereby he recognised the person and to recalled the circumstances\n\nof that recognition\n I must be quite sure that that witness is not making any mistake at\n\nall\n Then I must be satisfied it is a true recognition\n In doing that I will have to take a number of things into\n\nconsideration whether the witness knew this person before and if so for how\n\nlong\n I will have to take into consideration also the condition which\n\nexisted at time this incident happened whether it was daylight or night\n\nwhether there were lights or there were no lights\n The distance that one is from the other is a another matter you\n\nhave to take into consideration\n I have to take into consideration also whether or not this witness\n\nMr  Smith is a credible witness because although he may be saying he\n\nrecognised this person he was at a distance where he could recognise him I\n\nmay not believe at all that he is speaking the truth so his opportunity to\n\nmake out and recognise who this person is and his credibility as a witness\n\nare factors I have to take into consideration\n The Crown must also establish to my satisfaction so that I am sure\n\nthat this object which was seen by  Smith is indeed a firearm and the\n\nwitness has described it as I have said and his knowledge of firearms his\n\nuncle and also security guards he has seen with a gun like the one that this\n\nperson had\n He has told this Court that it was also short and black and this is\n\nevidence which I have to consider as well\n I have to look\n\nat that as well and from what he is saying from the nature of the\n\ncross-examination of the witness  Smith and what Mr  Miller is\n\nsaying is that he was not there when this incident happened so he has raised\n\nthe issue of alibi\n It is the duty of the Prosecution to disprove this alibi\n to prove that he was\n\nelsewhere at the material time", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM',

{'text': "<$A>  So the Prosecution has that burden of disproving the alibi and\n\nI warn myself where the law is concerned of such an issue as alibi and what\n\nare the results if I am to believe Mr  Miller that he was elsewhere\n If I am not too sure if he was elsewhere or if I have a reasonable\n\ndoubt in my mind that he was elsewhere\n I have to warn myself where these matters arise and where the law is\n\nconcerned and what he says is this that he has been living at Tonky District\n\nin this parish that he is a farmer and thirty-two years of age and on the\n\nfifth of last year he was at his mother's house from about seven P M\n He was there until he left that house the following morning\n Before he went to his mother's house he was at his farm at Mount\n\nSemple then he went to his mother's house\n He knows the shop that the complainant is talking about and that\n\nthat shop is about half a mile from his mother's house and that it would take\n\nhim about an hour to walk from that shop to his mother's house\n and he first heard\n\nabout this on the sixth of November from Detective  Albert Duck who is\n\nthe officer in this case\n before the incident and he had a\n\nproblem before with a donkey and that citizens and himself the accused man\n\nhad spoken to  Smith about the donkey\n\n and he answered\n\n\n A donkey sir him steal it in nineteen ninety-nine and bring it up\n\nto him at Mount Semple District him and  Ian Godwinson and bring a lot\n\nof talk in the District\n got the\n\ndonkey from  Smith and that is why  Smith accused him\n\nwrongfully and   nutten like what him say happen go on\n\nthat night\n Cross- examination of the accused man took place and he has\n\nadmitted to this Court having accused the complainant of stealing\n Counsel for the Prosecution raised an issue as to the accused's\n\nprevious conviction\n He was asked about if he was ever charged with an offence before\n\nand he said yes and he also admitted that he had been convicted of an offence\n\nbefore\n As I have said before the issue came up because the accused man\n\nhimself has told the Court that  Smith stole this donkey\n did steal the donkey that he is not\n\na donkey man and he is saying he saw him stealing the donkey and that he\n\ndoesn't own donkeys\n he said\n shop the shop in question where\n\n Smith says he saw him coming from but he was not at that shop on the\n\nnight of the fifth of November\n He drove past there at times when he is on his way about his\n\nbusiness or is taking his child to school\n In respect of where he was on the night of the fifth of November he\n\nsays and maintain that he was at his mother's house watching television\n\nseven-thirty sat there enjoying himself eight-thirty still enjoying himself\n\nnine-thirty sit at her home relaxing he says watching a show\n he says he knows him very well that\n\nis  William Black knows him long time now and he denied that he was on\n\nthe Cameron Hill Road on the fifth of November nineteen ninety-nine\n He said when he left his mother's home on the sixth of November\n\nnineteen ninety-nine he went to market came back and was there for a good\n\nwhile didn't leave there again\n He denied that he was the man who had a firearm\n\n\nSmith and that he doesn't know of anyone by the name of  Ed only a\n\nman called  George Murphy and that he is otherwise called Junior\n I have the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses in this case\n\nand these are my findings of facts\n was in fact riding his motorcycle\n\nalong the main road leading from Carrisbrook in this parish\n at the same time\n\ncame up in close proximity of the bike and hit at his pillion passenger and\n\nthis caused him to move off and ride away with great haste\n I also believe him and accept his evidence that he had to turn off\n\nand ended up beyond where he was going by New Holland Cross Road and then\n\nturned up back to where he was going\n I believe him he went to Maggotty the next day and made a report\n\nabout what took place\n Did he have the kind of opportunity to see who it was who held this\n\nobject in his hand\n when he said that this person\n\nhad a gun in his hand he was able to see this gun because from his previous\n\nknowledge of firearm having regard to seeing his uncle and security guards\n\nwith one like the one he saw and I accept his evidence\n So I do believe and I find that a firearm was in used on the night\n\nof the fifth of November nineteen ninety-nine and that gives me the\n\njurisdiction to deal with this matter\n Did he have the opportunity to see who this person was\n I believe and I accept the witness that there was lighting by way\n\nof electricity electric light on a J P S light pole that there was light\n\ncoming from the shop across from him or sat on his motor cycle and I believe\n\nalso that the light from his motor cycle that was shining gave him that\n\nopportunity to be able to see what was happening\n I believe and I accept also the distance he said the person was\n\nfrom him as he came forward pointing this gun at him and speaking to him in\n\nsuch a manner\n I believe and accept what he says that he saw the whole of this\n\nperson and that he saw the face of this person and that he had known this\n\nperson for some fifteen years\n I believe and I accept that evidence\n I believe and accept his evidence that the very person who he saw\n\nwas a man who he usually give day work on his farm\n I believe and I accept the evidence that he did have the\n\nopportunity to recognised this man and I find and accept and believe that\n\nthis man was the accused man\n I do not take into consideration my disbelief of him because he\n\nadmits that he has been charged previously and that he was previously\n\nconvicted\n He raised it and the prosecution had a right to counter it\n\naccording to the law so it is not because of his previous conviction why I am\n\nsaying I do not believe him\n I do not believe him because I do not think he has been truthful\n\nwhere this matter is concern\n The prosecution therefore has established to my satisfaction to the\n\nextent where I feel sure that this accused man was indeed the man who had\n\nthis firearm illegally in his possession as charged in count one\n The prosecution has also discharged the burden in respect of count\n\ntwo where he used this firearm to point at and to assault the complainant who\n\nspeaks about being in fear afraid and had to move so to speak with speed\n\nhence he found himself going elsewhere rather than going straight home and\n\nthen to his home\n I accept that the prosecution has discharged the burden\n\n\nverdict<$A>\n As you have heard me saying that you are guilty on these two\n\ncharges in the indictment\n One thing is sure is that I will have to keep you confined in some\n\nplace and the question is for how long\n I have to take into consideration also the prevalence of firearm\n\noffences in this country land that we love is on the increase daily\n One cannot pass that over and just put it aside\n It has to be seriously considered\n In every parish every corner of this island gun offences are on the\n\nincrease\n I come here with the circuit there are gun court offences on trial\n\nand everywhere you go it is in that number the use of firearms whether to\n\ninflict injury or to create fear in the minds of others\n The fact that the law says unless you are to hold that firearm or\n\nto keep it in your possession the law says that you have to pay the\n\nconsequences\n It is from a very high point in sentencing when one comes to\n\nconsider illegal possession of firearm offences they start from there and\n\ncome down\n I take into consideration that your first conviction is not a\n\nrelated offence to firearm but is indeed a conviction nevertheless\n I take into consideration that you are a father of three children\n\nbut you should have taken that into mind when you got yourself armed that\n\nnight when Mr  Smith saw you and had to move with grease lightning in\n\nother words to avoid anything happening further\n So on Count one you go to prison for ten years and on Count two two\n\nyears\n Please take him outside for me\n\n\n\n\n<$B>  On the twenty-eighth of August nineteen ninety-eight at about\n\nten P M while the complainant  >Andrew Pepper was in his grocery shop\n\nsituated at Aboukir St Ann three men came in two armed with guns according to\n\nthe complainant and they held him up and robbed him of over three thousand\n\ndollars\n Arising out of this incident the two accused were subsequently\n\narrested and charged for the offences of Illegal Possession of Firearm and\n\nRobbery with Aggravation\n They now stand before this Court on an indictment which charges\n\nthem jointly with the offences of Robbery with Aggravation and Illegal\n\nPossession of Firearm\n The issue here is the correctness of the complainant's\n\nidentification of the two accused persons as two of the three men who entered\n\nhis shop that night\n Each accused has pleaded not guilty to each charge on this\n\nindictment\n Both say that the complainant is mistaken and has incorrectly\n\nidentified them as being involved in the armed robbery\n Now the prosecution called two witnesses the complainant and the\n\narresting or investigating officer Detective Constable  Harry Bottom\n was a most impressive witness and the evidence he\n\nhas given to this court about the gun he saw in his shop on the twenty-eighth\n\nof August nineteen ninety-eight is in my view sufficient for the purposes of\n\nthe Firearms Act to establish the jurisdiction of this court in this matter\n\n\nPepper said he saw three men enter one stood guard by the door one stood\n\nguard over him and the other went to the counter at the point where one\n\nenters on the seller's side of the counter\n Chris\n\nWhite one of the accused before this Court and  Alan Beckman the\n\nother accused before this Court as the one who was by the counter\n He did not know who the third man was\n Now is this evidence evidence upon which this Court can rely\n I warn myself of the special need for caution before the accused\n\ncan be convicted in reliance upon the evidence of visual identification\n I am mindful of the fact that there have been wrongful convictions\n\nin the past as a result of such mistakes and that an apparently convincing\n\nwitness such as Mr  Pepper can be mistaken", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL',

{'text': "<$A>  Where identification involves recognition I am mindful that\n\nmistakes have sometimes been made even in recognition of close friends and\n\nrelatives\n I have therefore carefully examined the circumstances in which the\n\nidentifications were made\n has told this Court that there was light in the\n\nshop\n attorney he\n\nsaid   Then me no must si and me no bline an light in a de\n\nplace\n was about four to five yards from him\n\nand nothing was between them to obstruct his view of the accused\n\n I looked at\n\nhim for about two minutes to three minutes\n He had known him before he would see him sometimes seven times for\n\nthe year up to ten times for the year and he had seen him sometime that year\n\nalthough he did not say exactly when\n Now although the witness did not say what kind of light it was\n\nsufficient for him to see the gun in his hand how it was held and to see the\n\nrag positioned over his head and tied under his chin and he demonstrated in\n\nthe witness box and in his words  leaving out his face bright and\n\nshiny\n He said to counsel in cross-examination that the rag was over the\n\nhead and he took out his own rag saying that his rag was smaller than the one\n\nthe accused had showing us how it was and you could see that the face was\n\nclearly visible in the position that he showed you from the witness box and\n\nthen he said  You can see the face bright and shiny\n Alan\n\nBeckman exactly and the complainant insists that he told the police that\n\none of the men was  Alan Beckman\n Alan\n\nBeckman who put it to him that he did not call  Alan Beckman's\n\nname to the police and he said  Of course I do of course I do of\n\ncourse I do\n He said he used all the names he knew for the accused to the police\n\n He also said that the men were in the shop for about five to ten\n\nminutes or less and he agreed that the incident happened quickly\n he said this\n\n\nme look inna him face fi few minutes about two minutes\n He continued by showing the distance between the face of the\n\naccused and his which was estimated as approximately twelve inches\n There was nothing between their faces to obstruct his view of the\n\naccused man's face\n He said\n Nothing was between the two of us that could stop me seeing\n\nhim light was in the place you know\n He said he knew the accused before\n He would see him in Aboukir Cave Valley Thatch Walk area\n me\n\nknow say me si him all the while\n He continued that he might see him maybe three four times for the\n\nyear\n It all depends on where you go\n He does not remember when he last saw him\n name to the\n\npolice that Friday night of the incident but he is certain that he gave \n\nChris White's name to the police on the Saturday\n a must them\n\nnuh record it the Saturday but I tell them\n\n Again although the complainant did not say what type of lighting\n\nwas in the shop he told  Chris White's attorney that from where he was\n\nsitting in the corner of his shop that night from that position he could see\n\nwhat was going on in the shop and if an ant came in he could see it\n It is therefore reasonable to infer that there was lighting in the\n\nshop sufficient for him to see even an ant comes into the shop\n but not\n\nfrightened so that I don't know myself or know anybody\n Now defence attorneys have pointed out certain weaknesses in the\n\nevidence of identification particular to that area of evidence concerning the\n\nnaming of the accused in the complainant's initial report to the police\n Indeed there are discrepancies in the evidence of the complainant\n\nand contradictions in his evidence when compared with that of the\n\ninvestigating officer\n For example the complainant said in cross-examination when the\n\npolice just came there he gave them the name  Alan Beckman\n Then later on he said\n I don't quite remember if I say I saw a man by the name of\n\n Scooter and one by the name of  Beckman\n he said he did not remember if\n\nwhen the officer first came on the scene at the square he used the name \n\nChris White to them\n He did not remember if he had said to the police as suggested to\n\nhim by defence counsel\n\n He said he knew he told them that he got robbed but he doesn't\n\nremember what else he told them or if he called any name\n Later in cross-examination he said\nthe day after the\n\nrobbery\n\n\nhas told this Court that he had spoken to the complainant on the day after\n\nthe robbery but that it was not until the Monday following that is the\n\nthirty- first of August nineteen ninety-eight that the complainant called the\n\nnames  Chris White and  Scooter Beckman to him and that he then\n\nprepared warrants and started looking for both men\n\n\nexact address for the accused  Alan Beckman although he did\n\nnot record the description in his statement\n Now in assessing the discrepancies and contradictions in this\n\nevidence I am mindful that the complainant is giving evidence on the seventh\n\nof June in the year two thousand about an incident which took place in August\n\nof nineteen ninety-eight and so if the complainant is unable to recall fully\n\nwhat he said or did not say that night it does not in my view render him an\n\nunreliable witness in the circumstances\n This is not a test of memory\n He is certain that he gave names to the police very early after the\n\nincident as early as the day after the incident\n He is unclear in his memory about what he told the police in the\n\nsquare but suffice it to say that it is his unchallenged evidence that the\n\npolice went off on a trail according to him at one point and left to circle\n\nthe area as he puts it at another point after he made the report\n The clear and inescapable inference must be that he told the police\n\nsomething which they felt would enable them to apprehend the robbers\n Otherwise whose trail were they on\n What were they hoping to accomplish in circling the area\n There is no evidence that they took the complainant with them and\n\nhe said  they went\n This investigating officer has told this court that he received\n\ninstructions resulting in a visit to the complainant's shop on the\n\ntwenty-ninth of August ninety-eight and received a report from the\n\ncomplainant as a result of which he carried out investigations in the Aboukir\n\narea\n Alan\n\nBeckman on the twenty-ninth though not from the complainant yet he does\n\nnot start to look for them\n He is investigating he gets information in the course of his\n\ninvestigations but he does nothing about it\n One is left to wonder\n What kind of investigation\n And why after taking the complainant's report he did not record a\n\nstatement but went back on the thirty-first of August nineteen ninety-eight\n\nfor it\n It is of significance that it wasn't the complainant who went to\n\nhim armed with names\n Is it he who went to the complainant and although he says that he\n\nthen got names and had warrants prepared from the thirty-first of August\n\nnineteen ninety-eight it appears from his evidence that it wasn't until the\n\neleventh of September nineteen ninety-eight that he went looking and then\n\nagain not until twentieth of October nineteen ninety-eight\n and he knew that he was also\n\ncalled  Scooter\n\n\nwhom I also know as  Scooter\n In cross- examination he repeats this\n\n\n<Scooter  \n Yet he says that when the complainant gave him the name he carried\n\nout investigations to confirm whether  <Scooter  was the same person\n\nas  Alan\n What investigations\n As it doesn't appear that he even asked complainant or spoke to\n\ncomplainant about it\n Alan\n\nBeckman and in answer to defence attorney an exact address turned out to\n\nbe the name of a district\n And this Detective who is investigating offences of this nature\n\ngets a description which he claims fits the accused  Alan Beckman yet\n\non his evidence he does not record it in his statement\n As between the complainant and the investigating officer I find the\n\ncomplainant to be the more reliable witness and accept complainant's evidence\n\nwherever it conflicts with the officer's\n In any event as the complainant says three officers came to his\n\npremises and he does not know their names\n\n was one of the\n\nthree who came to the shop\n He spoke to them\n They wrote he doesn't know what\n He cannot account for what they may or may not have written\n He is certain that he gave the names to the police before the\n\nthirty-first of August nineteen ninety-eight\n I believe him\n I am mindful that the accused men are not obliged to say anything\n\nin answer to these charges and that indeed they can sit there in the dock and\n\nsay nothing in answer to these charges\n It is for the prosecution to prove the case against each accused\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt so they may sit there and wait to see if the\n\nprosecution proves its case\n stood in the dock and\n\ngave his name and said where he was from and where he worked\n He has in effect said nothing in answer to the charges\n also exercised his right to make a\n\nstatement from the dock\n He also told the Court where he was from and where he worked\n\n\nPepper\n Now it seems clear to me that the defence accepts that the\n\ncomplainant was

has paid his dues in that he has gone to prison for two years\n\nhard labour\n The Court has rendered judgment in this matter\n It is not within me to question but to accept that this is so and to\n\nask your Lordship to in passing your sentence on him to bear in mind that he\n\nhas three children and it seems to have been coming out in the evidence\n\ncertainly from the antecedent that he is a caring father and I know it is a\n\nserious offence anywhere in the world\n I would ask you to consider that no violence was done physically and\n\nin fact even from the word of the complainant he spoke these words from where\n\nhe was he didn't move down on him to do anything\n So I would submit m'Lord that even in the conviction for Assault\n\nthere might be something mitigating although we know that the offence would\n\nhave been complete but mitigating in the sense that there wasn't a pursuit\n Not much one could say about the finding of illegal possession and\n\ncertainly m'Lord I will just ask that in all the circumstances of what is\n\nsaid here his hard work his care for his children three of them that whatever\n\nsentence that the court is going to pass I would urge that the Court hold out\n\na hand of mercy\n He might yet can be rehabilitated and that somehow and that\n\nsomething will be left of him in the future for him to be rehabilitated\n M'Lord is certainly I am sure aware of how and this is not a pitch\n\nfor a non-custodial sentence but m'Lord is certainly aware of the conditions\n\nthat obtain in our jails in the country at this time the stories that have\n\ncome out of them\n Your Lordship has his duty to perform but I am only asking that in\n\nmeasuring the severity of the offence and what damage it might have done that\n\nyour Lordship bears that in mind in coming to a sentence in this matter\n\n\n\n<$B>  My submission my Lady is that this matter in which your\n\nLadyship has to exercise her jury mind that a jury properly directed could\n\nnot convict on the evidence as adduced\n The Crown's case my Lady rests on identification and the\n\ncomplainant's evidence with regard to identification one it contradicts the\n\nevidence given by the police officer in material particulars\n I speak of my Lady the discrepancies in relation to the names given\n The complainant insists my Lady that he gave to the police officer\n\nboth names of  Alan and  Scooter and that he used both names to\n\nthe police officer referring to one person\n\n<$C>  Yes\n\n<$B>  The police officer tells us my Lady that the only name he got\n\nfrom the complainant was the name  Scooter in relation to that accused\n\nand that he thought he might have been referring to one  Alan Beckman\n\nor  could have been were the words he used to one  Alan\n\nBeckman\n Now my Lady if the police officer is to be accepted as a witness of\n\ntruth in this regard one is left with the question\n\n<$C> \n\n<$B>  Yes if\n One is left with the question my Lady that if the complainant in\n\nfact knew that the name of the robber so to speak was Dexter why is it that\n\nhe did not tell the police so\n\n<$C>  Yes\n\n<$B>  my Lady I would\n\nsuggest or submit that if the officer or the witness is to be believed in\n\nthis regard the police officer m'Lady we continue in that vein and accept\n\nthat it has not been proven that the person referred to as  Scooter\n\nwas identified as the same person as  Alan Beckman\n Alan\n\nBeckman\n Again we call into question my Lady the account given by the\n\ncomplainant which the officer said in that my Lady if one is robbed one\n\nrecognises and knows the person who robbed you makes two reports certainly we\n\ncan deal with the report made to the police officer and yet still on that\n\noccasion does not indicate to the police officer investigating the matter who\n\nit is that robbed him\n And clearly from the police officer's account he did not have the\n\ninformation before the thirty-first\n\n<$C>  From the complainant you mean\n\n<$B>  From the complainant\n\n\nbefore he got that name from the complainant or before he got a name from the\n\ncomplainant\n These differences in the Crown's case as presented which are not\n\nresolved I submit my Lady are such as should cause her Ladyship to say that\n\nthe Crown's case has not reached that standard which is required\n Alan\n\nBeckman ought not to be called upon to answer the charge\n May it so please you my Lady\n\n<$C>  you haven't told me of your intention\n\n<$D> \n\nChris White is one solely of identification and I would submit that the\n\nmajor quality of the identification evidence against him is not of the\n\nstandard that should require you as judge of the law to call upon Mr \n\nChris White to answer to the charges against him in the indictment\n I need not recite the well known authority for your Ladyship but I\n\nwill just highlight that    apart from the\n\ncircumstances of what I would term I haven't seen it in this authority\n\nperhaps it is a novel approach primary identification that is identification\n\non the scene primary identification that apart from the primary\n\nidentification the authority indicates that one ought to look at the conduct\n\nof the complainant during such time after he has been affected by the crime\n\nin question meaning\n\n<$C>  I am sorry\n\n<$D>  Complainant so soon after the crime has been committed does he\n\nhave an opportunity to make a report\n How soon after the incident does he make a report\n And it is in Turnbull and it is the Queen versus Turnbull\n Does he know his assailant and this is the category of case of\n\nidentification or recognition does he know his assailants how well does he\n\nknow them what is the report that he makes does he call any names does he\n\ngive any description\n In this case the complainant had the opportunity the Friday night\n\nand said in his evidence he doesn't recall if he told the police officer who\n\nhis assailants were which would be strange if he knew them\n He says what he is sure he told them that he was robbed\n He has a second opportunity the morning after the incident when the\n\ninvestigating officer in this case comes to him to take a report and the\n\nofficer says that the complainant did not give him the name  Chris\n\nWhite\n And this is a man that he knows and knows his name\n The officer of course says he hears things in the air and that is\n\nhearsay and I am not sure if the complainant was the beneficiary of such\n\nhearsay as well but the third opportunity he calls the name  Chris\n\nWhite\n This conduct must indicate that he was not sure or he didn't know\n\nand was told subsequently\n When you take into consideration and join that with the fact that\n\nthe incident took place quickly must have taken place quickly if you accept\n\nthe way he narrated he said two minutes but your Ladyship saw and heard how\n\nhe narrated how the incident took place\n There is evidence of light in the shop\n I do not hear what type of lighting it was where the lighting was\n\nwhether it was on the ceiling\n\n<$C>  It certainly seems that there was light sufficient for him to\n\nsee\n\n<$D>  The Crown must prove and the Crown didn't lead evidence in\n\nsuch particularity as to satisfy you in my view that you should call upon Mr\n\n White to answer to the charge on the indictment and I so urge you my\n\nLady\n\n\n\n\n<$E>  May it please you m'Lady indeed the sole issue for Ladyship is\n\nthat of identification and this turns apart from the circumstances on which\n\nthe identification was made on the  evidence whether or not\n\nyou believe them the conduct of the police and certainly the credibility of\n\nthe complainant\n In so far as the complainant is concerned and I deal with that\n\nfirstly m'Lady my submission is that the identification in respect of each\n\naccused person is indeed satisfactory to the extent where your Ladyship\n\nshould call on both accused men to answer the charges against them\n The circumstances in which the identification was made m'Lady are\n\nsatisfactory circumstances the prior knowledge of each accused man by the\n\ncomplainant the one to two minutes view of each accused man's face in\n\nlighting which is good enough to see and in one case right up in the face of\n\nthe complainant and in the other at a distance which your Ladyship saw some\n\ntwo to three yards I believe m'Lady with nothing interfering no obstruction\n\nto the view no covering on the face\n That there are discrepancies the Crown must concede but in this\n\ncase m'Lady the complainant's credibility is what I commend to you\n Complainant said that he told the police the names he gave them all\n\nthe names\n A must dem no record it but mi tell\n\nthem to use his own words\n So m'Lady we must separate that from the conduct of the police\n\nwhich I will come to\n Because you see m'Lady there are two questions\n There is the question did the complainant see each of these accused\n\npersons in circumstances which would allow him to properly identify them\n\nbearing in mind that it is a recognition case and my submission is that he\n\ndid in relation to each\n He maintained at all times that he told the police who they were\n He said he used all the names he knew\n\n\nScooter  Beckman and  Chris White in relation to the other\n\none\n And he told the police because he knew and he is not mistaken about\n\nit\n I cannot help but say m'Lady that the conduct of the police really\n\nleaves something to be desired even though the police is called on the\n\nCrown's case\n I cannot but say that the conduct is less than satisfactory and\n\nacceptable\n But m'Lady does that affect the identity of these two men bearing\n\nin mind that it is to more than one police officer that the complainant spoke\n And the officer who was called is not the first officer to whom the\n\ncomplainant spoke that officer received information and instructions and it\n\nis the manner in which he carried out those instructions that is called into\n\nquestion\n And if your Ladyship must choose who to believe my submission is\n\nthat you believe the complainant because indeed the conduct of the police\n\nleaves something to be desired in this case\n But in the same way that when your Ladyship instructs a jury your\n\nLadyship will say that you can choose to accept which witness to believe\n\nwhich part of the witness's evidence in the same way your Ladyship no doubt\n\ncan do the same in the capacity as a jury\n is\n\nconcerned the case is clear\n\n is the\n\nsame  Chris White that is before the Court\n Alan\n\nBeckman\n The police said he didn't get it\n It is a matter for you m'Lady to say which you accept but I would\n\nurge your Ladyship to accept the complainant bearing in mind that the\n\ncomplainant spoke to other police and that police received the information\n\nfrom other police\n So that yes there are discrepancies but I do not believe they go to\n\nthe root the matter bearing in mind that no suggestion was made to the\n\nwitnesses that this is not the same man before the court",

{'text': "<$A>  stands accused of rape and the\n\nparticulars of the allegations are that on May eighteenth two thousand and\n\nfour while at the apartment of Miss Felicia Gentle he had sexual intercourse\n\nwith her without her consent\n Milady the ground for this application is that there exist no\n\nsubstantial grounds to support a belief that Mr Jack falls into any of the\n\ncriteria listed in section four of the Bail Act\n\n\npersonal to section three of the said Act\n Milady the Defence is aware that rape is a serious offence, but\n\nthe allegations made against Mr Jack we submit are very weak\n The only evidence of corroboration is arguable and undoubtedly it\n\nwill be argued at trial\n\n\nMilady Mr Jack and Miss  relationship came to an end\n\n   around May seventeen two thousand and four\n\nand Mr Jack has not seen    or has\n\nbeen in contact with the complainant since that date\n As I said earlier he was arrested on May twenty- third two thousand\n\nand four between May seventeen and two thousand and four where he was free to\n\nsee her if he wanted to he didn't\n served as the\n\npresident of his area's cricket club since nineteen ninety-nine, he is a\n\nnotable donor for a local cricket tournament in his  areal and he's a\n\nmentor for persons who have expressed an interest in working in the banking\n\nand finance sector\n\n\nBank with responsibilities that include overseeing the general day-to-day\n\nactivities of that institution\n If Mr Jack is, not granted bail Milady his wealth of experience\n\nbecause he's been working there for ten years would be  \n\n sorely missed by that institution and by extension the number of\n\ncustomers that use the bank\n He has, not denied the fact Milady that he had an extramarital\n\naffair with the complainant in the case\n However Mr Jack admits that, he made some poor choices in that\n\nregard, and as a result, he is willing to make up for those mistakes\n\nhe does not want to be taken away from his family they need him right now and\n\nhe needs them right now\n Milady he has cooperated with the police whenever he was requested\n\nwhenever he was asked to do so    and also on his own\n\nvolition\n Milady because he is eager to have this day in court and because he\n\nhas nothing to hide Mr Jack is willing to subject himself to certain\n\nconditions of bail\n Firstly that he report to the Matilde's Corner Police Station at\n\nleast three times per week, we suggest Sundays Tuesdays and Thursdays\n\nbetween the hours of 6 a m and 6 p m\n He's willing to hand over his travel documents, and Mr Jack will\n\ncontinue, to observe the practice that he had instituted on his own not to\n\nsee any of the prosecution witnesses or any of the witnesses in relation with\n\nthis matter,\n\n\ngrateful if    bail is granted to him and\n\nhe will be willing to comply with  ,  any\n\ncondition that Milady sees  minded to institute\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  May it please you Milady, the Prosecution recognises the\n\naccused's entitlement to bail, however there are two issues which the\n\nProsecution finds troubling in respect of which we must we are afraid,\n\noppose the application made by learned counsel for the Defence\n May I draw your Ladyship's attention to section four of the Bail\n\nAct in particular subparagraphs one and three of subsection eight of that\n\nsection\n We disagree, with great respect, with the submissions made by\n\nthe learned friends of the Defence regarding the likelihood of the defendant\n\nabsconding bail\n The accused is a man of almost unlimited means a very wealthy\n\nindividual with the resources available to him to easily slip out of the\n\njurisdiction\n Even if the accused surrenders his travel documents as my friends\n\nhave suggested he still has the means to leave the country\n And now that the trial has reached this stage the Prosecution fears\n\nthat the temptation to leave the island will be too great\n We also mentioned subparagraph three of section four a of the Bail\n\nAct\n It is the evidence of the complainant which we intend to adduce at\n\ntrial that Mr Jack the accused has threatened to disrupt her employment by\n\ninforming her employer of their relationship which he very well knew it could\n\ncost her her job\n This is the complainant's only source of income and it is not a\n\nbountiful source of income at that and with this power that the defendant\n\nwields and has    at previous occasions threatened to\n\nuse the Prosecution's a bit more than apprehensive that the defendant will\n\ninterfere with the main witness for the Prosecution\n May I also advert for submission made by my learned friend when she\n\nstated that Mr Jack cooperated with the police on his own volition\n It is the evidence of police officer Danielle Mighty which we\n\nintend to adduce that when she approached Mr Jack about the allegations\n\nagainst him of rape he lied to her in that regard\n I therefore disagree with the greatest of respect that he has\n\ncooperated with the police on his own volition whenever we asked\n In any event we are in your hands Milady\n Those are the submissions of the Prosecution, if it pleases\n\nyou\n\n\n\n<$A>  If it pleases you Milady, the introductions have already\n\nbeen made so I need not bore you with a repetition of them\n I am Nicholene Nelson and I am here representing the Prosecution in\n\nthis case,\n I think we should just go into the meat of the matter, this case\n\nconcerns rape\n Now we all have our own definitions of what rape is or what it is\n\nnot, but today we're in a court of law and you must be guided by its\n\neighth definition\n Now the law defines rape as when a man has sexual intercourse with\n\na woman without her consent\n And it is crucial that you should appreciate Members of the Jury\n\nthat at the time that the sexual intercourse is taking place the man knows\n\nthe woman does not consent or simply doesn't care whether she consents or not\n\n<,>\n Now, that's the definition of rape\n What are the facts in this case that brings you here today\n The complainant, is Felicia Gentles and she's complaining that\n\nthis man, the accused, Michael Jack raped her\n appreciate the circumstances under which\n\nthis rape occurred I need to take you on a little journey, and I know that\n\nwe're all  pressed for time so I'll be as brief as I possibly can\n Felicia Gentles at the time of the rape was twenty-three years of\n\nage\n She was a naive young woman living with her grandmother\n Now there comes a point in all our lives where we have to fend for\n\nourself, so she decides that she needs to find a job\n She finds a job at the Relax Spa Salon as a masseuse\n Now while there she meets the accused Michael Jack\n He's very suave very charming very handsome very wealthy so he\n\nknows how to treat a woman\n Anyways he comes there and they meet they made eye-contact and the\n\nrest as they say is history\n They start having sex\n Now at first this sex takes place in hotels because he gives her\n\nthe excuse that he's recently been divorced and he has two children and he\n\ndoesn't want to traumatise them with introducing a new woman\n Now she accepts this excuse it seemed reasonable to her\n They go out on a couple of dates and he's very controlling so he\n\ndecides that he's going to get her an apartment puts her up in a very ritzy\n\napartment\n He comes over there whenever he wants sex\n don't know\n\nthat he's married\n She's very happy I mean who wouldn't be the man is handsome he is\n\nwealthy he treats her the way a lady should be treated\n However this happiness has to come to an end as all things do\n She finds out from a friend of hers Patricia Onvy who will appear\n\ntoday to testify that this man is in fact married\n I am not going to\n\nput myself in a situation where I am having sexual intercourse with a married\n\nman\n To her it is one thing to have sex with a man out of wedlock but\n\nit's quite another to have sex with a man who is already committed to\n\nsomebody else\n So she decides that she's going to end the relationship\n He comes over that night probably for sex we don't really know\n\n\nand    he doesn't deny this and he puts up some\n\nresistance and he tells her all kinds of story about how much he loves her\n\nand he's not happy with his wife\n But Ladies and Gentlemen she's a moral person and she decides that\n\n no matter what I am determined to end this relationship irrespective\n\nof the fact that I love this man\n So she turns him away, she packs up her things and she calls him\n\nat his office and she tells him to come over, because Ladies and Gentlemen\n\nshe's determined on giving him    his keys\n\nand returning the apartment to him\n her,\n\napproaches her the way a man does a woman and apparently believed that\n\nbecause of their relationship she should yield\n\n\nno, this relationship is ending tonight\n\n\nhow dare this twenty-three year old tell me that she's ending our\n\nrelationship, me the big general manager of the  High Holders\n\nBank\n So of course he decides to debase her Ladies and Gentlemen in the\n\nworst way that a man can debase a woman\n He throws her down on the bed and he has sex with her\n Ladies and Gentlemen at the time she did not consent and she\n\nexpressed this she said  no, no Michael but he didn't\n\nlisten\n He did it anyways\n After he was finished, pulled up his pants, he left\n\n\ncore of the Prosecution's case\n We will call evidence today from a medical practitioner a doctor\n\nJuliann Smith\n She will testify as to the findings of bruises that she found on\n\nthe complainant's body\n We will also call the evidence of her friend Patricia Onvy\n She will also testify you must determine of what relevance that is\n\nto you,\n What is your role today why are you here, why are we taking up\n\nyour valuable time\n Well, the fact is I don't know what happened that night, the\n\nDefence they don't know what happened that night, her Ladyship don't know\n\neither\n\n\nexactly what happened that night is the accused and Felicia Gentles\n Now she say that he raped her he say that he didn't\n So we need an impartial group of people to determine exactly what\n\nhappened\n Ladies and Gentlemen you are the fact finders in this case\n What does that mean\n You could compare yourself to a lie detector, you're going to\n\nsit there listen to the evidence and determine who is telling the truth based\n\non the evidence that is presented to you\n Now it's hard for me to tell you to divorce your emotions from this\n\ncase because we are people we're all emotional, but I want you to listen\n\nto the evidence as it is presented and nothing else\n Determine from the demeanour of the witnesses as they go into the\n\nwitness box and based on everything that is presented you must determine if\n\nwe the Prosecution have presented the case such that you are left sure that\n\nthe accused is guilty, and I mean you're left sure there should be no\n\ndoubts in your mind\n What is the judge's role\n her role is to tell you what the law is\n Now I gave you a brief definition of what rape is, at the\n\nappropriate time she will direct you in a more comprehensive way on what it\n\nis then you will go and you will deliberate amongst yourself and you will\n\ncome back here and I trust that you will return the verdict that is just in\n\nthis case,\n Now if it pleases you

{'text': "<$A>  Ladies and Gentlemen, if we each get a dollar for every time\n\nwe hear the saying  actions speak louder than words we'd\n\nprobably be loaded right now, even more than <unclear> words</unclear>\n the Defence\n\nsubmits that Miss Gentle's behaviour  \n\n from the time she met Mr Jack, to the time of his arrest is\n\ninconsistent with her allegations that Mr Jack raped her\n Her, actions speak louder than her words, Ladies and Gentlemen\n\n\n I will go to the events in the order that they happened, bring\n\nup the issues that arise within that  circle time period or date,\n\nand highlight the flaws of the Prosecution's case, and the strengths of\n\nthe Defence's case, to show you why her actions, should count for more\n\nthan her words here today\n First is, May seventeenth, two thousand and four\n The first issue is whether or not Miss Gentle knew Mr Jack was\n\nmarried\n The Defence's story, is that, Miss Gentle knew that he was\n\nmarried all along, because he told her from the beginning\n\n\nMiss Jack was married for the first time on May seventeenth, when she\n\nwas out to lunch with her friend\n But Ladies and Gentlemen, look what the Prosecution calls to\n\nsupport Miss Gentle's story, a woman who, the Defence submits, is\n\nfilled with bitterness and anger, at Mr Jack because he changed her as his\n\nmasseuse, and reduced her income, an income that Mr Jack was\n\nsignificantly contributing to, for several years\n Part of her income was gone, and for a single mother of two\n\nyoung children we know that every dollar counts, she said that\n So she was so upset, at that Ladies and Gentlemen\n So we can't believe everything she says, including the fact that\n\nMr Jack used to talked to her about his marriage  with her or that she\n\nintercepted some call from someone she thinks sounds like Mr Jack\n Her only purpose here today was to lie for her friend\n\n\nMiss Onvy knew my apologies that Mr Jack was married all along\n So Ladies and Gentlemen in coming to a decision here today we ask\n\nyou to use your common sense, your intelligence, and your own\n\nexperiences, to aid you in coming to that in a conclusion\n Luckily, we have three women on the Jury, so you will be able\n\nto understand specifically what I'm about to say\n\n\nworked in a salon, a spa and salon\n Now Ladies, you know, that the salon is the place where you\n\ncould go and find out anybody's business\n They chat day in day out\n Miss\n\nOnvy knew, they knew about Mr Jack and as counsel himself say he\n\nread about him in the newspaper\n bank manager of\n\nthe bank  the general manager of the bank yet you don't know\n\nhe was, married he comes in here, he says, three times a week,\n\nevery week for the last four to five years\n Nobody knew that he was married\n I think not\n The second issue is who broke off the relationship on May\n\nseventeenth two thousand and four\n The Defence's story is that Mr Jack broke off the relationship\n\nbecause Miss Gentle became too demanding\n Miss Gentle contends that she broke off the relationship after she\n\nfound out he was married\n But Ladies and Gentlemen, for a person who claims to have ended\n\na relationship she sure didn't act that way\n Let me tell you why I say this\n According to Miss Gentle, after Mr Jack confirmed that he was\n\nmarried, she was upset angry and confused so much so that she wanted to\n\nend the relationship\n But let us look at some of the events before May seventeenth to\n\nsupport the Defence's submission that Miss Gentle did not end the\n\nrelationship\n For the sake of and in the name of love Miss Gentle moved out,\n\nabandoned her old grandmother, for a man that she had only known for two\n\nmonths\n She risked losing her job, she accepted the fact that she could\n\nnot call a man who she considered hers, at his home, and accepted that\n\nthe love and the passion that they had for one another had to stay between\n\nthem\n She was ok with hiding away in a hotel, and ok with hiding away\n\nin the apartment, but she dealt with it, probably because she thought\n\nshe had to\n\n But Miss Gentle and the Prosecution would like you to believe\n\nLadies and Gentlemen Ladies my apologies that after doing all of these things\n\n<,> before May seventeenth, that when she found out that Mr Jack was\n\nmarried she finally stood up for herself\n Think not\n\n\nw  had a wife\n Not\n Well if that was the straw that broke the camel's back as they say\n\n<,> why didn't she leave\n Why on that same night did she not go back to her grandmother,\n\nwhy not go to her friend Patricia Envy\n She didn't have to pay any rent and she had money she could have\n\nstayed in a hotel if she was so intent on leaving\n But because she was not intending on leaving she's\n this is\n\nthe night when the alleged rape took place\n Miss Gentle also said, that she was disturbed by Mr Jack being\n\nmarried so much so that she decided to return the keys for the apartment and\n\n<,> break off the relationship\n Instead of calling him and telling him where the keys were after\n\nshe left, or, sending or posting the keys to Mr Jack's office, or\n\ngiving the keys to Miss Faithful    she\n\nknew where Miss Faithful was, she had conversations with her,\n\nshe was familiar with her\n But instead of doing that, she called him and demanded that he\n\ncome over to the apartment\n If she was the one that broke off the relationship Ladies, she\n\nwouldn't be calling, he would be the one calling\n Her behaviour in the May eighteenth is still not consistent with\n\nsomeone who is certain that she didn't want to be in a relationship anymore\n There was no reason why Miss Gentle had to physically see Mr Jack\n\n<,> to return the keys\n let me\n\npoint out at this moment, how ready, to leave could you have been on\n\nthe eighteenth when Miss Onvy testified here that on the twenty-third she was\n\npacking frantically\n So where were you going on the eighteenth, you were gonna leave\n\nyour stuff\n That's not the end of a relationship, wasn't it she didn't break\n\noff the relationship on the eighteenth, she had no intention of leaving\n lived in the house,\n\nin the apartment for the next five days  functioned and entertained\n\n   a guest Miss Onvy in the apartment, yet she\n\nwas packed and ready to go, on the eighteenth\n on\n\nthat date is whether or not    Mr Jack had\n\nMiss Gentle's consent when they had sex that night\n\n\n  Jack's Defence is consent, which means that\n\nwhen he and Miss Gentle had sex in  the evening he thought, he\n\nbelieved that she did not object, but Miss Gentle's behaviour during and\n\nafter sex is more in light with behaviour after\n\nconsensual sex\n Let's explore this\n May seventeenth ended with Miss Gentle being angry\n Mr Jack said she was angry because, he broke up with her\n found out he was married\n Bottom line, she was angry\n She was so angry with Mr Jack on the seventeenth, that she\n\nwanted to end the relationship\n She was angry into the eighteenth so much so that she wanted to\n\nreturn keys\n Miss Gentle admits\n\n<,> that again, in the name of love, she did not fight, she did not\n\nresist him, when Mr Jack, made love to her\n All of a sudden, Miss Jack suddenly is no longer angry, I\n\nwonder why\n Miss Gentle sorry is no longer angry, after being so angry on\n\nthe seventeenth so angry on the eighteenth when she had sex on the eighteenth\n\neverything was, great\n what's the\n\nlaw<,>and I'm sure her Ladyship and    the\n\nProsecution will tell you, that there is no requirement that the person\n\nkick scream fight call for Jesus to object to rape but an angry woman    who the day before said she broke off the\n\nrelationship with her attacker just, laid back\n She would have fought back Ladies and Gentlemen if she was being\n\nraped, in her story that is\n\n\n\n<$A>  She kicked and pulled, but she never said\n She said she said no, the Defence submits that she never said no\n Mr Jack said Miss Gentle never said no as I say or gave him any\n\nreason to believe that she'd not want to have sex\n In fact he said that she was the one who seduced him, or who\n\ninitiated the events\n She begged for one more for the road\n Mr Jack strived to resist but memories of the good times between\n\nthem, and the opportunity to have one last taste of passion weakened his\n\nresolve and he gave in to her final attempt, to remind him what she could\n\noffer, if she stayed\n That is why she called, and demanded to see him, not to\n\nreturn the keys\n That is the Defence's position but the Prosecution would have you\n\nto believe that the way it happened, was that, Mr Jack made sexual\n\n<unclear> word</unclear> she refused, he got upset, threatened to tell\n\nher boss that they were having a relationship    but Ladies a man who went to such extent to keep\n\nhis relationship private, would he threaten to carry it out in the open\n No he wouldn't, absolutely not\n They had sexual intercourse that night, she seduced him,\n\naroused his hormones, it was passionate, as usual, and it was\n\nconsensual, as usual\n The evidence of doctor Julian Smith again, helps us in the sense\n\nthat he says    he can't say that she was\n\nraped\n He's not certain, he's not certain\n But what shows us conclusively that Miss Gentle was not raped\n Miss Gentle's\n\nbehaviour in the period of May eighteenth two thousand and four,\n\neverything was business as usual for her but the Prosecution wants to believe\n\ndifferent\n Miss Gentle testified here today that she was so distraught that\n\nnight after Mr Jack allegedly raped her,    but what\n\ndid she do after she supposedly suffered this ordeal\n stayed in the same\n\nhouse probably slept in the same bed where the trauma occurred every\n\nnight for the next five nights\n She went to work the next morning as usual, carried on her work\n\nresponsibilities as usual because there was nothing\n\nunusual happening other than she had <unclear> word</unclear> lost her\n\nboyfriend,\n,\n\nI go on she was so distraught after she supposedly was raped that not only\n\ndid she accept the roses and the gift card Mr Jack sent her the following day\n\nbut she took them home and had them in the apartment\n Why not throw them away, if you don't want anything else from\n\nthis man she would have thrown them away if that was the end of the\n\nrelationship\n This is not the behaviour of a person who has been raped\n The clothes got discarded Ladies and Gentlemen Miss Gentle said\n\nthat, the clothes got discarded\n Why not the expensive gifts that he used to give you all throughout\n\nthe year",

{'text': "<$A>  If it pleases you Milady, Members of the Jury, this is a\n\ncase about control, about a man who is the manager of one of the top\n\nfinancial institutions in this  town, a man who manages thousands\n\nof employees he said so, a wealthy man, an influential man, a man\n\nwho is used to being in control, a man who had an extramarital\n\nrelationship with Felicia Gentles, this is not denied\n From day one he was in control of that relationship, he requested\n\nthat she do his massages, he asked her out on their first date, when\n\nthey started to have sex she moved out of her grandmother's house in an\n\napartment that he provided for her\n If she wanted to call him, she had to text him first and get his\n\npermission, he was in control at all times during their relationship\n And the one time, he was not in control when Miss Gentles found\n\nout about his marriage and told him  no she was not going to\n\ncontinue the relationship<,> he took control, and that is why we are here\n\ntoday<,>\n how we are all humans, nobody\n\nwants to sit down and listen to long evidence\n But evidence is long, because the details are important\n Mr Jack is charged for rape\n I didn't\n\nrape anybody\n I wasn't there on night of the eighteenth\n I don't think you were there on the night of the eighteenth\n The only two people who where there were Michael Jack and Felicia\n\nGentles and they are saying two different things\n This is why the evidence has been so long because it is so\n\nimportant, and we must use the evidence and our common sense, to help\n\nus figure out what really happened on the night of the eighteenth of May\n This is what the Prosecution is saying\n The Prosecution is saying that Michael Jack and Felicia Gentles had\n\na relationship, this is not in dispute\n What is in dispute is the circumstances of their relationship\n The Prosecution's case is that Mr Jack, a powerful experienced\n\nbusinessman saw an opportunity in a young naive masseuse who grew up with her\n\ngrandmother\n She wasn't very experienced in the ways of the world, she wasn't\n\nused to lavish treatment, she wasn't used to attention, it was an\n\nopportunity for Michael Jack to take advantage of a vulnerable woman\n powerful experienced\n\nbusinessman, seen many things in this world<,> Felicia\n\nGentles<,> twenty-four years old<,> grew up with\n\nher grandmother<,> barely finished high school\n Mr Jack saw an opportunity to control Miss Gentles in the same way\n\nhe controlled so many other areas of his life\n She carried on a relationship with this kind of man\n It is the Prosecution's case, contrary to what we have been told\n\nby Michael Jack, that she never knew that he was married\n Why would he tell her\n She was somebody to sleep with at convenient times, and just\n\nthat\n she'd\n\nleft her grandmother's house, and she knew him for only two months, why\n\nwould she do that, actions speak louder than words\n This is the extent to which she loved him and trusted him\n Would she have left her grandmother's house to move into an\n\napartment that he provided if she did not really think the relationship was\n\ngoing somewhere\n Would she have carried on a relationship with a man knowing it\n\ncould cost her her job unless she thought he was serious or could have been\n\nserious\n Actions do in fact speak louder than words\n What do her actions indicate to you\n She trusted this man, she loved this man\n This is a man who was used to being in control and from day one,\n\nhe pulled the strings in that relationship, that was  evident\n Members of the Jury, he never told her, that he was married\n She was more easy to control the more ignorant she was\n This is not a man on whom we can rely for full and frank disclosure\n He saw an opportunity to keep Miss Gentles under his thumb and when\n\nshe found out about his marriage and remembered the principle that she had\n\nlearned growing up and stood up for herself and told Mr Michael Jack \n\nno, he cut her down in the worst way a man can cut down a woman\n You may ask yourselves, if she was raped, why didn't she\n\nfight, why didn't she scream, because the law recognises that\n\nsubmission is not equal to consent\n and on the\n\neighteenth of May two thousand and four Felicia Gentles submitted to Michael\n\nJack, and he had sex with her knowing full well that she did not consent\n And that, Members of the Jury, is rape\n Submission to force is not equal to consent\n The Prosecution has called four witnesses\n The first, Miss Gentles\n She told you what happened, she told you she was taken up by\n\nthis rich charming man\n She told you that not once during their relationship did he tell\n\nher that he was married\n He in fact told her that he was recently divorced, and could not\n\ncarry her home because    it would traumatise his\n\nchildren\n You may think that Miss Gentles should have known better, or\n\nthat she should have been a little smarter to have bought that story\n But the last time I checked the law being naive wasn't a crime\n On the other hand, rape is\n And that is why Felicia Gentles is not on trial today but Mr\n\nMichael Jack\n The Defence has raised questions about why she kept the roses in\n\nher apartment after she was raped why wouldn't she want to discard the roses\n How come she didn't know that he was married it was all over the\n\nnewspapers\n\n\nshe was raped the day after stay in a hotel\n Miss Envy saw her\n\non the twenty-  Miss Onvy saw\n\nher on the twenty-third\n what the Defence is asking you to do is to\n\npresume to know the mind of a raped woman\n We don't know if she packed her things unpacked them because she\n\nwas so confused and repacked them when Miss Onvy saw her we don't know\n We don't know why she kept the roses if she still loved him or\n\nwasn't sure what to do\n We don't know\n We cannot enter the mind of a raped woman because as far as I'm\n\naware she was not raped and neither were you\n Felicia Gentles was\n We cannot presume to know what was in her mind the week of the\n\neighteenth the night after she was raped\n And by the way, Miss Gentles, does she appear to you to be a\n\nwoman who reads newspapers frequently\n Members of the Jury, then I do not\n\nsuggest you attach any weight to the fact that she did not know that he was\n\nmarried because in fact Members of the Jury he never told her\n He is a dishonest man\n We called Patricia Onvy, we called Patricia Onvy\n\n\n would have you believe was bitter because she lost income from\n\nMichael Jack\n You heard her say in this witness box that she had other clients\n\napart from Mr Jack\n She's a masseuse it's a business did she have one client no she had\n\nother clients you heard her say other clients tipped her\n Losing Mr Jack as a client did not adversely affect her income\n She's not bitter Members of the Jury, what reason does she have\n\nto lie\n She told you that she informed Miss Gentles for the first time at\n\nlunch that he was married\n is that why she lied, is that\n\nher reason to lie\n Miss Onvy has demonstrated no reason to you\n\nto lie\n Do you think that she would concoct this story in an elaborate\n\nattempt to bring Michael Jack down, or did she give some support to a\n\nfriend who needed some support because of what she went through\n I leave that question for you\n Do you know why you may want to believe what Miss Onvy has said\n Because is consistent with what Miss Gentles has said\n Both of them say that she came to the apartment on May twenty-\n\nthree\n Both of them say that Miss Gentles broke down in tears and told her\n\nthat she was raped\n Both of them say that they went to the police station\n\n\nwitne  witness confirmed this\n It is consistent\n many women get raped and do\n\nnot report it, yet Miss Onvy still encouraged Miss Gentles to report what\n\nhappened to her  at the police\n Did she do that to bring Michael Jack down, or did she recognize\n\nthat her friend was hurting and did she encourage  her to do the right\n\nthing\n Miss Onvy's evidence is consistent with the evidence of that given\n\nby Miss Gentles and she has demonstrated no reason whatsoever to lie\n We called the police officer Danielle Mighty and she told you that\n\ntwo woman came to her station to report a rape\n This is consistent for the previous two witnesses have said so so\n\nfar we have three consistent witnesses\n She also told you that she called Mr Jack and informed him about\n\nthe allegation and do you know what he did\n He lied, he lied to the police\n This has been acknowledged by Mr Jack himself\n Do you believe that Mr Jack suddenly grew honest during this trial\n This is a man who could not seem to recognize his own hand-writing\n\n<,>\n Mr Jack, is a big man you heard him say so, and he has not\n\ndisplayed honesty and you know what they say, Members of the Jury, you\n\ncan't teach an old dog new tricks\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  Very well\n I'm grateful\n We called the doctor\n you\n\nhave heard them say that the doctor could not tell if she was raped\n\nor  if it was forceful sex\n You heard me ask the doctor he said that no doctor could, tell\n\n<unclear> word</unclear> consented to sex\n The injuries he found at her were consistent with forceful sex,\n\nthe injuries he found on her were also consistent with rape\n The Defence would like you very much to believe that the injuries\n\nshe sustained were as a result of forceful sex\n You heard the doctor describe the bruising to her inner thighs\n You heard him say that a woman can obtain bruising to the inner\n\nthighs when she's trying to close her legs to prevent a man from entering her\n of the\n\nJury sound like rape\n Furthermore Mr Michael Jack says that Felicia Gentles was on top\n I wonder then how she got the bruises\n The bruises, the doctor found the bruises on the Sunday, the\n\nincident occurred on the Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday\n The bruises were still there\n Forceful sex, yes the sex was forceful but it was not\n\nconsensual\n Do not let the Defence make a fool of you,\n Mr Jack says that Miss Gentles came on to him so strong on the\n\neighteenth that he could not resist and the sex was consensual\n Miss Gentles says that she confronted him about his marriage and\n\nthey broke up, they broke up and he was not content with letting her walk\n\nout of his life and the following day he raped her\n You have heard the evidence of the Prosecution\n What more could we give you\n That was the Prosecution's case\n We have a duty to satisfy you until you feel sure that he is\n\nguilty, but you must first listen to what Michael Jack has had to say\n It is only fair\n The Prosecution is not asking you for favours, we're asking to\n\nlisten to all of the evidence and come to your own conclusion\n The Defence called two witnesses, the accused, and his\n\nsecretary,\n Mr Jack told us that he told Felicia Gentles that he was a married\n\nman and they conducted their relationship on that mutual understanding,\n\nthat he ended the relationship, that she threatened to tell his wife if\n\nnot come over one last time, and when he came over    she pressured him, she pressured him to have\n\nsex and that after the sex, which was passionate as he described it he\n\nsent her roses the next day apologising for hurting her\n Members of the Jury, Mr Jack concealed his relationship from\n\nhis wife of fourteen years\n He lied to his wife, this is not in dispute\n When officer Danielle Mighty confront him about this allegation\n\n<,> he lied to her, <unclear> word</unclear> police\n He lied to his wife of fourteen years, he lied to the police\n\nofficer when she confronted him about some serious allegations\n Up to moment ago Members of the Jury you were strangers to Michael\n\nJack\n If he can lie to his wife, and lie to police, who are you\n\nfor Michael Jack to lie to\n What has stopped him from lying to you today,\n He says, he never raped, Felicia Gentles\n Truth is, many of us, if not all of us, would lie to save\n\nour own skins\n And when it comes to telling lies, the evidence has revealed\n\n<,> that perhaps Mr Jack has more experience than all of us 1", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

second defendants\n\n\nalleges a struggle a fight but this case is not about a fight nor as\n\nit is struggle\n My Lord that he acted in\n\nself-defence, therefore the main issue for consideration today is whether\n\nthe defendant acted in self-defence, and if in fact he did whether    his action was done with reasonable force that's a\n\nrequirement for the elements of self-defence,\n\n\nyou a different story\n Mr Thomas will be carried to a hospital only to be\n\nawakened as the <unclear> words</unclear>  once/was the defendant who\n\nmay stand in with no injuries My Lord\n Mr Thomas is a professional music artist\n He's known as Rastfael for his electrifying performances\n lyrics\n There's a message in music which speaks of a hardship's faced by\n\nthe poor and oppressed\n Through music he warns about the ills of leading a violent life\n He's inspired by the great Bob Marley our reggae icon\n The evidence today will show that Mr Thomas uses the peaceful\n\nlyrics of Robert Mr Marley as a dialogue and  often chance especially\n\nin situations in which he faces oppression\n He's not aggressive My Lord he's not violent rather he's a default\n\nRastafarai who  once dedicated his life to non-violent resistance\n\nagainst injustices\n his\n\npopularity increased both locally and international\n for international\n\nrecognition as a re-knowed reggae artist, worldwide,\n\n\nduly incorporated under the laws of Jamaica, the Companies Act in\n\nparticular\n Its offices are at six Bellevue Drive Kingston\n The second defendant is and was at all material times employed as a\n\nsecurity guard, stationed at <unclear> word</unclear> News\n\n\n moving into the complex, the <unclear> word</unclear> News My\n\nLord<,> Mr Thomas was insulted by Mrs Priscilla Allouf<,> a neighbour    whom he has neither seen or spoken to\n\nbefore\n He immediately recognizes the discrimination which informed her\n\nconduct\n The following day, a similar type of behaviour was manifested by\n\nthe second defendant\n Again, my client has never seen or spoken to this gentlemen\n\nsorry My Lord he would have seen him but  they've never spoken before\n The claimant will tell you about the faithful day on January twelve\n\ntwo thousand and one\n He was in his backyard practising for an upcoming U S tour when the\n\ndefendant and Mrs Allouf trespassed onto his property\n This unlawful entry resulted in the second defendant battering the\n\nclaimant with a lawful excuse and with unreasonable force\n My Lord at the end of this case we asked that a rule is in

{'text': "<$A>  to\n\nmake its closing argument\n My Lord it has been said that self-defence is injust as is law\n that instincts avail when\n\na man has been attacked he will react to protect his person\n My Lord the soul issue for determination in this case is whether\n\nJohn Keepsafe intended to defend himself and in so doing whether he used\n\nreasonable force\n My Lord from the evidence four things have become clear, that the\n\nclaimant  suffer an aggressive nature My Lord and that he has a\n\npropensity for violence, that the claimant  has a preconceived\n\nnotion and he was being discriminated against, that the claimant's\n\nwitnesses are inconsistent and they are unreliable and lastly My Lord that is\n\nbecause of the aggressive nature of the claimant his propensity for violence\n\nand his preconceived notion that he was being discriminated against which\n\ncaused him to react more aggressively in the circumstances\n the\n\nclaimant's aggressive nature\n My Lord there are two clear instances where his aggression comes to\n\nthe fore\n In the first instance when Mrs Allouf went next- door to inform him\n\nthat he was causing a disturbance\n My Lord the claimant would have us believe that he was a\n\nconsiderable neighbour when he told us that he was  building a studio\n\nso that he would not disturb his neighbourhood\n But do not be fooled My Lord\n That admission only makes it clear that the claimant knew that\n\npractising outside would cause a disturbance but he did it anyway\n He made an assumption\n My Lord Mrs Allouf merely went to inform him that his assumption\n\nwas wrong, that he was causing a disturbance\n My Lord there was no need for discrimination on the parts of Mrs\n\nAllouf\n She simply wanted peace and quiet on the twelfth of January two\n\nthousand and one\n My Lord the claimant saw this as a confrontation, a situation\n\nwhere he had to assert his right, rights which no one questioned My Lord\n He had a chip on his shoulder\n In the second instance My Lord when the defendant saw him as he was\n\nexiting the complex he told him of the complaint lanced against him by Mrs\n\nAllouf\n\n\nthat the claimant verbally assaulted him, told him to  fear how\n\n<unclear> words</unclear> like in a war\n My Lord the claimant has said that he was trying to send Mr\n\nKeepsafe a non-violent message but My Lord these words aren't friendly\n words of\n\npeace those are words of aggression\n My Lord Mr Keepsafe did not threaten the claimant\n Doing so would cause him to lose his job, a job which he had for\n\nthree years, a job which  was a source of income\n over a\n\nclaimant who had just been in the premises  \n\n for less than a month\n Further than that My Lord I would advise you to take into account\n\nthe fact that other than this complaint there had been no other complaint by\n\nthe residents of the complex against Mr Keepsafe and the residents include\n\nRastafarai My Lord\n But as the aggressor the protest nurses he detested the fact that\n\nhe was being asked to conform to rules, he was being asked    he was being corrected  that day My Lord\n We invite you My Lord if it pleases you to consider it was more\n\nlikely than not that he was the one that issued the threat and on the twelfth\n\nof January two thousand and one he was the one that attacked Mr Keepsafe in\n\nfulfilment of that threat\n My Lord the claimants had a preconceived belief that he was being\n\ndiscriminated against and that caused him to react more aggressively in the\n\ncircumstances\n Having moved into the complex for most of the, well what he said\n\na half and half ghetto, the claimant perceived that he was being looked on\n\nupon\n his rights to live in the\n\nneighbourhood\n My Lord it was also his testimony that he was trying to send a\n\nnon-violent message, so<,> the defendant that  he was a part of\n\nthe system that was discriminated against him that was holding him \n\ndown\n My Lord Mr Keepsafe has testified that he did not discriminate\n\nagainst the claimant\n His unfounded belief that he was being discriminated against caused\n\nhim to react more aggressively\n It is likely therefore My Lord that on the twelfth of January two\n\nthousand and one he was the one that issued the threat, he was the one\n\nthat attacked Mr Keepsafe\n Let's turn to the inconsistencies My Lord in the claimant's states\n he\n\ndidn't hit so hard that he fell to the ground\n My Lord we saw doctor Gugut today\n\n\ndetailed reports    in his examination of\n\nthat <unclear> word</unclear> of the patient\n My Lord if the claimant was hit so hard in his knees would you\n\nexpect to see some evidence of abrasion or traumas in his knees\n There is no such evidence in the doctor's report My Lord\n There is no such evidence My Lord because the claimant's account of\n\nthe story is fabricated\n My Lord on the day in question the claimant's evidence is that he\n\nwas rehearsing\n the claimant\n\nwas vicious and  infatuated/infracted when he saw Mrs Allouf\n\nand Mr Keepsafe    on his premises in\n\nhis witness statement he testified that that was the last drop\n He lost it therefore My Lord\n My Lord he would have us believe that only minutes before having\n\nbeen so  hight up from his rehearsal he suddenly cooled off to have a\n\nnon-lyrical as he said a non-lyrical violent  face-off from fifteen\n\nfeet away when suddenly in front of him Milord was a part of the system that\n\nwas discriminated against him\n My Lord it does not add up\n Given his state of mind at the time, his propensity to violence\n\n<,> his aggressive nature it stands to reason that he was the one who\n\nattacked Mr Keepsafe and that Mr Keepsafe had to act in self-defence\n My Lord the Defence called Mrs Allouf\n My Lord Mrs Allouf is a reliable witness as she was on the premises\n\nfrom the beginning\n\n\nwrd  she saw Rastfael performing and she smelled ganja,\n\nshe saw the  redness in his eyes, she saw how  anger/angry\n\nRastfael was when he saw them on his premises\n\n\nrushed towards them with the microphone raised\n, the police\n\n\nwords</unclear> did she know it\n My Lord she might not have seen since she left immediately but My\n\nLord I submit that having seen the claimant rushing towards them with    microphones unraised it is not likely the\n\nclaimant would have stopped in mid-air or in    mid-\n\nway the attack it is likely that the attack continued and therefore\n\nMr Thomas attacked Mr Keepsafe\n Compare this to the evidence of Ms Wilson who was called by the\n\nclaimant My Lord\n She can't be trusted for two reasons\n She's bias and her evidence is inconsistent\n My Lord she has testified that she thinks her boyfriend deserves\n\njustice<,> she has testified that she feels cheated, My Lord and she would\n\ndo anything to see that he gets justice\n She doesn't want to see him suffer\n\n\nhe cannot do what he used to do\n She has said so herself\n of her capacities to make up life\n\nto ensure that he gets justice but My Lord justice is truth in action and \n\n  since Ms Wilson's story's\n\nfabricated she wants to be  denied\n Ms Wilson did not see what transferred between Rastfael and Mr\n\nThomas because she was inside\n She said she went inside to turn down the music\n My Lord she's not omnipresent she cannot be in two places at the\n\nsame time\n when she went inside to\n\nturn on the music and return outside there must have been a lapse of time\n\nbetween those two periods My Lord\n\n\ngiven  and given the power to command time to stand still\n that Rastfael did not stand happily\n\non his side waiting for her to come back for the confrontation to continue\n\n\n  went inside she saw the two men facing each other\n If she went inside when the two men were facing each other My Lord\n\n   and time did not stand still she cannot give an\n\naccount of what transferred\n She said that she saw a struggle My Lord\n We're not disputing that there's a struggle\n My Lord, since we're not disputing that there's a struggle our\n\nevidence cannot help us because    she did not see who inflicted the first blow or whether\n\nMr Keepsafe was acting in self- defence\n She also testified that she saw battery and she went in the middle\n\nof it pushed them away she intercepted these two strong men\n she must be, she can stop\n\ntime and she can run in the middle of two strong men  \n\n when a battery was going on\n And she did that without injuring\n My Lord let's turn to reasonable force\n In the circumstances Mr Keepsafe on his belief that his life was in\n\ndanger\n\n\nthis does not  down play the fact that there was imminent\n\ndanger\n It is lucky for him therefore that he had his training to rely on\n He testified that he inflicted two blows to the claimant\n\n\n  which we have to examinate to determine\n\nwhether he acted in self-defence\n Mr Keepsafe's\n\ntestimony is that the claimant was rehearsing\n in\n\nhis rehearsing\n\n\ncould not be described at that time as a calm person\n Secondly My Lord Mr Keepsafe described the eyes of the claimant\n He said that they were red, with fury because he was angry\n My Lord only a day before Mr Keepsafe was told to fear for war he\n\nhad  <- > receives threat  received threats from the\n\nclaimant\n\n\nreceived complaints of ganja smoking the day of the incident being\n\none of them\n Upon entering the premises he was suddenly attacked\n the fact that Mr\n\nKeepsafe is a trained security guard, trained to use a baton to defend\n\nhimself, and others<,> it was the only thing that he had in sight\n My Lord you've seen the microphone\n It is made of heavy metal\n to weigh to\n\nfind detail what <unclear> word</unclear> he would have taken\n He had to take steps to protect himself in the circumstances\n Doctor Dugut today has testified My Lord that those injuries\n\nsustained by Rastfael    were consistent with\n\ntwo blows of the baton\n\n\nfight them  find that Mr Keepsafe was in imminent danger and\n\nhe was reasonable forced in the circumstances toward of this danger posed to\n\nhim by Rastfael, and as Mr Keepsafe apprehended a battery <unclear>\n\nword</unclear> we also invite you My Lord if it pleases you to award damages\n\nto Mr Keepsafe on the consequence", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL',

{'text': "<$A>  Thank you My Lord\n My Lord, we the claimant submit that there are really only two\n\nmain issues to be examined in this case discrimination, and self-\n\ndefence<,,>\n My Lord this is indeed unfortunate\n It's unfortunate that my client is different, that he earned his\n\nmoney in an unconventional way and that he did not fit the status    of what the defendant and Mrs Allouf felt  <- >\n\n  was the ideal, resident for <unclear>\n\nwords</unclear>\n Let us first speak about Mrs Allouf\n She testified herself in court today that she was angered, and\n\nthat she was upset at the presence of Mr, Thomas\n that she disliked him\n her neighbour she does not like him\n\nfor the neighbourhood\n My Lord we submitted that she was the instigator actually in this\n\nmatter, when she continued to over and over again complain about my\n\nclient's  noises and disturbances to the defendant and when\n\nshe actually went and sought the defendant to have a \n\ndiscussion My Lord with my client\n Assuming that this was a discussion My Lord she would have had this\n\ndiscussion herself\n Let's move to the defendant\n He testified that he liked his job, that he was very good at\n\nhitting them can be committed for it\n was familiar with\n\nwho Rastfael was\n My Lord it is likely that the defendant himself didn't like the\n\nfact  ,  that Mr Thomas\n\nwas now living in that neighbourhood because he was biased he was\n\nbiased against my client he thought my client was a trouble-maker\n\n\nword</unclear>  News he had never had  built with anyone like\n\nthat before\n So of course it must have worried him if he felt you know he's a\n\nworried you know that this would affect his job and how he will be able to\n\nconduct his usual duties and so on and so on\n\n\ndiscriminating against my client was that he's human he didn't appreciate\n\n<unclear> words</unclear> Mr Thomas responded to him the first time he spoke\n\nto him about the matter\n And as such, his, offence or his being offended affected the\n\n<unclear> word</unclear> he had interacted with the defendant after that\n Our client gave evidence that he started to lapse on his duties he\n\nwould not do things such as  allow Mrs Allouf <unclear>\n\nword/words</unclear> at the gate\n These are all indices of a discrimination My Lord that my client\n\nhas faced\n\n\nwords</unclear> and that he would have to  deal with him\n my\n\nclient because my client did not respond  too favourable to\n\nhim\n\n\n as a result   of all of this and the discrimination, that all\n\nthe things  manifest itself and combinated then to the actual assault\n\nthat is the matter at hand today\n My Lord we ask that you find the second defendant did in fact\n\ndiscriminate against Daniel Thomas we ask you to find also that Mrs Allouf\n\ndid also discriminate against my client,\n My client is a D J My Lord and the issue of ganja smoke came up\n\nnumerous times today in trial\n However he's a Rastafarian and he told us that he's a practising\n\nRastafarian and that, the smoking of  the holy herb as he\n\nput it is part of his spiritual rituals\n\n\nin the privacy of his own home probably a part of his ritual as well,\n And generally it is known that, the effect of herb tends not to\n\nbe that to hyper things but actually to mellow people\n So it's highly unlikely My Lord that when the Defence argued that\n\nmy client was smoking and that he was  hyper and angered that that was\n\nso if in fact they were right about him smoking weed,\n My Lord he submits that, the defendant did not appreciate,\n\nhaving a man in the complex smoking weed    and\n\nnot  being apologizing for it\n Hence another reason My Lord to discriminate against my client\n Now My Lord if you find for discrimination in this matter you will\n\nfind that this    links to the next issue at hand\n\nthat of self-defence My Lord\n submit My Lord that this discrimination by the\n\ndefendant escalated to an attack on Daniel Thomas by himself and we also \n\n  further submit that the issue of self-\n\ndefence really does not arise in this case\n the defendant was not acting in\n\nself-defence but that he attacked my client\n actually there are\n\nessential elements of self-defence that are missing from this case\n\n<,> the first being the apprehension of fair\n Mr Keepsafe said over and over again in his evidence that he was\n\nnot afraid\n I wasn't\n\nafraid making it clear that there was no apprehension of fair,\n Secondly who struck the first blow\n Not my client\n The defendant struck the first blow, and he did not just strike\n\none but over and over until my client fell to the floor and then he continued\n\nto hit my client until my client was rendered unconscious\n He said himself that he's a trained security guard trained to\n\nrestraining but he did not use any of his training\n My Lord, it is clear that, the attack on my client could not\n\namount to a restraint he was irresponsible in his actions,\n He continuously beats Mr Thomas, with enough force to render him\n\nunconscious and to leave him paralysed,\n The doctor gave evidence My Lord of the amount of force that would\n\nhave had to be necessary to inflict this injury\n He said it would have to have been severe, and at the lower\n\nparts of the spine for such an injury to have been received\n Mr Keepsafe in his evidence says that he struck the defendant to\n\nhis upper back\n This is inconsistent with his injuries My Lord,\n Doctor Dugut also gave evidence that if such an injury were to be\n\ninflicted it would have been inflicted from behind,\n My Lord hitting someone from behind does not amount to self-defence\n We submit My Lord that when the defendant hit Daniel Thomas it was\n\nwithout lawful reason,\n My Lord the next element of self-defence that of reasonable force\n The force exerted by the defendant today was clearly unreasonable\n\nMy Lord in the circumstances\n It was also not proportionate\n Daniel Thomas was not violent he was only using words\n Words cannot kill My Lord\n He said he was not afraid and words alone could not have made him\n\nfear for his life\n Nevertheless, he hit my client,\n We therefore submit that this attack was not by any means possible\n\n <- > proportionat  proportionate to that of chanting or\n\nsinging words or songs,\n My Lord not only did the defendant hit my client but he hit my\n\nclient with such force to render him paralysed paralysed for life my client\n\nwill never again be able to walk, which is a clear indication of the\n\nintent with each force or with each blow that the defendant had when he hit\n\nmy client\n Not the actions of a trained security guard trained to restrain\n My Lord we ask that you find that the defendant was not acting in\n\nself-defence but instead attacked Daniel Thomas in the morning of January\n\ntwelfth two thousand and one,\n In respect of the counter-claim My Lord that the defendant has made\n\nthey obviously have not displayed or given any evidence to that \n\nrespect\n As a counter-claim the Defence is claiming that he was also\n\nassaulted while the key witness of assault is the apprehension of fair\n I go back to Mr Keepsafe's evidence, he did not apprehend fair\n\nhe said it again and again  I was not afraid,\n Therefore there was no assault,\n And Mr Keepsafe is all in one piece, without a scratch\n There is no evidence of any damage to his person or otherwise\n Where was his assault\n My Lord we submit that this counter- claim has failed\n We ask that your Lordship find for the claimant in this claim and\n\nthe counter-claim and we ask My Lord that an award of damages, an interest\n\n<,> costs, be granted, to my client\n so pleases those\n\nare my submissions\n\n\n\n<$A>  The clothes got discarded Ladies and Gentlemen, Ms Gentle\n\nsaid that\n The clothes got discarded\n Why not the expensive gifts that he used to give you all throughout\n\nthe year\n The clothes went Ladies and Gentlemen because Ms Gentle knew that\n\ninvestigation from the police    would\n\nneed her clothes to be examined and her clothes would prove nothing\n If she was so violently raped her clothes would be ripped, but\n\nshe threw away the clothes which would be perhaps the only proof    that she had to show that she was\n\nraped\n Mr Jack apologised for hurting her, and he said very clearly\n\nthat he meant emotional hurt not physical <unclear> word</unclear>\n He was sorry for breaking her heart\n Being the caring and thoughtful man he was, who was aware of the\n\nthings that they went through together, he knew that the break-off would\n\nbe difficult for her to handle and the roses and the gift card  were\n\nsignals of the closure and compassion\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\nchara  character not the power-hungry possessive man that\n\nthe Prosecution has strived to  taise him at\n Ladies of all the witnesses here today no one knew him better than\n\nMs Faithful and   , as she said, yes she\n\nworked for Mr Jack for a number of years but she clearly showed that, she\n\ndoes so by choice, not necessity\n\n\n if Mr Jack fired her tomorrow she'd be alright\n A threat from Mr Jack would do nothing to her\n So unlike Ms Envy who was brought here to support the evidence of\n\nMs Gentle Ms, Faithful is much more credible\n to admit that initially he\n\nlied a colleague constable Mighty about sex\n Do not let that make you lose sight of the bigger picture because\n\none as her Ladyship would tell you a lie in itself is not evidence of guilt\n\nbut a defendant may lie for an innocent reason and two, notice that Mr\n\nJack did not need any encouragement to tell the truth, he did so on his\n\nown\n the\n\nevidence brought by the Prosecution is at best extremely weak\n Ms Envy can't be trusted, the only thing deductably sure about\n\nis that she was sexually active, and  <,>  Ms\n\nOnvy as I said she could not be trusted and  <,>  the police officer's evidence helps our case\n\nactually because she showed that Mr Jack fully cooperated with the police\n\nwhen faced with the allegations\n her\n\nbehaviour before after and on May eighteenth negates the allegation that she\n\nwas raped\n how Ms Onvy\n\nsaid she described the incident to her <unclear> word</unclear>, \n\nHm, he raped me\n That sounds alike a really destruct woman\n Ms Gentle wanted to\n\nget back at Mr Jack for hurting her and breaking her heart, but\n\ntill she knew that to hurt a rich successful bank manager she had to come\n\ngood, she had to hit hard\n\n\nexplanation perhaps, rape an allegation of rape\n Mr Jack\n\nis a victim  in conclusion Mr Jack is a victim of a bitter\n\nemotional woman  scorned from a broken- heartedness, and a greedy\n\nmalicious woman who saw    the opportunity to help\n\nher friend\n\n\nan offence grave as rape, because of the Envy-Gentle  typed\n\nteam\n after\n\nthis his good to  repentation/reputation is scarred\n He made a mistake, he had mistakes\n Do not allow him to suffer any more unnecessary punishment\n Return a verdict of not guilty so that he can go home to the

in Prime Time Sports on Friday that Clarendon had withdrawn from the\n\nDa Costa Cup because two of their players who also play for the Jamaica on\n\nthe seventeenth did not meet the eighty percent

{'text': "<$A>  Good evening and welcome to News Watch\n I am Irving Forbes\n Top stories today\n The nation's leaders attend a special service for peace and unity\n Private sector pumps assistance into blood collection effort\n And in sports tonight both Barbados and Guyana confident of victory\n\nin tomorrow's Red Stripe Bowl final\n\n\n<$A>  Welcome back now for the details\n Today marked another national show of cooperation and its\n\ntogetherness while Jamaica's two main political leaders the Prime Minister\n\nand opposition leader attended a service for peace and national unity at the\n\nChapel of the Northern Caribbean University in Manchester\n The leaders have invited all Jamaicans to join them this weekend\n\nfor special prayer in the face of an awesome challenge from violence\n\n<$B>  Cabinet and party officials of the P N P mainly arrived on\n\nfirst followed by members of the J L P leadership\n The chapel filled to capacity and spilt outside the congregation\n\nalso including representatives from the private sector trade union movement\n\nand other sectors of civil society\n The two leaders were seated side by side\n\n<$C>  We have not come to watch our leaders pray\n Several people have called since yesterday\n They even called the radio station\n What do you think is going to happen after the leaders have prayed\n It is not only the leaders who have come today to pray\n to pray\n\n<$B>  The service was divided into three sections focusing on\n\nconfession supplication and restoration\n Among other things the congregationals reminded that national sin\n\ndemand national repentance\n Bishop Carmen Stuart moderated the first session which included the\n\nprayer of confession\n\n<$B>  During the third session the two leaders were invited to the\n\naltar where several ministers present prayed for them\n That service marked the first of two special days of prayer for\n\npeace and unity and were thus designated by a proclamation from the\n\ngovernment alone\n The initiative was backed by a joint statement from the Prime\n\nMinister and the opposition leader pledging their personal commitment to\n\neliminating violence and restoring peace\n reaction in the service\n\n<$D>  This will be followed up by services at the constituency level\n\n<unclear> words</unclear>to give a sign that it is not only at the level of\n\nthe national leadership but it must also percolate down to the national\n\nleadership and the community leadership so that peace can be restored to our\n\nland\n\n<$E>  We can hardly predict, one will only expect but the next\n\nstep will be better than the last steps\n\n<$D>  Can you elaborate then what you mean by the last step\n\n<$E>  Well so far we still have a lot of ground to cover to achieve\n\nwhat is the objective and that is peace\n We hope that certain things that we already set in motion various\n\ncommittees and so on will be truthful and find solutions that can help us to\n\nachieve that peace\n\n<$A>  In their joint statement the two leaders acknowledged that\n\nprayer is not a substitute for action but that the country needs divine\n\nguidance to confront crime and violence\n The private sector has decided to throw its support behind the\n\nnational blood transfusion service in its blood collection drive\n its\n\nblood collection campaign yesterday with at least six other companies\n\npledging their support\n The programme will run from October to December\n Robert Rea has the videos\n\n<$F> The\n\nmain objective is to dramatically increase of stocks of blood at the blood\n\nbank\n\n<$F>  Officials from the Ministry of Health say the recent upsurge\n\nin violence in the corporate area has brought the blood situation to crisis\n\nproportion\n The daily need for blood island-wide is about three hundred units\n About half this amount has been collected\n and a team from the blood\n\ntransfusion centre this is an extremely strong factor\n\n<$G>  What we have to be doing is going out to the people reaching\n\nout to the people on the mobile\n\n\n to donate blood\n\n<$F>  The experts say that one unit of blood can save as many as six\n\nlives\n Probably about one hundred and twenty lives were saved as a result\n\nof  blood collection launching drive\n says it's the first time that the private\n\nsector has shown a real interest in helping the campaign\n\n<$G>  to put on the marketing\n\nprocedures that we need to put in aid with to get people interested and\n\nreally to get the private sector in on this\n To us is really a wish come true\n\n<$F>  Many people are scared to give blood for various reasons but\n\nthe number one being contracting H I V\n But health officials say there is no way one can get H I V just by\n\ngiving blood\n\n<$H>  I think it's important because there is clearly a drive for\n\nmore blood and I don't think that people take the initiative very very\n\nseriously\n\n\ntwo-or-three-words</unclear> and I think the more people that participate to\n\nthe blood donation programme the more blood hospitals have and the more they\n\n can give it people who need it\n\n<$F>  Blood is\n\nprecious\n to give this\n\nChristmasRobert Rea C V M News\n\n<$A>  worried about the\n\ndangers created by a deep corner in the community\n They say over the years accidents have happened frequently at the\n\ncorner which overlooks a precipice\n There's a wall along the road but it doesn't go all the way around\n\nthe corner and it's cracking in some places\n The last accident reportedly took place last Tuesday when a car\n\nskidded during rainfall and overturned at the corner\n Five children were injured in one of the accidents at the corner\n\nwhich occurred in April this year\n\n<$A>  Residents say there used to be a sign warning of the double\n\nbend but it's no longer there\n Heritage week activities in Westmoreland are in full swing under\n\nthe theme  Heroes and unsung heroes of national development\n The heritage week library display was one of the high points of the\n\nweek\n The display was attended by hundreds of specialist school children\n\nfrom the parish\n High school Heather Morris\n\nsays it's important for our youth to know the nation's unsung heroes like\n\nMary Seacole St William Grand George Headley and Bob Marley\n\n<$J>  You and I are the unsung heroes of Westmoreland\n Why\n we're suffering\n\non\n These ordinary everyday people are the people who keep our parish\n\ngoing\n The retired teacher the teacher who is there day in and day out and\n\ngoing back and when a child comes along today they find the lost money and\n\nwhen the person died they are in district and they write the eulogy and they\n\nprepare the song and they're there day in and day out for those children\n Those are the unsung heroes of Westmoreland\n\n<$A>  And that's where we approach Heroes Day on the focus on our\n\nheritage\n One financial institution Union Bank has again sought to contribute\n\nto cultural awareness\n The bank has staged a cultural competition among its branches\n\nculminating next Tuesday\n The event involves cultural presentations including musical items\n\nartefacts and exhibitions with pictures of the national heroes as well as\n\nvarious people to show our cultural diversity\n\n<$A>  The exhibitions were meant to promote comradery among staff\n\nand ensure appreciation for customers\n And Union Bank plans to stage similar activities during other\n\nseasons\n

Stripe Ball cricket final at Kaiser in St.\n\nAnn between Guyana and Barbados\n Guyana were hoping for their second hold on the trophy while\n\nBarbados were looking forward to holding it for the first time\n\n<$H>  Barbados didn't look like they would get it from early on when\n\nthey lost Adrian Griffith after just nine runs\n And the flight continued when they lost Dale Richards the fourth\n\nman on the seventy-nine runs were on the board\n But then came Hendy Bryan and Ryan Hinds to repair the damage\n Bryan gets the sixth here because Liam McGarrell fortunately\n\ntouches the rope<,>\n The runs continued\n Bryan got to his half century but didn't stick around much after\n\ngoing for fifty-seven to Sewnarine Chattergoon\n But only after that seventy-nine one fifth wicket rescue act with\n\nHinds who was now joined by Courtney Browne\n Browne gets it good for six\n Hinds went on to his fifty\n And the pair stayed together to the end of the Bajan innings of two\n\nhundred and twenty-one for five<,>\n Hinds was right back at the Guyanese of their turn and the crease\n Hinds took out open at Chattergoon early\n But it did take some time before Guyana lost another wicket\n out\n\nsome    ninety-nine runs later\n Here he gets fall on his way to a well played fifty-four\n\n\nma  in his match winning innings of eighty\n But it was the skipper Carl Hooper himself who had the pleasure of\n\nscoring the winning runs<,> a boundary to end it\n Guyana are Red Stripe Bowl champions for the second time\n They defeated Barbados by six wickets\n Final scores Barbados two twenty-one for five Guyana two hundred\n\nand twenty-three for four<,,>\n South Africa easily defeated Kenya by nine wickets on Sunday in\n\ntheir triangular series match in Kimberly\n who both scored\n\nhalf century scores to their Kenyan fifth wicket record stand of a hundred\n\nand six to help the visitors to two hundred and twenty-nine for seven which\n\nby the way is their

city starting at Jamaica House\n Linton McKenzie who had already won three races this season\n\nquickly assumed his position at the front and never looked back except for\n\nthat one time in the closing stages when the <unclear> word</unclear> Phillip\n\nEdwards made a charge\n But the forty-one year old McKenzie found an extra gear as they\n\nsay and pulled away to win in one hour fourteen

{'text': "<$A>  Good evening and welcome to News Watch Sunday\n I'm Michael Price\n Minister of Education and Culture Burchell Whiteman is expressing\n\ngreat concern for schools which withhold student certificates and other\n\nevidence of success in external examinations because they have not paid the\n\nrelevant fees to the school\n Speaking at an award ceremony for principals and vice principals in\n\nWestmoreland late last week he had strong words for those who are guilty\n Lydia Thomson reports\n\n<$B>  The Education Minister was in fact taking his word of caution\n\nto the schools which engage in this practice\n While not giving a figure he said the problem is fairly widespread\n\nand must cease\n\n<$C> \nI'm\n\nnot a census yet\n\n\n to cease\n\n<$B>  Clear advice from the Attorney General he says is that it is\n\nillegal which would imply that a student can take legal action should a\n\nschool refuse to supply the results due to what it terms a delinquency\n For his part the purpose is neither moral nor judicious as the\n\nquarrel for fees is with the parent and not with the student\n He points to cases where schools have large bank accounts and are\n\nstill refusing to allow students to access what they need\n Education for success he notes must be the guiding principle\n\n<$C>  that we as administrators and\n\npeople responsible for the facilitation of youth<,> will be proud about our\n\nbank account proud about what we're able to do in terms of new equipment and\n\nnew facilities and an improvement of the environment but ended up frustrating\n\na few and sometimes more than a few individuals who feel that  <- >\n\ntheirall their effort has been<,> frustrated because of\n\nsomething for which they themselves are not personally and directly\n\nresponsible\n\n<$B>  Mr Whiteman says there is widespread frustration relating to\n\nthe issue\n While not making any commitment to closing any budgetary gaps for\n\nschools he noted that if a particular group of parents have not paid its fees\n\nand the school is experiencing a shortfall as a result then the matter should\n\nbe directive to the Ministry\n\n<$C>  you which\n\nwillwill make it impossible for you to function then the\n\ndiscussion must be with the Ministry of Education\n It can't be with the student who has taken an exam and is waiting\n\non his results to move forward\n It cannot be\n That is immoral okay\n\n<$B>  President of the Jamaica Teachers Association Paul Adams also\n\nspeaking at the function said the association is providing support for\n\nteachers and ultimately pupils in inner city communities hard hit by violence\n One such seminar directed by Doctor Peter Weller was conducted last\n\nweek and another is planned for another

English-speaking Caribbean will\n\ncontribute just over fifty percent of the four point five million U S dollar\n\nCARICOM subscription\n At the meeting the CARICOM Heads of Governments also agreed to hold\n\na special tourism summit in Nassau  from November\n\neight to nine<,>\n While efforts have been made to assist the traditional tourist\n\nsector following the fallout from the September eleven tragedy in the United\n\nStates not much has been done to help those who are directly connected to\n\nthis sector\n That's the word from president of the Saint Ann chamber of commerce\n\nAndrew Grant\n In an interview with C V M News he explained that car rental\n\nagencies taxi operators and craft vendors have also been adversely affected\n\nand they too need some form of assistance\n\n<$D>  to\n\ntheto make sure these other parts of the business community\n\nare also included uhm so that we can work ourselves out of the present\n\nproblems that we have\n\n<$A>  Jamaica's former

from the region\n Three of the suicide terrorists killed in the September eleven U S\n\ntragedy were in the Bahamas in May\n This disclosure came from Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham who said\n\ntwo of

from formal\n\ntraining<,,>\n but I knew\n\nhe was a philosopher that came of from and for the masses of Jamaican\n\npeople<,,>\n from a popular\n\nJamaican world view<,,>\n That world view was an interpretation of the narrative of the\n\nBible<,,>\n Particularly its account of the struggles of the people in the\n\nBible for their own home and their own national identity<,,>\n\n\nthe displaced

interpretations practices and\n\nbeliefs<,,>\n In the spirit of the sixties someone like Peter seems to me to have\n\ngrown naturally into Rastafari<,>  uh particularly the more militant\n\nnaturalist and nationalist sections of Rastafari<,,>\n\n And of course he was best known for his campaign to legalise\n\n ganja but he was the bush doctor<,> because of his deep\n\nconvictions in the natural

{'text': "<$A>  On setting about preparing this presentation it occurred to me\n\nthat the first thing I needed to do was identify and pull together all of Sir\n\nPhilip's published poems\n Most of us have heard that he was also a poet\n And many people have at least heard of one or two of his poems in\n\nparticular  Jamaican Fisherman and  Pocomania\n\nwhich have been quite often anthologised\n But the closest thing there has ever been to a collection of his\n\npoems was a chapbook of ten poems and that was the title  Ten\n\nPoems published in British Guyana in nineteen fifty-three in the\n\nminiature poet series put out by that indefatigable voluntary agent and\n\nmidwife for West Indian poetry in the forties and fifties himself a\n\npioneering West Indian poet A J Seymour\n As you can imagine in the nature of publishing and distribution and\n\nreadership in the West Indies in nineteen fifty-three Sherlock's little book\n\n Ten Poems would have already been a rare item from the very\n\nmoment of its publication<,>\n Sir Philip never had many poems published\n published between\n\nnineteen thirty-nine and nineteen sixty in addition to the much later long\n\npoem entitled  Shout for Freedom a tribute to Sam Sharp\n\npublished in nineteen seventy-six\n It is on the earlier short poems that his reputation stands at least\n\nup to now\n I haven't found out yet how many unpublished poems there are\n\n\nthere were    any but he did quote from one\n\nunpublished poem otherwise unpublished entitled  The land of look\n\nbehind in his keynote address to a symposium on law and society\n\n Abolition and after held at the Norman Manley Law School in\n\nOctober nineteen eighty-four\n Although the output was so small it was distinguished\n For one thing he was a more than competent craftsman in\n\nverse\n Among the seventeen poems there is an appreciable range of subject\n\nmatter and a remarkable variety of style and mode and music from the\n\ndignifiedly celebratory modulations of iambic pentameter in  Jamaican\n\nFisherman to the evocation the suggestion of African Caribbean\n\nrhythms in  Pocomania and  Paradise to the\n\nsatirical ironic urbanity of drawing room talk in  Dinner\n\nParty nineteen forty\n Now having to take a comprehensive look at these poems these few\n\npoems in order to make this presentation I realise now even more clearly than\n\nbefore how much they were a part a significant part of the poetic movement of\n\nthe nineteen forties and fifties which was\n\nfostered by Edna Manley's magazine  Focus\n\n\nFocus and there was not one of the four issues of \n\nFocus beginning in nineteen forty-three and ending in nineteen sixty\n\nthat did not carry at least one Sherlock poem\n But more than this because that's only figures the nexus of\n\ninterests whether stylistic or thematic represented by the poems complement\n\nparallel and extend those of the  Focus group as a whole and I\n\nthink some of you know who they were\n A concern for the peasant and the urban working\n\nclass a belief in the capacity of the so-called\n\nordinary people for struggle and self-improvement<,> a visionary symbolic\n\nrepresentation of nature and of the homely<,> a quasi-religious sense of\n\nexhilaration in the imminent dawning of a new day a new Jamaica as \n\nThe welfare song said\n a new day of political\n\nfreedom and national achievement these are some of the characteristic\n\nfeatures of the group and of Sir Philip's poetry\n Take for instance the poem which first appeared under the title\n\n Just Poem in  Focus nineteen forty-eight and\n\nthose republished with its first line as its title  Clear as the clear\n\nsun's light in the little book  Ten Poems in nineteen\n\nfifty-three\n The poem takes the Gordon Town landscape which as you know has\n\nalways held a certain mystique for some people for a lot of us I should say\n It seems to have some special even other worldly quality about it\n\nand animates the landscape with an elemental visionary symbolism in a kind of\n\nmetamorphosis that builds to a state of ecstasy and epiphany\n The landscape is depicted eventually in the poem as burning with a\n\nfire that you know it catches fire that energises\n\nilluminates and transfigures but does not consume the landscape\n The black rocks twist and rise and run red with the\n\nblood-red light of the sun\n The fire has claimed its ancient place the fire which slept within\n\nthe rock the fire which slept within the earth the fire that slept has come\n\nto birth and seals with flame the shaking earth\n There are no people mentioned in the poem\n And there is no mention in the poem of George William Gordon who is\n\nconnected with Gordon Town\n But knowing Sherlock and given the context of the poem and the time\n\none might feel that in it nature has become pure symbol of human possibility\n\na possibility inspired by the presence<,> of\n\nGordon the presence in quotes of Gordon\n But in the few minutes I have left I'd like to focus on one feature\n\nof Sherlock's poetry its concern for the African Caribbean people its\n\nrecognition of their history of struggle and their capacity for resistance to\n\noppression its recognition of the beauty and dignity of black people\n In this regard these poems exemplify the new development in the\n\npoetic consciousness of the forties and fifties alongside some of the work of\n\npeople like George Campbell Eric Roach of Tobago and William S Arthur of\n\nBarbados\n In this regard too the poems are evidence of a consistency and\n\nintegrity in Sir Philip's view of things Caribbean\n This consciousness and concern reached a sort of culmination at the\n\nend of his life in the story of the Jamaican people co- authored with Hazel\n\nBennett\n I'm not here to do an assessment of that work\n not an official\n\nhistorian and that is not anyway part of my brief\n But suffice it to say that this book and even more so some of those\n\narticles he wrote for the Jamaica Observer in his late days had some people\n\nsome of you maybe some of those people had some people wondering in a kind of\n\nwhispered bemusement\n How come he had now discovered his blackness and wasn't he a bit\n\nlong in the tooth to be sounding so zealous and even revolutionary\n all those years to do\n\nso<,> however liberal and progressive he was wasn't he still a high\n\nbrown establishment Jamaican<,> diplomat quote\n\nunquote rather than politician or freedom fighter\n One response may be simply who are we to judge\n But it may be that his voice took on a sharper more desperately\n\nurgent note about these matters as time slipped away from him\n\n\nma  may have taken a stronger line from earlier\n\n\nthe other day was consistent with the one in whose poem  At\n\nascension  Focus nineteen fifty-six quote  Four\n\nmen stripped to the waste were mending the road black bodies gleaming with\n\nsweat moving earth by the shovelfull beside a bank where cactus grew and red\n\nhibiscus flamed\n We can note in passing the symbolic overtones and possibilities of\n\nthe cactus and the red hibiscus\n This the person who wrote this was consistent too with the Sherlock\n\nwhose black fisherman had made his first authoritative appearance in the\n\n Extramural Reporter a mimeograph journal put out by Sir\n\nPhilip's extramural department way back in February nineteen fifty-four\n first\n\nappeared to take its place in the story of West Indian poetry beside the\n\nburnished beauty of A J Vaughan's  Revelation beside Geoffrey\n\nDrayton's  Negro Divers and George Campbell's  Negro\n\nAroused\n\n This how it starts\n Across the sand I saw black man's tribe to fetch his\n\nfishing gear and broken things and silently that splendid body cried its\n\nproud descent from ancient chiefs and kings\n Of course there is a bit of rhetorical excess in the last two lines\n\nbut the movement is well modulated and the striding fisherman was an\n\nepiphanic flash of black light for the time\n One might wish now that the figure had not needed the prop of royal\n\nlineage in order to affirm his personhood\n The poet's liberal humanism if we may call it that is still the\n\nproduct of his time and his upbringing\n He constructs the fisherman as a version of the noble savage as an\n\ninnocent\n Across the sands I saw him naked stride sang his black body\n\nto the sun's white light the velvet coolness of dark forests wide the\n\nblackness of the jungle's starless night nor knew how fiercely spoke his body\n\nthen of ancient wealth and savage regal men\n I have it on good authority although I have not been able to locate\n\nthe documentary evidence that Sir Philip later revised the poem getting rid\n\nof savage for one thing but is good author   \n\nuh it would make an interesting point\n\n understood or came to realise Sir\n\nPhilip well enough that however much he may have been in the vanguard of his\n\ntime he was also as we all are<,> a creature of his time constrained by his\n\nnurturing\n In an interview he did with me between December in nineteen\n\neighty-two and February in nineteen eighty-three he said and I wanna quote a\n\nlittle of this interview\n I don't think any of this part of it has been published ever\n I think my story is very much the same as the story that\n\nyou would get from say a man like Hugh Springer who was born and bred in\n\nBarbados\n Naturally in my reading in my father's study and then at Callabar\n\npractically all the books were devoted to the United Kingdom England British\n\nheroes westward hoe with Drake and the rest of it\n The poetry that I loved and still love the poetry of Shakespeare\n\nMilton Wordsworth Tennyson and so on again it's all English literature\n And this was alright\n And in the temper of the times we accepted the fact that we were\n\ncolonials without question I think most of us\n End of quote\n And he went on to say that in hindsight he could see that Marcus\n\nGarvey was quote  a decisive influence on him\n I quote again\n It wasn't so much that Garvey was preaching West Indian\n\nnationalism as that he was saying to the black people not only of the\n\nCaribbean but really of the United States and the world  You have a\n\nhistory you have a history of which you should be proud and you should know\n\nyour history and you should know the accomplishments of the heroes in that\n\nhistory\n End of quote\n And a particularly decisive moment occurred for Sir Philip when as\n\na young teacher at Callabar in the early nineteen twenties I think he stood\n\nin the great crowd that phrases his phrase from the interview on Habour\n\nStreet watching the parade of sailors and nurses who would come off Garvey's\n\nblack star lion ship\n Quote\n Here were people who were dedicated to the idea that\n\nblackness had merit to it and had beauty to it\n I think that kind of opened my eyes to the inner meaning of what\n\nGarvey was saying\n I don't mean completely because it takes quite a long time to break\n\nthrough the inherited prejudices and attitudes\n You know this isn't a thing that happens quickly but I would say it\n\nwas the beginning of the process for me\n And again finally from the quotation\n and I\n\nwas sort of  and I was sort of lower middle class and at first\n\nI thought that this was a form of heresy", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '10b15fd3-23bb-45a8-af29-9bc2f01dd48a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:52.418601+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': "<$A>  Folks I proudly come to you not as an academic but an\n\nelementary  school- marm\n Growing up methodist in Jamaica the names etched in your\n\nconsciousness were the brothers John and Charles Wesley followed by the\n\nbrothers Hugh and Philip Sherlock\n I was predisposed to loving them all\n\n\nHugh who was minding my soul and Philip who was refining my mind\n At an age when a grown man should have put away childish things\n\nPhilip the parson's son was writing nancy story\n And almost sixty years later Philip the queen's knight bachelor was\n\nstill romping with Anancy and his cohorts\n Philip Sherlock plumped the Anancy lore\n lore\n He played with the legend of three finger Jack and all of this while\n\nmaking his mark on Caribbean society and beyond while chiselling steadily on\n\nthe granite that was to be his legacy\n He bestowed validity and legitimacy on a figure of trickery and\n\nthievery with a wife named Crooky\n For the people of delicate sensibilities who had regarded Anancy\n\nand his antics as a blight on the Caribbean psyche Sherlock had destroyed any\n\nhopes of the spider-man's demise in the ashes of\n\namnesia\n Time does not allow me to review the whole folklore canon and so I\n\nam presenting an abridged version that focuses on the magnum opus \n\nWest Indian Folk Tales and its effect on one little part of the world\n\noutside of the Caribbean\n\n\n was published in nineteen\n\nsixty- six\n And when I arrived in Toronto in nineteen sixty-seven every school\n\nlibrary boasted a copy or two and very often that book was the sole\n\nrepresentative of anything West Indian\n The text became a classroom staple especially during black history\n\nseason\n Yes I say season because it started out as black history week and\n\nlater grew into one whole month all be it the shortest month of the\n\nyear\n For that brief span of time virtually every classroom had a picture\n\nof Martin Luther King Junior a picture of Malcolm X and a drawing adapted\n\nfrom the comic book  Spider- Man to represent\n\nAnancy\n By the time Sir Philip himself visited Toronto in nineteen\n\neighty-nine the Anancy stories were so well known and loved that he received\n\nrock star adulation at an assembly of students eager to regale him with one\n\nor another of the stories\n To digress for a while I will tell you that this visit allowed him\n\nto spend some time with one of his all time favourite people Slade Hopkins\n And for both men the pleasure was palpable\n being with Sir Philip had provided him\n\nwith the spiritual elixir that had been a long time lacking\n Sherlock deliberately wrote his Caribbean folk tales in Standard\n\nEnglish for wider accessibility\n But one school librarian took issue with that\n She was in my continuing education class at the University of\n\nToronto and I had just completed the module on Creole when she commented that\n\nSherlock's Anancy stories would have sounded more authentic if he had written\n\nit in Creole\n But it was not a problem for her since she often rephrased them in\n\nCreole\n so you\n\nknow Creole well enough to tell story in it\n And with a smug smile of satisfaction she informed me that her\n\nboyfriend was Jamaican\n But right now right now we are on the outs and she titter-totters\n\nher hand to dramatise for me the meaning of outs\n At assignment time the woman informs me that she has elected to\n\ntranslate one of the Sherlock folk tales into Creole\n And with great munificence she's planning to run a copy for\n\neveryone in the class\n Over the next three days she called me six times to spell a word or\n\nvalidate a phrase\n After six I let her know that this was to be her work not a\n\ncollaboration with me\n Time to hand it in and the lady appears with hand in\n\nsling\n oh Maud you're not going\n\nto believe it but this is what happened\n My boyfriend came over to help me and at one point he began to talk\n\nand walk and act like Anancy\n And I laughed so hard that I fell off the chair and hurt my arm\n\nhence the sling\n The room exploded with laughter\n But she was ready for us\n You can laugh all you want but he is going with me to\n\nJamaica for the winter break\n I could only muse to myself poor Sir Philip just wanted to preserve\n\nfor posterity but this woman is using him to create that\n\nposterity\n Needless to say I never got a paper and she never got a\n\nmark\n Sherlock was well aware that his is not the definitive version of\n\nany of the folk tales for wherever there are people to tell them\n\nembellishments and hyperbole will always add more lustre to the tale\n It was story time in my grade seven classroom and I decided to\n\nbreak out an Anancy story from Sherlock's  West Indian Folk\n\nTales\n I chose one of the Anancy tiger conflicts and was less than half\n\nway into it when Prudence A K A Miss P began fidgeting in such a way that I\n\nwould be forced to stop and ask what was bothering her\n She begged me to allow her to tell the story to finish the story\n\nfor she knew it good good good\n Well Miss P did me proud\n And at the end she told her captive classmates that every Anancy\n\nstory must and bound to have a song\n And this is the song that belong to this story when Anancy was\n\ncoming down riding on the back of tiger\n Then she asked the class if they wanted to sing with her\n Forget me I'm not there\n Of course they wanted to and so they did\n Most of it\n I asked her at recess time why she hadn't allowed them to sing all\n\nof it\n She thought for a moment then asked in a most conspiratorial sotto\n\nvoce\n I can tell\n\nyou something\n And I reverted to eager snoop what what what\n\n\nshe learn  just a  wappen- bappen\n\nhm\n\n So she was guarding her heritage and I was getting a basic lesson\n\nin <unclear> word</unclear> teached to the inability of the\n\nclass\n Socrates is shuddering as we speak\n Sherlock the historian is never far from Sherlock the story-teller\n\nthe scribal griot\n And so the folk tales of the Caribbean cannot begin with Anancy\n Recognition must be given to the rich lore of the people who\n\npredated Anancy's arrival\n The Carib tales as I call them explain the how and whyness of\n\nthings as is the want of folk fables the world over\n Our waddies hands sculpture of a dog from a fish left dog with a\n\ncold nose and gave us the lovely simile as cold as a puppy nose\n\nhole\n Men and animals lived at one time in good friendship until the\n\nmischief maker  Ereweka caused the flood and the loss of trust between\n\nman and beast\n Not like the biblical account where the rainbow bespeaks the\n\npromise of reconciliation\n the monkey gives way to mischief\n\nitself in the form of Anancy\n Africa moves\n\nacross the Atlantic to the islands of the Caribbean and the Ashanti\n\npeople transport and transplant the spider-man\n In the new home of the Caribbean Anancy has to con as in cunning\n\nhis way to the top\n At that time Tiger was the undisputed lord of the forest\n He displayed on matched strength and inspired such awe that things\n\nwere named in his honour Tiger moth Tiger Lily among others\n Today we have the lovely oxymoron tiger shrimp\n Anancy on the other hand was the puniest of the puny with nothing\n\nto commend him but burning ambition that could be better translated as\n\ngrudgefulness\n But by playing on the gullibility naivety and vanity of those who\n\nunderestimated him he gained the ascendancy and the right of eponymy to the\n\nstories\n I suppose he figured that Anancy's stories would have a more\n\nalluring and intriguing cachet than tiger's stories\n Yes for Sherlock history is story and story is history\n It is black history month once again and I decided not to tell\n\nanother Anancy story but to tell the story of the Arawak and Carib people\n\nknowing full well that I would find no finer source than that provided in the\n\nintroduction of  West Indian Folk Tales\n In the introduction Sir Philip traces the northward migration of\n\nthe Arawaks and Caribs from South America to settle in the islands of the\n\nAntillean archipelago\n And after years of traditional life the people get a rude awakening\n\nas Columbus and his pussy<,> step on the shore fall on their knees and\n\nJudasly kiss the ground\n I came to the paragraph\n This was the first meeting this was the first\n\nmeeting  this was the first meeting between the old world of\n\nAmerica and the old world of Europe\n The two groups faced each other on the sandy beach\n Naked brown-skinned men with weapons of stones and shells and white\n\nmen from Europe clad in armour with weapons of iron\n The class is wrapped but not wanting to mistake open-eyed sleep for\n\na deep interest I stop and ask\n\n And before I can elaborate on the question there comes a grunt\n\npregnant with doom\n Mhm I me no se wan a dem gwan\n\nfene\n My recently arrived Jamaican boy has spoken and I am\n\ntorn\n Do I run over and kiss this child or do I tend to the twenty-five\n\npairs of eyes looking to me for explanation\n You see\n\n was never a drawing room word but it also was\n\nnever a faulty shillinger\n Okay\n you grow with you\n\ngranny\n To which he replied\n No me mudder granny but Miss don't is true that one\n\nof dem gwan and

{'text': "<$A>  Now the issue of reparations for slavery is one which has\n\nattracted the attention of a number of<,> civil rights lawyers in the United\n\nStates and a number of trial lawyers in the United States in addition to\n\nother countries\n Uhm right now for example there is what is called a reparations\n\nassessment group which comprises uh a number    of high profile lawyers uhm<,> and their uh<,>\n\nobjective really is to<,> do an assessment of the compensation which<,> is\n\nsupposed to be paid to<,> ex-slaves or the descendants of ex-slaves in the\n\nDiaspora<,>\n Now this group includes the likes of uh Johnny Cochrane of O J fame\n\nand uh other lawyers who are<,> uh said to be from the million dollar club\n\nmeaning that uhm in their experiences as trial lawyers they have uhm secured\n\nvictories in settlements uh over a million dollars\n Uhm now against this background it would seem that what I am about\n\nto do here to determine whether there is a legal basis for reparations is\n\nrather a given<,> right\n But I think that it's uh a question which has to be looked at\n\nbecause uh from the standpoint of positive law as against natural law which\n\nis to say uh the law as is as opposed to what it ought to be or the law as it\n\nthen was as opposed to what it ought to have been\n Uhm there are a number of difficulties in terms of moving forward\n\n   with such a claim\n claim uh for reparations on the\n\nbasis of positive law uh can either be brought under the basis of domestic\n\nlaw or international law<,>\n\n\ny  turning to domestic law   \n\nthere're a number of difficulties with that\n Uhm there is first of all the limitation statutes\n Now these statutes provide that uhm within a certain time a claim\n\nmust be brought\n countries following the\n\nEnglish jurisprudence will have between one and six years during which such a\n\nclaim has to be brought for a civil wrong\n uh it would be very difficult to surmount\n\nuh this kind of problem unless of course one were to have uh uh some change\n\nin the law uhm as was done with respect to uh the claim by Japanese Americans\n\nuhm which culminated    in the Civil Liberties Act of\n\nnineteen eighty-eight\n the second uh issue uh with respect to this of course\n\nis that uhm uh one may uh<,> uh uh speak of a claim on the basis of unjust\n\nenrichment and this is certainly one of the things that uhm uh Randall\n\nRobinson of trans- Africa suggested in his book  The debt what America\n\nowes to Blacks uh that in fact a claim can be brought on that basis\n Uh basically what this says is that uhm the law will not allow\n\nbenefits    to a defendant if that defendant\n\nprofited from some civil wrong uh uh meeted it out to the plaintiff<,>\n\n\n as opposed to strict law as it were and there are some problems\n\nin relation to that as well because even though strictly speaking the statute\n\nof limitations would not be a bar for an equitable claim   \n\nwhere they wanted to go with international law\n\n not saying that there was\n\nnever any uh international action on the part of states to uh proscribe\n\nslavery or the slave trade\n In fact there're several bilateral and uh multilateral treaties in\n\nthe nineteenth century which uh reflected the desire of the then powers to uh\n\nrestrict or proscribe slavery\n congress\n\nof Vienna in eighteen fifteen the second treaty of Paris in eighteen fifteen\n\nuhm the    uh congress of Verona in eighteen\n\ntwenty-two\n Uh but these were declarations against uh the slave trade in\n\nparticular<,> and uh these declarations provided for uh    their coming into effect uhm upon the promulgation of\n\ndomestic laws in these particular countries and certainly in relation to uhm\n\nthe<,> declarations during that period\n It was not until eighteen thirty-one that uh France and Britain in\n\nparticular<,> uh decided to put in some measure to give effect to these\n\ndeclarations that is to say to allow for uhm search and seizure    of vessels involved    uh\n\nin the slave trade\n But by eighteen fifty-five uhm this particular treaty uhm expired\n were left with uh a number of\n\nbilateral treaties which simply did not have    the\n\nkind of effect in terms of    proscribing\n\n   the slave trade\n\n\nnineteen twenty-six slave convention which uh sought to uh restrict or\n\nproscribe slavery and the slave trade uh but    the\n\nproblem with the nineteen twenty-six slave convention is that uhm again it\n\nwas not declaratory of international law it was simply exhorting the parties\n\nto the convention to do certain things\n And the thing with international law is that one has to determine\n\nwhether uh a convention    as it is adopted\n\nis declaratory of international law    or whether it\n\nis intended to uhm have the parties to the convention do certain things which\n\nover time will crystallise in international law\n And I take the view that the nineteen twenty-six slavery convention\n\ncan be seen in that light uh so too the nineteen fifty-six slavery convention\n\nthe very same thing\n In fact uh while we're having uh this argument about the Nuremburg\n\ntribunal saying that slavery is uhm a breach of international law and so on\n this was uhm in nineteen forty-five\n In nineteen fifty-six the ten member committee set up to determine\n\nwhat provisions should be included in the nineteen fifty-six supplementary\n\nslavery convention were in disagreement as to whether slavery should be\n\nabolished progressively or immediately\n the U S S R and from Egypt took the\n\nview that a progressive elimination of slavery would be contrary to the\n\nprovisions of the U N charter uh\n Britain surprisingly took the position that slavery was such an\n\nentrenched uh custom in so many countries that to remove it would cause\n\ndisorganisation\n So that what was adopted in the fifty-six convention was something\n\nwhich says that each of the parties to the convention shall take all\n\npracticable and legislative and other measures to bring about progressively\n\nand as soon as possible the complete abolition of the following institutions\n\nand practices and all of these things related to slavery and things like\n\nslavery\n international law was still\n\nunclear  positive international law was still unclear as to\n\nthe status of slavery as it related to international law<,>\n and some\n\nwould argue the U N charter\n in terms of interpretation of treaties one may say that\n\npursuant to the uh U N charter of Article One Oh Three that to the extent\n\nthat there is any treaty that is inconsistent with the U N charter then that\n\ntreaty must be subordinated to it\n In other words then the U N charter in so far as it has provisions\n\nsupporting human rights uh subsumed under which would be uh anything that\n\nsupports freedom and anything which is against slavery uhm would trump the\n\nprovisions of any other treaty which would be inconsistent with it\n So that one may take the view that the provisions of the U N\n\ncharter in particular article one which relates to the purposes of it and\n\nthat includes the provisions for human rights and articles fifty-five and\n\nfifty-six would in fact trump the provisions of the twenty-six and fifty-six\n\nuhm slavery convention\n Uhm but even if one were to take that view and of course that is\n\nstill questionable because again if you look at the provisions of the U N\n\ncharter as it relates to human rights one can also argue that uhm those were\n\nexhortations as it were or as they were uh in that<,> there was no\n\ndeclaration that these things were uhm against international law that is\n\nanything    in conflict with the promotion of human\n\nrights and in fact many international lawyers argue that it was not until the\n\nsixties into the seventies that human rights or the promotion of human rights\n\nbecame what is called a peremptory norm in international law\n That is a norm uh from which no derivation is allowed\n\n\nthere is no question of course that by the seventies uhm slavery was\n\nseen as against<,> international law and    the\n\ninternational law with respect to slavery then was seen as a\n\nfundamental norm against which no derivation was allowed<,>\n whether or not even\n\nassuming that the U N charter trumped the twenty-six convention whether one\n\ncould bring a claim on the basis of international law\n it is a well known canon of interpretation of treaties in\n\ninternational law that unless<,> the treaty says that it must be given\n\nretroactive effect it can't be\n And there is nothing in the U N charter neither the uh slavery\n\nconventions of twenty-six or fifty-six which speak to giving retroactive\n\neffect to the provisions therein and so<,> one could not uh uh base a claim\n\non international law on that basis right<,>\n\n\nwhatever we may think about the Nuremburg charter or the uh U N\n\ncharter<,> uh those<,> conventions cannot avail us in terms of bringing a\n\nclaim for as far back as then uh\n Now as it relates to slavery afterwards or contemporary slavery\n\nfine that's okay\n Which means therefore that one has to look at how do we get around\n\nthis particular problem\n and this is\n\nwhat was done with respect to the claim by the uh uh uh  \n\n the Japanese Americans and also the Jews who sued  \n\n the  World Jewish Congress uh that brought a suit against\n\na number of uh insurance companies banks and so on in France Italy and other\n\ncountries for what they suffered during the Holocaust", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '072013df-107c-4956-9527-88b516544efe', 'added':

reparation<,>\n My ideological position on the matter now in the public space is not\n\nunique<,>\n Since the arguably unsatisfactory conclusion of the world conference\n\non racism held in Durban<,> the issue of reparation for slavery<,>\n\ncolonialism and genocide against indigenous peoples<,> has attracted\n\nincreased attention<,>\n And more and more the descendants of those who were affected

to outline what I\n\nbelieve<,> are the bases for the support for reparation by some individuals\n\nand groups in the Caribbean<,,>\n\n The region accounted for forty-two percent of the estimated fifteen\n\nmillion Africans<,> forcefully removed from Africa from the fifteenth to the\n\nnineteenth century<,>\n The British-colonized Caribbean accounted for two of the fifteen\n\nmillion<,,>\n Second colonizing activities imposed structural discontinuities\n\nupon the Caribbean<,>\n\n\nand reorganized Caribbean economy to discourage a domestic economic sector<,>\n\nin favor of the export

accounted for seven out of\n\nevery ten<,> transatlantic slaving voyages<,> and carried nearly seventy-five\n\npercent of all captives taken from Africa<,,>\n that the phenomenal\n\nexpansion of world

generally<,> long after the institution was\n\ndeclared illegal in their own countries<,> and long reminded of its\n\ninhumanity by philosophers<,> should adopt reparation<,> if only<,> as an act\n\nof reconciliation\n\n\n\n<$B>  This is a topic that has been on the minds of sectors of the\n\nJamaican population particularly Rastafarians<,,>\n However it has been as Sylvia Winter and others remind us uh in the\n\narea of the marginal is a marginalized topic<,>\n a global\n\ndiscussion<,> and that global discussion however as we all know was eclipsed\n\nby the events of September the eleventh<,>\n The events of September eleventh however should not allow us to\n\nignore what is a fundamental discussion\n understand the magnitude\n\nof the challenge of reparations\n It is for all of us and I hope all of us a learning experience\n It's not a topic on which we can either blow hot and take positions\n It's really is a learning experience\n The Brazilian uh experience and I was glad to hear Robert Gregory\n\nspeak to the four fifty uh huge delegation which indicates uh the extent to\n\nwhich the majority of the Brazilian black population have certainly taken\n\nthat issue on board\n And I attended one of their preparatory meetings uh in December two\n\nthousand and for me it was a learning experience about the repositioning of\n\nblack people in Brazil in the twenty-first century\n So I approach the topic of reparations because it's an ancestral\n\nissue issue that involves my fore-parents<,> uh my ancestors their\n\ndescendants those that I know uh were not necessarily reparations people\n They were people who were way up this experience and who said we\n\n have to make    the best of the world as we\n\nknow it\n Uhm and I think of my grand-parents and so on uh who were aware of\n\ntheir forefathers but felt that we need to put that behind us\n That was what I grew up with\n\n\n grown up with that\n And we now need to just look to the future\n Why have I take issue with those of my ancestors because I think uh\n\nwe're missing out on important principle of restorative justice\n Restorative justice in my view in terms of dignity respect and\n\nsocial and economic change<,>\n is\n\nto deal with the damage done to Africa and the Diaspora over many generations\n Wherever while making the case for reparations we also have to be\n\nself-critical about our own exercise of sovereignty\n reparations is\n\nthat when these territories came to discuss and negotiate independence nobody\n\nexcept marginalized groups raised the question of compensation\n They went to London they took what they got\n No issue of history no issue of principle was raised\n We were therefore a people who were worse than mentally enslaved\n\nbecause we didn't even know that there was something outside of the mental\n\ncolonial formation\n There is something that was concern of Garvey and later concern of\n\nuhm uh Bob Marley in his musics\n So the movements for rectification led by Garvey led by Rasta those\n\nmovements were on the uh margins\n is that in\n\naddition to what Robert Gregory has said about the fact that this  /}>  don't wanna raise reparations issue they want to put a\n\nclosure to the debate on reparations\n That is to say after Durban let me hear no more discussion of\n\nreparations\n\n\nthe debate for each generation in order to have an understanding of the\n\nfactors that have shaped us in so many ways economically socially politically\n\nour ideas or values the things that we mouth on a day to day basis what we\n\ngot as common sense\n All of that has been shaped by an experience that we have very\n\nlittle idea as to what that experience really meant not a Jamaican experience\n\nbut an experience that is across the Atlantic\n That's the experience about which I speak\n One of the problems with the nationalist history that we have all\n\ngrown upon is that it telescoped that wide experience in the Atlantic into\n\nsmall nations state experience\n So slavery revolts became revolts that were geared towards the\n\nindependence of St Kitts or Barbados or Jamaica\n When in fact many of the people who revolted never had any notion\n\nof any independence\n They had other notions which we are not sufficiently aware of\n So the debate from a learning point of view from the standpoint of\n\nhow we come to grips with our future this history becomes important\n On the issue of reparations one of the things that I think we need\n\nto get rid of is to link any notion of financial reparations to the twenty\n\nmillion pounds or the twenty million pounds was just one moment in eighteen\n\nthirty-four", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$A>  Uh I'd just like to share with you my own experiences as a\n\nmember of the Jamaican delegation to the third world conference against\n\nracism racial discrimination xenophobia and related intolerance\n Now this is my first time participating in what's known as a\n\nnegotiating conference\n\n\na  a number of regional prep cons\n Uhm one in Latin America and the Caribbean ours for our region was\n\nactually held in Chile and comprised all  <- > the  the\n\nnations    of this hemisphere\n Asia another in\n\nAfrica uh and of course one in Europe\n And so the collective two documents a draft declaration and a draft\n\nuhm programme of action compiled from these prep cons was what greeted us in\n\nSouth Africa\n And both these documents comprise of about over two hundred and\n\nfifty paragraphs all of which had to be negotiated\n the\n\nlead up to the conference there was a lot of concern voiced by the\n\nUnited States regarding the<,> references made to Israel and the equating of\n\nactions of the Israeli government uhm in current times with regard to their\n\nrelationships with the Palestinians uhm equating it    uhm\n\nto genocide\n\n\ntook great exception to that and uhm succeeded uhm in the first days\n\nof the conference expunging all reference to Israel in this kind of light\n\nfrom both the draft declaration and the draft programme of action\n\n We had huge delegations from all over the world but it was\n\ninteresting to note that uhm the delegations from the Western hemisphere were\n\nI think the most vociferous uhm and came    with\n\nhuge expectations myself included uhm there was a delegation of about four\n\nhundred and fifty persons from Brazil mainly Afro- Brazilians uhm\n\n\nm  members uhm participating in the N G O uh conference\n\nwhich is a conference    operating almost at\n\nthe same time frame as    the main conference\n\n\nAsia and I must mention uhm a group referred to commonly as the untouchables\n Uhm I did not really appreciate the plight of these persons but\n\nthis conference being a conference against racism and racial discrimination\n\nand xenophobia and related intolerance of course covered all ills uhm which\n\nmade our attempts to distinguish our issues which is basically the\n\ntransatlantic slave trade uhm very difficult\n first of all after\n\nthe conference opening were uhm<,> faced with    a\n\nnumber of presentations\n Our delegation made its presentation all the countries\n\nparticipating and  there's a hundred and eighty-odd countries\n\nparticipating in the conference and I'd just like to read to you briefly uhm\n\nthe presentation made by the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Foreign\n\nAffairs which represented Jamaica's position\n Uhm just excerpts from it\n At the onset let me extend congratulations and express\n\nappreciation to the government of South Africa for hosting this third world\n\nconference against racism racial discrimination xenophobia and related\n\nintolerance and for the excellent arrangements made for our comfort and for\n\nour deliberations\n The symbolism of the venue is overpowering\n South Africa which so far so long has been a symbol of racial\n\noppression and injustice is now liberated after a long and victorious\n\nstruggle\n This result was not just a triumph for the people of South Africa\n\nit was also a victory for multilateralism and a vindication of the commitment\n\nand support given by the international community over the years in the long\n\ncampaign against the system of apartheid\n Mister President the struggle must go on as new forms and old\n\nmanifestations of racism and related intolerance continue to present\n\nchallenges\n We see in different parts of the world racist attitudes and\n\npractices which promote violence and suffering strife human potential and\n\nendanger peace\n They undermine social cohesion and the enjoyment of human rights\n This clearly requires of us that we remain united and strong in our\n\nprinciples\n Whatever may be the psychological social or economic causes racism\n\nand racial discrimination should find no place in human society\n It should be exposed in all its forms and manifestations wherever\n\nit may be found\n The search should not be confined to place or time\n We should look not only in the present but reach into the past\n Mister President the legacy of the past is important not only in\n\nexplaining the persistence of certain patterns of racism and racial\n\ndiscrimination but also in showing the scale and consequences of the damage\n\ninflicted\n The most outstanding example affected Africa and its Diaspora in\n\nthe Caribbean and in the Americas\n We speak of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade that\n\ncontinued over three centuries\n It is well established that many individuals and companies made\n\nsubstantial fortunes and participating countries were enriched and\n\nstrengthened by the exploitation of this trade in human misery\n But the important thing now is not to catalogue the abuses or to\n\nhighlight the human suffering endured during the era but to point the way to\n\nreconciliation and atonement\n The proposals related to reparation that have been made to this\n\nconference are directed toward this purpose\n This proposal not only intended to be divisive or confrontational\n\nbut rather form part of a process to heal the wounds of the past\n Indeed we believe that reparations equally serve the interest of\n\nthe descendants of the victims as well as the descendants of the oppressors\n a means by which both may be\n\nable to confront the past without guilt or bitterness and    we drew a continuous reference to    the truth and reconciliation\n\ntechnology of South Africa coz we thought it was really instructive\n\nfor us and we thought that being in South Africa being in Durban that it\n\nmight have been adopted but no such luck \n It would be a landmark achievement for this conference to adopt an\n\nendorsement of reparations in relation to slavery and the transatlantic slave\n\ntrade\n The international community could proceed by way of two forms of\n\naction\n First there should be a declaration that slavery and the\n\ntransatlantic slave trade was a crime against humanity\n an\n\nexplicit admission of responsibility in relation to the historical\n\nand moral issue and an open and strong condemnation of the grave injustice\n\nand violation of the rights of people of Africa\n It would set the record straight in the context of universally\n\naccepted principles and provide a common judgement on a historical phenomena\n\nof fundamental importance in shaping the modern world\n In the second place there should be economic measures in the form\n\nof policies and programmes at the international level that seek to remedy the\n\nnegative consequences of the historic injustice<,> the destabilisation and\n\nunderdevelopment of Africa and to the degradation and psychic damage of the\n\npeople of the Diaspora\n What is important now is for the world community to accept the\n\nprinciple of    equity compensating policies\n\nwhich can be applied to improve the development prospects of affected\n\ncountries\n Within this framework a number of possible initiatives could be\n\nmore specifically identified in relation to the trade arrangements O D A debt\n\nrelief resettlement grants or special programmes for the development of human\n\nresources\n This conference could take these important steps now clearing a\n\nmajor hurdle and laying the basis on the long term for better understanding\n\ngood will and cooperation\n At the same time it could provide the basis for more effective\n\npartnership within the global community in the promotion of economic\n\ncooperation poverty reduction for social development\n All of this is made more critical in the light of the ongoing\n\nprocess of globalisation and the expanded international uh    mobility which is part of the dynamics of that process\n Increased contact between peoples of diverse culture and racial\n\ngroupings    emphasises the need\n\nfor attitude and values of tolerance non discrimination   \n\nand appreciation of the value of diversity\n It goes on but I think you get the basic drift of our presentation\n Let me just add a few things\n racism is still very sensitive\n What we got to understand and I've never been exposed to this again\n\nmy first experience of a negotiating conference\n At the prep cons the lesser developed countries of the world were\n\ntold in Geneva that final prep con that it is not in their interest to\n\nsupport reparations\n They were told and they were told straight that supportive\n\nreparations if it does come to pass will mean that the moneys that will be\n\npaid for reparations will come from the little aid money that they're\n\nreceiving currently\n It is not in their interest to support it\n And that was told point blank\n I couldn't believe it\n The second part of it was that when the U S pulled out the European\n\nUnion took its place\n we do\n\nnot  we do not accept the notion of race\n We do not accept the notion of race\n Race is a social construct we don't accept it\n\n fine this was not our construct\n Somebody decided that this is the Chinese race and this is the\n\nAfrican race and this is the European race and proceeded to designate the\n\nAfrican race as a race suitable for slavery\n\n\nthere's no race\n\n And so it went\n But they stonewalled on it and continued this particular posture\n\npreventing any further discussion so  wherever mention was made in\n\nboth the declaration or in the uh programme of action of race African race it\n\nwas struck\n us with a\n\nreal challenge of moving forward\n And that's why the deadlock up until the very end of the conference\n So racism is still very sensitive\n This notion of reparations equals money for the Negroes also posed\n\na real difficulty for us\n We were saying reparation was not about money reparation is about\n\nrepairing and we put forward that the first thing to be done because we\n\nrecognised that the transatlantic slave trade really was the origin of\n\nAfrican racism<,>\n Along with that was all kinds of supporting myths and dogma\n The Brazilian contingent said that during the fifteen hundreds and\n\nfourteen hundreds the Catholic Church preached that Black people had no souls\n Remember slavery was abolished in Brazil and Cuba in eighteen\n\neighty-eight\n These kinds of myths supported this dastardly slave trade\n The transatlantic slave trade was chattel slavery\n It made the slaves into things\n And all that followed from that\n There're a number of things that would justify us distinguishing\n\nthe transatlantic slave trade<,> different from other slave trades\n And this point about slavery sort of being treated as a phenomena\n\nand particularly a phenomena of current times to be remedied but not looking\n\nat the transatlantic slave trade the historical   \n\nslave trade and the injustices that came from that because they don't\n\nreally recognise slavery this particular slavery using Africans\n This is the only slave trade that you became a slave because you're\n\nan African and Africans were suitable for slavery\n And all the other supporting structures followed\n\n\na lot of  a lot of challenges\n Uhm the final point I'd like to make is that, you\n\nknow the Palestinians even though they have nothing to\n\ndo with our issue this issue with the Palestinians and the Israelis really\n\novershadowed everything\n\n\nour platform even though we    had some \n\n  successful negotiations with the Africans the L\n\nD Cs came around but the issue of Palestinian and Israel really kind of\n\novershadowed and prevented us from moving forward to our objective of having\n\nthe transatlantic slave trade accepted as a crime against humanity for an\n\napology    to be issued and for the\n\nreparations discussions to begin\n And what we wanted to have in reparations discussion was first of\n\nall for the history books to reflect that this nonsense called African racism\n\noriginated with this slave trade this transatlantic slave trade so that\n\nAfrican children European children I mean there're thousands and millions of\n\nchildren African children born assuming a posture of inferiority<,> thousands\n\nand millions of European children born assuming a posture of superiority and\n\nnot even understanding where it came from\n It originated in this transatlantic slave trade\n And we thought that to correct the history books to reflect that\n\nreality to put to bed this nonsense and to move forward as one human race was\n\nwhat we were really seeking to achieve in the beginning of the discussions\n\nabout reparation\n It was not about money\n It was not about money", 'subdomain':

{'text': '<$A>  Greatness in the backwoods metaphoric construction and the\n\nAdamic role in Claude McKay\'s  Banana Bottom\n And I begin with two quotations one from Derek Walcott and one from\n\nClaude McKay\n From Walcott\n\n And from McKay\n\n by Claude McKay is in the words of\n\nKenneth Ramchand quote  a serene evocation of a loved place\n\nunquote\n McKay\'s celebration of the Jamaican landscape and culture can be\n\nread as an enactment of the Adamic elation experienced in naming the new\n\nworld\n although\n\ndiscussing poetry outlines a vision of post-colonial writing as one that\n\navoids the impulse towards revenge or remorse and instead embraces the\n\npossibilities of Adamic celebration\n Much of the critical attention that has been given to McKay in\n\ngeneral and     Banana\n\nBottom in particular has not established the connection  <- >   between these two writers\n Memory and the Edenic\n\nmyth has traced an Edenic paradigm throughout McKay\'s work and\n\nMichael Staff writes that quote  Jamaica becomes the metaphorical\n\nequivalent of Eden unquote in McKay\'s writings\n explored the metaphoric\n\nframework of  Banana Bottom as an expression of that Edenic\n\nright\n Rupert Lewis and Maureen Warner-Lewis in their sociological reading\n\nof the novel gesture towards this focus when they write quote  McKay\'s\n\nextensive use of similes taken from the rural environment and the way of life\n\nattest to his intense familiarity with the landscape and people\n My reading then intends to the detail this extensive use and to\n\nlocate McKay\'s strategy within the theoretical framework of Walcott\'s notions\n\nabout the artist\n For me McKay\'s imagistic landscape is not just about familiarity\n\nbut also about celebration\n Moreover the celebration does not remain at the level of verbal\n\nreferencing it also includes figurative artistry\n While I cannot argue that McKay the quintessential writer in exile\n\nhas demonstrated Walcott\'s total thesis\n By McKay\'s attention to detail in the literal and cultural\n\nlandscapes of the Jamaican society and his metaphoric patterning he can be\n\nrecognised as one of Walcott\'s Adams\n\n\n  in delineating ideas McKay has exploited the rich\n\nresources of the Jamaican local colour\n Both the literal descriptions and the figurative references\n\ndistinguish the backwoods and that\'s a quote of  Banana Bottom\n\n as a place worthy of note and celebration\n Consequently setting and figuring merge in a double emphasis of\n\nmirror images\n This paper seeks to emphasise McKay\'s figurative exhibition by\n\nrecognising the many references to local trees flowers plants fruits animals\n\ninsects natural surroundings and to native foods and dishes\n may also allow\n\nus to recognise Walcott and McKay as distant relations if not twins in the\n\ntradition of post-colonial orphans who have inherited a new world\n An outline of Walcott\'s general ideas and the nature of McKay\'s\n\nmetaphoric emphases may clarify from early the link I perceive between the\n\ntwo writers\n Walcott rejects the vision of the new world as a place of ruins\n Those writers who envision the post-colonial world in this way\n\nremain for him locked in a lament of a lost world and fail to realise quote\n\n what seems the loss of tradition is its renewal unquote\n Walcott affirms that such writers hanker after the old worlds and\n\nlose sight of the possibilities of the new world\n the Caribbean sensibility is not\n\nmarinated in the past\n It is not exhausted\n unquote\n his\n\nwords allows the new Adam to name things and celebrate quote  what\n\nlittle there is\n is no place of ruins\n His literal description of the landscape conjurs up images of an\n\nEden\n More significantly though he celebrates that landscape and culture\n\nin the literary artefact of his metaphoric architecture\n In this way the landscape is named displayed and celebrated in that\n\npoignant expression of the new Adamic elation\n Attention is drawn to native roots and the celebration of those\n\nroots by McKay\'s naming strategy\n The very central perhaps too obvious plant image associated with\n\nJordan Plant\'s family and other rural folk announces McKay\'s elation with\n\nplace\n\n\n  with the world of flowers and with\n\nrootedness perhaps I should say plants\n can be\n\nread as a novel about the contending values of the peasantry and those of the\n\nemerging middle class\n analysis of the use of imagery\n\nwe realise that the values of the peasant class triumph in the end\n Through imagery McKay implies that folk roots remain grounded and\n\nin spite of attempts at transplanting extensions of the original roots remain\n The metaphor of the plant not only helps to describe the characters\n\nbut embodies the notion of rootedness\n after being quote\n\n deflowered quote  transplanted and transformed\n\nfrom a brown wildling to a decorous cultivated young lady quote \n\ndeliberately chooses to vegetate in the backwoods with a common\n\ndrayman\n Carolyn Cooper hints at the metaphorical enforcement for this theme\n\nwhen she writes that quote  McKay\'s replanting of Bita in \n\nBanana Bottom marks the resolution of the central ideological\n\nconflict of the novel in name and in nature\n The plants who represent the folk thrive and flourish in spite of\n\nthe efforts to sever their roots\n\n\nrooted in the soil\n Bita\'s husband is also associated with plants and\n\npreservation since his name represents that quote  healing plant of\n\nJamaican folk medicine\n Through naming McKay alerts us to the celebration of the folk by\n\nusing plants as an image of the folk and their strong roots\n In describing the characters McKay makes use of the opportunity to\n\nname the variety of plant life in a kind of tribute to the local flora\n Reference to the banana tree is regular and thus underscores the\n\nvalue of the agricultural community\n In attempting to represent the variety of shades of complexion\n\nMcKay invokes the banana tree\n\n Hopping Dick is a thin young man of a banana bark brown colour and\n\nfather Delgado\'s facial skin is likened to the dried banana leaf\n Colour shade and texture are all indicated by reference to the\n\nbanana tree\n\n\ncashew brown complexion the auctioneer at the tea party is a little\n\ntamarind brown man and    aunt Nommy is the\n\ncolour of a young coco plant leaf\n star\n\napple\n Through McKay\'s kaleidoscope of colours the variety of trees are\n\nnamed and celebrated\n surroundings also\n\nprovide valuable references for delineating character\n The distinct characteristics of the local folk are emphasised\n\nthrough imagery\n and Deacon Day for example\n\nare associated with strong well-rooted trees which age with beauty\n Mother\'s Day\'s face is said to be like polished oak and Deacon\n\nDay\'s hands are like fine bits of ancient and well  used ebony\n Squire Gensir\'s helper and Wumba are associated with strength and\n\nphysical toughness when  <- >   McKay compares\n\nthem to the ebony tree\n He was a stout chunk of a man opaque and\n\nheavy as ebony\n a little black\n\nwoman squad and hardened and enured to the tropical climate like a shrubby\n\nebony tree\n Tack Tally\'s sharpness is imaged in the pimento tree\n Rosyanna\'s extending girt is linked to the spreading orange tree\n\nand Squire Gensir and his unholy barreness is quote  like a beautiful\n\nall spice tree that never bears seed\n Trees become a testament of McKay\'s love of the land and the\n\nsplendour of vegetation\n These details of the metaphoric framework give support to\n\nRamchand\'s observations that quote  the characters of  Banana\n\nBottom are rooted in a landscape\n In the jewel reference to character and setting tribute is paid to\n\nboth landscape and people\n McKay extends his tribute to also include the foods born from the\n\ntrees and the local dishes which are made from agricultural produce\n Sweet fruits like the mango and the pineapple are used to represent\n\nexperiences which are very tempting by their inherent attractiveness\n The attractiveness of a woman is specially identified through\n\nreferences to sweet fruits\n eloquent when he speaks of the\n\nqueen of the tea party\n Here right under your unworthy beholding eyeballs is the\n\ncrown for the glory a coco <unclear> name</unclear>    tea meeting the most enjuicing temptation of the\n\nfeelings that human hands can fasten together to water your mouths and\n\nticklish your eating engine\n The use of the metaphor " enjuicing" recalls other\n\nreferences by the author\n A good example is this description of the loads of juicy mangos\n\nsucculent velvety star apples and massive sweets smelling sour sops\n Another sweet fruit analogy can be found in one of the songs at the\n\ntea meeting dance\n Got a girl underneath this girl I ever did find stocky\n\ngirl are the sweetest like a ripe sugar\n\npine\n Again the tempting tantalising sweetness of the fruit becomes a\n\nmetaphor for the woman\'s alluring qualities\n In McKay\'s evocation of his Eden the archetypal apple is replaced\n\nby the fruits of local bearing\n In addition to fruits McKay conjurs up images of well loved local\n\ncuisine to bring to life the expression of happiness that a character\n\ndisplays reference is made to an appealing    sorry\n\nlocal dish\n\'s face was as jolly as a\n\n<unclear> two words</unclear> with  Congo peas and a chunk of salted\n\nbeef\n But the images can also be used to support disparage and commence\n\nas well as in the case of Tack Tally whose face is likened to a big bammy\n Yet this kind of use does not diminish the value of the celebrated\n\ndish\n Instead it acknowledges the existence of these as worthy material\n\nfor metaphoric construction\n The author\'s attention to shades of colour is represented even more\n\nclearly through his fruit and food metaphors and reveals his joint homage to\n\nboth the land\'s offerings and the diversity in ethnic array\n Belle Black in a bellicose mode expresses her disdain for a woman\n\nwhose skin colour allows her special privileges when she describes the\n\nwoman\'s complexion thus   our skin im yellow like a boil\n\npumpkin\n whose\n\nskin is said to possess quote  a velvety indigo black tone like an\n\neggplant unquote\n However the range of the colour scheme is extended when Marse\n\nArthur is said to be as red as a tomato\n While these are more distinct colours the range of brown shades\n\ndemands greater variety and McKay finds easy references in the local uhm\n\nculture\n At one end of the colour continuum the lighter shades could be\n\ndescribed thus\n Their complexion was the colour of a ripe banana peel not a\n\nfine ripe one like those that mature and yellow upon the tree in Jamaica but\n\nrather the kind that is harvested green three quarters fit which becomes a\n\nlittle bruised and blotchy\n At the other end McKay describes it this way\n Bita was black\n To be precise she was a restful colour of dark blooming\n\nbrown\n Other intermediate shades are captured in references to specific\n\nfoods\n The child at the sunny school performance is a little sugar brown\n\ngirl while the wife of a civil servant is described as a pretty honey\n\ncoloured woman\n Colour is associated with positions of privilege or their lack\n\nthereof\n colour\n\nposition is conveyed in the image of the plum\n considered\n\nto be the special plums of the light brown natives\n Politically much could be made of McKay\'s colour scheme in this\n\ntext\n His artistic architecture bears the imprint of his ideological\n\ninvestment with respect to race', 'subdomain':

is\n\nmanufactured from his own experience\n\n It is the sonnet form that McKay appropriates to explore themes of\n\nalienation anger desperation fear longing and hope<,,>\n Using words as weapons McKay explodes and stretches the\n\nrestrictions of the sonnet to address racism that the oppressed groups\n\nexperienced in America in the nineteen twenties<,,>\n The sonnets portray the underlying motif of the black man's\n\nstruggle for selfhood<,> juxtaposed with and within the compressed and\n\nrestricted medium that McKay fashions to create a space<,,>\n\n\n\ncolonizers' language to expose

interesting ways to\n\nresolve issues which move through dramatic moments of exposure denouncement\n\ninversion and encouragement<,,>\n McKay's poetry vibrates under the pressure to reconcile form with\n\ncontent<,>\n Some critics express reservations about McKay's ability to tame his\n\ndefiance and militancy in the somewhat restricted form of the sonnet<,>\n Yet it is the very contradiction between the form and the content\n\nthat makes his works so dramatic<,>\n A burning fuse sputters throughout the sonnets a coiled movement\n\nthat demonstrates the interdependence of the issues under discussion<,>\n Vibrating within each sonnet and connecting each to the other is a\n\nrhythm of revolution<,>\n lies in his ability to contain this\n\nrage in the carefully designed quatrains and

movements of the tightly constructed quatrains<,> uh contribute to\n\nthe pendulum effect that picks up momentum in the following poem<,,>\n\n In this sonnet McKay addresses the lynchers using the

like the sheath of a blossoming\n\nbanana<,>\n close curling like thick fibrous roots gazed\n\nat her own    brown eyes<,> the\n\ninfallible indicators of real human beauty<,>\n Lewis and Lewis

a heavy focus on the flora and cuisine McKay also\n\nincludes the insects animals birds and natural contours of the landscape as\n\npart of his metaphoric framework and I think I have given you enough\n\nexamples<,,>\n this elation\n\nthough<,> can easily translate into romanticism<,,>\n and a\n\nposition of distance<,> the danger is even more obvious<,,>\n\n\n a rage for identity<,,> uhm that sorry  in a rage for\n\nidentity only incoherence<,> or nostalgia will be valued<,>\n That is why he argues that the engagement with history can easily\n\nbecome an act of contrition or recrimination<,>\n the truly tough aesthetic\n\nof the new world<,> neither explains nor forgives history<,>\n It refuses to recognise it as a creative or culpable\n\nforce unquote<,>\n McKay seems to be very conscious of the past without\n\nengaging in a literature of revenge<,,>\n as Walcott argues\n\nis to pretend that one is an Adam<,> and not a new Adam<,,>\n I agree with Walcott that the degraded arrival in the New World\n\nmust be seen as the beginning<,> and perhaps not<,> not the end of our\n\nhistory<,,>\n However he demands too much when he expects that the past of the\n\nold world which has determined the new must be obliterated<,>\n It is clear that Walcott's strong insistence is in response to\n\nthose writers whose literature is quote  marinated in the past\n\nand cannot get beyond\n\n As he McKay embraces his new Adamic role he remains conscious of\n\nthe past<,> and writes against it<,>\n His celebration can be easily read as a response to and an attack\n\non the old world assumptions of the coloniser<,> and some of this we see in\n\nthe early West Indian writer where even images of a foreign landscape are\n\nbeing used to articulate the local

{'text': "<$A>  Good morning\n It's my pleasure this morning to present to you work done by myself\n\nNoah Cole and Rosemary Martin\n This work came out of a discussion that Noah and I have had several\n\nmonths ago probably in October uh last year when we were talking about ethics\n\nintroducing ethics into our curriculum and we realized that we really\n\ncouldn't do that until we began to understand what are the ethical values of\n\nthe people who we are going to be sharing this information with\n decision that we would conduct a study\n when\n\nwe  when we were in the process of developing the\n\nquestionnaire and so on Noah was travelling and were back to inform him with\n\na email and I said to him you know this is going to be really, really\n\ninteresting\n So uhm I think it is\n I think we have done some interesting work and I want to share with\n\nyou with just the explanation that this is very preliminary\n We didn't actually get back all our data until January so I'm just\n\ngoing to give you early findings and then have you comment on them<,,>\n And Rosemary Martin was our very capable and helpful research\n\nassistant<,,>\n\n\nfactors that are    fifty-seven per cent said yes we have a code of\n\nethics<,> and thirteen per cent said no\n This what very interesting is that thirty per cent almost one third\n\nof the sample were not sure about whether or not their organisation had a\n\ncode of ethics\n So of course this raises issues of visibility of this code of\n\nethics<,> that we'll discuss a little bit later on<,,>\n\n twenty-one per\n\ncent under five years<,> twenty-five point four ten to twenty years<,> and\n\nessentially this is a fairly well distributed sample ranging from no work\n\nexperience to people with over twenty years of work experience\n the\n\nvariables\n Ethics and religion\n Please remember as you look at these scores that the lower the\n\nscore the more ethical<,> the uhm behaviour is\n And we would have anticipated as we said earlier that the religious\n\npeople who also attended church often or very often would be more ethical\n\nthan those who did not and uhm<,> our results kind of surprised us in not\n\nreally adhering to that\n only the\n\none highlighted in red  I will talk about why in a little bit only the\n\none highlighted in red is actually statistically significant but the\n\ntrend is<,> somewhat surprising\n\n\nare  are more inclined to<,> uhm\n\nsay that they would cheat the government say on taxes<,> circumvent due\n\nprocess in the case of dismissal\n\n\nfind out legal way of dismissing somebody because the manager didn't click\n\nwith that person\n\n they could accept\n\na personal  would they accept a personal gift which was very\n\nvaluable from the supplier\n This was the case of a purchasing manager\n Sacrifice personal values of truth telling in favour of\n\norganisational loyalty\n This was the one I already mentioned for the H R manager and\n\ndiscriminate on the basis of religion\n This one I think was the most surprising to us that religious\n\npeople would have uhm said this\n Uh this was one where the manager of the firm had said not to hire\n\nany Seventh Day Adventists I think it was and uhm we would have expected that\n\nuh religious people would have said but you know that's a no no but<,> again\n\nthis did not work out the way we had expected<,>\n What about the whole issue of youth\n Again the ones in red are the ones that are statistically\n\nsignificant and we had anticipated that if you were younger    you were going to probably have a score less ethical\n\nthan someone who was older<,,>\n And as we look at the scores uhm we see that there is some kind of\n\nsupport for this\n In fact what we found was that uhm youths were less ethical than\n\ntheir elders on all counts except with respect to the issue of discrimination\n\non religious grounds\n This is the one with the Seventh Day Adventists and the hiring\n Youth were significantly more likely to be unethical in respect of\n\ncircumventing due process in dismissal\n Youth were significantly less ethical in relation to the youths of\n\ntheir positions as employees to build their personal businesses\n\n\ncoughing-in- audiencefirm and then used their contacts to set up a\n\nsupermarket<,> uhm<,> you know which was indirect competition with one of the\n\nfirm's businesses\n Making political contributions in an effort to secure contracts\n\nlater on stealing of software and there was no significant    difference in respect to the other issues<,,>\n\n We expected that if you were raised in the urban area you'd be less\n\nethical and again only one    uh statistically\n\nsignificant result the whole issue of stealing of software<,,>\n Uhm ethics and gender\n Women are they more ethical than men\n\n\n  position in company to build own business and\n\nthe other one was stealing of software\n But again we can see the trend that it appears that women may be\n\n   uh slightly more ethical than men<,,>\n What are our preliminary thoughts\n The religion one as we said is a little bit surprising because we\n\nwould have anticipated otherwise but I found a very nice quote from<,> or\n\ndescription from someone called Rousseau who wrote in nineteen ninety-four\n\nabout Christianity and business", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL',

{'text': '<$A>  O K good morning\n Uhm I\'m certainly the outsider here this morning\n shareholders and\n\nbubbles\n what what\n\nwhat  what is our view of the workplace well I would like to\n\nlook at the workplace as    the centre of\n\nlinguistic interaction<,> right\n the levels of linguistic\n\ninteraction in the workplace is the negotiation and    I\'ll like to exploit    the\n\nnegotiation as the<,> uhm as a conflict   <- > of \n\nof ethics then\n my paper examines some of the ethical issues such as bluffing\n\nbribing and uhm blackmailing which arise in the context   \n\nof business negotiation\n Uhm it considers the importance of the language to the negotiation\n\nas well as the language varieties specifically Jamaican Standard English and\n\nJamaican Creole to the projection of issues such as good faith uhm\n\ntruthfulness and friendliness ethical concerns    such as those\n perception\n\nof particular ethical situations as well as their choice of language-specific\n\nuh negotiation contexts<,,>\n nature of the negotiation\n\nis such that uhm negotiations are born out of a type of conflict\n So I would like to employ you for as least money as possible and\n\nyou like to work for me for as much as possible\n So there\'s a conflict and because of this conflict there needs to\n\nbe some type of discussion\n is a first important thing\n\nabout all negotiation\n It is born out of a type of clash of interests\n Now we by the department of language linguistics and philosophy\n\nbelieve that uhm a negotiation    is not simply this\n\nback and forth type of dispute resolution uhm scenario\n uhm an interpersonal negotiation\n\nof hope\n try to at the\n\ninitial stage of a negotiation position themselves   \n\nin this type of open-minded I\'m willing to concede and listen and\n\nthis type of non- <unclear> word</unclear> uhm projection     of the self at the beginning of   \n\nthe negotiation\n\n\nyou  you do not state your power at the beginning of    the negotiation\n claim feel open and\n\njust ready    to risk whatever is about to happen and\n\n   this is the standard for\n\nall negotiations\n\n\n\nand  and things like that are important\n And this raises the issue of a code of ethics uhm into negotiation\n\n\nwould like to think of the negotiation operation on two levels<,> the\n\nactual level and    the implied level\n\n\nsomething other than what is implied\n\n\nalmost always involves some type of moral decision on the part of\n\nnegotiators<,,>\n Now the emerging role of negotiation in the Jamaican context now as\n\nuhm we at the university have witnessed\n well let me try and make\n\nconsider it a bit<,,>\n What the hell\n are returning to the\n\nuniversity to further their education then    and\n\nthis is one of the issues about the dynamics of organisational staff\n So on one hand we have people returning to uhm the university or\n\nsome other tertiary institution to get tertiary level qualification on the\n\none hand\n Secondly we have people who are equipping themselves with the\n\nskills to negotiate and finally uhm    just to hold\n the rights of the\n\nworkers in the twenty-first century has really given a new shape to the\n\ndimension of an organisational staff and has really put them in a position\n\nthen for negotiation right\n organisational staff nowadays have\n\npositioned themselves we learned to at the   \n\nwinning edge    of  <- > the \n\nthe negotiation table\n this\n\ngreat need for negotiation within the organization\n of course\n\nyou know that nowadays    there\'s the\n\npossibility of instant negotiation and Lee Thompson in his two thousand one\n\nresearch discusses    the possibilities of\n\nuhm negotiation in the information age\n says that the negotiation table is\n\nno longer a physical table or a physical space\n\n\nthe information highway that\'s the scope\n\nnow of the negotiation table\n So along with the changing dynamics of the organisational staff and\n\nthe technological advancement of the twenty-first\n\ncentury there is a great need for negotiation now more than ever\n Whether global market place as we\'ll open our possibilities for\n\nnegotiation in terms of uhm    \n\nthere\'s no    this notion that there will\n\nbe trade without barriers\n So you producing your product here and uh market it to Asia or\n\nwherever this is not so far-fetched in our days\n\n\nis uhm opening up the possibilities for negotiation    intercultural negotiation as well as uhm\n\ninter-organisational negotiation between multinational organisations<,,>\n Now how does the language relate to negotiation\n\n\nthere\'s    the first stage of the\n\nnegotiation that we would like to call the orientation and position in stage\n\nand this is normally characterized by the formal language variety\n Uhm let me explain\n negotiation starts off\n\nby participants coming    to the negotiation to\n\n  uhm  settle or resolve a dispute\n that uhm participants at the negotiation\n\ndon\'t appear to be threatening    or uhm bent on\n\nallowing     the other participant\n\n  <- >     to bend\n\nto their view\n So what happens is that the participants come to the negotiation\n\nvery friendly\n which\n\nmost convenes this type of friendliness is arguably the formal\n\nvariety\n So the formalities are exchanged good morning and whatever and my\n\nposition is this and this is what I hope to achieve in the negotiation all in\n\nthe formal language variety at the initial stage\n\n\n  problem solving tool\n Now this is where the whole matter of code-switching occurs\n\n\na switch from one language variety to the other and normally this\n\nswitch is motivated by some sort of intention or function or whatever\n So in the initial stages the participants would start off with the\n\nformal language variety\n this case in the\n\nJamaican case it\'s Jamaican Standard English which as you\'re going out to see\n\nI have abbreviated as J S E\n So in the initial stage the negotiation starts off in J S E\n second\n\nstage there might be code-switching for different purposes as we go out to\n\nsee\n Now the agreement or final read out stage involves the setting up\n\n   details of what is discussed\n So what happens in this stage now is that depending on how the\n\nnegotiation turned out you might hear the formal variety or  <- > the\n\n the not so formal variety Jamaican Creole   \n\nfor different purposes<,,>\n ethical judgments are not merely relative to\n\ndifferent type of business organizations or different type of societies but\n\ndifferent type of big business practices\n So there is a different type of whether ethical code for\n\nadvertising<,> a different type of ethical code for waste disposal a\n\ndifferent type of ethical code for hiring and firing employees as well as a\n\ntype of ethical code for negotiations\n\n\na   a standard ethical code across all business\n\npractices\n\n\nhow well tricky type of interaction\n different from advertising in\n\nEnglish now     the importance is the\n\ntruth or it should be the truth telling the truth or whatever<,>\n Now I like to call this area the three Bs bluffing blackmailing and\n\nbribing\n Now these are three of the more popular negotiation tactics and\n\nuhm<,,> I would like to think that bluffing blackmailing and bribing      they are all about power\n So in the bribe what the negotiator has done is to overstate his\n\npower\n So he says you know this is what I can do while this is not\n\nnecessarily true\n\n\noverstated his power\n Blackmailing uhm as it relates to power is when one negotiator one\n\nparticipant in the negotiation reminds another participant probably a\n\nsubordinate participant uhm of his power\n So he says be careful of what you are doing because I am this\n a\n\nblackmail\n an offer to share power\n You do this and you can have this\n see\n\n    the different type of uhm relations\n\nwith how power is manipulated consolidated and uhm shared\n Now I put " lying" in inverted commas because\n\nuhm<,>   <- > there  there is no real way to\n\ndefine exactly what lying is especially when it\n\ncomes to    the negotiation\n Now is lying actually telling a false proposition\n uhm fear to\n\nconfirm what is false\n\n\n and uhm    there are so many other\n\nvariations of what could uhm involve lying right\n a lie only a lie when it\n\nis discovered\n issues\n rather than just make my own assumptions\n\n   I got a small sample I\'m still collecting data but\n\n    this is where I\'m at so far\n Now I asked informants to rank uhm situations on a scale of one\n\nunethical to five ethical<,>\n were five questions in\n\neach section\n So in the first section the three Bs bluffing blackmailing and\n\nbribing I had five questions lying five questions and  \n\n negotiation tactics Tactics such\n\nas delaying insulting complimenting and the like\n\n Right uhm section one\n\n\nto dinner to let him her understand your point of view ethical or unethical\n From section two\n Your opponent has settled before your first offer\n Even though you can offer them much better you do not mention\n\nthis<,,>\n The section three negotiation tactics\n You use compliments as a strategy and you see that it works\n\neffectively against your opponent\n\n of\n\nquestions that uhm I asked informants\n Now as it relates to language the final section section four uhm I\n\nasked informants to state which language variety they would use whether\n\nJamaican Standard English or Jamaican Creole in a particular context\n So several of the contexts include\n You wish to start the negotiation off on a friendly note\n You wish to be as clear as possible to your opponent\n You wish to appear as truthful as possible\n You wish to be humorous\n You wish to be serious\n You wish to show a disagreement and distance yourself from your\n\nopponent\n So these are some of the questions that uhm I asked informants\n\n Well uhm as Doctor Crick pointed out what we think about ethics\n\nyou know just by the myths and the stereotypes we not actually reflect what\n\nhappens in an actual research\n Now the perception of well Jamaicans is that we are the aggressive\n\ntype of persons    whenever it comes to\n\nnegotiation or arguing or whatever\n\n\nnegotiators    were very cautious and very\n\nhesitant about offending their opponents\n the question\n Your opponent is your subordinate and you remind him or her of\n\nthis before the start of    the negotiation', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM',

{'text': "<$A>  actually I'm a bit nervous I hope you don't care for\n\na couple of reasons<,>\n I'm the person\n\nthat stands between you and lunch right<,,>\n most of the things that I speak\n\nabout and<,> research for tend to have something that we can touch and feel\n\nand something that's<,> solid\n And I'm wondering how did I get myself into speaking about\n\nethics<,,>\n

guess the reason I had accepted is\n\nbecause I have been invited to<,> sit  down the  P S or J L\n\nCorporate Governance Committee<,,>\n And then a couple of days I looked at the programme and when I saw\n\nChris Bovell<,,> who is now the acting chairman of that committee was\n\nspeaking\n\n\n<unclear> word</unclear>  to someone that\n\nwas gone\n So I said well you know if I'm the greatest guy to bore them they\n\nhave a good corporate governance<,,> uhm<,> system going and there are a lot\n\nof interesting things you could say about what's happening in the company and\n\nthen on Friday I had a meeting with<,,> Douglas Orane and he said yeah for\n\ndirections   that we use today  have been borrowed from the U K<,> uh\n\nfrom the New Zealand uh code and increasingly from some of the work ethics\n\nnow being done in the U S arising out of <unclear> word</unclear> and\n\n<unclear> two-words</unclear> and so on\n\n\nregulating of governance takes place within organisations\n The key I wanna point out is that the focus on these countries has\n\nlargely been on publicly traded companies\n But in Jamaica we don't have a lot of publicly traded companies we\n\nonly have forty publicly traded companies\n the growing\n\n  the major  sectors in the economy uh are\n\nalumina<,> tourism<,,> uh<,> agriculture probably<,> shipping<,> uh\n\ninformation system\n big ones and the\n\n<unclear> word</unclear> ones\n\n uh\n\nin fact listed on the stock exchange<,> and in fact their governance<,>\n\nsystems are actually managed overseas\n In the case of agriculture there are very few\n\n\nis really there\n Now the information system and organisation are there\n we don't have uh uh the same kind of environment uh\n\n   that we find in some of these countries<,,>\n\n\ngovern  governance which are prevalent<,>\n I also want to make a point with some data that came out of uh some\n\nrecent research on the Jamaican work environment\n you can't see that so\n\nwell  there are about nine hundred and forty thousand employed in\n\nthe work force of which<,> four hundred and fifty or thereabouts are in the\n\nformal sector uh and five hundred are in the informal sector\n\n\n  what is the work environment    it's suggested that    more\n\nwork takes place in the informal sector than in the formal\n\nsector<,> that uh in fact wage earners represent\n\nuh about uh four hundred thousand and uh self- employed people four hundred\n\nand thirty<,> uh and unpaid workers about another hundred thousand\n So the structure of the Jamaican work force is vastly different\n\nfrom the kind of work forces that uh much of the work on corporate laws \n\n   were    that\n\nwere presented\n There are different kinds of governance model\n In the Jamaican context the family-owned firm or the family-\n\ncontrolled firm actually is just as   in fact more \n\nprevalent than uh many of the uh other types   \n\nof governance systems that are seen internationally\n slide I was trying to show the difference\n\nbetween uh what happens in Latin America and the Caribbean\n It's quite similar in Latin America to what happens in Jamaica and\n\nwhat happens in the United States and in the United Kingdom\n\n\n  if I look at the<,,> uh rightmost column   uh on your screen  which looks at Latin America\n\nand read clockwise\n\n\nindependence of performance and what it says is that in most cases of\n\nthe Caribbean you have insider <unclear> word</unclear> meaning that they are\n\nowned in the family\n Uh incentives are aligned with core share holders meaning that the\n\npeople who own these companies\n Uh there is very limited disclosure of these companies\nlaughter-in-\n\naudience\n Uhm there are inadequate uh minority protection\n\n\n who is outside of the family who may be associated with it\n market liquidity there is a very limited\n\nmarket for    takeovers\n and in the\n\nshareholder environment uh there is very concentrated volition\n the\n\nleftmost uh box now which looks at what happens in the more developed\n\ncountries\n now tend\n\nto be what are being promoted by the current governance principles and I fear\n\nthe widely uh established\n of\n\nincentives\n Uh there is high disclosure\n\n\n  the other protection for the minority shareholders\n Uh the capital markets these are a very active markets for\n\ntakeovers\n Uh there is an active private equity market as well in school and\n\nin  uh I P Os and the ownership is very dispersed\n So the point then is that in the developed world where much of this\n\nwork on corporate governance takes place is a very different environment from\n\nwhat prevails in Jamaica and in much of the Latin American and the Caribbean\n\n\nin  on the economic side it focuses on firms<,> and it is all\n\nin their    explicit assumption is that there\n\nare really only two ways of organizing activity either it's firms or it's\n\nmarkets\n and\n\nsomehow others have been developing other models for     how activity or work might take place\n Among the other kinds of uh uh models that you find are clans or\n\ncommunities<,,> and in our case we have uh the garrisons and so on which are\n\nclans    and which govern actually a large\n\npart of economic activity\n And there is also work on networks and associations and I've\n\nhighlighted that one because I wanna speak a little bit   \n\nabout networks\n Uh the appropriate model is in fact determined by a number of\n\nthings but most important possibly culture and what else serves that<,,>\n\ntechnology\n\n\nethics as I understand\n It's really a process of coming to know what is right or wrong at\n\nthe work place and doing what is right\n I think that is implicit in what was said by Anne as well\n The reality however is that we made of ethical dilemmas\n is\n\nnot clear and I think uh the second speaker indicated what some of those were\n The right business behaviours lie in their function of the set of\n\nfactors    which we define as culture\n\nand I think that is what uh Mister Orane had highlighted\n Business ethics in the literature would seem to suggest can best be\n\nmanaged as a programme and you know as a structured way   \n\nof doing this thing rather than    in an\n\nunstructured way\n\n\nyou have to establish rules and responsibilities for ethical decision\n\nmaking and really you should formalize these values and behaviours into a\n\ncode\n Ann spoke about that\n Uh you should align organisational behaviour within values of the\n\ncode\n Uh you should have structured mechanisms to resolve ethical\n\ndilemmas and  <- >   you should formalize ongoing\n\norders\n But orders is a lot easier said than done\n\n\nto formalize the values and behaviours of the codes\n\n\nto order these things on an ongoing basis actually proves a bit both\n\nexpensive and quite inefficient\n\n\n  these codes of ethics uh in an effective way<,,>\n But ethics is very important during times of fundamental change and\n\nit is here that I want     to depart that\n\nthe answer try to answer  Stan's question\n\n\nliberalisation the opening up of national markets<,> uh allowing all kinds of\n\nforeign direct investment and    non equity\n\narrangement among firms  <- > allowing  the Jamaican economy\n\nopening up    its markets and allowing uh\n\nothers to invest     in productive activity\n\nand other kinds of activity\n\n\nimpertive that firms step into uh world markets in order  <-> to</- >\n\n uh   to share   thus \n\nthe costs of developing these technologies because it takes so much\n\nto develop them and they are quickly made obsolete    and they've also led to a   \n\nreduction in communication and transportation costs\n have led to intensification of\n\ncompetition amongst international firms and they've tried to find new ways to\n\nimprove their efficiency by extending their search for new markets<,>\n\nshifting production from one country to the next<,> shifting some in-house\n\nactivities to overseas sites<,> and by adapting new uh commercial\n\narrangements\n In this slide I tried to show what has happened with the flows of\n\nfunds to the developing countries uh between nineteen ninety and two thousand\n\nand one and if you see that    it has increased uh it\n\nhas increased and has increased and and\n we spend a lot of time\n\nfocussing on the official flows from multinational agencies and binational\n\n   flows and so on\n uh line\n The bulk of the flows actually comes from foreign direct investment\n Why is this important\n Well if we look again at Latin America and Caribbean what happens\n\nwhen you have foreign direct investment\n on\n\nthe right shows you what has happened in terms of uh uh multinational\n\nexpansion as markets are liberalised that has kept increasing and has\n\nincreased    in the major countries\n\nin Latin America and if you look on the left most screen you see what has\n\nhappened to family-owned firms<,> they have declined\n So the structure of governance changes as foreign direct investment\n\nuh takes place", 'subdomain':

be all you\n\nwant us to be<,> for we ask it in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord<,>\n verse eight we read\n\nthe whole section from one to eight in our scripture reading\n So take your bibles and turn to Genesis chapter six and keep your\n\nfinger there\n We\'re gonna turn to other passages but keep your finger in Genesis\n\nchapter six<,> Genesis chapter six and verse eight says\n\n\n\nunearned favour an unearned blessing\n\n\nyou\'re dressed on the Sabbath and you work for the whole month   if you work by the month  at the end of the\n\nmonth they give you a salary<,,> they give you a salary<,>\n And you don\'t rush into the boss\'s room and say\n oh\n\nMrs Sampson I\'m so glad for this salary\n\n\nbeing so generous with me\n\n\n\n You worked for it\n\n of fact if

any time you see this word " grace" as it\n\nrelates to God and is treating to people<,> well you know that it is\n\nsomething we didn\'t deserve<,,> something we didn\'t deserve<,>\n\n There is nobody who could walk up to God in the throne room and say\n I am the exception\n because look at me\n And then we pull out the long sheet with our curriculum vitae and\n\nall the accomplishments we have had and all the things we did in the church\n\nand so on,\n because when we do that and God looks at all\n\nof our credentials<,> he would say even your so-called good things<,> are\n\nlike filthy rags<,>\n in Isaiah\n it was polite enough to tell you what the Hebrew for\n\n" filthy rags" really means<,,>so when you get some  time look into  it\n\n\nthat\'s what he\'s saying<,>\n\n\n unclean thing and  filthy rags<,> and the\n\nunclean thing is like the leprous person and the leprous cloth and the filthy\n\nrag is something else<,>\n\n\npre to  present ourselves before God saying God we deserve\n\nsome grace<,> God would say what you\'ve got here<,> and the sheet of paper\n\nthat you\'re showing me as your credentials is filthy rags<,,> dirty dirty\n\ncloth<,,>\n\n\n But I tell you my dear friends I like the word but when it comes to\n\nthings like this<,>\n And I\'m gonna turn now to Ephesians chapter two\n While you keep your finger in Genesis turn to the book of Ephesians\n The\n\nMessage because of the unique flavour they bring to    this<,>\n\n\n\n First and second Corinthians Galatians oh yes and then after\n\nGalatians Ephesians\n\n\n\n\n but God who is rich in mercy and so on\n from\n\nthe</ } > N I V and then I\'m gonna read it from that beautiful paraphrase\n\ncalled  The Message by Peterson\n\n\n Well let\'s start at verse four\n we were by nature\n\nobjects of wrath<,,>\n here\'s the "\n\nbut" now   but because of his great love for us\n\nGod who is rich in mercy made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in\n\ntransgressions<,>\n And God raised us up with\n\nChrist and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus<,> in\n\norder that in the coming of  ages he might show the\n\nincomparable riches of his grace expressed in his kindness to us in Christ\n\nJesus<,>\n\n\nthat not of  yourselves\n\n\n\nfor the time being\n So the Bible says we\'re all completely undeserving of anything from\n\nGod but God to his grace did something for us<,>\n You see the Bible tells us that in Noah\'s day things were\n\nterrible<,>\n In our scripture reading you get a little glimpse and the Bible\n\nwriter couldn\'t tell us all there is to be told about Noah\'s day but suffice\n\nit to know that it was terrible<,>\n Just glance down the chapter again Genesis chapter six and look at\n\nsome key words here<,>\n that the wickedness of man was great in the\n\nearth<,> that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil\n\ncontinually<,>\n\n Noah\'s day and our day seem to be very much alike\n that as it was in the days of\n\nNoah so it will be in the days when he\'s gonna come again<,>\n So we could expect them to be very similar\n So if you want to know what Noah\'s day was like then drag together\n\nthe conditions in San Francisco and the Harlem section of New York and the\n\nbad places in Jamaica and St Kitt\'s and Trinidad and put them all together in\n\none place and you get a little idea<,> of what it was like   \n\nin Noah\'s days<,>\n\n and righteousness was dragged in the earth\n\n People only practiced wickedness and the more wicked you were the\n\nmore renowned you were<,,>\n it you\n\nlook at today and you would notice that the people who get the loudest\n\nplaudits are the ones who\'re doing the most wickedness<,>\n can\'t understand why we don\'t learn\n\nfrom the past<,> but I\'m pointing out the wickedness of that time\n the marriage\n\npart the family part verse two<,>\n\n\nand that sort of thing and  the sons of   \n\nGod marrying  the daughters of men and    that kind of thing\n uh\n\nrock-bottom<,>\n Yeah and that sound like Hollywood where everybody marrying\n\neverybody else<,> and divorcing everybody else and then marrying everybody\n\nelse again you know<,>\n\n\nthe Bible says in verse six\n\n Oh my brothers and sisters I want to tell you this morning that\n\nthere is nothing that can stop God\'s grace from working<,>\n God\'s grace is prevenient\n\n So even before we did anything wrong God made provision for his\n\ngrace<,>\n don\'t quite understand\n\nGod you know<,> don\'t quite understand God but I like him<,,>\n my Bible tells me that as soon as God saw\n\nwhat was gonna happen on planet Earth he made plans for my salvation long\n\nbefore I was born<,,>\n Remember the Bible talks about Jesus being the lamb slain from the\n\nfoundation of the world\n Oh I tell you if God\'s grace is prevenient then God\'s grace is\n\npersistent<,>\n\n\n\n\n not measuring up and we ready to throw him out or

the game,\n\nand if you do not agree to play the game you will have to swallow the bitter\n\npill for that is the way things are in the world\n Those who are spoken against, whose names become a curse and a\n\nbyword are those who possess insight and who are not taken in by the trickery\n\ndeception and seduction of what is going on around the place\n\n\nshut up\n Sometimes you will have to go along to get along\n And if you do not, you will find yourself in a boat going up\n\nstream without a paddle\n These people with independent insight, with a moral clear\n\nsightedness are the ones who

speak\n\nagainst the status quo\n One may have to pay a heavy price but the accusation against those\n\nwho speak against things as they are is not false\n They are guilty of speaking the truth to power and against power\n Luke tells us to rejoice because it is on account of Jesus that we\n\nsuffer\n We are being persecuted on account of the Son of Man when we speak\n\nthe truth and speak up for right, when we stand up for the victims and\n\nstand by our principle\n If you merely speak because you do not like things as they are,\n\nyou may succeed it only in raising your blood-pressure or decreasing the\n\nlevels of your creature comforts\n When you act because of Jesus then you are rooted in the redemptive\n\nactions of God in Christ and you will not suffer alone or in vain\n We rejoice because our reward in heaven will be great\n Put another way, there is an eternal viability to our cause\n This is to say when we speak up and stand up for others and stand\n\nby our principles we are not mere men-pleasers in it for the immediate\n\nhorizon or reward\n We take the long view, we are in it for the long haul\n We are mindful of generations yet unborn\n We are speaking what is moral and what is good and what is\n\nsustainable\n If we are opposed misunderstood misrepresented villified and\n\ngenerally rejected and victimized so be it\n History will judge us kindly and God will vindicate us\n And when God and history has judged us faithful it doesn't matter\n\nwhat the time servers has said of us, our reward is incalculable\n Thirdly Luke says we are to rejoice not merely because it is for\n\nChrist's sake that we suffer and our reward in heaven is great but that we\n\nare being treated in a manner that they'd treated the prophets the heroes and\n\nthe heroines of our faith before us\n We are in good company when we are excluded and hated and insulted\n\nand rejected as evil\n That is what they did to Jesus\n That is what they did to John

rug in winter along with barely\n\ncorn found in the down of a white she- ass\n She had no money left, no health card or benefits\n She had no family support, no church support being shut out from\n\nfellowship because of her condition\n She could have no children, no future\n She had no hope as her condition was believed to be as a result of\n\nsin in her life\n Not even God could help her\n This blue lady could easily sing the part of the song which says\n\n I am so lonely, ain't got nobody to tell my troubles to\n Many of you can identify with this woman today for different\n\nreasons, you feel hopeless, you are blue\n The good thing about this woman is that she did not give up hope\n She still had the courage to seek healing\n She heard of Jesus and decided to try him\n she saw\n\nthe crowds around him, she determined to even touch just the hem of his\n\ngarment\n She did and she was changed forever, she was healed and made\n\nwhole, restored to her place and purpose in society instantly\n We can grasp the following from this episode in the life of Jesus\n\nthis morning friends is that Jesus is the real source of hope and\n\ntwo<,>Jesus responds to real seekers of hope\n Let us think of Jesus as the real source of hope\n Who is believing that something you expect to happen will happen\n It is an expectation of something desired\n This woman tried everything possible during her period of illness\n She experienced healing and deliverance from her condition\n She expected healing and deliverance from her condition but to no\n\navail\n Her encounter with Jesus brought about the desires of her heart\n Jesus was on his way in responding to the plea of Jairus a ruler of\n\nthe synagogue to come and heal his dying daughter\n As Jesus journeyed the crowd pressed around him\n Jesus could have been so preoccupied with the mission of reaching\n\nthe little girl before she died but in the midst of the crowd he felt the\n\ntouch of this insignificant and sinful woman, a castaway in society\n What does this tell us about Jesus Christ\n As the real source of hope he is always accessible and available\n He will not disappoint the heart that reaches out to him with all\n\nsincerity\n There are no barriers of class culture crowd status or race in\n\nChrist Jesus's responding to the helpless and the hopeless\n There was no waiting, no appointment, no medication or\n\ntherapy, no tests, just one touch\n There is hope in King Jesus\n This hope is real and it is available anywhere, everywhere and\n\nat any time to anyone who will reach out and touch Jesus Christ\n When you are at the end of the road to hope try Jesus\n He will not disappoint\n The following text from Hebrews four fourteen through sixteen\n\npoints out why Jesus is a real source of hope\n\n Therefore since we have a great high priest who has gone through\n\nthe heavens<,> Jesus the son of God<,> let us hold firmly to the faith we\n\nprofess\n For we do not have an high priest who is unable to sympathise with\n\nour weaknesses but we have one who has been tempted in every way just as we\n\nare\n Yet was without sin\n Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence so that we\n\nmay receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need\n The word of God\n We're called brothers and sisters to seek Jesus Christ earnestly\n He is the God who feels every pain, who knows our every\n\ncircumstances and who cures our deepest problem, sin\n Not only do we speak of Jesus as the real source of hope but we\n\nalso recognize that Jesus responds to real seekers\n This woman came to Jesus as a helpless broken tired person\n There was something in the woman that touched Jesus\n It was real faith\n She was a genuine seeker\n She came to Jesus without any condition throwing herself at his\n\nmercy and grace\n Her faith was real in that she completely surrendered herself and\n\ncondition to the mercy of Jesus\n She was not afraid of the abusive crowd\n Hers was faith that looked beyond the obstacles to the omnipotence\n\nof Jesus Christ\n It was a trust and belief that led her to act to touch Jesus at all\n\ncosts\n Her faith action brought God's presence into her environment and\n\nchanged it\n There are many who believe in God, but want God to come into\n\ntheir situation and circumstances on their terms\n There is still pride and rebellion\n Real seekers of God in Jesus Christ must be willing to surrender\n\nall\n They must be willing to break through their personal crowds of\n\npride stubbornness and self- centredness\n This woman's focus was completely on Jesus as the source of her\n\ndeliverance\n Her healing was always there in the presence of Jesus\n All she had to do was to activate it by touching Jesus, just one\n\ntouch\n The real seeker of hope in God must be willing to stand up,\n\nstand out and confess Jesus Christ as Lord\n Jesus called for the woman's confession of her situation\n, he asked\n Jesus's response to you and your situation is not impersonal\n Jesus not only identified the woman who touched him but he also\n\ncalled her  daughter\n This reflected his love and acceptance of her\n The castaway had now come into an intimate relationship with the\n\nLord Jesus Christ\n It reflected her wholeness as a human being and her restoration to\n\nsociety\n Jesus wants you to know that he identifies with your searching for\n\nhim\n He wants you to identify with his longing for your touch\n The real seeker of Jesus must be willing to testify of Jesus's\n\ntouch in his or her life\n The cry, the search of the sincere heart which abandons itself\n\nto the almighty power and the presence of God in Jesus Christ will not be\n\nrejected by God\n My friends we remind you today that Jesus is the real source of\n\nhope and he responds to real seekers\n He awaits your touch\n I believe if this woman were here today her testimony would be\n\nsomething like this\n I was sick and suffering\n I lost everything\n I felt so cursed because of my sickness\n I felt shame and self-pity\n My family ignored me\n The church fellowship turned its back on me\n I just felt so unworthy\n I felt tired and unhappy\n I just got sick and tired of being sick\n Doctors exploited me\n I did every test possible\n I spent every cent I had\n I borrowed all I could\n Then I heard about this man Jesus\n I heard he did so many things for so many people\nI thought\n I don't have anything to lose\n I've lost so much already\n My pride, my dignity as a woman, as a human being\n I decided to come out of the shadows\n No one would really notice me in the crowd anyway\n I must touch him\n From all I have heard about him I believe that just a touch of his\n\nclothing would heal me\n So I pushed through the hostile crowd, they stepped on me, I\n\nwas so near to him sometimes\n Just a teeny push away and I was pushed away in the sea of people\n They stepped on my hands as I crawled on my knees scraping on the\n\nground\n They hurled unkind words at me\n Woman, where you come from\n\n Then I just barely had the chance and touched his garment\n Immediately I felt something move in me\n I felt healed, joy was in my heart\n I couldn't believe it\n For a moment the world stopped when Jesus asked\n Who touched me\n I felt afraid but he called me out\n I had to speak\n he touched me\n Ohhh he touched me and all the joy that floods my soul,\n\nsomething happened and now I know it is Jesus that touched me and made me\n\nwhole\n Why don't you touched him too\n He touched me, I touched him and he changed me forever\n\n This can/could be your testimony today\n You may not have been sick like this woman but there are other\n\nsituations in your life which oppresses you\n What is your situation\n Perhaps you are suffering from the greatest terror which affects\n\nhumanity, sin\n No one else but Jesus Christ can deliver you from the power of sin\n Why not trust him now\n Reach out and touch him now\n He will respond to your touch\n He is the real source of your hope\n I invite you to pray even now asking Jesus to come into your life\n\nand into your situation\n I invite you today to visit a church of your choice and make known\n\nyour decision to commit to Jesus Christ as Lord\n I invite you to return to God in Jesus Christ\n If you are a backslider you need his touch\n He is waiting on you\n Whatever your condition right now reach out and touch Jesus with\n\nit\n He is there waiting for you\n\n\n\n\n<$A> Hate you when they exclude you\n\nand insult you and reject

minute lecture but is uhm not quite as long as  Passa\n\nPassa\n let me share with\n\nyou the structure\n and then I make some\n\ngeneral    remarks about culture before\n\ngoing on to discuss in some detail what I consider to be the driving force of\n\nJamaican culture and some of its most important manifestations\n I situate this culture in the global context looking\n\nat how    it has been impacted\n Fourth and finally I draw a few conclusions\n\n Globalization in the eyes of many people is nothing new\n Capitalism had from as early as the sixteenth century been\n\nglobalizing the world\n The peoples of Africa suborned into slavery in the Caribbean\n\nfollowed in the nineteenth century by Indians lured into indentureship were\n\namong the first to taste the effects of an early form of what Nettleford\n\ncalls  new hegemonic obscenities passing under the mantra of\n\nsomething called globalization\n as Clive Thomas put it the Caribbean was the nursery in which\n\nmany of the original elements of global capitalism and the world market were\n\nnurtured<,>\n It could therefore be said that the Caribbean was globalization's\n\nbaby\n\n\n\nnought/not<,>\n if the Caribbean has seen\n\nit all before having been created by it Thomas is nevertheless insistent that\n\nthe current globalization is qualitatively different enough from earlier eras\n\nto warrant seeing in it quote  an unmistakable paradigm shift both in\n\nthe way in which the world is conceived and how it is acted upon<,>\n\nend of quote<,,>\n Despite the fact that many things remain the same international\n\ntrade being no greater in two thousand than it was in nineteen thirteen and\n\nthe rate of foreign investment the same as a hundred years ago\n Despite these the current global transformation in science and\n\ntechnology the changes in the international landscape<,> the collapse of the\n\nbipolar world the emergence of a single hegemonic power and the resultant\n\ndisappearance of third spaces previously exploited by developing countries<,>\n\nthe proliferation and transnationalisation of social problems such as narco-\n\ntrafficking and terrorism and the commercialisation of knowledge to cite a\n\nfew examples are unprecedented in scale and in scope\n The world is so much more interconnected than before that even\n\nnational projects require being thought of in global contexts\n Critical to that interconnectedness is the technologically driven\n\nrevolution in communications<,>\n\n\nallowed immediate coverage of Nelson Mandela's step from prison to freedom to\n\nhundreds of millions of people all over the world<,>\n Participating in such events as the Olympics or the World Cup or\n\nany other event of significance is quite commonplace\n And because one not only hears but also sees it has to be deemed\n\nqualitatively different from the blow by blow radio commentary on the world\n\nheavyweight fight by Joe Louis in the nineteen fifties or the ball by ball\n\ncommentary of a John Arlott on a West Indies versus England test match in the\n\nnineteen seventies\n Satellite television takes viewers into an event taking place\n\nhalfway around the world in a way that the earlier audio transmission did not\n\nand it gives them advantages that even those physically present do not have\n\nat least not yet such as the benefits of replay slow motion and close-up\n\nimaging<,>\n Interconnectedness is at the heart of the meaning of globalization\n\nand it is not in itself a bad thing<,>\n If the unification of the present world is proceeding at an\n\nunprecedented rate it is capital that drives it but a capital motivated by\n\nthe conviction that its own freedom of movement unimpeded by national\n\nbarriers represents the best hope for all the peoples of the world<,>\n Free trade is now the new orthodoxy both for the prosperity of the\n\nalready industrialized countries and the development of the former colonies\n\nwhich by    deregulating state involvement in\n\nthe economy and lowering their trade barriers in order to allow the free\n\nentry and movement of capital are able so it is argued to develop rapidly to\n\ntake competitive advantage of the global market and thus to satisfy the needs\n\nand yearnings of their peoples<,>\n But the results have been far from living up to such hopes\n Under neoliberalism the nations of the world have grown further\n\napart polarized by income and consumption into the very rich countries of the\n\nNorth Atlantic and the very poor countries of the southern hemisphere where\n\nlives the majority of humankind\n As national trade barriers fall and transnational corporations move\n\nin the transfer of wealth for what Nettleford calls  the two-thirds\n\nworld to the first world has intensified the inequality between\n\nnations to such a degree that the combined personal wealth of the two richest\n\nmen in that world is greater than the combined national wealth of the poorest\n\nforty countries\n Globalization as an inexorable process of interconnectedness must\n\ntherefore be set apart quite distinctly from the process of liberalization\n\nthat currently drives and uses it to enrich and empower the already rich and\n\npowerful at the expense of the poor and the powerless\n Indeed C Y Thomas argues the south needs globalization in order to\n\nrespond effectively to the harmful aspects of liberalization through what he\n\ncalls  a global focus on issues of concern such as capital\n\ndeficiency<,> market access and poverty alleviation through south-south\n\ncooperation and regional and sub-regional groupings\n\n Now culture according to the late Clifford Geertz is the meanings\n\nthose  webs of significance we attach to all forms of human\n\nbehaviour\n An economic transaction is cultural only to the extent that the\n\nbehaviours that constitute it have meaning<,>\n Often such meaning is latent in that it manifests itself only when\n\nthe expected behaviour is breached\n For example there is nothing particularly cultural about paying for\n\nthe tomatoes one buys and as a strictly economic activity it should not\n\nmatter how the money is paid<,>\n But no activity is strictly economic\n It is enacted in forms that are often taken for granted until they\n\nare breached or violated\n Thus payment made by throwing instead of handing the money could be\n\ntaken as signalling disrespect for the person or occupation of the \n\nhiggler and thus would the latent meaning of personal respect in\n\neconomic transaction of buying and selling come to the fore\n The culture of everyday life is like that\n Pattern behaviours ranging from the morning ablutions and good\n\nmorning rituals to food preparation and consumption child rearing<,> gender\n\nrelations and socialization into which are encoded meanings by which a people\n\nlive together as social beings<,>\n There are four principal characteristics of any culture\n culture is\n\npublic because meaning is\n\n But second because it is shared culture is a source of identity\n The language and language arts religious beliefs and practices\n\nrituals  food ways kinship and gender relations artistic production\n\nand performance all these serve to give a people a sense of themselves but\n\nalways in contradistinction to other peoples with a different system of\n\nmeanings<,>\n culture is transmissible across generations through the\n\nsocialization of the young and across ethnic and political boundaries through\n\nmigration and other forms of close contact and interaction\n culture is subject to change whether from internal\n\nevolution environmental shifts conquest immigration or from exposure to other\n\ncultures\n The emergence of a Jamaican culture is the result of the forced\n\nmigration of African peoples over several centuries the forging by them of a\n\nnew identity and their absorption and integration of certain cultural\n\nfeatures of other groups particularly the Indians who joined their society as\n\nindentured labourers in the nineteenth century and the English who first\n\nenslaved and colonized them from as early as the seventeenth century and\n\nwhose cultural retentions political control racial and social standing served\n\nas the hegemonic centre of gravity for the society right up to political\n\nindependence in nineteen sixty-two<,>\n Independence from Britain marked the beginning of an important era\n\ncharacterized by the shaping of a national cultural identity based mainly on\n\nthe lower classes whose rural concentration and origin shaped the foundations\n Urbanization on the scale now taking place in Jamaica was until\n\nrecently another word for the growth of Kingston as throughout the twentieth\n\ncentury the drift from country to town was incremental in that the capital\n\nwas the final of a series of stops that included other estates and rural\n\ntownships\n This certainly was the case in the period prior to the Second World\n\nWar and with the onset of large-scale migration to Britain after the war\n\nKingston the main    port of departure became a\n\ndirect attraction\n to free entry into\n\nthe United Kingdom in nineteen sixty-two and rising in unemployment\n\nparticularly among the youth was characterized by overcrowded concentration\n\nmainly on the western fringes of the city under very poor living\n\nconditions<,>\n As I will mention presently some of the developments most critical\n\nto the evolution of Jamaica's sense of identity    in particular issues of race and the\n\nshaping of a new genre of music were the innovations of a rural people turned\n\nurban but carrying with them the outlook values and practices of their\n\norigin<,>\n This was true of the Rastafari\n It was also true of those who created Reggae music and of the icons\n\nsuch as Bob Marley and Peter Tosh who internationalized it\n Marley migrated to Kingston from the rural district of Nine Miles\n\nin the parish of Saint Ann while Tosh came from the seaside village of\n\nBelmont in the parish of Westmoreland<,>\n\n\nquite the opposite\n Indeed it is certain that without the sound technology of the sound\n\nsystem at the recording studios Reggae would have been impossible\n However the influence of rural Jamaica its values many of its\n\nbeliefs its aesthetics and morality on the city has been profound\n Kingston and its suburban parish of St Andrew grew by seventy-six\n\nper cent between nineteen forty-three and nineteen sixty and by forty per\n\ncent over the next two decades\n Its sprawling spread into St Andrew and St Catherine while\n\nretaining its pull as a commercial and political centre makes planners speak\n\nof the Kingston metropolitan area a concentration of one third of the\n\npopulation of two point six million a large city by our small island\n\nstandards though a small one by world standards\n rapid surface\n\ntransportation density of people in motion shopping areas factories and so\n\nforth Kingston was little more than a congeries of communities each retaining\n\nits own sense of community and identity very much like the rural districts\n\nwhich despite their dispersed layout congealed around church school and\n\nvillage square in practices of voluntarism reciprocation and interdependency\n It is this sense of community that formed the basis of the armed\n\ngarrisons that splash themselves across the political landscape from the late\n\nnineteen sixties up to the present time", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '00780837-2082-40ed-bb06-b53e438e3a01', 'added':

going to play<,>\n Uhm I'm going to play with words this afternoon and although I'm\n\nquite sure that these words are not going to inform any change of any kind of\n\npolicy uh I hope that you will enjoy some thoughts that I would like to share\n\nwith you something that I am particularly passionate about and that is the\n\nJamaican heritage particularly the heritage in music<,> the power of the beat\n\nthe vibratory nature of things<,>\n\n not at all\n\ncontradictory in my estimation as both the word and the Big Bang are\n\nexpressions of awesome power resounding power setting everything oscillating\n\nin vibratory motion<,>\n The vibration of particles and objects that produce sound in our\n\nbodies in our world and throughout nature demonstrate the existence of an\n\nenergy that extends not only to the far corners of our galaxy but to the\n\nwhole universe<,>\n Astronomers tell us that a massive black hole releases sound waves\n\nin a deep base pitch\n In October two thousand and three the news website of the Canadian\n\nBroadcasting Corporation posted information on NASA's orbiting Chandra X-ray\n\nobservatory    and that it was able to listen\n\nto sound waves coming from deep within the Perseus cluster<,>\n This giant group of galaxies two hundred and fifty million light\n\nyears from earth was being studied with great excitement and focus\n This is a difficult fact for our minds to grasp as a light year is\n\na distance that light travels in a year in a vacuum<,>\n\n\n  fact that astrophysicist at NASA also found the\n\npitch of the sound to be about fifty-seven octaves below Middle C the note\n\nwhich is roughly in the middle of the standard piano keyboard and the\n\nfrequency to be more than a million times deeper than the limits of human\n\nperception\n Before black holes were thought to give off energy as light and\n\nheat\n\n\n Professor of chemistry Jim Gimzewski in a research laboratory at\n\nthe University of California in Los Angeles discovered that a minute cell of\n\nyeast observed through an atomic force microscope and subjected to computer\n\nimaging has the motion of its membranes recorded providing discernible high\n\npitch sound which can be listened to<,>\n The whole universe is alive with sound humming melody and harmony\n\nalive with rhythm with sound waves being sent and received sounds of stars\n\nand mud pools crickets and toads the songs of birds and dolphins the buzzing\n\nof bees and the roar of the lion\n To this we may add water crashing against rocks the howling wind\n\nrain showers and thunder\n These sounds are omnipresent often above and below the threshold of\n\nconscious hearing\n So fundamental is the sound material that it must influence\n\neverything we experience through feeling and thinking\n Music however is a special kind of sound\n Whereas a bottle crashing to the floor produces unordered\n\nunstructured sound waves whose frequencies and volumes bear no relationship\n\nto each other that is noise the patterns of vibration that produce music are\n\norganized into systems elements of melody harmony rhythm durational\n\nrelationships and clear proportions<,>\n a human language accompanying the stages of\n\nlife and rites of passage<,> affecting emotions<,> levels of consciousness\n\nspiritual response and upliftment<,>\n During the nineteenth century scientific research into the\n\nphysiological effects of music measured the results of its action on heart\n\nrate the circulatory system blood pressure and respiration\n The findings were that body rhythms are affected by music\n They can be decelerated and accelerated\n Sound waves on entering the body stirred sympathetic vibrations in\n\ncells at an elemental molecular level and the conducting of sound through the\n\ncells is facilitated by the high water content of the body\n And you only have to be working as hard as I was today to know\n\nabout that water content<,>\n\n\n\nsweat\n Experiments have shown that the heart rate and breath can be slowed\n\nby listening to music with a steady regular pulse of about sixty beats a\n\nminute<,>\n by Johann\n\nPachelbel a late seventeenth-century composer works well in this instance\n This process called entrainment demonstrates the tendency for two\n\noscillating bodies to lock into phase so that they vibrate in the same\n\npattern\n is very often used to\n\naccompany the entry into the church of bridesmaids at\n\nweddings<,,>\n Perhaps more relevant to our culture is syncopation and irregular\n\nsubdivision of the beat occurring when a note is played just ahead of or\n\ndelayed beyond the listener's expectation\n It is most often experienced as physically stimulating and exciting\n Our physical responses are even more complex when one considers the\n\nlayers of rhythm that are played in combination in music for dance\n To our ancestors the music of this earthly plane of existence was\n\npart of a sacred pattern and moved in a parallel fashion or in counterpoint\n\nwith the music of the spheres<,> cosmic music and obeyed divine laws<,>\n Since music it is said can bypass the logical and analytical\n\nfilters of the mind it can then make direct contact with the emotions\n\nprofound feelings passions which lie deep in the memory and the imagination\n Naturally physical reactions follow and these effects are resonant\n\non both the individual and the culture specific levels<,>\n Yet we must be aware that contrary to the thinking of many persons\n\non one side of the often heated debate on the value of Jamaican music music\n\nitself is morally neutral\n In other words this potent force can be used to good effect or as a\n\nnegative power producing disorientation and irritation\n Science is catching up with traditional wisdom and there is now a\n\nbody of knowledge supported by experiment analysis and thesis on the\n\naffective power of music on the body and the mind<,>\n In the nineteen nineties at the universities of\n\nM<*>u-umlaut</*>nster and Dortmund in Germany<,> Doppler sonography brain\n\nscans found that when subjects listened to music the blood flow to the right\n\nhemisphere of the brain increased\n Music with very strong rhythms however increased the blood flow in\n\nboth hemispheres pitch and rhythm being processed in different parts of the\n\nbrain<,>\n This is significant for understanding how a good number of\n\nJamaicans respond to music<,>\n To sit still while listening to music is well-nigh impossible for\n\nthe average Jamaican and that my audience sat still just now shows that you\n\ncertainly are not average<,>\n I should like to suggest that such behaviour is learned\n\n Thus rhythm that is the beat is of primary importance in our\n\nmusical landscape\n A natural response to rhythm is movement be it snapping of the\n\nfingers reinforcement of the pulse by tapping of the feet or movement of the\n\nhead and shoulders\n\n\nLa Campanella\n The German investigators mentioned before observed that melody\n\nappears to act on the limbic system that is the emotional core which moves\n\none to feelings of discomfort and despair uh fear joy sadness excitement or\n\npeace\n Physiological changes as volunteers listened to music confirmed\n\nbeliefs that had been held for centuries that music in major keys with fairly\n\nfast tempos correlated with a lightness a sense of joy and happiness while\n\nslow tempos and music with minor key tonality reflected a kind of    sadness\n And I saw just now heads moving along with the Liszt piece\n\n in\n\nan edition of  Natural Health cites research done by the\n\nRochester School of Medicine showing that the deaf are able to sense\n\nvibration in the part of the brain usually used for hearing\n I should like to reiterate the fact that it is not only the organs\n\nof hearing that are responsive to sound\n The cells of the body are also sound

energizes the marking of milestones on the\n\njourney of life from the womb to the tomb has shown an unmistakeably\n\naffective power<,>\n It is a force that inspires initiates and supports movement on the\n\nphysical emotional and psychical planes of existence\n From the earliest days of our heritage the pre-Columbian period of\n\nthe Tainos which in my day we knew as Arawaks<,> music played a functional\n\nrole in the celebration of the stages of life<,> birth<,> marriage<,>\n\ndeath<,> and in the recreational ball games called \n\nare<*>i-acute</*>tos<,>\n Taino music used bone and reed flutes large drums with manatee skin\n\nheads and rattles worn on wrists and ankles\n With the demise of this indigenous group musical expression\n\ndeveloped through the collision of British and African cultural norms\n\nprimarily<,> with the insertion of oriental and Middle Eastern observations\n European musical inputs include our scale patterns and the triadic\n\nharmonies of hymnody<,> folk material in the songs and dances of artisans\n\ntradesmen and sailors military and ceremonial music and the instrumental\n\nresources of the tabor stringed and wind instruments<,>\n The power of the beat has been critical to the reception and\n\nappreciation of music in the island\n There is very strong evidence of the survival of African features\n\nmost importantly the emphasis on rhythm and the preponderance of drums and\n\nother percussion instruments in our music\n These survivals are strongest where there is an overall supporting\n\nAfrican tradition\n Playing the most important role in keeping these musical elements\n\nalive is religious ritual of which rhythm the beat is an integral part\n We'll now hear rhythm of Africa particularly from Ghana with a\n\nshort excerpt of an incantation a chant and a  dono a\n\ntalking drum<,,>\n The drum has pride of place among most if not all instrumental\n\nensembles in traditional folk music and the popular musics of the present and\n\nthe not too distant past\n The drum salutes gods and ancestral spirits\n It accompanies dance\n It controls possession\n It attends celebrations and ceremonials for the dead provides

my colleague fellows distinguished\n\nyes ladies and gentlemen<,>\n Nothing save the omnipresence of Jehova is more all embracing than\n\nthe definition of culture<,> the totality of beliefs behaviour and values\n\nwhich shapes and is shaped by humanity\n Based on this all encompassing perspective we should expect the\n\ninfluence of culture to be dominant\n But so take now we by the forces which impact on our economic lives\n\naffect our social order and determine the cultural psyche that we have mostly\n\nfailed to recognise the powerful underlying dynamics of culture\n An appropriate starting point in the recognition of cultural\n\nidentity is to trace the traits that have emerged or survived over\n\ngenerations which actually recommend themselves by their dominant cultural\n\npresence in traditional society\n So we begin\n In young nations such as Jamaica history is a mix of cultures which\n\nhave been stratified in layers of society<,> shaped by the experiences of\n\nfolk life and modern society<,> moulded by metropolitan influences\n Jamaica is a well-defined model of a dual society\n Two Jamaicas blending at points of contact\n Traditional identities are created from the perceptions and\n\nrealities which characterise Jamaican folk life\n\n\ntracing dominant influences from birth to mature periods of life outlining\n\nthe experiences which shape and the characteristics which define the cultural\n\nidentity as influenced by Jamaican folk culture\n\n Folk wisdom creates its own traditional technology characterised as\n\na mix of pseudo-scientific and ethno-religious lore\n Food and drink are widely applied categories of traditional beliefs\n\nand practices throughout the many stages of life\n Traditional cultural practices for instance do not promote the use\n\nof fresh milk from the cow for essential protein content to assist the brain\n\ndevelopment in feeding infants\n To compensate there are substitutes in the form of milk powder and\n\nsoya in package form\n However the use of bush teas lacking protein value is still\n\npractice although declining\n Health clinics are addressing this problem for expectant and\n\nnursing mothers by some distribution of milk powder\n To the extent that milk powder is available through small sachets\n\nor packages distributed commercially and to some degree in public clinics the\n\nnutritional requirements for brain development in the formative stages of\n\ninfancy are now more adequately covered\n The alternative to milk is soya which is becoming more widely\n\navailable provides essential proteins and is reasonably affordable to mothers\n\nin low-income households\n Cornmeal porridge is still the traditional complementary food for\n\nyoung infants though declining\n The optimal option exclusive breastfeeding falls victim to\n\ntraditional theories of child nutrition\n Breast-fed infants are less likely to suffer from gastroenteritis\n\nand more likely to acquire a healthy body weight\n supplement breastfeeding with\n\nwater formula or porridge quite early\n of mothers still exclusively breastfeed\n\nat six weeks in 2003\n\n\nbreastfeed often begins in the second week<,> and is linked to lower\n\nrates of weight and height gain\n Recent studies associate poor growth in infancy with lower levels\n\nof cognitive functioning particularly in language development\n Moreover commercial baby food has ceased to be a viable option to\n\nlow-income purchasers in the traditional society\n Public clinics can only afford to provide the most malnourished\n\nwith nutritional supplementation including formula\n It is no wonder that a familiar failing in the nutritional\n\npractices of early childhood is the use of half-measure portions of\n\ncommercial brands of feeding to save money\n This becomes one part solution one part problem at a time when full\n\nprovision for nutritional needs is required\n Certainly the possibility for a fully productive education is\n\nimpaired when the brain is unable to reach its full potential\n beginning\n\nseventy-five per cent of graduates from secondary schools become\n\neducationally lost<,> failing the school-leaving examination graduating\n\nwithout any base to build a career and unprepared for participating in a\n\nfulfilling life\n The consequential impact in terms of inadequate brain development\n\nbegins from this primary stage setting the base for educational\n\nunderachievement and behavioural problems in childhood years and beyond\n A trait of cultural identity begins to take form\n The newly born infant begins life in traditional folk society with\n\na pattern of indulgence in feeding whether breast or bottle\n Suckling is on demand\n Feeding schedules are not practised by nursing mothers\n An expectation of satisfaction on impulse as a personality\n\ncharacteristic is fostered by this feeding regime\n Weaning particularly in poor rural areas extends well beyond the\n\ncustomary term\n Urban mothers observe the more rigid scientifically prescribed\n\nmethods or standards for child rearing\n In some cases it is possible for infants to be suckled for up to\n\none and a half to two years in the rural areas to supplement other feeding<,>\n\nparticularly where there is less pressure on time\n On the other hand in the inner city setting where there is more\n\ndemand for time earlier weaning from the breast or bottle is more widely\n\npractised\n Toilet training too is unregimented\n Bed wetting and diaper soiling are indulged for longer periods than\n\nthe regular course in more regimented societies until naturally developing\n\nbody  functions and growing social rebuke establish appropriate\n\nhabits over a gradual period of time\n This lack of regimentation contributes to another personality trait\n\nsatisfaction on demand impulsiveness which begins to emerge in the early\n\nmould of cultural identity\n The overindulgence of affection lavished on the infant in early\n\nchildhood is in sharp contrast to the realities of the more aggressive world\n\ninto which young children are introduced in the post- weaning pre-school\n\nperiod when the infant now becomes recognise as a more responsible being able\n\nto know better and to understand more\n Aggressive reactions to misconduct involve corporal punishment as a\n\npart of the harsh training regime at this stage\n learn better now\n This implies that the young child is now of age to do better\n An ambivalence emerges at this stage\n The earlier relationship of lavish affection and overindulgence in\n\nthe training of primary functions which characterise infancy is now subject\n\nto sharp rebukes rejection and even harsh treatment\n The family is no longer only a source of love but suddenly an agent\n\nof discipline and at times fear\n the situation analysis of\n\nJamaican children highlights the widespread nature of Jamaican corporal\n\npunishment both physically and psychologically\n Seventy-two percent of Jamaican parents use methods to discipline\n\ntheir children which are characterised by some form of violence\n The confidence of self and the security with which children should\n\nbe building at this stage is weakened\n insecurity in the\n\nmaturing adult leading to submissiveness and lower levels of achievement or\n\nalternatively hyper-aggressive ignorant responses\n As the child advances beyond the stage of constant parental care\n\nand observation it is introduced to a competitive environment in a wide range\n\nof relationships\n Whether rural or urban household space is limited\n One large bed generally accommodates several family members in the\n\npoorest households\n Even space under the bed or on the floor is use for sleeping at\n\ntimes in some very poor households\n In less basic conditions enjoyed by most space is still tight\n There is a lack of adequate rest on overcrowded beds where\n\nprotruding elbows and knees make sound sleep difficult\n\n\nreduces energy level in the day leading to low productivity and\n\nirritable responses which prejudice family and social relations\n Insufficient household space is no different from insufficient food\n\nparticularly in poor inner city households\n The position is openly stated\n\n and inner-city homes this is usually\n\na heavy evening meal after returning from the field or work\n In urban life the early evening meal is most certain\n Inner city children face a struggle for yard space which spills out\n\nonto the streets\n Insufficient food overcrowded schools and inadequate desk space add\n\nto the competing demands of an aggressive environment producing aggressive\n\nresponses\n Rural environments which have less struggle for food and yard space\n\nshow less aggression than inner-city areas where competition for scarce\n\nbenefits generates ongoing aggressive responses\n The aggressiveness of this competitive environment is tempered only\n\nby the widespread recognition that there is a need to share\n The generosity of spirit of the poor who in Jamaica are truly their\n\nbrother's keepers is legendary\n\n\n  communities neighbours adopt the helpless\n\npoor\n Generally distressed persons are sheltered even by storing personal\n\nbelongings in cramped quarters on traumatic occasions such as the loss of a\n\nhome by fire or other means\n Determination to aggressively and competitively overcome the odds\n\nof scarcity with challenging responses particularly in inner-city settings in\n\nwhich the odds of encounters are higher portray another cultural trait in the\n\nmaking tempered only by a tradition of caring\n The continuing indulgence of children dictates a relaxed approach\n\nto school attendance\n Appreciation that every day in school counts is limited by the\n\neconomic necessities for children to abstain from school to take care of\n\nyounger ones while the older ones gather loads of produce to sell at weekly\n\nmarkets\n Mostly the realities of poverty contribute to abstentions because\n\nof the inability to find school fees and the cost of lunch school books\n\ntransport and other items\n Greater abstention yet results from a factor which has no\n\njustification economically\n Attendance records indicate a well-established pattern of approach\n\nto attendance\n At the beginning of the week attendance is low\n On a weekly basis the pattern shows maximum attendance on Tuesdays\n\nand Wednesdays with some decline on Thursday and a dramatic fall-off on\n\nFridays particularly in rural schools\n Urban schools have overcome much of the Friday fall-out as parents\n\nprefer to see children in the safety of a regulated school environment than\n\nunsupervised at home\n The same pattern prevails for the term and the year going from a\n\nlow level peaking towards a mid-period and tapering off as the end approaches\n The basis for this pattern which reduces average annual attendance\n\nto some    seventy percent or less of\n\nenrolment is a continuation of the indifferent approach to formal regimes of\n\nconduct which are rationalised strictly on the basis of situational needs and\n\nimpulse satisfaction\n The rationalisation is at the beginning of the week term or year\n\n school just open dem don't have to go yet\n school soon finish make dem stay\n\nhome and do something useful and is the last day  dem\n\ncan wait till Monday or next term or next year\n This same pattern prevails through working life for workers who are\n\nnot in an enforced work regime\n Mondays are use to mark out the work\n Tuesdays and Wednesdays for full work days\n and\n\nthere is little work at all\n Another trait of cultural identity becomes clearer\n The indifference to regimes of conduct continues beyond the earlier\n\nrelaxed pattern of indulgence in early childhood training\n Children who perform despite this crucible test of indifferent\n\nattendance go on to be achievers\n Parents recognise by eleven years of age whether the child's head\n\ncan  tek learning\n Every sacrifice is made to encourage and support those performers\n\nidentified in this category even to the greater neglect of the others\n After secondary school graduation many of these achievers\n\nparticularly females if not able to afford tertiary education immediately\n\nwill work for years to accumulate funds to enable them to satisfy their\n\nambition to complete a tertiary course\n This is testimony to the assertiveness and determined approach\n\nlearned earlier in the competitive environment<,>\n The obstacles experienced in the development of the child screens\n\nout those with capability by a process of survival of the fittest\n The consequence is a comparatively small but well qualified\n\nabsence of regimentation allows creative process to blossom small segment of\n\nthe labour force who survive

really say that a repressive society would result in\n\ncreative art but somehow it does help\n It is an ingredient\n from John\n\n Canny\n The epitaph at the beginning of this paper says something about the\n\npeople who made the musics discussed in this presentation performance\n\npractices around them and the conditions of repression and exploitation under\n\nwhich they lived\n Both are linked\n I would like to offer a moment of silence for all our grandmothers\n\ngrandfathers and great-grands who were part of those struggles to create live\n\nand name their place in the world and importantly those who died trying to\n\nrecord the cultural history of some of these performance practices\n I think Sir Philip Sherlock would have agreed to this\n right now\n Black musics and their corresponding performance practices have\n\ndeeper continuities than movement musical and celebratory patterns\n Crucially these deeper continuities have not been fully explored by\n\nsuch disciplines as ethno-musicology geography or cultural studies\n Based on data gathered over twelve years participation in Jamaica\'s\n\ndancehall performance and over six years of research I wish to expand my\n\nreading of new-world performance practices to other black performance genres\n Essentially by analysing dancehall\'s macro and micro spatialities\n\nspatial categories philosophies and systems were revealed thereby delineating\n\nwhat is best captured by the term " performance\n\ngeography"<,>\n and\n\napplication of performance geography to black performance practices from the\n\nmiddle passage slave ship to urban ghettos such as Limbo<,,>  \n\n the slave ship dance    Delta\n\nand later urban Blues Kingston\'s Dancehall and South-African Kwaito that\n\noccupies this paper\n What is performance geography\n By " performance" I mean physical mental emotional\n\nand spiritual performance for the task of enacting one\'s being in the black\n\nAtlantic space between violation ruptured roots and self-reconstruction\n It is a requirement for life\n Like the enslaved who arrived at Kingston harbour after the ordeal\n\nof the middle passage in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries inner-city\n\nyouth survive the challenges of the urban experience through their strategies\n\nof performance voluntarily or not\n Further with renewed interest in space and its implied discourse of\n\nspatiality spawned by the works of Michel Foucault Edward Soja and others I\n\nsee performance geography<,> as developing on the work of Catherine Nash and\n\nNigel Thrift on the role of performance    specifically embodied practices in cultural\n\ngeography\n It looks at the way people living in particular locations give\n\nthose locations identity through performance\n Bearing in mind that this is work in progress I see it as a mapping\n\nof the locations used types and systems of use politics of their location in\n\nrelation to other sites and other practices the character of events or\n\nrituals in particular locations and how different performances or performers\n\nrelate to each other within and across cultures\n My contextualization of performance geography in the context of\n\nblackness the new world and its middle passage history invokes Gilroy\'s Black\n\nAtlantic as a counter-culture of modernity but there are ways that I depart\n\nfrom that reading even as my work continues that tradition\n on the lack of\n\nattention to material forces from  Peter Sutherland on the virtual\n\nabsence of examples from Latin America Africa and the wider Caribbean in the\n\nformation of the transatlantic black culture and core and core on the absence\n\nof the middle passage history of suffering as a lost reference in the\n\nconstruction of black Atlantic scholarship from Gilroy I concur with him when\n\nhe states    quote in the space and\n\ntime that separate Robert Johnson\'s "  Hellhound on my Trail" the wailer\'s\n\nexhortation to keep on moving and the more recent soul to soul piece with the\n\nsame name the expressive cultures of the black Atlantic world have been\n\ndominated by a special mood of restlessness\n These songs evoke and affirm a condition in which the negative\n\nmeanings given to the enforced movement of blacks are somehow transposed\n What was initially a curse the curse of homelessness or enforced\n\nexile gets repossessed\n It becomes affirmed and is reconstructed as the basis of a\n\nprivileged standpoint from which certain useful and critical perceptions\n\nabout the modern world become more likely\n I want to suggest that it represents a response to successive\n\ndisplacements migrations journeys which have come to constitute these black\n\n special conditions of existence end of quote\n I would like to start as a point of convergence with Gilroy to\n\ncontinue the unearthing of new world performance\n Indeed popular culture and space in the tradition of Kamau\n\nBrathwaite Wilson Harris and Genevi&egrave;ve Fabre who have edged clear\n\nimages of the slave ship dance Limbo in black Atlantic scholarship\n Space is an important element in new world performance\n The Limbo dance highlights the importance of not only the\n\nhistorical but also the spatial imagination\n Emerging out of the lack of space available on the slave ships\n\nhence the slaves bent themselves like spiders\n\n\n  of slave castles such as Elmina Castle with\n\nthe low    thresholds that    the enslaved navigated to move from dungeon to\n\nholding room to the door of no return before boarding the slavers\n In the dance the whole cycle of life is reflected\n Consistent with certain African beliefs the body moves under a pole\n\nheld at chest-level which is consistently lowered as the dancers emerge in\n\nthe triumph of life over death when the dancer\'s head clears the pole\n The slave ships like the plantation and the city reveal or revealed\n\nparticular spaces that produce or produced magical forms of entertainment and\n\nritual\n This historical continuity is evidence in the way movement patterns\n\nlike the Limbo were preserved throughout the last three centuries emerging\n\namong the Jamaican maroons twentieth century Jamaican tourist entertainment\n\nand within Trinidad as a wake dance\n Crucially Limbo also appears in Jamaica\'s popular dancehall culture\n\nin nineteen ninety-four as one of the popular dance moves of that year\n Limbo holds memory and marks continuity among performance practices\n\nof the new world\n First Limbo calls our attention to the dance movement and the space\n\nthat is its limits and potential in which the movement was and still is\n\nperformed\n Secondly it is a ritual of rebirth beyond the slave ship during the\n\nmiddle passage\n It has been linked to puberty and war rituals within Africa to\n\nCongolese cosmology in particular as well as funereal rites\n Similarly the plantation dances and urban dancehall space\n\nmade available to accommodate or encourage them sorry  similarly the\n\nplantation dances and urban dancehall events hold memories of the celebrated\n\naspects of daily life without any space made available to accommodate or\n\nencourage them in policed restricted and marginal settings\n What I have done in previous work is to set up a conversation\n\nbetween Limbo as dance as space as system and as symbol to look at the\n\nparallels common genealogy spatially and performatively with dancehall\n\nperformance in order to develop my argument for the use of a spatial\n\ndiscourse\n I extend that work in this presentation\n I look at the scholarship on and common genealogy among the Blues\n\nDancehall and Kwaito would reveal that some of the same things have been said\n\nabout the performers lyrics role performance practices  raison\n\nd\'&ecircumflex;tre and aesthetics\n What else can be said of the link between Dancehall the Blues and\n\nKwaito\n This evening I will not historicise the main elements of these\n\nforms<,> rather I wish to give a brief description of these forms focussing\n\non their spaces of performance venues and stories they tell about the meaning\n\nof celebration\n I used a combination of secondary sources and primary data\n\ncollected from periods of research in Jamaica and South Africa where\n\ninterviews case studies and participant observation were employed\n The politics of space in Dancehall or Dancehall culture\n The name " Dancehall" implies a spatial nuance\n It first flourished in the nineteen fifties around the consumption\n\nof the emerging popular music especially in Kingston and its name derives \n\n  from the exclusive yards or halls or lawns in\n\nwhich dance events were mainly held<,>\n It is first to be understood as a space in which adults meet to\n\nconsume celebrate entertain and affirm group identity\n Using space as a holistic category for analysing Dancehall\n\nperformance in my early research led to an examination of the venues events\n\nthat occurred in those venues and the culture of celebration in Jamaica as\n\nwell as the dance movement as an under-explored aspect of Dancehall culture\n\nsince the nineteen fifties\n I developed a classification scheme based on characteristic\n\nfeatures degree of commercialisation permanence and hierarchy and associated\n\nwith that analytical categories recurring metaphors spatial descriptors and\n\nphilosophies that characterise the evolution of popular Dancehall culture in\n\nJamaica\n if these apply\n\nto other new world performance cultures I now turn to the Blues and Kwaito<,>\n This section is entitled Jamaica no problem Memphis no trouble\n\nethos of the Blues\n Why the Blues\n Blues busters Blues dance blue beat and Clue J and the Blues\n\nBusters are just some of the indications of the obvious influence the Blues\n\nhad on Jamaican culture\n The influence of the Blues is also evident in the Gleaner\n\nadvertisements that announced the latest Blues records for sale as in the\n\nJuly twenty-six issue nineteen twenty-four\n Among many others that heralded tunes like Mobile Blues and\n\nLimehouse Blues there were many copies of American Big bands with\n\naccompanying fake books that contained the musical repertoire\n Blues was played in the dancehall before Rhythm and Blues and then\n\nSka comes out of the combination of Rhythm and Blues and Jamaican forms such\n\nas Mento\n There is also the lingering influence of the Blues in Rhythm and\n\nBlues which was dominant in the nineteen fifties and continues today in the\n\nstaple of American RnB artists that rotate on the Jamaican airwaves\n But are there any common features outside of the historical link\n\nthrough musical flows\n What is the Blues\n What are the Blues\n how did it move from\n\nplace to place in the early twentieth century\n Around the late nineteenth century thousands of black migrants\n\nexperienced and took advantage of their out of placeness to travel through\n\nthe South place to place wandering in search of work or a sense of new self\n In the face of troubles and problems of the everyday Blacks in the\n\nUnited States Delta region created their music\n ain\'t nothing but a good man feeling\n\nbad end quote is how one singer described it\n The Blues is about no crime just of being human and is seen as an\n\nquote  anodyne for suffering that leaves the musician or listener\n\nfeeling good again end quote\n The experience of American Blacks is bound up in the Blues poverty\n\npolitical disenfranchisement and legal segregation violence of lynchings\n\nbeatings and shootings\n The Blues as a form of expression highlighted such issues as\n\nfrustration lack of love loneliness anger life in the slums rejection many of\n\nthem universal themes\n Blues is also used to mean a way of playing Jazz and sometimes\n\nBlues is synonymous with Jazz\n Albeit the precursor to the Blues and Jazz being the singing and\n\nplaying of instruments in Congo Square in New Orleans the significance of\n\nsuch a context is that it reveal some of the conditions in which enslaved\n\npeoples had their entertainment\n Congo Square performances were supervised by local authorities and\n\nenslaved performers were escorted to the Square and back to the plantation\n Performances included banned African songs because they were\n\nthought to be a part of voodoo rites\n Policed spaces of performance were legitimised by the segregation\n\nlaws resulting after    eighteen ninety-four\n\nin the redirection of social and musical energies or Creoles and Blacks\n Where relatively privileged Creoles lost their jobs due to\n\nsegregation laws blacks gained some as

itself in many shapes<,>\n This belief has been most clearly reflected in the early history of\n\npublic housing in Jamaica<,>\n If we look at the history of public housing from the post-war\n\nperiod it is evident that housing interventions have been influenced by\n\ndifferent and sometimes conflicting philosophies\n These philosophies revolve around three basic questions\n What do the people need\n What do the people deserve\n\n The fourth question of what can the government afford to do is a\n\ndifferent kind of assessment and it enters the picture frontally\n This is in contrast to the first three questions which reflect an\n\nunderlying philosophy that is shaped both by ideology and by social class\n\nbiases but which is often not stated openly\n We take the opportunity of the eighth annual Bob Marley lecture to\n\ninvite you to reflect on the issues of housing and community\n These intertwined issues were best articulated by Bob Marley as he\n\nsung about his own experience growing up in one of the worst examples of\n\npublic housing\n\n We also wish to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the work of\n\nthe Institute of Caribbean Studies and in particular the Reggae Studies Unit\n\nand its    coordinator Professor Carolyn\n\nCooper\n Carolyn's own work has consistently expressed her commitment to\n\nnurturing the culture and particularly the musical heritage of our nation\n\n We invite you to travel backwards with us in time to some of the\n\nfirst large-scale housing developments from the nineteen sixties and the\n\nseventies\n These major housing projects were among the first social\n\ninterventions of independent Jamaica and they reflected the determination to\n\nprovide a better standard of living for the urban poor\n However the design and the implementation of these housing\n\ndevelopments have also served to shape the structure and the character of\n\nsocial life for the low-income urban population\n It is this legacy which sets the framework for how we must now\n\napproach the provision of public housing in two thousand and five\n To complete our journey we must also look forwards to the new\n\ninner-city housing programme being spearheaded by the National Housing Trust\n These housing developments are being implemented after a period of\n\nroughly twenty years when public housing provision was virtually removed from\n\nthe agenda of government\n The government now returns to this national project within an\n\nenvironment that is infinitely more challenging\n These challenges are derived from the sheer volume of demand for\n\nhousing within a limited land space the competing demands for other land use\n\nthe risks of environmental degradation that are attached to poor planning for\n\nwaste disposal and the higher expectations of the people consequent on social\n\nmobility and continuing globalization\n While these are formidable challenges they constitute ones that can\n\nbe addressed by technical skill and adequate financing\n Equally important are the issues which arise from the fact that in\n\npolitical and social terms the Kingston of two thousand and five is radically\n\ndifferent from the Kingston which was the base for the first generation of\n\nleaders who led the country into independence in nineteen sixty-two\n That first group of leaders faced the huge task of trying to build\n\nan urban centre which provided an improved standard of living for the working\n\npoor\n In this economic and social agenda housing was a central plank\n ina\n\nin  totally inadequate housing infrastructure which was\n\nthe result of the neglect and indifference of the colonial period\n However the housing solutions which were implemented during the\n\nfirst two decades after independence have served to rework the structure and\n\nthe nature of urban communities so that Kingston now represents a mosaic of\n\ncommunities with clearly defined boundaries which stand in opposition to each\n\nother<,,>\n Any reference to inner-city housing tends to bring to mind the\n\nconcept of the garrison community which was first advanced by Professor Carl\n\nStone in the eighties\n This concept has also now become fully entrenched in political\n\ndiscourse and it is generally twinned with the concept of tribalism<,>\n Carl Stone's work as we know emphasize the extent to which the\n\npolitical allocation of housing was a critical factor in the spawning of\n\nKingston's garrison communities\n\n\n  and in this regard we think of Barry\n\nChevannes Mark Figueroa and Anthony Harriot\n However the distinctive feature of recent work has been the extent\n\nto which we no longer focus on the garrison communities but instead we view\n\nthis as a dynamic process in which communities become more or less garrisoned\n This is a process which involves homogeneous groups in communities\n\nwhich stand in opposition to other communities so that communities are\n\nsurrounded by zones of peace zones of accommodation and zones of conflict\n Tony Harriot points out that this system of inter-community\n\nrelationships is no longer limited to the traditional garrisons but that it\n\nis a pattern that can be observed in many other inner-city areas\n For all of these communities the result is the same\n\n\nbecome locked into a situation of forced isolation and their social    and economic opportunities start to contract\n It is for this reason that in two thousand and five housing\n\nprovision can no longer be just about housing provision\n It is not possible to plan for housing without planning for\n\ncommunity\n What this means is that if housing developments are to be\n\nsustainable they must integrate planning for three  \n\ndifferent sets of issues\n The first is the housing the physical infrastructure and the\n\ninstitutional management arrangements\n The second is economic viability and the third is community\n\nstructure and relationships<,>\n The journey on which we invite you to embark follows an imaginary\n\npathway\n This pathway takes us from the government yard in Trench Town to\n\nthe high-rise barracks of Rema and also to the carefully planned community of\n\nTivoli Gardens\n Both of these two were constructed in the sixties\n We then want to travel eastwards to McIntyre Villas in central\n\nKingston where a squatter community struggled to hold on to the land on which\n\nit had been settled by the Methodist Church from the turn of the twentieth\n\ncentury\n Their own efforts were complemented by the voluntary contributions\n\nof many social activists and community workers who supported their struggle\n This was matched by the commitment of a team of young architects\n\nresulting in an outstanding working class housing development in the mid\n\nseventies<,>\n As we travel through these communities we must also pause to listen\n\nto the voices of the residents to share their own understanding of life in\n\ntheir communities their joys their conflicts and their dissatisfactions<,>\n But while we travel on this journey we also need to look at the\n\npeople we leave behind the people who could not get a ticket on the\n\ndevelopment train\n These are the families who remained in the decaying nineteenth\n\ncentury buildings in West Kingston<,> the people whose homes were bulldozed\n\nto make room for new housing the squatter communities that were simply pushed\n\nfurther out closer to a new  dungle\n These households could not politely disappear simply because they\n\nhad not been able to qualify for new housing\n They remained there in West Kingston and on the outskirts of the\n\ncity and as the agricultural economy declined they were joined by more of\n\ntheir rural cousins\n Accordingly at the beginning of this new century housing provision\n\nremained a huge intractable issue\n It is because we cannot turn our eyes away from this population\n\nthat was left behind that we will fast forward our journey to look at the new\n\npublic housing project designed by the National Housing Trust for the inner\n\ncities<,>\n While we fast forward from the seventies to the nineties to the\n\nbeginning of this twenty-first century we must nonetheless point out that the\n\ndecade of the eighties and the nineties were not periods of stagnation as is\n\nfrequently stated\n This period also saw an expansion of the country's housing stock\n\nbut these were not government housing in the true sense of the word\n These developments included the massive expansion of Portmore with\n\npublic sector support through a government guaranteed mortgage insurance and\n\nof course it included the Sites and Services Projects which were initiated\n\nunder strong pressure from external agencies the World Bank and U S A I D\n However as the housing analysts have frequently pointed out the\n\noverwhelming emphasis on Sites and Services did little to address the\n\nproblems of the much larger numbers of persons   \n\nwho remained in the decaying areas of the city\n\n\ndowntown Kingston<,,>\n As we look at these different developments and we try in retrospect\n\nto assess what was the vision which inspired the persons who designed these\n\npublic housing developments it must be acknowledged that we are ourselves\n\nguided by our own philosophy\n We would want to feel that this is a universal philosophy but it is\n\nnonetheless important that these elements should be spelled out clearly at\n\nthis stage\n Our housing philosophy has six basic tenants\n\n\nand a sense of dignity\n Two people need a space for interaction\n Three people need a sense of security\n Four people need to be able to protect their children\n Five people need a sense of ownership and six people need to be\n\nable to take pride in their surroundings\n Throughout our journey we will pause to note how these issues were\n\naddressed in different versions of the government yard",

issues\n\nparticularly as some Cubans say when the   \n\neconomic  cake gets smaller<,> the racial fight gets\n\ntougher<,>\n it's a\n\nlittle  it is a different type of superstructure<,>\n The positive in the Caribbean situation is that there is much in\n\nthe West Indies that makes you not question your humanity<,>\n many West Indians\n although your\n\nhumanity  <,>  is questioned and is offended by<,>\n\nthe circumstances of existence uh particularly by people lower socioeconomic\n\nuh groups<,>\n may very well\n\nbe a certain complacency at home<,> a certain sloppiness<,> in<,>

Indian complacency at home<,> and a certain naivety\n\nabroad<,> where racial factors impinge directly on one's life<,>\n a friend of mine a black Cuban colleague of West\n\nIndian migrant origin who works at Saint Augustine<,> is violently opposed to\n\nthe concept of the West Indies<,> seeing it as a British colonial concept<,>\n most people seem\n\ncomfortable with it<,> although    I found some\n\npresenters<,> substituting Caribbean<,> for West Indian<,> as if in a\n\nsubconscious critique<,>\n But that subconscious critique hasn't been articulated as a\n\nrejection of the West Indies\n It has been articulated by saying we\x18re talking about Caribbean\n\nidentity<,>\n I think the comfort level that we have arises from the fact that we\n\nknow that the West Indian identity about which we speak<,> is not the same as\n\nthe West Indian identity of colonial times<,> although the legacies of the\n\npast are very much present<,>\n\n\nover time and space<,>\n\n\nin  on the notion reconstituting<,> how cultures reconstitute\n\nthemselves over time and space<,>\n it has been reconstituted within the West Indies in\n\nthe popularity of Dancehall music through the region among the young<,> as\n\nwell as in the West Indian diasporas in Britain and Canada<,>\n These forces of reconstitution is one of the most important\n\ndimensions of West Indian identity and understanding<,>\n is seen in West Indies prose\n\nfiction and probably the two most important<,> novels in this regard are\n\nGeorge Lamming's  In the Castle of My Skin and Vidiadhar\n\nNaipaul\x18s

go into the\n\nquestion itself in the paper<,>\n\n I share the view that proverbs are of philosophical interest and\n\nimportant<,> as a part of my general outlook<,> uh on philosophy<,>\n My strategy will be to try and show that there are Jamaican\n\nproverbs<,> which are interesting<,> from the point of view of at least<,>\n\nfour areas of philosophy<,> metaphysics<,> epistemology<,> ethics and\n\naesthetics<,>\n It is not my contention that these areas exhaust all the\n\npossibilities<,>\n that there are many\n\nphilosophically interesting proverbs<,> which I do not know about<,>\n\n\n look at a number of the proverbs that seem\n\nto me to be<,> metaphysically interesting<,>\n which is probably the most\n\ndifficult to define<,> partly because the word "\n\nmetaphysics"<,> refers to a variety of philosophical activities<,>\n to mean attempts at making general\n\nstatements<,> about the nature of existence<,> or reality<,>\n metaphysical inquiry aims at fundamental\n\ntruths<,> about the nature of things<,>\n some say\n\nthe most    fundamental area of\n\nphilosophy in that it deals with<,> uh for example ontology deals with what\n\nexists<,>\n come up with the most general

exists<,> before you can deal with\n\nhow you know what exists<,,>\n I shall now examine some of the proverbs which seem to me to be\n\nmetaphysically interesting<,>\n\n\nthere is an element of fatalism in the proverb<,>   Wha\n\nfor you caan\x18 be un for you<,> which means<,> what is\n\nyours<,> cannot otherwise but be yours<,><,,>\n\n\nand that is  <,>  a theory in

eventually<,>\n function of the\n\nproverb<,>\n\n A good deal of philosophical reflection has been done on the nature\n\nof time<,>\n we\n\nall think that we know what time is<,> but as someone will ask you what is\n\ntime and you think about it<,> you realize that you don\'t know<,>\n these are the very interesting philosophers on the\n\nquestion of time<,> but there\'s a good deal of philosophical literature on\n\nthe nature of time<,>\n One characteristic of time that has received the attention of both\n\nphilosophers and scientists<,> is its apparent irreversibility<,>\n\n\nnowadays who argue that in theory<,> but not in practice<,> there is a reason\n\nfor  <- > thinking  saying that it must be reversible<,>\n\n\nPlantain ripe can\'t green

greenness<,>\n\n of\n\nall perceived reality<,,>\n\n One of the most fundamental concepts that we use to think about the\n\nworld is the notion of causation<,,>\n or states of\n\naffairs<,> such that the first brings about<,> the second<,>\n\n\n you never see smoke\n\nwithout fire<,,>\n\n and between any\n\nalleged cause and effect<,> poses well-known philosophical problems which are\n\npresupposed by the proverb<,>\n\n Some scientists say this is not always the case at the atomic\n\nlevel<,>\n one event make the occurrence of another\n\nevent necessary<,>\n rejected the notion of\n\nphysical necessity and argued<,> that the notion of causation is mainly<,> a\n\nmatter of the mind<,>\n that the concept was necessary for a\n\nscientific understanding of the world<,>\n as a gateway to the puzzling\n\nissue<,> of causal connection<,> a topic with important implications<,> for\n\nmany areas of thought<,> and one which is widely debated<,> by\n\nphilosophers<,,>\n\n for belief in the existence of\n\nGod<,> has been one of the preoccupations of metaphysics<,>\n Conceptions of God are obviously an important part of this\n\nprocess<,>\n\n in\n\nJamaican

knowledge<,>\n\n\n\nGod Almighty know why I\'m broke fal wing<,>\n God Almighty know why I\'m broke fal\n\nwing\n\n is seen as the source of\n\nboth good and evil<,> because of the proverb which

the\n\nopportunities for personal growth<,> which exist here in the university<,>\n and I've chosen to\n\nreflect on three channels to growth<,> of which I am aware<,> namely<,> one\n\ncareer opportunities<,> two training and development opportunities<,> and\n\nthree opportunities for<,> recognition of one's work and the excellence of\n\none's work<,>\n I think it's important to remind

her<,>   to be a member of the university\n\nor to occupy any position<,> in or on the staff of the\n\nuniversity<,>\n So the first point then that I want to make is that we are\n\nassured<,> that the

north-western peninsula of Trinidad<,>\n leading eventually\n\nto the surrender of hostages and arrest of the mutineers<,>\n The background to nineteen seventy can be seen as resulting out of\n\na series of connected but relatively autonomous developments<,>\n Real wages starting from a base of zero in nineteen fifty-six at\n\nfirst increased<,> reaching a high of fourteen per cent in nineteen

but the events of nineteen seventy were not initiated\n\nby uprising from below<,>\n While there were distinct moments in the previous decade when\n\ntrade union disputes dominated the national agenda<,> this was not the case\n\nin nineteen seventy<,>\n In sixty-five for example the threatened unification of island\n\nsugar workers had led to the government declaring a state of

George Williams<,>\n\nUniversity<,>\n The student march of February twenty-six had been a tiny affair\n\nconfined to radical undergraduates<,> eminently forgettable but for the fact\n\nthat the section of the marchers invaded the nearby Roman Catholic\n\ncathedral<,> and proceeded to give speeches and engage in dialogue<,> with\n\nthe resident priests<,>\n What happened a week later was therefore unprecedented and\n\nentirely unexpected<,>\n In support of five students and four non-students who had been\n\narrested for disorderly    conduct in a\n\nplace of worship<,> a mammoth black

sugar factory went on strike<,> as sugar oil transport and\n\nelectricity workers planned to join Black Power groups<,> for an April\n\ntwenty-first<,> general strike and march on Port-of-Spain<,>\n It was out of fear of the likely results of a general strike which\n\nled the government to declare a state of emergency on April twenty-first<,>\n\nthe act which precipitated the mutiny in the army<,>\n But before examining that signal event we need to characterise the\n\nnature of the movement from February twenty-six to April twenty-one<,>\n Middle-class university students had their own social and\n\npolitical agenda<,>\n The nationalist movement led by the P N M and Eric Williams was\n\npredominantly<,> Afro-Trinidadian in its character<,> but there was a\n\ndefinite and justifiable

Graham\n Words of strength to our sister Charmaine Bowman keyboardist who\n\nrecently lost her partner and father of her infant son our beloved brother\n\nCarl Ayton\n\n The oppression of women has transcended the boundaries of race\n\nreligion class culture and has been an unfortunate feature of various ages\n It was not too long ago that we women in the western and parts of\n\nthe eastern world were considered chattels\n The inequality in the workplace and professional arenas has been\n\nfor too long been tilted in favour of the male\n The Jamaican music industry is no exception\n In fact here the imbalance seems to be intensified\n This phenomenon is another of the tragic legacies of the ways of\n\nthe former slave masters whose bad and dirty habits have remained with too\n\nmany of us for far too long\n\n\npresent to you the title of my presentation\n No pumpum no music deal male manipulation of\n\nwomen in the Jamaican music industry<,,>\n The horror stories concerning some Jamaican female artists are\n\nnumerous nasty and oftentimes tragic\n It would be easy but dangerous to call names\n It is certainly unnecessary\n Let me make it clear that it is not my intention to point\n\naccusatory fingers and issue edicts of judgement and condemnation\n That cannot solve the problem\n In our celebration of this day we want to acknowledge that there is\n\na problem to examine it and try to implement a solution\n is a graphic\n\nreference to the behaviour of some record producers towards our female\n\nartists\n\n\nFeel  de riddim written by myself with contributions\n\nby Joy Dixon who is here in the audience today\n In the script the central character Shary an up-coming artist is\n\nelated when Dunman a top record producer listens to her sing and agrees to\n\nrecord her\n soon turns to\n\ndismay and disgust after Dunman attaches the condition of a trip to Montego\n\nBay for the weekend\n No pumpum no music deal you say I\n\nlike the voice but I feel your feel I'll wheel your wheel and I reel you for\n\nreal I just no pumpum no music deal\n The actual song will be played at the end of my presentation\n Shary walks out of Dunman's studio and maintains her dignity\n The real life scenario is not always so easy\n I once listened to a popular female artist being interviewed on the\n\nradio\n When asked the question as to whether sex played a part in the\n\nrelationships between artist and producer the singer candidly admitted that\n\nsexual attraction is a common phenomenon because man is man and woman is\n\nwoman\n And of course there is nothing wrong with sexual attraction\n It is as natural as breathing\n However when as is so often the case the record producer requires\n\nan artist to sleep with him in order to be recorded then the situation\n\nbecomes ugly and    manipulative\n Of course the scenario may not be so cut and dry\n The woman may be courted and feel that she's in a genuine\n\nrelationship only to be cut loose and put out to pasture<,> when the man\n\ntires of her or moves on to the next artist\n Or he may secretly become her sexual partner especially when\n\nmarried and relegate the artist to the status of concubine\n If and when the artist ends the sexual relationship then the record\n\nproduction also ceases<,>\n It may be that a producer may begin to record an artist apparently\n\nin good faith and somewhere along the line he begins to put question to her\n\nor to behave in a sexually harassing manner\n If she does not give in to these advances then there will be no\n\nfurther recording\n Of course this is not to say that all male record producers are\n\nguilty of sexual harassment or that successful female artists have slept with\n\ntheir producers\n There are producers who do work with female artists and maintain a\n\nstrictly professional relationship and most women do walk away from obnoxious\n\nand    inappropriate behaviour\n\n\ncareers will tell you that they have always been treated with the\n\nutmost respect by their male counterparts and I am sure that they have earned\n\nit\n But then the issue of male manipulation is not a myth or a figment\n\nof our imagination\n It is an unfortunate fact of life which greatly contributes to the\n\nimbalance which exists in the Jamaican music industry\n At the recent launch of Angie Angel's C D guest speaker Mr Desmond\n\nYoung president of the Jamaica Federation of Musicians wryly commented that\n\nthe status of our female artists is disheartening\n They just seem to disappear after years\n\n   of trying and not succeeding\n Sometimes it is those closest to the artist who cause damage to\n\ntheir careers\n As Bob Marley sings your best friend can indeed be your worst enemy\n Almost invariably the husband or boy-friend becomes the manager of\n\nhis bow\n It matters not that he has neither the experience or knowledge of\n\nthe industry nor the wisdom to find out\n All him no say I him control fi him uman business cause I\n\nfi him uman\n Control that is the crux of the matter\n as soon as Shary\n\ngets a hit song her boy-friend presents her with a management contract\n\nwhereby he attempts to manage her for life\n far fetched comical even\n\nbut it is a sad fact of some  musical journey\n I have seen a management contract where the so-called manager\n\nstipulated a life-time management of the artist concerned\n These days such a contract would be seen as oppressive in a court\n\nof law\n\n\nregatively  relatively recent years that a better and more\n\ncomplete understanding has come about in the music industry regarding\n\nlegitimate and equitable practices largely through the efforts of the J F M\n\nand their educational seminars as well as the passing of the copyright act\n becomes a damager\n Due to his inability or unwillingness to properly promote and\n\nhandle the affairs of the artist the growth of the artist becomes stunted and\n\nas Desi Young says the artist just disappears\n\n\nmanager's spouse to deliberately hold back the artist\n Stardom means exposure to richer men to international travel\n\npossibly fame and fortune\n Not many men can handle this only the unenlightened few\n If we track the careers of some of the more prominent female\n\nartists who    seemingly could have gone much\n\nfurther more often than not we would find some guy hovering in the background\n\nor indeed very much up front who has deliberately stifled the career of his\n\nbeloved by not taking advantage of opportunities as they present themselves\n\n\nw  with predominantly women artists told me that some\n\nyears ago he had tried to record a popular Jamaican female artist\n His efforts were in vain\n Her husband manager decided that his wife was not going to England\n\nto work for no producer and so she did not\n Neither was she able to work for other producers as she would have\n\nliked nor to go on tour when she was in demand\n One of our hit-making singles was stunned when after some fifteen\n\nyears as a performing and recording artist someone saw her in the supermarket\n\nand enquired  you still a sing\n It was a very loud wake-up call\n She too has always been managed by her husband\n Not only does this artist have the talent creativity required to be\n\na tremendous success she also had the look\n What you ask is the look\n The look is pretty sexy good-looking and let us not forget young\n In this business many producers are not interested in recording a\n\nfemale artist over the age of twenty-one\n And twenty-one seem kind of old too\n There seems to be no such age barrier where male artists are\n\nconcerned\n Quite a few brethren have been known to bust in their thirties or\n\neven forties\n\n I was negotiating a contract for a female artist who was required\n\nto make an overseas appearance for a video shoot\n She was so concerned that she had to quote her age for the purpose\n\nof the work permit\n At twenty-eight years old the singer was worried that they would\n\nconsider her too old\n Yes you have to look good as a woman\n Some years ago I participated in a television discussion programme\n\non female artists\n\n\npretty and can't sing\n And therefore clearly had an advantage over those who can sing but\n\nnot pretty\n Our standards of beauty have for far too long been dictated by\n\nwestern ideals woven from fantasy material<,,>\n And our female singers have been victimised by those who perpetuate\n\nthis distorted illusion\n Reggae music has traditionally been viewed as a protest music a\n\nmessage music a message that has parried the revolution broken down barriers\n\nand set the captives free\n When Winnie Mandela visited Jamaica some two years ago in\n\naddressing a gathering of women Sister Winnie said quote  It was\n\nreggae music that kept us going\n Mrs Mandela told us that reggae music had such a powerful influence\n\non the    oppressed black revolutionaries that\n\nit was banned by the authorities in South Africa\n\n Give thanks and praises the apartheid system crashed and Jamaican\n\nreggae music stands tall as a small axe felling a big tree\n Similarly Dancehall music is very much male turf with the male\n\nartists showing their prowess on stage strutting preening and crowing like\n\nroosters and sometimes actually ending up in genuine cock-\n\nfights<,>\n\n\nenjoy such performances oblivious to the fact that lyrics are often violent\n\nand demeaning to women\n So then reggae music was seen as a man music produced by a man\n\nperformed by a man promoted by a man and marketed by a man\n A man thing\n how when certain man a reason them\n\nthe two one the uman ina them argument likewise the reggae arena has\n\nnot been seen to be a fit and proper place for a woman\n Long hours hanging around the studio day after day night after\n\nnight has been the history of many a successful male artist\n Until finally one night him a sit and sing a song Mr Big Producer\n\npass and hear him and his days of hanging  <- >  \n\naround are over and he is on the road to stardom\n No the studio rat life is inappropriate impractical and indeed may\n\nbe dangerous for a woman\n western\n\nman  western standards because a man can always incorporate\n\nhis looks into his act and be beloved by all regardless of a big belly a\n\nbroad nose\n\n Another area of imbalance is with the performers themselves\n\n It is not unusual to find the main artists supported by several\n\nother artists all male if indeed there is a female presence it may be in the\n\nform of backing vocalists or a half-naked dancer\n Somehow lead women artists have no place on the stage of the crew\n And what with all defy upon this and defy upon that\n One wonders why the brethrens don't encourage more female presence\n\non stage", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '33d51fbe-72db-4d18-a515-955c73f47ea1', 'added':
