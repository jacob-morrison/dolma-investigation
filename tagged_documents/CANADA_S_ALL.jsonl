going to volunteer on\n\nFriday  \n can't\n\n work a five day work week    into your life  , like I'm doing <unclear> word\n\n</unclear> and <unclear> word </unclear>    in  \n\nJune  ,  and I'm

back to the community or is going to this conference\n\ngiving something back to the community\n\n<$B>  Well I think you have to follow your instincts and that you\n\nsaid  not at present time  it's the same as me not going to\n\nVancouver\n\n<$A>  Mhhm\n\n<$B>  it's\n\ngood for my career, it's good for me, personally but it was the wrong\n\ntime\n\n<$A> \n Ya the timing was wrong\n\n<$B>  So I really uhm,\n\n<$A>  having a difficulty\n\ntying myself down to one thing so maybe    I wouldn't be\n\n  somebody that would get, full throttle, into, uhh one\n\narea of my life because I just want

because  of\n\nwhat's going on with  Arnie   Uhha  \n\n<$B>  Or whether I just don't have it\n\n<$A>  That's an interesting question\n\n<$B>  words\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nother things that we put

that\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n<$A>  Ya, it's really pretty\n Uh, that's a very interesting question,\n We might not ever know the answer to that the fact that, how\n\ndo you set yourself up,   <unclear> words </unclear>  interest\n\nis\n\n<$B> \n\na   a   safety net for me  ,   and you know\n\nwhat\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  and you're just not\n\n  interested \n\n<$B>  interested, yup\n\n<$B>  It's interesting\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  it's something I've\n\nnever got to    before   and I've been meaning\n\nto ask\n It's been asked\n and uhm\n\n<,,> I would say two of it are not, excited, by it\n They're not excited by the academic part of it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n   academic   part of anything I've been involved\n\nin\n I used to love going to the library and doing things\n I'm not excited by the, technical part of it, because I've\n\ndone it all before\n\n<$A> \n\natmosphere you know <unclear> word </unclear>   because of \n\nconflict between the research work that you're doing  ,    and the    clinical work you're doing    it is   causing\n\n\n  but driving a wedge in   <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  made\n\nme uncomfortable because    it's the

as I'm pretty organized all the time I have to really\n\n  <unclear> word </unclear> / [ >  \n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> like a place    that's \n\n well organized\n They don't like the

that for you\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nthe system to do that for you   \n\n<$B> \n\n\n\nwords </unclear> , that would be   structure to deal with\n\nchaos \n\n<$A>  a nice confusion\n\n \n\n<$A> \n Ya, Well\n\n<$B>  So you know, there are steps to take\n\n\n  it doesn't   happen there\n\n\n<$A>  it happen at the other clinic that you\n\nworked at\n\n<$B>  Mhhm\n\n<$A>  Do you miss that\n\n<$B>  Mhhm\n\n<$A>  Uhha\n Could you go back and work there\n\n<$A>  Ya, but I don't want to back and work there\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n  entirely  \n\n<$A>  types\n\nof work that you've been doing with

 Well\n\n<$B>  Uh huh\n Everytime I go down there I just, you know I just try to,\n\nrealize what it's all going to look like\n\n<$A>  Of course to make it even bigger you could knock that

huh\n\n<$A> \n\na vacation\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A> \n\ngoing to   do that with the last two weeks in July right\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  fly out\n\n\n July,\n\n<$B> \n\n  discuss   the stairs\n\n<$A>  Stairs now\n\n<$B> \n\n\nbe   in day camp the first two weeks, of vacation, I'm still\n\nthinking maybe    if you    want\n\nto     do this work\n\n<$A>  Is it their vacation\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  The last week of June and the first week of July\n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  word\n\n</unclear>\n\n<$B>  Yah\n\n<$A>  June\n\n<$A>  think the last day of the\n\nweek is a Thursday right\n\n<$B>  Thursday or Friday yeah\n\n<$A>  So uh Thursday's June, twenty, - ninth, June\n\nthirtieth is the Friday\n is\n\nwhen the kids   okay  the  kids   are in day camp \n\n,  that week already\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  And day camp they got one more week after that\n And that's when you think we should do the stairs\n\n<$B>  Yeah,,\n\n<$A>  Uhmm, so what you want me to take a week off of work and\n\ndo the stairs is that the idea\n\n<$B>  Yeah,\n\n<$A>  thought we\n\ncould do with the stairs, is try to spread it out  over a couple\n\nof weekends,\n\n<$B> , over several\n\nweekends\n I'd rather we get it done\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  spread it\n\nover weekends\n\n\n<$A> \n\n, \n\n<$B>  I really don't\n Either hire somebody to do it, or else, we do it in one shot\n And we hire somebody to work with you,\n A helper\n\n<$A>  Sh,,\n Anyway, I'm not sure\n\n\n , the stairs   okay, the problem is\n\n<,> the  long room  upstairs\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A> \n\nlong room  done before we touch the stairs,\n The reason being that we're definitely having the, floor sanded\n\nin the kitchen\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  Uhmm\n\n<$B>  In August\n\n<$A>  Uhmm yeah\n August\n,\n\ndone at the same time\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  If the stairs, for whatever reason, can't be done by\n\nthen, then keep it in mind that the stairs probably  won't be  a uh\n\nuh    separate   issue\n we can do them after,\n\nbecause we're not    going to   be sanding them\n\nat the same time\n\n\ngonna   going to   do ourselves\n sanding the\n\nkitchen\n\n sand it\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  words\n\n</unclear>\n I, uhn\n\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  Okay but the stairs\n\n the stairs and do all\n\nthe work on it  why do we want   kids roaming round the\n\nhouse,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  going to\n\n  <unclear> word </unclear> or fall down the stairs or  \n\nsomething \n\n<$B> \n\nbe a mess\n be a mess,\n\n<$A>  What mess is that\n a little dusty work\n Okay\n\n\nkind of   work where    you   have to\n\n<unclear> words </unclear> tear out the carpets\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n the\n\nstairs\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  sharpened scraper\n\nwill only   You can actually do a, pretty, clean job scraping\n\nthat glue off okay  \n\n<$B>  Why do you have to scrape to take the uh glue off, if we're\n\n   going to   get rid of that wood anyway,\n\n<$A> \n\ngoing to   do the whole thing, in one week\n\n\nword </unclear>  laundry room  in that week and  we'll have to \n\n  ladder    walk up and down the stairs during\n\nthat week okay,\n how many,\n\nsteps we'll get done, how many days it's    going to\n\n  take us    to   do the entire staircase\n\nokay\n Basically I think that you for you know over two or three days,\n\nyou're    going to   have   \n\nhalf   of your new staircase in place while the other half of your\n\nstaircase is   ah  ,   still   there\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  scrub the\n\nglue off, and  get  all the glue off and then we're    going to   be throwing that stuff away then why should take\n\nthe glue\n\n<$A>  not such a good job getting all\n\nthe glue off\n you sharpen the\n\nscraper  quite a bit  it comes off    quite \n\n uh cleanly\n idea is really, first\n\nget rid of all the carpet, glue, all the dirty stuff\n Then we've got these bare, wooden stairs here,\n gonna\n\n  going to   be over a few weekends\n maybe the bottom, two\n\nstairs or the bottom half of it,\n aah the next six\n\nsteps\n we'd have\n\n the other six steps\n\n\n<$B>  take a week each\n\n<$B>  Take a week\n\n\nbe  when we  do something else,\n\n<$A> , I could, take, maybe, a couple of extra days off\n Okay\n take\n\n a  whole week off\n\n\nwords </unclear>\n I got four weeks of vacation okay this year\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  I don't feel like giving up a whole week of my vacation,\n\nto uhm,    do up our  house \n\n<$B> \n\ntaking the carpet off   <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$A>  what I'm saying\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  that\n\n<,> we, do as much as we can of it\n\n\nthat you know, ahh you can get out of the way\n\n\n  spare time   in the weekends\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  Okay\n And then when you're ready for the big part of the job okay,\n\n   replacing   the actual steps and all\n\nthat and carpentry okay\n words\n\n</unclear> you wouldn't    want to   spread it\n\nover, you know too many weekends that I could do it in and it could take\n I could do that in two long weekends\n Okay I could take maybe, a Monday off, two weeks in a row\n take a Monday off and a Friday off\n\n<$B>  the weekends in July or when do\n\nyou think you're    going to   do this,\n\n<$A>  Uh I could do it maybe I could do it in June or uh\n\n<$B>  that\n\n   in July   when they're in camp,\n You know\n\n\n  going to   be in  camp then we should probably\n\nuse that time, as much \n\nas possible, to get stuff done\n\n Ask him if he wants\n\nsome\n\n<$A> \n\n  I   yeah\n do it that week we\n\ncan do it that week\n What I'm saying is that if we get started before\n the\n\ncarpet  and at least  get that out of the way\n\n, uhm yeah we'll do that\n want to\n\n  do <unclear> words </unclear> the kids <unclear> words </unclear>\n\n\n<$B> \n Okay so, so what do we have here,\n\n<$A> , A hamper\n\n want\n\nto    try and size up, exactly what's involved okay\n\n\n<,> taking these carpets off then I can take a closer look at, what shape\n\n<,> the stairs are in, how much work is involved okay,\n How capable I am of doing it myself\n Okay once I can do that, I'll have a better idea,\n how capable I am of\n\ndoing it myself okay\n I might to be able to do it myself and uhhh,\n If I run into like more like technical difficulties okay things\n\nthat uh, ah I just  don't have  the experience or the knowledge to\n\nknow how to solve the problem, maybe I'll uh ask  Marcel  <unclear>\n\nwords </unclear>\n gimme\n\n  give me   some advice, uh for around fifty bucks an hour\n\nwe'll  do that  okay\n But uh, I don't really think, okay that I need, a helper\n\nfor the physical part of the work okay,\n\n\n do one step at a time and <unclear> words </unclear> one step at a time\n\nokay\n word\n\n</unclear> the stairs and the other one guy  going  down the stairs\n\n  okay \n\n<$B>  okay\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\nword </unclear> those stairs  over  the railings, you know\n\n<$A>  do them

\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> that stuff  a  friend    there's this  ,\n Basically there's two advantages okay one is that you don't have\n\nto pay for it up front,\n Uh, but, in working with it, since you're not paying for\n\nit, you can be up front with somebody else\n saving it for\n\nyourself so you can do it, yourself\n\n<$B>  Mm\n\n<$A>  Over a longer period of time which, is when you save money\n\n<,>   okay \n\n<$B> \n your house\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n Well the thing is I mean you know yeah\n you're just going to put\n\nit off for  a year  you

pay\n\ninterest   on it \n\n<$B> \n So what else did you say\n That's it\n\n<$A> \n yeah, trying to, knock the\n\nprice down\n it's\n\ngoing to   be a major effort <unclear> word </unclear>\n have to\n\nput a lot of time into trying to, trim a lot more of these <unclear> word\n\n</unclear> he's talking about,\n expensive himself okay\n\n<,>\n going to\n\n  try to, go back and negotiate   ,

second\n where does it you know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  and I were actually\n\n  we were looking at apartments on the weekend, and we went into\n\nthis one place where    one of them   was obviously\n\na jazz, like a musician and they had like all this jazz    stuff   you know posters and things around and, very\n\nexpensive audio equipment and  Josh  said, this would be great for\n\nthieves you

then, you know\n\n<,>\n Well it was a very very expensive piece of equipment they had and\n\nthey weren't home\n\n<$A>  So,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Hey\n\n\ngoing to    finance on  you you

\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  They're only between uhm De Maisonneuve and Sherbrooke so you\n\nhave to go around and come back up\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B> , And uh, er they're mostly duplexes if they're\n Down towards De Maisonneuve and the tracks there're a few kind of\n\nbuildings and stuff but, the upper part of the street is almost always\n\nduplexes\n And it just happened in such a flukey way\n\n We started looking Thursday night like seriously you know and\n We called around and we saw one dive on Thursday\n\n\nwords </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\n what\n\n\n<$B>  was just revolting\n the bell we were\n\n already  running late and we  rang the bell and uhm,\n enormous dogs came barreling towards\n\nthe door  jumping on us and     like   they would eat the baby you   know \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  And uhm, there's a woman\n This tiny little woman was, struggling to control these huge\n\ndogs\n She finally got, the worst one of the two and locked it in the\n\nbathroom\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  the apartment you\n\nwere looking at\n\n<$B> \n the apartment we were looking at,\n And as we uhm, as we looked at the place he was like,\n\nlungeing at the  door\n\n\njumping up and    trying to   bite  Dana  's\n\nfoot or whatever\n\n\nyou know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nplace that had about two windows\n The whole interior of the apartment was, completely dark\n, No skylights no windows nothing\n And uh just really you know those kind of places that have, uhm\n\n<,> phone wire kind of painted and crusted to the baseboards \n\n   \n\n<$A>  here\n\n<$B> , but worse\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B> \n\n , they've been   painted about fifty\n\nmillion times so they're about this thick   and uhm \n\n<$A>  they've been\n\nbroken into a few times cos they\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n the woman herself had\n\nbeen fixing up the place but, it was one of those sort of, jobs where\n\nthe landlord says oh you can finish the basement if you want, you know \n And you're sort of thinking uh, no thanks\n\n<$A>  two levels\n\nthere\n\n<$B>  the\n\n  the   lower but    that was\n\njust   just   hideous \n\n<$A>  that they gave\n\nyou \n\n<$B> \n\na fluke\n It was ah, a friend of a friend and we just happened to go to\n\nthis woman's house and say    we   stopped by to\n\nvisit for a minute and we said you know do you know of any places around\n she\n\nsaid do you know of anything around    and   this\n\nwoman said, yeah when do you want it for I'm moving in July and my place\n\nis great\n And we went to look at it and it is really nice\n It's beautiful\n\n<$A>  kind of\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B>  a\n\nsix and a half\n It's really big\n It's got a deck in the back like\n the upper floor but they\n\nshare the deck  , with  the main floor   \n nice\n They have kids\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  It backs onto an alley that's full of kids and really nice\n\n\n<$A> \n\nonto an alley that's full of rats\n\n<$B>  Full of children playing,\n And uh it's really big it's got a beautiful bathroom with an\n\nold-fashioned tub   but it's been  fixed up\n\nit's got new windows   and \n\n<$A>  would you compare it to the place you got\n\nnow\n\n<$B>  Oh, tons better\n got some of the\n\nsame things like stained glass windows and stuff but, it's in much better\n\nshape\n\n<$A>  Oh really\n\n\n<$B> \n It's beautiful\n it's in a great spot\n\n<$A>  allowed to ask\n\nwhat it's worth\n\n<$B>  actually cheap\n It's six sixty-five heated\n\n<$A> , Wow\n\n<$B>  oth\n\n\n looked at one that was lovely but it was seven ninety,\n\nyou know\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Where'd you see it\n\n<$B>  On Regent\n\n\n<$A> \n are looking\n\nfor   , well a   place\n they only have\n\nthe one well the one, income   and \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And they looked at places that are sort of eight nine hundred\n They are, closer to where we are\n\n<$B>  Yeah, yeah\n\n\nsigh  it seems a lot farther away, unless you drive, all the \n\n time \n You know what I mean\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  we can't\n\nnecessarily   always do that  ,  so\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  like where we are\n\nexactly where we are, I think    is   being\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n like Sherbrooke\n I like the street\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  Cos when you walk down the street there's lots of things to\n\npoke around   at \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  like where we are cos it's\n\nvery, uh very uh    alive  \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> , you know\n\nall the services cos you've got  the park I've got  <unclear> words\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$B>  Yeah, yeah,\n\n<$B>  not exactly where you are but\n\nmore like   Westbourne  Rosedale\n And those streets\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  too far\n\n   you feel\n\n \n I\n\ndon't feel uh  ,    sort of   cut off\n\nbecause we're right on  on the main\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  You know it's easier not taking the car\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n\n<$A>  you go a little deeper\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  Like even if you go down to uhm, you know on our street\n\n<,> or our type of street, but   closer to the  park\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  walk\n\n<$B>  No\n\n<$A>  around\n\nFielding\n\n\nthrough  the uh\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n The other thing that I wasn't crazy about, I mean I like your\n\nstreet and  that  with the houses on them but    the\n\n  streets we looked at with apartments they were all sort of modern\n\n<,> like sixties   kind of  apartments\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n had more of a feel of like apartment buildings even though they were\n\nonly duplexes  ,\n they had this sort of, like uhm, you know,\n\nthat kind of flooring tile up the stairs and\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  You know what I mean\n was more\n\n  apartmenty feeling\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  But the only thing is this place I mean the woman is,\n\nninety-nine percent sure she's moving to Colorado but, if she flakes out\n\non us at the last minute we're    going to   be\n\n ,  uh upset yes\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n  a ninety day   clause in her lease\n almost positive she's\n\ngoing\n to like to\n\nkeep her options open a little bit   and  I   \n\nkind of   know her, my mother    sort of \n\n knows her\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  going\n\nto   work out\n n\n\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Yeah\n And it was perfect for us too the

are   \n\ngoing to   happen\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  rented\n\n  this one that was seven ninety\n It was a beautiful place but it was very uhm\n much\n heated but still\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  That's still a lot\n jump from five hundred to seven ninety is quite\n\na\n a jump\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  And it was also an apartment that was sort of almost too\n\nfancy for us in a way\n Like it was a bit of a kind of,\n Like the people in there now are professors you know\n like,\n it just didn't feel\n\n<$A>  You're a professor too\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n but\n\nnot that kind of professor you know\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  exactly was it\n\n<$B>  It was on Regent just below Sherbrooke\n That's one, west of Melrose\n\n<$A>  And what was the other like\n\n<$B>  Nice\n The streets are nice\n one\n\nblock \n\n<$A>

this notion that, one event or one person or many events and one\n\nperson had ah irreparably harmed us\n We said no, and that answer was not accepted\n we came out of forty-five\n\nminutes or perhaps it was even an hour, of interview feeling as though\n\nwe'd run a twenty-five mile marathon\n But actually quite pleased with ourselves too because, had we\n\nfelt less conviction, about our, mental and emotional and spiritual\n\nhealth, uh we wouldn't have been as forceful in resisting her ideas\n So we felt, good about that,\n\n<$A>  Well the problem with that you know uhm\n Let's hope, that

never forgive self and forgive, other people\n\nthat we're not committed to forget\n That's the one thing that took me, a long long time to\n\nunderstand\n myself anyway\n\nforgiveness is mandatory I mean even forgiving myself    you know\n\n \n\n<$B> \n\nspecially   \n\n<$A> \n\nyou know \n\n<$B>  Well if I take nothing away from this particular visit it's\n\ngoing to be, live one day at a time

friend\n\n Mendela  that beautiful, millionaire meatpacker from, Saskatoon\n\nwho was so nice to me when I was a young man, and I was talking to him\n\none day and, I asked him about plans and so forth and he'd be about my\n\nage now about seventy, and he said you know mister  Samson  we\n\ndon't worry about the future we just wake up    in the morning   praising\n\nthe fact we're still alive\n You know\n just didn't understand that emphasis of that\n\npoint\n this\n\nmight be   the last day of my life, and I try to, uhm <unclear>\n\nword </unclear>  and dry , in terms of what I've experiences that\n\n you , and try to put some of it into a spiritual system\n He simply can't understand, the lack of planning for the morrow\n\n<,,>\n He's actually unable to understand\n He said but you must have a plan\n\n\n  going to   die tomorrow\n You have some, schemes ahead\n\n\n read or think otherwise it'd be nihilism\n It isn't\n\n\npreface  you know <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\n going to   live and you have to grab onto what you've got,\n\n<$B>  Well I think I said to you yesterday too that, an ability\n\nof, his to understand is uhh, based to me on spiritual differences\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n\n and   other influences is a spiritual, philosophy, because\n\nit, asks of you to give your very best in each moment\n And that moment being the immediate one\n\n<$A>  spiritual but very\n\n<,> pragmatic too\n I mean, you have no control over yesterday\n That's gone finished\n uh\n\nimplications of what you did yesterday will live on\n\n\nhappen tomorrow,\n You really you don't have a clue\n that certain things\n\nwill materialize but you do not know\n So what are you left with\n You're left with today it's exactly what you're left with\n And, if I do a fairly decent job today, if I, am around\n\ntomorrow to experience it, it will make it easier\n I know that\n discord\n\n   to   uh face tomorrow then it's    going to   be difficult\n\n<$B>  So his concerns stemmed from, the idea that you're not,\n\nreally looking after yourself\n\n<$A>  Not planning for the future\n not concerned with the future\n I'm only concerned with, today\n\n<$B>  why he was, perturbed by\n\nthat\n\n<$A> \n He couldn't understand it that's all\n He wasn't perturbed he just couldn't understand it,\n You can not perturbe a nihilist you know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  word\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$B> \n No you can't you can't\n\n\n and he's seen too much and heard too much and ,\n You know and he's dealing with, a bunch of poor bastards at\n\nthe moment who've gone bankrupt\n You know their lives are just shattered, you see, and he's\n\ntrying to help    them   pull    themselves   together so they    don't   be violent to themselves  or mess

know, jam it out\n\n  I'll learn some jazz, you learn some blues\n\n\nwords </unclear> \n\n<$B>  anyways so\n uhm\n\n<,>    cos I had that    Oscar   Peterson book    ,  and in\n\nback I was just

 add a bit more uh, you know you ad lib more \n\n you <unclear> two words </unclear> you  know more of a more\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n of the uh\n\nkind of piano solos that were written out in classical music\n\n<$B>  What like a cadenza\n\n<$A> \n But a real cadenza\n\n<$B>  Hmm\n But ya like there's more freedom you know like classical is a bit\n\nmore rigid whereas, you know I guess with the jazz well of course  \n\nyou know jazz is, ya it's more feel \n\n<$A> \n It's for your heart and your soul all that sort of stuff\n\n<$B>  But I don't know I think for me, like I mean once you\n\nlearn a classical style    you're      kind of   set    in that  \n\n  mode,  so I think I need a teacher you know\n\n<$A> \n you put feeling\n\ninto it there  \n\n<$B>  I know but the thing is I want someone to say, okay,\n\n\n  in   a classical <unclear> two words </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> , like structure\n Like this, this is such and such a chord and like know what it\n\nsounds like and this is, a

it'd be related to others huh\n\n<$B> \n\n like     I'd like to learn is how to read from you know\n\nthose fake books where they just write the melody lines and the chords \n\n and then you improvise  from that\n\n<$A> \n Ya that's amazing\n\n<$B> \n\ncos   I'm sure there's    some \n\n sort of jazz structure there, you know\n you\n\nlearn those chords down pat\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  the

come up\n\n<$A>  Hm,\n You can't depend on people these days\n\n<$B>  No you can't,\n wouldn't even\n\ninsist on her doing it\n If it comes to her having a vacation, before bringing us to\n\nIkea, she needs a vacation more than she needs to stick around here\n\n<$A>  you\n\ndon't   say you can do something if you're not sure whether you can\n\ndo it or not\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  I know I never do

them all out by long hand, and  ,  they   went to his office, they elected some\n\nclass president or something who went to his office with a bunch of other\n\ncommittee members or something like student committee members and demanded\n\n<,> that, he type up his own notes   \n\nyou know so that they can   read them better\n very\n\ngood I mean    it's not   at all sloppy\n If you look at it it's very decipherable, you know\n But can you imagine that he's nice enough to give them photocopies\n\nof his own personal lecture notes and then they want him to type these notes\n\nup\n\n\nyou're not seriously considering doing that are you\n your time,\n know\n\n\n<$B>  did he do\n\n<$A>  think this happened last\n\nyear\n he'd think about it and I don't think he's\n\ndone anything yet because  \n\n he's not teaching   this term\n\n<$B>  Well tell them to get one of their own to type them up\n\n<$A>  Mm, well yeah that's right\n Why not\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n this from his grant

they'll be nailed to the beams on this side won't\n\nthey\n The beams will be behind it\n\n<$A>  depends,\n necessarily\n\n\nshelves  on the\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  it would be a good idea\n\nto keep the

\n\n<$B>  Cos if it went down there it would just rot\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  Well that wouldn't be too hard to do\n I mean that's fairly simple cutting compared to what we're going\n\nto do around the   stairs \n\n<$B> ,\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  mm, mm\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nconcentrate on what we have \n\n<$B> , yeah\n\n<$B>  Yeah,\n Well okay\n Well let's see now what else do I have to remember to ask for,\n deliver all this\n\nstuff aren't they\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n That's right\n\n<$A> , Yeah you should probably have them deliver it to the\n\n  garage  so that we can just take it right down\n basement\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  going to\n\n    what I was    going to   \n\n ask about cos\n\n\nsometimes\n\n<$A> \n Yeah\n\n<$B>  And I'm concerned about uh,\n this is where the other uh cement uh shed you\n\n  know, \n this is where the flooding is and\n\nit mostly stays along this side but\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Oh that's right\n Get some sealer some wood sealer\n\n<$B>  Some wood sealer,\n Yeah\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  I like my spelling better\n\n<$A>  It's more creative\n\n<$B> \n It's uh, more along the line of uhm, Esperanto isn't it\n\n<$A>  I don't know\n\n I thought Esperanto was, more based on Spanish\n\n<$B>  Oh I don't know\n\n<$A>  Neither do I\n\n<$B> ,\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\n<$A> , ask\n\n Dan  about the nail gun because he may have to get shells for it\n\n<$B>  Shells\n\n<$A>  Yeah it uses shells\n\n<$B>  Oh,\n\n<$A>  Or cartridges or whatever they're called\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  you then\n\n to see how thing works\n\n<$A>  Yeah,\n Now we had some renovations done at the office last year, as\n\nyou know\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  And uh when they put up the walls, they used a nail gun\n\n , \n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  And afterwards we found all these shell casings all over the\n\nplace, and,\n till we realized what they, had\n\ncome \n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  a few\n\nwords </unclear>  thinking \n\n<$A>  I don't know,\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  be in\n\n solid wall right\n\n<$A>  Well yeah\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A> , Cos I'm not driving those nails into the cement with a\n\nhammer\n\n<$B>  No\n\n<$A>  No\n\n<$B> \n\n without a    nail gun what would  they  do,\n\n<$A>  Hmm\n lean it up against a\n\n<$A>  Well, uhm,\n\n\nthe   base, to the uh, floor\n\n\n<$B>  certainly make it a lot

maybe they\'re using different film\n\n<$A>  by the way\n\n<$B>  Well everybody seemed to be dismayed that it was overgrown\n Uhm I presume because, you\'ve gone to it for years and seen it\n\n<,,> lovingly cared for and manicured but, I don\'t think I\'ve been there\n\nbefore so it didn\'t bother me to see it uh grown over\n But it was uhm, untidy\n But it was a lovely place and uh\n\n<$A>  I dislike it\n\n<$B>  Why is that\n\n<$A>  I\n\nwas born   less than half a mile from that rockery and, into that\n\nsort of upper-middle-class environment, surrounded by wealth, and\n\n<,,> you know

\n\n<$A>  Oh look there\'s a child, uhh I look there\'s a child and I\n\n walk there and in the seats and I walk there  a certain amount of\n\nhappiness and all that was destroyed, uhh in nineteen

never stressed the " half\n\n" part and you know that\n It just strikes me as, something that doesn\'t need to be\n\nstressed, but of course how I feel about it, is not a straightforward\n\n<,,> sort of, situation\n I\'m very grateful that we all get along\n you know mesh\n\nwith mine  \n And uh, the bottom line for me has always been how much joy they\n\nbring into your life\n So, I, would like

Uhm, I hope, that we can all come through it, with\n\naffection, and strong ties\n You know I\'m not particularly concerned about that as far as uh my\n\nsisters are concerned\n I\'m a little more concerned, about how it will affect you\n But I feel a lot better after, I guess the conversation the\n\nother morning, uhm where you stressed you are living one day at a time and\n\nyou do feel, optimistic about the future and when the time is appropriate\n\nyou\'ll consider, new adventures, but for this moment you\'re just uhm\n\ntaking it a day at a time\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Yes, I am\n\n<$A>  Why\n\n<$B>  Well, I suppose it\'s the business of vows\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  in sickness and in health\n\n part there\'s  the till death     unless   why bother being married\n And that there are many choices to how you can, be in a\n\nrelationship\n There\'s the common-law situations there\'s the more casual\n\nsituations and there\'s marriage\n And uhm the essential idea of marriage is a life-long commitment\n it\'s hard not to use\n\nmelodramatic words    like   " vows\n\n" and " honour " and uh that sort of thing but I\n\nappreciate that, it wouldn\'t do anyone any good for, you all to stay\n\ntogether if there\'s uh, essential unhappiness\n\n<$A>  Don\'t you understand her position at all\n\n<$B>  Oh sure I\'m very good at putting myself in other people\'s\n\nshoes\n Absolutely\n I guess it\'s a question of the newness\n\n     getting   used to uh the new\n\nparameters\n\n<$A>  I just\n\nremember things\n It\'s uh also a social contract\n uh\n\nyou can   break that contract\n And where society\'s set up in a certain way and uh, we have\n\nagreed we have laws which say, if that contract becomes inoperable we can\n\ndissolve the contract, according to certain rules and regulations and\n\nprocedures\n\n\n <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B>  has it changed\n\n<$A>  Well, it\'s a very simple reason, marriage was a\n\nsacrament ordained by God\n\n\nmarriage was uh,   you could not dissolve marriage  \n It was based upon, a, uh sacrament, which could not be\n\naltered\n change a\n\nsacrament\n It was an absolute\n We no longer believe that\n tell you\n\nsomething interesting\n I\'m not angry\n I beg your pardon that\'s not quite true\n the\n\n  the   act itself, okay\n Uhm I don\'t care\n family\n\nunit as we know it will no longer exist, okay,\n But I\'m not particularly surprised about it nor am I\n The only thing I worry about is my health\n I\'ll be absolutely honest\n Will my health, at seventy years of age, be okay so that I\n\ncan discharge my responsibility with the kids\n I mean you know I am a\n\npoor man, but I\'m not worried about money  \n I\'m simply not worried about it\n I\'m not trying to\n physically, and\n\npsychologically and spiritually an environment where those kids will,\n\nthrive  \n And that\'s what my responsibility is\n Nothing else\n\n<$B>  was\n\nover the other day  , uh he mentioned that his parents were having\n\ntheir fiftieth, anniversary, and I, thought how unusual that was and\n\nI think I said something to you later about well heck the only, people in\n\nour family that are    going to   get to the\n\ntwenty-five are    going to   be  Chloe \n\nand  Arnie \n And uh well perhaps I should remember I don\'t see any, trouble\n\non the horizon for  Tom  and  Sammy  as well\n But it is unusual to have that sort of, uh length of marriage\n what people\n\nare capable of too to have your marriage again melodramatic terms fail\n I mean it doesn\'t fail at all it changes, uhm but I suppose I\n\nhave, conflicting feeling about that as well\n I don\'t know if people can go, a lifetime,\n It\'s a clash of romantic notions with more practical notions\n Particularly with the stresses that uh people face, in this,\n\ntime\n\n<$A> \n\ncough  which I\'ve seen,\n I\'ve seen over and over and over again and this may be having\n\nsomething to do with times in which we live, where the one partner, for\n\nwhatever reason  outlives  the other\n who\'s a full\n\nprofessor there, and his wife put him through school for years and she was\n\na secretary and uh he got his B A and his M A and his P H D and, started\n\npublishing nationally and internationally, and he outgrew his wife\n secretary you know\n\npounding away on her word processing machine\n Suddenly couldn\'t communicate anymore,\n And I\'ve seen the same thing with women uhh,\n\n\nskilled position,\n And her husband was a carpenter,\n And he couldn\'t keep up with her anymore and she\'s wanted it out\n\nand she got out hmm\n And it\'s, not, too dissimilar to the relationship I had with\n\n Kim \n\n\n in   an expanding world, and my world is contracting,\n So you know that part I understand too\n That\'s quite apart from the physical aspects\n\n<$B>  you\'re\n\n  it seems to me that you\'re   mostly talking about intellect\n\nand, world experience\n There\'s, much more, to, healthy relationships than just\n\nthe sharing of ideas and the growing of the intellect\n\n\nthat keep us closest to someone often have little to do with those things I\n\nthink\n\n<$A>  talking about\n\nsex\n\n<$B>  Uhh yes, but more the feeling of being home when you\'re\n\nwith a particular person\n\n<$A>  See one of the things about\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> feeling of relationships is that, if you have a\n\nstrong sexual bond,    you   can\n\nautomatically resolve certain problems, through sexuality\n You reach a crisis, ah you rejoin sexually, and you start\n\nagain and that\'s the essence of, certain kinds of relationships\n It\'s a very healing thing\n It\'s a delight and it\'s a healing thing\n We don\'t have that,\n\n<$B> \n\n this is her father she\'s talking to\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n  fifteen   years is a long time to be with somebody\n\nand uhm\n Joe\n\n oh you\'ve got the seven year itch\n Uhm, which in a very small way was true, and that was more\n\nan entire crisis of identity    and uhm   a\n\nterror of the, emotional blandness that had crept into, my relationship\n\nwith him\n But, that\'s something I struggle with too I suppose the idea\n\nthat,

finding a family and the sentence that really rang\n\nfor me was he said  I've discovered that finding family ultimately\n\nmeans losing the family ,\n And it was an aspect that you hadn't thought

essentially\n\nthat is heated by laser\n dries\n\n  solid, to a plastic\n And this laser is hooked up to a computer and if you give it a\n\nthree dimensional graphic, it will cool thin layers of plastic on top of\n\neach other until it gets the three dimensional object\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n Ya it's totally cool\n And what they did was they uh, did x-rays of a, uh no I\n\nguess it'd be,    magnetic  \n\nresonance imaging    of a   mummy, cos\n\nthey wanted to look at the skull shape and stuff or some sort   of \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  I can't remember\n\n\n<$B> \n\n some     I remember   reading    about   something like   that \n\n<$A>  and then they did it\n I guess M R I\n\nof      the    skull so they didn't\n\nhave to dissect it and then they recreated a three dimensional uh replica of\n\nthe skull\n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A>  was really\n\n<,,> impressive\n\n<$B> \n\n     I didn't    \n\ncatch on about the, three dimensional plastic,   making thing\n\n\n\n<$A>  Making

no\n\n<$A>  reviewing a uh\n\n Arnold Schwarzenegger movie on The Critic kind of thing\n\n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Ya he was bad\n It was really good\n Man\n done by the same guys who did\n\nThe Simpsons\n Like not Matt Groening but, two of the other guys who produce\n\nit\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n<$A>  Ya\n\n<$B>  He doesn't do much though does he Matt Groening,\n by, bang\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n  \n\n<$B>  guess he just thought up the\n\ncharacters \n\n<$A> \n Well I think, initially he helped more but uh\n Halloween\n\nspecials I think he was listed as a producer\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  not I don't know\n\n<$B>  I don't\n\nunderstand about this showbiz stuff\n and so\n\ndirected by\n and such a blah blah blah film written by\n\nduh\n you know like\n the big boss here\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B>  a producer does\n\nwhat  ,\n\n<$A>  Director generally, creates the vision, and says this\n\nis what I want to see\n Producer, generally, actually makes it come into being\n They're both on the set\n Often the director will order actors and say uh, I want you to\n\ndo this I want to show this kind of emotion I want this set to look dark like\n\nthis I want the lighting to be like this\n The producer actually gets the lighting guy and says okay these\n\nare the kinds of levels we need set them up uhm I'll order some more lights\n\nfor you I'll get this  ,  so\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  I think the director is more visionary translates the\n\nwriter's vision and the producer tends to, help enact it\n\n<$B> \n\n  such     it's a so and so   film, so what\n\ndoes that mean\n\n\n<$A> \n He brings the doughnuts everyday\n\n I don't know\n But I think that's like uh whoever owns the company\n Like The Simpsons and so on was done by a group called Klasky\n\nCsupo\n laugh\n\n \n\n<$B>  a dog at the end\n\n<$A>  Eh\n\n<$B>  Was it the dog at the end no,\n\n<$A>  No\n Oh well the company, see it's a tough call\n The animation's done by Klasky Csupo I think the filming or\n\nsomething or the printing of the film is another company\n Klasky Csupo got big\n like The Simpsons\n\nThe Critic, they do, Rugrats    they do \n\n a whole bunch of shows\n\n<$B> \n\nare   being like, sitcoms\n\n<$A> \n Well I guess we got sick of\n watch like\n\nFresh Prince or, I don't know    almost any of\n\nthose shows   Wings is one of the few that I kind of stand but,\n\nalmost

were\n\ntalking about  , they were making reference to   that woman\n\n<,> who was recently killed by her husband, and how the legal system\n\nbasically failed to, recognize all of the signs even though she was saying\n\nthat, you know her husband had made threats against her and this sort of\n\nthing\n\n\n<$C> \n\n Centres locaux de services communautaires  , community health\n\nauthority

as well\n And what happened was uhm, you know the police basically said\n\nwell what do you expect us to do provide twenty-four hour surveillance,\n\n\n uhm \n\n<$C>  there\'s been a threat\n\n<$B>  Uhm exactly\n So anyways they were talking about making recommendations to,\n\nyou know, what would happen if everytime there\'s been a complaint like\n\nthat or a threat like that that you know   , what the police were trying to   say was that uhm\n\nyou can\'t take every threat seriously because people tend to say those things\n\nall the time\n\n<$C> \n\n a history of abuse as well\n\n<$B>  Well I don\'t know\n about\n\nthe case cos I hadn\'t heard anything\n say that much\n\n<$C>  I assumed there\'d been a history\n\nof abuse especially if they were involved with the C L S C for counselling\n\n<$B>  Ya\n of the\n\nrecommendations that    they   were making is that\n\nsocial workers should become integrated within the police force     , to    intervene and do\n with cases rather than waiting them to\n\ngo to\n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n living in London I working with    the London Distress Centre   there\n\n<,,> and    one of the   training things\n\nthat I went to there was with the police and they were talking about they\'d\n\njust started a program where social workers were working    in conjunction with \n\n the police  , was  that actually in the police force,\n\n   that when   they the police responded to a\n\ndomestic violence call, then the social worker would go as well\n\n<$B> \n Mhhm\n\n<$A>  Mhh\n\n<$C>  And that it was the social worker basically who was\n\nintervening and    the   police were the ones who\n\nwere, making sure that nothing, worse happened  ,  or\n\nnothing else happened, ensuring the safety of everybody there\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  And it sounded like it was an excellent program\n\n\nDirector of Youth Protection  where I was working this year, uhm \n\nPam Lafleur  she\'s starting that,   here with the Montreal\n\n Police force working with them especially in terms of, sexual abuse\n\nand child sexual abuse\n having social workers working with the police\n\nforce, and they\'re responding to cases like that\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  at Youth Protection\n\n  you\'d get a call  \n\n about child sexual abuse   and then they\'d often have a police\n\nperson   , going and   interviewing the\n\nchild as well, without a social worker there and   ,\n\noften   the police, weren\'t, trained at all in that kind of\n\n   thing  <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$A>  there for totally\n\ndifferent purposes\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  it ended up that they\'ve had some really\n\nbad kind of results\n Not always obviously but often some really, negative results in\n\nthe child\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> ,\n\nwill

let's say someone filed a Federal Income Tax\n\nReturn,    as   a resident of\n\nQuébec\n\n<$A>  Uh huh\n\n<$B>  And so the Federal Government, you know processes or\n\nwhatever\n But does then the Québec know\n\n\n Government does not receive a return from that person\n\n<$A>  you send both\n\nreturns   to the same address\n\n\nor   whatever it is\n Sudbury for Ontario I don't\n\nknow what it is in Québec\n\n\n \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n<$A>  You send the same form, both the Federal and the Quebec\n\none are sent to the same address\n\n<$B>  Are they\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  And you pay one cheque\n You write one cheque which includes both your Federal and\n\nProvincial taxes and then they the    Federals\n\n , transport that money to the province\n\n\n<$B>  ever filled out a Québec income\n\ntax form\n\n<$A>  No\n\n<$B>  Well, no it's a completely separate form\n\n<$A>  It's a seperate form but you put it in the same envelope\n London Ontario you send it to\n\nSudbury\n\n\nis is   there's   a section actually, in the return for the\n\ncalculation of Ontario tax\n Not only income tax but also the individual surtax\n\n\ncalculation   ,  the final calculation  \n Yeah you're right but in Québec there's two different forms\n can fill out the Federal\n\nincome tax\n\n\n,  except as a   actual credit that you get\n\nbecause    they   assume you're paying some\n\nkind of Québec   income \n\n<$B>  so you have to pay two different cheques for\n\nQuébec\n\n<$A>  Yes\n and I'm sure\n\nthe addresses are different as\n with\n\n  to which   the Federal forms are sent are uhm    sort of   <unclear> multiple words </unclear> tax something\n\nuh\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  In fact that may be the one for Québec\n\n<$B>  Oh I understand\n So okay this is a special arrangement they have with Québec\n\nbut    I'm still very sure   that    they   keep track of uh    that's \n\n one of the areas of great inter-provincial co-operation\n\n<$A>  Certainly in Ontario it would be because it's the same form\n\nyou know   as we  saw\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nsplit up the monies at some point\n\n\ncould   work quite seperately  ,  so\n\n<$B> ,\n\n<$A> \n\nhave that   <unclear> multiple words </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  point is\n\nthat as a Québec resident in a sense the Federal Government gives you\n\nmoney in order to pay your Québec taxes, because you get a \n\n credit  on your income\n return\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  uh\n\nuh falsely presenting it simply because uh,\n\n\nfilling out the form this is what it looks like, uhm especially if you're\n\nfrom Ontario because in Ontario, you get to this point at the end of the\n\nincome return where you have to pay more tax because it's the   Ontario\n\nright  Provincial Tax\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nsurtax \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Like when you're filling out the Federal return in\n\nQuébec when you get to the same part of the  form     you   get a   credit  in Québec which is\n\nbased on your uh uhm, the amount of Federal tax that you pay\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Uh huh\n\n<$A> \n\n tax  you get with Québec's\n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  But then you pay a lot more in your tax to Québec\n\n<$A>  laugh\n\n \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n\n<$A>  have to\n\nput resident of Québec where it says      in\n\nwhich   province do you do you reside as of the thirty-first of\n\nDecember nineteen ninety-four \n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n<$A>  gonna\n\n  going to   check that\n\n<$B>  But why would they care\n\n<$A> \n\n in  \n\n<$B>  Yeah I guess so\n It's interesting\n\n<$A>  In fact you know how the bible has different degrees of sin\n\n  then I would say your degree is much greater than mine \n\n<$B> \n\n words\n\n</unclear>  \n\n<$A> \n No but it's interesting because uhm I haven't paid my debt either\n\nso\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n\nreceiving a cheque from a company in Québec, you know it's pretty\n\nclear then that the trail of T 4 forms will lead back you know    to   the money you're making but uh   \n\nif the   Québec Government doesn't have any direct knowledge\n\nof the money you're making, then you know\n\n<$A>  I think I get paid in cash anyway\n\n<$B>  if the money comes directly\n\nfrom the government in the form of a grant or something\n\n<$A>  They issue a T 4 for a grant\n\n<$B>  not not not there's not accompanying there's\n\nno no there's no accompanying  , it's only a Federal

Catholic priest\n dilemma I had\n\nthe impression from some of the promos and stuff that   \n\nit was   also a question was on uh assault or    he was told something in confession   and had   \n\nto\n\n<$A>  there's two\n\n  parallels issues\n which\n\nis disclosed to him uh in the confessional booth\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And his personal, crisis is whether to uphold the\n\ntraditions and the rules of the Church    and not \n\n uhm    not uhm reveal   what was\n\ndisclosed to him or to stop the suffering of this girl who    wouldn't   give him permission to tell \n\n  her   mother\n\n<$B>  Wait who confessed the girl\n\n<$A>  The girl confessed but she didn't want him to tell anyone,\n\nand do anything about it and so uh\n\n<$B>  Why did she confess\n\n\n<$A>  Yeah I know but I mean she had to talk to someone she just it\n\nwas    after she'd   finished confessing \n\n  and uhm   she just hadn't told anyone in her\n\nlife so\n So I mean he is struggling with his dilemma which was uh basically\n\nthe whole idea whether  ,  we should\n\nrecognize   uhm    the   problems in\n\ninstitutional constraint and be flexible enough to allow for uh changes in\n\nthe rules    when   we need or whether tradition\n\nand authority should always uh win over\n And that's the same thing with him\n I mean should he uh be allowed to experiment with his sexuality in\n\norder to be a better priest in order to know himself better or uhm does he\n\nhave to totally repress everything   so \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n   he's   charged with uh conducting in an act and\n\nuh he's like ostracized from the whole parish and everyone you know what I\n\nmean\n\n\n colleague priest is really great\n\n\n  the   priest the first priest to come back and do\n\nmass together with him and uhm, in that way he'd be showing that his sin\n\nis no greater than    uh the   sins of the average\n\nperson\n in the congregation\n\n  in the parish   uh totally ostracizes him except for that\n\none young girl    who   wrote to him her incest\n\n\n that's just showing   that they each are supporting each other\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nnot   not   stopping her suffering\n\n\nhe should   have stopped the suffering but, he didn't and so I\n\nthink that turned out with that\n\n\n  her   forgiveness all the more Christian and all\n\nthe more uhm, uh laudable\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  But the mother did and maybe she did herself\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  And her mother did\n\n<$A>  Her mother did\n Her mother blamed it on the priest at the end\n This is your fault that we didn't know\n If you had told us we would have stopped this and I hope you rot\n\nin Hell\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Pretty serious stuff\n\n<$A>  Ya\n But it was an interesting study by incest uhm victims and\n\nperpetrators\n is\n\n uhm  is   traditional is what you would expect, the\n\nattitude to be if that person were to be\n Which is totally, unapologetic, totally unapologetic\n He would actually talk to the priest about it and say I'm just\n\ndoing what every man every husband every father wants to do and that  \n\nit's uh \n\n<$B>  in the film\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n     the   guy says\n\n<$A>  The ather, defends his acts, vehemently and says stay\n\nout of my business\n was uh\n\n<,>    which     is   often\n\nthe attitude of  perpetrators  or if they would feel guilty you know\n But apparently not\n But at least in his opinion they were quite uhm, uhm willing to\n\naccept and condone their own activities,\n\n<$B>  So then why would he have any special knowledge\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  That'd be like a police\n\ndetective   or <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  He's Catholic\n\n<$A>  arrived at the\n\nchurch\n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$A>  Truly he doesn't know anything about incest\n\nbut, it just is uh\n\n<$B> \n\n <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Hey man that's that whole concept of liberalism\n\n<$A>  speak\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\npeople    who won't   defend themselves like\n\n  <unclear> words </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\ngoing to   stand up and go hey that's not true\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nread I don't know how true this is but ah uhm, I heard a kind of anecdotal\n\nstory about Eighteenth Century Jesuits, in training in Rome\n#> And uhm   , ah I guess I think there's a\n\nperiod called an initiate and   before you actually    become ordained as a priest   you're still I guess uh\n\nin a sense a Jesuit but an initiate\n the\n\nthis   A kind of a prof   or whatever who told his students\n\nyou know uh like sometime before the ordination was due to take place the\n\nstudents had you know been fairly successful in their courses\n prof advised them to go out and\n\nyou know buy a hooker in the    back streets  \n\nof Rome so that they would know something about, human sexuality if they\n\ndidn't already because it would help in their uhm,\n And they should deal with that part of their character whatever\n\nkind of, you know sexuality they had because it would make them a better\n\npriest, in the end\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  they actually became priests\n\n<$A>  becoming\n\n    Becoming   a priest    no one   asks you uh if you've ever gotten laid  \n\nbefore \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  they ask you\n\n  to take a vow of celibacy\n\n<$B>  Hmm hmmm\n\n<$A>  And uhm\n\n<$B>  Which unless you're married it was a sin anyway to get a,\n\n  <unclear> multiple words </unclear> \n\n<$A>  lesser\n\n  one really, a much lesser one\n\n<$B>  Than breaking the vows of celibacy\n\n<$A>  Well yeah I think so ya\n\n\nread   read     some types of documents from early\n\nmodern Europe you get the impression that priests were always uh you know\n name\n\n</unclear> council uhm uhm there seems to have been this concern that priests\n\neverywhere were co-habiting with women and stuff like this\n Church\n\nauthorities the Catholic Church authorities   Roman Catholic\n\nauthorities      kept \n\n prohibiting this kind of stuff\n\n<$B>  Uh huh\n\n<$A>  So the fact that they were prohibiting this stuff suggests\n\nthat, they thought it was occurring\n\n<$B>  Uh huh\n\n<$A>  I guess how\n\nuhm    sort of   bad priests were    by the   the

think\n Well no I'm not going to dismiss myself that way\n\n<$A>  No exactly\n\n<$B> \n\n the   odd, ball in the family because I'm an artist or because\n\nI've chosen to do, this kind of work\n\n\n doing what they do    and      I mean there's no difference   to me\n\nin terms of, you know    you're   each,\n\ndoing what you do in your life\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B> \n\nmet, people who, you know can barely function,   and \n\n<$A>  what appears to be normal, stuff\n\n<$B>  if you want\n\nto start making, comparisons between strange people or people  \n\nwho     can't   get dressed in the\n\n\n   you're incredibly   normal \n\n  in     , every   \n\n sense  of the word\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> , it's funny eh\n\n<$B>  be considered\n\nstrange or\n\n\n\n I'm not considered\n I don't know if people consider me strange\n They would never say that to my face\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> ,\n\n and I don't\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Not in my\n\nimmediate family  \n\n\nsort of have that but they also know that I'm,   \n\nall these   other things too\n larger family the people\n\nwho don't see me except maybe at   Thanksgiving, or whatever \n\n<$A> , sure\n\n<$B>  in\n\ntheir eyes  this kind of, weird one\n\n<$A> \n Mm\n\n<$B> \n\n nothing weird about me,   right \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Like what is weird\n just been\n\nthinking about this\n\n<$A> \n\n It's a very   strange uh\n after\n\n    that whole thing with Michael Jackson,   okay\n\n\n\n<$B>  mm\n\n<$A>  Next day I'm sitting on the bus\n There are these two women,\n One probably in her early forties\n One in her early fifties,\n well I mean, just\n\nbecause they, got up on that show and tried to pretend they're normal I\n\nmean they're not normal, they're not normal\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  I\n\ncouldn't   believe it\n They're sitting there trying to tell us how normal they are\n They're just not normal and that's not a normal marriage\n I don't I'm sorry that's not a normal marriage\n, just prior to that I\n\nhad heard the beginning of their conversation or the end of the other\n\nconversation which was all about the Paul Bernardo, trial\n\n<$B>  laugh\n\n a normal marriage\n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And anyway then they started talking all about Michael\n\nJackson    and   you know I'm sorry but that\n\nmake-up and everything\n I mean this person he's not normal he's not normal\n And, at first I'm just kind of like discretely listening\n Trying to look out the window\n But eventually I found them so fascinating, that I turn and I\n\njust looked at them blatantly\n\n\n<$B> , ya\n\n<$A>  it, and I'm going, and this is\n\nnormal\n\n<$B> \n to know why they\n\nthink that way\n It's great eavesdropping\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Ya ya\n\n<$A> \n\n well, these are the kind of people who will sit there    and   you know just decide all sorts of things about whether\n\nso and so is normal or not normal or whatever\n just sitting there\n\ngoing is it really so normal\n Like, if they were me looking at them what would they see\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  And would they, think that that's so normal\n To be so completely involved in the lives of all these celebrity\n\nstories and celebrity, trials   and \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And then on the other hand I had to go well I guess it is\n\npretty normal because lots of people do it    \n\n<$B> \n, I do it\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  eat it up you know\n up\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  one part\n\n  , of   my life\n\n<$A>  so\n\nconfusing\n weird normal\n the\n\n  whole thing about\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  that whole\n\nthing about mundane\n\n\n , or   fascination with, strangeness and I was\n\nlike ahhh  it's so weird\n\n<$B>  Very weird\n\n<$A>  Ya\n\n<$B>  Well normal is a construction so I mean no one fits in\n It's not possible\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  doesn't exist\n I mean if you're going to look at the institutions, that we've\n\nestablished as being normal  ,  the family and I mean\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> , I think\n\nit's called A Sweet Life\n\n<$B>  No\n\n<$A>  It's uhm, what's his name Michael Mike,\n Uh shoot, somebody from England\n I think he, uh,\n I'm trying to think of other movies that he did\n He may have done like, My Beautiful Laundrette\n\n<$B>  or he wrote\n\n  it or directed it \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Uh Stephen Frears\n\n<$A>  Uh oh no\n\n<$B>  Oh I know who you're thinking of\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  can't ever remember this guy's

has\n\nthis eating disorder    but  \n\nlike everybody looks strange\n\n<$B>  Mm\n\n<$A> \n\n,\n I mean just strange just like, affectionately weirdly strange\n\n<,> and familiar\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n And I'm sitting there going boy he really captured something here\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  really captured something about how every\n\nfamily is strange\n Every family, in some way or another\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  And with all their little quirks and you know\n they cover\n\ntheir teapots with or like just all the littlest things that make  \n\n<,,>  every\n way\n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>

  at this  point in time because it's familiar\n\n<$A> \n Yes\n\n<$B>  And I react to uh new situations, more\n\n\n<$A>  a lot recently\n\nabout    like where does   a sense of\n\nrejuvenation come   from  in what you're doing\n you know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  if something that, you've been\n\ndoing for a while\n you know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Because I mean if you talk about this project

where do you take it at a certain point\n can really relate to\n\nthat\n\n<$A> \n Oh ya\n\n<$B> \n\n<,,>  maybe at different times in different ways but\n\n<$A> \n But that's a good question actually\n To just even think of it as like, you know like the idea of a\n\nresidence or something\n Something that is not, I mean it's not all-consuming\n\n\n there's new imput of some\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n Ya ya\n get\n\n  some clarity if it's possible\n\n\nI'm    going to   see when I'm away if I'm,\n\n   kind of   able to think about that stuff\n\n<$A> \n Yup\n\n<$B>  very\n\n<,> well you

those two things\n I mean I could have made, the other decision\n\n<$A>  Uh huh\n\n<$B>  I could have\n It wasn't out of the question but,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n  but     I took it thinking okay well this is it\n a chapter\n\n\n   this thing one more time, then I will have taught here for\n\nfour   years and , given it what I felt, I could\n\n<$A> \n Mhhm\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  ya\n\n<$A>  learned more in four years\n\nthan you would have in two\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  what I mean like\n\n<$B> \n Mhhm\n\n<$A>  Because\n\n<$B>  Ya ya\n Sort of the long haul\n\n\ngood to sort of go over these things again each year and develop, stuff\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  I was real\n\ncurious about that\n\n\ntry that out\n\n<$A> , I could see that\n\n<$B>  So uhm, ya\n Anyway\n\n<$A>  Well I could see that\n\n\nthe   the   project is never not there,\n\n<$B>  Mhhm\n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n    sometimes   for myself, the\n\nissue just becomes I'm just worried that when I do have the time that,\n\nit's not    going to     happen  or\n\nit's not    going to  \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  so, you know I mean\n\n<,,>\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  I mean maybe that is a sort of an interesting year to, I\n\ndon't know lay some

  cos the    one that we\'re\n\nin here doesn\'t have too many job opportunities right now\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  no\n\n<$B>  So they got these uh good role models and then in the\n\nafternoon we had uh, six people\n Four women and two men, who are on a panel and they talked about\n Well actually what we did we took, quotations from ah a book\n\ncalled Members of the Club, question mark\n mostly\n\nabout women      who are   well\n\njust commenting on business\n And it was extremely neat because the issues are very controversial\n I mean how do women make it in business these days\n, act\n\nlike men\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  what are the problems\n always refer to the glass\n\nceiling  ,  and this book proposes another idea\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  That it has more to do with the comfort zone as they call it\n have a\n\ntendency to feel uncomfortable around women in business, ehm that\'s\n\ndifficult for them to work with\n that they want to deny\n\nthem opportunities   although  that might be the case in some\n\ninstances, it\'s more that they\'re just not comfortable\n\n<$A> \n Ya\n\n<$B>  And because they\'re not comfortable women don\'t, have an\n\nopportunity to negotiate and,

women have this, difficulty\n They debated issues of family and how women deal with all of that\n\nstuff\n\n\nwhe    whether   you delay having your family or you have\n\nit now and deal with it and

four years old, going to\n\nthe, train station in our pink and grey Ford\n There were four kids and my mother\n We would drive to the train station to pick dad up\n He had been gone for two weeks, usually and he had this huge\n\nmetal lunch can,\n And uh we would wait and wait at the train station for him to come\n\nin\n\n\nout of the  , out of the   car to, check if the train\n\nwas coming down the track\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  The rest of us had to stay in the car because we wanted to\n\nremain dignified    \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And uh because I had, one younger brother and then two\n\nolder siblings\n And uhm, I can remember him running back and telling us that\n\nthe train was coming and then you would start to hear the whistle, and\n\nthen you would start to see the smoke\n you know when\n\nyou're a little   child    and there's this huge machine\n\ncoming in\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  It was just uhm, overpowering,\n\n\n<$B>  fascinated with trains too cos they\n\nwere in my life every

away\n\n<$A>  Ya\n\n<$B>  Ya they had to make some big adjustments when the husbands\n\nfinally came home to stay you know   for one  reason or another\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  retired or\n\nwhatever ya\n\n<$A>  they\n\nused to spray alongside the tracks in order for the bushes to die down and\n\nhow it was, poison spray\n And now when he thinks back that herbicide\n And of course the spray if the wind was blowing right would blow\n\nback in your   face and \n\n<$B>  jee\n\n<$A>  Sometimes he would bring us home blueberries that the train\n\nhad to stop and it just so happened it stopped in a place where there were\n\n , blueberries  or whatever\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  He would pick us some bring them home\n\n<$B>  one of\n\nmy best friends her dad worked on the railroad and he used to go to the\n\nStates all the time  ,  so he's always brought them back stuff\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  You know things you couldn't get here\n\n<$A>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$B>  or you know things that were cheaper there or\n\nwhatever\n\n<$A>  Mhh hmm\n workers\n\n  co-workers  , uhm with the train\n Like one guy was always asking the other guys for food\n He'd want a little piece of whatever they were eating\n So one time, the guys decided they'd really get him and they\n\n<,> melted some Ex-Lax onto a donut so it looked like chocolate sauce and\n\nthey said sure\n And he took some\n\n\n \n\n<$B>  did he ever\n\nuh   see any accidents with the train\n pick\n\nup my friend's dad \n\n<$A>  there was a bridge that, went down\n\nonce and we have pictures still, of the train that went into the water\n It

\n\n building and,   my sisters  have been through it when they\n\nwent over and met the cousins and stuff\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  And that was kind of nice\n came it\n\nwas uh like learning a little bit about, your background and    that was   really neat\n Which I've never had the opportunity to do\n Uhm, as a kid we spoke French only, until, I started\n\nschool  , and  then    when you  \n\nwent into the    English   schools and the\n\nkids would laugh at    you   so, you wouldn't\n\nspeak French\n, you know\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Ya\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n\ncon    keep   it up at school\n\n<$A> \n Right\n\n<$B>  And so, with my father having passed away my mom was,\n\non her own raising us so that made it a bit   difficult

ya\n\n\n<$A> \n\n of them   one of the books   that I came across was,\n\nreally good\n little section on visiting\n\nthe doctor\n open\n\nyour mouth do your bowels move freely \n useful\n\n ,

mom said okay well, you know want me to meet you\n\nat the hospital cos I have to go to work right now but I can meet you at the\n\nhospital\n And the girl said no no no\n And so the, host-mother took it at face value\n The girl, said she could take care of herself\n Fine,\n What this girl was expecting was her host-mother to insist upon\n\ncoming      and    spending\n\ntwenty-four hours twenty-five hours a day with\n you know taking care of\n\nher every whim\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  that wasn\'t happening\n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A> \n\n host-mother, was a, self-made independent

I said\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  no idea\n\nwhat I\'d asked them\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  They just said yes or no depending on how the moment struck\n\n  them I suppose  \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  to\n\nbe a little careful   there \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Uh, because uh, I noticed that quite often uh uh\n And so pretty soon you get to realize it\'s the hesitant way they\n\nsay the word " yes " or " no ", uh that\n\ntells you, they haven\'t a clue what you\'re asking them\n\n<$A>  it depends with which\n\nones\n Like a couple of the Indians spoke better English than any of the\n\nanglophone Canadians   in the group\n\n\n

hmm\n\n<$A>  And uh, put it together in a kind of a collage\n\n\n,  uhm, doing,   a kind of an    in a way an   imitation of her work\n\n<$B>  Mm\n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n<$A> \n\nspeakers are eating as they speak for the whole conversation \n\n<$B>  No I think it\'s okay\n\n<$B>  Uhm, yeah in terms of the fish aquarium actually, uhm\n\n<$A>  Did you turn it on\n\n<$B>  Yes it\'s on\n\n<$A>  Oh,\n\n<$B> , Uhm, let me think\n I put it in in November\n in November, and\n\nI cleaned it for the first time in April\n\n<$A>  No\n\n<$B>  Ya\n it out\n\nrinsed off    the uh   gravel,  ,  and then   replenished the water\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  uhm, we\n\ndidn\'t    want to   have the background noise,\n\nuhm and uh\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  So it\'s off and the light\'s off as well\n pretty maintenance-free\n\nreally when you consider\n don\'t expect to have to\n\nclean this as often cos, I only have one fish in there now\n And when I had the two,\n\n<$A>  Did one die\n\n<$B> , Yes one passed away\n passed away\n It was a very sad event in my life\n\n<$B>  Ah\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n, just    here\'s    A  fork \n\n uh \n\n<$A>  found one\n\n<$B>  Okay\n\n<$A> \n They gave me one they didn\'t tell me\n\n<$B>  she just\n\n  she probably      uh wasn\'t  \n\nwell when I got her\n Cos I was always having to take her out of there and put her in\n\nsick bay\n I had a little bowl at the side and I\'d take some water and scoop\n\nit in and, put her in and, she\'d seem to get better and I\'d put her\n\nback in the aquarium and she\'d get sick again\n\n\nbowl   in the ah aquarium   so\n\n<$A> \n\ntake on   little personalities  , because , I had\n\nsome fish I don\'t think they were goldfish they were orange I forget   , uh what they   were called\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  They were tropical\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A> \n\nthere was one little guy\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  around that tank\n really really tiny\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A> \n not " grew"\n\n   fond of that, silly little fish\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A>  And he passed away like it was, awwww\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  a little devastated when the little\n\none went cos    because I had kept   nursing\n\nher\n You know it was harder, I mean if I\'d just come in and found\n\nher dead I think it would have been easier   to deal with  but\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> , she\n\nstill  passed on\n\n<$B>  yeah yeah yeah\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  cos\n\nI   when I   was cleaning the aquarium I had to put him in the\n\nlittle bowl, and he was very upset, with the fact that he was in this\n\nlittle bowl\n And he must be quite uhm, uh er sensitive to noise, because\n\nwhenever I would, walk in or if, there was a flash of light, he\n\nwould zip around the bowl, about five or six times frantically\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  never see him do that\n\nin there\n So I guess uh, he was showing his displeasure at the fact that\n\nhe was in this uh, little bowl\n don\'t have water\n\nhere so it\'s very awkward in terms of like you know notice if    there\'s   been a lot of water that has been depleted from\n\nthe aquarium just through, ordinary uhm evaporation\n\n<$A>  that\'s good cos you\'re\n\ngetting   natural evaporation of the water\n\n<$B>  good for me yes and\n\nuhm\n\n\nsigh , awkward to find time <unclear> two or three words </unclear>\n\n this  sounds funny it only takes a    couple of\n\n  minutes to go and get some water and yet you\'re always so busy \n\n  in your   day that, I mean how many times\n\ndo you go to, fill up water    for   the\n\nkettle  or  for the, coffee whatever, and yet, can\'t find\n\nenough time to find, water for the    poor little  fish \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  you know,\n\ngets neglected\n\n<$B>  Mm\n My spider plant, is going to be in, dire straits if I don\'t\n\nwater him tonight\n\n<$B>  And soak him\n\n<$A>  noticed\n\nthe, trunk of that tree\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  that done on purpose\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  It is\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n\n<$A>  buy it like that\n\n<$B>  Hall\n\n building , from  <unclear> French name </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  could be \'buy\' - speaker is eating\n\n all our plants there,\n And um, they\'re all doing well\n French name\n\n</unclear>  is the bonsai which is now dead\n\n, It was a gift from her\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  When I left the office upstairs cos I helped her\n, So she sent me a bonsai\n, And I told her at the time I said, I feel so guilty owning\n\na bonsai cos I know it\'s going to die\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  very well for a long time\n\n<$A>  But why would you say that\n\n<$B>  Mm, they need a lot of attention\n Yeah I gave one to my mother\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  So your parents were married in thirty-nine,\n\n<$B>  I, think so\n I don\'t know\n It\'s funny with a lot of these things you take them for granted\n\nand you don\'t  , actually, remember them \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  was an adult before I figured\n\nout that my father was forty-three when I was born\n\n<$A>  Ya, ya\n\n<$C>  young, ya\n\n<$A>  Well when you\'re the youngest\n was born\n\n<$C>  That\'s true\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  was\n\ntwenty-eight when I was born  ,  but  Julianne  is uh\n\nnine years younger \n\n<$A>', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source':

tests and that's it  \n\n<$B> <#35:1:B> Fifty percent mid-term\n<#36:1:B> Fifty percent \n<#37:1:B>      I    like that \n\nyou know \n\n<$A> <#38:1:A>   That's not too bad   \n\n<$B> <#39:1:B>   I don't mind \n\n<$A> <#40:1:A>  You just do the reading  \n<#41:1:A> You go to the classes\n<#42:1:A> You   learn the material \n\n<$B> <#43:1:B>  It's easier  ,\n\n<$A> <#44:1:A>   Ya \n\n<$B> <#45:1:B>  I mean   even though everybody at the  Bissel\n\n Centre's    going to   hear me say this \n\n, but uh \n\n<$A> <#46:1:A>  Ya ya  \n<#47:1:A> No I agree because sometimes you get so overloaded with projects\n<#48:1:A> Ya   and,  if you've\n\n<$B> <#49:1:B>     it's   just  \n\n<$A> <#50:1:A> Like right now I've got all of these group projects and it's\n\nso hard to get people together and you don't know the people that well and\n\nyou get thrown into these groups and you're just running all around like a\n\n  mad person \n\n<$B> <#51:1:B>   That's right   \n<#52:1:B> Sometimes you wonder what you're learning\n\n<$A> <#53:1:A> Ya   exactly \n\n<$B> <#54:1:B>  You know   are you really learning more  \n\nif you , do all those, things\n<#55:1:B>  ,     then   not\n\n<$A> <#56:1:A>  Right  \n\n<$A> <#57:1:A>  Mhh hmm  \n\n<$A> <#58:1:A>   Ya \n\n<$B> <#59:1:B>  So   sometimes    I really think   it's true\n<#60:1:B>   It's too  much\n\n<$A> <#61:1:A>  Right  \n\n<$B> <#62:1:B> It's almost like busy-work\n\n<$A> <#63:1:A> Well that's it\n<#64:1:A> That's it\n\n<$B> <#65:1:B> You know and once it becomes\n<#66:1:B> There's a fine line   between  busy-work and\n<#67:1:B>   learning \n\n<$A> <#68:1:A>  Ya  \n\n<$A> <#69:1:A>  And crazy   - work\n\n<$B> <#70:1:B> Ya   right\n<#71:1:B> And learning something \n\n<$A> <#72:1:A>  You know when you're just going nuts  \n<#73:1:A> Ya\n\n<$B> <#74:1:B> And there's a real reason for it\n<#75:1:B>   Anyways so I like that \n\n<$A> <#76:1:A>  Ya ya, good  \n\n<$B> <#77:1:B> And the other course I'm taking   is an Adult \n\n<$A> <#78:1:A>  Which one's   that   \n\nagain  \n\n<$B> <#79:1:B>      Adult   Ed \n\n<$A> <#80:1:A>  Adult Ed  \n<#81:1:A> Mhh\n\n<$B> <#82:1:B> We have a paper for that one\n\n<$A> <#83:1:A> Okay\n\n<$B> <#84:1:B> So I\n<#85:1:B> But not, due, yet\n\n<$A> <#86:1:A>   Ahh \n\n<$B> <#87:1:B>  And a   presentation\n\n<$A> <#88:1:A> Oh ya\n\n<$B> <#89:1:B> So we can do it in a group\n<#90:1:B> We're doing it in a group of   three \n\n<$A> <#91:1:A>  A   group presentation\n<#92:1:A>   Okay \n\n<$B> <#93:1:B>   , for me I  \n\nprefer it  ,  because there just seems\n<#94:1:B>   to \n\n<$A> <#95:1:A>  Mhh hmm  \n\n<$A> <#96:1:A>  Ya  \n\n<$A> <#97:1:A>   Well I found that group presentations aren't too\n\n, bad\n<#98:1:A>  , if you don't have to do a  write-up, to go\n\nwith it\n\n<$B> <#99:1:B>  <unclear> word </unclear> I've never done a presentation\n\n \n\n<$B> <#100:1:B>  I've never done a presentation  \n\n<$A> <#101:1:A> Cos if you do a write-up      it's\n\n  really hard  you\n<#102:1:A>   know,  to like get everybody to do an equal\n\namount\n<#103:1:A>   of work \n\n<$B> <#104:1:B>  Then's it's a <unclear> word </unclear>  \n\n<$B> <#105:1:B>  Right  \n\n<$B> <#106:1:B>  That's true  \n\n<$A> <#107:1:A> And then you know you have to, you know group edit it\n\n<$B> <#108:1:B>   You're right \n\n<$A> <#109:1:A>  You have to        make\n\nall    these meetings and ya\n\n<$B> <#110:1:B>  No  absolutely   \n\n<$A> <#111:1:A>   So that's not too bad \n\n<$B> <#112:1:B>  But I've never done a presentation  \n<#113:1:B> Would you believe it\n\n<$A> <#114:1:A> Oh come on\n<#115:1:A> Really\n<#116:1:A> You do them   , well the other  \n\nday    when you're  teaching \n\n<$B> <#117:1:B>  Ya I know  \n<#118:1:B> No that's   right \n\n<$A> <#119:1:A>  But  \n\n<$B> <#120:1:B> I know   that's why they send you to \n\n<$A> <#121:1:A>  But not formally  \n\n<$B> <#122:1:B> But not really\n<#123:1:B> I'm not sure how to you know, go about   doing it \n\nor what I'm\n<#124:1:B>   supposed  to do\n\n<$A> <#125:1:A>  Do it  \n\n<$A> <#126:1:A>  Ya  \n\n<$B> <#127:1:B> You know they just   say , do a presentation\n\nand\n<#128:1:B>   and never say on what \n\n<$A> <#129:1:A>  Ya  \n\n<$A> <#130:1:A>  Ya I'm sure you'll do fine  \n\n<$A> <#131:1:A>   Because <unclear> three words </unclear> with\n\nteaching experience \n\n<$B> <#132:1:B>  <unclear> words </unclear> what I'll  find  \n\n\n<#133:1:B> I'm not worried about doing it  , it's  just what I\n\nshould, do it on you know\n\n<$A> <#134:1:A>  No  \n<#135:1:A> No I   know \n\n<$B> <#136:1:B>  On   what\n\n<$A> <#137:1:A> But the people with teaching experience are more natural,\n\nwhen they do it\n<#138:1:A> Because people who, don't have this   experience \n\nof getting up and speaking in front of\n<#139:1:A>   people  what they do is they read their\n\npresentation\n\n<$B> <#140:1:B>  Yes  \n\n<$B> <#141:1:B>  I know  \n\n<$B> <#142:1:B> Oh really\n\n<$A> <#143:1:A> They have it on little cards and they   read it \n\n<$B> <#144:1:B>  Ahh  \n\n<$A> <#145:1:A> And    it's   not that good\n<#146:1:A> Uhm well not only for your mark but also it doesn't flow and \n\n  it's   hard to listen to as a listener in the\n\naudience\n<#147:1:A> You know if it's being read   to you \n\n<$B> <#148:1:B>  Mhh hmm  \n<#149:1:B> Mhh\n\n<$A> <#150:1:A> Or even if it's   memorized,  too\n<#151:1:A>   much or \n\n<$B> <#152:1:B>  Right  \n\n<$B> <#153:1:B>  Oh boy   it's hard to memorize a  \n\npresentation that's a  half an hour\n<#154:1:B>   long \n\n<$A> <#155:1:A>  You know    it's   hard to\n\nfollow  \n\n<$A> <#156:1:A>  Well   exactly, exactly\n\n<$B> <#157:1:B> So but mind you you\n<#158:1:B> Well I suppose you're right\n\n<$A> <#159:1:A> I think you have to memorize like certain parts but, \n\n not word for word \n\n<$B> <#160:1:B>  Because when you're teaching    it's not   the    same because    I   don't you know\n<#161:1:B>  ,  it's much more natural\n\n<$A> <#162:1:A>  No  \n\n<$A> <#163:1:A>  Mhh  \n\n<$A> <#164:1:A>   Well that's it \n\n<$B> <#165:1:B>  But anyway     ,\n\n that's   what I have to do\n\n<$A> <#166:1:A>  Ya  \n\n<$B> <#167:1:B> So  <-I've it's     really\n\n    I haven't   been bogged down with projects and,\n\nthings yet\n<#168:1:B> And  ,  I'm quite happy\n\n<$A> <#169:1:A>  Ya  \n\n<$B> <#170:1:B> I'll tell you the   truth \n\n<$A> <#171:1:A>  Good  \n\n<$B> <#172:1:B> We've been going to the country every weekend\n\n<$A> <#173:1:A>   Ohh wonderful \n\n<$B> <#174:1:B>  The leaves  , are   beautiful \n\n<$A> <#175:1:A>  Oh I   bet\n\n<$B> <#176:1:B> So I feel like I have a life\n\n<$A> <#177:1:A>   Ohh great \n\n<$B> <#178:1:B>       <unclear> words\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$A> <#179:1:A>  Ya that's   what I'm looking forward to after\n\nthis year, is getting a   life back again  \n\n<$B> <#180:1:B>  You'll be finished after this year  \n\n<$A> <#181:1:A> Well I should be finished in April,\n<#182:1:A>   If everything goes well \n\n<$B> <#183:1:B>  Ohh  \n\n<$A> <#184:1:A> Because I've got my two practicums, and then uhm  \n\nI've just got two other courses \n\n<$B> <#185:1:B>  You <unclear> words </unclear> after Christmas  \n\n<$A> <#186:1:A> No I'm doing one now\n\n<$B> <#187:1:B> Are you\n<#188:1:B>   Now \n\n<$A> <#189:1:A>  Ya  \n\n<$B> <#190:1:B> Are you in a process of doing   it  now\n\n<$A> <#191:1:A>  Ya  \n<#192:1:A> Ya ya,   ya \n\n<$B> <#193:1:B>  You're   actually doing it\n\n<$A> <#194:1:A> Well no no\n<#195:1:A> Uh well actually I'm teaching the Tyndale students now\n<#196:1:A> Beginners' class\n<#197:1:A> And this is to prepare us for going into the primary school\n<#198:1:A> For teaching beginners\n<#199:1:A> Like children huh\n\n<$B> <#200:1:B> Okay\n\n<$A> <#201:1:A> But we get the adults now because   they're  so\n\nmuch easier to teach than little kids\n\n<$B> <#202:1:B>  Ya  \n<#203:1:B> Ya\n\n<$A> <#204:1:A> And uhm so we're practising with them\n<#205:1:A> And uh   I'm \n\n<$B> <#206:1:B>  How are   you feeling\n<#207:1:B> How are you finding,\n\n<$A> <#208:1:A> Well it's interesting\n<#209:1:A> Again we're doing group teaching\n<#210:1:A> So this has been kind of   difficult \n\n<$B> <#211:1:B>  Okay   group teaching meaning you do some and\n\nthen they do some or    together   you do\n\nit\n<#212:1:B> You can't teach together\n\n<$A> <#213:1:A> We do a little bit\n<#214:1:A> Uhm you know    there   is like\n\none person in charge of each part more or less\n\n<$B> <#215:1:B>   Ya \n\n<$A> <#216:1:A>  But then   uh we get like the other people in our\n\ngroups, uh to interact with the   students,  in like the\n\ngroup work or the pair work and that's what it\n<#217:1:A>   <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B> <#218:1:B>  Mhh hmm  \n\n<$B> <#219:1:B>  Right   but generally how you do it usually is\n\none gives a presentation perhaps and one might do\n\n<$B> <#220:1:B> No\n<#221:1:B>   You <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$A> <#222:1:A>  Uhhm  \n\n<$B> <#223:1:B> You can't both give   the presentation \n\n<$A> <#224:1:A>  Well for example    ,    you   introduce \n<#225:1:A>   something  and then maybe I'll get    like one of the\n\nstudent teachers   to come and do the dialogue\n<#226:1:A>   with me for example \n\n<$B> <#227:1:B>  The introduction  to the  lesson no  \n\n<$B> <#228:1:B>  Right  \n\n<$B> <#229:1:B>  Okay okay right  \n\n<$A> <#230:1:A> And then maybe I'll take half the class   and \n\nyou know get them to follow me and then the other class will follow the other\n\nperson\n<#231:1:A>   for example \n\n<$B> <#232:1:B>  Right  \n\n<$B> <#233:1:B>  It has its good   points and its bad points I\n\nguess\n\n<$B> <#234:1:B>   You think \n\n<$A> <#235:1:A>  Well ya  \n<#236:1:A> The thing is we got put into groups with people that we hardly\n\nknew\n\n<$B> <#237:1:B> Okay\n\n<$A> <#238:1:A> So that it takes a little while till you get used to the\n\nother, person's personality    and   what we\n\nfound was we were haggling over a bunch of  ,  insignificant\n<#239:1:A>   details \n\n<$B> <#240:1:B>  Right  \n\n<$B> <#241:1:B>  Right   right\n\n<$A> <#242:1:A> You know trying to decide you know the exact word that you\n\nwant to put in you know at every little model sentence that you're going to\n\ngive\n<#243:1:A>    and   you know    it\n\n  can take like ten twenty minutes sometimes\n<#244:1:A> One person wants to say it this way and the other person want to\n\nsay it this way\n<#245:1:A> Like somebody wants to say  how are you  and\n\nsomebody else wants to say  how are you doing \n<#246:1:A> And then this gets argued about for   you know fifteen or\n\ntwenty minutes \n\n<$B> <#247:1:B>  Right\n<#248:1:B>    and you think a it's   waste \n\n of   time \n\n<$A> <#249:1:A>  It's     ridiculous  you know\n\n<$B> <#250:1:B>  Ya  \n<#251:1:B> That is\n\n<$A> <#252:1:A> It is\n<#253:1:A> So these are the kinds   of things that \n\n<$B> <#254:1:B>  How often do you   have to go\n\n<$A> <#255:1:A> Uhm well I've done uh two, sessions\n<#256:1:A> And I've got two more to do\n<#257:1:A> So I'm in a group of four people and we have to divide up\n\neighty-five minutes between the four of us\n<#258:1:A> And we also have to follow this kind of pattern they have\n<#259:1:A> Probably you've heard about this\n<#260:1:A> The pre-activities the while-activities and the post-activities\n\n<$B> <#261:1:B> Ya\n\n<$A> <#262:1:A> And then we've hardly had any time like to meet   and\n\n organize this\n<#263:1:A>   stuff \n\n<$B> <#264:1:B>  Okay  \n\n<$B> <#265:1:B>  Ya ya  \n\n<$A> <#266:1:A> So what I'm finding    with our group is\n\n  that one person does, something for twenty minutes and then the\n\nnext person does something and it doesn't fit at all with the thing that came\n\n  before it \n\n<$B> <#267:1:B>  Right right     right \n\n<$A> <#268:1:A>  You know   there's no, continuity\n<#269:1:A> So it seems like    we're   giving \n\n    lessons all   over the place \n\n<$B> <#270:1:B>  Is it happening in every group  \n<#271:1:B> Or do you get to observe any other groups   do it \n\n<$A> <#272:1:A>  Well the   thing is we were the first group so I\n\nthink we were a little bit  ,  you know\n<#273:1:A>   uh penalized in a way \n\n<$B> <#274:1:B>  Right  \n\n<$B> <#275:1:B>     who's your   teacher\n\n \n\n<$A> <#276:1:A>   We didn't have time to prepare \n\n<$B> <#277:1:B>    , who's the   teacher\n\n \n<#278:1:B> Uh his name is  Charles Batard \n<#279:1:B> He's a principal of an elementary school that does these intensive\n\nEnglish   courses \n\n<$B> <#280:1:B>  Oh okay  \n\n<$A> <#281:1:A> Or actually    intensive  \n\n   English   programs\n<#282:1:A> You know these kids that go for six months or something and they\n\ndo only   English \n\n<$B> <#283:1:B>  Mhh hmm  \n\n<$A> <#284:1:A> And uh he has his own little school in    St\n\n  Eustache\n<#285:1:A> And that's    actually where   I'm hoping to do my practicum, because\n\nI've heard that it's supposed to be really   an excellent excellent\n\nschool \n\n<$B> <#286:1:B>  Mhh really\n<#287:1:B> That particular   school\n\n<$A> <#288:1:A> Ya\n\n<$B> <#289:1:B> And the C T's are supposed to be very very uh\n<#290:1:B> Not only very very nice but also very very helpful and\n\nknowledgeable and they have lots of resources\n<#291:1:B> And I know somebody who did the practicum there last year  \n\nand she was \n\n<$B> <#292:1:B>  Can you ask   to go there\n\n<$A> <#293:1:A> I did   already and I'm waiting to find out now    if  , it will happen\n\n<$B> <#294:1:B>  <unclear> phrase </unclear> have, hmm  \n<#295:1:B> Because you know they have to, look at everybody's situation\n\nwhere everybody lives and you know divide people out\n<#296:1:B> So I'm hoping that I'll go there\n\n<$B> <#297:1:B> It's far\n\n<$A> <#298:1:A> It's far    I know but I don't     mind if I get a good \n\n<$B> <#299:1:B>  <unclear> three words </unclear> right  \n<#300:1:B> I don't blame you\n\n<$A> <#301:1:A> If I get a good spot    I   don't\n\ncare if it takes me   two hours  to get there\n\n<$B> <#302:1:B>  Mhh hmm  \n\n<$A> <#303:1:A>   I'll do it \n\n<$B> <#304:1:B>  And then when do you   start uh   to go\n\n\n\n<$A> <#305:1:A>  That'll be   in November\n<#306:1:A> The whole month of   November \n\n<$B> <#307:1:B>  Ya okay  \n\n<$A> <#308:1:A> Every day\n\n<$B> <#309:1:B> Mhh hmm\n\n<$A> <#310:1:A> Ya\n<#311:1:A> So uhm ya    I'm looking,

around thinking, well what's\n\ngoing on now\n It's been sort of six months\n It's been a year\n\n<$A>  the lying\n\n<$B>  And that's all\n\n\n<$A> \n\nler    he lied   with his actions\n\n<$B>  and I unfortunately allowed\n\nhis actions to speak for him, when I, should have said  Gary \n\n<,,>   , you know are you   interested in\n\npursuing this,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n  \n\n<$A> \n You grabbed control at one point\n\n<$B>  That's right,\n I had control and then I gave up control\n Like when I said are you interested in pursuing this relationship\n\n ,   \n\n he would say   yes,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  then I would say\n\n  fine uhm\n\n<$A> \n\nthen  he'd back off \n\n<$B> \n That's right\n so it would be well I just\n\ndidn't know    how to \n\n fit in and then I started to get angry, and frustrated because I\n\ndidn't want to feel like I had to fit into something\n Like, well all of the sudden I was compromising myself\n So, the frustration led to the confrontations and the\n\nconfrontations led to him bolting and that was it\n So, you know, there you go\n\n<$A> \n\n that you don't regret anything  \n\n<$B>  No, I don't regret a single thing,\n\n<$A>  about\n\nabout

\n\n<$B>  I mean maybe I\n\nshould just go and see if I could do    a   B Ed \n\n\n And, even if I were teaching part-time, or supply teaching\n\nI've already proven that, with the type of lifestyle I have doing a whole\n\nbunch of different jobs, matters   is fine \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Like I could work some shifts at the restaurant I can work at\n\nthe   museum  I could go and supply teach at a

to,\n\nwork with that age group\n They're annoying but they're also really really neat\n\n<$A>  Ya\n\n<$B>  Uhm, really neat\n\n<$A>  But you don't want to do anything therapy-wise\n

\n\n<$B>  or\n\n , with him or whatever,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  But uh,\n\n<$A>  We really had a lot in common\n he was very,\n\ncreative   and I got really  sucked into this, family\n\nbeing creative and we both skiied   , and   um\n\nwe had wonderful conversations and we would read together even though he \n\n,    you know  ,  just had\n\n  a high school education\n I mean it was just,\n\n\n there   was schizophrenia in the family,\n I can\'t actually even remember what happened then because,\n\n\npronounced Dal-who-sie  too\n It was awful\n And then his brother came to live with us when we were living on\n\nDalhousie\n Now where did the Dalhousie apartment get in there,\n I don\'t know\n I\'d have to actually like look at a calendar,\n to look at a\n\ndate book and sort of figure like, there were like five moves in a year\n\nthere,\n it was really\n\n<$B>  Does everybody in Ottawa call " Dalhousie "\n\n " Dalhousie " ,\n\n<$A>  call it\n\n<$B> ,\n\n\n\nDal-who-sie  until I  ,    moved

Monopoly,\n Okay the other thing was Scrabble,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> , but uh that\'s it exactly, he cheats\n day we were playing\n\nScrabble, with a group of people and he came up with this word,    you know  \n He had a zed\n Wanted to use a zed\n Got all these kajillion points and wanted to use all his letters\n\nand he came up with a word   and   put on the board this word\n\ncalled "  zwililogy  ", right\n\n<$B>  is so credible, and so kind, and\n\neverybody thinks he\'s such a nice guy, and, right,\n So, he ended up putting this word down, and, nobody\n\nwanted to seriously, challenge him on it, right\n\n<$B>  So that, mm\n turn,\n\n\nzwiliogy \n\n<$B>  And he says oh, it\'s a baby sperm whale,\n And everybody went, oh okay, and accepted it\n But that\'s the kind of stuff he does,\n And he does that to your dad all the time,\n He sucks him in like crazy all the time,\n \'\n\n and  Betty  \'s house one day, he told them that he had to \n\n  watch out for   the moose,\n\nbecause uhm,

already\n\n<$A>  Do you think so\n\n<$B>  Ya\n a\n\n  uh a   stimulation for him\n It motivates him during the lessons if he can go to the piano\n It's definitely a whole other concept for him,\n and

dinner at our house with all\n\n Brian's  family so you guys can come to that which you probably will\n\nreally like, which  Matt  will probably really   like \n\n<$B>  coming down this year\n\n<$A> \n\nsisters are great fans of my work and there's that show at city hall and,\n come\n\nhere, then we go there and it's,    you know \n\n,\n says I'm imagining it but it's just so Christian\n I just want like everybody to come here and just have it be like\n\nneutral in the forest    you know  \n want\n\nto come,\n They say they like to come the day after Christmas,\n Like a Boxing Day thing\n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$A>  So then we exchange some gifts and it's really great for the\n\nkids cos they play,\n to do\n don't know yet if the\n\ngallery is open at city hall,\n So what I wanted to do,\n I mean I don't want them to come, the day after Christmas but\n\n<,> that's when they want to come\n another\n\n  day   later \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Or, but in between Christmas and New Year's I asked them\n\nto come down\n So he has two sisters\n Between them they have, one two three five kids,\n And then he has a brother, who has, two kids, but\n\nthey're, uhm more like  Kevin's  age\n

Totally different physique\n totally different,\n\n<$B> \n Apparently I don't know how deep the conversation got but\n\napparently uh  Brian  was talking about his dad's death yesterday with\n\n Matt ,\n And uhm uh\n, just out of the clear blue\n\n Matt  said last night hey did you know that  Brian's  dad was\n\nonly sixty years old when he   died <unclear> one or two words\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$A>  been talking about that recently\n\n<$B>  Ah okay\n\n<$A>  Ya,\n a lot of wholes\n\n  a whole lot of stuff   about his family\n Not bad stuff, but just uh,\n There's a lot of,\n He was the oldest son and he worked the hardest and\n\n \n\n his brother got stuff   and his father died\n And, he didn't, go a lot when his father was ill\n kept saying you should come to the\n\nhospital now but he couldn't stand going cos  ,  he\n\n  had  ,  all these   tubes stuck in\n\nhim and everything and\n\n<$B> \n Ya\n\n<$A>  So then he died and he wasn't there when he died\n Oh that's it,\n We were just talking about something the other day, and he\n\nsaid uhm,\n Oh we were watching something on T V and I said is that what they\n\ndid with your father\n had to pull the\n\nplug, like they had to all make the decision,\n And that actually,\n I mean I guess I knew it was happening at the time but, I was\n\njust more like concerned with the way  Brian  was reacting and I\n\nwasn't,\n\n\n sort of like a   second layer right\n Like we weren't in Toronto we were here\n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$A>  was asked to go and he did go for a couple\n\ndays and just basically like, visited his mom and sat and looked at his\n\ndad with all these things going in him and the machine making him breathe and\n\n    Brian       just  ,  can't   handle that\n\n<$B>  Ya,\n\n<$A>  talked about\n\nthat,\n So that only like two days ago,\n We didn't talk about much\n It was very casual it's like, while we're like, doing the\n\ndishes   or something  it's not\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  if it isn't some kind of crisis\n\n coming or something\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\njust recently been thinking about it\n If there was something\n it's not\n\nthat   ,\n\n<$A>  it,\n\n<$B>  No but it's not the type of stuff that he normally talks to\n\n Matt  about\n I guess maybe they haven't been alone and having a conversation\n\nalong those   <unclear> three or four words </unclear> \n\n<$A>  to have a friend\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n<$A>  so maybe he's,\n How did it come up,\n\n<$B>  I have no idea\n a chance to\n\ntalk to  Matt  about it\n Just out of the clear blue he just,\n mentioned his dad and said that he died at sixty\n\nisn't that bizarre and he started to tell me a little bit about how he died\n Cos I didn't realize that he had, died when he went in for\n\n<,,> uh his  you know a lung,   operation \n\n<$A> \n He had the lung transplant\n\n<$B>  Ya,\n See I didn't realize that\n I thought he, had died just from severe asthma\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  fit eh,\n but this\n was like totally fit\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  told him\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n say to  Brian  on a regular basis\n be like your dad\n\nlike the doctor tells you,\n,\n Like he knew for years that his lungs were going right\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  stop farming\n They had a bed and breakfast\n They had\n\n up\n\nuntil like,\n on Christmas we went there when I first started living\n\nwith him,\n and he\n\n<,> hooked up all the    the horses \n\n, these, Belgian workhorses and uhm he took us for a ride around\n\nthe farm on the sleigh,\n\n<$A>  I mean it was a great, picture\n\n<$B> \n But I mean he was sick for like days after that,

from\n\nanother place\n\n\nlaugh \n You know he bothers girls even when they don't like him\n\n all this stuff\n He gets into fights and he gets drunk and, at the end of it he\n\nkills this dog right and sort of swears him to secrecy\n And then, you know like he's freaking out\n\n\nright  \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Reg\n\n away\n 's family\n\narrives and he\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  him\n\nis a rest\n\n<$B>  right\n\n<$A>  Mhh\n\n<$B>  And so all of us still sat down and we all read it and we all\n\nlaughed, and said well we're going to have to say this is a fictional\n\nthing\n this story like before it the\n\nguy says you know I'm changing the name, of my cousin   \n\nyou know    so     no one will know who it\n\nis but I mean if you know who the guy is, it's not hard to trace down his\n\ncousins\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  I'm sure you can trace down\n\nwho his cousin is  and find out that this guy killed the dog\n\n  \n\n\n<$A>  dear,\n So the guy's an embarrassment to his

females writers\n has this huge preoccupation with death\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  uhm had\n\nsomething to do with someone dying, you know committing suicide or\n\n<$A> \n\nit's the forefront   thing    in   your mind\n\n , like  at the moment\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  You know what I mean\n If there's a lot of suicides in that area you're naturally going\n\nto think about those things when you think about home\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n\n not a very healthy indication of, the town\n\n\nyou know    your   youth's major preoccupation is\n\ndeath and suicides and whatnot I mean, obviously   \n\nthere's   something wrong there\n you know\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n anyhow \n\n\n<$A> \n\n\nWeben       Webequie    \n\n<$B>  Webequie\n\n\n\n I mean people just don't see that\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n other scandalous stories  and they get   off on that\n\na lot  more\n\n<$A> \n That's true\n\n<$B>  But I mean the guy is a scandal\n He should just get out of there\n\n<$A>  Ya\n\n<$B>  reason why I\n\nthink he's holding on so much is he's got a lot of <unclear> two words\n\n</unclear>,\n\n\n  uh with     , such a   grip\n\nunless there is something there\n\n<$A>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$B>  kind of obvious\n\n ,  when your financial statements that you hand in\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  You're supposed to hand in your financial statements every\n\nyear\n And the statements that you hand in are two years out of date\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  your\n\n  your   holding company\n\n\nand that \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Well could you imagine them refusing to give their annual\n\nstatements at a uh annual band meeting of everybody\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\nWebequie  for Sageen\n\n<$A>  But many times those things are presented uh uh to the public\n\n<,> and the public don't understand what they're about   anyway \n\n<$B> \n,\n\n so I mean\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  I know the first years uh I went to the Band Council meetings\n\nat home, hardly anyone ever questioned the amounts of money   , that they were   being asked to to pass  \n\n<,,>  to approve for whatever, project was going on\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  became such ah, a white\n\nelephant in the end\n you know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  to bury\n\nthat and you can't bury it\n It's going to come up all the time,\n\n<$B>  That's probably why you see an entire new Band Council there\n\n<$A>  It could be\n It could be,\n But uh you don't or people seem to be afraid to speak out and say\n\nwell,    uh I don't think   you should,\n\ngive them any more money\n\n\n<$B> \n\n it's   because when you do speak out,    uh, you get   singled out,\n You know what I mean\n people, sitting up there\n\nthat are supposed to be listening to you and looking for your, responses\n\nand whatnot attack you\n\n<$A>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$B>  embarrassing\n\nto be attacked\n\n First of all they're sitting higher than you\n You know like usually they're not even the same level\n\n<$A> \n\n, three  - quarters    of the  \n\npublic that you're sitting with, will feel, the way that they do\n because they're sitting in that position\n\n\n  and attack   the system that they're you\n\nknow\n\n,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n like what they did to the\n\ntrappers\n\n\n used Cree

so\n\n<,> we gave that one to  Larry \n\n\n<$B> \n Well I want one of those\n\n<$A>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$B>  Actually I've been wanting a spider plant\n Did you get the spider plant from there too\n\n<$A>  Ya\n\n\n<$B>  know\n\n<$A>  And they weren't expensive at all\n\n<$B>  purchased them\n\n<$A>  It's through a journal transfer\n\n<$B>  Okay\n\n<$A>  uh\n\ntransfer it \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Ya\n Uh no\n We had Distribution bring them over\n\n<$B>  Okay,\n\n<$A> , huh you could\n\ncharge   it to your budget and then write a cheque   to the\n\n university\n\n<$B> \n Okay,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  what you did,\n\n<$A>  All of them are the office plants so when I leave I have to\n\nleave them unless I choose to purchase them\n\n<$B>  Right so I mean I would basically want to do the same,\n\n<$A>  was to bring one home I\n\nwould purchase it  ,  or if I were to ever leave the office\n\nthen I'd have to either do a journal transfer to my other office or purchase\n\nthem outright\n\n<$B> \n That's it\n But I wouldn't mind having a nice big tree,\n\n<$A>  Hmm\n\n<$B>  He doesn't have too many things that are big\n\n<$A>  I know\n\n<$B>  I had hoped that that would be bigger, and since it isn't\n\nI put it on the radiator to make it look taller,\n And it's also close to the, door\n\n\ngreen \n\n<$A> ,\n No it's nice,\n And I like your mirror\n\n<$B>  I told you that before\n With the wood\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  my brother gave me that\n He didn't want it\n\n<$A>  Oh,\n were in Zellers the other day\n\nand they were selling park benches you know like   , for\n\n  thirty bucks\n\n<$B>  Wow\n\n<$A>  With the wrought iron\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$A> \n\n in   the front\n that side there\n\n<$B> \n A small little one\n\n<$A>  Well it's a two-seater\n\n<$B>  Hmm\n That's nice\n\n<$A>  I thought it would be\n\n<$B>  Is it really a two-seater or is it a one and a half\n Did you try and sit in it\n\n<$A>  two and a\n\nhalf\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nand I   and both the kids were sitting    on \n\n it\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  like squeezed in\n\n<$B>  Uh huh uh huh\n\n<$A>  Ya\n like we\n\ncould,\n\n<$B>  Oh that's nice,\n\n<$A>  Well\n\n<$B>  So you've been doing some major shopping\n\n<$A>  We didn't buy it\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  We were discussing it,\n\n<$B>  I want it\n\n<$A>  And we have to buy a new, carpet or something for it\n\nbecause    it's   awful\n That carpet is ripped and\n\n<$B>  The indoor-outdoor\n\n<$A>  Ya\n We're scared of ripping it up\n We don't know what's going to be underneath it\n So, I don't know\n\n\n\n\n<$B>  whatever you rip up,\n\nbecause there's probably glue\n\n<$A>  Oh I'm sure that\n spots there\n\n<$B> \n Mhh hmm\n\n<$A>  So we were going to go with, brown carpeting\n beigey, dark brown,\n\ncolour   that will  match the house more\n\n<$B> \n Can you get indoor-outdoor carpeting that colour\n\n<$A>  Yup,\n in two colours green or brown\n\n<$B> \n Mhh\n You used to be able to get it I think in grey or black or\n\nsomething   too \n\n<$A>  and you can\n You can\n But I thought\n I don't know,\n\n\n<$B> \n\n more like an asphalt at that point\n\n<$A>  Ya\n It didn't sort of\n\n\ntogether and blend   together \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n the   green you    want to  ,\n\nwith the grass but it's such an artificial green and it never really meshes\n\nwith the grass\n\n<$B>  Uh huh\n\n<$A>  It should be like a, forest green rather than a, what\n\nkind\n\n\n<$B>  laugh\n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Shamrock green exactly,\n\n<$A>  So no forest green would have been better\n\n\n<$B>  that's it\n That's it\n Must be from your shark days\n\n<$A>  Yes yes\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  the\n\n  the   design art graduates show    the\n\n vernissage    took place at Sharks, in the pool\n\nhall  ,  and    it was   like\n\nstepping into another world\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Have you been to that place\n\n<$B>  No no\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B> \n\n   environments  aren't they \n\n<$A> \n\n vernissage  was in the private room at the back which has its\n\nown bar and a couple of pool tables\n There's two different kinds of pool tables like a smaller one and\n\na larger one\n\n\n<$B>  and Boston\n\n<$A>  Ya\n\n\n<$B>  a lot\n\n<$A> \n Uh well I've played a little bit but, nothing to really speak\n\nof\n But it was fun to watch them play,\n But to walk in, to this place\n It's underground\n It's in the basement\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Ya\n Maybe they're not that low but the lighting is\n Right\n The lighting comes down, so I think it gives that, uh\n\nfeeling of low ceilings\n Very dark except for all these lit pool tables\n There's smoke you know there's this because of the nightclub kind\n\nof atmosphere\n And there's music and everybody's sort of playing and they're\n\nserious looking and, almost gruesome\n\n<$B>  Sounds like a movie\n\n<$A>  like in another\n\nworld\n I thought oh this has been going on\n,\n There was almost an air of toughness\n\n<$B>  was there\n\n\n<$A> \n\nthe show was   in the   foire boive  \n Was in some of the space, which was actually a bar, but\n\nthere was no bar set up\n I'll show you it\n You know it's on the second floor and it's, on the southwest\n\ncorner\n\n<$B>  Okay\n\n<$A>  And it was, quite interesting\n It was on two levels,\n And they had it displayed\n of course\n\n   uhh experts you know   in display would\n\ntell you why it wasn't working\n uh some of the lighting was quite poor on

volunteered\n\n<$A> \n Ya exactly\n Anabelle\n\n when we were camping uhm uh\n is uhm the little girl who has alopecia\n She has no hair\n\n<$B>  Ya ya\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  by the way\n\n<$A>  Oh there's only a twenty percent chance that her hair will\n\never grow back\n\n<$B>  How did they derive at that,\n\n<$A>  At the twenty percent\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  I think it's just on past experience with\n\npatients that have,   alopecia  totalis\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Uhm there are other forms of alopecia where the alopecia comes\n\nand goes, but because she's lost all her body   hair  uhm uh \n\n  she   has been declared as alopecia totalis and\n\nonly twenty percent of the cases have actually, grown back hair\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And sometimes only, for only ah a very short period of time\n\nand then they lose it again\n that\n\nshe   that     ,  it  \n\n  grows back ya and in one fell swoop and that\n have partial\n that would be harder to deal with\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n Mhh\n\n<$A>  But uhm, things haven't changed much\n uh that\n\nshe's   had it\n Anyway it's quite a problem now because, she plays soccer\n\n and I\n\nthink it probably applies as well    uhm to   house\n\nleague soccer you're not allowed to wear a baseball cap  , \n\nbecause the peak of the cap can be quite dangerous  <-> if\n collide or\n\nsomebody can get it in the eye or something\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  wear a tam though like\n\n<$A>  No she wouldn't wear a tam\n\n\n realize that, she's at an age now where, she's going to have her\n\nown preferences\n,\n\nthose  sort of western-looking bandanas\n\n<$B> \n And uhm, that was okay but uhm I think she still felt a bit\n\nlike a sore thumb and, so what happened was uhm the girl that used to\n\nbabysit her, is quite a sewer  and so she,\n\ndesigned a little kerchief kind of thing\n It's like a bandana but it's shaped in somewhat of a triangular\n\nshape, uhm out of black fabric\n Their colours are black and orange and yellow\n So she came up with this black fabric and she designed this\n\ntriangular shape that would be easy for them to wear\n And uh they took it to the company that does the uniforms and they\n\nhad the logo  , uh  put on the bandana in the front\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And uhm they had two of them made\n like\n\nher   friend who supports her\n It happens to be the lady whose son it happens to be her daughter\n Uhm she is a really big supporter and she feels that if she's\n\nwearing one it's going to make the little girl with alopecia feel more\n\ncomfortable\n And so the whole team wants them now,\n ya\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  So, they went back and said they wanted more and the guy\n\ncame up with some outrageous figure of eighteen dollars per bandana\n I said that's crazy\n So I suggested to them that maybe they go and see this guy who\n\nmakes the caps and maybe he can do something,\n trying different\n\ndesigns last year, to come up with something for her but nothing that he\n\ncame up with, she felt comfortable with, but she really likes this\n\nbandana\n\n\nbut      I   don't know, it gives them\n\nthat kind of mean edge   that I suppose you need  \n\n as a   competitive sports player you know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  But I said what a wonderful thing\n The whole team decided that, they liked them, and they\n\nwanted to wear them for her sake\n kids\n\n \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Ya\n\n<$B>  That's so heartwarming\n\n<$A>  they told me that I said wow what a\n\ngood team\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  But they've been playing together for a number of years\n She's been playing inter-city now for, at least two years\n This is probably her third year\n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm,\n in soccer\n\n<$A>  Ya she starts tonight\n playing\n is\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  She plays house league though\n She doesn't play inter-city\n I don't want her playing inter-city\n\n<$B>  the difference\n\n\n<$A>  you're\n\n  playing against other teams  ,  from other cities\n\n<$B> \n Right\n\n<$A>  So you could be playing Lachine or you could be playing St\n\nLaurent\n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$A>  And most of the games are at six six-thirty at night\n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$A>  up get\n\n them in their uniforms and get them    they all, really   understand the game\n you were to put\n\nsomebody in there that didn't know how to play   I think they'd get a\n\nlittle creamed you know \n\n<$B>  right\n\n<$A>  So she'd be better off to go into Atom\n guy's name,\n there's a couple people\n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A>  no, no no\n is five\n\n<$B>  Five and a half\n\n\n<$A>  he could play\n He can play\n No problem\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  When I registered I think it was sixty or\n\nsixty-five\n But then if\n That was in February\n If you late registered in March it was a little bit more\n\n<$B>  Mhh\n\n<$A>  So I would think it might be around seventy or seventy-five\n\n  dollars  is my guess,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm,\n\n<$A>  And that's his phone number\n\n<$B>  Do\n\n<$A> \n\n<,,>\n And I'll get his number for you\n He's probably the key person to speak with I would think\n Uhm, so they,\n, and\n\nin terms of  Henry ,    I think\n\nhe'd   be in Junior Atom\n\n<$B> \n Mhh hmm\n\n<$A> , were talking about an elite\n\nteam which was,    sort of like an   inter-city\n\nteam, uhm at that age level and that's what they were thinking of putting\n\n Charlie  on but I said no I'm not interested in that because

\n\n<$A>  he\'s like he\'s\n\n  you know I guess he   had an itch or two and he starts like\n\nyou know licking and scratching parts of his leg, which of course would\n\nhave been great to include in

I   did make up, well\n\ndidn\'t make up but I recalled some behaviours of my past which I kind of\n\nincluded but this    would have   been great you\n\nknow\n\n<$A> \n\ncould put in was I saw one like start scratching itself like just, had a\n\nspazzy itch there but this guy was like licking himself and   all this\n\n\n\n<$B> \n Grooming\n\n<$A>  li\n\n   like   there was one of them  \n\n I think he   was a male\n\n<$B>  Uh huh\n\n<$A>  make that guess I\n\ndidn\'t see really any teats there but, doesn\'t really   matter \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n which I knew were females because they had teats and, and obviously\n\nthey had been like they had had kids this year or   whatever \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  But this guy didn\'t seem to have anything but I mean it could\n\nhave been like a virgin female but anyway\n really calm though, like unusually calm\n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A> \n\nthey   quickly   the way they   eat their nuts like\n\nthey\'re   <unclear> two or three words </unclear>  like    they\'re      going to  \n\nhave indigestion like if we eat that fast,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n  it was sort of   unusual\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  So cute\n\n<$B>  Huh\n\n<$A>  So that was it\n, man\n\nthat routine eh\n\n\n  uh you know his   hole  \n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  little lawn\n\nchair that we have there, looks around\n completely immobile\n Then he runs off, grabs the nut never goes too far eh\n\n<$B>  Okay\n\n<$A>  two words\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$B>  I mean chipmunks don\'t live in trees,\n\n<$A>  I don\'t know\n\n<$B>  have like a\n\n  ground dwelling  chipmunk or something\n\n<$A> \n I don\'t know no I got the impression they didn\'t\n\nlive in trees\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  I thought they\'d live on the ground,\n sigh\n\n  I    don\'t know\n\n \n\n<$B>  Hm\n\n<$A>  Anyway, he never goes far from his hole\n\n<$B>  Okay\n\n<$A>  And he comes running back\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  And then uhh real nervous-like cos he pops back into his\n\nthing\n I saw him shove a few nuts like I saw him

 it\'s not \n\n just his cheeks eh, it\'s like his cheek and lower neck,  \n\nlike his whole \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Anyways it\'s sort of interesting to imagine how big the pouch\n\nis because he shoves

that\'s you know\n\n<$A> \n\n\nlaugh  \n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n<$A>  I thought maybe that was it a cat that\'d uh, you know\n\nthat had somehow creeped into   , to the  \n\narea but I didn\'t see anything\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A> \n\nfunny\n\n<$B>  Hmm\n\n<$A>  So that\'s it,\n They\'re so sweet\n\n<$B> \n\n  we need one of those   paint guns, chase\n\ncats away with, er, not chase them away but\n\n<$A>  Not paint guns you mean uh Super Soakers\n\n<$B>  yeah that\'s true they hate to get wet but a\n\npaint gun would be pretty effective too\n\n<$A>  a paint gun\n\n\n\n<$B>  well not\n\nsomething really  not something   that\'s, you know \n\n<$A> ,\n\nmy friend, a guy I  in animal behaviour class we were    supposed   to get into a group and like we\'re\n\nsupposed to discuss   that, \n\n something   important,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  didn\'t understand what it was so we\n\nended up degenerating on animal  on animal topics   , \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  was talking about the time he\'d gone\n\n uh cat bowling   and \n\n\n\n<$B>  Oh I remember him telling about\n\nthat,\n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n<$A>  this other guy was\n\nlike he heard him saying how the best way to train a cat was to get, was\n\nto get like a Super Soaker gun\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  And he says what you do is, he says it works for anything\n\n ,  you could just   decide one day that\n\nthere\'s one square foot of ground that you don\'t want your cat to stand in\n\n   \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  For no reason at all\n Cos this is what he did and he put like you can even mark it off\n\nif you want\n There\'s this one square foot of ground that you just don\'t want\n\n and everytime he gets there you squirt him with the uh, with\n\nthe gun\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  well also and then\n\nthey were suggesting things like yeah then every time you leave the house you\n\nhave to put a cover over that piece of ground so he doesn\'t you know, so\n\nif he steps on it like it was different cos if you stepped on it\n Anyway\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  saying it\n\nreally worked and then you get this cat that basically will not go near,\n\none square   foot of ground  for absolutely no reason you know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  two

like you know, yes\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Well not the greatest but I feel a lot more prepared than I\n\nwas \n Cos yesterday I was just like ah my God you know,\n you know I'm walking out of

Anyway,\n\n<$B>  Right after you sold it\n\n<$A>  Well, I managed to sell it\n\n<$B>  Okay\n\n<$A>  And then anyway not long I know the next genetics course I\n\nthink they had a better book,\n So,

just in terms of the, the\n\nstrictness\n it\n\nwas  whether they agreed with it or not  it\'s   what they had\n\nto do,\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  Novak\n\n came in our geography teacher \n Ah man poor guy,\n But he came in from a public school,\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  And uh,\n I mean\n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nthere was just   there had been   just too much talking in the\n\nstudy hall at one point and so we were like severely reprimanded right \n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  the whole school\n\n  had to come in and for like a I    don\'t know\n\n  twenty-minute sit in of being super quiet for punishment \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n\nunderstand that\'s the way it was \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n And of course all the faculty finds out that the kids and the\n\nstudents are in trouble\n found out the kids\'re in

such a,\n\nyou know like I mean of course in real life it\'s so silly but it\'s the way it\n\nwas you know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  it gave a certain discipline I suppose\n\n\n Or they tried to instill that in us I mean it\'s so\n That\'s why when I got to school when you do\n\n\n  you realize   all these stupid things\n\nare like, irrelevant sort of thing\n I mean you kind of realize I supppose their point to what they did\n They instill something in you but\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A> \n\nlike that    kind of   punishment was just stupid\n\nyou know it\'s not    going to   get you anywhere\n You have to really been bad it just, you know what I mean\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<,> So   Mrs     Malone\n\n   oh my math teacher\n\n\nback of me and she hates uh \n\n\nhated us cos we were wiseasses\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And\n\n<$B>  smartass people\n\n<$A> \n\nDanielle  hated Mrs  Malone  and anyway and I was just sort of\n\nlike\n\n<$A>  She was a good math teacher though I\'ll give her that, she\n\nwas a good math teacher but   on a  personality level we didn\'t\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nbetcha   bet you     that some people that can go with\n\nthe flow sort of like what they\'re\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  in the fact that she had\n\nthe power over you\n\n<$B>  Oh yeah\n\n<$A>  But I mean she was a good math teacher and that\'s all that\n\ncounted\n\n\n<$B>  Okay\n\n<$A>  when\n\nshe,   when she   came in class    she  had this paper    but she got this habit into\n\n ,  dangling   a paperclip off her lips \n\n  kind of   like a cigarette, you know,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nhanging   there\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n was just back of me\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  Mrs\n\n Malone  would be talking whatever and  Danielle  would crack\n\nthese wiseass comments\n\n<$B>  And of course you\'re the only one to hear them\n\n<$A>  I\'m the only\n She\'s just looking\n\n  at Mrs  Malone  and she\'s talking just sort of through her\n\nlips like that \n\n<$B>  Uh huh\n\n<$A> \n\nsomething and I was like \n\n<$B> \n\n your lips it was like " how    about \n\n a brick " you know sort of thing   like that \n\n<$A> \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> really    but she\'d  \n\n   sort of   talk like that and she had the\n\npaperclip there and she\'d laugh like hu hu hu huh \n\n<$B>  She was\n\nlike   Beavis \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  She was just looking straight ahead she had this like fixed\n\nfacial expression with the thing    hanging  \n\nout of her, and she\'s like     how about a brick   you know and then I\'d be like\n\n and then she\'d be like hu hu hu huh,\n\nand then  who\'d get in trouble right, me \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  threatened one day that I\'d be kicked\n\n\n I\n\npredict, that you will get kicked out of Cégep  \n\n<unclear> three or four words </unclear>   I\'ll get    kicked out   of a Cégep math class\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> , Don\'t ask me why\n looked at her and\n\nwent, uh huh, do you \n\n<$B>  be pretty bad to\n\nget kicked out of a   Cégep math class don\'t you  >\n\n<$A> , la la it\n\nwas sort of an irrelevant  strep \n\n\n Later on like, months later would just sit by and she goes,\n\n I predict,   \n\n   then of course   I start laughing\n\nagain \n\n<$B> \n\nin front of everybody,\n\n<$A>  it was just like\n\n   these\'re   quiet comments to me\n\n<$B>  uh\n\n   I predict     that \n\n<$A>  it was in front of everyone yeah\n\n<$B>  Oh really\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  probably\n\n  right,\n\n<$A>  I was just sort of like okay whatever\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> , total indifference\n\n<$A>  What do you say\n\n  to that like it\'s not really that \n\n\n<$B> ,\n\n<$A>  Anyway so and I know the,\n you feel like\n\nyou\'re  </unclear>  getting in trouble when you\'re\n\nlaughing at someone \n Cos the joke that someone else made\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A> \n\n I   we\'d   always sit up front\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  Second row, up front\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A> \n\ncos ,  cos   they wouldn\'t check you out they wouldn\'t keep\n\na close eye on you if you were in the second row because they figure you were\n\ntoo close to do anything mischievous   so they were     scoping   out the back row all the morons who    want to   sit in the back to

\n\n<$B>  Really\n\n<$B>  view\n\n<$A>  bang\n\n<$B> \n\n, \n\n<$A> \n Selective view it\'s\n And I just remember once it was just so, I don\'t think I can\n\nexplain it to you but it, we laughed so\n uh, oh like\n\ndid you ever have the books called the Wordly Wise,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  it\'s just to increase\n\nyour vocabulary right so you had this list of new words you had to learn\n You had to look up the words in the dictionary then you had to use\n\nthese words in sentences and all that  you know that crap\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  new words\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  And one of the words I don\'t

are just    cracking  \n\njust these stupid comments   you know \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  oh can you imagine you\n\nknow    the guy   sort of, you know  , like  the guy  \n Like for example they\'re having a

like ah\n\nwouldn\'t that be funny and then  Danielle  just goes yeah and then the\n\n and then   the teacher goes  have a\n\nnice day  \n\n\nreason, it was just too funny\n\n\nfive or six words

of\n\nlaughter you know and so    that   was a pretty\n\nbad \n\n\n<$B>  in our school\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  falls asleep on\n\nher desk right, our English teacher,    takes\n\n  a this was uh Mr

rest of the class  you know\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  She's uh and then,\n who was uh who was known to\n\nhave  like he was a very good math teacher    and \n\n a certain amount of  but  he was known to have \n\n quite a temper so you didn't, dick around you know\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  So we'd always cheat right at the beginning of the exam,\n\nbecause he always relied   , upon his uh \n\n his reputation\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B>  sittn\n\n  sitting   there    reading  \n\nnot    paying   attention to anything at all,\n\nand then the last half of the exam he'd take and    you know like he'd   look around and watch people when they\n\nwere done and everything like that,  tell  \n\n them   okay you can leave you know\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  He'd make a few people stay until like about half the class\n\nwas done and then he'd say okay you can leave the rest of you,    just   finish up your exam and everything\n And so like at the beginning of the exam we'd just turn to all the\n\nhard questions and do them and look back and forth and\n\n\nand we'd take   and we'd switch   our papers back   and\n\nforth from  yeah oh yeah  \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Switch our papers back and forth from desk to desk, we'd\n\nlook at what the other person had done just so you know and then    we'd switch back   and we'd do the\n\nproblem that we'd just seen the other person do,  and if we\n\ngot the same answer we just    kind of   look\n\nover and you know like this  we   \n\nkind of   hold our tests up to each other   it was so funny\n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  It was so hilarious because you knew that like all the tough\n\nones were    going to   be at the end and all the\n\neasy ones're    going to   be at the beginning so\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n    all the   tough ones at the end\n\nand then, the end of the exam you did the easy ones, so   it was\n\npretty \n\n<$A> \n\nswitched exams once in Cégep    when   \n\n   one guy    actually passed out, in class cos    I\n\nguess he'd   been

\n\n<$A>  Like he was an old sort of\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  teacher\n they had to take\n\nhim out <unclear>  cos this is  </unclear> an unusual situation so the\n\nteacher you know, take him  <unclear> two words\n\n</unclear>  go and she takes him out\n I\n\njust, <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B>  are\n\nstunned\n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  and\n\nthen, ah  Teri ,     \n\n what did you     get for number three    \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nTeri  she made a mistake  so anyway,\n\n\n don't know   if you remember he's in computer science so  ,  we saw him in the   uh, at the\n\nairport at Concordia a little while ago, with you me and  Jesse \n\n<$B>  Mmm\n\n<$A>  Was a guy blond shortish guy came by and I introduced you his\n\nname was  Ben  but we named him  Bender \n\n<$B>  Huh, you just name people other things, really\n\n<$A>  laugh starts\n\n class \n, He got that cos he only showed up for six hours of his calculus\n\nterm\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  character from the movie The\n\nBreakfast Club  never went to class   <unclear> four or five words\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\ndunno   don't know   did   didn't   see enough\n\nof the film to really\n\n<$A>  Okay so\n\n<$B>  true\n\n<,> anything that happens, anything like that that happens you have to\n\ntake advantage of it\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  You know\n,\n\n my God\n\n<$A>  well you know\n\n<$B>  How stupid can you be you know\n Like you just don't put your name on it\n\n<$A>  That's funny they could pass it out and then they\n\n<$B> \n\nsomething comes down or somebody says something, you know\n And they say oh let's see your exam and you go here, you know\n\nthere it is, ahem, and unless you got a whole   \n\nlot of   essay questions, and you got this really flowery\n\nhandwriting you know\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B> \n\n    sort of   thing,\n\n There were a few things like that you know the teacher has to leave\n\nthe room or there's a call for the teacher or something like that,\n Soon as they close the door it's like number two\n\n<$A>  I\n\nmean \n\n<$B>  course not\n\n<$A>  I mean that was a different\n I guess she had to take that into consideration\n So funny\n\n\n told you this before but, you know  Molly \n, the guy who taught you economics,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Marlene\n\n was in my class\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Uh huh\n\n<$A> \n\nprobly   probably   told you this before but she used to often\n\nfall asleep in class but she had like a,\n\n<$B> \n\nbit of a physical thing\n\n<$A> \n\ncond  yeah  \n\n\npass out for several classes\n Probably\n\n  the only person   that could, well get away with it I\n\nmean    all the teachers \n\n had been notified or whatever  ,  that she had something\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  I guess she\n\ncouldn't  \n Was she an insomniac maybe I don't know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n could fall asleep before maybe two in the morning\n\n<$B>  Oh wow\n\n<$A>  And when you're in high school,\n\n<$B>  rough\n\n<$A> \n\n  half the time I don't go to bed until three \n\n<$B>  that's what time I usually go to\n\nsleep, yeah  \n\n<$A>  You know whatever\n But it was like\n\n<$B>  Some of us are idiots and stay up till seven\n\n<$A>  But\n\n<$B>  But we won't go into that\n\n<$A>  No we won't\n\n<$B>  We won't go there,\n\n<$A>  conked\n\nout for like several classes \n No one'd ever say anything\n\n<$B> \n 's\n\noffice today because   I had the new  \n\n contracts drawn up and I also had    the    labels\n So I got the labels done and they didn't come out too bad\n\n<$A>  Good\n\n<$B>  change\n\nthe uh   I    got to   change  \n\n   the   company, uhh font\n defeated sigh\n\n it's just not    happening  \n font\n\n   not heavy   letters \n\n So it would look different than the heavy letters that are below\n\nit\n Just doesn't work\n\n<$A>  Bad idea\n\n<$B>  take and\n\nredo them\n\n\nBenjamin      and see if\n\n  I can get some more of those labels cos I can't seem to find them\n\n<,>\n Those diskette labels, can't seem to find them anywhere so,\n So there it is\n what was my point of this\n\n<,>\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  I dropped by uhh\n\nPricewaterhouse  today, and I was by\n\nthe mailroom, and    I just   knew  Jolene\n\n 's extension so I punched her up and uh she goes hello and I said hey yo\n\n J  what's up and  and there was just this pause\n I'm at the\n\nmailroom she's like oh   like  \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  It was like, you know it was uh\n leave this\n\n  you know just leave this   envelope or do you have time to\n\ncome down and she said she was busy so I just put it in an envelope\n\n<$A>  After\n\nthat comment  she probably   couldn't face you you know\n\n<$B> \n Exactly\n\n<$A>  I don't know he's a bit weird\n\n     don't you   think \n\n<$B> \n\n got that black lingo you know, he talks that way\n\n<$B>  I'm\n\njust      going to   try and be\n\nsickeningly nice to  Jolene  and  ,  you know I\n\njust   won't care   even if she's \n\n<$A>  nice to her that's\n\nprobably going to irritate her even more\n That's the key\n\n<$B> \n\ngonna   going to   be really nice but   \n\nlike I'm just      going to   be short\n\nand just say here take this to  Pedro  oh you have something for me\n\ngood I'll be nice and pleasant and everything like that and if she's not nice\n\nback well you know    I   won't be\n\ntalking to her long enough to really notice you know\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  the end if\n\nshe wants to be nice then fine you know\n If she doesn't then you know, well what can you do\n\n<$A>  No it's a good policy,\n Because if she is deliberately trying to be mean on the off-hand\n\nchance then your pleasantness is    going to  \n\ndrive her crazy\n\n<$B>  Yeah because I'm just not you know,\n Whatever she says I'm just you know,\n\n\n going to   be uh ,  not    going to\n\n  be affected  \n But no I don't think she goes out of her way to be mean I think\n\nshe's just not a\n\n<$A>  No yeah\n\n<$B>  She not a happy dancing person by nature, so\n Which is too bad,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  So anyway business went pretty well today actually\n I talked to this guy, the guy who's makes the decisions on this\n\nhe came\n said oh I'll\n\nshow it to  John  when he gets back and  John  came in, so I\n\nshowed it all to him and explained it all to him and everything like that\n He's in league with four stores cos he's moving his place right\n\nnow, he's getting another store in Laval I think, and he's also getting\n\ntogether with a company that has two stores themselves,\n I mean he says you know\n\n the next time we talk    uhh   probably \n\n I'll get you to bring up like twenty twenty-five copies,\n

to think   Ryan used to hate my mom  \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Like she was a real bitch\n And that\'s why they never got along because he hardly ever talked\n\nto her because he thought she was a

minutes I'm at school\n Okay\n\n<$B> \n\n ten minutes easy\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B> , And that's where I catch the bus\n But I usually catch a bus from here to downtown anyway cos,\n\n<$A>  You're lazy\n\n<$B> , Well it doesn't cost me any more\n\n<$A>  True\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  You get to sleep in an extra\n\nfive minutes \n\n<$B> \n\ncould get down there faster if I walked because, what I do is I get all\n\nready to go and I look at the clock and I think oh geez I better go catch the\n\nbus\n\n\n miss it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  So I go out there and then I wait for like ten minutes and\n\nthen I'm like fuck why am I out here so early\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  But,\n\n<$A>  Alright\n\n<$B> \n\nit probably wouldn't take me as much time  \n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B> , If I, walked\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  walk home every night so I figure that's\n\nmy good deed,\n\n\nphysical education   three times a week Monday Wednesday and Friday\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> ,\n\n\nword </unclear> and stuff \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Yeah so it keeps me pretty active so\n And also tomorrow night I'm going to go to the arena and see about\n\nstarting skating again down here\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Cos my mom said she'd pay for it so,\n or\n\nanything like that \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Anything your parents pay for take it\n\n\n<$B>  want to\n\n  try and finish my last test\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  I think that would be a good idea, and uh, well I think\n\nI can do it so\n\n<$A> \n\n your last test\n\n<$B>  Well I can take as long as I want\n\n<$A> \n And then after that what can you do\n\n<$B>  Whatever I want\n\n<$A>  Can teach or\n\n<$B>  taught last year\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  In Deep River\n But uhm, it goes something like this\n Finishing all your tests is kind of like having like a university\n\ndoctorate\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  And uh, you know finishing like a couple of them is like\n\ngoing to like grade school high school    kind of \n\n thing and\n\n<$A>  Ah\n\n<$B>  It's just\n get\n\npaid more the more tests you have the more experience you have\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  like that so,\n\n<$B>  I did a year of coaching already, and uh I was getting\n\npaid twenty dollars an hour, then\n\n<$A>  Impressive\n\n<$B>  Yeah for starting right so\n Who knows maybe I won't work at the cadet camp next summer maybe\n\nI'll be    coaching   somewhere\n\n<$A>  Maybe\n That might be good for you\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n Actually you know that job was like the best thing to do for the\n\ncourse I'm going into\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  Cos it totally\n I still don't ah shit\n\n<$A>  What\n\n<$B>  Whenever I talk to you I always remember about my canoeing\n\ncourse and that I haven't received anything saying that I passed it and I\n\nneed it\n Like I'd really like to have something to say I passed my first\n\nlike my canoe instructor\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  have to get\n\na hold of someone down there,\n Anyways uhm because totally like everyone in my class, either\n\nlike, worked with handicapped

\n\n<$B>  It\'s part of the, background so\n\n<$A>  Well I heard from someone if you don\'t cite Freud in your P H\n\nD thesis  you\'re in big trouble   in psychology  \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  It just is\n

that    the   theme that you and I have\n\nbounced around off and on for years is this issue of, you know what does\n\nit mean to be\n undifferentiated\n you know\n\nthat  , without necessarily measuring clarity a lot of measures\n\n<,> do measure it   \n\nindirectly   in the sense that, uh people, they may me\n\nmeasuring in that people you know who   ,\n\nwho don\'t strongly endorse

right\n\n\n  of   general discussion    of the   range of uh\n you know\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  That would be nice\n\n<$B>  Yup\n And it\'s kind of implicit,\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n\n and    but   here we have a real measure of the actual\n\nthing now\n\n<$B> \n Ya,\n Why is it uh construct validity thing that it correlates with\n\nneuroticism\n\n<$A>  does the measure\n\nalso tap into things that it    does it relate to things\n\nthat should be related to conceptually  \n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$A>  So neuroticism\n I said neuroticism or lability of mood, because neuroticism is\n\n<,> lability of mood in that kind fluctuatingness\n\n<$B> \n and uhm\n\n including ah you know\n\n<$A> \n\n\nof mood then \n\n<$B> \n\nthat   at a level of construct validity\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Ya someone can say, I\'m moody,\n\n<$A>  Right and I\'m damn sure of it\n\n\n<$B>  I\'m\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>    and I know it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\nan abstract level\n\n<$A> \n and\n\nscratch the other\n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A>  I mean that\'s what she found but I mean\n\n<,,>\n\n<$B>  You see mhh\n\n<$A> \n The problem is that she provides a rationale for why they might be\n\n<,,> but I\'m not here you know\n she says it\'s for the\n\nconstruct validity because she presents, some kind of rationale\n\n<$B> \n Then you\'d need like a little stem in there that would say you\n\nknow, in support of the measures construct validity blah blah \n\nindividuals low in self-clarity report reduced awareness of thoughts and\n\nfeelings, and   uhm \n\n<$A>  And then in a separate\n\nsentence   they also report uh greater neuroticism which is thought\n\nto be a part of    low   clarity   because\n\ndah dah dah \n\n<$B>  Dot dot dot\n\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  And that\'s what you\'d need\n\n<$A>  Right\n I include it it needs the\n\nrationale\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n<$A>  Otherwise take it out\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n<$A>  Okay,\n I\'ll see what her rationale is and see how I can\n If it adds I\'ll definitely put it in\n If it doesn\'t then you know\n\n<$B>  Ya,\n that is not tied to any one\n\nparticular trait  that\'s a little colloquial\n\n<$A>  Ya how do you\n\n\n<$B> \n\none particular \n\n<$A> ,\n As I try to get away from talking too abstractly and too jargony\n\nthen I sometimes go to the other extreme which is to be too\n You know it\'s hard to get that middle, road\n\n<$B>  Ya, ya\n Uh, this is uh\n I\'m so pleased\n is fun\n\n<$A>  Oh I\'m glad,\n Well I really enjoyed it\n Like I\'ve, been having a blast doing it\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  that\'s great,\n Mhh,\n the "\n\naccuracy   of

Right\n The one place I use it,\n\n\n<$B>  still\n\n\nit\'s   dangerous   \n\n<$A> \n Okay\n\n<$B>  It\'s touching on all,\n priority may not correspond\n\nto to accurate appraisals  you know it\'s just that  there may\n\nbe motivational \n accuracy against motivation\n\n<$A> \n So just take the " accurate " out,\n Is that what you mean\n Get rid of the word " accuarte " or even cut all\n\n" motivation "\n\n<$B>  I would just, cut " accuracy " totally\n\n  and just say  look you know, as you said it\'s a hypothesis or\n\na belief\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\nand the two may be different\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  You know you might have uhm uhm,\n Mhh interesting\n,\n Right,\n Uh exactly\n in essence judgments of self-concept clarity reflect an\n\nabstract belief or hypothesis about  the stuff  that may not readily\n\nbe supported by one\'s own experiences \n\n<$A>  That\'s good enough\n\n<$B>  Ya\n think so\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  And, uhm\n\n<$A>  It suggests that there may be a motivational component, to\n\njudgments of self-clarity, or,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  bring in that motivation thing\n\n \n\n<$B> \n as\n\nif you need, to,\n\n<$A>  Right and you don\'t have to\n\n<$B>  You don\'t have to\n\n<$A> \n\nmotivated\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A> \n Okay\n\n<$B>  It\'s the two are all, interconnected\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B>  So, basically you\'ve raised the question, that well you\n\nknow, uhh, actual experience are not linked to global judgments\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B>  Global judgments, are just that\n\n\n<$A> \n\nword </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n not be tied to the\n\nperson\'s

\n\n<$B>  So it\'s just one of many things\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B>  Because you see even, the selective review, business\n\ncomes in\n Like you could do like uhm Kunda\'s, motivated reasoning

not, uhm\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  I mean there is a research grant competition for collecting\n\ndata and for everything else and   <unclear> word </unclear> you've got\n\n   that stuff  \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> , get\n\nah, ah something    that's   quick  \n\nand uh  proper and state of the art and publishable right\n\n<$A> \n Right\n\n<$B>  So you lay out your problem in the introduction,\n You got your literature review\n\n<$A>  Mh hmm,\n\n<$B>  Right\n And the literature review you, try to make it a synthesis right\n uh the De\n\nRosa that you can refer to and then there's the complicated ways of    working   at it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  aren't a lot of\n\nempirical duration models out there\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  paper\n\n  , that   I'm working on, that    you've   got there,   uhm  \n\n with    Jay

 pretty simple though\n\nactually\n hedge ratio is based\n\nsimply on price changes relative to price changes in the ten-year treasury\n\nand then it's, a percentage of the duration of the ten-year treasury\n\n<$B>  Mh hmm\n\n<$A>  Ya\n It's simpler than the De Rosa\n very easy to calculate\n It might be worth throwing in you know, as an extra,\n\nduration comparison again so we might have a <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$B>  Do you get the Journal of Fixed Income, where you work\n\n<$A>  Uhm, we do but we don't\n Uh for some reason some of the issues have disappeared and that\n\none, you told me about actually has disappeared\n\n\n<$B> \n\n paper by  Dublusky      , or  \n\n D Breeden's paper\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  ninety-five\n\n , December ninety-four  \n Sorry\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n Ya\n you\n\n  you   had emailed me\n\n\n<$B>  you haven't gone through it yet\n\n<$A>  I haven't gone through that one no\n\n<$B>  Hold on,\n I've got it here,\n dig it out\n So one of the things and\n Uhm, what's clear from that paper, is that, right, if\n\nyou try to measure duration if I can find it  ,  it's not very\n\nstable,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  do it\n\n  look at it   from ah, a one factor model\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  uses a very simple\n\napproach, just saying well let's, regress, the, percentage of\n\nthe prices on the Ginny Mae's  or on the Fanny Mae's \n\n\n, focus on when you said you

to\n\nten percent basically\n\n\n<$B> ,\n So he looks at it from a number of different, perspectives,\n\nuhh across the, empirical durations\n Exhibit twenty-five where's that\n all very,\n\nunstable  ,  and, uh    one \n\n of the things that he finds here is well    ah\n\nif you throw in a two factor model  , right you get a better fit\n\n<$A> \n Mh hmm\n\n<$B> \n\n , that   I think you should

have\n\ntwo weeks to do, you know whatever\n and\n\nsee if it's better two weeks off or maybe three days, get you some stuff\n\nand get some feedback to you and then another three days later on, uh\n\nthings like that\n\n<$B>  for graduation is\n\nwhen\n\n<$A> \n Uhm I've missed the application deadline\n ya\n\nto me     it's not important    which \n\n graduation date it is, uhm   cos    taxwise\n\n     I'm   better off ,  but I would definitely like to have it   \n\nfinished   you know like, before, you know the\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  that's what you're going to\n\ntry to finish by\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  perfect by me, and even\n\nsooner if it's, easier\n But uhm\n\n<$B>  So you've got your lit review\n what\n your, methodology\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  You're going to lay out methodolgy and data,\n The data, and then results\n Five the results\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  something outperforms\n Your, new empirical duration model works better\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  new empirical duration model with all\n\nthe complications on it works worse\n\n\n  data\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n uhm \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n  well   the preliminary one said it worked better so\n\n\n\n<$B>  It comes down to\n it comes down to it\n\n\ncorrect  , right \n\n<$A>  Ya okay\n would be sort of\n\nstandard for adjusting hedge ratios and things like that\n Like I'm using weekly data\n The Salomon, data I have is weekly,\n Uhm is there any reason I shouldn't adjust the hedge ratios weekly\n\n<,,>\n\n<$B>  Well that's the question\n Are you looking at hedge ratios or are you looking at duration\n\nthat's the basis of the hedge ratio\n\n<$A>  Or sorry\n saying okay the\n\nduration say it's four years I take    or the uh treasury duration   I hedge,\n\nappropriately to either, targeted duration or to neutralize my duration\n\nrisk\n Uhm the next week, say instead of the duration being four years\n\nit's three point eight do I readjust my, treasury's hedge or do I just\n\ncarry it to a specific horizon,\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n<$A>  I\n\nmean      and    \n\n then   it\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  it's\n\nexpensive\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  do in\n\nthis paper is we say    here's   the\n\nduration,   , whatever it is  \n\n\nfixed on this trading strategy\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\ngonna   going to   be worth your while   I don't think\n\nto go every  day\n\n<$A>  Right,\n\n\n<$B>  And it's just a question of\n holding period in most\n\nof these studies is a week, right\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n\n so that   would work, just fine because uh we get new duration\n\nestimates each week, uhm from the Salomon\n Uhm some of the other stuff is monthly, unfortunately\n going to see if I can get some uh\n\n weekly, duration estimates from uhm uh Morgan Stanley when I go\n\ndown there maybe even Salomon,\n Uh but I'm, betting on weekly being about the best I can get\n\n\nRATS , uh ready to run stuff\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  months\n\nworking on data so\n far as ahm, sort\n\nof latitude    of   empirical duration should I just\n\nstick with De Rosa and maybe one other empirical duration measure and then\n\ncompare it with, my three or four, Wall Street duration estimates \n\n and then <unclear> a few words </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\n got Wall Street   duration estimates\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  that's the thing is that Breeden's also\n\ngot these new comparisons right with   , some  \n\nempirical models\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  is, uhm,\n and, a\n\nparsimonious way, of, approaching the problem, would be to    refine      the   De\n\nRosa and I thought    that   was what the strategy\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Right\n definitely\n\n\n<$B> \n Ya if you get the Wall Street estimates right he's done it,\n\nalready\n\n\n<,> some    value these  forecasts but at the\n\nsame time, right what goes into these things, is, right survival\n\ncurves uhm, the P S A,\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Right\n So it's a lot of, uh assumptions about lifetime prepayment\n\nrates  , that  are\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n assumptions here and uh, you need ah a heck of a lot of information\n\n<,,> here to develop, just this one part  ,  of, uh,\n\nthe broker's approach, to getting the final number   ,\n\nof   the duration\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  because\n\nright \n\n<$A>  already\n\n  got their duration\n was thinking of just you know using\n\nthat as their   black box \n\n<$B> \n\nbenchmar    benchmark     as one of the benchmarks\n\n     with the   De Rosa\n\nand that would be I think very good\n\n<$A> \n Okay\n think it's a good\n\nidea then to sort of go the way    you've   done\n\n<,> on yours  \n\n which is   just uh doing a splining, finding of the uhm price\n\nyield,   ratio which \n\n<$B>  did it\n\n\nand we can say    what's   the point of doing it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  to do is that it\n\nmakes some sense although the\n\n\nJayman , that just came out\n used to be a teacher of mine, at the\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania many years ago uhm    a  \n\nreally great econometrician but sort of, he

see well when I'm talking about cutting by fifty percent\n\nyour projections that's based on projections from zero\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B> \n In your case you have some actual numbers\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B>  no point in\n\ncutting it in half because    you   uh already got\n\n<,> present clients\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  is very\n\nvery  realistic\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B> \n\nwhat is the the    because   again you're limited by\n\n   you know   facilities and so on and   how\n\nmany  you can handle per day\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  income\n\nstatements  and then maybe year three we would take on another therapist\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  two or three words\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$A>  person doing the massage\n\n<$B>  you're\n\nlimited by X amount of hours a day\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  your point is to see like you know what\n\nwould be   your saturation level  when would you anticipate on\n\nhitting that level so that you can start projecting for that, <unclear>\n\nword </unclear> extra therapist other resources whatever\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Right,\n Okay,\n So that's alright that I did it, six months at a time\n\n<$B>  Yeah that's perfect\n\n<$A>  Just so that, okay it is an academic exercise but the\n\nreason why I took the course, was to help me learn how to run a business\n\nand he started his business in October\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm right\n\n<$A>  so I\n\nthought okay this is my opportunity to do the actual research and comparisons\n\nand   come up with \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  there's a proper\n\nenvironment to it which means that   <unclear> three words </unclear>\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n  fake it and pretend that the business doesn't exist yet\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  I wasn't sure if it was, really considered a startup but I\n\nspoke to  Laura  and she said it's only three months old it's a\n\nstartup business anyway\n\n<$B>  It's a startup anyway because basically uhh I mean what\n\nyou're looking at here is taking it    off   in a\n\nnew direction\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B>  as it was\n\nin the past you actually really restarted\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  So we're fulfilling that requirement\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A> \n take into\n\naccount his education, the costs or that's just a  sump  cost that\n\nwas done like a year ago,\n\n<$B>  to get the uh\n\ncertification all that type of stuff\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mm hmm,\n\n<$B> , That was done prior to the business\n\n<$A>  Prior to October\n\n<$B> , And the business wasn't registered until uh October\n\n<$A>  Didn't register it till, February\n\n<$B>  February ahh\n And that is carried back within a year and then it would depend on\n\nyour fiscal year\n If you're\n\n<$A>  A fiscal year now has to be a calendar year, to move on\n\n<$B>  Oh it is eh\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  Oh cos see you used to be able to set your own fiscal\n\n<$A>  Yeah they changed that this year\n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n\n Say like for example if you didn't register a business, uh till\n\nOctober and and you'd done some activity in June you could actually carry it\n\nback as part of the business so    you'd   be in\n\nthat\n have to\n\n  occur in sequence\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  carry back\n\n\nthe   the   new restrictions on the fiscal, year    I can't really   say\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  cost but in actuality it's\n\npart of doing the business\n\n\nhadda   had to   put out for\n\n<$A>  Well maybe I should put it in startup costs and uh have it\n\nasterisked  as it's something that's already out\n\nof pocket\n\n<$B> \n\n  you have to   also project for it to be ongoing because you\n\nknow there are upgrades and  , courses and  learning new\n\ntechniques and so on and so forth\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  So that should be part of your budget, each year, cos\n\nthat's <unclear> two words </unclear> for training and and so on,\n\n<$A>  Alright,\n\n<$B>", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

at\n\n<,> splining and it's sort of the, first sort of critical, paper or,\n\ncritical chapter saying that well, splining   ,\n\ndoesn't   always give you the results that you want   or \n\n  that   are the correct results\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Uhm, so, well you want to talk about the shortcomings\n\nof everything huh but you could, refer,   , to\n\n  this, as, uhm some new work, that's going the opposite\n\ndirection\n you're not\n\n<,,>    going to   have   uh, you're\n\nnot going to get    the   correct results \n\n, in, uh\n\n\nerrors you're going to be, uh, accepting the, null hypothesis when\n\nit's false\n\n<$A>  Mh hmm\n\n<$B>  we should\n\ntake a look at this but at the same time uh, how, \n you done the splining too\n approach that we took\n\nyet or\n what is it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Uh, I mean we could try, doing what\n\n\n<$A> \n\nthere's there's there's   there's   a lot of different\n\npermutations we can do on De Rosa\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  I\n\nguess that's   sort of    the most  \n\nimportant uh part   or for me  is that the \n\n contribution the empirical duration, uhm coming up with a way of\n\nrefining the De Rosa\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  you know the rolling regression\n\nis one way which, makes a lot of sense to me\n Uh but that's really I guess just a testing, issue\n\n<$B>  have\n\nsome problems  , but  at the same time, nobody's looked at\n\n   the   potential problems of splining with this\n\nparticular problem\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B> \n\nother, discussion the other possible approach is    the\n\n  two factor discussion the two factor price elasticities, which\n\nhe shows that well what you    have got to   do\n\nis add up, the coefficients\n\n\n  better   numbers  , or  more\n\nreasonable numbers, uhm, than if you just go for a,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  says well look at the\n\nsensitivities relative to a short-term  Euro  as well as a long-term\n\n ,  bond\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B>  there's two sensitivities there\n\n\n  versus   your ordinary way of measuring\n\n<,,>   uhm \n\n<$A>  makes a lot of sense too\n Ya I like that cos like, you said you really notice a big\n\ndifference when the  yield  curve is flattening and the ten year is\n\nrallying but short rates aren't and if you compare duration with\n Cos all of these durations are based on, parallel moves and\n\nthat,   is never the case \n\n<$B>  - parallel interest, curve\n\nshifts and uh\n So that's the story,\n\n\n<$A> ,\n a\n\n   a   good path to build on that though\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  presuming that obviously\n\nI can't,   uhh \n\n<$B>  you can say the these are the fits that\n\nyou're getting\n\n\n go   with the two factor model     ,\n\nas    opposed to   ,\n\n\n you're   going for a two factor right what, the heck   , is   the duration\n really\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  standard\n\nduration D P over P, is, alpha plus, beta times the D I sort of\n\nthing   the interest  rate\n\n<$A> \n\n\n  <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B>  just one interest rate\n got two interest rates we can say well\n\nthis is the duration, it's the coefficient of D I is the duration\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  got two of these things\n\n\nduration, right\n Is it a linear combination and what kind of a linear combination\n\n<$A>  Right,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  trying to\n\ninterpret uhm,\n\n<$B>  well you've got a really clean way\n\nto interpret it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  as\n\n  the average interest rate change\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B>  Right\n\n\n average of that and that\n\n<$A>  Mh hmm,\n But ya okay\n\n<$B>  But it's not that same\n It's not the same,\n\n<$A>  Hmm\n Okay,\n\n<$B>  So that's the strategy, right\n lay it out and you organize\n organize it and, you sit down\n\nand you do nothing else,\n\n\n, right , uhm keep me informed sort of, every couple of\n\ndays    where   it's at\n\n<$A> \n Right okay,\n Uhm okay\n do\n\nthen is draw up a battle plan of the amount of time I can spend    or   when I can get the time the two weeks\n\n\n<$B>  I mean this is the story\n plan or no\n\nbattle plan I    want to   see kind of a\n\nintroduction and literature review  , one  week from today\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n Uhm actually I can even probably spend the weekend, doing this\n\nuhm cos I've got most of the papers uhm\n\n<$B>  And that'll put it together\n So you get all the papers together,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  to\n\nhere, and sort of, get that phase done\n the deadline one week\n\nfrom today\n\n<$A>  Okay\n I'll try and make it a little shorter uh or, sooner even, if\n\nI can\n So probably the two weeks off would be or the two weeks I could do\n\nit, uhm    since I'll be in New York\n\n<,> starting Thursday it'll   probably    be \n\n the following Monday,\n,\n\n   or   I might get \n\n<$B>  do\n do\n\nregardless\n you're going to set up the total\n\nbattle

uh from a nationalist standpoint or\n\nsomething\n\n<$A> \n\n\n, and  he wrote history the way it should have happened in his view\n\n   not   the way it did happen and    it's   not very good\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  problems is\n\nthat, everybody who studies Riel, sees a different person\n And what happens is, you know people have their own agendas\n\n ,  uh and so they want to see Riel as, what they want to\n\nsee\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<,,>  whose view was that the French and the Métis everybody else\n\nhad no right to be in the West, then   \n\nobviously Riel was a villain  \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And uh so one of the first ones they get is The Man Who Had\n\nto Hang   ,  and it comes out\n\n   uh  in that   history Louis Riel\n\nhangs Scott because Scott had won the heart of a woman that Riel loved\n which is pure nonsense\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  No such thing ever happened uhm\n\n<$B>  Ah uh that's funny\n uh that's actually mentioned in\n\n    ,   this    book that I\n\nhad    the   little green one from ah an unknown\n\nauthor\n\n<$A> \n That's probably the one\n\n<$B>  Ya it's\n\n<$A>  By Osler\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n<$A>  Ya you get that\n You get\n Uhm generally speaking, English-speaking Protestants saw him\n\nas a villain cos he's  expanding  <unclear> word </unclear> Canada's\n\nwestward plans in making the West English and Protestant so he's a villain\n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$A>  Ehm among the French Quebecois he becomes a hero\n the peculiar thing is, they\n\ndid not consider him a hero in eighteen seventy\n They didn't consider him a hero in eighteen eighty-five,\n\n<$B>  he\n\n  he   got a lot of support from Quebec\n\n<$A>  right away\n Nobody goes out to help him\n There's no speeches in the House of Commons for him\n There's no rallies,\n they come over to Riel\n And you know\n lately Quebec\n\nnationalists talk about how Quebec was always attached to him how he was\n\nfighting to build a French nation on the Plains\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  not fighting to do any such thing\n\n<$B>  No\n\n<$A>  French Quebec would have been as big an enemy to him as\n\nEnglish Ontario\n But, he gets translated into this guy,\n\n\n  the moment of translation   comes not in, eighteen\n\neighty-five it's eighteen eighty-seven,\n In eighteen eighty-seven the court hangs him\n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$A>  And the reason they hang him, is not because, he was a\n\nrebel,\n\n\n  Catholic     French-speaking\n\nCatholic  \n In the view of English Canada, this was a warning to French\n\nQuebec to stay in its place\n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$A> ,\n\n and embraces him\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  That's when you have rallies in Montreal and you have Laurier\n\n<,> saying you know  if I had been, on the Plains I would have\n\nshouldered a musket to fight with Louis Riel \n Well nothing was stopping him from doing it\n He didn't do it\n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$A>  It's eighteen eighty-seven, with the execution,\n Uh and then you get, westerners most of them the decendents of\n\nthe English Protestants who hated Riel, they suddenly in the last thirty\n\nyears began to see him as a hero, because they hate the East and he's the\n\nsymbol   of Westerns who \n\n<$B>  off by the railroad\n\nand   everything \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Ya,\n\n<$A>  And then, he gets picked up by, the unions, because\n\nthey see him as the symbol of the working man struggling against big business\n He wasn't a unionized working man\n nor was he particularly\n\ninterested in big business one way or the other\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  They all invent this hero\n He becomes a hero to the Indians, cos they perceive him as the\n\nnative, fighting against\n as\n\n<,,> as   by   Natives and M&egrave;tis generally as the man\n\nwho was fighting for them,\n And they perhaps are a little bit closer to the truth\n\n\n<$B>  Mhh\n have a certain\n\nresonance    with them   you know like  \n\n<unclear> maybe two words </unclear> \n\n<$A>  hero or the all-purpose\n\nvillain depending on where you're starting, and that's what makes him such\n\na central figure in Canadian history\n But what gets lost, is precisely what you're doing, what\n\nwas it that   Riel was asking \n\n<$B>", 'subdomain':

blast\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$C>  Today we were scientists\n\n<$A>  How was the birdwatching unit\n\n<$C>  Oh great\n We did an experiment today,\n And uh, I was teaching them how ducks are waterproof and,\n\nthey don't get wet\n Ducks Don't Get\n\nWet,\n And there's a little experiment, in the book\n\n<$F> \n\n<$C>  gree\n\n   green   ah, pff blue, water with, yellow\n\nwater\n And I told them I said, what do you think will happen if I,\n\nblend these two together\n Will they mix\n Will I get like, blue, and yellow and they're like no you'll\n\nget green you silly \n\n<$C>  silly but they were looking at\n\nme as if I'm stupid \n\n<$C>  So we did that I said okay our predictions were good and I\n\nwas telling them that scientists make predictions and,\n So I said well here I have, another bottle, of water and\n\nthey said put red red so I, put in red dye,\n And then uhm, I had oil,\n I said this is oil\n we all like\n\n  we all like   greasy hands and, I said do you think the\n\nwater and the oil will mix\n Oh yes yes yes\n I said you sure like, you won't get water and then a strip of\n\n<,> oil and\n a prediction sheet and\n\nI ticked off we said yes they all said yes \n And then, I said nobody's saying no you know\n So I didn't put my no I just left it like that,\n And then, course it, didn't mix and then I read them the\n\nbook and, they had to uh draw oh I've got it with me  I'm so\n\nproud of it \n\n<$C>  Well I photocopy everything they do in their bird journal\n\nright,\n And so they had to draw, the experiment\n Ducks don't get wet because their feathers are covered with oil\n We did a science experiment and discovered that water and oil do\n\nnot mix,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  and uh, of course I had this made up\n\n before the experiment \n And then this is my picture of our science, experiment\n cut it\n\noff\n So I had the bottle on the table and they just sat around in a\n\ncircle,\n and,\n\n<$F> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  see the journal\n\n<$A>  That's cute\n\n<$C>  Oh, uhm\n\n This is a math one that I did\n, They just had to, count and then write how many\n\n<$A>  know what\n them\n\n, with any theme\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  Yeah\n Oh\n Yeah\n And then, oh yes,\n If I could be, a bird I would be a,\n He said a blue jay and\n He told me\n He didn't feel like writing it down so I tried but, he told me\n\nbecause I like

saying that, just how quickly you dismiss it depends on\n\nwho you are,\n So that's the kind of a problem that you have to face\n And what I've suggested is that you look at the books, the first\n\nthe most up-to-date scholarship,    uh because \n\n, the up-to-date stuff,    most of it\n\nhas   included the earlier stuff so there's no point  ,\n\nreinventing  the wheel\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nof   Louis Riel because you don't really, you know learn much of\n\nthis guy\n his\n\nevidence and what he thought\n We just have tangled bits, conversations remembered by other\n\npeople and

Louis David Riel Prophet of the New World by Flanagan\n Flanagan is the most contentious one who argues the case of Louis\n\nRiel,\n Uh George uh Stanley I have down because he is the standard\n\n\n  the     basic one \n\n$B> ,\n\n<$A>  Ya\n probably a reference to Maggie Siggins:\n\nCanadian writer and journalist  because    it's \n\n quite recent and\n uh Revolution\n Thomas Flanagan again, uh and then the Selected Poetry of Louis\n\nRiel,\n a\n\nbook of readings, by Hartwell Bowsfield,\n Oh here we are\n I include that because it's just a selection of a lot of stuff\n Now, how many sources are you normally expected to consult for\n\nthis\n\n<$B>  Uh well it's twenty to twenty-five pages, officially so\n\n<,,> uhm, I guess uh three per page\n\n\nquite a     lot of space to play with,\n\n<$A>  Well I don't look at it that way\n the only reason I\n\n \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  I'm really asking this I guess because of other people\n think that, people invent\n\na magic number of sources that you're supposed to have\n think you need to\n\nhave what you need in order to do a workmanlike\n of whatever you're doing and, what you need\n\ndepends on what there is and how much there is,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  That's quite a bit\n\n<$A> \n\n not just of    Riel but\n\n Hello,\n Ya,\n Still going,\n No,\n\n need a general\n\nimpression of his world the attitudes of other people, to put it in the\n\ncontext to see    what   he's working in\n And then you have to have a range of opinion of Riel\n\n\nessentially that Riel was what he calls a  near-great ,\n That is a person who, becomes famous, a person who, comes\n\nclose to accomplishing something, but, is missing those real qualities\n\nthat take you over the top\n\n<$B>  Hmm\n\n<$A>  In short he sees him essentially as a second rate man,\n\nplaced into a first rate situation\n\n<$B>  Hmm\n\n<$A>  one two three, four, five\n\nsix seven  , that gives you a pretty solid, core to work on\n\n<,,>\n I've stayed away from stuff which deals too much\n Like The Execution of, Thomas Scott\n Well,\n\n I think you'll come across that in other stuff\n Uhm, unlike most people I don't have trouble with him\n\nexecuting Thomas Scott,\n\n<$B>  he\n\n   sounds     sounds\n\n  like he deserved it anyway\n\n<$A> \n He richly deserved it and Riel was trying to hang on to a very\n\nvolatile situation\n He was very young\n He could have lost control of the Métis at any time\n Uh, I think that executing Thomas Scott, obviously works\n\nagainst him in the long run but at the time, I could see it\n a foolish\n\ndecision\n Uhm, so if you work on those,\n do the ones I've checked off\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Now what we're doing for this\n You have, to clarify me again\n This is the preparation for the\n\n<$B>  This is the historiography ya\n\n<$A>  You're doing a course now\n\n<$B>  ah three\n\nninety-seven with  Geraldino \n the honours seminar\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  help prepare us\n\nfor    writing   the honours essay\n And beside\n some\n\nother things like uh    an analysis   of, primary documents on the Belcher\n\nIsland murders and readings and historiography\n\n<$A>  Okay so you're concentrating on, Riel's goals or as close\n\nto as you can figure out to   what on  earth they must have been\n\n<,,>\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  far as I can see he was trying to get\n\na better deal for the Métis within the Canadian Confederation,\n\n<$A>  That's what he was doing in eighteen seventy,\n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$A>  I'm not sure that's what he was trying to do in eighteen\n\neighty-five,\n And that's when you raise the whole question of his sanity when\n\nyou look at\n to\n\ndo in eighteen seventy was clearly just to get a better deal,\n But in eighteen eighty-five, he appears to have had a vision\n\nof what the West should be\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  quite the same as just getting a\n\ndeal   out of Canada \n\n<$B> , no\n\n<$A>  And in fact what he had in mind is something that would have\n\nrequired a very high degree of independence in the West\n\n\n<$B>  read\n\nthat section more closely then\n\n<$A>  Ya\n I think you have to make a distinction between\n I'm guessing\n I'm wrong and maybe\n\nwe'll find out that there's a consistency in what he was looking for\n want to prejudice\n\nthat\n going to\n\n       your   job   then\n\nfor me is to produce a paper I presume on the bibliography\n\n<$B> \n\n    uh on   the sources here ah  \n\n<$A>  And how long does this bibliography\n Is there a specified length\n\n<$B>  He,\n\n He says uh twenty to twenty-five pages\n\n<$A>  For the bibliography or the thesis\n\n<$B>  historiography\n\n<$A>  Really\n\n<$B>  Ya,\n\n\nturned it down but,    it's   up to you\n\n<$A>  Okay here's,\n would,\n He said twenty to twenty-five\n\n<$B>  Ya\n Here it is,\n\n<$A> \n\nuh  twenty   twenty, uh, and I would think that it should\n Here's what I'd like to see in it\n First, a quick outline, of the events, uh, with a\n\n<,,> suggestion of why it is, that you're studying this\n it you're looking for\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> , giving a\n\nbrief, outline of, the major differences, in the way people\n\nperceive Riel,\n Stanley has perceived him\n\nhow Flanagan et cetera\n So you find out where the areas of controversy are,\n Then, one at a time you deal with each item in your\n\nbibliography\n which\n\n gives  another  , raising criticisms   about it\n\n<,,> drawing attention to the strengths of it, and, raising questions\n\nabout it\n Are there questions it leaves unanswered\n Are there areas that you would, liked to have seen explored in\n\neach case\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  them one at a time that way,\n\n<$B> ,\n\n<$A>  Uh and I think that should do it\n\n<$B>  Okay well,\n\n<$A>  And when shall I see this\n\n<$B>  Uhm it's uh due on the twelfth\n uh wants to have it,\n of\n\n  of   April is okay\n\n\n about the twelfth\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  to mark it\n\n<unclear> about two words </unclear> \n\n<$A>  ya\n\n<$B>  Ya\n Okay, great\n come by with ah a\n\nrough draft or something just ah to make sure I'm on   the right track\n\n\n\n<$A>  before about your accent didn't I\n\n<$B>  Ya I'm from Vancouver\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Is that just Vancouver though,\n\n<$B>  Uhh I don't know\n It's, Western Canadian I guess,\n\n<$A>  Sounds a bit

uhh actually my   great  grandparents that were from the old world so  ,  not too\n\nclose\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B>  have you spent\n\n  any time over on the west coast before or\n\n<$A>  No\n What I've heard, of the accent\n so many people don't\n\ncome from there\n\n\n<$B>  new\n\n<$A>  But I know the American west coast tends to be bland and\n\nfairly close to, you know Montreal English\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> , I\n\ncan't   tell much of a difference between Californians    uh and   British Columbians\n actually a\n\nstronger accent in Washington State    than\n\n  farther south\n\n<$A>  Ya\n Uh, some things you say I would've sworn Maritimes\n\n<$B>  Mhh\n\n<$A>  and\n\nwent up at the end I thought   wow that's Nova Scotia \n\n\n\n<$B> \n Uh, that's interesting\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B> \n\naccents\n\n<$A> \n\n I was   registering a girl and, I said gee your accent has me\n\npuzzled, because   , it's   Jewish but it's\n\nnot Montreal Jewish and there's a touch of Scandinavian\n And she said well, my father's from Israel and my monther's\n\nfrom Norway    \n\n<$B>  Ahh,\n\n\n<$A>  Ya,\n Okay\n\n<$B>  Okay\n So great\n Uhm, ya I'll talk to you in about a week or so and let you

you\n\n  you   just put on a   twenty percent  for\n\ncontingencies\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  that now you see\n\n </unclear> what you forgot\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  essence you've already\n\naccounted for an

you would not,\n\nprefer to put in the business at this time, but it will be available in\n\nthe uh,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  To fall back on\n\n<$B>  Yeah mm hmm\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B> \n\nwant to   put it in right now\n\n<$A> , and the statement of\n\nassets, could I make it, April first\n\n<$B>  uhh the assets that you started\n\nright \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  Yeah and so sure your startup date can be whenever you\n\nselected  as the startup date\n April first is fine\n\n<$A>  Okay\n in the end December\n\nthirty-first\n\n<$B>  got a\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> fiscal uh  you can't go a \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  March thirty-first\n\nthen because now you're restricted\n\n<$B>  Is that just Quebec or is that a Canadian thing\n\n<$A>  I think that's\n\n<$B>  Federal or\n\n<$A>  I'll make sure\n I know it's Quebec\n\n<$B>  Yeah, because I know then that used to be the\n\nopportunities and you could  , work and create  your own fiscal\n\nyear\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  What companies can't do that in there either it's not just a\n\nquestion of startups or small business\n\n<$A>  No it's everyone\n\n<$B>  Everyone\n\n\nhave to   go to a calendar year\n Hmm\n\n<$A>  I guess there were too many little loopholes\n\n<$B>  Yeah well for sure\n\n<$A>  keep\n\ntrack  of everything\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  They have everyone with different year ends\n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$A>

should it have meaning and stuff\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  And I think the thing the most that I'm doing right now is\n\njust having fun with the idea of playing with  \n\n the   kitschiness of the

you're really getting involved in the formal aspect of the\n\nwork through    the image   that\n\ninterests you\n\n<$A>  your\n\nconcerns are really about the handling the materials the colours   you\n\nknow  <unclear> word </unclear> placings the composition\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  So in fact your concern is very formal, in the work\n\n<$B>  Yeah more formal than I would say like, thinking about

thinking that right now uhm as I've been looking\n\nat your work  ,  there's a formal issue, that you're\n\nconcerned with in the content\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  are\n\nevolving  ,  in the work\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And I was looking at these and, for example this one quite\n\ninterested me\n Self\n\nLooking In Window, uhm, and the handprints you know that are\n\nincorporated and it's very speedy   quick \n\n<$B>  yeah\n\n<$A>  Kind of an you know image\n\n\nyawning from Speaker B in the background  but I'm just uhm saying how \n\n  the technique   of\n\npainting on the plate,\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A> \n\n associate that   with  , uh, \n\n  the tradition of decorating plates   \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  That's a very, uhm, expressionistic look, as well,\n\nas uhm,    an awareness   of uh notions\n\nof identity, that come through, in the images you know\n So you know you get the uh,\n\n<$B>  The handprints\n\n<$A>  The handprints on the side, uh the notion of the idea that\n\nyou know there's not just one self but of a monster self\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  You know that and the idea of the window, you know the idea\n\nof painting being a kind of window   that you  look at the portrait\n\nand you know like actually drawing the window\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  So it's actually a very informed, image in terms of, you\n\nknow the ideas behind it\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  it may've happened intuitively in a flash\n\n but it may have come out of uhm a certain awareness\n\nand uhm,\n\n<$A>  Again, this one is uh, called Monster Break-Up Chaos\n\n<,,> and I just thought of you a lot because she, uses these very, you\n\nknow sort of popular culture sources  , of things \n\n<$B>  I can see that\n\n<$A>  And it depends a lot on the intensity of the surface and the\n\nmovement   so she had to make it quite interesting \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  I think it's very expressionistic\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  And very movement and,\n\n<$A>  So when I look at the uh image, of the owl, okay, uhm\n\n<,> what would make me think, in your drawing, that it's a memory,\n\n<$A>  What clue visually have you given me to make me know it's a\n\nmemory,\n problem for\n\nyou in your, next work\n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$A>  Like since these works are about evoking memory\n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$A>  Uh, how can you, evoke like visually the idea that this\n\nis a memory\n Like, how would I know it's not uhm you know uh something that\n\nyou've seen that you reproduced\n\n<$B>  Right right\n\n<$A>  Do you know what I mean\n\n<$B>  Okay\n\n<$A>  In other words how do I know it's a reference and not,\n\nsomething you're uhm,\n\n<$B>  Paying homage to in a sense\n\n<$A>  Yeah that's it\n\n<$B>  Okay okay\n\n<$A>  of uh,\n\nwhat it's about\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  You know and if I look at this guy's work here in this uhm\n\nartist uhm, Jacob Lawrence\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  paintings\n\n  that tell of the Black Exodus you know the migrations from the\n\nSouth to the North in the United States\n And you know like the way he framed it okay, the size, each\n\none's the same size\n They're twelve by eighteen inches you know\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  tells you\n\nlike it's modest it's not supposed to knock you over\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  It's a very modest size\n And then, the text tells us\n Like one thing that you know, it's not just a, painting of\n\nbuildings\n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$A>  Is you know he informs us\n\n<$A>  Uhm, here it is uhm,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  they're not\n\nthey're   they're    certain kind\n\nof colours\n The painting has a certain illumination\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  It's simplified uhm it's modest, in appearance\n\n<$A>  given a look of\n\nslickness   and uh  it's given a certain look that's fixed in his\n\nphilosophy\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  there's\n\nsomething   humble and touching about it\n And then in an awkward, like uhm, very, schematic look uh\n\nso that it's easily understood but also like it's very touching you know and\n\nit promotes certain values\n So just through the look, you get an idea of what the artist's\n\nvalues are\n\n<$A>  And that's what I'm questioning you\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  I get\n\n  an idea from the look  ,  of those marks\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$A> \n\n values around artmaking\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  And I like found it interesting to look at these two artists\n\nbecause, they're both aligning themselves with values visually\n\n<$A>  The values are being expressed in a visual way that are\n\nalmost uhm anti-establishment this\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  Just without actually saying it I mean in this case he's\n\nobviously you know accounting, the history of the Black Exodus\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A> \n\n you know \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  That comes from uh first of all the notion of story telling\n\nor telling the history of the didactic where like all this is very, uhm\n\ncontrary to\n You know he's painting at the same time as Jackson Pollock I mean\n\nit was, the, antithesis of internationalist abstraction and so\n And very consciously so\n And yet he also uses you know sort of cartoon-like well not\n\ncartoon but very, schematic, kinds of images\n And yet the compositions are very beautiful and, really thought\n\nout uh you know like the choice of this yellow over here and just you know\n\nthis very sombre unpretentious kind of mark, is very important,\n that\n\nsays \n So you know he's using this uhm\n\n<$B>  Did these quotes come with the paintings then\n\n<$A>  with the paintings\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Uh they're placed next to them\n But his compositions are really incredible you know like the\n\nlittle bits of colour and\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  you're in the\n\npresence of something that's the common people\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  And you get that not just cos the subject matter but through\n\nthe way he lays paint down, the way you know the uh flat cut-out approach\n\nyou know   he's aligning himself with a certain  cultural identity\n\nand you know painting them in this way\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  So that's why I'm thinking about,\n Since they're about memory and you're trying to recall certain\n\nnostalgia  ,  it sounds like what you're describing\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Now how could you, start to uh communicate that aspect a\n\nbit more\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  uhm maybe you could disrupt some of the\n\ninformation   you know like the words \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yeah that's another thing I was thinking of doing\n\n<$A>  You know like letting things, be fragmented a bit more\n\nbecause like memory one of the things that characterizes memory is that it's\n\nnot exactly like something happening in the moment\n\n<$B>  Yeah it's always blocks and pieces and trying to put it\n\ntogether\n\n<$A>  Yeah and so formally like you've given me, everything is\n\nin equal detail\n very much like it's\n\nmemory\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  Uhm and there's nothing in the text to tell me that it's\n\nmemory\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  I mean that's more factual than the text\n\n<$A>  something to\n\nconsider \n\n<$B>  in a sense, like there\n\nis the nostalgia feel with like   empty words  like hypnovision and\n\nthe mystic terror of the owl or whatever\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '23bf276a-54de-48d3-9649-5baa2d3aec4f', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:50.712527+00:00',

\n\n<$A>  Mhh hmm\n\n\n<$B>  So\n So that's not going to take me more than\n say a day so it'll probably be\n\nlike two or three     you know but\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  this and the comps and uh\n\n<$A> \n

are\n\nunconstitutional \n Here we are\n Choquette by the way\n\nJér&ocircumflex;me Choquette\n Remember him\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  if he was related\n Uh said this law is unconstitutional and has to be replaced and\n\nbasically what we have is the  Union Nationale  led by Maurice\n\nDuplessis taking away power over the family, uh from the federal\n\ngovernment  , and  that's where you can see what's going to\n\nhappen\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Because uh it starts off as kind of a shouting match between\n\nuh Duplessis and King who was Prime Minister at the time  , \n\nover who has the rights over the

have\n\n  expired  as soon as  <unclear> word </unclear> in jail \n\n<$A> \n Ya,\n\n<$B>  or whatever\n\n \n\n<$A> , very interesting\n This starts uhh in February and in earnest,\n Uh and it's a full page ad\n\n\nactually   hard to copy into our ad cos it's so huge\n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$A>  It's this thing called a Federation of Charity\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  sort of the first ad that comes up\n\nand it's about this guy uhm uhm this Honourable Maurice Trudeau  ,\n\n uh who said that he saw you know poverty and families abandon children\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Uh you know, uh people being uh uhm uh\n chi\n\n   children       poor children  \n\n   , in things   abandonment\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  uh you know nurseries uh I\n\nsaw uh poor babies you know sick    and   all these\n\nterrible things\n And what he keeps promising\n\n\n<,,>  and   all these different things\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n this federation is going to   put money towards, fixing these\n\nthings\n here\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  where\n\n you see poor children  , being  fed you know kind of\n\nlike uh babies and mass\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  two\n\nwords </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n So this guy is claiming that he's going to uhm, uh uhh help\n And you can help\n And this is\n They want\n we need this\n\nmuch money   okay \n\n<$B>  ya\n\n<$A>  And uh\n\n<$B>  not associated\n\nwith the Catholic Church\n\n<$A>  No, no\n This is\n what\n\nthis guy is\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n  comes     like the next day\n and the things\n\n   that   they need the money for\n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A>  explaining, what all this\n\nmoney is going to be used for\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  the families uh medical to home\n\nplacement of children which sort of uhm   relevant to  our, uh\n\nstudy uh special diets uh development of existing, things uhm, uh you\n\nknow all kinds of social services\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  it's almost like, uh we don't need\n\nthe federal government\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  system\n\ncos it's definitely not with the Church\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Uhm, we have here the members of the committee, of this\n\n  budget \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  So we have the names here\n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$A>  basically,\n\ncharity for    French Canadians  \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  they're saying, we're going to\n\ncreate our own  , social  system\n secular privatized\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  That's important because up to now there's been a Protestant\n\n<,,> English, - language system, for charity and there's been    a   Catholic Church run system, and so this is really uh\n\n ,  quite remarkable  \n\n<$A> \n\n\n   a couple days later you get this one, which is actually\n\nthe picture, <unclear> word </unclear> from that\n This is the picture which I thought is just so\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n Look at it\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n and   destitution \n\n<$B> \n\ncoming\n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A> \n\nFrench\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  in the English papers\n\n<$A>  No, they don't talk about it\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nthis   alternate, uh social system  ,  and it's the\n\nFrench, taking care of the French\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  you know really acting like they\n\nare   a nation, within   a nation \n\n<$C> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  stuff\n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n<$C> \n\nabout because  they don't talk about\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  mhh hmm\n\n<$A>  saying we've got to\n\ntake care of our own    you know and we need your money  \n\n<$C> \n\n<$A> \n\n  they never do get   all the money that they\n\nneeded\n\n<$B> \n it\n\nsounds like they   had some grand schemes but   \n\ndid   any of it come   to pass \n\n<$A>  out\n There's just nothing\n,\n Uh when was that\n Uh February,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  there's dates on some of them\n Uhm\n\n<$B>  Yes February forty-five\n\n<$A>  Okay\n it just\n\nsort of peters out\n, pan out\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n of the ads get smaller\n\nand smaller  as the  amount\n down to\n\nthings like this,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And uh, I'm not quite sure what happens to these people\n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$A>  It just kind of stops mentioning them\n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm\n big focus on children\n\n ,  throughout the campaign\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> ,\n\n<$A>  So, they have like an alternative system that again it's\n\njust like they are, in total contempt of the federal system\n\n\nas if it's not happening\n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$A>  sounds like you know\n\nthere is no social system    in   service that\n\nthere's no social services    in   place, and\n\nthey're going to create them,   as if  the federal one isn't\n\neven in    existence  \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> ,\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  private ones\n\n<$A>  Ya\n is interesting\n This is uh, uhm a bit more about uhm educating, parents\n\n\n back to this whole idea of ah\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n we get at  Saint Henry which we've seen before\n\n<$B> \n Mhh hmm\n\n<$A>  This seems to be references

objects together like I think the\n\ndinosaur's gonna be one that has a lot   of \n\n<$A>  you see those I think are all still sort of\n\na nostalgia image that comes from the movies you know around uh fantasy\n\nanimals and\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  You know fantasy, images, that are from science fiction\n\nand things like   that \n\n<$B>  that something that was a large part of my\n\nchildhood though fantasy\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B>  grew up just,\n\nmaking up games in your head and stuff like that\n I wasn't Nintendo boy at all you know\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  And that's something I find different in the age today where\n\nall these kids are just you know video games video games T V T V T V  \n\nyou know \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  I was quite the T V fanatic and buff but, we also had you\n\nknow a free run of you know, fields and you know playing with plastic\n\ndinosaurs and creating games and stuffed animals and creating games and\n\ncharacters and you know all kinds of\n you know the\n\nstreet\n\n<$A>  So are you saying because they weren't on the screen like\n\nsomehow there's more of a human kind of personal\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  you're imagining a time that was\n\nsort of kinder or softer\n\n<$A>  Is that one of these things that you're trying to get across\n\n<$B>  Yeah I think so\n uh, uhhh\n\na lot of ,  for me I get a lot of   nostalgia feeling from\n\nit like I just you know sit back and look at it and I can remember you know\n\nbeing yay big you know looking at stuff like this and going oh my God you\n\nknow like\n I remember seeing Alfred Hitchcock's uh The Birds or whatever for\n\nthe first time and that just terrified me and now I look at it and go like\n\nohhh you know like \n\n\non   days on end   just like oh my God they're coming to get\n\nme\n I think that's something I'm trying to evoke in this too just,\n\nthe the kitschiness of you know being scared and you know the boogeyman and\n\n<,> you know stuff like that and I think the owl had like that feeling too\n\n<,> being a centrepiece in the living room you know like\n It was always there and it was always sort of like you know oooh\n\nyou know spooky and scary-looking and stuff like that\n\n<$A>  Uh huh,\n\n<$B>  In a sense that's what I'm trying to\n\naccomplish I think more in the objects\n But I can see in a sense what you're saying with you know how do\n\nyou the viewer get that and I don't know if I'm coming across, that well\n\nin conveying these messages you know like\n\n<$A>  Well that's why I was sort of thinking that if they were you\n\nknow  , like in this kind of format here  you know where you\n\nhave,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  You know in this image by Larry Rivers you know you have these\n\nfragments of things so it appears like more like stream of    ,\n\n<$B> \n Like formally he's created a space and a composition that is\n\nsomething like stream of consciousness or, could easily   apply \n\nto memory as well\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  first of all the mark,\n\nthe mark you're suggesting is very permanent\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  you know in a\n\nvery permanent looking kind of way\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  should be a little more\n\nfragmented do you think\n\n<$A>  if you handled it\n\n<,>  \n\n\n exactly how to do it \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  word\n\n</unclear>  \n\n<$A>  But if I, you know think about that like just uhh as I was\n\nsaying before about memory\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A> ,\n\n it's different\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  The image you have of something in your mind even though it's\n\nvery clear, uh is different than when you're actually going through it in\n\nthe moment\n I would say that you\n\ncould explore, things that  uh evoke that\n\naspect\n And that's why I was showing you that image because it formally\n\nsuggests, a composition that could evoke it,\n\n<$B>  I\n\ncould get \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Yeah I think what I'm missing maybe a little more in these\n\ndrawings, is maybe writing like blurbs of   memory \n\n<$A> \n\none of   it's an   artwork so what distinguishes uhm you know\n\nwriting for information and writing that's for art\n\n<$B>  Mm\n\n<$A>  You know like how would you make a distinction,\n You know like in here the writing becomes a formal part of the\n\ncomposition it has  ,  the   kind of, sort of\n\nuh you know change and variation and, nuance that the painter and  the\n\nmarks  have\n\n<$A>  them are wiped\n\nout and \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  You know there's a certain,\n\n<$B>  There is definitely the relation\n\n<$A>  marks\n\nand the handwriting\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> , So these are things to consider uhm, that might be\n\nemployed in the piece\n And again in the one of the cheese like there was a liveliness to\n\nthe marks you know    they   had more of some of\n\nthese qualities you know\n seem to have some of your,\n\nhandwriting along with the handwriting like\n\n<$B>  Yeah okay\n\n<$A>  And you know made them kind of more interesting\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  So uhm or even something like this you know where you've got\n\nthe handwriting\n There's something you know, a bit brutal about the way this is\n\nhandled so that it becomes more than sort of copying the look of a particular\n\nposter\n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$A>  You know because it's not enough, like in an artwork like\n\n<,>   you know like  we would demand  \n\nmore\n\n<$B>  being a little too formal maybe\n\n<,>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  being too formal I think\n\nthe content like I would want a little more sense of irony in it of, some\n\ncritical edge\n\n<$A> \n\n<,>  from it intellectually, or enough of an edge in the statement,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And I'm wondering how to problematize it you know so that\n\nthere's more,    of  </} content that comes through \n\n<,,>\n And I could show you some things,\n work\n\n<$B>  pause for about twenty seconds\n\n\n\n<$A>  You know so if I take an image like this which comes from a\n\nPolaroid photograph that has been you know, painted and you know not in\n\nsimilar colours to the ones you're using\n But there's uhm, you know a kind of exploration of things that\n\nare tight things that are looser you know just getting into  the play of\n\n the materials, more and    it's not \n\n just a    repeating   of the\n\nPolaroid photograph but bringing it into, sort of   orginal artwork\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B>  laugh\n\n drawing a bit of himself a self portrait\n\n<$A>  Oh yeah\n\n<$B>  the face is just going\n\ncrazy and half the face is sketched out half his face, and half of it is a\n\nphotograph but yeah the colours just change the whole thing\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  I'm just trying to\n\nfind some of the text in them ,  I had some slides with text \n\n\n Oh yeah like here you know it says pregnant you know nineteen\n\neighty-eight nineteen eighty-nine, uhm\n\n<$B>  What'd she write on the thing there\n\n<$A>  Yeah she writes, you know, uhh it's called The Cover-up\n\nyou know so the title, is ironic you know cos we can't think of the word\n\ncover-up without thinking of Nixon and\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  an\n\nintellectual content  \n like to\n\nsee more of an intellectual content, in that\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Okay\n\n<$A>  You know and formally I find that, you know things uh\n\nbeing so much the same, treatment everywhere you know I don't find it as\n\nformally interesting as the one with the cheese    in\n\nthat   sense\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  You know like all the libraries that'd be wearing this\n\n<unclear>  material  </unclear> would be all\n Like they're not exactly slick and they're not exactly awkward or\n\nexpressionistic they're sort of somewhere in between\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  And they sort of hover\n I don't know like their intention is a little uh unclear to me\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  You know we talked about that you know the handwriting maybe\n\nyou should get more like graffiti maybe it should be slicker maybe some of it\n\nshould be like graffiti and some of it should be airbrushed some of it should\n\nbe, stencilled or you know like, maybe you should do one that's just a\n\ncomposition with just the letters and see what kind of composition you can\n\nwork out with just the words\n You know a composition using words and dealing with spaces in\n\nbetween the letters and seeing what you could do with that", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source':

No you can't\n ice\n\nhockey team  do well for a short while anyway\n They beat the Devils last night at the Montreal Forum\n It doesn't get easier\n They play the Penguins in Pittsburgh tonight\n\n\nnational hockey league \n And he's got some great linemates as well\n And this will be a true test as Vincent Damphousse has said for the\n\nMontreal Canadiens\n But now that we've had a few minutes or a few hours a few days to\n\n<,> sit back and digest what has gone on here, let's look at the facts of\n\nthe Montreal Canadiens\n There are now only four players left from the team that won the\n\nStanley Cup only two and a half years ago\n Which tells you that the Canadiens were not happy with winning the\n\nStanley Cup\n Obviously most teams would be thrilled to win it even with the\n\nproblems that Montreal allegedly had at the time\n That Patrick Roy won the Stanley Cup for them\n Well it's true they got by because of Patrick Roy and the play of\n\n<,> John Leclair and ahh    a   couple of other\n\ndefensemen uh J J Daigneault one of them who played pretty well Eric\n\nDesjardins who is now in Philidelphia\n All these key players are gone\n The ones who are left are uhh Patrice Brisebois Benoi&icircumflex;t\n\nBrunet Lyle Odelein and Vincent Damphousse\n So the Canadiens have changed a lot\n now there are nine Europeans on the team including four Russians\n Don Cherry is going to have something to say about that Saturday\n\nnight when the Canadiens host the New York   Rangers \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  he's not going to be happy about it I can\n\ntell you that\n Already he's not\n\n<$A>  I mean isn't\n\nit \n\n<$B>  where some\n\nof the criticism about this trade that was made uh for Martin Rucinsky and\n\nJocelyn Thibault and Andrei Kovalenko is that Kovalenko and Rucinsky not\n\nnecassarily known for their hard nosed play\n They don't bring toughness and character to this team\n And that's exactly what the Canadiens were missing and they got rid\n\nof lot of it when they let captain Mike Keane and Patrick Roy go to the\n\nColorado Avalanche\n And, we'll hear Mario Tremblay put it all in perspective here\n\n\n\n<$A>  Well weird thing said at the end there\n was\n\n  had   so much heart and was so great for the organization\n\nand loved him so much\n\n<$B>  Offensively he wasn't producing\n But that's not the point\n The whole point dates back to the preseason when Mike Keane was\n\nnamed captain of the Montreal Canadiens\n\n\n\n uhh we don't speak French in the locker room here  \n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  just already abdicating the\n\nStanley Cup\n Give it up\n\n<$A> \n Oh well\n Other scores\n\n<$B>  Uhh other scores\n Yes we do have some uh L A Kings over Winnipeg six three Hartford\n\nbeat the Islanders seven four Tampa Bay over Anaheim two one Rangers and\n\nChicago tied at five\n The Atlanta games opening ceremonies\n They're not releasing the doves next year\n It will be a symbolic gesture\n Whatever that means\n They haven't explained what it is\n\n\n<$A>  it's unfair to doves or something\n\n<$B>  Well they're worried that they say it's cruelty to birds and\n\nanimals    and   groups are getting down on them\n I can imagine because of all the planes flying overhead during the\n\nceremonies\n\n<$A>  Welcome to the modern world\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  And that's John Hiatt with the song You

Hiatt\n\n<$A>  Returning to his classical roots\n\n<$B>  Yeah he really is\n\n\n\n<$A>  I should say classic roots\n\n<$A> \n\n \n\n<$B> \n\n    uhh does not   apply to John Hiatt\n It really is classic roots rock\n last album was a record\n\ncalled Perfectly Good Guitar which was kind of a musical departure for this\n\nrootsy singer songwriter\n Cos it featured a tougher louder uhh really guitar sound that was\n\ninspired by a new generation of grungy rockers like Nirvana and Soul Asylum\n\n\nword </unclear> it was hardly uh John Hiatt's best uh record\n Um but the latest album from this Indiana-born rocker which is\n\ncalled Walk On is really much closer to the back to basics down home sound\n\nthat's been Hiatt's trademark for a number of years\n Um, in fact this new album, is really reminiscent of the great\n\nmid-eighties albums from Hiatt\n Records like Bring the Family and Slow Turning\n Which I think most people consider to be John Hiatt's best albums\n Um and it, really goes back to that classic roots sound\n couple\n\nsort of hard rockers there as well\n\n<$A>  So what do you think\n One of his better albums this new one\n\n<$B>  I think it is actually\n I mean it's his best album probably still is Bring the Family but\n\nWalk On is a very strong album\n Um a song like You Must Go which is what we were just listening to\n\nis really the perfect example of what's great about John Hiatt\n something about the John\n\nHiatt sound\n in\n\nclassic Americana\n A real rootsy sort of some kind of southern rocking feel to it\n But it also has a contemporary feel\n I mean it's not old fashioned uhh music\n is\n\n  is   the songwriting\n The guy is just a great songwriter\n In fact that's why he's probably better known for his songs which\n\nhave been covered by everyone from Bob Dylan to Bonnie Raitt  \n\n to   even Iggy Pop\n in his early\n\nforties writes about real life adult situations\n\n\nbut   unfortunately enough    is   a\n\nsuprisingly rare thing in rock and roll where you have middle aged rockers\n\nlike Mick Jagger who are still going on about chicks and cars as if they are\n\nstill, teenagers\n Hiatt writes about real people and people we can identify with\n\n\nsixteen\n I mean his specialty is writing about relationships\n Um especially relationships gone wrong\n And as the title Walk On implies this album really is full of\n\nreferences to wandering and hitting the road\n And it really seemed to me in many ways to be a kind of mid-life\n\ncrisis album\n oh\n\nmy god this is it \n cos he did have\n\ndrinking problems and a lot of, personal problems\n the article in this\n\nmorning's Gazette  he says  no this is just\n\nwhat he's writing about but he's still happily married  which is good\n\nto hear\n Um musically it's just an incredibly rich album\n\n\nproduced records for The Tragically Hip and Keith Richards\n And he's a real good match for Hiatt because he specializes in\n\ndown home rootsy uhh guitar rock and that's what John Hiatt is all about\n\n<$A>  This is tonight at the Spectrum\n I assume with the kind of music he does he's probably pretty good\n\nin concert\n\n<$B>  Oh he's great\n\n\n and   his records are great but I mean it's not a cliché\n\nto say    that   I mean you   \n\ngot to   see this guy live\n This is, the perfect place\n out in a big\n\nway live too\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Now wait a minute here\n I was expecting Cajun derivative music and some great accordion\n\nplaying and there she is \n\n<$B> \n\n and to be brutally honest she's not the greatest singer in the world\n I actually wanted to play that track cos I think it's a different\n\nside to Danielle Martineau\n\n\n especially   on this album like she really is known    for   her Zydeco Cajun sound\n\n\n Zydeco Musico which is sort of classic Cajun\n But I wanted to show that this album it really has a kind of\n\nvariety    of   musical sounds that I think might\n\nsurprise some people    who   think it's just only\n\nstraight New Orleans style stomp\n\n<$A>  But she is in town to play\n\n\ngotta   got to   reach into the Cajun repertoire\n\n<$B>  Oh no\n Absolutely\n And again you know talking about the difference between uh uh you\n\nknow the records and live\n Live of course that sort of Cajun fiddle stomping\n She's got this great fiddle player Michael Ball in her band\n Obviously they're going to pull that kind of stuff out\n I think as the night goes on, too right and that's obviously\n\ngreat party music uhm\n She's also a very accomplished musician\n accordion player and\n\nsinger and she's really studied the accordion pretty seriously\n\n\n uh sort of played and studied under like sort of great Zydeco players\n\n<$A> \n\nquebec folk band  kind of thing\n She sort of takes those traditions and injects some new stuff into\n\nthem\n\n<$B>  I think\n\nthere's   actually a collaboration with some  \n\n of   the folks from the  bottine souriante \n she\n\ntakes some of that traditional Quebecois uh sound, mixes that with Cajun\n\nand also mixes it with uh almost rock and roll\n Tealy\n\n  téléguidés   which is a kind of\n\ncritique of the T V culture\n out and out\n\nrocker but then you have this sort of foot stomping traditional fiddle in \n\n     a   lot of   songs\n of what's really good\n\nabout it actually is Martineau's very talented band which is a band called\n\nRockabayou\n Includes as I mentioned uhm Michael Ball on fiddle who's just\n\nreally    a   dynamite uh fiddle player\n Guitarist Jason Lange who's also very accomplished musician\n And they all really come to life on stage\n That's where it's really best to uh see these guys\n I mean what's interesting is uhm you would think in a way mixing\n\ntraditional Quebecois folk music with traditional Louisiana music would be an\n\nobvious uh concept there's so many uh similarities between those types of\n\nmusic \n\n\n\n<$A>  now with traffic\n\n<$B> \n\nbe hit by a blimp\n really

\n He says uh the conflict there is one of the most unpopular labour\n\nmanagement disputes in recent memory\n And that you don't have to be anti-union to be unsympathetic with\n\nthe demands uh being made by the union there for a four day week\n He says the four day week is a good idea in theory but not\n\npractical at the casino\n Uh the workers there want to work thirty eight hours over four days\n\nbut they want forty  pay\n\n\ngonna   going to   want    if you want   a\n\nshorter work week, you have to take a cut in pay\n There's no two ways about it he says\n\n<$A>  Yeah it certainly looks in many ways as though they were\n\nprofiting from the great success of the casino that they went on strike so\n\nearly into it's life\n\n<$B>  It was an incredible boom\n They had to uh enlarge

about the necessity for a massive restructuring of the state apparatus\n\nin Quebec\n Ah he says it's important that the public sector, ah be\n\ncompletely ah reorganized\n Says in fact Quebecers want and consume more consumer goods uh than\n\never before\n That the standard of living really hasn't dropped, despite\n\nlayoffs and uh recessionary sort of glitches\n He says the problem is that, Quebecers want more luxury goods\n\n<,>\n Uh trips V C Rs home computers,\n And they also pay more taxes\n So ahm he says the problem is that there's these two dynamics at\n\nwork\n\n\n increased services from the state and we can't have all those things\n So there has to be a major restructuring of the health and uh\n\neducation uh    services  \n\n\n<$A>  That's interesting\n sort of take on\n\nthings that we haven't heard\n\n\n I guess    \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  And finally I just thought I'd leave you with a note from the\n\nGlobe and Mail that says that uh thinking uses up fifteen

three lanes open eastbound on the Trans\n\nCanada\n And soon that construction will be over so just, hold on cos\n\nthat will soon be finished\n Also watch out for fog patches coming in from outlying areas\n They are slowly burning off though\n\n<$A>  as again we've\n\ngot our video picture of the city out there\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Well that should burn off to give us a sunny day\n A high of thirty degrees\n So another lovely day much like yesterday\n And as promised another one tomorrow\n So let's hope we can deliver on that\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  's our reporter in Sweden where she\n\nwatched yesterday's big race and she joins us live\n the fastest two men in the world this year\n\nare Canadians\n They are basking in the glory right now but, I guess they don't\n\nhave a lot of time to celebrate because Bailey and Surin will be taking part\n\nin another big race later this week\n\n<$B>  That's right\n They've uh got their pictures on the front page of every Swedish\n\nnewspaper over here but already their thoughts are turning to the four by one\n\nhundred men's relay race\n Now the first round is going to be held on Saturday but even\n\nbefore then, uh Team Canada has to announce who is going to run alongside\n\nof Bruny and Donovan\n It's a four man team\n We can expect an announcement either later today or tomorrow\n because\n\n<,> Americans Dennis Mitchell and Carl Lewis are out of contention altogether\n\nwith injuries\n There was a possibility they could run\n They were favoured to win the gold but with them out it looks like\n\n<,> maybe another gold medal for Canada\n And uh still with sprinting Lynford Christie, who did not place\n\nat all in the men's one hundred metre yesterday, he has a hamstring injury\n He went down at the end of the men's one hundred metre, and\n\nwe're still waiting word on the severity of that injury\n\n<$A>  Hmm\n Now Canada of course is celebrating however Graham Hood of\n\nOakville Ontario, uh one of our top middle distance runners will not be\n\ntaking part at this year's World's\n\n<$B>  No he's disappointed and the entire Canadian team is\n\ndisappointed, because it was going to be sort of    a \n\n two-pronged thrust for Canada in the men's fifteen hundred with Graham\n\nHood and Kevin Sullivan\n But word this morning from England, where Graham has been\n\nrecovering from a hamstring injury that he suffered in an eight hundred metre\n\nrace in Sheffield earlier, it's just too severe\n He's been working with physiotherapy and light workouts, but he\n\ncan't run the race that he would like to so he has withdrawn altogether\n be Kevin\n\nSullivan, to keep an eye out for later this week\n\n<$A> \n\n decathlete Michael Smith\n\n<$B> \n After seven events Michael of Kenora has moved up, now

can imagine it was   it was  oh\n\nyeah  yeah there was just bolts    of \n\n you know colourful wools and chenille lying around and paper patterns on\n\ncutting tables and, racks and racks of fall merchandise, just waiting\n\nto be shipped out\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Now I wanted to quiz her on what we'll be seeing in stores\n\n<,> but first I had to find out what we won't be seeing\n\n<$C>  You know the grunge look has been finished\n look\n\nlike that anymore\n so bizarre\n\nbecause for a time in fashion I mean    I   did that\n\nthing too I mean I did the grunge look so I'm guilty also\n But it's so funny because you know you can spend a lot of money\n\nand you look, poor\n But this season I think it's going more towards this Hollywood\n\nglamour\n This nineteen forties uh appeal like the green coat I showed you\n\nwith the big shawl collar and the big pockets and the tabs on the pockets\n cashmere coat\n That's a spin-off of nineteen forties, where women look\n\nglamorous\n\n<$A>  Well glamorous\n From Courtney Love to Joan Crawford I guess in one year\n Now all that talk of glamour if that's back in and women are\n\nlooking more like women uh how will that translate into what we'll see in the\n\nstores\n I guess no more plaid no more baggy jeans no more scrappy sort of\n\nstuff\n But what'll be replacing them\n\n<$B>  Well we'll start with the colours for fall because we're\n\ngoing uh back to the basics it looks like\n No more baby blues or baby pinks or whatever so much\n Didn't see much in the way of the metallics either that were\n\npopular for a while\n\n\n  going to   be seeing a lot of, what Angela\n\nBucarro calls  the forest  colours\n rich\n\ngreens of the trees and the burgundies and, the chocolate brown that\n\neither you look great   in \n Earth tones exactly, rust and of course, lots of black\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  thinking I look like death in all of\n\nthose  \n\n\n<$B> \n\ngot to   find one colour there's usually one colour  \n\n or      one

{'text': "<$B>  and actually\n\nit's   true though they're colours that really make you stop and go\n\nyou know,  fall is here  you know no more  \n\n of the   brighter colours\n In terms of actual styles well there really isn't one style\n I mean I'm sure you've noticed this as\n\nwell, fashion's really changed  \n Skirts aren't all you know one length, everybody has the style\n\nthat looks good on them\n But there is one trend that we can look at uhm comfort\n\n\n going to   wear that outfit for twelve hours at work you also\n\nhave to, feel good and feel comfortable\n be you know\n\nshifting the skirt and pulling the pants down and tucking the shirt in \n\n  so   loose and flowing were some of the words that\n\nwere being used to describe this season\n\n<$A>  a radical\n\nconcept \n glad to\n\nhear that though,    that   the dictates are\n\nloosening up a bit\n I mean it used to be that sort of uh skirts ankle length one week\n\nand then thigh high the next\n pleased certainly to\n\nhear that uh more variety's what's going on out there\n That's there no one skirt length or one type of shoe\n\n<$B>  with\n\n  women themselves saying you know stop\n Enough is enough\n Women who are looking and recognising what they do and they,\n\nmore importantly do not look good in\n be\n\ncomfortable in what they wear whether they're working or whether    it's   you know for play on the weekend\n In a sense fashion has become much more, customer oriented and\n\ncustomer dictated than it was five or ten years ago\n\n<$C>  The fashion today is more uh geared to the consumer\n She is very smart, she knows exactly what she wants\n\n\nspeaker says 'bod' not 'body'  and she says well    I'm\n\n  too short to wear very wide pants\n So in my collection you'll see a series of wide pants, and\n\nyou'll see a series of narrower pants\n And as far as lengths of skirt go you'll see both\n You'll see very long at thirty-five inches, and you'll see some\n\nshort at twenty-one inches,\n I don't think you'll see much of the mini-micro,\n\n<$A>  Well we can all breathe a sigh of relief on that one\n that talk of\n\ntwenty-one inches\n That sounds pretty micro to me\n\n<$B>  Well it was funny cos I thought the same thing but it's,\n\nnot as short as I thought\n That actually falls to just barely above your knee\n quite respectable quite\n\nprofessional\n Now the other thing that's interesting is men's fashions continue\n\nto creep into women's wear\n Uhm you've probably got a few already\n how many of your husband's or\n\ndad's sweaters or jackets have been hanging in your closet over the years\n\n<$A>  I tell you I'd be right back to grunge if I tried to wear my\n\nhusband's \n I'd\n\n  be floating\n It'd be like those pants you can fit three of your friends in\n I'd look pretty ridiculous\n\n<$B>  Well now you can go out and you can buy your own husband's\n\nclothing only you can call it a   boyfriend \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Exactly\n Except you can actually buy men's clothing in the women's stores\n\n<$A>  Oh hmmm\n\n<$B>  Things like a boyfriend jacket, a grandfather sweater which\n\nis one of those big baggy cardigans you know really   nice and warm\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Yes exactly but so nice in the winter when\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  It's perfect for the woman with no man's closet to raid like\n\n<,> you and I\n Now every year we get the must-haves\n Those pieces of clothing that nobody should be without\n\n<$C>  You must have uhm, a good blazer,\n working a lot\n\nin the office and things like that you should have at least one good\n\nsemi-fitted blazer\n You should have a good boxy blazer a boyfriend blazer for the\n\nweekends, you know to wear with boots and stuff\n You should have some really great sweaters\n Sweaters are good over jeans or good over leggings or good over\n\nseveral uhm types of pants you may have in your wardrobe so that's how you\n\ncan mix that in\n Uhmm must-haves uh\n Some good bodysuits\n One or two good bodysuits uh a good basic black one which is my\n\ncolour\n And uhm ah one of the colour of your choice\n\n<$A>  you must\n\nhave \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  for people who\n\ndon't have a whole lot of money  or don't want to be ah told that they\n\nmust have anything  how much can you sort of recycle from year to year\n\n\nin   in   anything uhm that uh you know if you don't    want to   completely redo your wardrobe twice a year\n Uh can we sort of uhm carry on with what we've been wearing pretty\n\n  much or,  make it look a little different\n\n<$B>  that\n\n  that   Angela Buccarro was mentioning you know you must have\n\na couple of sweaters well you can use last year's sweaters or the sweaters\n\nfrom a couple of years ago\n Jackets most of us have blazers of some sort, lying in our\n\ncloset or lying    in a   back closet somewhere so\n not necessarily,\n\nnecessary to go out    and   completely rebuy\n\nthings\n a lot of the designers like\n\nAngela Buccarro realize    that   most of us you\n\nknow we    want to   buy a couple of new things\n, go into\n\nwork in the fall with that one, or two, new items that make you feel\n\ngreat\n laugh\n\n wardrobe, twice a year or three times a year or however many seasons\n\nwe have\n that\n\n  those   clothing      here\n\n  yeah \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Yeah well we don't have a three month winter it's seven months\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n say\n This concept of like four different seasons in fashion doesn't work\n\nfor me\n I mean it's summer and then everything else\n\n<$B>  Exactly exactly welcome to Montreal\n Welcome to Quebec I guess\n sort of talked a little bit\n\nAngela and I    about  , how you can update\n\nyour old wardrobe\n Because, sometimes it's a case of taking old things, and\n\nbringing them into the new\n So she did have a few suggestions on how to make that old suit new\n\nagain\n\n<$C>  Supposing you have a black suit, you know and you've always\n\nworn it with this particular shirt    or   sweater\n\n<,> the idea is to go get a sweater that has some black in it\n\n\n example that's got some black charcoal and some white little uhm uhm\n\nhair sticking out,    or   fabric sticking out\n\n<,> that would be a good alternative\n So find something to replace that\n buy the\n\ncolours that suit you best\n look really good\n\n   in   uh black, ah let's say different shades\n\nof greens and blues for example, try to find the sweater that'll go \n\ninto  your green\n I mean it's nice to bring that sweater that you've got at home and\n\ngo shopping and compare if the tones match,\n want\n\nto   add just some sweaters in this season\n or\n\n  or   just a pair of shoes\n some sweaters\n Keep your base pieces like maybe your pants or your blazer,\n Maybe keep your blazer and replace your woven blazer\n Replace it with a knit pant and a knit sweater\n\n<$A>  Well that's pretty down to earth advice\n pretty much how\n\nI function\n kinda\n\n  kind of   can't resist going out and buying something new\n\n  , to   not feel like you're wearing the same\n\nold thing all the time\n Maybe one little trendoid thing and then your staples and well you\n\nknow your safe standards\n\n<$B>  Those same suits that you've had for the past couple of years\n\n  yeah yeah \n\n<$A> \n Well that's good down to earth advice there\n That was from Montreal designer Angela Buccarro\n yesterday and\n\nuh  Marie's  been in with us\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n It is now twenty-nine minutes past eight o'clock, and uh in our\n\nfinal half hour here on Daybreak, we'll be looking at

that's always the ultimate thing for Andre\n\nArthur right\n And he's been sued before\n This is old stuff for him\n\n<$B>  That's right\n four million dollars I think\n\n  is \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>

course what\n\nhas still dominated the business news news everywhere really still and that\'s\n\nthe " r " word\n is a reporter with the Globe and Mail\'s Report on\n\nBusiness\n is a business

\n funny uh you know\n Some of the things that happen in business are so short-term that\n\n   they\'re   funny\n just\n\nshot up into the stratosphere\n Uhm the dollar went way up\n The bank rate fell and prime rate fell too\n The last two things are pretty darn good for consumers\n But this by no means was as we know a definitive vote and business\n\nis still absolutely uhm, paralyzed by what to do by this\n And in many senses they are literally paralyzed\n talked about Matrox before the\n\nelectronics company in the west island\n It was going to shelve an expansion plan altogether if the yes side\n\nwon\n The no side won, but it\'s not going fully ahead with that\n\nexpansion plan\n doesn\'t know how much of it it\n\nwill do, but it certainly knows it\'s going to farm out some of its r and d\n\nactivities to uh Florida where    they already\n\nhave   a small presence\n There\'s just uncertainty right left and centre\n Especially in light, of Parizeau\'s resignation and uh Lucien\n\nBouchard\'s uh, contemplation over his fate\n\n<$C>  Matrox is a very good example of what is going on in the small\n\nand medium size business community\n You have to make a sort of distinction because, if you speak to\n\neconomists about what\'s going to happen to the economy as a whole, uh they\n\ntend to believe uh whichever way their sympathies lie that uh, the economy\n\nwill get back    on an   even keel, pretty fast\n A very large part of Quebec\'s industry uh is made up for example of\n\nresource industries and it\'s very very difficult to pick up a vein of gold\n\nand move it out of Quebec\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  Things like yeah very heavy\n be very\n\nmuch affected uh and they probably wouldn\'t be too severely affected even if\n\nQuebec were indeed to go ahead and separate some day\n But the growth in Quebec\'s economy and the new jobs in Quebec\'s\n\neconomy come from the small and medium size business sector which include a\n\nlot of high tech businesses and a lot of service businesses\n So Matrox is a good example of those businesses uh and other very\n\nlarge uh uh business the apparel business which depends uh on Ontario and the\n\nrest of Canada for eighty or ninety percent of its sales\n And businesses like that, aren\'t, ready to pack up their\n\nbags and leave\n Although at least a few of them are doing that\n There\'s a company called Milton Funwear we may have mentioned\n\nbefore      that    they\'ve had it\n\nwith the\n and even with the no they said they\n\nwere moving\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$C>  There are other businesses that are just saying well you know\n\nwe\'re going to go ahead\n We\'re going to stay here but we\'re going to be very cautious and\n\nwe\'re going to put what investment we can outside Quebec because we want to\n\nhedge our bets\n\n\nwe\'ve   we\'ve   shot ourselves in the foot and we\'re going to\n\nsuffer    a long term and serious   \n\n loss of job creation \n\n<$B>  it\'s not just uhm investors with hard\n\nassets factories and so on\n\n\n an important   part of the Canadian and the Quebec economy these\n\nuhm managers who uh have a lot of investors    from \n\n overseas and so on\n They\'re not sure what to do about Canadian equities\n They\'re very doubtful about Quebec equities\n We saw Morgan Stanley being very very skittish on uh Canadian\n\nequities\n And uh a lot of fund managers are simply not sure about what to do\n So we\'ve got that aspect and a lot of uhm foreign investors hold\n\nCanadian and Quebec debt so that has lots of implications\n All of these factors that we\'re talking about have a lot of\n\nimplications    for   Quebec\'s books, its public\n\nfinances which are in a very messy state\n Uhm the deficit was five point seven billion for nineteen\n\nninety-four ninety-five\n It\'s anybody\'s guess as to whether targets for this fiscal year can\n\nbe met\n\n of taxpayers leaving and companies\n\nleaving\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C> \n\ngive you my bet\n My bet would be very strongly that they will not be met\n Uh Quebec blew its uh its projections last year by a billion\n\ndollars or something\n I\'d be sure that they are going to blow their projections this year\n\nuh by maybe not that much but by a very large amount\n Uh Ontario has already had to make massive additional cuts on top\n\nof the initial Harris cuts, because they were running hundreds of millions\n\n   of   dollars behind on their revenues because the\n\neconomy\'s been slow\n How much slower has it been in Quebec\n\n<$A>  I\'d like to\n the\n\nreferendum behind us   cos I mean the truth is \n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n\n<$C>  We\'re not obsessed\n\n<$A>  phone\n\ncompanies\n mad\n\n<$C> \n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  laugh\n\n  \n\n<$C>  laugh\n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  But what\'s the story\n\n<$B>  said\n\nthat local phone rates are allowed to rise by four dollars a month over the\n\nnext two years\n That\'s two dollars each year\n And then there\'s going to be some sort of unknown increase as of\n\nJanuary nineteen ninety-eight\n January first nineteen ninety-eight\n\n\n  equivalent   amount for most uh most consumers\n upset about is that\n\n   it\'s   still going to be regulated in the long\n\ndistance market\n well why shouldn\'t competition simply prevail\n\n\n Why do we have to go to the C R T C and get our rates approved and\n\ngo through lengthy hearings and so on  \n It thinks that there\'s just an unfair advantage especially by big\n\nAmerican companies\n\n\nonslaught   of A T and T and so on and some of the big heavyweights\n\nsouth of the border\n\n<$A>  Uhm\n They\'re still making money hand over fist aren\'t they\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  making money hand\n\nover fist if you look at the total number of dollars that they\'re making\n If you look at the total numbers of dollars they\'re making in\n\nrelation to the amount of investment they have in their company, I don\'t\n\nthink that their profits are that impressive\n Uh and that\'s what they always like to look at\n or\n\n  or   something like that, it\'s very difficult to uh to\n\nget a sympathetic hearing for that kind of a complaint\n\n<$A>  Uhm\n\n<$C>  There is another aspect to this which is that uh what the C R\n\nT C is aiming at in the long run uh almost everybody uh who knows the\n\nindustry    and   has studied it believes is\n\nprobably a good thing\n It\'s competition, both in the long distance field and in the\n\nlocal field\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  Absolutely none right now but there are cable companies that\n\nhave wires to almost everyone\'s home\n It would not be inconceivable for them to start up a parallel\n\nphone system\n And indeed they\'ve done that in some places like in the United\n\nKingdom\n runs one of those competitve phone\n\nservices \n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  would love to see competition\n\nbecause I would love to be able to fire my local cable company\n And maybe I\'d fire Bell too if they couldn\'t offer competitive uh\n\nuh phone rates\n Maybe I\'d just switch around\n\n<$B>  But the government the federal government has said it is\n\ncommitted to competition in all of these different areas of\n\ntelecommunications cable and telephones and so on\n So uh maybe we\'re seeing it uh put its money where its mouth is\n\n<$A>  Uhm\n What\'s the unemployment rate\n\n\n<$C> \n\n  the   kind of contradictory things it does sometimes\n The news looks bad because it went up by two-tenths of a\n\npercentage point uh in Canada and I think three-tenths of a percentage point\n\nin Quebec\n The news really is good strangely enough\n What happened was a whole bunch of people entered the labour force\n\nin October, thinking that they were going to get jobs\n Many of them did but many of them didn\'t\n So the unemployment rate goes up because there are more people\n\nlooking, but not finding\n the number of employed people went up by\n\nnineteen thousand across the country\n\n<$A> \n That\'s especially significant that that happened in October of all\n\nmonths uh out of all years\n the referendum was\n\nmaking everybody uncertain\n So the fact that people did feel positive enough about jobs being\n\nout there    is   rather interesting\n\n<$C>  The big picture is that we had nearly a year of no employment\n\ncreation from late nineteen ninety-four until late nineteen ninety-five\n Now we\'ve had three months in a row of employment creation\n That\'s good news\n\n<$A>  Next hour on the phone-in we\'re going to get even further\n\naway from the referendum\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  Can I come please\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n Come on\n Everyone\'s doing it\n What three books would you take with you, to the desert island\n\n<$C>  That\'s easy\n Any three books by Patrick O\'Brien who\'s a brilliant British uh\n\nhistorical novelist, whose name does not uh influence my uh my choice\n Uh and they\'d be particularly appropriate for a desert island\n\nbecause these are sea-faring historical novels uh based on the British navy\n\n<$B> \n\nBonfire of the Vanities \n I love that book\n I could read it again and again\n\n\n<$A>  Bonfire of the\n\nVanities   \n\n<$B>  No I\'ll give a plug to two other uh actually local writers\n One is uh Carole Corbeil\n a very interesting account\n\nof English and French Montreal\n The two current sort of crossing\n A very good book\n And the third one is by, actually a friend of mine\n Her name is Diana Atkinson and she\'s just been nominated for a\n\nGovernor General\'s Award\n\n\n Tales of a Stripper and More  \n A lot more to that ook\n It\'s a very complex very well-written book\n\n<$A> \n That\'s great\n Thank you, both of you\n We\'ll see you next Friday\n\n<$C>  Thanks\n\n<$A> \n They are uh the Radio Noon business panel\n is a reporter with

safety inspectors who work for the uh\n\n Société de l'assurance de l'automobile   are being pressured by their bosses\n\n<,> to skewer uh statistics to make the roads look   \n\nsafer   than in fact they really are\n union says that its uh members are\n\ntold, to do random mechanical checks of the trucks and to avoid singling\n\nout trucks that appear to be unsafe\n Société\n\n official about this and he actually seemed to confirm, that in\n\nfact that is what they want\n They want random checks\n for\n\n  for    uh trucks with problems\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Union basically saying that the roads are a lot less safe than\n\n   even we think   they\n\nare   right, even, less safe \n\n<$B> \n\n  statistics reflect   that they\n\nare\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  reason that the uh\n\nSociété does this, at least according to uh, uh what they\n\nsay, seems to be a concern to get statistics that get    a random   sample and to get accurate statistics rather\n\nthan to get unsafe trucks off the road\n\n<$A>  Hmm\n\n<$B>  Does that make sense\n\n<$A>  Yeah and it sounds as if there's a mixed message there\n\n<$B>  It certainly does\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  is almost completely\n\ndevoted to problems at City Hall today\n At the uh top of the page is a story, uh saying that just when\n\nthe City wants to lay off employees it's had to hire, seven hundred\n\ntemporary blue collar workers this summer\n, And this is because apparently thirty percent of its permanent\n\nblue collar workers are on vacation in the summer\n, But the problem is the summer is the busiest time of the year\n\nfor them, because that's when the roads are fixed and   \n\n<,> the   parks    are   maintained and uh\n\n<,> flowers are watered and so on\n times of the year\n\nin fact Montreal    uh has   blue collar\n\nworkers    with   not enough to \n\n do \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n and timing is everything\n\n<$A>  That's right\n\n\n its new contract with the blue collars, but of course uh they've been\n\nin mediation recently but that mediation apparently has broken off, for\n\nthe summer\n\n\n quick     there won't be any quick  \n\nresolutions to that\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  thr\n\n   page three   of  La Presse  this morning\n\n<$B>  That's right\n The other kind of ironic story is that well you know how some\n\npeople    in   some neighbourhoods in Montreal\n\nthey've started getting their garbage picked up every day\n\n<$A>  Mm-hmm\n\n<$B>  uh\n\n<$A>  It's quite a picture isn't it\n\n<$B>  That's quite a picture\n There's a story about a daycare centre in\n\nC&ocircumflex;te-des-Nieges, that had to wait two and a half weeks to have\n\nits garbage collected\n, Uh the daycare did a big clean-up, and put out some old\n\ntyres and    a broken dishwasher   and\n\nwooden cases and things like that, on uh   third of July \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Are there\n\n<$A>  There's some old seventy-eights at the front\n\n<$B>  Well apparently some people were going through it because it\n\nwas out there for two and a half weeks and people were going through it and\n\nreally uh culling some of the   best stuff \n\n<$A> \n Venetian blinds they got it all\n\n<$B> \n\ngone down there \n\n<$A>  Garage sale\n\n<$B>  when they did this it got\n\nspread all over the place   so  it really made a big mess\n\n<$A> \n put this out\n\nfor    you know the big\n\ncollection   that the City does um just after moving day but nobody\n\ncame\n\n\n  they came  , a half an hour after the daycare\n\nhad contacted  La Presse  about the story\n\n\n  coincidence     if that's     was a coincidence there\n\n<$A> \n\nlaugh \n\n<$B> And the strange thing is that the City doesn't seem to have an\n\nexplanation for that\n person they spoke to says well\n\nwell maybe    we had a   lack of staff\n wasn't too sure what the reason\n\nwas\n\n<$A>  But he was on vacation so he couldn't talk\n\n<$B>  that was it\n tied in with\n\nthe blue collars\n\n<$A> \n\n \n\n<$A>  Okay we'll talk to you in an hour\n with the press review on Daybreak\n\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  is here as she is every morning at\n\nthis time with a look at what's in the papers\n Are you managing to get any sleep these days\n\n\n this   hot weather that it's so hot and sticky that, they\n\ncan't fall asleep and when they do they just keep getting up every couple of\n\nhours\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  do a\n\nfair amount of sleeping in the daytime   so \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  kids sleep\n\nokay,\n\n\n<$B> \n\nw    well   I have   fans kind of pointing at them\n\nand they seem to be alright\n\n\nmove to the basement or a  or   \n\neven   down to our living room\n So uh\n\n<$A>  If you have a basement or an air conditioner you're lucky this\n\nsummer\n\n<$B>  Yes definitely\n And apparently air conditioners well for a while there they were\n\npretty hard to come by\n uh gotten\n\nany better\n really a run on\n\nthem in the stores\n\n<$A>  Lots of news in the papers this morning\n\n<$B>  Well yes and uh the big news today is of course marijuana\n The marijuana story is back in the papers and the focus, in the\n\nFrench press is that nobody wants to do anything about it\n The story is that uh up to a million plants are being cultivated on\n\nCrown land in Kanesatake that was the story that broke yesterday\n local\n\nFrench language newspaper  front page says  the authorities wash\n\ntheir hands \n is that the ball\n\nis being passed back and forth between, Ottawa and Quebec City and that\n\ncertainly seems to be what's happening\n The Federal government says Kanesatake is not a reserve it's a\n\ncommunity in Quebec and therefore comes under the jurisdiction of the \n\nSecurité du Québec  \n, But meanwhile Premier Parizeau is saying that the, pot is\n\ngrowing on Crown land and so it's a Federal responsibility\n\n\nRoyal CAnadian Mounted Police  should deal with it because he doesn't\n\nwant the S Q coming into the area\n\n\n  that   marijuana was growing in Kanesatake on Monday night\n\nthrough the media but there's a lot of scepticism about  this\n\n\nthere's a picture uhm in which uh, the man in charge of security for uh\n\n   the   band  Joseph Ouellet  is\n\npointing to a field where he said he burned twenty thousand, marijuana\n\nplants on the first of July so this can't be the first time that    the   band council has heard about it\n\n<$A>  in the last\n\nhalf hour of the programme this morning\n about uh ten minutes\n\nbefore nine o'clock\n I know that's a long way away for most of you but, if you are\n\nnear the radio you    want to   hear more about\n\nthis story and uh directly from him this guy in charge of peacekeeping then\n\n   we will   be talking with him at the end of\n\nthe programme\n\n\n<$B>  Joseph\n\nOuellet  are in fact behind the marijuana growing operation so, that's\n\na story that's not going to go   away  pretty  <unclear> word\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$A>  one thing\n\nthat we haven't heard yet and I'm sure we will some columnist is going to\n\nbring this up is that uh,    you know they  \n\nwouldn't be growing this if people weren't smoking it\n that\n uh this would be just another weed if uh there wasn't\n\nthat factor involved\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  So although people are pointing fingers at the different\n\nparties so far the one party that hasn't been pointed at is, those people\n\nin the public that smoke the stuff and uh\n That'll come up though\n\n\n<$B> \n I'm sure all the angles will be explored\n uh has a story today saying that uh a\n\ncompany called Canadian Life is now offering to buy the insurance policies of\n\nAIDS patients\n This is a phenomenon that's existed for some time in the States\n\n<,> but it's new here and there was an amendment to the civil code in Quebec\n\nto allow this to happen, uh so now this company is here doing this\n And what they do is they pay an AIDS patient, fifty-five to\n\nsixty-five percent of the value of their life insurance policy\n Canadian Life then takes over the premiums they pay the premiums\n\nand then they collect    the   benefits when the\n\nperson dies\n The paper says that a Montreal doctor who works with AIDS patients\n\nhas agreed to help the company\n And this doctor whose name they don't give in the article, says\n\nthat a lot of AIDS patients have no money and uhm no family and that this\n\ncould help them, live their final years uh in more comfort\n But the paper also quotes a law professor at the University of\n\nMontreal who says that he has an ethical problem with this\n\n\n sort of like betting on the death of the sick\n\n\n<$A> \n\n  that's   the thing   \n\n   from   what I can gather from the story\n\nand from what I've seen in the States is that uh the people   who are\n\ninvolved in the business end of this are selling it on its practical merits\n Ah however uhm when you examine the ethical uh problem here as the\n\n   uhm University of Montreal \n\n professor uh comments that uh    there \n\n are    some   uh serious questions\n\nthat are raised by this and uh I know a lot of people are uncomfortable with\n\nthis\n\n<$B>  Well another problem with it is that they only pay fifty-five\n\nto sixty-five percent so    there   is a big\n\nprofit, to be made by this    they \n\n get quite a big cut out of the insurance policy\n are a lot of\n\nquestions   <about this/[2>\n\n<$A>  Second overlap occurs over\n\nextracorpus text", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$B>  In fact it was one of her very first signs uhh that I noticed\n\ndriving down the road in towards Ormstown\n There's a beautiful sign, for uhm Brysonwood Farms\n With a big Holstein cow on it\n A beautiful green sign with a coloured cow under the name\n\n\n\n Uhm, in fact I asked the owners\n where\n\n  where   did you get that beautiful sign\n Suzette\n\n sorry   and led me to her home\n Now she's set up in the basement of the old family farm\n full of stone walls quite warm\n\nand cosy but it's filled with all sorts of modern woodcutting painting\n\nequipment\n All sorts of things\n\n<$A> \n\nthe   the one   uh the one outside of  \n\n the   Holstein farm\n But what types of signs does she make\n\n<$B>  Well you've probably seen this sort of thing\n village for instance is full of\n\nthem\n\n in\n\nsay, ski towns up north in Stowe, perhaps in Vermont\n The typical nice, wooden sign\n They're textured signs\n Very colourfully painted\n And there's lettering on them of course\n But, they've also got animals or scenes or something or other\n\nthat make kind of a picture or a logo\n in her basement\n\nworkshop\n So why don't I let her explain, a little bit more about what she\n\ndoes\n\n<$C>  Probably a lot of what uhh people are seeing now is ah\n\nsandblasted signs\n Uh the sandblasted signs are made from California redwood or,\n\nsometimes Western red cedar\n Uhm the reason for that being they're very durable outside and they\n\nhave a very pronounced grain pattern so when they are actually sandblasted\n\n   the   wood grain shows up and    it   gives it a very unique warm look uhh that people\n\nseem to go for\n I\n\ndo a lot of fine art renderings of,   well we do a lot of farm\n\nsigns   cows    and   special paintings\n\nthat people, order\n the\n\n    on the sign  \n Uhm peel away the parts that we want sandblasted and then uh uh\n\nblast away and that wears the uhm soft sapwood down leaving    the   growth rings standing out\n\n\npronounced grain patterns\n And it leaves the letters and whatever details uh we have standing\n\nout from the background of the sign\n\n<$B> \n\n and   imaginative with flowers and bees and animals in uh odd\n\nplaces\n You're very artistic\n\n<$C>  Well thank you\n Uhm, we always try to add some sort of pictorial element that uh\n\ndraws people's eyes at something special\n It just sets, uh our signs apart from from the rest and we\n\nreally try to work at that\n But it's a whole field of study\n colours the\n\nartwork    it's like    a \n\n   puzzle that I'm continuously working at and uh trying to come\n\nup with uh new and better designs and uh it's just uh a whole world of fun\n\n<$B>  Well some villages, like Stowe for instance, I think\n\nthey've passed bylaws where everybody's sign has to be    a\n\n  wooden sign\n\n\nbusinesses like yours\n\n<$C>  Oh yeah I think that's a terrific idea\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  everyone should do that\n Uhm\n\n<$B>  Is that sort of thing happening in Quebec\n\n<$C>  Uh yes\n In fact I have quite a lot of work in Pointe-Claire village\n non-illuminated sign\n\nbylaw there\n if you've ever been to\n\nthe village   it just gives a really nice warm village-type feeling\n\n   to   a shopping area\n How do you sell your product\n Well, that's a tricky one\n\n\n  advertise    \n\n\n\n<$A> \n\ntape starts mid word  amount of work, just from that\n It's the signs, when people see them they know that's what they\n\nwant   but \n\n<$B> \n I mean I passed one on the road uh Brysonwood\n my eye\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  I went in and asked who made that sign\n\n<$A>  Well that's great\n That's one of my very first signs\n good friends and\n\ngood neighbours and uh we did a business card design    to\n\n  ah match their's\n Holstein\n\njournal and they have    an   ad that matches \n\n  their   sign\n So it's getting the farmers in to uh thinking about this a little\n\nbit more\n selling their\n\nuhm genetics more and ah and travelling abroad and this just gets them uhm a\n\nlittle extra cachée I think\n\n<$B>  A little image\n\n<$A>  That's right\n Precisely\n an\n\n  apple farmer in Rockburn pretty soon\n nice sandblasted sign\n I'm looking forward to doing that one\n Those are, really my favourites\n And uh we're working on some glass right now\n We're doing a little decorative glasswork for the new clubhouse at\n\nthe Ormstown curling club\n\n\nreally enjoy\n It's a bit quiet right now but uh that's normal for this time of\n\nyear\n\n<$B>  So what sort of equipment do you have here in your own home\n\n<$A>  work out of your basement\n That's right\n This is my big shop here\n small\n\n  power tools\n As you can see, I'm limited as to space\n We work with uh jigsaws and uh and that sort of thing\n Uhm I have a lot of, chisels and and carving tools\n\n<$B>  It looks like if you get busy you're going to have to expand\n\nfrom the basment\n\n<$A>  we have uh kind of tentative\n\nplans to uh convert the shed on our house to ah to    more\n\n  shop space and build on a little bit  \n But right now it's nice to run it\n It's cosy down here\n Uh sometimes it gets a little bit full\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Uh she coats out panels\n She cuts things out\n Uh really everything, short of designing and doing the fine art\n\nthings\n we have a lot of fun together\n\nso\n\n<$B>  Now this is a business going on, on the side of a,\n\nchicken farm\n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B> \n\n  \n\n<$A>  I tell people that uhm my\n\nhusband is president in charge of the chickens and I'm vice-president\n And I'm president in charge of the signs and he's vice-president\n So uh he helps me when he can, and uh I uh help him out when\n\n<,> I can\n new batch of\n\nchickens in there now so I spent most of the morning in the barn and now I'm\n\n<,> back at my desk uh doing design work\n as\n\na uhm   as a way   to do something with    my\n\n  art, here from the farm, and  \n\n it's really succeeded  , uhm amazingly well  \n\n in   a short time\n\n<$B>  Did you marry into chicken farming\n\n<$A>  Uh yes in fact\n just grew up down the road here\n\nand I used to work on a farm    as a student  \n my uncle and drove,\n\nah combines and tractors and that sort of thing\n And then, I started going out with the guy I met on the school\n\nbus\n And uh well, here we are\n and partners\n\n  in the sign business too\n So it's really uh the best of both worlds as far as I'm concerned\n\n<$C>  Hmh, who is that again\n\n\n<$B>  Yeah that's right, that's right\n\n<$C>  I ask the questions\n\n You're kind

anyone\n Again the same thing applies as uh applies to everything else in\n\nQuebec\n Try telling this to somebody outside this province, or outside\n\nthis country\n\n\nout of twenty-two thousand-three-hundred \n It\'s an absurdity\n\n<$B> \n It\'s incredible\n and uh\n\nPierre F C&ocircumflex;té was interviewed\n I don\'t know if you saw it or heard of it\n\n\n<-that the >   uh that the   unity rally was more an affront\n\nto Quebec\'s democracy    than   the electoral\n\nfraud\n\n<$A>  Okay I\'m glad you brought that up\n I want to get to the uh\n I want to get to the unity rally\n And we\'ll do that and we\'ll also be back with more of your calls\n\nafter we hear from  Kenny Mulder  with C J A D Skywatch Traffic \n\n\n\n<$A>  We are back\n talk show on C J A\n\nD\n We\'re talking about Pierre F C&ocircumflex;té and whether or\n\nnot he should, uh resign\n\n\n people coming to uh Montreal for the Canada Day rally\n He\'s not that upset about out and out voter fraud and stealing of\n\nballots, but when it comes to this rally he\'s quite upset and he feels\n\nthat uh companies and individuals uh outside Quebec were involved in last\n\nfall\'s unity rally\n lengths that are\n\ntruly    absurd  \n In this country we have freedom of speech\n We have freedom of assembly\n We have freedom to travel\n But there is such a state of delusion in Quebec that the electoral\n\nofficer feels that before people can decide whether they will travel to\n\nQuebec during referendum they have to have Daniel Johnson approve their\n\nexpenses\n I\'m not making this up\n is happening\n It is outrageous\n\n\n  investigators   cos they have uh no uh\n\nright to do that\n Most uh legal experts agree that Quebec can\'t possibly make its\n\nreferendum law stick against, transactions that took place beyond uh the\n\nborders of uh Quebec\n The sale of a ticket or the, the rental of a bus\n I mean there is freedom of assembly\n People have the right to come to Quebec\n Quebec is still part of Canada\n They can travel here, and march here and put up a, a banner\n\nand do what they want\n To suggest that they have to have these expenses approved, by\n\nthe head of the no committee while they ignore all the work the unions did\n only one word for it\n\nand that word is " absurd "\n Let\'s go back to the phones\n\n Good afternoon\n You\'re on C J A D\n\n<$B> \n Uh I know you\'re a master of words and a great debater\n And uhm I not often agree with what you say but in general uhm I\n\nappreciate the way you defend your cause\n You are not an analyst\n You are a militant but that\'s alright with me\n But I think this time you are pushing really too, too far\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  And as Judge uh Goldbloom are both people of great competence\n\nand great integrity\n\n<$A>  Wait wait a second\n It\'s\n First of all it\'s Judge Gold and the thing is in terms of the\n\nintegrity\n So as far as you\'re concerned looking at two-hundred-and-ninety is\n\nenough, right\n and\n\nfinding some   fraud but nonetheless ignoring the twenty-two-thousand\n\nother boxes, that\'s okay\n\n<$B>  Okay let\'s put the thing in context\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  They are twenty-thousand boxes, okay\n Twenty-thousand-three-hundred-and-something\n Now, on each boxes there was a representative of the no and a\n\nrepresentative of the yes committee\n\n<$A>  That\'s right\n And when there was a conflict the yes committee was the one that\n\nhad the final decision\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  A no member had a recourse\n\n\nif   why   are we looking at twenty-nine boxes\n Because they complained there were irregularities there\n been\n\ntrying everywhere to find if there were not any other places where there were\n\n  irregularities and    nobody  came in with any\n\none  \n\n<$A>  ho\n\n   hold   it hold it  \n you and I had this same conversation uh or a\n\nsimilar conversation yesterday\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Yes you have your theory\n I have mine\n But I mean it certainly would have been easy to check a few more\n\nboxes to look into a few more ridings than just to look at three ridings very\n\ncarefully\n that\'s very\n\nimportant\n You\'re talking about how militant the federalists are\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Excuse me let me finish\n For the no scrutineers in Lac Saint Jean, it would have been\n\npretty difficult for them to throw a big fuss because their neighbours and\n\nfriends and relatives are all yes supporters\n They didn\'t want to make a big issue out of it\n So they may have let no votes been thrown out\n What\'s wrong\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  So why don\'t you prove me wrong\n very easy way\n\nto prove that I\'m wrong, and that\'s by   looking into the boxes \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And you know what\n If they look into the other boxes and they find that there is no\n\nevidence of voter fraud in the other twenty-two thousand\n They don\'t have to look into twenty-two thousand\n Let them look at another five hundred, or a thousand and they\n\nfind no evidence I will publicly apologize, if they do that\n Thank you for calling\n Let\'s go to our next uh caller\n Adam </@ \n Good afternoon\n You\'re on C J A D\n\n<$C> \n Uhm one of the things that I found rather bizarre\n serious issue but\n\nI mean it\'s sort of got    twilight zone aspects\n\n  to it\n When uhm Pierre F C&ocircumflex;té says that there\'s\n\nabsolutely no evidence    of a   national\n\nconspiracy\n Well of course no one is actually talking about a national\n\nconspiracy\n\n\n<$A> \n noticed that\n\n\n\nconspiracy  "\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  Yes I know\n I don\'t think anyone in Saskatoon was involved\n\n<$C>  No\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$C>  And the other thing\n I mean unless they\'re talking about the conspiracy to sell plane\n\ntickets\n\n\n first   of all    they\'re  \n to\n\n  to   take the attention away from what would normally be\n\nworrisome in a democracy like tampering with votes\n Uh they suppressed uhm free speech\n public\n\nrecord that federalists like Guy Bertrand Keith Henderson and Steven Scott\n\nBrent Tyler   wanted to actually  argue publicly    as a   political argument the issue of the rule of law\n\n\n  from   uh exercising   that democratic right\n\n\n\n<$A> \n it\'s a very good idea\n\nthat Robert Libman is taking this to uh the Supreme Court\n The whole referendum law is unfair\n These are rules made by separatists to make it uh convenient as\n\npossible and the other nationalist party doesn\'t like to do much to\n\ncontradict them because they want to get these soft

{'text': "<$A>  and this hour we're talking about the\n\nQuebec referendum law\n Should the law be changed, instead of splitting everyone into a\n\nno committee and a yes committee\n Uh we're talking about this in the light of some of the charges by\n\nthe director general of elections Pierre F C&ocircumflex;té to many\n\npeople who participated in that Canadian unity rally last October uh that uh\n\nhe considered to be more a serious violation of democracy than the widespread\n\nvoter fraud\n Now it's my pleasure to bring in, to the studio Julius Grey who's\n\na constitutional lawyer\n And he's a professor of law at McGill University\n Julius a pleasure to have you here\n\n<$B>  Oh it's always a pleasure to be here\n\n<$A>  Now Julius uhm I spoke of uh earlier the fact that we've\n\nchallenged the referendum law\n Beginning of nineteen-ninety-two you represented me when I was the\n\nhead of the Equality Party at the time\n Uh calling this a violation of freedom of expression\n The fact that we're forced to participate in one of these two\n\ncommittees\n And we can only spend money if approved by one of these two\n\ncommittees\n Uh the Supreme Court recently agreed to hear the case\n Maybe you can outline for our listeners the two competing arguments\n\nwith respect to Quebec's referendum law\n\n<$B> \n\n two   to one in the Court of Appeal\n So there are two types of judgments\n One favourable to us by Mister Justice Bourassa\n speaker uses French\n\npronunciation  Bisson Delisle and Michaud\n But all of the judges all favourable and unfavourable agreed there\n\nwas a violation of the charter\n The uh only question is uh whether this violation of freedom of\n\nexpression and perhaps even freedom of association is justifiable in a free\n\nand democratic society\n And, there are, several positions possible\n The extreme position accepted by American courts including the\n\nSupreme Court of the United States is that you can't put spending limits at\n\nall\n I don't think that would wash in Canada\n I think spending limits are a reasonable thing\n And uh in Quebec there are elaborate ways to make sure that there\n\nare spending limits\n Uh for instance only individuals can contribute to any campaign and\n\nonly up to a certain maximum\n Whether it's an election or whether it's a referendum\n Under those conditions then why is it necessary to restrain speech\n\nand not let you speak out\n maximum\n\nand that there is no way uh corporate and uh union uh dues can be used\n What is the reason\n And that is what it turns on\n Whether the prohibition of all expression uh that uh outside the\n\ntwo umbrella committees, is a reasonable limitation\n tr\n\n I find quite shocking, you can't campaign for an abstention\n You can't campaign against the question\n You couldn't publish a book of essays, some of which are for and\n\n  some of which are against \n\n<$A> ,\n But let's stick to the specifics here\n Let's use the example of uh this past referendum\n If one of the groups\n If some type of group such as the Equality Party in this past\n\nreferendum wanted official status in the no committee to bring up certain\n\narguments and Daniel Johnson did not want to permit them a platform to bring\n\nup    some   of those arguments he is perfectly\n\nwithin his right based on the referendum law   to block them from\n\nholding a rally or distributing material \n\n<$B>  Yes he could be,\n that committee\n\n  that judicial committee but that's for a small amount\n And if he acts reasonably uh there's nothing you can do\n Let me give you an example\n Suppose some extremist English group, had said we want people to\n\nvote yes because we want partition now\n Now can you imagine Mister Parizeau's and Mister Bouchard's\n\npredicament having to fund people who are coming to say exactly the opposite\n But it's no more legitimate\n\n<$A>  from\n\nthe population\n\n\n<$B> \n it can have a\n\ncounter   it can be counter productive  \n Technically I'm for\n\nthe yes or for the no  but for such ridiculous reasons that everybody\n\nunderstands that   it's really <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$A>  to\n\nfreedom of expression to   express that opinion \n\n<$B>  absolutely\n That's what I'm saying\n On the one hand you shouldn't force uh Parizeau and Bouchard to\n\nspend their money on them\n But on the other hand it's totally illegitimate in a democracy to\n\nprevent somebody from having    his   say\n So the best solution is to allow groups outside the umbrella\n\ncommittee to speak independently as long as the money is raised uh    within the   limits\n\n<$A>  So the government's primary argument is that this is the only\n\nfeasible method of keeping spending under control for a referendum campaign\n\n<$B>  Well that too is of course uh uh highly disputable\n There are other countries which have limits on how much you can\n\nspend\n But no country\n There is\n We could not find a law as draconian as this in trying to control\n\nthe type of spending and by whom\n Uh it's clear I think that uh you could think of a law which is\n\nperfectly effective, and which doesn't go as far as this one\n Which is of course one of the leading arguments under the charter\n If you're going to violate the charter, you have to show that\n\nthis violation is the minimal one necessary to achieve an important end\n And I think you're going to have a hard time with that\n\n<$A>  Seven nine oh oh nine nine one is the number to call to be\n\npart of the program\n We're discussing Quebec's referendum law\n the phones right\n\nnow and  Cam  you've been standing by\n Welcome\n are you there\n Peter and\n\n you're on the air\n Welcome\n\n<$C>  Yes\n Hi\n I have a couple of points to bring up\n\n\n healthy thing\n You know it gives people the opportunity to get together\n\n<$A>  Joseph do you have a comment about the referendum law\n We know we've heard you on this program many times\n\n So uh what's your comment about the referendum law\n\n<$C>  So so what do you mean\n Do I have to use\n What I have to use\n Do I have to give you my mother's name too\n\n<$A> \n\nEd \n\n<$C>  Don't be so miserable\n out with\n\ntheir bikes    one   day a week\n\n<$A>  did you have to uh\n\n<$C>  No but listen\n sovereignists they\n\nwant to go    to   the United Nations for us to be\n\nable to look uh at what's going on the next uh uh referendum\n Did you know that\n\n<$A>  Well for uh do you agree that the probe should be a lot deeper\n\ninto the alleged uh rejection of no votes\n\n<$C>  No I think that the United Nations should be there the next\n\ntime   so that you don't have any  uh false feedbacks\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  And don't forget that the Germans you know in the last war\n\nthey thought that they would win by propaganda throughout with the radio\n didn't succeed\n The Nazis didn't win uh with it\n\n\n you know   by giving <unclear> word </unclear> \n win nothing\n\n<$A>  I don't understand what you're\n\ntalking about  Ed   \n\n\n\n  uh to   help monitor the next referendum campaign \n\n to make sure \n\n<$B>  word\n\n</unclear>   \n\n<$A>  Uhm\n Seven nine oh oh nine nine one is the number to call to talk about\n\nthe Quebec referendum law\n What are your thoughts\n Do you believe that the existing law should stay in force with all\n\nexpenses uh being declared under either the no or the yes umbrella\n Do you believe there should be spending limits on referendum\n\ncampaigns\n What are your thoughts\n What are your thoughts about the probe by Pierre F\n\nC&ocircumflex;té about voter, fraud\n\n He is the president of the Algonquin College student association\n thank you very much for being with us\n\ntonight\n\n<$D>  Not a problem\n Not a problem at all\n\n<$A>  describe for us uh your heinous crime\n\nwhich has led to uh your being charged by Quebec's director general of\n\nelections\n\n<$D> \n Uhm what actually we've done is we've gone to uhm uh the major\n\nextreme of renting two buses, two Voyageur buses to bring students down to\n\nMontreal where you are uh to stand for their country\n Crazy crime isn't it\n\n<$A>  Uhm hum\n\n<$D> \n\n<$B>  Did you spend the money in Ontario or did you spend it in\n\nQuebec\n\n<$D>  In Ontario\n\n<$B>  And did the people who actually spent the money go into\n\nQuebec\n\n<$D>  Uh did the people actually I'm sorry\n\n<$B>  to get on\n\nthe buses \n\n<$D> \n\n<$B>  No but on the buses\n\n<$D>  Oh on the buses\n Uh on the way to Quebec or in Quebec\n\n<$B>  No, for the buses\n Did anybody charter buses in Quebec\n\n<$D>  Oh I'm not sure\n\n<$B>  didn't\n\n<$D> \n\nOttawa \n\n<$B>  what I'm getting at is that it\n\nseems to me on principles of constitutional law that Quebec provincial laws\n\nin Canada are strictly territorial\n You can't charge anybody with anything that happened outside the\n\n  province \n puzzled by these\n\naccusations\n\n<$D> \n\n<$A>  So that's one important point\n how did this come about\n How did the director general of elections investigate\n Did they come to see you\n Did they interview people that were on the bus\n How did this charge come about\n\n<$D>  They came to see us actually in the beginning\n\n\nQuebec elections police to come and see us\n Uh from there they contacted Voyageur bus where Voyageur uh told\n\nuh or I guess surrendered documents stating who actually had rented buses\n\nfrom them that day to attend the rally\n\n<$A>  So that's how they went about it\n Now what uh could the consequence of this charge be eventually\n Was that uh described to you\n\n<$D>  No it hasn't actually come to us\n we got a\n\nfine for two hundred and sixty-six dollars stating that we had violated the\n\nQuebec elections act and uh asking us to pay within thirty days\n\n<$A>  to pay\n\nthat fine\n\n<$D>  No no\n uh to the\n\n  charges and take it from there\n\n<$A>  that you've been\n\ncharged\n\n<$D> \n\n<$A>  Now what\n Did you raise, issues with the director general of elections or\n\nyou just received this notice from them and you haven't had a chance to\n\nquestion the charge at all\n\n<$D>  Yeah we haven't really questioned it\n\n\ncharge on in paper to my lawyer\n\n\nexactly what   you've just talked about\n So they're going to check into everything, find out if there's\n\njurisdiction et cetera et cetera\n\n<$A>  Now did you expect this at all when you rented those buses or\n\nyour, rented the bus or your intention at the time was just let's go to\n\nMontreal\n Let's plead for Canadian unity and that's it\n Did you ever imagine that this would come about\n\n<$D>  No not never\n Never not at all\n We never,", 'subdomain':

congratulations for fighting the brave fight from\n\nthe beginning uh when you saw what was going on in uh your riding\n Now are you satisfied with the results of uh Pierre F\n\nC&ocircumflex;té's

fraud \n We all knew that it had taken place\n And it was predictable that the prosecutions would have to come\n What was stupefying however was to hear Pierre F\n\nC&ocircumflex;té go on to say that having your fundamental democratic\n\nright, your right to vote stolen from you was not an attack on democracy\n\n<,> but attending a unity rally was\n there's\n\n  no logical way to defend that position other than the fact that it\n\nwas dictated to him by the P Q \n\n<$A>  Now in terms of what was dictated to him by the P Q\n He looked at two-hundred and ninety boxes\n even\n\nthough  even though he found all of this evidence in the two-ninety that\n\nhe did look at\n\n<$B> \n\n got that exactly right \n\n\n\n<$A>  Let's do something for everybody\n Let's be there with everybody else\n\n<$B>  Well that's one of the questions that could be asked for\n\ninstance as far as the referendum law is concerned\n\n\noutside a country to want to express their views about what's going to happen\n\n\noutside of province it's even more obvious because people in the rest of the\n\ncountry have a direct interest\n How are they to do it if the only way to spend money is through two\n\numbrella groups in Quebec\n\n<$A>  Yep\n\n<$C>  Did you at all think of, contacting one of the no side to\n\nget approval for coming into Montreal to participate in this event\n\n<$A>  No\n Not at all\n was\n\nbrought up we had people from like\n For instance we're a community college so uh we're normally in\n\ntight contacts with our community with MPs  et\n\ncetera\n Uh the community

uh be able to express their freedom of expression or\n\nbecause of the way the referendum law is structured, there are certain\n\nimpositions on that\n\n\n<$B> \n\nthe supreme court has said it over and over again is particularly important\n\n<,> in political matters and artistic matters\n It exists you know\n seen that even commercial\n\nissues and so on there is freedom of expression\n But when it comes to politics and artistic expression they're\n\nabsolutely sacred\n And here you've got a situation where all sorts of points of view\n\nmay be kept out altogether\n And I'll give you the list\n This type of view from outside the province\n Satirical views mixed views uh hesitating views\n\n\n  to   say maybe one way maybe the other\n\n It's unfair in my view\n\n<$C>  Seven nine oh oh nine nine one is the number to call to be\n\npart of the program\n Or star eight two five five if you're in your car\n We're talking about the referendum law, Pierre F\n\nC&ocircumflex;té's report\n\n\nMarilyn Talbot  \n\n\n\n<$A>  That law of course has led to Pierre F C&ocircumflex;té\n\nbringing charges against many people who participated in the Canadian unity\n\nrally last October twenty-seventh\n And also, the outcry over Pierre F C&ocircumflex;té's\n\nreport of the past couple of weeks of course was because he said that that\n\nviolation of Quebec's referendum law where people spending money to come to\n\nMontreal for that rally was more a black spot on democracy than the\n\nallegations of widespread voter fraud\n The rejection of no votes in ridings with high concentrations of no\n\nvoters\n Seven nine oh oh nine nine one is the number to call or star eight\n\ntwo five five\n And Julius just before we go to the lines again I want to ask you\n\n<,> about that comment by C&ocircumflex;té where he says that uh this\n\nviolation of Quebec's uh referendum law is more a black mark on democracy\n\nthan these allegations of voter fraud\n he mean what he said\n Was he just na&iuml;ve\n just so sort of in this\n\nbureaucratic mindset that he is so involved absorbed with applying the law\n\nthat he just didn't realize what he was saying\n\n<$B>  Yeah but while we have thought that uh one violation was\n If that were the case one was more important than the other\n I found it incredible that remark\n\n\nincredible that some other commentators\n\n\neditorial afterwards which supported him on that point\n I would say is this\n The additional spending uh is controversial\n It's before the courts\n The supreme court gave\n There was a split decision on the court of appeal\n Supreme court gave leave\n Obviously it's something that can be debated one way or another\n But if there is anything more fundamental in a voting system in a\n\ndemocratic system than fair counting I don't know what it is\n I mean that is really a subversion of everything\n And in this particular case you realize how close it was\n Another fifty thousand or sixty thousand, the result might have\n\nbeen different\n And then we would have been in for a real uh uh see-saw with uh\n\nfirst    a   yes victory declared then taken away\n would never\n\n , would have   taken twenty years to heal\n Uh I cannot see how not applying a controversial and legally uh\n\ndoubtful although arguable provision can be more serious than the most\n\nfundamental uh violation with respect to counting,   \n\nand   uh equality in that way\n\n<$A>  I think is the\n\nmost troubling is the fact that the yes side the sovereignist side which\n\nnever leaves a stone unturned in these things did not ask for a recount in\n\nsuch a close vote\n And that to me is perhaps an indication that there was some\n\nknowledge at the top that vote tampering took place and therefore they didn't\n\nwant that to be   brought forward \n\n<$B>  another argument that they\n\ndidn't want for instance to being the government they didn't want to create a\n\nsort of uh uh tension that would have resulted from\n You know you could have many explanations of it\n for a\n\nrecount\n And we don't know why they didn't\n Or perhaps they felt that fifty thousand was enough\n Again that there wasn't going to be a change and that it was\n\nsimply going to prolong the agony\n So, I wouldn't draw that conclusion\n But I still find Mister C&ocircumflex;té's statement\n\ncompletely incompatible with basic principles of election\n\n<$A>  How about uh Judge former Justice Alan B Gold\n has he been in this\n When I heard that he was to head up this investigation I felt that\n\nthis would be a fair and thorough investigation   yet we haven't\n\nheard  from him\n\n\n<$B> \n\n give press\n\nconference\n He made a report\n The report found what was uh done\n He wasn't to editorialize\n The editorializing was done by Mister C&ocircumflex;té and\n\nI fear that it was wrong\n Uh the former chief justice did exactly what his function was\n\nwhich was to produce a report, and to make it perfectly objective clear\n\nand step aside\n\n<$A>  Now these charges that are being laid against many of these\n\ncompanies that boarded buses or came or spent money for the unity rally uh\n\nlast October\n If the case before the supreme court gets a favourable judgment\n If we win this case before the supreme court that those sections\n\nof Quebec's referendum law are unconstitutional, will these charges be\n\nerased\n These charges against these companies\n\n<$B> \n\n the charges   from the last referendum law if it's declared to be\n\ninvalid uh will    lead   to acquittals\n That doesn't mean that the government will not be able to amend\n\nthe law for the future  in order to provide some sort of\n\ncontrols\n Presumably lesser controls than these\n The supreme court will certainly not say I don't think, there's\n\na free for all\n They're going to say this particular legislation went to far,\n\nso you're going to have to    repair  \n\nyour legislation\n So I think chances are very high, if we win, that the\n\npresent charges would fail\n But there would be a new law in place for any future referendum\n\n<$A>  How would they change the law specifically\n Do you think they would allow other committees uh greater access\n\ninto the uh   ability to  participate in the referendum\n\n\n<$B> \n has the three thousand\n\ndollar spending limit\n Every individual\n\n<$A>  Only individuals right\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n the\n\n  outside   these committees\n\n<$A>  But that already exists right now in present referendums\n\n\ndollars \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  They still feel that if they did open it up to other\n\ncommittees,    there   would be a proliferation\n\nof these small groups that would spend uh up to a certain amount and no one\n\ncan control the number of those groups   that are created \n\n<$B>  would still have to be\n\nlimited to that same amount of money\n Which otherwise they could donate to the yes or no group and spend\n\nit\n Remember, the law does not provide for equal funds for each\n\ncommittee\n uhm I\n\nthink it was three million dollars or something to each group and that\n\nwouldn't change\n The yes and the no would each get a certain amount of money\n\n\n up to I think an additional equal amount has to be raised\n So it's perfectly possible that one of the groups will raise twice\n\nas much as the other and will have somewhat more money\n And here we're not going outside the spending limits\n We're simply allowing each individual to spend his maximum\n\ncontribution\n I must point out to you there'll be very few people who will give\n\nthree thousand dollars\n\n<$A>  Uhm hmm\n\n<$B>  Uh to spend it up in any way he wants\n protection is\n\nsufficient you see\n find the government's fears that\n\nin the space of six weeks or five weeks it will be a million committees\n\nfinanced    by   some mysterious forces    probably from   outside is bordering on paranoia\n In order to\n\n\nsince the early seventies \n\n<$A> \n\n  big business   might come in and control the result\n\n<$B>  But business cannot do it\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>

and\n\nthen they came out with golf carts\n And uh then, people mowed their lawn and this was good exercise\n\nand then they came out with these little tractors they sit on    and   there went the exercise\n And now hunters, uh have these little tree huts and uh they\n\njust sit in those all day and uh they just sit in those all day and uh uh\n\nwait for the deer to come out\n And even worse

there was the report by Mister\n\nC&circumflex;té\n There was the going back and forth between Mister Bouchard and\n\nMister Chrétein\n he said\n\n  you know who's maybe not looking so bad in all of this is Daniel\n\nJohnson\n Remember him\n He was premier of Quebec at one time, for seven or eight months\n And, he's the leader of the Opposition and he was the leader\n\nof the No forces, in the

Quebec's uh constitutional\n\nfuture\n well the majority of Quebecers\n\ndon't like Guy Bertrand and think he's    a clown\n\n \n\n\n now   I'm just telling you how the French  speaking\n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n<$A>  heard your disclaimer\n\n \n\n<$B> \n\n would   which is why I'm     \n\npicking up signals   that Daniel Johnson, alone of all the\n\npoliticians in this thing seems to be steering    a  \n\ncautious and central course\n\n<$C>  Well uhm I have trouble with someone who steals a cautious\n\nand central course in this one and it seems to me, quite apart from being\n\nin tune with the mainstream of opinion which sometimes is good and sometimes\n\nis not, uh that Johnson    has   taken what\n\nlooks to me like a very troublesome line in most of this\n And there's two issues that come to mind\n\n\n the referendum, where Johnson has left all of the leadership, to a\n\nvery very junior backbencher    who's   done a good\n\njob\n But I have to ask why the leader of the No committee hasn't been\n\nactive on this issue \n\n<$A>  You're talking about Tom Mulcair\n\n<$C>  Yeah\n\n\n that   bothers me very much is he is simply fitting into the\n\nmainstream by adopting    the   separatist line\n he's indicated he's prepared to\n\nconsider a unanimous resolution    affirming \n\n Quebec's position\n And I find for him to be taking a separatist line might be in\n\ntouch with mainstream opinion but it doesn't strike me as making him a very\n\neffective leader of the federalists\n\n<$D> \n\nmainstream Quebec   opinion is mainstream French press\n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  Lapine last night\n\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D>  just let me finish\n\n  \n\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$D>  So that now I don't figure that most of the media is\n\nmainstream uh the way Quebecers think\n Uh I think Daniel Johnson has been just the opposite\n I don't think he's been playing this very well at all\n I think he's been trying to pull a Bourassa\n And that's falling down on both sides of the fence\n And the only thing you get, when you sit on the fence is\n\nsplinters\n He has to come down on one side or the other\n He's afraid to alienate the nationalist vote\n I\n\n  I   believe I know that to be true\n He's afraid to uhh put off this one\n He's afraid to put off that one\n He comes out sounding like a separatist on one hand because uh\n\nOttawa has no business in Quebec's future\n And on the other hand\n I mean he's on the one hand on the other hand\n I feel like I'm watching Fiddler On The Roof\n I'd rather watch somebody who's a strong leader with whom

good example of that is, let\'s look at the question they\n\nasked us\n If I understand it correctly the question said do you give us\n\npermission to talk to the federal government, and if that doesn\'t work out\n\nthen certainly our option is to separate\n Am I correct that that was the correction\n\n<$A>  Well they weren\'t really asking permission to talk, to the\n\nfederal government as I understood the question\n They were saying we\'re going to vote to become sovereign,\n\nhowever having voted to become sovereign we\'re going to offer, an\n\nassociation with Canada and if they accept it in a way that we accept within\n\na year fine otherwise, we go our own way\n\n\n<$C>  then they come back and they take their\n\nforty-nine percent and they say well here are our forty-nine percent of the\n\npopulation who support, separation\n Which is untrue\n\n\ngoodly   portion of that forty-nine percent, support,\n\nnegotiation with the   federal government \n\n<$A>  is true\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  who\n\nvoted yes and a lot of them weren\'t for total independence\n\n<$C>  And nobody questions him about that\n It\'s incredible\n I hear them in speaking to the federal politicians and being\n\nquoted in the press\n And it\'s startling to me\n So yes absolutely the rules have to be, fair for both parties\n\nand they haven\'t been up to now\n\n<$A>  And Daniel Johnson\n\n<$C>  Daniel Johnson\'s a nobody\n\n\nentities here to deal with, one called the federal government and the\n\nother one are the power-grabbers in Quebec City\n I\'m sorry but Daniel Johnson and all the other,

up to the plate\n\non this Bertrand case but the reality of it is that the rest of the country\n\nwould be highly effected economically and in other ways as well by a\n\nunilateral declaration of

of them at one time\n\nor another but uh Daniel Johnson,    is   a\n\ncommitted federalist\n There's no question about that\n a\n\n  committed federalist and that's fair game\n But he is that\n I assure you\n\n as a\n\nmatter of fact uh, a few weeks ago before the Johnsons went on a tour of\n\nthe West, I had   uh lunch with Missus Daniel Johnson Susan\n\nMarseille who I also uh know, and uhm  \n\n she's   like a crusader for Canada\n She's so passionate about Canada\n And the reason we were lunching together is they had some\n\nappointments, uh to be on some talkshows out West and she wanted, my\n\nopinion about who ah    would   be\n\namenable    to   letting them get the message\n\naccross and who might not, and so on\n they\n\nare   very much federalist, greatly federalist\n Uh

sir\n I think you're a little uhm cynical about, politicians\n I don't, hold it against them that they want to be elected\n You can't do what you want to do without being elected\n Uh but I think most politicians and it doesn't matter what stripe\n\n<,> are into it because there are certain things they believe in and they\n\nwant to accomplish them\n However, you notice I didn't interrupt\n I let him give his whole speech there\n\n\n<$B>  Yes hello\n\n\ncharacter, and his absurdities but    I   won't\n\nwaste my breath but I would like to submit this to you sir concerning    the march uh uh in October   preceding the referendum\n\nand the report that came out    I would   ask\n\nyou    are   the laws, that were made up in\n\nQuebec concerning referendum are these valid, to you\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  legal\n\n<$A>  would you listen now\n You've asked a question\n If you're telling me that I can't go to a rally without charging\n\nthe money to, the no side or the yes side let me tell you cos I'm assuming\n\nnow that you're a separatist\n\n<$B>  Yes I am\n\n<$A>  Let me tell you that the most stinking, dirty, filthy\n\n<,> trick, of the whole referendum campaign, was using the people's\n\nmoney, the people's money through the  Caisse de\n\nDeaigupocircumflext  , to prop up\n\nthe Canadian dollar, to give the lie, that the Canadian dollar wasn't\n\nbeing affected, by the referendum\n\n<$B> \n answering my question\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  question\n\n\n\n<$B>  question\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  I am answering you're question\n You are an idiot\n Sorry about that\n I'm not supposed to get mad\n And so ladies and gentlemen, smiling he said let us go to the\n\nnext caller\n But let me finish what I said\n charge up\n\nmy   I went by subway to that ah gathering   if I    got to   charge up my token to the no committee\n\nthere's something wrong with the referendum law\n It stinks\n And that's basically what they're talking about\n You know, somebody flies in from Vancouver, and today we've\n\ngot a little bit less of a price and so that's cheating, that's lying,\n\nthat's crap\n That's what that is\n,\n\nspending hundreds, of millions, of your, dollars, to buy Canadian\n\ndollars, so that the obvious, won't be there, that the Canadian\n\ndollar is being affected, by the referendum, that was cheating\n That was money cheating\n And that, was the yes side\n And they didn't investigate that one did they\n And it was your dough\n\n\n<$C>  Hi how are you\n\n<$A>  Well I'm just fine\n a very good mood\n\n<$C>  So am I\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  You know what I got a solution to this whole problem\n You remember in seventy when they sent in the tanks well they\n\nshould sent in the airforce the army and the navy to scare these guys because\n\nyou can't talk to these guys\n These separatists you can't talk to them\n\n\n the   C F eighteens are flying over that's when they understand\n\n<,> that's the answer\n\n<$A>  Okay sir\n I don't agree but uhm, some people would agree with you\n\nprobably\n I don't think there's much doubt about that\n\n\nought to   come down,  to warfare eventually\n Uh, I'm not of that ilk\n\n\n<$D>  Hi\n I find this whole thing pretty scary\n I want to ask your opinion\n would it take to get a\n\ncomplete recount of the last referendum\n\n<$A>  the\n\n  point where uh it could uh be done\n And even if it were done uh uh so what\n\n<$D> \n\n<$A>  the declaration would be that the no side\n\nwon but we already have that   declaration \n\n<$D>  the point being that we're supposed to\n\nbe a democracy\n And the thing that we cherish the most is going out and voting for\n\nthe government that we want\n\n<$A> \n\n<$D>  uhm I really think that if Daniel Johnson is\n\nreally a federalist as he claims to be I have no trust in him anymore uhm he\n\nwould somehow find a way to have a complete recount because uhm what if we do\n\nhave another referendum, and they win\n uh god forbid they, are going to\n\nbe our government\n I don't know what's going to happen here\n\n<$A>  But recounting the last one ma'am is not going to have any\n\neffect on the next one\n\n<$D>  Well no but recounting the last one will show they really\n\nwant to come clean\n\n<$A>  Yeah I must say that I agree with Tommy Schnurmacher, uh\n\nwho says that he thinks there was probably no ballots destroyed in every one\n\nof the one hundred and twenty-five ridings in Quebec\n I wouldn't be surprised\n\n<$D>  believe that because I know\n\nwhen I went to vote uhm for the first time in my life they questioned me\n\n<$A>  Yup\n\n<$D>  And I found that strange but of course I didn't know of the\n\ngoings-on until after the polls closed\n\n<$A>  They questioned me too and they made me swear that uh I\n\nneeded to vote in the advance poll which of course I did because I was\n\nworking here during the election and when I put my left hand on the bible to\n\ndo my swearing, uh they allowed \n\nit wouldn't count unless I put my right hand\n How's that one for you\n\n<$D> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$D>  like to get after Daniel Johnson to make\n\nsure that we know the real truth here because  this is wrong\n\n<$A>  Okay ma'am\n

believe in my estimation give the\n\nanswer to,    what does Quebec want   if only he can\n\ndefine for me in French with the French meaning of    the adjective " \n\ndistinct  "   as in " \n\nsociété

the French culture in\n\nAmerica, and I think everybody would agree with that\n And at the United Nations homeland is always translated in French\n\nby "  patrie  "\n say\n\nit\'s homeland of

federal\n\nLiberals did a couple of weeks ago\n\n<$C>  and\n\nthat\n\n<$B>  the heck is the\n\ndifference except they called it the fireplace but uh,\n\n<$C>  My point is uh, " distinct society " has\n\nbecome a symbol in   Quebec \n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  If you want to get rid of it you\'ve got to find a better word\n\n<,>    but   not different but better word\n " I suggest to you\n\nis much better word    because   there is\n\n" patriotism " et cetera uh than,  foyer principal\n\n which as you know    leads   to all sorts\n\nof jokes\n But I agree with the fundamental question, we should get rid of\n\n" distinct "\n But I\'m not the Prime Minister of Canada so uh, you know I\'m\n\nhere to solve the problem but I  here to give suggestions\n\n<,> and I\'m puzzled    to know   that

{'text': "<$A>  a forty percent uh so-called\n\nmark-up or margin of profit which is uh fairly hefty\n\n<$B>  That's right\n uh has another\n\ninteresting story    it says that uh  \n\na sergeant-detective with the M U C police has been suspended for using his\n\nservice    revolver   to shoot a raccoon\n\nin Old Montreal\n The paper say this happened at around eleven P M on Saturday night\n\n<$A>  reckless isn't it?\n\n<$B>  sounds like it\n\n\nhe saw    the   raccoon making his way behind,\n\nan apartment building where the officer lives and he shot it twice apparently\n thirty-three\n\n  which is near there arrived a few minutes later and began an\n\ninvestigation\n Now the police haven't released the name of this officer and the\n\npaper says , and I'll quote the paper  as usual\n\ninformation about an incident involving a member of the police force, was\n\nnot available \n really being quiet\n\nabout this\n The animal apparently disappeared after it was shot nobody's found\n\nit\n was\n\ncalled but    they   looked around   and\n\nthey couldn't find it \n\n<$A>  to\n\n  to   get your target practice and I don't think uh the\n\ntraditional way is to go after raccoons especially ah for the precedent that\n\nit sets because there are lots of raccoons in the city   nowadays \n\n<$B> \n Especially in the middle of the city alright\n In Old Montreal on Saturday night\n\n<$A>  Ah boy\n\n<$B>  Aah Parizeau is back from vacation and back on the front pages\n\nin a big way today, not just talking about pot but other things\n He's ah accusing ah the federal referendum minister Lucienne\n\nRobillard of trying to organize a common front, with the nine other\n\npremiers\n He says the premiers are getting ready to gang up, and say that\n\nthey would not discuss economic or political links with a sovereign Quebec\n\n\n premier Gary Filmon was asked to lead the common front so he uh sort of\n\ncame out and tried to expose this yesterday\n When the papers uh contacted the premiers though they said they\n\ndidn't know anything about this\n Mike Harris says he doesn't know about it and, so did some of\n\nthe others\n Robillard is quoted as saying that this is all just a fiction\n\ninvented by Parizeau, to make people forget what else, lobsters  \n\n  \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  And\n\n<$A>  based\n\nout of Montreal is uh looking at that story by the way\n And uh if you listen to World Report today you could get more on\n\nthat\n\n<$B>  And uh now that Parizeau is back the lobster puns have been\n\nrevived\n front page of The Gazette says\n\nthat  Lobster is back on the menu  and uh that's because  the   issue came up  yesterday at the press conference\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\nhe denied what   was reported in  La Presse  the day\n\nthat the story broke\n side-stepped though\n\nwhen uh he was asked well   did you mention lobsters to\n\nthe European ambassadors at all? \n Uhm he says that the whole thing is just laughable and ridiculous\n\nand it's really just    a   quarrel among journalists\n\n<$A>  thanks very much\n\n<$B>  You're welcome\n\n<$A> \n\nin   less than an hour to talk a bit more about what's  some of\n\n the columnists are saying in the paper this morning \n\n\n uh any impact yet?\n\n<$B> \n\nto    to use    when we're talking\n\nabout traffic there  Kyle  \n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$A>  No collisions\n\n\n<$B>  No\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  is back as she is every day at this time\n\nwith a look at a couple of the editorials in the morning papers\n I imagine\n\nyou're one of those people who is breathing a sigh of relief with a bit more\n\nrain for the garden, even though we had a lot of rain    on the weekend   uh there's been kind of a dry summer so\n\n<$B>  Yes although the only problem with that is that you have to\n\ncut the grass\n it stays short and you can\n\nleave it like that\n rains\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  All that work to be done\n So what's in the editorials this morning\n\n<$B> \n\na   long editorial in  Le Devoir  today about the\n\nmarijuana growing in Kanesatake\n He says that uh, when the government decided to crack down on\n\ncigarette smuggling  you know  this is both the provincial government\n\nand the federal government,\n What they did was they reduced taxes tobacco taxes\n They didn't really do anything about the smuggling conducted by\n\nMohawks\n And so he says uh when it became less profitable for criminals in\n\nthe community    to   smuggle tobacco they turned\n\nto other products\n And he says ah marijuana is not the most dangerous of the products\n\nthat they    turned to  \n He says that the warriors are really thugs who don't have the\n\ninterests of uh the community at heart\n of\n\n  of the   community    he   really analyzes the kind of shirking of\n\nresponsibility on the part of    the   federal and\n\nprovincial governments on this issue so it's quite    a \n\n long and analytical editorial\n\n\ntoday about the two big libel suits, that were in the news last week\n Do you remember there was a story that uh the biggest award ever\n\nwas given to uhm uh a case  uh   \n\nupheld   by the Supreme Court and in this case   \n\nthe   Church of Scientology was sued for one point six million\n\ndollars,\n And the other story of course was that uh Lucien Bouchard is suing\n\nthe popular radio host Andre Arthur\n Gravelle says that uh the Church of Scientology, claimed at the\n\ntime to be deprived    of   its freedom of\n\nexpression by the Court's decision,\n Yet he says the Scientologists try themselves on many occasions,\n\nto use the libel laws to muzzle journalists, who are making legitimate\n\nenquiries into their finances and recruiting methods so that, whenever\n\njournalists were getting close to something uh about their recruiting methods\n\nor their finances they would then threaten them with a lawsuit a libel suit\n Uhm and he says that uh uhm, it's true that the media does try\n\nto protect its own interest in these cases and does often say that uh uh\n\nfreedom of    expression   is at stake\n But he says not too many uh colleagues of Andre Arthur are going to\n\ncry for him if he's convicted\n Gravelle says that uh the biggest threat to freedom of expression\n\ncomes not from the courts, but from buffoons and    demagogues   like Arthur who think that they can say\n\nanything they want as soon as they get in front of a microphone\n\n<$A>  Well the thing about that Bouchard story that strikes me\n\nthough is that I think probably would've got much much less attention    if   the suit had not been launched by Bouchard\n That it was a story that wasn't getting much play, outside of\n\nArthur's show and uh also uh a few uh publications that don't have a\n\nwidespread circulation\n the\n\nstory which   the story which   obviously upsets Bouchard in\n\nthe first place\n\n<$B> \n\nthe amount of money it's one point four million dollars so\n Arthur has been sued many times in the past I don't think uh\n\nperhaps uh for that much money\n\n<$A>  thanks very much\n\n<$B>  You're welcome\n\n<$A>  is here every day at this time with a\n\nlook at a couple of the editorials from the morning papers and uh if you're\n\ntuning in at about six fifteen every morning she has, a very complete\n\nrundown on uh what's in all the papers uh that circulate around Montreal\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  A D\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>

{'text': "<$A>  Good afternoon and welcome to Free-For-All Weekend, edition\n\nwhere the Free-For-All gang, looks at the news of the past week and makes\n\nsome comments about it\n Alan\n\nRinaldi   Eliza Green  and  George Fraser \n And ah I guess uh uh in Montreal, one of the big things that came\n\nout this week although it was early in the week and by now it's kind of uh a\n\nbit in the past but we had a couple polls that came out early in the week\n Interesting in both cases\n\n\nsuggesting that they're    out of   here in many\n\ncases\n Although, there could be a little exaggeration in that I suppose\n And in the other case all ah Montrealers including francophones\n\nallophones  and anglophones uh seemingly much more lenient about\n\nwhat kind of a city Montreal should be, ah compared to the people that uh\n\ngovern us    at all   levels really\n\n<$B>  I don't think those polls exaggerate in fact they may\n\nunderstate because, I've seen polls of young people which indicate a\n\nfigure as high as seventy-five percent    who  \n\nplan to leave\n And of course for a lot of older people they feel well there's too\n\nlate to leave now or their jobs are here or they have a mortgage here but for\n\nyounger people that constraint isn't there\n of course it's the leaving\n\nof the younger people in the long run that   hurts more \n\n<$A>  for sure,\n\n<$C>  Well there ah ah number of things that come up from the polls\n\n\ncough  is that the politicians are woefully out of touch with what people\n\nreally want or really care about\n Parti Quebecois, governing\n\npolitical party  has been, and continues to be obsessed not just with\n\nseparation but with language and it is not an obsession with your garden\n\nvariety Quebecer\n They have other things to worry about, like eating for example\n\n ,  or working\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  That's more important\n So I think that uh that the poll indicates that to a great extent\n leaving\n\n  I don't think is an exaggeration\n I do think it is is are people\n\ngoing to leave in terms of separation\n\n\nmet or heard too many people on the air who say that if Quebec separate \n\n  they would   leave but that doesn't mean\n\nthey're leaving tomorrow, or next week or even next year   it means\n\nin the event \n\n<$A>  that I think is exaggeration\n\nin that poll\n talking about, thirty\n\npercent who say they're leaving within five years, no matter\n I'm quite sure that five years ago we had a similar poll that said\n\n<,> thirty percent were leaving within five   years no matter \n\n<$D> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$D>  that said\n the same thing\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n easy to say to a ah\n\npollster you know, uh yes you're fed up and the pollster calls and says\n\nwhat's your view would you leave within a  you bet I would leave\n\n    but a   lot of people can't\n\n<$D>  think the erosion is already\n\ntaking place\n\n\n  the English-speaking population  \n\nand I think that'll continue\n People aren't leaving in masses\n They're leaving as soon as they can sell their house and,\n\nreasonably find another job somewhere else\n\n\nbecause they want to they're leaving because they can't, picture a\n\ncontinuance of life as they've had here in the future\n And that's why they're going\n\n\n sale that  don't have signs in front of them\n\n<$A> \n\n<$D>  Ah a lot of people that I've talked to have quietly said\n\n ya well our future isn't here    we're\n\nfinding   our way out of here \n\n<$C>  was saying about the young\n\npeople I mean there is a certain segment of the  \n\n anglophone   population who have no children here, anymore\n of the population where uh\n\ntheir children two or three of them not one of them lives in Montreal\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C> \n\nelse in North America\n And there are other segments of the population where you know two\n\nout of three have left or one out of three have left or one is planning to go\n\nor, once the kid is in graduate school    or  \n\nuniversity somewhere well why come back\n That's the erosion, that's the hardest part of it\n\n\nin your   in your   living,   make a living    as a   professor  , kids will leave, and\n\nif you don't have a base from which to choose from the locals, ah you have\n\nto reach out more and that gets harder to fund and all the other stuff that\n\ngoes with it\n\n<$B>  Ya if you look at the English schools they've been cut more\n\nthan half in last twenty years\n you know that catches up\n\nthat hits the universities eventually\n the radio\n\nabout two years ago with some professors who were saying  oh it's\n\nnever going to happen they'll keep coming \n I said where're they going to come from\n it's happening of course\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Enrollments are dropping in the universities now\n\n<$D> \n\n<$B>  North America but\n\nwe're going to get it worse because   the base you draw from \n\n<$D> \n\n<$B>  Ya oh ya\n\n<$D>  a greater\n\ndrop in enrollment in Montreal\n universities than elsewhere in North America, I'm not\n\nsure of that \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  we'll know better\n\n    we'll know better   cos this just started uh\n\nlast year and we'll know better when we see the figures for the coming year\n\n<$A> \n\n \n\nmany elderly people in Montreal they're sure enough they're kids aren't here\n\n<,> uh and when they get to a point when they need special care, there's\n\nnobody here to care for them  \n your son and your daughter and\n\nall of their family are now living in Missisauga, when it comes time to be\n\nlooked after I guess you    got to   go to \n\n Missisauga \n\n<$D>  now there is a problem because they are the\n\nones that are least capable of pulling up roots and   leaving \n\n<$A> \n\n<$D>  th\n\n   there's   the rub   and that's why we have to\n\nensure that the    health   and    social   that's why we shouldn't flee we should\n\nfight because we have to ensure that those that can't flee are protected\n\n<$A>  but if it comes a point\n\nwhere you're going to go into the nursing home and your pensions are going to\n\npay your way it might as well be a nursing home in Colberg or Missisauga\n\n<$D> \n\n I'm    correct me if I'm wrong   but it's\n\nvery difficult if you're    on the bottom\n\nline   of this equation like if you're not living on much more than\n\nyou Canada and Quebec pensions it's very hard to make the transition from one\n\nprovince to the other\n\n<$A> \n\nQuebec pension \n\n<$C>  your\n\npension       it's portable\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$D>  don't you have to go onto a waiting list in\n\nthe other province\n\n<$C>  room\n publicly funded old peoples's\n\nhomes\n\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$A>  your Quebec\n\npension     goes where you go \n\n<$D>  word\n\n</unclear>\n\n<$C>  But you're just talking about the other places\n\n<$D> \n\n<$B>  it's also a question that if you're living\n\non the bare edge of survival and    you know and the\n\nextra cost just of moving to this location    is a \n\n major   hurdle <unclear> word </unclear>   \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  a couple of\n\nthings one is, is it better to be old in a home alone here, versus \n\n  a   little more expensive place but near your children\n\nyou know    that's   the most important thing and\n\nthe other thing is as children,    I   suppose we\n\ncan talk about this at <unclear> word </unclear> we can't leave uh leave the\n\nresponsibilities of our parents to somebody else\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nthat's   right\n a\n\n  a   nursing home, it's kind of nice that uh your kids and\n\nyour grandchildren can come by on Sunday and say hello\n Uh they can't do that if the kids are in Missisauga\n\n<$D>  in\n\n all of this\n\n<$A> \n\n<$D>  tend to think,\n\n  well, I have this fight with my wife    she's a francophone  ,  \n\nI mean she says  we    got to   leave this\n\nprovince these people are    going to   make our\n\nlives hell \n\n<$A> \n\n<$D>  I said no, we can't leave\n This is our life, this is Quebec this is where we live this is\n\nour home   this is  where we are going to stay\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  where\n\ndo you think your kids will be     \n\ntruthfully   truthfully \n\n<$D>  well both\n\nof them want   to live here in Quebec\n\n<$A>  Where do you think they'll be\n\n<$D>  I think they'll probably be here in Quebec\n weird like\n\nthat\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$D> \n\n is really happy   in Quebec \n\n<$A> \n\n     thought that too  Tim  and I have three\n\ndaughters all of whom    are     \n\nso   bilingual as to be virtually bicultural, but two of them are\n\ngrown up and guess what one lives in Vermont and one lives in Ontario\n\n<$B>  not\n\nsimply a matter of language legislation or quarrelling over legislation it's\n\nthe fact that this quarrel obscures everything else that has to be  \n\n added   and nothing else\n gets done and I think ultimately what's the most\n\ndisgusting part of it \n\n<$A> \n\n<$C> \n\nthat's why it gets   defeatist   because  no matter what\n\nwe do this envelops this overshadows this wraps us this is our life\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  That's right, and it's, sometimes, a little tough\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  Alan\n\nRinaldi   Eliza Green

harbour\n\n\n<$B>  I mean that\n\nwas the biggest story \n\n<$C> ,\n\n<$B>  Ah because ah for a variety of reasons, that it was\n\nsomething out of a movie that happened on the   high seas  and that\n\nCanada got involved almost by accident because the boat happened to be here\n\nand the eight Filipino sailors, asked for refugee status, because the R\n\nC M P wouldn't get involved and then they would because, one arm of the\n\ngovernment overruled another arm of the government, because the Romanian I\n\nmean was international intrigue\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Ya it was\n\n<$B>  and just to throw a curveball in\n\nthere   I    want to   know why the\n\nRussian spies story hasn't gotten more coverage\n I like that one\n\n<$D> \n\n<$A> \n\nSpeakers A, B and D all speak at same time

{'text': '<$A>  was there like, I was to\n\nwitness uh the crowds boo and you don\'t often get that kind of, uh\n\nvolatile reaction at a tennis match\n uh a staid crowd isn\'t\n\nit  Marie \n\n\nnot a   surprise to see that but uh ah very different uh to\n\nexperience that yesterday\n\n<$B>  Yeah it\'s certainly not something you expect when you go to\n\ntennis\n You expected at most little bit of polite applause or no applause\n\n   but   the boos certainly shook the stadium \n\n  as   Rusedski walked in and walked out and, took a\n\nbreath   and \n\n<$A>  thing\n\nthat got me too was that you know the boos didn\'t stop\n to\n\n  quiet the crowd down by saying  merci merci  so as\n\nto try and get them to quiet down but it was kind of funny to hear    the   boos followed by the  thank you, boos\n\nthank you  \n\n\nthe   crowd to quiet down\n But they weren\'t too out of hand\n I guess not that unexpected though right that I mean you know this\n\nreaction was there\n\n<$B>  Nooo\n I mean, Greg Rusedski everyone when we\'re talking about you know\n\nhe\'s a native Montrealer and he\'s welcome home but he doesn\'t consider\n\nhimself a Montrealer anymore\n So, you can\'t really expect much of a warm reception for someone\n\n   who   you know says that sort of thing\n It was a tough day\n He had two matches to play as you said he had to play in singles\n\nand in doubles\n\n\nthe singles competition uhm which is really where the I guess we can call it\n\nthe anti-Greg Rusedski sentiment uh started\n And it started even before he walked out onto the court\n through their\n\n  through the   stadium the crowd began to boo and we could\n\nsee    that he   was coming just by the sound\n\nnot even    by   looking to notice him\n And then as Rusedski walked by the stands somebody actually took a\n\ntennis ball and threw it at him\n\n\nbut   it did startle him and it sort of startled people    in   the crowd who weren\'t really expecting that sort of \n\n thing \n\n<$A>  word\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$B> \n think the tennis ball I mean the\n\ntennis ball missile pretty much sums up, what the match was like in terms\n\nof the crowd reaction\n Once in a while you\'d get a little bit of, light applause mm\n\nvery polite applause\n which\n\n  read in French  Welcome to Montreal we love Greg \n But further along in the stands there was another sign which called\n\nGreg Rusedski  Le fou de la reine  meaning " the\n\nQueen\'s   fool " \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  welcoming\n\n  ah welcoming   thing to look at\n uh might have\n\nthought you know    and   you  \n\n would have   been correct in thinking that Michael Joyce was a\n\nCanadian cos he certainly was the favourite in this match\n And the cheers were so loud for him, every time he won a point\n\nor anytime he touched the ball actually\n\n\ncheers that Rusedski got when he blew a point\n Now one of the things that was interesting was that Greg Rusedski\n\n<,> kept smiling throughout the match\n from\n\n  the warm up to the cool down    to  \n\ntalking    to   people later on\n Now either it was because it didn\'t bother him, didn\'t want\n\npeople to know he was bothered\n But afterwards he said that it was because the crowd didn\'t bother\n\nhim\n\n<$C>  hurt\n\n   me at all\n thought that I was going to\n\nget    a   difficult reaction\n I kind of expected it so, I was prepared for it\n\n\nhow   many times have you been to a tennis match and, seen so much\n\nexcitement from controversy going on\n Good practice for Davis Cup I guess\n\n<$A>  guess he makes a point to a\n\ncertain extent and we saw that smile by the way in Wimbledon\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  that match against Pete Sampras\n Even when he was losing he managed to, maintain that smile\n I wonder sometimes if whether or not that\'s a psychological\n\ntechnique    that   he\'s  employing \n\n  to   keep his spirit up uh when he plays tennis\n\n<$B>  quoted as\n\nsaying that he really wanted to go out during Wimbledon and wipe   the\n\nsmile off  , Greg Rusedski\'s face so\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  was\n\ninteresting because    he   said that several times\n\nthat he wasn\'t bothered by the boos and that he went out to just have some\n\nfun, but it\'s interesting cos we talked to Michael Joyce, the man \n\n  that   he faced in that match uh he saw a pretty\n\ndifferent reaction when they walked out  of  the court together\n\nyesterday afternoon, to that chorus    of   boos\n\n<$B>  Joyce says that you know the boos might not have affected Greg\n\nRusedski during the match he    might have  \n\nbeen able to play, but it certainly did have an effect on him before the\n\ngame\n\n<$Z>  I could tell before the match Greg was really nervous, and\n\nit didn\'t look like he was nervous because of, he was playing me as much\n\nas it looked like he was nervous he doesn\'t know what really to expect,\n\nuhm\n\n\n we heard   the boos coming    and  \n\nGreg and I were    kind of   laughing about it at\n\nfirst and\n And then it just got, you know even more and more\n tough because like I\n\nsaid again you know they\'re cheering for me but, they\'re not really\n\ncheering for me because they like me they\'re just cheering for me cos  he\'s the enemy all of a sudden\n\n<$A>  Hmm\n Michael Joyce uh talking a bit about uh the crowd reaction\n\nyesterday in his match with Rusedski\n Now uh uh I notice he also said that uh it was, difficult for\n\nhim because he\'s a friend of Rusedski so it put him in a tough spot\n tough as the\n\nafternoon was uh the doubles match in the evening was I guess even tougher\n A bigger crowd and the sentiment even stronger\n\n<$B>  That\'s true\n\n\n a   doubles team that was from Quebec    or from Canada   but a doubles team  \n\n that was   from Quebec\n the two Sebastiens came in\n\nSebastien Lareau and Sebastien LeBlanc they were greeted by a standing\n\novation\n And there was sort of a question of whether maybe the cheers for\n\nthe Quebecers, would drown out the boos but you know that  \n\n the   sentiment switched\n the\n\ncrowd saw Rusedski the boos started\n pronounced \'full\n\nforced\' \n And you know just to give you an idea of how loud they were you\n\ncould hardly hear the player introductions coming out over the loudspeaker\n Now Rusedski, on the other hand said he thought the evening\n\ncrowd actually showed more respect, particularly towards his partner Paul\n\nWekesa\n\n<$C>  thought it was calmer\n When I came on I mean obviously gave us a little bit of a tough\n\ntime   but I  thought they were very, polite in certain respects\n\nbecause Paul was there and    I   was pleased about\n\nthat because Paul has nothing to do with it so\n Paul some respect\n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A>  That\'s uh again Greg Rusedski talking a bit about uh uhm his\n\npartner during uh the doubles match yesterday\n Uh now we\'ve uh heard a lot from Sebastien Lareau, and Greg\n\nRusedski and the fact that there is uh some tension between the two\n Tell me a bit more about that element of all this and how it played\n\nout in the match and afterward\n\n<$B> \n the game had\n\neven   the match had even   started\n There was the talk that Lareau had said the other day that there\n\nwas a lot of motivation for him to win\n Rusedski uh in contrast said it was just going to be another tennis\n\nmatch for him but, Sebastien Lareau said several times he had the\n\nmotivation he really wanted to win this one he really wanted to win this one\n\n\nlast night it switched\n All of a sudden he was saying no it was just uh a regular match and\n\nit wasn\'t uh as important that he was just going out there to play to play\n\ntennis\n Rusedski felt the same way\n But, we\'ve heard a lot from them from Sebastien Lareau and Greg\n\nRusedski um but other Canadian tennis players have remained relatively quiet\n Last night, I had a chance to ask Sebsatien LeBlanc what he\n\nthought of all the build up around this first doubles match\n\n<$D>  I saw the match as another match, I guess\n don\'t care about what Greg does I\n\ndon\'t care about what Wekesa does,\n It\'s,\n They\'re just both tennis players\n think it\'s ridiculous that uh,\n\nyou know you think it\'s a battle of ex-Canadians\n It doesn\'t matter what he\'s doing\n Uh it\'s his choice\n not the\n\nright choice but    if that\'s his   choice that\'s\n\ngood\n But uh, I think it\'s just ridiculous that you know you, it\'s\n\nnot a battle\n Tennis is a game and\n\n<$A>  Sebastien LeBlanc\n thank you very much for this\n\nreport\n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n<$A>  joins me again\n I was down uh at the Old Port last night and\n\nthe C word    was   the common uhm  \n\n the   C letter I should say uh was the theme as it turned out\n pay the\n\nthree fifty that you have to to get on the pier, to go see the show\n I know Lauren Elliot was down there last night, and I was there\n\ntoo late for him so I decided not to go\n But I walked around, and first I saw a street performer uh\n\nplaying some Cat Stevens music\n And then there was another street performer who was playing some\n\nshow tunes from Cats\n And then there was uh somebody playing some Cantonese music\n So we got three Cs so far\n And then there was the Aroma lady\n Have you run across the Aroma lady yet\n\n\n<$B>  one of the women in The\n\nBays   who squirts you with perfume or something \n\n<$A>  kind\n\nthis is   the morning aroma \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  The one that you\'re probably smelling this morning, coffee\n That\'s the other C\n She walks around with a uh what looks like a huge backpack a space\n\npack, and it has a hose and she has coffee cups and she goes around giving\n\nfree cups of coffee\n I forget the name of the company that she does it for\n It\'s probably a good thing\n\n\n<$B>  Oh okay,\n uh\n aromas you know\n There\'s not just coffee there\'s other uh unpleasant aromas too\n\n  that uh \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nthis   this is the coffee    lady

of\n\nCanada\n Parti Quebecois\n\n\n\n<$C> \n\n he say to the people of Quebec that look they don't really respect us\n\n<,>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  that\n\n<$A> \n First of all he says that anyway\n that no\n\nmatter what you do, so that we know that\n That's his position\n can do all kinds of things\n\nbut he can't blame Guy Bertrand  and  the uh Federal Government\n Guy Bertrand's a Québecker, and he's a former\n\nsovereigntist\n of\n\nthe   P Q \n would be\n\nwhat   is   what he needs\n Cos it is going to be rejected\n I mean that's clear\n And the Federal Government is, ridiculous to attempt it because\n\n   the way   they can get out of it is,\n\nthey're saying why should we pursue something, that's been turned down,\n\nin advance, by the Premier of Québec\n So they should say, as of today that's it\n We tried to do it\n There's no point in doing it, because Lucienne Bouchard doesn't\n\nwant it\n stood up in\n\nthe House of Commons and voted against it\n\n<$C>  I agree\n honestly believe that\n\nhe could really, uh this Guy Bertrand case is good news or this is for all\n\nfederalists and Canadians\n see it also at the same time as,\n\nBouchard's political ammunition for the   future \n\n<$A>  the thing is you know you can always tell\n\nif it's working for Bouchard or not if he's pleased about it\n He's not pleased with Guy Bertrand\n\n\n I would uh worry\n\n There's no way he can blame Guy Bertrand on the federalists\n Uh let's get back to the phones\n\n\nChambers'  opinion that this is    an   Alice in\n\nWonderland uh, court case and it's not an important court case and the\n\nFederal Government shouldn't have gotten, involved in it\n In all honesty she said neither should the Québec\n\nGovernment\n But she feels that we should go back to Plan A\n Do you agree with that or disagree\n Uh, we'll be back with more of your calls after we take this\n\nbreak \n\n<$A>  Good afternoon\n We're back and we're discussing uh Guy Bertrand his court case and\n\nuh Gretta Chambers and your reaction to uh her column about, uh the court\n\ncase if you agree or disagree\n\n Good afternoon\n\n<$D>  on your new job\n\n<$A>  Thank you\n\n<$D> \n\nimmensely\n\n<$A>  Oh thank you very much\n\n<$E> \n\nChambers' \n I've read a lot about her and I, read your article in the\n\nGazette and everything but  ,  she  \n\n\nwhatever\n The point is, she's another Richard Holden, another David\n\nPayne\n\n<$A>  of\n\nall\n Hold it hold it\n First of all she's not intermarried uh\n\n<$A>  widow\n\n\n and   \n\n<$D> \n\n<$A>  No no he wasn't,\n\n<$A> ,\n\n to do   with   it \n\n<$D>  she's\n\nnot   coming out positive\n Like Richard Holden, David Payne,\n These people are forfeiting our rights, okay as Canadian\n\ncitizens\n Nobody has the right to take my Canadian citizenship from me\n\n<$A>  No you're right I think the Betrand case is uh making a point\n\nof   uh, of saying that \n\n<$D> \n\n\n<$D>  You're doing a good job\n\n<$A>  Okay\n very much\n\n<$D> \n\n<$A>  It's true\n I mean one of the things that Guy Bertrand's making the point of\n\nsaying that he doesn't want uh, the separatists to do anything that takes\n\naway the rights of Canadians living in Québec\n\n\n<$A> \n Good afternoon you're on C J A D\n\n<$E>  I agree a hundred percent with Guy, Bertrand's case\n the defense\n\nthat   uh  the   Québec Government    is putting   on is rather stupid and it's    going to   backfire  against them \n going to ask to uh\n\nindemnify   uh  every federalist in\n\nQuébec   for a hundred thousand dollars\n\n\n  going to   call, both Parizeau   he's thinking of\n\ncalling both Parizeau,   uh  and   Bouchard \n\n, to testify because they said    they're really not   threatening\n\nuh a new referendum\n\n<$A>  telling\n\n \n\n<$E> \n\ntotally\n\n\n<$A>  a fifty percent\n\nplus one   uh  is   okay for sovereignty uhm to\n\nAmerican television that's what they're saying and then in court they're uh\n\nsaying    the   exact opposite  I>\n\n<$B> \n\ntechnically  I'm for the Yes or for the No but for such ridiculous\n\nreasons that everybody understands that\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  the right\n\nthe freedom of   expression to express  that opinion\n\n<$B> \n what I'm saying\n\n<$A>  Yup\n\n<$B>  On the one hand you shouldn't force ah Parizeau and Bouchard\n\nto spend their money on them but on the other hand it's totally legitimate in\n\na democracy, to prevent somebody from having  \n\n a say  \n So the best solution, is to allow groups outside the umbrella\n\ncommittee, to speak independently as long as the money is raised uh \n\n uhh  within   the limits\n\n<$A>  So the government's primary argument is that this is the only\n\nfeasible method of keeping spending, under

get kids\n\nout to the ball game\n\n<$B>  Well uhm, the key is publicity I mean uh we believe that uh\n\n<,> with the help of the media we'll get quite a few out uhn large numbers uh\n we're going after the corporations to buy blocks of seats uhn large\n\nnumber of blocks of seats uh, for our kids charities and our\n\nunderprivileged  organizations that are in and around Montreal so\n\nwe're very confident that with media support uh corporations will uh will\n\ndonate heavily\n\n<$A> \n\nto   to   try to buy these blocks of tickets\n\n<$B>  Well, again, publicity uh widespread exposure the uh,\n\nthe stadium scoreboard will offer publicity uh   radio  TV\n\nnewspapers\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Do they get a tax write-off\n\n<$B>  they will, absolutely uhm\n uh organization any non-profit\n\norganization    can   get a uh tax receipt\n the organization that they're buying\n\nthe ticket for is non-profit they will get a tax receipt\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  occurs to me that uhm\n\nthat    if   you know   \n\nthese are   hard times for the Expos that this is a way of shoring up\n\ntheir good fortunes I    suppose   \n\n<$B>  Uh no doubt about that, but uh we're you know we're looking\n\nat this from a different angle actually\n\n<$A>  Okay that's not your concern\n when\n\n  when   certainly in mid-week games the Expos have uh plenty\n\nof seats open uh whether you might approach the team for them to donate uh\n\ntickets for various organizations as well\n\n<$B>  Uh absolutely\n they have agreed uh they already have a plan set up where uh any\n\ncharitable organization that buys a ticket, is donated a couple of dollars\n\nuh from the Expos   X \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  So they do receive uh a couple of dollars so the Expos are\n\ndoing already quite a lot in that regard they have been for years and uh and\n\nthey have    their   own foundation set up,\n\nthrough Bronfman  that uh issues tickets, to\n\n organizations so what we're doing is  a  little\n\ndifferent in that we're    asking   corporations to\n\nbuy seats so it's more revenue generating\n\n<$A>  are\n\nuh are things at right now\n Have you got companies on board at this point\n\n<$B>  Uh at the moment it's word of mouth uh, my own contacts\n\nthat I have uh\n There are a lot of uhm people out there volunteers and so on that\n\nthat are spreading the word

from the team as well\n\nwhen you mentioned the business    of   flashing\n\nthings up on the board uhm    it   suggests that\n\nyou've got the team on board for this\n\n<$B>  Brochu uh responded\n\nvery favourably uh to it and uh he's given me uh his full support, in that\n\nuh, you know for  your  for publicity uh in the    scoreboard   on the scoreboard and uh as well    there are   uh, media logos that uh could be\n\nused for upcoming promotions and special events uh maybe not this year but\n\ncertainly next year and we are looking to, get it started this year at\n\nleast uh\n\n\nobjections  we come up with but   it's full-fledged   we\n\nhope to have it in operation full-fledged     \n\nnext season   \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay what brought you to this project\n Are you just a big baseball fan or what was your interest in doing\n\nthis\n\n<$B>  Well uhm I was having a haircut one day actually and I asked\n\nthe hairdresser if uh he was a baseball fan and his answer was that he really\n\ndidn't care much for it didn't really understand it all that much uh the game\n\nwas too slow for him et cetera he probably would never go to a game\n But what was strange is, he still has a very vivid and fond\n\nmemory of the great, time he had      as a \n\n boy scout   when he went uh to an Expos game with a group of uh\n\nother Boy Scouts\n And they all brought their gloves and they sat in the furthest\n\nseats and he still talks about that and he goes  that was, the time\n\nof my life \n So that was when I started to realize that you know this game is uh\n\nis very much uh a kid's game and we should remember that\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  have certain\n\ncharitable organizations    that you've  \n\nalready linked up with or non-profit organizations    or\n\n  how would you tap into    those   kids\n\n   who   could benefit from going to a baseball\n\ngame\n\n<$B> \n\nwe're   we're   specifically looking at the underprivileged\n\nyouth, here in Montreal so we'll probably go after ah ah, some of the\n\nbigger names    that   everyone knows  them\n\n   but    Star Teens  for example\n But we haven't approached anybody yet we are right now at the stage\n\nof uh of getting the media to get on board\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Yes you have and thank you very much\n\n<$A> \n\ncertainly a very uh noble effort on your part\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  I appreciate it\n Thank you for giving us uh the airtime\n\n<$A>  No sweat\n\n\nJohn Keenan  he's coordinator of  Take Me Out to the Ball Game\n\n and that's a programme that   \n\nor aims to get   underprivileged kids out to see the Expos \n\n\n\n<$A>  Well, no one wants to think about dying but preparing for\n\nthat    ah eventuality   I should say,\n\ncertainly saves a family and friends a lot of confusion and frustration\n People who prepare a proper will tend to minimize the conflicts\n\nthat can arise after their death and sometimes split up families\n Joining me now to talk about what people should know before writing\n\na will is  Georges Arnaud \n He's a lawyer who specializes in estate tax planning\n Good morning\n\n<$B>  Good morning\n\n<$A>  think for most of us\n\n<,> particularly if we're young, we're thinking that this is something way\n\noff, on the horizon\n um at what point should we consider writing up a will\n\n<$B>  Well I think the first thing to do is to uh make a global\n\ninventory of the assets that you might leave after death,\n\n\n  uh is   the following \n They would take for granted that the day before your death you\n\nwould have sold all of your assets\n That is called the Deemed Disposition\n sanction from\n\nthe income tax law\n It's both for federal and provincial tax law\n So what you have to, take into consideration is the kind of\n\nassets that you are leaving,\n retirement savings\n\nplan  for example, uhm the R S P    would be\n\n  deemed to be disposed of, which means that it's like if today\n\nyou were withdrawing all of your <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A>  Gee\n\n<$B>  So what it means is that this would be considered as, a\n\nsalary and it would be added to all other incomes during the same year\n If someone leaves like I don't know like for\n\nexample an hundred thousand dollars  of R S\n\nPs or pension plan, or both, ah that would be considered as being\n\nincome plus what, what has been earned during the same year\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nthey may   they may   have more of an estate than they think\n\nof, because we're not thinking about things like R S Ps  \n\n<$B>  Yeah sure\n I mean uh you could have like uh pension or sometimes you know\n\npeople    would be uh   leaving a company\n\nand would have some kind of compensation and that could be roll-overed  into the R S Ps\n\n<$A>  Mmm\n\n<$B>  brings a lot of money at\n\nthe end\n that that could be taxable at least at fifty\n\npercent\n So meaning that's fifty thousand dollars goes to the government and\n\nthe other portion to whoever is concerned\n\n\nprovision in your will for that   like \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  proper do\n\nyou have to be in drawing up a will\n I mean you hear of people making sort of scribbled notes on paper\n\n\n<$B>  Well, any written document, uh draft by the person\n\nitself\n\n\n you   have like three kind of will that could be uh drafted\n You have the autographed will, which is a will that could be\n\ndrafted by the person\n You don't need any witnesses for that\n It has to be dated and signed and all, with the handwriting of\n\nthe person\n\n<$A>  you should\n\nlet somebody know that you've done this\n\n<$B>  Well it's preferable because otherwise it could be lost or it\n\ncould be thrown away and nobody would know\n So that's the difficulty with that kind of will\n The other two kinds of will that you can have is the ah notorial\n\nwill, which is well-known in Quebec,\n But it's only for Quebec\n\n<$A>  You draw it up with a notary then\n\n<$B>  That's right\n And the other uh the other kind of will would be uh drafted and\n\nacknowledged by two witnesses\n This is the England form of will\n Which is the uh most frequent in all of the provinces and even in\n\nthe States\n\n<$A>  Hmm\n\n<$B>  kind of\n\nwill that we are drafting    with the  \n\nlawyers   here \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n know that lately I did up a\n\nwill because    I   now have young children and so\n\neven if I don't consider myself a  \n\n wealthy person   I wanted to uhm look after their care and\n\nmaintenance\n that's another aspect\n\nthat people  they    want to   consider\n You're not just, talking about what you want done with your\n\ngoods after you leave but also perhaps the care of your children\n\n<$B>  Yeah exactly\n to know\n\n  what kind of assets that you have but you also have to know,\n\nwhat kind of protection you    want to   leave\n\nfor the beneficiaries\n\n\nchildren for example,\n You could have, like a trust created in your will, so that\n\nthe money will be administered till they reach a certain age, under which\n\nthey should receive all of the assets or a portion of the assets\n Uh you have two aspects in it,\n You have a protection, against themselves, and you also have\n\na protection in term of access also\n of uh\n\n  of trust     that <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$A>  You say protecting against themselves making sure they\n\n   don't   burn through all their money    between   age eighteen and twenty sort of  \n\nthing   \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n\nto       to   look at  \n\nwhen drawing up a will\n\n<$B> \n\nconsider,    the kind   of taxes that they\n\nwould have because they don't   know  the specificities    in   term of taxes\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Whether there's a difference if you leave it to your spouse\n\nor your children   for example hmm \n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n leave a portion to X and a portion to Y, but it might be preferable\n\nto, go, by a certain way or give certain, specific assets to a\n\ncertain person because that would be tax free and    in the\n\n  other case it wouldn't be,", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '10008d0e-82a5-4fea-9664-9fdad258c2a9', 'added':

the time including Tony Bennett and Sinatra and,\n\nand a plethora of those kinds of singers\n uh also the Joe Williams and\n\nthe Sarah Vaughns and the Ella Fitzgeralds\n the\n\nquartets the quintets the Dave Brubecks the uh Coltranes and, Miles Davis\n\nso on and so forth\n\n\n with uh a lot of    that   kind of music\n So it was in my blood and it really stirred me because it was\n\nalways challenging to play, and challenging to really appreciate\n\n<$A>  Uhm\n Tell me about the pieces falling into place, to make the album\n\nhappen after all these years of having it ruminate up here\n\n<$B>  make\n\na place for art\n Art doesn't happen on its own\n You have to clear the path, with a machete\n Especially if you want\n\nto   get it out there to the public\n It has to be a

you\n\n\n<$B> \n I think uh a growing feeling of malaise within myself\n\n\n uh popular music and that it was very repetitive\n stretch myself to\n\nchallenge myself both lyrically and vocally and\n And, put a real good jazz group together and uh\n\n\n just that\n And it was a hell of a time\n I felt like a kid again\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  Was it a little scary walking into the

to be\n\ndoing\n What I wanted to be doing\n\n<$A>  Hmm\n ask you about\n\nshifting gears uh in the type of music you would be recording   and\n\nwhether that would be \n\n<$B>  uh psychologically\n\nemotionally, maybe, a good five or six years ago\n\n<$A>  Uhm hmm\n\n<$B>  After the recording of the last album uh the Inconsolable Man\n\nalbum\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  just didn't really want to\n\nrecord pop albums anymore\n I just had no interest\n turned thirty-eight thirty-nine\n\nat the time and\n it is just you know\n\nbiological\n Maybe it's a midlife music crisis\n I don't know\n\n\n who's   asked himself the same questions at late thirties or\n\nearly forties\n uh\n\nthe   terrific uh finiteness to everything\n\n\ndo what I really    want to   I've    got to   get to it\n\n<$A>  Hmm\n\n<$B>  And that was it\n\n<$A> \n\n halfway point where uh\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  then I uh\n I'm enjoying it thoroughly because it's again it's a challenge for\n\nme and    to   broaden myself harmonically uh\n\nrhythmically vocally lyrically and uh\n I can't think of a better medium to do it in\n\n<$A>  uh the\n\natmosphere in studio\n Uh you said yourself you didn't want to create a nostalgia album\n\n  in the uh  you know Natalie Cole did\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Ah it was great\n\n\n<$A>  It's a great album but it was a nostalgia album\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A> \n\n sense of uh atmosphere you wanted to create in the studio    with   uh   a classic jazz album \n\n<$B> \n Well you get musicians who are aware of that era of music that can\n\nplay you know the Miles classics    and   all the\n\nclassics written by Cole Porter and so on and so forth\n And the guys who can go the modal way like Coltrane did in Love\n\nSupreme\n And guys who are very advanced you know musically\n But then you get the same guys who are very well aware of pop\n\nmusic and who have a pop sensibility because they're younger people, who\n\ngrew up with the Beatles and so on and so forth as we did\n So that combination's a very very difficult combination to find\n\nbut when you do    find it you   can find\n\nsome real magic because you know exactly how    to  \n\ntake and leave what's been done before\n And to change it and twist it\n And to redefine it\n And to re-colour it\n on\n\n  this album\n is\n\n  from a genre of music with with the sweeping brushes and some of\n\nthe chord changes\n\n\nand   put  em   them    \n\n on another   level other than just a uh, you know crooning\n\nballad\n And lyrically I decided to make you know the uh what would be\n\neasily a swoon song about you know a love affair\n I didn't want to fall to such you know clichés\n wanted to write you know about one\n\nof my favourite poets that ever lived and his name is Walt Whitman\n\n<$A>  Uhm Hmm\n\n<$B>  And I was going through also a spiritual or emotional crisis\n\nwith my belief system and my    what I   had\n\nfaith or lost faith in\n And I found him to be you know very comforting\n And I found him to be one of the anchors, that I anchored to in\n\nthat time, period\n what better topic\n\n  to write about\n\n\nand   twisting it and letting it bloom and letting it go to different\n\nplaces, this is what this album's all about\n\n<$A>  Tell me about working with your brother Joe\n You guys work very closely together\n\n\nworking  with you as well\n about your\n\nrelationship    with   Joe and recording and \n\n working in the studio \n\n<$B>  because\n\nI moved to Portland Oregon   and Joe  decided to stay in\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  most of the\n\nproduction on this album\n\n\n I   was used to being with Joe\n But it ended up being that Joe worked a lot on the album anyway\n worked uh\n He did a lot of the

\n\n<$B> \n\n  with    my brother helping me\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  really relied upon uh some\n\nother people uhm to help me through it\n Uh I hired a vocal coach to help me through some of the vocals\n

blow it\n I used too much voice too much passion to the point where I was\n\njust killing it\n And then I'd go back the other way and it was too flaccid\n really got me through it\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n One of them was I Die a Little More Each Day\n It was a very difficult song to sing because of the content of the\n\nlyric\n Each line\n the black drums leaking in their\n\ngraves \n\n It's very difficult to sing that\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Yeah you can get\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  want\n\nto pull back but\n He came up with a lot of good uhm, good hints\n He told me every line has to have its own colour\n Because the melody is somewhat repetitive and the things that's\n\nreally changing the colour are the lyrics so you have to go with the lyric\n and\n\n  uh    his   attention   \n\nto   detail really paid off\n\n<$A>  it a matter of concentration\n\ntoo\n\n<$B>  Well it's also a matter of paying attention\n And a matter of getting in tune with what you're really trying to\n\nsay\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  I wrote Die a Little More Each Day two three years ago\n And I believe if I would have done a vocal right there I probably\n\nwould have had it\n\n\n I forgot to tap into   that emotion\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  I didn't know what it was anymore\n nice lyric here\n\nwas written\n And it was time to do a vocal\n the\n\nemotion \n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B>  finally going\n\ninto it and into it and into it\n I remember when I finally got the vocal\n I tapped into it and I felt it again\n My heart started palpitating and I started feeling like, I\n\nreally feel this pain\n And I really do feel that because these things are done to\n\nourselves and to earth and so on and so forth    I  \n\nreally do feel the ache\n\n<$A>  Hmm\n\n<$B>  And then the vocal

right\n\n<$B>  night,\n\nbasically, where    I think I'd   like to\n\ncommunicate to people on a different level than I have in the past\n On a very personal level\n\n\n to sing the   melodies to show them the melodies, without much\n\nproduction at all\n\n\n see some of the or hear some of the changes I've been through as a\n\nperson or, as someone they've maybe followed for a few years\n And to

and it's been a hell of a lot of fun\n\n<$A>  uhm in\n\n  Fallen in Love\n That's not you obviously\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n How'd you get him to do that\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  Well he wanted to hear the tape\n And I said uhm\n came about in the studio\n originally a drum\n\nsolo\n And because we were trying to think of unique ideas uh I said to\n\nmyself uh\n Someone mentioned that it reminded them of a Fred Astaire type\n\ntrack\n Something you know, a modernized thirties or forties song\n I said uhm how about a tap solo\n I said well who better Gregory Hines\n So I got my manager to call his agent\n home\n\nnumber\n I called him and I said, it was me and I said would you like to\n\ndo a tap solo\n And he said send me a tape\n I sent him a tape\n\n\n<$A>  All right\n\n<$B>  And so we uh\n I went to L A cos he was going to be in L A in a few weeks,\n\nfrom that time\n a\n\n uh  a   stage\n Two four by eight plywoods nailed together on two by fours\n Threw a little sand on it\n go\n\nGregory  \n\n<$A> \n Must have been fun to watch\n\n<$B>  It was\n it\n It was fun\n\n<$A>  Well thanks a lot for coming in\n Welcome home back home and uh\n Looking forward to seeing you uh at the jazz festival\n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n<$A>  Well for the past few summers Montrealers have been strapping\n\non the wheels, and taking off to the nearest bike path or park,\n\nrollerblading\n In-line skating if you like\n It's getting more and more popular every year\n As you probably heard last week the city of Montreal loosened its\n\nrules just a little\n Blades are now allowed on bike paths and in some parks\n Today we're going to talk about safety etiquette and of course,\n\nparamount we're going to talk about fun\n is a blader\n He also owns a store that sells rollerblades, and he joins me\n\nin the studio now\n Hi\n Welcome to the program\n\n<$B>  Thanks\n\n<$A>  It's also changed the sound, of street hockey, too\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  uh sound of street\n\nhockey is the sound of boots or running shoes clapping against the sidewalk\n Now of course it's the sound of\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n  they are playing   on rollerblades\n\n<$B>  Yeah I'm doing the same thing\n I've got a bunch of friends who uh all converted the same way\n We play in a local school yard\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  And uh there's the sound of scraping knees too occasionally\n\n<,> and the occasional yelp but that's about it\n\n<$A>  Are shin guards essential\n\n<$B>  Uh not essential\n It depends how you're playing\n It's the same thing with shinny when you're playing hockey in\n\nwinter\n\n<$A>  get\n\nknocked down anyway\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A> \n I'm sure it's not just me who's noticing this but it seems to be a\n\nquantum leap in the number of people    roller blading\n\n  each year\n I was out at the old port and my gosh they're everywhere\n\n<$B>  Yup\n It's seems like in Montreal over the past couple of years it's\n\nalmost doubled\n sales year to year have been\n\ntwice as great as they were the year before\n\n<$A>  That much eh\n\n<$B>  So yeah even last summer you're looking at a thirty percent\n\nincrease in the number of people on the streets who are blading and they're\n\nanticipating the same thing if not more, for this summer so\n\n<$A>  Holy mackerel\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  What are the age groups\n\n \n seeing uh uh uh\n Actually I'm seeing all ages\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A> \n\n most popular\n\n<$B>  Well our store tends to uh focus on the freestyle aspect\n We've got a lot of teenagers who come into our store for\n\nsnowboards and stuff\n\n<$A>  Uhm hmm\n\n<$B>  And our focus uh actually has gone a lot broader because the\n\nsport hits everyone\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n Can you\n\n<$B> \n\n  them  \n They come with two sizes uh two size booties for the insides\n They'll last longer stuff like that\n And my father actually, is the person I've longest known to be\n\na blader, or uh in-line skater and he's been doing it for at least fifteen\n\nyears now\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  He bought his blades way back in the seventies\n\n\n<$A>  be\n\n \n\n<$A>  He's a real pioneer isn't he\n\n \n be indelicate\n\nand ask how old he is but uh needless to say uh   he's not a kid \n\n<$B> ,\n\n    sexagenarian    or something like that\n\n\n<$A>  He's been around for a few decades\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  What does he love so much about it\n\n<$B>  Uh I think he likes the exercise the smoothness of it the\n\nless impact uh related problems   the knees and back than running \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  And you go faster\n It's just the thrill of a little bit of speed without you know\n Unlike a bike you don't need miles and miles to go\n A couple of miles and you get a good workout, but you get the\n\nsensation of going a little bit faster than   you are     when you're   walking\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n  it   struck me last summer was the idea of being able\n\nto\n Imagine this is like to me a Quebec dream\n The streets freeze, but it's warm and you can use your skates\n\nall summer long and go anywhere and\n\n<$A>  So they are they really are a natural extension of us\n\n<$B>

that's quite a warning\n Thank you very much\n\n<$B>  You're welcome\n is a lawyer who specializes in estate tax\n\nplanning drawing up wills and such \n\n\n\n<$A>  It's just sixteen minutes now before eight o'clock here on\n\nDaybreak\n Well you've seen them in the gym before, their faces are\n\nscrunched up in pain and they're dripping with sweat, they're obsessed\n\nwith counting reps and sets and, they rush to book their time on the\n\nstairmaster\n For these people exercise is a science\n It's about burning fat and developing that perfect body, but\n\nMontreal sports psychologist  Tim Savage  says they're taking the\n\nwrong approach\n He's written a book called The Exercise Habit, and he says\n\nexercise not only gets us in shape physically but also mentally\n He joins me now\n Good morning\n are you there\n Oh! hang on\n in just a moment\n\n\nthis   will help us mentally and    even\n\n  physically if you're    going to   be\n\ngoing out there jogging\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  Well I spoke a little earlier about those people, in pain\n\ndripping as they exercise in the gym\n\n\nTim Savage  who says    that's   the wrong\n\napproach\n Don't think about calories and, building the perfect body\n He's written a book called The Exercise Habit and uh talks about as\n\nmuch uh the importance of getting mentally fit as physically fit\n And he joins me now\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Ahh so what does exercise do for us mentally\n\n<$B>  is no\n\ndifferent from many of the other things that we do in life that it has all of\n\nthe potential for satisfying a wide variety of our needs including, the\n\nneed for uh sociability meaning playfulness ah challenge competition et\n\ncetera\n\n\nmajor problems I see with the exercise world as it exists today is that it is\n\ntoo narrowly focused on uh body motives that uh we look at it as something\n\nthat we, take on in order to, change our bodies or to, perhaps deal\n\nwith a health problem but I think that uh for a lot of people  \n\n it   has to do with uh attaining some ideal, physical shape or\n\nlosing weight, and as such it becomes uhm a limited, uh application of\n\nexercise where people will uh try to put their mind into neutral or distract\n\nthemselves by reading or talking to someone\n\n<$A>  get over\n\n  with as soon as possible   sort of\n the pain\n\n<$B> \n\n horrible\n gym where I listen to\n\npeople in the locker room and, I remember one fellow saying  ah you\n\nknow    I   come here every day and I hate it\n\n      but      I have   to do it \n And I think wow what an attitude\n And what are you building into your experience by every day doing\n\nsomething for about an hour, that you   hate\n you can see that reflected\n\nin the rest of his\n attitude\n think that what we need to do is to, look at exercise as\n\nsomething that we're making a lifelong commitment to\n And that it will affect us in ah our mind and our body our spirits\n\n   and   to try to build it in more holistically\n\nrather than, focus it as something that is only going to work on our fat\n\ncells or develop    muscle   tone\n it can give us so much more\n It can, uh help to develop a sense of challenge in our lives\n It can uh introduce an element of fun and excitement\n It can, uh bring a certin kind of expressivity into how we live\n\nour lives\n can uh enable us to feel\n\nmore centered more powerful in ourselves and to look at it in terms    of   how it will help us to attain   \n\nthe   aspects or dimensions of our lives that we develop in ourselves\n\nand not\n\n\n   as a   physical thing\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Hmm mmm I imagine you get less discouraged and less likely to\n\ndrop off an exercise programme when you don't look at it   \n\nalong   those narrow lines as well\n\n<$B>  think that what happens is\n\nthat someone engages in an exercise programme with the goal of losing five\n\npounds or ten pounds, and uhm it's like the yo-yo diet   it's \n\n  the    yo-yo exercise plan where people will,\n\nexercise for a while and quit and uh then exercise again\n it becomes very aversive\n\nbecause, if each time you uh enter an exercise uh programme you do it with\n\nan attitude of  I hate this  or  this is drudgery\n\n then    it   isn't going to last and we\n\nreally need to incorporate in our lives, a lifelong plan not just\n\nsomething that is going to be a quick fix for an immediate problem\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  So how do we make it more pleasant\n Is it a matter of choosing the right exercise\n\n<$B>  partly choosing the right\n\nexercise    and   the right exercise will\n\nchange    from   time to time from year to year\n\ndepending   , on   what your needs are\n\n\n    kind of   like a bag of tricks a bag of\n\nexercises   , that   you know and that you can\n\ndo\n And uh depending on your mood depending on your needs at that\n\nparticular time you may go running you may go swimming you may    play   a game of volleyball\n You may just go for a walk you may do yoga you may do tai chi\n And all of the different exercise forms, uh will cater to\n\ndifferent needs that you have\n The other thing I think which is even far more important than that\n\nis to broaden, our notion of what exercise is\n That exercise is something that has become uhm so narrowly defined\n\nas    this   ritualistic activity that we do \n\n,  \n with our special outfits\n\n   and   it's crazy because uhm exercise really has\n\nto do with the expenditure    of   effort    and   we can do that in so many ways\n And if we take it out of the gym if we take it out of these narrow\n\nconfines then what it allows us to do is to see all of the opportunities that\n\nwe have for movement\n My father-in-law is a wonderful example\n He will go to an exercise class but when uhm, his wife asks him\n\nuh to go for a walk he won't go for a walk because, she likes to walk\n\naround and just look at things and stop and talk to people\n\n\n not   exercise   yeah   \n\nand   uh    he'll   get up and he'll\n\ndo push-ups uhm he'll do all sorts of things that are very ritualistic but in\n\nterms of just, going out    and   pushing the\n\nlawnmower around the lawn no he hires someone to do that\n I think that we need to,\n\nbring back into our lives those things that labour-saving devices have have\n\nremoved from our lives    to uh   incorporate\n\nactivities that are just uhm   uh <unclear> word </unclear> \n\nyeah\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n An interesting perspective\n\n<$B>  You're welcome\n\n<$A>

battle zone in Croatia are safely back at their base\n\n\n  Canadian   contingent based in Rastovic\n They were moved from their posts Friday by Croatian soldiers to\n\nthirty kilometres away to Zadar when it became apparent they were outnumbered\n\nand were in a battle zone\n joins us now, uhm with\n\nmore on this\n Ah good morning\n\n<$B>  Good morning\n\n<$A>  happened to\n\nthese soldiers when they were ah removed from their posts and taken to Zadar\n\n<$B>  Well ah first of all I have to correct your premise uh\n\n\n earlier that said they were returned back to Rastovic\n In fact they are still in Zadar\n\n<$A>  Uh huh\n\n<$B>  They have not gotten back\n What uh happened last night was that we had one of our resupply\n\nconvoys and some soliders who had been on uh an R and R programme out of the\n\narea uh for a little rest and relaxation, they were the ones that managed\n\nto return uh about one o'clock in the morning our time\n The forty-three soldiers are still in Zadar\n They are staying in a uh Croatian barracks uh area being very well\n\ntreated\n They were never ever uh captives in the true sense of the word or\n\nprisoners\n They were simply uhm uh once uh it was clear that uh the Croatians\n\nwere going to evict them    and in the   face of\n\nuh overwhelming odds they had no choice but to leave\n They were simply escorted out of the area uh out of the battle\n\nzone area to Zadar where they have been uh very very well treated by the\n\nCroatians and uh\n\n\ntime that is mutually convenient really that they can return back to the main\n\nbase camp in Rastovic\n\n<$A>  How gently were they escorted out of there?\n We heard they were taken out by gunpoint?\n\n<$B>  Well the confrontations that occurred in each of the\n\nobservation posts uh were basically uh soldiers coming up saying  okay\n\nyou have to leave  our soldiers saying  no  \n\n not   a chance we're not leaving  and uh at which point\n\nthe Croatians, arrived with uh an

{'text': "<$A> \n\nthat \n\n<$B> \n Skating year round\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B> \n\n them     so maybe you do know\n I mean do we do more of it here in Montreal than we do say in other\n\ncities\n done here than\n\nin say Toronto or Vancouver\n\n<$A>  Not yet actually\n The trends like all trends seem to flow out of California and then\n\non their way go to Vancouver first, Toronto next\n And last year Toronto had its big boom year according to the\n\nindustry   uh  and this year it's Montreal\n So we're a year behind\n But the thing that's different about Quebec is the enthusiasm with\n\nwhich it's been taken up\n something\n\nlike sixteen officially recognized amateur hockey leagues, uh or teams,\n\nlast year to something like two hundred in the province   registered\n\n with the association\n Yeah some enormous amount\n I don't know the exact number but it's in the hundreds\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n Yeah\n\n<$A>  And uh twenty thousand kids participating this year in the\n\nleagues\n It's really uh it's grown explosively\n\n<$B> \n\nis there a downside to growth   like that  with  people don't\n\nknow what they're doing yet\n\n<$A>  Yeah I think so\n I think the enthusiasm with the sport uhm just leads to the fact\n\nthat there's going to be thirty percent new   skaters \n When you see people skating this year, thirty percent of them\n\nwill never have been on blades before\n\n<$B>  hmm\n\n<$A>  They'll be familiar with it from having gone skating, uhm\n\non ice\n And people tend to learn it very quickly here\n\n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n<$A>  Same physical movement\n The skating going forward is no problem\n It's the braking that makes the huge difference\n People uh tend not to wear pads because you don't wear pads when\n\nyou just go skating   on ice \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And they don't learn how to brake necessarily or realize how\n\nimportant it is, that you must learn how to brake one of the first things\n\n<$B>  Yvan Cournoyer's\n\nrollerblading team uh uh the Roadrunners  uh    have they   caused this excitement\n\nor is it the other way around\n just latching\n\non to a trend do you think\n\n<$A>  it's a little\n\nbit of both\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  building up the hype about it\n And the promotion and advertising that they put together\n The very fact that it's Yvan Cournoyer probably draws a lot of\n\nattention to the sport\n Legitimizes it a lot for kids to want to participate in the summer\n Uh but other than that, and I think it's kind of reciprocal\n\n<$B> \n\nyour not involved    with   rollerblading uh eh\n\nplaying hockey\n If you want to go out there and get some exercise\n City of Montreal uh has a new policy\n People are not permitted to rollerblade where they are and where\n\nthey aren't\n And uh why don't we save them a few bucks in tickets and find out\n\nwhere they are not allowed to rollerblade\n They are allowed\n\non bicycle paths now   right\n\n<$A>  That's correct\n\n\nthey're allowed to   you're allowed to   uh do your in-line\n\nskating on bicycle paths\n\n<$B>  Any bicycle paths\n have as much\n\nright as any cyclist there\n\n<$A> \n\n From what I understand that's the case\n\n<$B>  where shouldn't you go\n\n<$A> \n Uh they don't want you to go downtown more than anything\n On busy streets they don't want you to go\n They don't want you to go, anywhere without proper protection\n\n<$B>  Uhm hmm\n\n<$A>  Uhm you can roll in the parks obviously if you don't, but\n\non the street they're definitely\n The police if they're going to stop anyone it's someone who's being\n\nreckless, who's not following uh the regular uh you know street safety\n\nrules of just you know giving the right of way to   pedestrians \n\n<$B> \n Cos technically your not out on the streets at all, are ya\n\n<$A>  Technically you're not allowed to according to I think it's\n\nQuebec law\n It would have to be changed and not municipal law that says that\n\nrollerblades uh or uh    skateboards   roller\n\nskates or in-line skates effectively are not allowed on the streets\n But uh municipal police know that they can't really do very much in\n\nterms of, people going on the streets at large\n They're going to focus on people who are causing problems more\n\n<$B> \n\n a   lot of accidents in the making what with the\n popularity of bicycles in\n\n   Montreal has   exploded in the last\n\nfifteen or twenty    years   and we know the\n\ncomplaints uh that we get uh    about   cyclists\n Now you've got the rollerbladers you got the pedestrians, you've\n\ngot obviously the motorists and you've got uh, and you've got rolle\n\nbladers\n It sounds as if, it's getting awfully crowded out there\n\n<$A>  Yeah goodness knows what else could fit on the streets\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Yeah but a couple of things come to mind though\n We need more\n I think more public access to really good routes in the city would\n\nbe a nice thing\n I mean it's a healthy thing\n There's no reason the city shouldn't encourage it, in its\n\ncitizens, or that the province shouldn't encourage this kind of athletic\n\nparticipation\n People want to use their legs and feet to transport themselves to\n\nand from work\n We can give them the way to do it safely\n promoting that kind of thing rather\n\nthan inhibiting or prohibiting   it,  because we don't\n\nunderstand or we're afraid of it or we don't have the means  \n\npresently  to deal with it\n\n<$B> \n\n\n Now goodness knows we don't need to build up another bureaucratic\n\nlevel but do you think people should get a little training before especially\n\ngoing out on the streets\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  weaving in and out of\n\nthere who should know better\n\n<$A>  Uh yeah I think that's true but uh it should be mostly coming\n\nfrom the shops\n Uh people have friends\n who's\n\nrollerblading  \n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  There're places where you can get lessons if you're not\n\nfamiliar\n You should never start off on the streets but go to a place that's\n\nflat\n A school yard, or down to the old port on a slow day not on a\n\nSaturday   or Sunday  when it's overloaded with people\n can even ask, almost any\n\nrollerblader for a little advice and they'd give it to you\n\n<$B> \n Yeah\n\n<$A>  Freely\n\n<$B> \n\nthe   bicycle path    they sound like\n\nyour   best bet because they can get you uh all over uh town\n Can you\n\n<$A>  Yeah as far as transportation goes they're your best bet\n For recreation and fun though, there's a lot of other places to\n\ngo\n\n<$B>  the\n\n  the   path not necessarily be a recreational choice\n Of course you can't do much other than go in two directions\n\n<$A>  That's it uhm for instance this weekend I went uh uh from the\n\nmountain, Jeanne Mance Park down to, the Olympic stadium, and it\n\nwas mostly for transportation because the bike path isn't that beautiful in\n\nmost of its parts along that route\n\n\nnarrow\n So they're not really designed for people on blades\n Your legs go out side to side\n Bikes oncoming bike traffic or behind you\n be careful on a\n\n  bike path <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B>  have to be careful\n cyclists uh have uh\n\nwhether  <-it's >   uh it's   fair or not have a pretty\n\nrough    reputation   in this city\n\n\nwhat   what   should you be watching for when you're on the\n\nbike paths, and you got cyclists coming both ways\n\n<$A>  look behind\n\nyou once in a while\n\n\ngotta   have got to   glide past them without actually uhm\n\nskating so that you don't draw your feet out in front of them\n\n Then otherwise, just make sure you give the right of way to\n\nthe people ahead of you\n It's the same kind of rules as driving or any sport\n Just, if someone can't see you because they're ahead of you\n\nthey've got the right of way\n Pedestrians have the right of way, and cyclists have to treat\n\nthe bladers    with the same   respect I\n\nsuppose\n\n<$B>  they\n\n\n\n<$A> \n you know\n\n\n look of curiosity but no animosity no bad words\n I haven't heard a single story to that effect really\n\n<$B> \n Okay you mentioned there are better places than the bicycle paths\n\nfor recreation\n fun,\n\nsheer fun\n\n<$A> \n It's just such a jumble of people\n There's so many people down there blading\n Uh the Lachine Canal's a beautiful path\n Parc Lafontaine is turning into a real hot spot, as well\n Lots of people there and it's a beautiful park though it\n\ndesperately needs to be repaved if anyone from the city is listening right\n\nnow \n And uh then most of the other municipal parks are really good\n Any of the paved municipal parks I'd say are the finest places to\n\ngo\n Other than that, small streets uhm in the suburbs\n\n\n If you're    going to     go against\n\n   the   provincial law as it stand   to go\n\nto the quiet  streets   in the Plateau  are wonderful\n some beautiful\n\narchitecture\n You can explore different neighbourhoods rather quickly\n Uh Old Montreal with its cobblestone streets is a place to avoid\n\n<$B> \n\n\n Uhm hmm uhm hmm\n\n<$A>  And the other thing to watch out for is a big warning to\n\nanyone who has just gotten blades who does want to, maybe venture onto the\n\nstreet is they repair the streets with this gooey tar that fills the cracks\n\nin the city, and if you're not aware of what you're doing, or where\n\nyou're going and your blades go into one of those you fall over you could\n\nreally hurt yourself\n\n<$B>  Okay and, safety as far as what you should wear\n You should have a helmet\n\n<$A>  Helmet definitely\n\n<$B>  And a bicycle helmet I hear is not good enough\n\n<$A>  when\n\n  beginners or people who are going to fall tend to fall they fall on\n\nthe backs on their backsides\n the back of the crown\n\nof your head , is what's at risk so, inline helmets    should   be more like skateboard helmets I E they should\n\ncover the back of your head\n Or if they look like bike helmets they should, come down\n\nfurther towards the back of your head\n Uh kids or anyone should also wear wrist guards\n That is the single greatest cause of injuries, people not\n\nwearing wrist guards\n\n<$B> \n uh\n\ntend to uh push your hands out   and uh  hurt your hands  \n\n<$A> \n You're going as fast as you are when you're running and suddenly\n\nyou fall\n You catch some of that gooey stuff on the street\n Down you go and your wrists are the first place to break\n Uh other than that the uh knee pads are a good thing, and\n\nespecially if you're playing some hockey or something like that\n And then elbow pads are a good idea as well\n\n\n  seem to be   less important than the other parts", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

very clear, that I have nothing to do\n\nwith  La Mouvement Impératif Fran&ccedille;ais \n I'm only a member\n And now looking back at it I can see why they invited me\n to\n\n  pretend   that the

you    Or you're among the founders     \n\nand   you didn't say no then\n We went through a number of the elements of the manifesto as\n\nreported, in  Le Devoir \n You said you were generally supportive of the manifesto, you\n\nwere aware of the manifesto\n don't quite understand this\n\nmorning you're saying you didn't have knowledge of it\n\n<$B>  s\n\n   stand   for\n Now there is positive things in there which I agree with\n I didn't\n\nsee, I didn't have that    manifesto  \n\nor,    what      what it\n\nwas  \n And like this thing about uhh uhh immigration and so on like I knew\n\nnothing about that\n agree that Quebecers have to\n\nstand up    for   what they believe in\n\n\nhave to defend ourselves too because it seems to be in this country everybody\n\nhas the right

I know\n\nI've spoke to lots of people coming from other countries and it's the federal\n\ngovernment, who've set them up to be against Quebec right from the start\n Like I don't blame them at all\n\n\n    and        I'm\n\n  against, being racist to these people\n It's not their fault\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  It's true that\n\n  very often they have an attitude but I'm not blaming it for

would be\n were\n\nuhh   wanted      to ahh   to do\n\nactions   but ahh \n\n<$A>  you weren't\n\nsuspicious that this guy was an  ex-falquist     you know \n\n<$B> \n\n was not even supposed to be there in the first place\n I didn't even know who that was\n\n\n<$A>  who approached you\n\n<$B> \n\nper    person   it's somebody from the organization but\n\nlike     will Sobonne    was not even there\n\nwhen they spoke to me\n\n\n that's   a few weeks ago\n\n<$A> \n who approached you\n\n<$B>  I didn't even know this\n\nguy was   there \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  and I\n\njust about fell off my chair\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nrefuse to support any individual    who   who does\n\nnot uh refuse violence and racism\n Because I am totally against racism\n I think it's the stupidest thing\n\n\n<$A> \n\n Mister    \n\n<$B> \n\nanything  \n done in the past we've made sure\n\nwe do it with a smile on our face\n\n\n, think violence,     \n\n it's   the worst   enemey of Quebec\n\n<$A>  thanks for talking to us again today\n\nthis morning\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Good bye\n\n<$B>  Bye bye\n\n<$A>  Mouvement\n\nImpératif Fran&ccedille;ais  of  Outaouais \n\n\n\n\n<$A>  Last week it was confirmed by the City of Montreal that three\n\nlibrary outlets would be closed in uhh Saint-Henri Little Burgundy in N D G\n\n and at the McGill Metro\n And then ahh news a little later in the week that a fourth uhh\n\nlibrary outlet would also be on the chopping block\n Well last night in N D G a group of citizens got together to\n\nprotest that decision by the City of Montreal\n was one of the people there\n She is with the Friends of Benny Library and has been involved in\n\na number of initiatives in her neighbourhood\n\n\n<$B>  Good morning\n\n<$A>  could you maybe describe the Benny\n\nlibrary for me before we get into just what you think you can do to stop the\n\nCity on this one\n what's it like\n\n<$B> \n\n a    a beautiful former chapel it's ahh part of our\n\nheritage in N D G\n Ah it it was built right after World War Two to serve the veterans\n\nthat came back from the war and uhh about ten years later I guess    there   a bigger church was built and uhh it was turned over\n\nand taken over by the city and turned into a library\n So it's been there as an institution for about forty years serving\n\nthe community\n Uhh largely the senior citizens of ahh Benny Farm right now\n the young people\n Uhh more and more the collection in the library is about seventy\n\npercent French books and thirty percent English\n\n\n  and   I do some reference work with the kids there\n It's a really homey atmosphere\n Ahh the kids lots of children from below Sherbrooke Street in the\n\n<,,> apartment complexes come and flock there after school\n It's like home you know\n\n\n on the way out\n walking into your\n\nown kitchen and the tables\n not brand new and\n\nit doesn't have all the amenities of a  maison de couture  \n But what it has is heart\n And the people there know our children by name and they can help\n\nthem with their homework\n important, place\n\nfor me especially because I've decided, to live in this society and to\n\nstay here\n And my children are both in French school\n And it might seem funny to people out there, but my eight-year\n\nold and fourteen-year old barely read English\n They need, French, culture, access\n They need services in French\n I think our city sees these books, as, this is what this is\n\n<,> a building with books\n And they don't realize that the people there who talk to my\n\nchildren in French since they've been in diapers have helped them integrate\n\n<,> into the society\n helped them be, just,\n\nlike, the little kids in their class that have been hearing French at home\n\nsince,  they came out of the womb\n\n<$A>  when\n\nwe talked to the mayor last   week  about this he said, that in\n\nthat part of the city the city was investing money in private libraries and\n\nso the population was going to be well served by library services but\n\nprimarily through the private libraries\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  do you make of that\n\n<$B>  they\n\nnamed   I made her name   the libraries because nobody could\n\ntell me which ones they were\n named two, that I'm not\n\nfamiliar with\n they might\n\n  they almost have      an accord \n\n with but they've never given them money before\n The Montreal Children's Library is located in John-Twenty-Third\n\nschool and it's in uhm a part of N D G below, uhh the tracks and so uhh in\n\nthat respect I agree that they should be because the children down there\n\ncould never, cross ahh you know you wouldn't want them crossing the tracks\n There's just not enough access points\n\n<$A> \n\n  to   do the same   thing  to get to\n\na library\n\n<$B>  the\n\nchildren's library      located in  \n\nJohn-Twenty-Third school is also, I don't want my library to become like\n\nthat because,    its   got very little\n\nservice and it doesn't have,  animé  well what they\n\ncall      animation  \n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Uhh it's a growing thing a library\n You have to keep putting money into it\n You have to keep buying books\n\n\n all the books here you know    you can  \n\ndistribute them to    the   people\n The books would die very quickly\n They'll become out of date ahh\n\n<$A> \n\n  what   do you do now\n Ahh as I understand it seventy or eighty people turned up last\n\nnight   to demand some answers \n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A>", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$A>  is of course the director of Police\n\nServices for the M U C \n joins us now\n Good morning sir\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Thanks for joining us this morning\n\n<$B>  My pleasure\n\n<$A>  a very\n\n tough week\n\n<$B> \n\n  you know it\n\n  could happen but uhh when you're the uh police chief    I think it's your   nightmare\n\nuhh and    it   happened uhh and uhh you know \n\n  we   have to overcome the situation\n But still it's kind of hard\n\n<$A> \n\nRoberta Piquard \n I see this morning some specialized police services may be being\n\ncalled on\n happening\n\n<$B>  Well you know uhuh obviously I won't talk about details but\n\n   we're   working on the case uhh trying\n\nto find uhh why uhh Constable  Piquard  was shot\n motive for\n\nuhh the shooting    you're   usually next to the uh\n\nperson    who   committed the murder\n So we're working on it right now and I wouldn't like to go in\n\ndetail   obviously uhh \n\n<$A>  could confirm or deny this but I think\n\nthe report in the Journal  this morning saying\n\nyou're trying to build up potential psychological profiles in the absense of\n\nyou know any visual identification by any witness\n That's what you're having to deal with\n\n<$B>  a science uhh\n\ndeveloped in the United States with the F B I over the last twenty years\n\ncalled profiling\n Uhh and it you know with what happened on the scene, the way the\n\nperson was shot, you can make a profile the  suspect\n\nyou're looking for\n And that's what we're going to be using uhm in a couple of days\n\n<$A>  As you know a number of questions about, the security or\n\nlack thereof around that substation\n\n\n in that substation \n\n<$B>  everyday you got over two hundred\n\npolice officers working on their own, in patrol cars, in stations,\n\nwalking the beat\n\n\n always   this potential for danger\n That you might get hit\n And that's what happened\n\n\nalone\n\n<$A>  What about things like, I mean security cameras\n That came up as well\n\n\n a dissuasive measure but in terms of trying to crack the case after the\n\nfact\n\n<$B>  But do you really think cameras are a dissuasive uhh operation\n\n\nand uhh you know people got shot\n We have cameras in uhh banks, and still they are getting robbed\n We have cameras at the casino\n Uh two days ago a person sitting at a table, decided to pull out\n\na gun    and   and make a robbery there even though\n\nthere are    plenty of cameras  \n Uhh so you know it's not a deterrent\n Uhh we have to find ways so that our people don't get shot\n And uhh it's kind of hard you know to be uhh protected uhh all the\n\ntime\n\n<$A> \n\ncos   it sounds to me like no changes in procedures for those\n\nsubstations\n\n<$B>  There won't be any changes\n uhh you know\n\nwould have said the same thing\n The key solution to problems that we have in this society,\n\nmainly violence, is to go through community policing\n if\n\nwe you know uhh   if we're   able to build bridges with the\n\ncommunity uhh these things won't happen\n you know people you\n\nknow\n Or uhh you know people around the police station will be uhh sort\n\nof a protection\n way of the\n\nfuture\n\n<$A>  I want to pick up on another story that's the news this\n\nmorning\n seems\n\nto   seem like   this initiative   \n\nhas been   very successful since you've finally got   everybody\n\ntogether  and started working together\n I mean I've had this question right through so I'm going to ask you\n\nwhy did it seem to take so long to get everybody together and working in one\n\ndirection\n\n<$B>  well mainly it's a question of budget\n I mean Wolverine is doing a great job\n It's not only to pull people together\n Uh it's a question of having the dollars\n a lot\n Uhm and we had this budget given by the Quebec government\n It made you know a big difference\n Ever since we worked\n I think the police itself has done you know a great job\n\n\njudicial system,   correctional system   will be able to\n\nfollow uhh what we are doing right now\n I mean it makes no sense if we make the arrest and people involved\n\n   in   these gangs uh get six months or a year in\n\nprison\n So uhh you know after we've done our job somebody, else has to\n\ndo theirs\n\n<$A>  Now this is supposed to be though part of the plan\n I remember Mister Menard the Minister of Public Security when he\n\nwas talking about putting this in place and finding the budget one of the\n\nthings he said was    you know we   got to make\n\nvery sure that when those people end up before a judge   \n\nthat   judge has all the information he needs to be able to make the\n\nkind of not only judgment but also the kind of sentencing that might act \n\n  as an   element\n\nin beating this thing\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  like\n\nyou're still sceptical though about the judges and their role in this\n\n<$B>  to\n\nuh   to   to inform them we need uhh the tools to be able to\n\ndo it, mainly uh prosecutors\n Uhh we're going uh through uh you know kind of budget problems\n Uhh how do we uhh make sure that we can have twenty more\n\nprosecutors to do the job\n And this is a question of money\n\n\nin   Quebec City \n\n<$A>  I wanted to get some of your thoughts\n\non the uhh the big announcement yesterday by a number of ministers of various\n\nministries uhh here in Quebec about, measures designed to prevent\n\nconjugal   violence \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And there's a whole array of things that were there from each\n\nof these ministries\n One of the major ones though seems to be just trying to make sure\n\n   the\n\ninformation   flows   \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  that\n\n  his spouse who's a potential target of violence is informed\n\n\nthe local police   gets the information into their computers quickly\n\nso that the man or woman on the street in the car can you know punch it up\n\nright away\n do you think of some of these\n\nthings that    were   announced yesterday\n about this whole problem\n Cos it's huge\n I mean just this past week what four women found killed\n\n<$B>  first comment is, at last\n a long time\n Uhh the M U C police has had a program like that for a over a year\n\n\nParajustice  uh and they're informing uhh women that their uhh\n\nhusband uhh is getting out\n Uhh and we're working with the victims\n had that for a year\n\nnow\n So it's working pretty good\n\n<$A>  How does that system work\n soon as someone is to be\n\nreleased for whatever reason there's an immediate contact with the person\n\n<$B>  Before the person is released, there's a call uhh to the\n\nvictim saying    within   an hour the uhh\n\nperson involved in your incident will be freed    the \n\n person is getting out\n Uhh is everything alright\n They're working with the person, helping them to find solutions\n\nto the problem\n If the problem is security we might find a place for them\n And help them to go through this nightmare\n\n<$A> \n\ncontact people in both directions\n a problem arises from the\n\nside of the woman or the citizen they can get in touch with them\n\n<$B>  That's it\n That's what was missing before\n\n<$A>  I mean cos\n\none of the things   Mister Menard spoke about yesterday was the\n\ndelays that often happen\n if it's known it\n\ndoesn't necessarily get into the computer so that maybe somebody knows but\n\neverybody doesn't know\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nthose   those   little onboard computers I see your folks\n\ntapping into all the time\n\n<$B>  Well their job uhh with this program\n\n     the   police officers involved \n\n their job is to uh make sure the victim is well-secured\n And the victim, knows what's happening\n And uhh you know we're there to help\n And that's the uh the main change\n involved in the case\n\nand we know what uh people are going through\n So we're trying to help them uh you know try to find solutions\n\n<$A>  Mister Menard also seemed to talk in terms of uh really,\n\ntargeting those responsible for the violence\n I\n\nmean on a charge linked directly to the violence   but if you can get\n\nem on anything else whether it's firearms possession or weapons possession or\n\njust like anything, you slap with it\n that your approach as well\n\n<$B>  Uhh I fully agree with that\n I mean uhh violence uh should not be a part of what's happening in\n\nour society\n I mean too often, and it's too bad people solve their problems\n\nwith violence\n And it's not only adults, kids do it\n So uh uh together we have to find solutions\n And I think the uh proposition uh given yesterday is one uh step\n\nin a good direction\n\n<$A>  Just a little bit of a budget from that ministry for these\n\nthings\n Fifty thousand dollars I think it is for training\n\n\n   sensitivity   training I guess you'd say,\n\nfor officers in this whole field of conjugal violence\n Where do you think you are with your force on that issue\n\n<$B> \n\n  it shouldn't stop us from you know taking care of\n\nvictims  \n\n\nto get   the information\n What's happening, what will happen to me\n And and I think we're answering these questions right now\n\n<$A>  and as I\n\nsay   there were a number of ministers involved in that press\n\nconference yesterday\n\n\ntalking about ahh special budgets for support services uhh the Minister of\n\nEducation talking about you know some getting at the uhh roots  of\n\nviolence as well\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  How optimistic are you about these kind of initiatives\n\n\n pessimistic    and I'm sure especially you see the kinds of\n\nthings you see\n it's especially easy to be cynical and\n\npessimistic\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nhow   reasonably    how reasonably  \n\noptimistic can we be   about this \n\n<$B>  you\n\nknow, it's not only a question of procedures it's a question of caring for\n\nvictims\n change in attitudes\n If we change the attitude\n you're a police officer and\n\nyou're dealing, only this case and you know it's for you only a case well\n\n   we won't   be able to solve the uhh \n\n  the   whole problem\n\n\n  the victim is facing this problem  \n\nand you are there to care for the victim, you will find solutions",

young people for almost a decade now\n You must have been very young\n Including troubled teens and autistic children\n Elana's going to join me today to talk about some of her\n\nexperiences with kids and uh tell me more about her music, as well\n Hi\n Welcome to the program\n\n<$B>  Thank you\n\n<$A>  Good to meet you\n Uh now you work with teens\n at an outdoor,\n\nconcert\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  turned into a\n\njob\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Uhm I would volunteer my time for this outdoor concert uh for\n\nkids in park extension\n\n<$A>  Uhm hmm\n\n<$B>  And they do it every year\n it's ongoing even now\n who of\n\ncourse is involved in that program uh saw me there and decided that I would\n\nbe an asset to the youth centre that was already in existence\n Uhm got me coded as a specialist and I started working with those\n\nkids on a very limited scale\n\n<$A> \n\n body language during the concert\n know how to work an\n\naudience well or what\n\n<$B>  Fairly well\n respond well\n\nto my music\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  you know all the\n\n  production aspect of it so\n And I started working with these kids and teaching them, the\n\nbasics of guitar and vocals\n Working with them developing rap music with them\n Which was really something, for me\n That was uh\n\n<$A> \n\n\n not  \n\n\n<$B> \n Let's just say that I don't write it very easily and to bring in a\n\nvery large amplifier and a drum machine and a keyboard and a this and a that\n\nand a,\n The noise levels were a little extreme when you're working with\n\ntwenty kids at a time who are asking you twenty different questions plus the\n\nsound plus the\n It was quite the experience\n\n<$A>  It was spinning huh\n\n<$B> \n\n\n  made   good money off me that year and uh\n\n<$A>  It was the way\n\nthey wanted to express themselves \n\n<$B>  Yeah it was, and that's exactly what you have to do\n\n \n It's their music of choice\n That's what you go for\n\n<$A>  Tell me about the first experience with them, because these\n\nwere kids who probably don't have a very    happy  \n\nhome life, if any home life at all right\n\n<$B>  Some of them don't\n come\n\nfrom uh single parent families\n\n\n Some of them are involved in some type of gang  \n Most of them or some of them have been exposed to that milieu so\n\nthey have a very different outlook than I do\n way that they judge their\n\npeers, the way they judge their accomplishments is completely different\n\nfrom mine\n But I learned a lot about them\n\n\n  if they stayed   out of trouble it was\n\nsomething\n If they finished school it was something\n If they, uh went on to do something bigger and better it was\n\nsomething\n If they had a good day some of them it was something\n There were times when I was really scared\n Most of the time it was just great\n\n<$A>  What scared you\n the lives they had\n\nto lead,   scared you \n\n<$B> , most of the time it was things that\n\nhappened that would scare me\n Like when the police raided the centre and this weapon came in uh\n\n  that was pretty scary \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Uh other things, some of them were uh holding weapons of\n\nsome type\n So either in a bag or in a pocket whatever\n When you found out they were there, with these weapons it became\n\nsometimes, sometimes the potential of a situation\n You had to handle it\n\n<$A>  Uhm hmm\n\n<$B>  These were things I mean\n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n<$B>  knives and in the guns and in the whatever\n\nelse happened to be around and in the <unclear> word </unclear> chains and\n It really wasn't all the time though\n It was just there were enough events that would happen, that you\n\nwere very aware of what was going on out there\n And that's uh\n\n<$A> \n\nand   I\n your own\n\n  personal safety but I mean do you think these kids  \n\n are   just trouble makers    or  \n\nthey're dealing with the situation    the only\n\nway they know how   to deal with it\n I gather some of these kids were just protecting themselves in the\n\nmilieu they live in right\n\n<$B> \n That's pretty much it\n some of the kids get in there and they do\n\nit for social reasons and emotional reasons\n that's\n\n  that's   how they do\n And that's what's available to them\n a home\n\nlife\n Some of them uhm have gone through some abuse at home\n\n<$A> \n Yeah\n\n<$B>  they\n\nget into and    your   job was to try and get them\n\nout\n Other kids were just trying to exist, you know in the milieu\n\nthey were\n And again it's not all the kids\n you know every day\n But it was something that I'd never seen before\n I'd never been involved in that before\n I'd lived in another, suburb\n I had lived in, like I don't know Snowden where in my childhood\n\nit was fairly quiet\n wasn't really rough\n\n<$A> \n So why didn't it spook you completely and say now I've got to find\n\nanother line of work\n What was it about the kids\n\n<$B>  They were just great kids\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B> \n\nrap\n They do rap shows now and this concert stuff and, when the kid\n\nfinally sits down and talks to you    and   you can\n\nyou know lend a hand    and  \n Even now there's like four or five kids that still call my house\n\nand let me know what they're doing and, I'm very proud of some of them\n to do lovely and wonderful things\n\n<$A> \n did you gain their trust\n\n<,> and get them to open up\n I would imagine a lot of them to be pretty unresponsive to begin\n\nwith and tell you to, get lost at first\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Well I have a list of other words here but I\n\ncan't use any of them \n\n<$B>  I think what you have to do with adolescents is you really\n\nhave to wait and be patient\n You have to listen to them\n Uhm not judge them\n Not give them the spiel that they get, or they might get from\n\nsomebody else\n or uhm you know\n\n I think you should be doing this \n It takes a little longer uh with an adolescent\n\n\nto open up and they learn to relax and    then  \n\nthat's it\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  Then you're there\n And then you have to take responsibility for what you're doing\n Cos at that point, if you\n\n\nyou're   you're   hurting them more than your helping them\n Hence I still get phone calls and\n I'm still pretty much involved and life goes on with my\n\nadolescents at the Y\n Park-Extension, a Montreal\n\nneighbourhood \n There's some kids I still speak to\n\n<$A>  And I gather music must have been a great key to open a door\n\n\ngather it is right\n\n<$B> \n good introduction\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  It's a good first step\n when adolescents\n\n  that they really I don't know whether they glorify this industry\n\nwhich is fine\n And everybody wants to be a guitarist and play guitar and be a\n\nrock star or a rap star or   some type of musical \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Uhm when they see you and they see you perform and if you do\n\nit fairly well and    you   share with them,\n\nthen at that point they feel like they are able to talk to you\n They're able to reach out to you\n You become familiar\n You become accessible\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  That's it\n Well it's a first step\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  And then you have to carry it from there\n\n<$A>  can't be afraid\n\nthat    one   of these days one of these kids is\n\ngoing to go away and not come back\n I guess you've got to expect that right\n\n<$B>  It happens\n\n<$A>  You have to wait as you say and be patient and hope\n\n<$B>  That's right\n\n<$A>  Uhm now dealing with these kids\n knew how to\n\ndeal with kids with real problems\n were well physical as\n\nwell as emotional\n But you dealt with autistic children\n Much younger but again still somebody you had to reach in order to\n\nbring them out\n\n<$B>  Do you see the trend somewhere\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Yeah I

getting into it\n And big big eyes and, big smile\n And especially if it's a kid who has, some problems\n\ncommunicating or some problems with comprehension, it really is something\n\n<$A>  Hmmm\n

Bye bye\n with the friends of Benny Library\n\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  What do the scientists hope will happen later today\n\n<$B>  They're hoping that the spacecraft will\n\nsurvive\n That it will make the plunge into Jupiter\n It's coming in like a comet\n\n\n temperatures\n Uh the heat of friction as it slows down incredible forces uh\n\nacting on it\n Then they're hoping that the parachute will open, the\n\ninstruments will work and we'll begin to get data\n They're also hoping that the second part of the Galileo spacecraft\n\nwill put itself into orbit where it will remain for the next two years\n\n<$A>  And what are they hoping to find out\n\n<$B>  This is the first time that a spacecraft has ever, touched\n\n<,>    one of what are called  \n\nthe gas giant planets\n Jupiter is more like a star then a planet\n It's made of hydrogen and helium\n The same stuff as the sun\n And because of that, they are hoping they're able to see a piece\n\nof what the solar system used to look like\n Jupiter hasn't changed in over four billion years\n It's still made of the same primordial material that the entire\n\nsolar system, including the earth was made of and because its so primative\n\nthat in a way looking at Jupiter is like looking back in time\n\n\n\n\n<$B> \n\nour soldiers were going to defend that position it would be totally untenable\n They would not have been able to do it\n So after some uh fairly stubborn resistance and some heated\n\nconversation and debate uh orders were issued by the commander, that uh\n\nthey were to leave with the uh Croatian soldiers\n think\n\nthe tune would've been different uh but uh there was no point in the face of\n\nthe overwhelming odds    to   stay there uhm any\n\nlonger so they were forced to leave\n\n<$A>  the\n\nnegotiations are well under way though to get them to Rastovic?\n\n<$B>  Yes it's not really negotiation it's simply a question uh\n There're still uh a lot of Croatian troops moving in the area\n\nobviously they wish to control the roads\n So it's more a question of scheduling uh to get them through\n uh if you're owning the\n\nbattlefield which the Croatians do,   you just don't want uhm you\n\nknow unknown groups of people travelling around in vehicles\n\n<$A>  Is there a danger in going through that area?\n\n<$B>  Not at this stage\n\n\nthey are   in, the Bankovac uh town of Bankovac which is about\n\nfour kilometres from Rastovic which was a Serbian stronghold\n Uh we see now uh Croatian civilians who had lived originally in the\n\nKrajina in the houses in and around Rastovic and around where the Canadian\n\nsoldiers are stationed, returning now to uh reclaim their homes\n They have paperwork that shows they were in fact their homes\n And so we have a lot of movement of civilian populations in the\n\narea\n We have a number of uh refugees that have come to uh the camp at\n\nRastovic uh for succour looking for uh uh water and food and that sort of\n\nthing    and   a bit of protection from the    United   Nations to make sure that, uh they're\n\nwell looked after\n always some\n\nconfusion in a battlefield area uh immediately afterwards and that's what\n\nwe're seeing right now\n So our soldiers are patrolling the area trying to make sure that\n\nthere are no uh live rounds lying around because there was a lot of artillery\n\nbarrages    and   that sort of thing\n\n<$A>  What's the situation you mentioned refugees are there many of\n\nthem at this point?   coming to your  soldiers  \n\n<$B>  there are not as many as we uh might have\n\nexpected initially but uh we had I think at last count was nineteen    that   stayed last night near our camp in\n\nRastovic\n But there's also as I mentioned a lot of Croatian people who are\n\ncoming back to reclaim their homes and move into the area\n So there's still quite a bit of movement\n There's a lot of uh military movement in the area\n And so uh it's just uh as I say with respect to the forty-three\n\nit's simply a question of scheduling and making a mutually convenient time\n\nthat they can use the roads\n There are very very few roads in the area so uh traffic clogs them\n\nvery quickly\n\n<$A>  we sort of\n\nturned a corner here now that the Croatians have recaptured some of the\n\nterritory?\n Um does this change the peacekeeping mission?\n\n<$B>  Oh absolutely\n\n\nclear demarcation line between the two of them\n It is now the sovereign state of Croatia\n They are firmly in control uh certainly down in our area\n Uh and so I would suspect that uh the United Nations authorities\n\nin consultation with Croatian authorities will be coming up with some form of\n\n   either a   new mandate or a change to the current\n\nmandate or in fact even an end to the current mandate\n\n\n will   be uh on the uh Security Council's table this morning\n Uh and I think very soon we will probably receive uh new direction\n\nas to exactly what to do\n In the meantime there is a tremendous humanitarian mission that is\n\navailable here\n Uh there are lots and lots of refugees moving about in the area\n Uh there are Croatians migrating back in to take over their town\n So there's a constant movement of civilians\n And with that uh and of course war brings a lack of food a lack of\n\nwater, uh that type of thing   so I think that \n\n\nbiggest issue right now\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Thank you very much for speaking with us, this morning\n\n<$B>  Okay my pleasure\n\n<$A>  of the Canadian\n\nArmed Forces \n\n\n\n<$A>  The summer barbeque can be followed

it's not uncommon in\n\nstore-bought meat\n Trouble is that ten percent of children who get hamburger disease\n\n<,> can go on to develop serious kidney disease\n is the national coordinator of a

planning to publish results from an\n\nextensive, three year study, it conducted involving hundreds of\n\nCanadian children and uh they were diagnosed with so-called Hamburger Disease\n how did these, kids, get the disease?\n\n<$B> \n\nseveral ways that you can come into contact with Hamburger Disease although\n\nour nickname uhm being    that would   make one\n\nthink it comes from eating undercooked hamburger \n That is quite true although, in addition person to person\n\nspread is really the number one ah risk factor involved with this infection\n\n<$A>  So it's food-borne?\n\n<$B>  Yep that's exactly right\n\n<$A>  if\n\n  it's undercooked    that's   a tip-off\n\nright?\n\n<$B> \n\nabout    your   kitchens  \n\n for   a minute and preparing hamburgers for the barbeque at this\n\ntime of year, we can't see this bacteria in the ground beef,\n And of course most of us uhm myself included use our hands to\n\nprepare these hamburger patties\n Uh if the bacteria is there and if you are not, really really\n\nuh conscious of washing your hands well with warm soapy water, after you\n\nhave, handled the ground beef before you come into contact with your\n\nfamily members, or before you go on to prepare the salad as the next part\n\nof your meal, you really are risking spreading that bacteria within your\n\nkitchen\n\n<$A>  that\n\n  that   you can get it also through personal contact  \n\nRight  ?\n\n<$B> \n It's a very important finding and it's one really that uhm you\n\nknow when we first started working in this area, uhm that really we were\n\nnot as acutely

{'text': '<$A>  Mister Speaker that is, very strong endorsement, from\n\nthe province of, Nova Scotia\n Lastly, I would like to refer to the representation made by the\n\nrepresentatives from, New Brunswick and Alberta governments who kindly\n\nanswered uh the invitation that was made to all provinces to appear in front\n\nof the standing committee on H R D \n This is what Mister Smith, from New Brunswick responded to a\n\nquestion from the M O from    Mercier   as\n\nto whether the bill was an intrusion into provincial jurisdiction,\n\n He added that the, federal-provincial agreements, provided for\n\nin the bill as well as the enhanced administrative and technical,\n\nco-operation the bill would lead to a further guarantee, of continued\n\nfederal provincial full co-operation with respect to designation, of\n\nauthority\n This is what Mister Hemmingway from, Alberta commented\n I think, one of the problems, we have today in relation to the\n\nfederal loan program is discrepancies between and amongst provinces with\n\nrespect to which institutions, may be designated,\n I know that the federal concern has been given that it\'s a national\n\nprogram\n The benefits should be reasonably equal across the country\n We are presuming and it is our understanding that we will have a\n\ngreat deal of input in developing the designation criteria that will be put\n\nin place and that those criteria would be negotiated on ongoing basis between\n\nthe two levels of government,\n this\n\nlegislation clearly indicates, is that if there is, one single group of\n\npeople that are against this legislation are the members of the Bloc\n\nQuébécois,\n to\n\n , to   the specific issue, the specific uh motion,\n\nand to tell you that we   , as a   government\n\nare, committed to providing consistency and fairness under our student\n\nassistance program,\n The amendment presented uh would repeal subsection, four two and\n\nfour three of the bill, which provide the minister with the flexibility to\n\nestablish policy directives\n And Mister Speaker I think that if we are to look at this, in a\n\nvery clear and rational way, there is nothing wrong with the federal\n\nminister having something to say about a federal initiative a federal policy\n There\'s absolutely nothing wrong\n It is within his right and may I say it is his duty and obligation\n\nto make sure that he has something to say about the policy initiatives the\n\npolicy direction under    this   particular act\n\n<,,>\n And so I fail to understand and I have spent a great deal of time\n\ntrying to, figure it out exactly what the opposition is saying, and\n\ntrying to follow a logic of the opposition but perhaps, the problem is not\n\none of logic\n Perhaps, the problem here goes above and beyond that\n It\'s a question of vision,\n But for the moment Mister Speaker I\'m not here and I\'m not going to\n\nengage myself in a constitutional discussion\n The reason why I am debating today, is because there are\n\nhundreds of thousands of students, who are awaiting, this program\n\nprovinces awaiting this program, part-time students students with\n\ndisabilities women who want to pursue doctoral studies, students who have\n\n<,> been victimized by heavy debt load\n This is the issue, that we are debating today,\n It is for this reason that I simply cannot, support the\n\namendment as proposed, by the Bloc Québécois,\n government must\n\nbe in a position to ensure that, the policies which are developed are\n\napplied consistently across the country\n It would uh appear that the opposition, is not overly concerned\n\n<,> about treating students fairly throughout Canada because of, their own\n\npolitical agenda\n Therefore Mister Speaker I tell you on behalf of the thousands of\n\nstudents who are awaiting this program on the thousands of students in need\n\n<,> who want to acquire the skills to be competitive, to acquire the life\n\nskills necessary to meet the challenges, of the new economy, acquire\n\nthe education that is part and parcel of life today as we live through, a\n\nlearning continuum, as we engage in    life-long\n\n  learning it is fundamental, that we support these students\n And it is for that reason that I will not be supporting the motion\n\npresented by the Bloc Québécois \n\n<$B>  The honourable member for Medicine Hat,\n\n<$C>  Thank you very much Mister Speaker\n I rise to oppose this motion from the Bloc Québécois\n\n<,>\n Seems to me that the provinces have spoken with one voice on this\n\nissue,\n They had a chance to, speak up on Bill C twenty-eight\n They came before the Standing Committee on Human Resources\n\nDevelopment to talk about, this particular piece of legislation and in\n\nevery case they have suggested that they will go along with this legislation\n\nand that they are in support of it\n, to\n\nprovinces including Quebec, simply because,    uh the, members   down the\n\nway demand it\n We must be respectful of what, the provinces themselves are\n\nsaying\n Even in the case of Quebec\n They have indicated that they\'re quite comfortable with this\n\nparticular piece of legislation\n People in Alberta are happy with it\n People in the Maritimes are happy with it\n I don\'t really understand the paranoia down the way\n\n\n other, reasons uh for this motion coming up than the one stated\n Having said that Mister Speaker we cannot support this motion and\n\nwe will be saying more however down the road about some of the problems\n\ninherent in Bill C twenty-eight\n\n<$B> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$E> \n\n<$B> \n\n\nopposed     please say " nay " \n\n<$B> \n to Standing Order\n\nseventy-six point one, the recorded division in the motion stands\n\ndeferred.\n\n\n<$E> \n\n<$B>  The honourable member for Beaches-Woodbine\n\n<$F>  Thank you Mister Speaker\n thirty\n\n   percent     thirty years \n\n is a long time\n And we\'ve had this program for thirty years\n Federal-provincial\n\nco-operation   has existed under the Student Loan Act for thirty\n\nyears and the co-operation and support continues    to \n\n happen\n We heard from the parliamentary secretary just recently earlier\n\ntoday that in fact the provinces in this country do support this act\n And this is very important\n Mister Speaker under this bill provinces will continue to be able\n\nto opt out of the federal student assistance program if they choose to offer\n\ntheir own program to student assistance\n There\'s nothing new here\n Opted out provinces will be able to receive compensation if they\n\nhave a program which    has\n\nsubstantially the same   effect as the federal program\n This is nothing new again\n The government is simply carrying forward provisions from the\n\nprevious act\n Moreover Mister Speaker we are expanding uh provisions for\n\ncompensation to provinces which choose to opt out to ensure that their\n\nstudents benefit from the proposed reforms,\n This I think is a positive initiative\n We are also providing for accountability\n This is something that I believe is very critical if we are to be\n\naccountable to the taxpayers of this country Mister Speaker\n Accountability is something that the taxpayers have asked us to\n\nmake sure that we do\n For this reason we are asking those opted out jurisdictions to\n\nsatisfy the minister that they have in place a program that has substantially\n\nthe same effect as the federal program in order to receive compensation\n Surely Mister Speaker this is only responsible and reasonable,\n This can be accomplished by a simple letter once a year from\n\nnon-participant provinces\n It is not an onerous detailed demand\n It is a simple letter of response and communication\n It is not terribly demanding\n Section fourteen seven Mister Speaker establishes that a province\n\nchoosing to opt out is compensated for those program elements which are in\n\nplace at the provincial level\n Without section fourteen seven an opted out province could be\n\ncompensated for program, elements which are not available within that\n\nprovince\n To me Mister Speaker that would not be responsible\n We must be accountable and continue to be accountable to the\n\ntaxpayers\n We would increase the government cost without any assurance that\n\nstudents are receiving the benefits provided for under this legislation\n Again Mister Speaker I believe that it is important in this country\n\nand we have discussed it for the last eight months accountability in how we\n\nspend the federal tax dollar is very important\n in this in\n\nthis   uhm in this act  \n And they\'ve agreed to the provisions because they feel comfortable\n\nthat in fact their jurisdiction is not being affected that they are    protected   under    uh\n\nthe uh   Constitution and that this is a   \n\nco-operative  , process, working together for the benefit of\n\nthe students of this country    and in  \n\ndoing so ensuring that students across Canada will receive the same programs\n\nand have the same access to good programs, for post-secondary education\n So Mister Speaker I really see nothing new and nothing terribly uh\n\nearth shaking    in   these changes and I\n\nbelieve that they are for the benefit of Canadians\n Therefore I would say Mister Speaker that I suggest that this\n\nmotion is out of order\n If the motion stands I would urge all members to vote against it\n Thank you Mister Speaker\n\n<$B>  The honourable member for Medicine Hat\n\n<$C>  Thank you very much uh Mister Speaker,\n refued\n\n  referred   to the duty of the opposition,    when   the opposition looks at legislation such as we have\n\nbefore us today\n I think it\'s incumbent upon the opposition to give the legislation\n\na thorough vetting and when one comes across a clause that they\'re\n\nuncomfortable with to check it out to consult the stakeholders to find out\n\nwhat the different opinions are on it\n And after having done that if they are satisfied, that the\n\nstakeholders don\'t have any particular problem with it then they shouldn\'t\n\noppose it for the sake of opposing it\n And I point out, the members in the Bloc that although the\n\nGovernment of Quebec was invited to come before the H R D committee to talk\n\nabout this they did not\n They are comfortable apparently with this particular clause of the\n\nbill\n They have the ability of course and have taken advantage of the\n\nability to opt out,    of the  \n\nprevious act and presumably of this one as well\n I think it\'s very important that the opposition picks its time and\n\nplace to make a big deal about these things,\n But to cry wolf too often Mister Speaker, only guarantees that\n\nyou will have no audience when it\'s really important,\n I was very suspicious throughout the entire uh meetings that we had\n\nwith respect to this bill, about uh some of the intentions of the\n\ngovernment\n rights weren\'t\n\nbeing tampered with that they weren\'t being   \n\ninfringed   upon\n But in looking at it and after talking to all the people involved\n\ntalking to the ministers their departments rather and their officials,\n\nthey don\'t have concerns\n I don\'t understand why we\'re even talking about this given the\n\nfact that even the Government of Quebec, doesn\'t seem to have any concerns\n\n\ninterest of expediency I would hope that we will uh defeat this motion\n\n<$B> \n\n<$G> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$H> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$I> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$J> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$K> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$L> \n\n<$B> \n\n\n\n<$C> \n\napplause ,\n\n<$A>  Uh thank you very much Mister Speaker\n Uh scandals and unfounded allegations and unanswered questions\n\nhave plagued government and Parliaments throughout our history and certainly\n\nthe Prime Minister\'s statement this morning was welcome    in light   of our past\n\nhistory\n In his speech this morning on integrity in government the Prime\n\nMinister claimed that the power of the ethics counsellor will prevent

appointed him to help us\n But in the final analysis as I said this morning you know the\n\ngovernment remains the government\n We\'ve been elected to make ah decisions and we\'re trying to get the\n\nbest advice possible\n And Mister Wilson is a man of some credibility that has done his\n\njob properly advising ministers over a long period of time\n He is competent and we\'re very happy that he has accepted to face\n\nthese new responsibilities\n But his job is not to replace the government\n\n\n<$C>  The honourable member for Kindersley-Lloydminster\n\n<$A>  Thank you Mister Speaker\n And I appreciate the Prime Minister\'s answer because he\'s made it\n\nfairly clear I think in our minds that    uh the   new ethics counsellor\n\ndoes not have power    of   intervention but his\n\npower lies in his ability to report to the public\n So therefore uh this morning uh\n Pardon me\n Recently it was decided that a single annual report from the\n\nAuditor General was not sufficient\n And this morning the Prime Minister informed this House that the\n\nnew ethics counsellor would report just once a year to Parliament\n Mister Speaker based on past performance and our history conflicts\n\nof interest and ethics may arise on a regular basis and certainly an annual\n\nreport to Parliament will not be sufficient\n So my question Mister Speaker is can the Prime Minister explain how\n\nthe ethics counsellor can effectively communicate to the public uh without a\n\nchance of political interference regarding the conduct of government if he is\n\nonly required to file a report annually \n\n<$C>  The honourable Minister of Industry\n\n<$D>  Mister Speaker uhm I think the question that is being raised\n\nin terms of the ethics counsellor misses the point\n What the honourable member should be noting is that at the present\n\ntime there is no ethics counsellor and no reports have been filed\n\n\ncommit    commitment  \n I\'m sorry\n\n this government has done today\n\nis moved forward on a number of important commitments that were contained in\n\nthe Red Book  commitments   \n\nto   uh fulfil the report of the uh standing committee of the House\n\nof Commons from last June the commitment to appoint an ethics counsellor the\n\ncommitment to give him investigatory powers the commitment to stop the\n\ncontingency fees that were  polluting the\n\ngovernment procurement process\n These are important commitments\n We have met them\n\n\n\n\n<$C>  The honourable member for Yorkton-Melville\n\n<$A>  Thank you Mister Speaker\n My question is for the Minister of Justice\n On March fourteenth the minister said in the House and I\'d like to\n\nquote  I do not believe it is reasonable for anybody to interpret the\n\nterm " sexual orientation " as it appears in the human\n\nrights legislation as including pedophiles \n Mister Speaker whether child molesters are homosexual or\n\nheterosexual in their orientation they certainly are not reasonable\n And Mister Speaker child abusers will find it entirely reasonable\n\nto launch a challenge to the Criminal Code on the basis of their sexual\n\norientation if the term is not    defined  \n\nin the Human Rights Act\n My question\n Why is the minister so reluctant to define the term sexual\n\norientation \n\n<$C>  The honourable parliamentary secretary\n\n<$B>  want to say to\n\nthe honourable member that the Minister of Justice is in no way reluctant to\n\ndefine the term " sexual orientation " but he himself has\n\nexpressed the seriousness of this question in the relevant situations\n It is going to require a good deal of study to deal with this and\n\nthe    Minister   of Justice is now in the\n\nmiddle    of   doing this study in the department\n definition\n\nof " sexual orientation " but we will be able to bring\n\nforward to the House    a   program    uh and a   policy which I think the House will\n\napprove \n\n<$C>  The honourable member for Yorkton-Melville\n\n<$A>  Thank you\n I appreciate that,\n And if the meaning of that term " sexual orientation\n\n" is so clear and he referred to jurisprudence    previously   as being the avenue by which he would have it\n\nbe defined then I believe that government should take over should not shirk\n\nits responsibilities and it should define this because the minister said\n\n I do not think matters of public policy should be determined in the\n\ncourts \n So I would like to put this question to the Minister\n Why is he not willing to take that responsibility let that be\n\ndiscussed here and to define it properly in the legislation \n\n<,>\n\n<$C>  The honourable parliamentary secretary,\n\n<$B>  Minister of\n\nJustice I think    has   put before this House a\n\nrecord which    is   enviable       in   my opinion   \n has brought forward\n\nlegislation    on   young offenders on sentencing uh\n\nah amendments to the Criminal Code and the fact of the matter is    if   justice is going to be done laws must be framed\n\nproperly\n And uh not all of the amendments that we would like to see can be\n\ndone at the same time\n And the fact of the matter is reflection and due care must be given\n\nto the presentation and the formulation of these laws\n\n\n\n\n<$C> ,\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$C>  The honourable Minister of Health\n\n<$B>  Mister Speaker I must say that AIDS is a very serious uh\n\nepidemic and uh if we can save one, life then we must do everything in our\n\npower\n This particular booklet, was put together especially for those\n\ncommunities at risk and there are times Mister Speaker when you have to call\n\na spade a spade or people won\'t understand \n\n<$C>  The honourable member for Wild Rose\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$C>  Order\n Order,\n Order,\n sure the honourable member will\n\nwant to put his supplementary\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  The honourable Minister of Health\n\n<$B>  Mister Speaker this information was certainly not put together\n\nfor young children but these kinds of behaviours are extremely risky and\n\nthose who do participate in these kinds of behaviours should have the kind of\n\nknowledge that they need to make sure they do not spread the H I V AIDS virus\n\n \n\n\n\n<$C>  The honourable member for Saint-Denis\n\n<$A> \n Can the parliamentary secretary tell us what concrete steps have\n\nthe federal and provincial governments agreed to in their efforts to house\n\nCanadians in need \n\n<$C>  Your honourable parliamentary secretary\n\n<$B> \n Agreement to remove and reduce duplication and overlap to harmonize\n\nthe building codes in Canada\n They\'ve completed consultations on environmental problems but most\n\nimportantly Mister Speaker it was agreed to develop new partnerships to\n\ndevelop additional strategies to attack social housing to,\n\n To establish priority of need in each of the jurisdictions by the\n\nend of summer and to come forward with new concrete initiatives that they\n\nwill develop from the savings and efficiencies that they have undertaken\n It\'s a boon Mister Speaker for Canadians who earn low income in\n\nremote small isolated rural and urban areas as well as for home owners and\n\nrenters \n\n<$C>  The honourable member for Fraser Valley West\n\n<$D>  Thank you Mister Speaker\n Mister Speaker my question is for the Minister of Citizenship and\n\nImmigration\n September nineteen ninety-three Mister Speaker a young lady in my\n\nriding was raped, by an illegal immigrant\n I have in my possession a lengthy criminal record of that\n\nindividual which reflects sex offences drunk driving theft and on and on it\n\ngoes\n My question for the minister is this\n What system is in place to ensure that people like this are kicked\n\nout of Canada and stay out of Canada \n\n<$C>  The honourable Minister of Immigration\n\n<$E>  Mister Speaker this government uh, doesn\'t accept illegal\n\nimmigrants    as   much as uh this member or this\n\nparty\n And in fact tomorrow, we will be tabling legislation in the\n\nHouse of Commons to further strengthen, the fact that those individuals\n\nwho come here illegally those individuals who commit crimes against the very\n\nsystem    of   justice and values that we believe\n\nin as Canadians that those ammendments tomorrow will be in effort to further\n\nstrengthen those who wish to abuse our laws will pay the price \n\n<$C> \n\n<$D>  Speaker uh the minister\'s going to\n\nhave a good opportunity today to uh just see how well he backs that up\n\nbecause this young lady, agreed to drop the sexual assault charges on the\n\ncondition, on the condition this repeat offender was deported\n And he was in November last year\n Now I find this chronic sex offender this failed refugee claimant\n\nis back in my community, to appear by invitation by this minister\'s\n\nofficials to appear at a second hearing to be allowed to stay in Canada \n Mister Speaker, my question is this to the minister\n Why is he even getting a hearing in the first place and why has\n\nthe government reneged reneged on its promise to keep this criminal out of\n\nCanada \n\n<$C>  The honourable Minister of Immigration\n\n<$E>  audience\n\ngrumbling ,\n,\n intend\n\nto engage on the floor of the, House of Commons    on a\n\n  case where A the member has not given me advanced notice of the\n\nmember\'s uh name uh or the case file\n\n\n<,,>\n No no\n Mister Speaker,\n\n<$A> , the member\n\n  may not wish to respect the legislation privacy legislation due\n\nprocess\n say again to the\n\nhonourable member is that no one on that side has a virtue or a monopoly on\n\nvirtue about those cases that are abhorrent to all Canadians\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  And I will certainly look at the case that the honourable\n\nmember speaks about and that we tomorrow will be putting forward amendments\n\nwith the aim Mister Speaker of making it very very clear that those in the\n\nminority who abuse will have those loopholes closed\n And I hope that his party will look forward to a passage speedy\n\nfor that piece of legislation  \n\n\n\n<$C> \n\n<,,>\n\n<$A>  Thank you Mister Speaker\n My question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration\n\nfurther

Recently the minister gave an address uh outlining the government\'s\n\nplans to systematically dismantle the transportation system in this country\n\nand it should have been entitled Goodbye to the National Dream\n Mister Speaker the minister calls his plan "\n\ncommercialization " but it is clear that he means "\n\nprivatization " and will affect seventy-five per cent of the\n\ndepartment\'s activities\n And I want to ask the minister to be clear, with Canadians\n His policy clearly follows the Tory Royal Commission on transport\n And I\'d like to ask the minister to explain how his plan to\n\ncommercialize is different from the Tory\'s plan to privatize which he opposed\n\nso vehemently in the last Parliament\n\n<$C>  The honourable Minister of Transport\n\n<$E>  want to\n\nassure uh my honourable colleague that there is no intention to dismantle the\n\ntransportation system\n What in fact we\'re trying to do Mister Speaker is to ensure that\n\nthere is an integrated affordable transportation system available to\n\nCanadians to    move   both people and products\n But I want to say to my honourable colleague that uh many uh people\n\nwho follow the transportation scene will recognize uh in the\n\ncommercialization approach that we are trying to maintain the Government of\n\nCanada\'s involvement in a supervisory a regulatory    a \n\n policy uh way uh uh    the   work that we\'re\n\ndoing in transportation but we also understand that we have to have business\n\nand commercial practices applied to the way we do administer the\n\ntransportation system\n\n\n  have   seen former uh ministers of transport uh uh    of a   Liberal stripe attempt to do these kinds of\n\nthings\n It is not a Tory agenda\n It\'s an agenda designed to provide Canada with a transportation\n\nsystem that will support the economy that\'s required to pay for the social\n\nprograms that are at the heart of Liberal policy ,\n\n<$C> \n\n point of order from uh the honourable

Scarborough-Agincourt,\n\n<$B>  Madam Speaker I\'ve been working on amendments to the Young\n\nOffenders Act since the day I was elected\n I want to share with my colleage across because some of the things\n\nthat I have heard just certainly I could not comprehend\n particular act that\n\nwe\'re dealing with right now was first tested in nineteen eighty-five when a\n\nyoung individual in my riding, killed uh three people a mother a father\n\nand a seven-year old uh, daughter\n This young offender received in total three years\n My constituents were just just just, could\n There were no words to describe their feelings\n What I\'m hearing from the honourable member is that the Liberal\n\nParty wanting to appease    the Reform\n\n \n this\n\n  this   changes about because of the Reform Party\n\n\nbeacon of changes    to the   Young Offenders\n\nAct\n And certainly I disagree with my colleague is saying\n\n\n  we should have   something which is called\n\n" adolescent "\n Well this young individual that snuffed, snuffed Madam Speaker\n\nthree lives, he was not an adolescent\n He had moved already, into that particular world which is called\n\nan adult\n He committed a crime,\n you do the crime you pay the\n\ntime ,\n the Speaker the the\n\nmy   uh my honourable colleague   saying that, we don\'t\n\nneed prisons we need rehabilitation and    I\n\nquite agree   we need rehabilitation\n But the one question that I have for the honurable member is the\n\nfollowing\n What in her view, should, a young offender get, when that\n\nindividual, commits a severe crime such as, a killing, or a rape\n young\n\nadolescent don\'t worry about it we\'re    going to \n\n give you a pat on the back and you\'re not old enough to do it, or are\n\nwe    going to   say to that adolescent you did\n\nthe crime you    got to   pay the time\n at home Madam Speaker if a\n\nyoung offender were to kill a member of her family what would the honourable\n\nmember precisely want to see, the justice to be served and what kind of\n\ntime should that young offender be paying\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$C> \n I\'m sorry\n The honourable member for New Westminster-Burnaby,\n\n<$D>  Thank

my colleague from Quebec say about what\n\nshould be the balance between uh victim\'s needs and offender\'s needs uh as\n\noutlined uh in the preamble as to the general direction as to where the act\n\nuh should be administered\n I notice that uhm the word " victim " I don\'t\n\nbelieve is not mentioned at all in the preamble and I would like her views on\n\nthe balance between uhh victim\'s needs and offender\'s needs especially as it\n\nshould be outlined in the preamble of the Young Offenders Act\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$E> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  the honourable\n\nSecretary

commit serious crimes\n Madam Speaker I\'d like to uh sort of preambulate my speech by\n\nsaying that we all have responsibilities in this country of Canada that we\n\nshouldn\'t predicate, the effectiveness of programs uhm on what our    political   agendas are\n I think we have a responsibility for the young people of this\n\ncountry and, this piece of legislation and the amendments are to clearly\n\nto address the needs that are there\n Uhm I must say that I\'m happy to be a member of Parliament and a\n\ncontributing member so to speak, that will perhaps add to a healthy debate\n\n<,> and makes viable suggestions, that would, fortify the country bring\n\npeople together and to carve out a future for young people in this country\n\nrather than to talk about some rather destructive means uh that uhm would,\n\nnot bring any enjoyment or any good health to the country such as it is\n I\'m pleased uh uh on June the second the Minister of Justice\n\ntabled amendments to the Young Offenders Act\n These amendments recognize the public\'s growing concern about,\n\nyouth violence and demonstrate the priority this government places on\n\nprotecting the public\n These amendments uh

{'text': "<$A>  We're a country that basically wants Canadians to know that we\n\nall have a responsibility for our country and consequently for our actions\n However as the Minister of Justice uh made clear legislation is only\n\none part of the answer to violence among young people\n Protecting the public is the primary and necessary objective but we\n\nmust focus our attention on helping our young people if we are to find\n\nlasting and effective solutions to youth crime\n I'm encouraged to see that the amendments to the Young Offenders Act\n\ninclude provisions for the rehabilitation and treatment of young offenders in\n\nthe community\n\n\nyouth   crime questions that the Standing Committee on    Justice   and Legal Affairs will be examining as\n\npart of the reform of the youth justice system\n the opportunity to work\n\nwith my colleagues in the House to take action, on the contributing\n\nfactors    to   crime and violence such as\n\nunemployment poverty alcoholism drug and substance abuse family violence\n\nracism and illiteracy\n are\n\njustify   uh justify   any kind of violent crimes or should\n\ncontribute to, uh saying that young people have the right to commit crimes\n That really isn't\n These are mitigating factors\n These are things that, make it very difficult for young people\n\nto have a life that's well a life that's healthy and a life that keeps them\n\nfrom that side of uhm uhm the negative side of life so to speak\n Socioeconomic misery and crime are two sides of the same coin\n By addressing these problems in our society we will be tackling,\n\nthe root causes of youth crime and ultimately adult crime\n It does not take any stretch of the imagination to see how such\n\nsocioeconomic misery fuels anger frustration anti-social behaviour and\n\ncriminal activity    among young people  \n\n\nof many of our    that many of our aboriginal youth\n\n  face as they walk through the perilous path to adulthood\n Unemployment among aboriginal people is twice the Canadian level\n It is the number one problem facing aboriginal communities and they\n\nhave the lowest incomes of anyone in the country\n Illiteracy rate among aboriginal people is twice the national\n\naverage\n High school dropout rates can be as high as ninety-five per cent in\n\nisolated northern communities\n\n\nunder the age years   under the age    of\n\ntwenty-four    ,\n The aboriginal population is very young growing fast and on the\n\nmove\n The majority of aboriginal peoples do not live on reserves and the\n\nmigration of on-reserve aboriginal peoples to urban centres particularly in\n\nwestern Canada is increasing\n In Manitoba it is estimated that one out of four new entrants into\n\nthe job market will be of aboriginal origin\n In Saskatchewan it will be one out of three\n Are they destined for a life of unemployment social problems crime\n The odds seem stacked against them but this not need be the case\n Five to six times the number of aboriginal peoples are incarcerated\n\nin provincial and federal institutions as compared to aboriginal peoples in\n\nthe general population\n Yet aboriginal peoples only represent approximately three point\n\nseven per cent of the Canadian population\n The state of many aboriginal peoples in Canada is not a pretty\n\npicture\n Despite these socioeconomic problems progress has been made in\n\nhealth education economic community development and social services\n Such progress is often linked to aboriginal peoples having\n\nculturally appropriate services controlled by aboriginal peoples\n I'm proud to be a part of a government that recognizes the enormous\n\npotential that our young people    have to offer \n\n and that is prepared to invest in their abilities and to give them hope\n\nand opportunities for the future\n This government has implemented a number of programs and services\n\nwe feel that will help aboriginal youth and other youth as well recognize\n\ntheir strengths and grow to their full potential and to see the sun on the\n\nhorizon in an optimistic uhm manner\n I as Secretary of State for Training and Youth along with the\n\nMinister of Human Resources Development we have announced a youth strategy\n This strategy will attack some of the root causes for turning,\n\nyouth into young offenders\n In my riding uhm Madam Speaker last month uhm we made ah a\n\ncontribution to ah a youth program with the Gwich'in people\n The Gwich'in people have taken it upon themselves to build their\n\nown healing centre to deal with many of their social and justice issues many\n\nof their health issues\n\n\nthey're   that they're   building with people who have the\n\nexpertise from in and outside of their own communities\n Last month we announced thirty-seven projects as part of the first\n\nwave of Youth Service Canada\n We feel it's necessary to send a signal out there that young people\n\ncan be contributing to their community and not taking away from their\n\ncommunity with what    uh many   attribute to\n\nyoung people as being very negative as only young offenders tend to get all\n\nof the stories and all of the ink and all of the news media covering them\n There are many young people out there who are doing wonderful\n\nthings who are not being celebrated and who are not being recognized\n\n\nyears   year olds   gain work experience develop their skills\n\nlearn good work habits improve their self-esteem through community service\n\nprojects\n I wish you to know Madam Speaker that Youth Service Canada should\n\nprovide opportunities for youth to break away from the socioeconomic factors\n\nwhich have held them back and have seduced    some who have uh basically become involved in a life\n\nof crime  \n Just recently Madam Speaker it should be noted that I attended the\n\nUniversity of Calgary's graduation uh for their native students\n\n\nd    university degrees   some of them with a Bachelor of\n\nSocial Work some of them with a Bachelor of Education\n There was a young girl there who or a young woman who uhm uh\n\ngraduated with an engineering degree\n Those young people are very healthy models outstanding citizens who\n\nwill help their communities and this country as well\n So far Madam Speaker it's not all bad news\n uhm that\n\n  graduated from the University of Calgary they did so under the\n\nleadership of uh one Mister  Rob Carion  who works with native\n\nstudents across this country who works on the uh Calgary Police Commission\n\nand contributes in a number of ways\n But it takes leadership and it takes caring\n\n\n to these    young people   to\n\nencourage them to let them know that the government cares that people in\n\ntheir community care that we in this House my   \n\nhonourable colleagues   and along with myself care about them and are\n\ndirecting our efforts to deal with those things\n Thus far Madam Speaker across Canada from all the colleges and\n\nuniversities we have graduated ninety-two thousand aboriginal graduates from\n\nuniversities and colleges\n That's quite a huge cadre of professionals who would contribute in\n\nsome way to their community\n\n\n  Edmonton      Journal  \n\nMadam Speaker and in there they featured also the graduation of native law\n\nstudents\n of\n\nthem on the front of this\n And I knew most of them uh but the one that sort of leaped out at\n\nme was uh none other than Mister  Josh Tanguay  from the Northwest\n\nTerritories an already twenty year veteran a native student a twenty year\n\nveteran of the R C M P  who's\n\ncontributed to his community and to his country\n He's a proud Canadian who's worked hard for law and order in this\n\ncountry\n He's a proud Canadian who has worked for his young people in his\n\ncommunity\n He's a model for these young people\n That is how it's done\n Success is the way in the native communities to bring further\n\nsuccesses\n So these ninety-two thousand people that have graduated thus far\n\n<,> along with these law students who were uhm uh on the uh front of the\n\nEdmonton Journal is the way to go\n of\n\n  uh of   young offenders and the whole issue of social\n\njustice    and   a number of other justice issues\n\nas well\n There is rehabilitated but there's also the way of leadership young\n\npeople who set an example as these people will do\n Madam Speaker uhm a part of the consultations uh on the concept of\n\nYouth    Service   Canada had me   , in   contact with many youth across this country\n\nhundreds of groups that I met with\n And I had the occasion to go to the, stadium\n Uh we talk about all the bad things that are happening Madam\n\nSpeaker\n to\n\nthe     stadium    in   Toronto the\n\nSkyDome\n There were fifty thousand young people at the SkyDome\n These young people were there with their school boards and these\n\nfifty thousand young people were celebrating in a positive way what they call\n\nthe Journey of Hope\n And they were accompanied by their teachers\n\n\ncelebration to show that young people in this country are not just involved\n\nin crimes that they are doing many wonderful things\n I had the occasion to be at many many uh graduations across the\n\ncountry many of which involved aboriginal youth but many which involve\n\nordinary Canadian citizens across this country\n It's positive\n wonderful to see people doing\n\nsomething constructive which they get no credit for\n So I'd just like to celebrate that with you Madam Speaker and uh my\n\nhonourable colleagues here\n Youth\n\nService Canada project I believe that every department every Crown\n\ncorporation will do its part to forge those ah partnerships that will produce\n\nhealthier young people more well contributing young people across this\n\ncountry\n\n Dene\n\nTulu  is uh the path that you walk on\n The path that you walk on Madam Speaker is the path of your own\n\nchoosing\n We've integrated that as one stream into the youth service corps\n\nbecause we need young people who have been marginalized who have been left\n\nout who have dropped    out of schools  \n\nthey've dropped out of learning they've dropped out of the labour market and\n\nessentially they become so marginalized they drop out of life\n We need to rebuild confidence\n We have to get them back to work back to learning\n\n\nwhich uh or which is called  Tulu  which would have them\n\ncontributing\n\n Whether the path that you choose, is good or bad is really up to\n\nyou\n That's a Dene form of justice\n is one of our four guiding themes for Youth\n\nService Canada project\n could directly assist those young offenders\n\nwho are in community based rehabilitation programs\n Young offenders were also prominent at some of our consultations\n\nacross Canada along with the disabled and along with    the homeless   youth\n Youth Service Canada is one part of the government's actions to\n\nhelp young people to make the transition from school to the workforce or to\n\nreintegrate into society\n There are many attempts Madam Speaker that we could uh talk about\n\nthat the government has put forward\n We put forward a youth strategy\n We have a youth internship program\n On these uh very few days of the past we've been discussing the\n\nchanges to

of ninety-five per cent in some areas as I've\n\nindicated\n A lot of discussion that preceded these amendments to the Young\n\nOffenders Act focused on violent crime and a need to get tough with young\n\ncriminals but let's not lose sight of the fact that less than twenty per cent\n\nof the youth crimes are violent acts\n Of\n\ncourse they   get most of the attention because it's very unfortunate\n\nand uh    uh it's   very negative\n That's what usually gets a lot of the ink and a lot of the air time\n sight of the fact\n\n  that    less than twenty per cent \n\n are violent acts\n youth crimes are property and\n\nalcohol related\n Getting tough and throwing these young people behind bars is not\n\nthe best    answer   in these situations\n\nnecessarily\n We're not saying that leniency is the answer\n We're saying that perhaps there're other ways of forging\n\nrelationships and partnerships that will help to reconstruct and rebuild\n\ncommunities\n We as parents as well Madam Speaker have a responsibility\n When a child is born and when a young child leaves the house to go\n\nto kindergarten you have no idea what that child will turn out but if you as\n\na responsible member of the community don't do your level best don't do\n\neverything in your power to provide for that child the nurturing the love the\n\nguidance    there   really is almost a\n\nguarantee that you're sealing the fate of that person to a life of negativity\n\n   uh and   great downfall\n Even if you do everything right Madam Speaker there is no guarantee\n If you don't do anything to help young people you're almost sealing\n\ntheir fate to a life that's really not very positive\n So I encourage, communities Madam Speaker I encourage all the\n\npeople that affect young people\n It takes one person in your life to have a positive impact on you\n It could be a counsellor\n\n\nofficer\n It could be a teacher\n It could be a kindergarten teacher\n It could be a friend an aunt or an uncle\n Somebody to reach out to a young person and to encourage and to be\n\nthere Madam Speaker is what it takes sometimes\n So I'd like to encourage people at the community level\n Remember that the responsibility is not just in legislation or\n\namendments\n The responsibility is the relationship we forge together as members\n\nof this country a wonderful country members of our communities wonderful and\n\ndiverse communities that contribute to making life better for everyone\n We have a responsibility for the future of this country and the\n\nfuture of this country is basically going to be drawn out through the young\n\npeople that we nurture that we guide that we teach    that the government   and all of the\n\ngovernance that we leave behind us is in their hands is for them\n We have that responsibility Madam Speaker\n We have an onerous responsibility but if we do nothing I think that\n\nwe will in this sense reap nothing\n And I appeal to all of the people across the country to remember\n\nthat laws are guides\n They guide us\n work in the highest uh\n\ninstitution or court in this land and we are building laws  \n\n and   remaking laws and changing laws but we can't legislate\n\ncaring and loving and nurturing the things that the countries have to give to\n\nensure that the young offenders uh the situation with the young offenders is\n\n   uh

slap on the wrist and he's uh,\n He's even scared to leave his home because he's been robbed by\n\nthese two grandsons in the past\n And I want to know what kind of crackdown you're speaking about\n\nhere\n\n\nyou've   suggested that only twenty-five per cent of the acts    are   violent but uhm I would put these in\n\nthat violent class that    there's  \n\nrobberies involved\n us and

and rehabilitation\n\ncan both be achieved through youth court extending the time that sixteen and\n\nseventeen year old young offenders who have been convicted of murder in an\n\nadult court must serve before they can be considered for parole    improved   measures for information sharing\n\nbetween professionals like school officials and police with selected members\n\nof the public when public safety is at risk as well as retaining the record\n\nof serious young offenders provisions that will encourage rehabilitation and\n\ntreatment of young offenders in the community when this is appropriate\n\n\nnecessarily speak to the question that the member asked but I do believe over\n\n   in   the various communities that will be\n\naffected by this legislation and in the various provinces and territories\n\nthere are    the justice ministers uh on the\n\nprovincial and territorial levels who   are looking at attempts to\n\nbetter deal with young offenders in their own regions in their provinces\n And what some of those attempts would be like having I guess\n\ncommunity service work uh\n And one suggestion that's proved quite viable in the aboriginal\n\ncommunity that I might share with you is this\n young\n\noffenders have been sent out on the land to do, physical labour hard\n\nlabour in camps where they've had to cut wood and haul water and do a lot of\n\nvery physical work that    the recidivism\n\n  rate with those young, offenders is virtually nil\n That's not necessarily boot camp\n They learn something\n They learn how to survive\n\n\n\n They regain their self-esteem\n But those are the kind of ideas that are being entertained out\n\nthere and I don't find them totally offensive  \n\n Madam Speaker   if they're coupled with other

would be happy to meet with him Madam Speaker outside of this\n\nChambers to discuss this program\n I would be happy also to discuss all of the other programs we have\n\nbecause we have other

\n\n<$C>  Questions and comments\n The honourable member for Berthier-Montcalm,\n\n<$E> \n\n<$C>  French introduction\n\n<$D> \n\n<$C>  Resuming debate\n\n\nMaple   Creek-Assiniboia,\n\n<$F>  Thank you Madam Speaker,\n Two months ago ten years almost to the day after the passage of the\n\nYoung Offenders Act  Christopher Bartleby  was shot down in cold blood\n\non an Ottawa sidewalk,\n\n\n a young offender, we know    very\n\nlittle   about him,\n All we know is that he shot a man for a lark, for fun,\n There was a big public outcry, lots of calls for tougher law\n\nenforcement, and the media and the, usual brown shirted brigades of gun\n\ncontrol lobbyists were braying that we should stop crime, by getting tough\n\non honest citizens,\n This is something like a man who has two dogs one vicious and one\n\ngentle,\n The vicious dog bites the postman, and so to appease the postman\n\nthe man shoots the gentle dog, and then takes the vicious dog and tries to\n\nsweeten his temperament by overfeeding it,\n So what will happen to this young man,\n Uh because of the date of the crime I presume that he will be tried\n\nunder the old Young Offenders Act but for the sake of this discussion let's\n\nsay that he would be tried under the new one,\n Now it's less likely, under the new act than under the old that\n\nhe will be tried in an adult court, for the simple reason that the new law\n\nwill lead to interminable court delays with new process of reverse onus that\n\nhas been written into it,\n If he is convicted, he will face a maximum of ten years in\n\ncustody, no minimum of which perhaps six years could be in closed custody\n But judging on the way the laws have been enforced to date that's\n\nall rather hypothetical and somewhat unlikely\n So what should be done with a person like that,\n Now I respectfully suggest that murder by a sixteen year old is no\n\nless harmful to the victim than murder by an eighteen year old\n Therefore the penalties should be essentially the same,\n I am not suggesting immediate incarceration with older prisoners\n\n<,> where the young fellow would be the plaything of sexual predators\n That constitutes cruel and unsual punishment by any standards,\n\nand is unworthy of a civilized society\n But we should have institutions designed to serve specific age\n\ngroups\n We used to have these\n They were called reform schools,\n Now some honourable members may say oh but that's too expensive,\n\nwe can't afford it\n If we could rehabilitate some of these young hoodlums perhaps it\n\nwould be money well spent,\n And it shouldn't be expensive anyway\n It needn't be expensive, because young people incarcerated in a\n\nreform school could do useful work including growing their own food, which\n\n   adult prisoners   in the penitentiaries\n\nused to do also and which we've done away with, in most cases\n Why do we not go back to that,\n And when the young offender wasn't working to earn his keep, he\n\nshould be educated,\n Go easy on the pool tables and T V\n You know a fourteen year old young offender who is in open custody\n\nwas recently quoted, as saying  it's easy time \n,\n What, is that young fellow learning about the justice system,\n Now the proposed amendments to the Young Offenders Act are in our\n\nopinion purely cosmetic, a transparent attempt, to pacify a public\n\nwhich is clamouring for meaningful change,\n The government's response to almost everyone's principal demand\n\nthat the maximum age of application be lowered from seventeen years to\n\nfifteen years is to be sloughed off with a silly and meaningless compromise\n\n<,> requiring sixteen and seventeen year olds to establish through a tedious\n\nand expensive court process that they should not be tried in adult court for\n\nthe most serious crimes, murder attempted murder aggravated sexual assault\n\nand so on,\n The cost and confusion will be enormous, a bonanza for lawyers\n And since both reverse onus and judicial selectivity are involved\n\nsome lawyers will probably be able to seek the spotlight and beef up their\n\nincomes by mounting a charter challenge,\n This is an act written by lawyers for lawyers,\n\n\ncan't you pass a law down there forbidding lawyers to run for Parliament\n\n,\n Now in this House on June the sixth, the honourable member for\n\nSaint Hubert said,  these motions will be similar to extradition\n\nproceedings \n\n Now I rarely agree with anything the honourable member says but I\n\ncertainly agree with that\n She was spot on,\n Of course her proposed solution differs from mine\n She would continue to treat these louts like poor little misguided\n\nchildren, subject to the same rules as thirteen and fourteen year olds,\n People of sixteen and seventeen aren't children for heaven's sake\n They hold down jobs\n They drive cars,\n They have babies with or without benefit of matrimony,\n And if they're unhappy in the parental home, generous social\n\nwelfare will in most provinces provide  \n\n reasonably comfortable   independence,\n Bill C thirty-seven rather than ensuring that these older young\n\noffenders will end up in adult court, makes it less likely than ever\n\nbecause of the reasons I have cited,\n Now I don't want to sound like a nagging parent saying when I was\n\nyour age, but at the age of seventeen I was working in a bush camp,\n\nswinging an axe to raise money so I could enter university and if anyone had\n\ndared to suggest to me that I was a child I would have been outraged\n We do young people no favours by relieving them of responsibility\n\n<,,>\n At the other end of the scale I can actually remember uh one of the\n\nhonourable members opposite probably won't believe this but I can remember\n\nwhen I was ten to thirteen years old\n My companions and I fought regularly, but never dreamed of using\n\nthe knives which as farm boys we all carried,\n We didn't try to maim each other,\n And we had an archaic code of conduct which might seem terribly\n\nquaint to the lawyers and social workers who have been trying to redesign our\n\nsociety,\n You didn't kick somebody who was down\n You didn't pick on little kids, or gang up on anyone and you\n\nnever never never hit girls\n In other words we knew the difference between right and wrong,\n So did my kids as recently as twenty years ago\n And so I venture to say to the young savages who terrorize their\n\nweaker classmates, vandalize property and give the finger to their\n\npowerless teachers, to exempt ten and eleven year olds from the rules of\n\ncivilized conduct is socially destructive madness\n A child who gets away with it, at ten or eleven years of age and\n\nwhose parents aren't held legally accountable for his or her actions learns a\n\nlesson which all the prattling counsellors and dreamy eyed social workers in\n\nthe world can't erase,\n Now the minister tells us that section forty-three of the Criminal\n\nCode which protects parents who do care about their kids and use reasonable\n\nforce to discipline them is up for review,\n What strange world does the Liberal Party inhabit,\n,\n\nthe road from uncorrected naughtiness to mean destructiveness, to full \n\n  blown   delinquency is short, and it's straight\n The government owes it to the children of Canada, and to the\n\nfuture of our society, to re-enter the world of every day Canadians,\n C thirty-seven is a start, but only a start\n Let's get on with it\n Madam Speaker I neglected to inform you that I am splitting my time\n\n<,> with the honourable member from Red Deer\n I hope I can put that in now\n\n<$C>  I, agree to accept it but you have already gone over\n think we better get to questions\n\nand comments\n Questions and comments\n All

he must be aware, that reform schools or youth wings as he\n\ncalls them do not exist anywhere in Canada any more\n Uhm and I am advocating and I'm advocating strongly that doing\n\naway with them was a mistake, because there is now no real mechanism to\n\ndeal with these young people\n You have the open custody situation or you have, jails for\n\nadults\n You really don't have much in between\n You have youngsters in remand centres, interminably\n And uh they get into more trouble there\n They get educated\n That's why we should have reform schools where they get proper,\n\neducation\n And yes I am nostalgic,\n I do yearn for a period of our history when society was orderly\n\nwhen there was a discipline of children when the police and the courts had\n\npower and exercised it,\n Uh I don't uh have a yearning for a police state but I do have a\n\nyearning for a state where people are safe, where there is a social\n\ncontract which involves decency a mutual respect among people\n We have lost that and a lot of it is due to the same frame of mind\n\nthat framed the original Young Offenders Act and which did not have the\n\ncourage to come forward and do a full job with C thirty

though criminal acts are committed by\n\nchildren under age twelve,\n All we need to do is look at the newspaper today\n They tell a harrowing tale about an Aylmer boy who held his\n\nclassmates at gunpoint\n The boy had a three fifty-seven magnum and nine millimetre pistol\n He was ten years old and apparently threatening the lives of his\n\nclassmates\n Yet he has not been charged because he is too young\n In nineteen ninety-three Regina police were paralysed to act after\n\na nine year old and an eleven year old attacked two young boys\n The victims were forcibly confined beaten and sexually abused\n Police could do nothing\n Parliament has not given them any power to act\n And so the stories could go on and we've heard many many of them\n\nrepeated here in this House\n Young offenders like these should be included in our youth criminal\n\njustice, so that they can receive treatment, so they can learn that\n\ntheir crimes are not acceptable to society, so we can be assured they do\n\nnot reoffend and finally so that they can eventually become productive\n\nmembers of the community\n We have the chance to reform the violent actions of these young\n\nchildren but we are missing this window of opportunity\n Madam Speaker Bill, C thirty-seven also fails in another area\n It softens the law for violent offenders under age sixteen\n The amendments we are considering today will allow youth courts to\n\ndeal more harshly with murderers\n Indeed Canadians across the country have demanded that the current\n\nfive-year maximum sentence is a slap on the wrist\n The proposed changes will increase first degree murder sentences to\n\nten years\n In reality this translates to six years of custody and four years\n\nof community supervision\n Second degree murder, sentences will be increased to a\n\nseven-year maximum\n This translates into four years in custody and three years of\n\nsupervision\n I would argue that these changes will work to soften the law in its\n\ntreatment of murderers\n The slightly higher sentences will mean fewer violent offenders\n\nunder sixteen will be transferred to adult court\n The changes, before us today will ensure that many murderers\n\nwill remain under the Young Offenders Act\n The government argues that its amendments are sufficient\n It says most of the murder-related cases heard in youth court are\n\ncommitted by sixteen and seventeen year olds\n In nineteen ninety-two and ninety-three sixty per cent of the cases\n\nheard in youth court involved this age group\n These statistics like, the amendments before us today look good\n\nat first glance but once we look a little deeper we see the blemishes\n\n\n Madam   Speaker\n Offenders under age sixteen committed forty per cent of the murder\n\ncases heard in youth court at this time\n I would argue this is a significant proportion\n There is yet another flaw in these amendments Madam Speaker\n The general public is kept in the dark about violent repeat\n\noffenders\n The proposed changes will provide information on young offenders to\n\nthe police to school officials and child welfare workers\n Certain members of society whose safety is in jeopardy will also\n\nreceive information on the young offender,\n These seem like valid changes but in reality they are superficial\n The general public does not have access to this information\n Madam Speaker if certain members of the public can receive\n\ninformation about a young offender because    their\n\n  safety is at risk, why is the general public not also informed\n\n<,>\n a young\n\noffender will reoffend then all of society is at risk\n It is impossible for anyone to know for certain that only a\n\ntargeted few will be in danger\n If this government truly is interested in protecting all of society\n\nthen all of society should be informed about dangerous young offenders,\n This is not the case\n An additional flaw is that violent young offenders' records are not\n\nkept on file permanently\n The proposals also claim to protect society by allowing police to\n\nkeep the record of young offenders on file for ten years instead of five\n According to the justice department this change will ensure that\n\nthe length of time a young offender's record is kept is in keeping with the\n\nseriousness of the offence\n Madam Speaker keeping the young offender's murder record on file\n\nfor ten years does not begin to    mirror   the\n\nseriousness of the offence,\n Murder is permanent\n It demands a permanent record,\n It is fair Madam Speaker that the victims' names and ordeals be\n\nforever etched in the minds of their loved ones long after the murder record\n\nhas been wiped clean\n Madam Speaker society has the right to know\n If this government is truly interested in protecting society it\n\nshould keep all murder records and violent    crime \n\n records on file permanently,\n C thirty-seven also raises some questions about serving sentences\n\nin the community,\n Will the community sentences be adequate\n Under the changes set before us today more non-violent offenders\n\nwill serve their sentences in the community instead of in custody\n This change has many attributes\n Young offenders will not be influenced by harder violent offenders\n Often jail is considered a training ground for crime,\n It will save government money\n It costs approximately seventy-five thousand dollars to incarcerate\n\nan individual\n But the government in saving this money must be committed to\n\nredirecting some of it into the communities\n If these offenders are to live in our communities we must ensure\n\nthat they do not become repeat offenders\n We must protect society\n To do this some of these offenders may need treatment and we must\n\nensure that they receive it\n I am not talking about spending more money\n I'm talking about saving money and spending some of it more wisely\n In conclusion Madam Speaker I would like to say that when we make\n\nchanges    to   our criminal justice system we must\n\nensure that the system is predictable to society\n In order for a judicial system to act as an effective deterrent\n\ncitizens must be able to anticipate the outcome of their actions\n It is therefore important that the Young Offenders Act mirror the\n\nadult system as accurately as possible\n We still have a long way to go especially in the area of criminal\n\n<,> uh records and publication bans\n I believe these changes before us today are a small step toward\n\nthis goal\n Bill C thirty-seven is far from perfect but it will improve the\n\ncurrent system somewhat\n Amendments to Bill C thirty-seven are essential and I would urge my\n\nfellow members of Parliament to ensure that these are enacted\n\n\n<$C>  Questions and comments\n The honourable member for Saskatoon-Dundurn\n\n<$B>  Thank you Madam Speaker\n\n\n the   negative effect of increasing the sentencing uh and uh that\n\nthis will result in fewer individuals being transferred to adult court\n Perhaps I can remind the member Madam Speaker that uh the onus is\n\nreversed,\n A person such as that is automatically in adult court and must be\n\ntransferred down to, youth court or the young offenders court in the case\n\nof serious offences such as murder\n And as well Madam Speaker there is mention made of the Aylmer\n\nincident yesterday but no mention is ever made no mention whatsoever about\n\nthe father, and the parents\n And what about those guns\n How did they get into the hands\n Were they in the hands of law abiding individuals\n Were they in the hands of neighbours\n How did they get into the hands of the children\n Perhaps we should stop blaming the ten year old and start blaming\n\nthe adults that allow these guns to get into the hands of uh young people\n And there is a lot of rhetoric Madam Speaker about rehabilitation\n\nand productivity to society but no substance\n\n\nhonourable member   is what would you do\n How would you change it\n to deter\n\n  to deal   with rehabilitation and to make this young person\n\n<,> productive to society,\n\n<$C>  The honourable member for Red Deer\n\n<$A> \n\nthere's   a lot of things we could say that we would change\n certainly take a\n\nlook at things like boot camps and those sorts of things\n But I think more important to your question, uh we must include\n\n impact statements,\n We must include uh parents in the actual criminal justice system\n\nitself\n The parents have got to be forced to be there to hear what that\n\nvictim went through to hear what their little darling did to that person and\n\nthen they have to be part if they're found to be in any way responsible they\n\nhave to be part of that restitution, that money that's paid back    that  , fence that's fixed    uh\n\nwhatever that   damage has been\n They've got to be part of that\n So I agree with you fully\n We must involve the parents in this\n We must involve the victims in this\n And when we do that\n And I don't see that in Bill C thirty-seven\n\n\njust   satisfies the Red Book  claim\n\nthat we're going to make some changes but will do nothing to improve the\n\nactual situation we've got \n\n<$C>  Honourable member for Berthier-Montcalm\n\n<$D> \n\n<$C>  The honourable member for Red Deer\n\n<$A>  not quite sure\n\nexactly what the member is referring to but obviously what we're saying is we\n\ndon't abandon those children\n In fact we've got to do something about that rehabilitation\n We're already spending millions of dollars, uh on social\n\nprograms on various types of retraining programs and it's not working\n It's just not working\n And so we have to take a look then\n We have a bunch of academics who have this idealistic world,\n\nuhm where they can get solutions of where they think they have solutions but\n\nit's not working\n\n\nthat's   just the point\n The money we're putting in there now is being wasted,\n\n<$C>  Resuming debate\n The honourable\n I'm sorry\n We have one minute\n Uh time for a question from the honourable uh Parliamentary\n\nSecretary,\n He didn't want a

Young\n\nOffenders Act and    a much-needed   new bill\n\nto improve that act\n First of all let me congratulate the honourable Minister of\n\nJustice for this bill\n As I say Madam Speaker it offers to Canadians, as part of a\n\ntwo-step plan, some interim improvements to the youth justice system in\n\nthis country\n we\n\n  all as members recognize and acknowledge that as I say this will be\n\na two-step process\n This is not the final and finished product if you will\n If it were I would simply say to the honourable uh minister that\n\nit doesn't go far enough in the ultimate sense but for now it is a very good\n\nand major step in the right direction", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b158cacf-64cb-430c-b686-9581eb62f2da', 'added':

{'text': "<$A>  I think Madam Speaker it's important to note that, the\n\nsecond phase will be a thorough review by a parliamentary committee and by a\n\nfederal-provincial task force on the whole youth justice system and that\n\nthere will be considerable public input in that review process as there was\n\nand as there has been so far to this point\n Obviously it's very important to involve provincial legislatures,\n\nand provincial justice officials because the legal system obviously is\n\nadministered at both the federal and provincial levels,\n This bill offers some very badly needed improvements\n The original Young Offenders Act had an excellent rationale in my\n\nview\n It was simply to recognize the fact that, society in Canada as a\n\nnation we ought to deal with the young offender in a way different from, a\n\nmore mature offender, that the penalties ought to be different,    where   incarceration is required that there ought\n\nto be different facilities\n And I think that Canadians generally recognize that and accepted\n\nthat rationale,\n Unfortunately I think as we know on all sides of the House and as\n\nCanadians from coast to coast to coast know the Young Offenders Act has in at\n\nleast a minority of cases been somewhat badly abused\n There's not much question in my mind Madam Speaker when you see\n\nyoung offenders on national television in this country, telling Canadians\n\nthat they consider the uh Young Offenders Act as   \n\nsomething   of a joke and that they feel that  \n\n when   they're incarcerated that it's kind of like going to camp\n And you hear that on national T V from young offenders repeat young\n\noffenders    there's no doubt   in my mind that Canadians feel and\n\nrightly so that there are some problems with the current legislation\n the\n\nminister   the honourable minister   is seeking uh to put\n\nforth these improvements as step one of the ultimate act that we will have in\n\nplace in this country,\n that\n\n  that   are offered in the uh proposed legislation\n I think one of the major, improvements is the provision that\n\nwould, put the onus on a sixteen or seventeen year old offender,\n\nconvicted of a violent crime obviously especially murder  \n\n the   onus will now be on that individual to convince the court\n\nwhy he or she should not be dealt with as an adult criminal in adult court\n\nand subject to the tougher penalties of law\n That's an important change because obviously under the previous\n\nlegislation or the current legislation that we seek to amend the reverse is\n\ntrue\n A sixteen or seventeen year old convicted even of murder is dealt\n\nwith on a much more lenient basis and is not tried in adult court\n And this legislation will correct, what I think most Canadians\n\nconsider to be    a   gross inequity in that area\n\n<,,>\n provision for murder or the\n\npenalty for murder Madam Speaker I would just recall for honourable members\n\n   and for Canadians generally that  , it\n\nstarted out at a mere three years for first degree murder\n we had a\n\n  we've had    a     sad situation a\n\nfew years ago where one young offender murdered I believe it was three people\n\nit was certainly more than one person and yet subject to a maximum total\n\npenalty of three years\n That was clearly not just and is clearly not adequate for a serious\n\ncrime like murder\n penalty went from three\n\nyears, within    the   last short period of time\n\nto five years, but this legislation    uh would \n\n allow    a doubling of that maximum\n\npenalty   up to ten years\n\n\n  murder     for first degree murder   ten\n\nyears is inadequate, and I suppose that's a debatable point but it's\n\ncertainly far more just    than the five-year\n\n  penalty    that it\n\n  will replace,\n in\n\n  uh in   that age category    will \n\n not be eligible for parole as early if convicted of murder\n In other words a young offender convicted of murder will now find\n\nit much more difficult, to earn parole than he or she has under the\n\ncurrent legislation\n\n\njust common sense    and   simple justice\n So as I say Madam Speaker Canadians know that there have been\n\nproblems    with the   Young Offenders Act and\n\n   they're   crying out for improvements and I\n\nthink the minister has offered major improvements, as the first step of a\n\ntwo-step process\n said during the uh\n\nelection campaign and as the minister and the Prime Minister have continued\n\nto say    and   members on uh this side of the\n\nHouse have continued to say since the uh election of October past, that\n\npublic safety must be the top priority as we address this issue\n Now let me be, completely fair and say that I've heard that\n\nstatement from all parts of the House and I agree with that that public\n\nsafety must be the first consideration when we're considering the justice\n\nsystem in any part of the justice system and that includes    uh    those   offenders\n\nwho are young Canadians  ,\n its first priority,\n However where perhaps I differ as a Liberal from some honourable\n\nmembers in the House is this\n This party and this minister and this legislation seeks to find a\n\nbalanced approach to this serious problem of youth crime\n\n\nlet's, throw them in jail for as long as we would any other adult throw\n\naway the key    and   uh let them rot in jail\n That's not uh the answer\n\n\n  I'm   displeased to say that I have, detected\n\nthat that is uh kind of the approach of certain honourable members\n And I would find it short-sighted because it's not a balanced\n\napproach,\n Legislation alone will not solve this problem\n It's certainly a key component of addressing this issue but it's\n\nnot enough in and of itself\n I think that we're very short-sighted as a nation if we don't seek\n\nto treat the root causes of youth crime the poverty that many if not most\n\nyoung offenders experience the very real poverty that most Canadians don't\n\nexperience a high percentage of young offenders have experienced in their\n\nlifetime the repeated family violence that they have experienced themselves\n\noften the victims of this violence both sexual and non-sexual violence,\n Racism is unfortunately a real problem unfortunately and young\n\noffenders who are from a minority group when you analyse their background and\n\nanalyze why they committed crime racism is a repeated theme  \n\n in   those particular uh young offenders from minority groups\n The whole question of illiteracy and dropping out of school\n I can tell you Madam Speaker as an educator for twenty-one years\n\nthat the first sign that you may have a potential young offender on your\n\nhands teachers will tell you    uh those   first\n\nsymptoms if you will are exhibited in classrooms at the youngest ages at the\n\nlowest grades,\n And of course obviously as with criminals of all ages substance\n\nabuse by young offenders is a major factor uh in why that they are involved\n\nin criminal activity\n\n\n  in   a brief phrase I think we could do no better\n\nthan describe the dysfunctional family or the breakdown in the family and in\n\ngood family values in this country in    I hope a\n\nminority   of families\n But an analysis of young offenders will show that a high percentage\n\nof them an overwhelming percentage of them come from dysfunctional families\n\nwhere there is not proper parental supervision where there is not proper\n\nparental inculcation of values with these young people\n And so in effect if you will as a society we reap what we sow\n And this party seeks to find a balanced approach so I applaud the\n\nminister and the legislation but I applaud the fact that he says time and\n\nagain when he speaks to the House that we have to treat the root causes of\n\ncrime otherwise we are not ultimately going to come up with an improvement in\n\nthis important area\n Sure we will lock away young offenders for a longer time at great\n\ncost to the nation but that will not solve the problem which we ultimately\n\nhope to improve upon\n And so Madam Speaker what we ought to do as a country and what the\n\nlegislation seeks to do in my view is   , while  \n\nimproving    the   legislation and coming up with\n\nmore realistic penalties it seeks to not only uh be reactive to young\n\noffenders but it seeks    to   uh put\n\npreventive action into place\n And the sharing of information among professionals uh police\n\nofficials school authorities that will be an important part of preventive\n\naction\n you know\n\nany teacher in this country knows there are young offenders in some cases\n\nviolent young offenders walking around the halls of that particular school\n And it's important that educators know that in the interests of the\n\nsafety of the other students in that facility and of indeed staff in that\n\nschool because it's a fact that there has been an increase in violent uh\n\ncrime in schools in this country and it concerns all of us\n\n\npleased to join in the debate today and as I say I applaud the minister for\n\nthe legislation\n It's a major first step in the right direction and we will await as\n\nall Canadians do the ultimate improvements in the Young Offenders Act\n,\n\n<$C>  It being six oh five P

critical to the health and well-being of tens of thousands of\n\nCanadians living in northern isolated communities\n And so this issue is one that uhh must concern us as a national\n\nlegislature    in   Canada\n Here in the south the issue of food distribution is not as\n\nsignificant for one or either uh of governments or residents\n Nutritious food is broadly available at supermarkets or corner\n\nstores throughout the areas in southern Canada and distribution of food\n\nproducts is left in the hands of the private sector with no demand, for or\n\nneed for government involvement\n However in the north the situation as the honourable member has\n\nindicated is dramatically different\n Many communities are, isolated and do not have year round\n\nsurface access so food supplies must be delivered, in some cases by air\n\n<,> in other cases uh by sea and perishable foods which as a rule are the\n\nmost nutritious    are   very difficult to arrange\n\nfor in some of these communities,\n The expense of transporting perishable foods to remote communities\n\nincreases their cost to consumers\n The honourable member provided the House with a list uh the variety\n\nof which I've seen in my northern experiences I must say\n Uh these areas are not only isolated but they're often economically\n\ndepressed\n In some communities unemployment is as high as eighty-five per cent\n\nuh and so many families are living on social assistance supplemented by \n\n  uh whatever commodities   they can\n\nharvest from the land,\n Mail\n\nProgram therefore is vitally important

{'text': "<$A>  It subsidizes the cost of shipping perishable nutritious foods\n\nto isolated northern communities and puts these basic necessities within the\n\nreach of northern families\n And uh on many of the flights that I have taken to various places in\n\nthe north I'm aware that    the   plane is in many\n\ncases filled with bread, eggs milk and other perishables that are shipped\n\nto these communities\n However even with the assistance of this program it's extremely\n\ndifficult for families to afford the proper and nutritious, uh food that\n\nis demanded and without the program it would be virtually impossible to do so\n And I again stress the list of prices that the honourable member uh\n\nlisted\n They are not exaggerated\n And I'm not exaggerating when I say the situation in the north would\n\nbe desperate    uh without this   program\n Government studies show that a family of four in isolated\n\ncommunities in the Northwest Territories would have to spend between two\n\nhundred and sixty to two hundred and eighty dollars a week or between\n\neighty-five and a hundred and ten per cent of their after-shelter income for\n\na basic diet\n That's about twice the cost of a comparable basic diet here in\n\nsouthern Canada\n I'd remind honourable members that Canada is a signatory to the\n\nUnited Nations declaration on the rights of the child, and one of those\n\nrights is the right to adequate nutrition\n Children should not go hungry especially in our country Madam\n\nSpeaker\n as to the\n\nneed for the program\n subsidation\n\nfor food distribution   subsidization for food distribution  \n\nor food costs should be\n Ah we stress that it is essential for the health of northern\n\nresidents\n I think it's also fair to say that the current program is achieving\n\nits intended purpose notwithstanding the suggestions made by the honourable\n\nmember\n The northern Food Mail Program is strongly supported by the\n\ncommunities it serves, and by the food distribution companies, the\n\nmerchants which form part of the   \n\ndistribution   system and of course consumers\n Canada Post which ships food products and other essential goods by\n\nair has been a willing and vital partner in the program,\n In spite of all that I commend the honourable member for Saint-Jean\n\nfor urging the government to reconsider the current, northern food\n\ndistribution system\n There's always room for improvement and governments should be\n\ncontinually looking at new approaches to program delivery\n I'm therefore extremely pleased to inform the House that the\n\ngovernment has already taken steps to re-evaluate this program\n In April the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development\n\n<,> and the Minister of Health committed their departments to a full review\n\nof this essential service for the next year,\n This review will build on an evaluation of the program that was\n\nundertaken by consultants last year\n It will include consultations with all the key stakeholders\n\nincluding, northern residents merchants air carriers provincial and\n\nterritorial governments and aboriginal organizations\n Madam Speaker this consultation process is fully in keeping with\n\nthe Red Book  commitment and I know the\n\nhonourable member has read the Red Book extensively to ensure that aboriginal\n\npeople are fully involved in decisions that affect their lives\n Toward this end, regional consultation meetings will be held in\n\nthe north this September and October\n Written views and recommendations will also be accepted by the\n\ngovernment,\n My honourable colleague will be particularly pleased to hear that\n\nan interdepartmental committee is currently looking at terms of reference to\n\nguide this review\n In addition to Health Canada and Indian and Northern Affairs Canada\n\nthe committee has representations from the Departments of Finance Agriculture\n\nand Human Resources Development the Treasury Board and the Privy Council\n\nOffice\n Madam Speaker this review will look at the issue of food\n\ndistribution in the north from a very broad    perspective\n\n \n It will not just consider how much money is being spent, or\n\nneeds to be spent under the northern Food Mail Program\n It will address the fundamental question of whether or not this is\n\nthe best way to ensure that northerners can meet their needs for food and\n\nother essential goods that are currently shipped under the program\n It will review alternatives for food distribution and food costs\n\nsubsidization including income support to ensure that people have money to\n\nbuy the essential foods\n The role of local food production processing and inter-settlement\n\ntrade will also be considered\n The review may in the end tell us that the essential structure of\n\nthe program is solid but that some fine tuning is needed\n It may tell us that a completely new approach is needed or that the\n\nprogram should be developed, uh    and   looked\n\nafter by another level of government or indeed by an independent organization\n In the meantime Madam Speaker, honourable members have the\n\ngovernment's assurance that funding for the program in its current format\n\nwill continue\n In nineteen ninety-four and ninety-five, a total of fourteen\n\npoint one million dollars will be available for the Food Mail Program\n The bulk of this some thirteen point six million dollars will come\n\nfrom the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development\n det\n\n   contributed   by Health Canada\n This level of funding should be sufficient to maintain the postage\n\nrates at the current levels until March thirty-first nineteen ninety-five\n conclusion Madam Speaker I\n\nwant to say that, I of course am not an expert on this subject\n I've had some experience as I have indicated in the course of my\n\nremarks but I'm not an expert and the remarks that I am alluding to and that\n\nI am  in part reading have been prepared for the Parliamentary\n\nSecretary to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development who is\n\ntied up in a committee tonight    and is\n\nunable   to be here in the House to deliver this particular speech\n So I'm pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the speech\n\nreally on his behalf and contribute to the debate on behalf of the uh\n\ngovernment\n would like to say in\n\nconclusion that this House must acknowledge that the northern Food Mail\n\nProgram has proven to be an effective and efficient way of making food and\n\nother essential goods more affordable    in  \n\nisolated northern communities\n As a member who travels there occasionally I am pleased to support\n\nit\n And I'm confident that if any improvements can be made either in\n\nthe short term or in the long term they will be identified in the course of\n\nthe review that the government    has   under way at\n\nthe moment and which will be reporting in due course\n I thank the honourable member for raising this issue in the House\n\n,\n\n<$C>  The honourable member for Wetaskiwin,\n\n<$B>  Thank you Madam Speaker,\n I'm uh pleased to be able to participate in this debate uh, on\n\nthe motion presented by my honourable colleague the member from Saint-Jean\n The motion before us today uh, asks the government to make food\n\ndistribution in Canada's    uh north   more\n\neffective and uh more economical\n couldn't help but notice\n\nthat uh, the uh member who spoke just before me   \n\nwe must have   been doing research from exactly the same uh material\n\nMadam Speaker because uh his speech sounded an awful lot like the one that\n\nI'm about to deliver,\n We in the Reform Party are always looking for ways to improve on\n\nexisting programs\n I'd like to commend the\n\nhonourable member for his initiative in bringing this motion uh forward,\n Since the nineteen sixties the federal government in conjunction\n\nwith the uhm post office has made an effort to supply uh,    isolated northern  \n\ncommunities with affordable, fresh produce\n Under the Northern, Air Stage Program the Department of Indian\n\nand Northern Affairs  pays Canada Post a subsidy to cover a portion of the cost of\n\nbringing nutritious mostly perishable food to communities that have no year\n\nround road or rail access,\n Approximately a hundred and twenty-five communities serving about\n\neighty-six thousand people are eligible under this program\n As has been referred to here previously Madam Speaker the nineteen\n\nninety-four fiscal year this food mail subsidy will amount to some fourteen\n\npoint one million dollars\n Of this thirteen point six, million will be coming from the\n\nDepartment of Indian and Northern Affairs with about a half a million dollars\n\ncoming from the Department of Health,\n The residents of Canada's north face not only higher retail prices\n\nthan we southerners, but uhm, they also have a critical employment\n\nprogram,\n in nature\n\n \n Most work that is in that area\n census\n\nshowed that only thirty-five per cent of the aboriginal population fifteen\n\nyears of age or older were employed compared to sixty per cent for all of\n\nCanada in the same age category,\n So of course a high unemployment rate means a lower annual wage and\n\n ultimately less purchasing power,\n The high cost of transporting goods in the north even with the\n\ngovernment subsidized Food Mail Program results in higher consumer prices\n A family of four and uh also has been alluded to here earlier in\n\nthese isolated communities    in the   Northwest\n\nTerritories would have to spend between two hundred and sixty and two hundred\n\nand eighty dollars per week, just for a basic diet\n And uh uh it's at least twice as much as we would have to spend in\n\nsouthern Canada for the same, diet,\n A study by the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, Canada\n\nconducted in nineteen ninety concluded that by reducing the merchant's\n\ntransportation costs the air strategy, subsidy has been an effective means\n\nof keeping the prices of food and other goods in remote areas lower than they\n\notherwise would be,\n The study also found that an elimination of the subsidy would\n\nlikely result in higher social assistance costs Madam Speaker higher health\n\ncare costs and an increase in isolated post allowances for government\n\nemployees,\n But Madam Speaker when the Department of Indian and Northern\n\nAffairs launched this study in nineteen ninety there were no uh apparent\n\nalternatives\n Today I believe that uh as was indicated by my honourable friend\n\nthere may be a practical cost-effective solution for at least part of this\n\nproblem\n\n Excuse me\n There is a ah corporation Madam Speaker as was also alluded to by\n\nthe mover of this motion, that is prepared to establish a food\n\ndistribution network\n And uh certainly don't want to uh, uh propose one corporation\n\nover another Madam Speaker but uh where there is one there's likely to be\n\nothers\n This corporation plans to subsidize or to supply food from a\n\ncentral distribution centre in Iqaluit, ,\n I didn't say that right,\n\n\n  In   Iqaluit which would at the outset serve some\n\nthirty-eight northern communities,  \n This unique Canadian enterprise predicts that the price of food\n\nproducts in the north could be reduced by ten to twenty per cent,\n This will be possible because of their plan to reduce\n\ntransportation costs and because their purchasing power will enable them to\n\nnegotiate lower prices and to pass the savings on to the customers,\n Now this company expects to save on transportation costs by\n\nregrouping products and chartering aircraft that would carry up to\n\nseventy-five thousand dollars worth of merchandise per flight\n to be a\n\nfood wholesaler they estimate that they can receive eighty-eight per cent of\n\nthe market share in two years by supplying perishable   \n\n<,> uh food products   and other consumer merchandise needed by\n\nnorthern residents but not currently available at reasonable prices,\n\n\n  estimated   to be some one million six hundred and fifty\n\nthousand dollars\n\n\n financing Madam Speaker it is safe to say that uh they would probably\n\nneed some government uh loan guarantee in order to uhm get them started", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b6345614-07c4-4cd2-93bd-c608b9de3296', 'added':

pleased to see\n\nthat this group has taken the initiative to provide a better service to at\n\nleast some of the isolated northern communities\n And to me it sounds like ah an excellent viable

the food and the diet ultimately of the people who live in the\n\nnorth\n Thank you Madam Speaker\n\n<$C>  The honourable member for Saskatoon-Dundurn\n\n<$B>  Thank you Madam Speaker\n I rise to address the House on the motion put forth by the\n\nhonourable member for Saint-Jean,\n As my honourable colleague has explained the Northern Air Stage\n\nProgram is critical to the good health of many thousands of people living in\n\nremote northern communities\n It is also a federal initiative that is not well known to many\n\nCanadians or to their representatives in this House\n I would like to take this opportunity to provide some background on\n\nthe program so that honourable members can fully appreciate its importance\n The principal objective of the northern air stage program is to\n\nachieve, food security in isolated northern communities\n Food security is defined as a condition in which all people at all\n\ntimes have access to safe nutritiously adequate and personally acceptable\n\nfoods in a manner which maintains human dignity\n Food security poses special challenges in northern Canada where\n\nsouthern food is very expensive and retail competition is extremely limited\n There are also increasing pressures on traditional food sources as\n\nwell as concern about contaminants in the food chain\n Hunting itself is expensive especially for people who are already\n\nin low-paying jobs or are receiving social assistance\n Under the Northern Air Stage Program Madam Speaker the Department\n\nof Indian Affairs and Northern Development makes payments to Canada Post to\n\nsubsidize the cost of providing air parcel service to communities that are\n\nnot accessible by year round surface transportation\n This payment covers between fifty and sixty per cent of the cost of\n\nsending these parcels most of which are food items which is why the program\n\nis more commonly referred to as the northern Food Mail Program\n This program has become a vital element of the northern food\n\ndistribution system\n It ensures that supplies of nutritious perishable food are\n\ndelivered to about forty-five Inuit communities in the Northwest Territories\n\nnorthern Quebec, and Labrador\n It also serves about sixty isolated First Nation communities in the\n\nJames Bay region of Quebec, in Ontario, Manitoba Saskatchewan and the\n\nNorthwest Territories and about twenty mainly non-aboriginal communities in\n\nLabrador and the north shore region of Quebec\n In total some eighty-six thousand Canadians depend on the program\n Madam Speaker in nineteen eighty-nine the previous government\n\nannounced that the Food Mail Program would be phased out after more than two\n\ndecades of existence\n As might be expected this announcement was met with a great deal of\n\nopposition both in the north and in this House and the government decided\n\ninstead to undertake a major review of the program\n As a result of this review steps have been taken to make the\n\nprogram more equitable in terms of the subsidization rates paid for parcel\n\ndelivery to communities in the Northwest Territories compared to the\n\nprovinces\n The postage rates for shipments to the territories had\n\ntraditionally been about three times as high as in the provinces\n Important changes have also been made in how funding is applied\n The lowest postage rates are now provided for nutritious perishable\n\nfood, and food of little nutritional value has been disqualified from\n\nfunding\n As well shipments of alcohol and tobacco products are not\n\nsubsidized under this program\n commercial air cargo\n\nservice winter roads or seasonal marine service for the re-supply of these\n\nitems\n As a result of these changes Canada Post now charges eighty cents\n\nper kilogram plus seventy-five cents per parcel for nutritious perishable\n\nfood deliveries to all remote northern communities\n Non-perishable food and non-food items can be mailed to isolated\n\ncommunities in the northern parts of the provinces for one dollar per\n\nkilogram plus seventy-five cents per parcel\n In the territories the rate for these items has been maintained at\n\ntwo dollars and fifteen cents per kilogram plus seventy five cents per parcel\n Madam Speaker these changes have helped to reduce the prices of\n\nperishable food in the Northwest Territories\n In some communities there has been a fairly significant reduction\n\nin the total cost of the basic northern food basket for a family of four\n for example\n\nthe cost of this basket    decreased   by\n\nmore than thirty dollars between nineteen ninety-one and nineteen\n\nninety-three\n Unfortunately there are many communities in which increases in the\n\ncost of non-perishable food have offset the reductions in the cost of\n\nperishables,\n The lack of retail competition in many communities also continues\n\nto affect food prices\n Broughton Island where the local co-operative closed leaving only\n\none store in the community the cost of the northern food basket actually\n\nincreased by forty dollars between nineteen    ninety-two\n\n  and nineteen ninety-three despite the reduction in postal rates for\n\nperishables\n\n\nperspective Madam Speaker consumption of perishable food in Inuit communities\n\nin the Northwest Territories has increased significantly since the postage\n\nrates began to decline in October nineteen ninety-one\n In nineteen ninety-one ninety-two Canada Post shipped seven hundred\n\nand fifty-eight tonnes of perishable food to the ten communities in the\n\nBaffin region which have traditionally been on the food mail system\n The following year when postage rates were further reduced these\n\nshipments increased by more than thirty-five per cent to a thousand and forty\n\ntonnes\n Despite this increased consumption there is still a great deal of\n\nroom for improvement\n A government survey of isolated aboriginal communities taken in\n\nnineteen ninety-one and    nineteen ninety-three \n\n shows that the per capita consumption of store-bought perishable food\n\ncontinues to be much lower in the north than in southern Canada\n As a result the average intake of vitamin A and calcium is far\n\nbelow recommended levels and the average consumption of sugar in all\n\ncommunities is extremely high\n This is obviously undermining the health of northern residents\n It is also evident that high food costs continue to be the major\n\nimpediment to improved diets in the north\n In the same survey I mentioned a moment ago between forty and fifty\n\nper cent of women reported that they were extremely concerned about not\n\nhaving enough money for food\n In most communities this was a greater concern than alcohol and\n\ndrug abuse and family violence\n The situation is obviously extremely difficult Madam Speaker but\n\nwithout the Food Mail Program or some alternative it could be much worse\n It is clear that some form of subsidization must continue for\n\nshipments of nutritious perishable food items to isolated northern\n\ncommunities\n The residents of these communities already have many problems to\n\ndeal with poverty overcrowding family violence  \n\n uh alcohol and substance abuse   cultural disruption gambling and\n\nso on\n Hunger and poor health brought on by an inadequate food supply\n\nshould not be added to the list\n I want to reiterate that the government has already taken the\n\naction proposed by the honourable member for Saint-Jean,\n An interdepartmental committee is now developing the terms of\n\nreference for a fundamental review of the Food Mail Program for the next year\n I would urge my honourable colleagues to support this important\n\ninitiative\n The Food Mail Program costs each Canadian taxpayer an average of\n\nabout one cent per week\n This is a very small price to pay considering the enormous impact\n\nthe program has on the health and the well-being of eighty-six thousand\n\nCanadians\n,\n\n<$C> \n\n<$D> \n\n<$C>  There being no further members rising for debate and the\n\nmotion not being designated as a votable item the time provided for the\n\nconsideration of Private Members\' Business has now expired and the order is\n\ndropped from the Order Paper pursuant to Standing Order ninety-six one \n\n\n\n<$C>  The honourable member for Crowfoot,\n\n<$A> ,\n I have listened to the debates, on this bill, and, I would\n\nlike to direct the attention of the House, to one important factor that I\n\nthink has been left out,    of the   speeches\n\nthat I\'ve heard, so far, and that is simply this,\n\n\nthis government and past governments   have been expecting the\n\njustice system to do something that it was never designed to do,\n The justice system cannot prevent, dysfunctional families\n The justice system cannot prevent the negative aspects of society\n\nthat lead to crime\n\n\nprotect   society against those individuals who move towards a life\n\nof crime and begin to commit criminal acts and to threaten the lives and the\n\nproperty of the people of this country\n That\'s the role of the justice system,\n And what the social engineers have done for the last twenty years\n\n<,> has attempted to create a dual animal of some sort within the justice\n\nsystem that it was somehow responsible, to prevent crime\n Well that\'s not what it was designed to do\n There are other programs designed to keep people out, of crime\n\n<,>\n Social programs our educational systems our churches and other\n\norganizations they\'re the ones designed to input into our young people the\n\ningredients needed for them to become successful productive human beings who\n\nrespect the law and who will not violate the law\n But the justice system is not designed to do that, Madam Speaker\n\n<,,>\n Madam Speaker the attempts by the social\n\nengineers over the last twenty years to change the fundamental role of the\n\njustice system has corrupted the justice system, it has corrupted the\n\nsystem to the point where it is no longer protecting the lives, and the\n\nproperty of the citizens of this country,\n We have just heard recently, from Assistant Commissioner Rod\n\nStamler claiming, that there\'s been such interference under the Mulroney\n\nadministration in the administration of the R C M P  as to impact upon the ability of the force, to\n\nconduct investigations into political corruption,\n We look at the Allan Eagleson case as another example of the\n\ncorruption of our justice system and those, people responsible for its\n\nproper and fair, administration\n Where evidence was laid before the authorities within this country\n\nnothing was done about it, until the U S authorities begin to investigate\n Only then did the authorities in this country begin to take a\n\nproper look at the evidence that was before them', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source':

we picked up some beer from there\n\n<$A> \n\n you would   get\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  Do you know how many times you did that\n\n<$B> \n\nbeer throughout the game so, maybe twice\n\n<$A>  And uh so and yeah what time were you planning to be finished\n\nyour game\n What time did you guys think you'd be done\n\n<$B>  Well usually it's uh uh eighteen holes but Texas Scramble is\n\na little faster

changed my shoes and so on I went back\n\n   for   the banquet, which started at six,\n\nsix thirty\n came up to\n\nme and says you know uh there's been a complaint about you on the golf course\n\n<,> and uh that's where he says you know just, and I said well   you know  let's   talk about it and he says no let's\n\njust, forget it and uh, uh, better leave he said,\n\n\n<$A>  So that's what you did\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  So I gather that you must have been quite confused at that\n\npoint\n\n<$B>  I was uhm, embarrassed, yeah\n\n<$A>  you\n\nwere golfing with did they know what had happened    that you were  , were they nearby or did you tell\n\nthem\n\n<$B>  I didn't have a chance to talk to them\n I was actually embarrassed\n\n<$A>  And you left\n\n<$B>  That's right\n\n<$A>  So you don't know whether the rest of your uh group found out\n\n<$B>  No\n\n<$A>  don't know anything\n\nabout that\n\n<$B>  No\n\n<$A>  the\n\nday    ,  that   you described uhm are\n\nyou able to tell us whether or not at that point the people that you were\n\ngolfing with whether or not they were drinking\n Were they also\n\n<$B> \n\n   couple of   drinks, yeah\n\n<$A>  They were\n\n\n<$B> , same, same yeah\n\n<$A> \n\n\n, are good with faces but I gather, the first time that uh  Jane\n\n came round you didn't recognize her\n\n<$B>  No\n\n<$A> \n\n  that   she came by or the time  \n\n that   <unclear> two or three words </unclear> are talking about\n\nuh again you didn't recognize her, after she'd used your name\n\n<$B>  I\n\n  looked at her and I thought oh    I   \n\n  kind of   know her maybe and so I went up to her\n\nand we started talking and that's where, it all came back to me\n\n<$A>  Okay, now when you went up to her and started talking to\n\nher uhh exactly what did you talk about\n\n<$B> \n\nand I told her I was engaged, uh talked to her    to see if she   was still going out with uh,    uh his name is,     Mike    uh I    don't know\n\n  his last name,  Simpson \n\n<$A>  And uh uhm, when you were you were standing by her cart\n\nwhile she was sitting in it and you were  drinking  with her\n\n<$B>  That's right\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  No\n\n<$A> \n\npeople that you were golfing with were also there\n\n<$B>  Yes\n Steve\n\n were nearby as well\n\n<$B> \n Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  it possible that someone\n\nwas purchasing something from her, something to drink, at that time\n you just didn't see anything like\n\nthat happen\n\n<$B>  No\n No\n\n<$A>  You don't know\n\n<$B>  No I don't know\n\n<$A>  Okay\n Uh so the other people that you were with would have been around\n\nfor the  rest of  that conversation\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And uh uhm how much time did you actually spend talking to\n\nher,\n\n<$B>  like I\n\nsaid  we had just   shot, uhm our   we just drove our\n\nballs   and that's putting the club away then I went and talked to\n\nher and then those guys finished putting their clubs away and then    they   took off and then that's when I asked her for\n\na ride\n\n<$A>  Did they tell you that they were leaving\n\n<$B>  here\n\n<$A>  Is there a reason why, they left without you\n\n<$B>  They were probably, bugging,\n,\n They left,\n\n<$A>  uh it's your evidence\n\n  uh,  that    Jane  agreed to give you\n\na ride\n\n<$B>  That's right\n went on the\n\ncart if she    would have   told me no \n\n<$A>  You\n\nsay you   drove to this other spot I gather that once you were there\n\nyou were close to where  Jane  was the whole time that she was at that\n\nlocation\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  Is that right\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  So anything that happened in relation to her you would have\n\nobserved\n\n<$B>  I thought I did\n\n<$A> \n\njust be clear for us\n Is there some way you could have missed something that happened\n\n<$B> \n\nweren't concentrating on her\n Like we were golfing uhm\n the conversation with\n\n Frank Lawson    uh  I didn't   hear or\n\noverhear anything of that kind so\n\n<$A> \n\nwhat uh is   what you're

Okay alright,\n hadn't moved, but he was having a conversation\n\nwith her from your cart\n Is that what you're saying\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  What part of your cart was he at then\n\n<$B>  cart\n\n<$A>  On the driver's by the driver's\n\n<$B>  Yeah the driver's side yeah cos he was driving\n\n<$A>  and you say that you were\n\nbehind the cart looking at your golf clubs\n\n<$B>  That's right\n\n<$A>  And you're saying that you could not hear what they were\n\nsaying to each other\n\n<$B>  I wasn't paying attention,\n\n\n<$A>  at that\n\ntime,\n\n<$B>  At their cart\n\n<$A>  What were they doing at their cart\n\n<$B>  They were either at their clubs or they were sitting in their\n\ncart\n They were right by their cart I know\n\n<$A>  So everybody was in a fairly small area right\n\n<$B>  Yeah yeah\n\n<$A>  Within hearing distance of one another\n\n<$B>  Yeah yeah should yeah\n\n<$A>  would affect\n\n uh  would affect   someone's ability to hear  do you think\n\n\n\n<$B>  I didn't pay any attention so I didn't hear, anything so\n\n<,> I didn't hear anything\n\n<$A>  Okay,\n And uh, tell me again why you went back and saw her,\n Why did you go back to where she was\n\n<$B>  To find out what was going on uh\n\n<$A>  Going on about what\n\n<$B> \n\n\n  I went   along too and that's where she was\n\nstanding\n\n<$A>  Which side of the cart was she on\n\n<$B>  On the driver's side\n\n<$A>  Okay, and so which side of the cart were you on,\n\n<$B>  I went to the driver's side\n\n<$A> \n\n,  around the back of her cart,\n the driver's side\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  That's right,\n\n<$A>  You say she was already out of her cart at that point\n\n<$B>  That's right\n\n<$A>  You didn't drag her out\n\n<$B>  No\n\n<$A> \n And uh did you find out what was going on\n\n<$B>  No\n\n<$A>  Why not,\n\n<$B>  Cos I, basically, I don't\n\n\n  that's when  , I made the comment of, her behind\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n were you wanting to give\n\nher one more hug \n\n<$B>  did\n\n<$A>  to\n\n  to   your friends\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n I was just being nice\n\n<$A>  Okay\n Did they react in any way, to what you had to say\n\n<$B>  they kind of laughed\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  No they oh okay whatever,\n\n<$A>  So now as far as you're concerned uhm, uh that's about all\n\nthat happened\n\n<$B>  That's right\n\n<$A>  Well what point was it that you uhm could smell her and tell\n\nher that she had a nice perfume on\n\n<$B>  That's the time when I, uh gave her the last hug when I\n\ncomplimented her behind\n\n<$A>  tell\n\nher about her perfume\n Was that before or after you commented on her rear end,\n\n<$B>  Uh probably before yeah\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n uh was   the compliment of her behind\n\n<$A> \n And so what happened\n What's the very next thing that happened\n I want you to be really clear if you can recall after you were\n\nhugging her and made the comment what's the very next thing that happened\n\n<$B>  I went back to my clubs she got in her cart, said goodbye\n\nand she was on her way out and she  waved  this way    as she was going up the hill  \n\n<$A>  So when you went back to your cart did you walk around behind\n\n<,> her cart\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  Back over to where your cart was\n\n<$B>  That's right\n\n<$A>  to\n\nwhat part of your cart\n\n<$B>  behind of our, cart\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  So you went to the back\n\n<$B>  That's right\n\n<$A>  was still, where\n\n<$B>  Beside our cart\n\n<$A>  Steve\n\n were still, by their cart\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  in the same\n\nposition saw you had gone over, and hugged,  Jane  and so on\n\n<$B> , five ten seconds all\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  Now the point as she was driving away you say they were all\n\nin the same position and you had moved back\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  So I gather that uh while you were concentrating\n\n\n  Jane  ran over someone's foot while you were concentrating on\n\nyour clubs as you described,\n\n<$B>  No she wasn't going anywhere\n\n<$A>  couldn't have\n\nhappened while you were there\n Is that what you're saying\n Is that your evidence\n\n<$B>  didn't see\n I didn't pay no attention so I don't know\n I don't know\n\n<$A>  You don't know whether it happened or not\n\n<$B> ,\n\n<$A>  what\n\nopportunity  ,\n\n<$B>  To my knowledge,\n To my knowledge\n\n<$A>  Okay well is there some period of time that you weren't\n\npaying attention that it could've happened\n Is that why you're not sure\n\n<$B>  Well I was close enough, I would've heard something cos\n\n<,> the cart is heavy enough on the foot that you would've felt it\n\n<$A> \n\ndrive over someone's foot or didn't she\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  I gather that uh since this incident has happened you've had\n\nthe opportunity to talk to your golfing partners\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And to discuss that day and how things went\n\n<$B>  Definitely,\n a serious charge,\n\n<$A>  End of cross\n\nexamination  \n\n\n\n<$A>  is\n\nthat right\n\n<$B>

So those are two chemical, formulations that were made at\n\nthe plant  ,  that you're aware of\n\n<$B> \n Yes sir\n\n<$A> \n\nGrey-Tootoo  would he give it to you in writing\n\n<$B>  Uh no sir\n stipulate what to put in\n\nthere\n\n<$A>  In other words so it wasn't written down\n\n<$B>  No\n Well,\n No not really\n\n<$A>  All right\n he was\n\nable to give you those instructions\n\n<$B> \n\nformula doesn't turn out right and he gives the instructions,\n I mean it's his formula\n saying so\n\nyes we did formulate under his instructions\n\n<$A>  All right\n So\n So just to back him up a little bit\n You indicated that you used to do this mixing when he was\n\nincoherent\n Is that so\n\n<$B>  Sir you have to understand that seventy-five percent of the\n\ntime he was incoherent yes\n\n<$A>  All right\n answer is that when\n\nhe was incoherent you would have to do the mixing\n\n<$B>  Well or the production people yes sir\n\n<$A>  Okay,\n But even though he was incoherent he would be able to give you the\n\nformula to mix,\n\n<$B>  I would like to know it was the right formula sir\n I had to operate by his instructions\n\n<$A>  to\n\n<$B> \n I hope so yes\n\n<$A>  you were able to\n\ncomprehend, what he gave you\n\n<$B>  It was trying at times\n\n<$A>  comprehend\n\n  it and you  did make the mixture\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yes sir\n\n<$A>  All right\n And, that's the product that was subsequently sold\n as\n\n  the  sales  manager \n\n<$B> \n It was reworked and sold back to the people that it was supposed\n\nto have been sold to in the beginning yes sir\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n\n<$B>  No sir,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  No sir\n\n<$A>  Who sold it\n\n<$B> \n\nmainland \n\n<$A>  Okay\n himself sold it\n\n<$B>  I'm sure he did\n\n<$A>  All right\n\n\n<$B>  That was just sort of stock that didn't go anywhere\n\n<$A> \n None of it was sold in other words\n\n<$B>  Well it's a good bit of chemicals\n I'm not too sure of the quantities sir\n\n<$A> \n Did you arrange for the sale of any of it\n\n<$B>  Uhm no\n He woud do that himself\n\n<$A>  All right\n So he sold that as well\n\n<$B>  Yes sir\n\n<$A>  Okay\n Now in addition to those to products did you see any other\n\nproducts manufactured, at the chemical plant in  Macaroon  in the\n\ntime you worked there whether it be as  Redline>  Cryozine  or \n\nRevothine ,\n\n<$B> \n\nelectr    electric   uh <unclear> word </unclear> electric\n\n six hundred  that they call <unclear> word </unclear> electric  six\n\nhundred  <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n Excuse me\n\n<$A>  All right\n\n<$B>  I'll back up\n\n<$A>  Certainly\n\n<$B>  The products\n of course\n\n\n <-> application </>   uh  S G Twenties  and\n\n greases  and  <unclear> word </unclear>  \n\n<$A>  so there were other products manufactured\n\nin addition to  Drill Splash  and  Revex \n\n\n  state one other\n\n\n<$B> \n\ngo for  Fadi \n\n\n<$A>  What do you call it\n\n<$B>  F A D I\n\n  \n\n<$A> , were you involved in\n\nthe mixing and manufacture of  Fadi \n\n<$B>  Yes sir\n\n<$A> \n\ninstruct as to how that was to be mixed\n\n<$B>  No sir\n\n\n<$A>  Oh\n told you the formulation that was\n\nnecessary to manufacture  Fadi \n\n<$B>  He just told us what had to go into it\n We put it in there\n Yes\n\n<$A> \n today\n\n<$B>  Uhm yes sir\n\n<$A>  You now know\n\n<$B>  Yes sir\n\n<$A>  How would it be\n Is that because of formulations you, took from him\n\n<$B>  No sir\n and uhm\n\nother companies that he's gotten his formulas from\n\n<$A>  Okay\n now\n\n<$B>  One six five\n This is our combination is five hundred\n Five uh\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  you show on your product that it's\n\nmanufactured here\n\n<$B>  Uh yes sir\n Uhm no I don't think we do sir\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  we make the product here\n It's you know\n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n<$B> \n Lots of it we do\n Yes sir\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Yes sir\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Yes sir\n We buy the base product bring it here and manufacture it\n\n<$A>  All right\n So that's\n\n<$B>  No problem\n\n<$A> \n\nRedline  Chemicals  Cryozine  and  Revothine \n Is that right\n\n<$B> \n\nRedline  and   that  went over    uhm to\n\n  Korea\n\n<$A> \n\n\nfor the mixture\n\n<$B> \n Yes sir\n\n<$A>  And are you using the identical mixture he used then\n\n<$B>  No sir,\n\n<$A>  Do you remember what he used\n\n<$B>  I haven't got a\n Can't remember\n I know it doesn't work\n\n<$A>  Well I didn't ask you that\n Okay\n\n\n<$B>  it's sitting in Korea sir and I was just\n\n  there \n\n<$A> \n I asked you, not if it worked or not,\n Okay\n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm\n Did I manufacture it\n\n<$A>  Yes sir\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n Okay\n On his instructions\n\n<$B>  On his instructions\n\n<$A>  And was he incoherent when he instructed you on that,\n\n<$B>  Mhh I couldn't say sir\n\n<$A>  All right,\n\n<$B>  General yes\n\n<$A>  Generally yes\n\n<$B>  Mhh hmm\n\n<$A>  Okay,\n he was drunk seventy-five\n\npercent   of the time  \n\n<$B>  four o'clock\n Yes sir\n\n<$A>

Correct\n\n<$A>  So you haven't had a lot of time to look through them think\n\nabout them or\n\n<$B>  These particular reports\n\n<$A>  Ya\n\n<$B>  They're fairly short uh but I honestly haven't memorized\n\nevery word or every detail      in   the two\n\n reports  \n\n<$A>  show me\n\n in their words  ah what    the \n\n diagnosis was in February of this year\n\n<$B> \n\n word\n\n</unclear> underneath that in actual fact that's incorrect\n uh the word depression\n\n  <unclear> word </unclear> is referring to the  Meyertown \n\n<,> Remand Centre\n, uh\n\nspecifies in regards to, the diagnosis at that time which I presume is\n\nreferring to  R T D  <unclear> two or three words </unclear> all the\n\nsame paragraph uh uh comments on <unclear> word </unclear>  abuse \n\ndisorder adjustment disorder with depressive mood  \n\n anti   - social personality disorder\n\n<$A>  Okay\n So there's no diagnosis of any major depression at that time\n\n<$B>  Right\n\n\nadjustment disorder with depressive    mood  \n And I did state I wasn't sure whether a diagnosis of major\n\ndepression had been made or not\n\n<$A>  Okay\n I'll just ask you again\n Based on what that report says you agree with me there's no\n\ndiagnosis, of major depression at that time\n\n<$B>  Correct\n\n<$A>  Because that would show up under axis one and major\n\ndepression is a particular diagnosis with criminal <unclear> two words\n\n</unclear>\n\n<$B>  Correct\n\n<$A>  And would you agree with me that uh psychiatrists who are\n\nactually dealing with a patient and treating him at that time are probably in\n\na better position to uh  make an assessment  than someone who comes in\n\nseveral months after the fact\n\n<$B>  I would concur\n What's kind of puzzling is that he remain on Elavil\n Looks like a hundred and fifty milligrams which is a treatment for\n\nmajor depression,\n\n<$A>  Are you saying that's the only time that medication can be\n\nprescribed\n\n<$B>  At that sort of dose that would be the medical indication for\n\nprescribing such a medication\n\n<$A>  Well you're not saying that that's the only reason\n The only thing you've ever prescribed Elavil for is major\n\ndepression are you\n\n<$B>  I would prescribe it for uh chronic pain fibromyalgia\n Uhm usually the dosage is fifty to seventy-five sometimes a\n\nhundred milligrams\n Uh this would be an unusual dose to be used in anything but uh\n\nsuspected major depression or for confirmed major depression\n\n<$A>  So I guess you agree with me that, that is not the only\n\nthing you can prescribe that medication for  would you \n There are other things besides major depression that it's used for\n\n<$B>  Certainly\n\n<$A>  So I think you said this morning you thought it would be\n\nunethical for a doctor to prescribe that medication, for anything other\n\nthan major depression\n Maybe I misunderstood you\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nnot true then\n\n<$B>  You may have misunderstood me\n believe I stated that I have\n\nserious concerns about a doctor prescribing that kind of medication to\n\nsomeone with a substance abuse problem who doesn't have major depression\n\n<$A>  That medication is

be the case\n\n<$A>  And you have no reason then to, quarrel with their\n\nassessment that there was no major depression at that time\n\n<$B>  I don't know if I'm saying that there was no reason\n It seems there are a number of clinical indicators that suggest\n\nmajor depression was a possibility uh but I wasn't there and I haven't\n\nreviewed the records so I couldn't really say\n can hypothesize and speculate\n\nbut I can't say definitively that yes he was depressed cos I saw that he was\n\ndepressed\n\n<$A>  But everything you've seen would indicate that the indication\n\nwas he was not depressed\n He's had an adjustment disorder with depressive mood which is a\n\ndifferent\n\n<$B>  If I could, stand to correct yourself\n I believe earlier on I'd stated uh that I think what happened was\n\nhe developed a major depression, in approximately November or early\n\nDecember which was subsequently treated with an anti-depressant for\n\ndepression reason and uh this uh later  resulted  in partial\n\nresolution of the major depression which would present as an adjustment\n\ndisorder with depressive mood\n Subsequent to further treatment uh the major depression resolved\n\ncompletely\n\n<$A>  Can you show me medical records to support that hypothesis\n\n<$B> \n\nhaven't had access   to the  R T   D  \n\n<$A>  that's purely your hypothesis on your

documentation is that correct\n\n<$B>  As are most of the diagnoses uh that uh psychiatrists do\n That's correct\n\n<$A> \n\nfile to see exactly what other psychiatrists had said about him and

if you accept it\n Nobody can ever be certain of anything I guess\n You have to decide whether you're going to accept it at face value\n\nor if you're going to be skeptical\n asking whether you accept it\n\n<$B> \n Certainly\n The other information I know is that in violent crimes\n\napproximately seventy percent of the perpetrators have uh a degree of amnesia\n\nrelated to the offense so amnesia    uh over\n\nthe duration of the offense   is not unusual so I guess the answer is\n\nyes I would accept that as a reasonable explanation\n\n<$A>  Was there anything in the letters that went against that,\n\nclaim to global amnesia\n\n<$B>  that I recall that\n\n   specifically   and conclusively would\n\ngo against but then again as I just said I didn't read every single word\n\n<$A>  Would you not think it would be important to go over those\n\nletters carefully to see whether or not there were things there that might\n\ncontradict    what Mister  Rabbitfoot   \n\nsaid to you\n\n<$B>  I think the letters are important as offering a general theme\n\n\n uh as you're   probably aware\n\n\n whole   letter uhm and uh certainly there's an item or two that\n\nuh would be of use to myself in  arriving at  a decision and <unclear>\n\ntwo or three words </unclear>  look at   that  \n\n<$A>  was there anything in the letters that you\n\nfound at all helpful in reaching your decision\n\n<$B> \n\nmanipl    manipulative   individual\n Uhm uh that he's uh getting a little desperate and is quite\n\nconcerned about his position\n\n\ninvolved   in a relationship with uh  Caroline Ticehouser \n could be mispronunciation of 'tomes'\n\n of endearment towards her\n A little overdone\n I think that's a, manipulative aspect of his personality kicking\n\nin there\n\n\n<$A> \n Sorry go ahead\n\n<$B>  He's persistent over time as well\n\n<$A>  Okay\n Uhm, so essentially you found the letters boring\n They're voluminous\n You didn't have a whole lot of time so you didn't read them all\n\n<$B>  I did\n I did\n I did go through\n I scanned them all but I did not read every word,\n\n<$A>  Did you find anything in the letters that indicated whether\n\nor not Mister  Rabbitfoot  had been sexually abused as a child,\n\n<$B>  Uhm, I can't recall\n\n<$A>  Well that's something you were making note of as being\n\nimportant I take it,\n\n<$B>  That's correct\n\n<$A>  to be\n\na risk indicator that would go against him being high-risk because he,\n\napparently was not sexually abused as a child\n\n<$B>  That's correct\n\n<$A>  about that\n\n<$B>  I did\n\n<$A>  What did he say\n\n<$B>  He said he had not been sexually abused as a child\n\n<$A>  And you believed him,\n\n<$B>  I have no evidence uhh to suggest otherwise\n a\n\nnumber of mistruths, so I don't know whether any one particular item can\n\nbe judged as factual or not\n\n<$A>  stated by him\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Ya I don't imagine you made any notes or kept track of\n\nletters so, you wouldn't have    any idea   from looking at this letter whether\n\nit's one you sort of scanned or whether it's simply one that you know    you  , read more carefully or not\n\n<$B>  Ya I don't know how many letters he had\n Maybe fifty\n\n<$A>  whole pile wasn't there\n\n<$B> \n There's a whole pile\n\n<$A>  And you're right\n They were pretty painful to have to read\n\n<$B>  Yes they were,\n\n<$A>  But in this uh

ya\n He\n\nmade  me go down on him cos I was just a kid, which is why I'm scared\n\nof   <unclear> two or three words </unclear>  \n\n<$A>  to indicate that there\n\nmight have been some sexual abuse as a child\n Would you agree,\n\n<$B>  has a little pattern in those\n\nletters of uh professing to be subjected to acts of sexual violence which\n\napparently are not true such as being raped, in prison and so I don't know\n\nif I can give ah this particular statement any more weight uh in terms of\n\nfactual content than I would the statement I had been raped, in prison\n\n<$A>  just ask my question\n\nagain\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> , answer my questions I'd sure\n\nappreciate that\n You agree with me that that particular phrase would indicate,\n\nthat he was sexually abused as a child\n\n<$B>  All that indicates is that he is stating he was sexually\n\nabused as a child,\n\n<$A>  He stated to you, one time he wasn't sexually abused as a\n\nchild\n\n\na child\n\n<$B> \n Correct\n\n<$A>  You have no better knowledge than me as to which one of those\n\nis true   do you \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And what you did point out that there were other allegations\n\nof sexual abuse in these letters referring to what happened to him at the\n\ninstitution\n\n<$B>  Correct\n\n<$A>  himself admitted to you that those\n\nwere false\n\n<$B>  Correct\n\n<$A>  never got into\n\ndiscussing this particular aspect of the letters because I take it you hadn't\n\nnoticed that or read that before just now\n\n<$B>  Correct\n Or if I had read it I have forgotten\n\n<$A>  Well you certainly didn't take it up with him and say what\n\nabout this part   here \n\n<$B>  did not\n\n<$A>  I'd find it interesting to know, whether that's true or\n\nnot\n\n<$B> \n\nor not \n\n<$A>  it is true then

or four words </unclear>\n\ninvestment\n And we talked about their, conditional investment in the company\n,\n One thing uh\n\n<$A>  Did they have any concerns\n\n<$B> , Their biggest concern was that uh, certainly from the\n\nstandpoint  ,  of the  , type of\n\ninvestment, they saw the  potential \n, for the tremendous\n\nopportunity, in this company\n\n\nbeing situated in  the right market, the company  could do very\n\n well\n\n\nsuccessful, so their major concern was   to <unclear> three or four\n\nwords </unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\nInvestments-R-Us  had\n\n<$B>  the\n\ninvestment  Investments-R-Us  had was  a third  shares  ,  of   uh nuclear industries <unclear> three or four\n\nwords </unclear>    which were   not at all\n\n<unclear> three or four words </unclear> and not <unclear> three or four\n\nwords </unclear>\n\n<$A>  Okay\n, uh\n\n<,> deal with those concerns\n Investments-R-Us\n\n\n\n<$B> , Yes we were\n\n<$A>  And did you deal with them, and alleviate them

</unclear>\n\n   with   uh  Peewee  <unclear> two or\n\nthree words </unclear>\n dealt with uh,\n\n Magic Beans     and   at one stage we\n\n simply  turned them over to uh, Mister  Humpty  to deal\n\nwith uh\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  actually\n\n\nword </unclear> uh another director <unclear> two or three words </unclear>\n\n\nlawyer,\n performed uh,\n\n you know  paperwork    with   uh <unclear>\n\nfour or five words </unclear>\n\n<$A>  Stock Exchange\n\n<$B>  Absolutely\n One of the first things we did was we applied,\n to find out\n\nwhat the Stock Exchange's, attitude would be towards us <unclear> word\n\n</unclear> involvement, <unclear> word </unclear>   Investments-R-Us\n\n  opportunity was    going to   complicate\n\nthe transaction, and whether or not  we could apply \n\n<$A> , And did you get that proof\n\n<$B>  Yes we did\n\n<$A> \n\nshowing you document dated October,  fourth  nineteen eighty-nine\n\nfrom the  Neverland , Stock Exchange directed to yourself

Uh,\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  word\n\n</unclear> clear  how many  shareholders, there was, <unclear>\n\ntwo or three words </unclear>  industries  but uh,\n Once we had reviewed the documents we were comfortable with the\n\nfact that there was only  really  one, common shareholder and that\n\nwas Mister  Humpty \n\n<$A>  withstanding the\n\neighth, which suggests that there are   two,  but there was\n\nonly one common shareholder in reality and that was Mister  Humpty \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> , That's right\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n\n  was the   money advanced in the fashion\n\ndescribed, uh in this document\n\n<$B> , No it was not\n\n\n<$A>  you describe how it was advanced and when\n\n<$B>  let's see\n\n uh,\n directly\n\n <unclear> two or three words </unclear>  processing  to  \n\nJohn Humpty

did, on an interim basis was,\n\neffectively  lend ,  John Humpty , three hundred thousand\n\ndollars because, and issued, in, cash\n He wanted cash\n two\n\nwords </unclear> in a position to <unclear> three or four words </unclear>\n\nand advance the cash on that   basis \n\n<$A> \n\n   Cashmore Capital Corporation    advanced that money\n\n<$B>  That's right\n\n<$A> \n\nwe understand that  Cashmore Capital Corporation  acquired that money\n\nfrom,\n\n<$B> , Two hundred and fifty thousand of that was acquired from\n\n Bling Corporation  <unclear> end of utterance </unclear>\n\n<$A> ,\n And, uh did that deal, to, that is evidenced by August\n\n eighth  uh get uh, papered if you will in terms of  \n\n<,>  a   share purchase agreement,\n\n<$B>  exactly\n deal with uh,\n\nI would

when you described the\n\nvarious  diagnoses  of uh  Homer Simpson \n\n<$A>  correct that you said\n\nthat you were relying on your own interviews with him  prior ,\n\n\n<$B>  That's correct\n\n<$A>  Was there any other material that you usually record when\n\nyou're doing your diagnostic  evaluation \n\n<$B>  social\n\nworkers' , report suggested that there was a, fear of uhm,\n\n<unclear> four

that uh from what you've told us that this was\n\nindeed the first time that you saw him it was  maybe because \n\n<unclear> rest of utterance </unclear>\n\n<$B>  That's correct\n\n<$A>  And it wasn't until the third time that you met with him that\n\nthere was this aspect of a  sort  of forensic analysis, uhm\n\nrelevant to <unclear> two words </unclear>\n\n<$B>  That's right\n\n<$A>  And so that was uh how much time did you spend with him other\n\nthan that\n\n<$B>  The interviews went an hour, half an hour and one hour only\n\n<unclear> two or three words </unclear> would have been <unclear> rest of\n\nutterance </unclear>\n\n<$A>  But I gather that just from what you've told us that it\n\ndoesn't look like you've been asked for any other historical background\n\ninformation that you've been telling us about\n\n<$B>  That's right\n\n<$A> \n\nwasn't   your evidence implying    that  \n\none of the things you did was to rule out the  like the idea of\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>, uhm with respect to the <unclear> two words\n\n</unclear>\n\n<$B>  I didn't necessarily say that I didn't rule that out\n\n<$A>  Would it have been of interest that you were making that\n\nstatement and  determination  of hypotheses <unclear> two or three\n\nwords </unclear>\n\n<$B>  thing is can I say\n\nthat uh,  you've    got to   be \n\n<unclear> two words </unclear> scientific, and I think that uh that's\n\nalways one of the ways frankly that I use   uh  to \n\n see and uh to collect information as much as possible\n\n<$A>  you might be able\n\nto tell me your own observations about  Homer Simpson  's days gone by\n\nand that you might have gotten how his history from his parents  ,  about   <unclear> word </unclear>\n word\n\n</unclear> phobia though is that with this particular phobia\n\nblood-injection-injury, uhm phobia   \n\nit   comes at a usual time\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A>  rest of\n\nutterance </unclear>\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nthis   particular phobia is uh, quite highly, familial,\n What does that mean\n\n<$B>  That means it's akin to uh, families\n At this point there's no other sheer evidence that I know of anyway\n\nthat <unclear> one or two words </unclear> families\n all phobias is\n\nthat this is highly learned behaviour,\n\n\n the mother\n is cos of increased\n\nexposure  ,  to   <unclear> three words\n\n</unclear> growing up,\n\n\nfathers as well  it depends who you're exposed to \n Phobias as a rule are learned behaviours, and can be learned\n\nfrom people like <unclear> word </unclear> who associate them with \n\nsuffering \n\n\nfatal  response is loss  ,  of   uhm blood\n\npressure, is a typical response and that is the part that <unclear> two or\n\nthree words </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nof uhm some of the family members you might have been able to place out \n\n, uhh  what   those diagnoses,\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>,\n Now how can this uh get you to tell us\n Hubbard\n\n is to just tell us    a bit more   about\n\namnesia\n\n Thank you\n\n<$B> \n\nof diagnoses that I <unclear> two or three words </unclear> and these two'll\n\nbecome evident, amnesia\n These types are all short-term\n global amnesia, general\n\namnesia and short-term amnesia\n\n<$A>  One time\n Okay\n time localized amnesia then\n\n<unclear> two or three words </unclear>\n\n<$B>  localized amnesia is\n\nthat it tends to look like <unclear> rest of utterance </unclear>\n\n<$A>  And is it correct with localized amnesia that what you find\n\n ,  is   maybe, some traumatic event has\n\noccurred like a person's been in a car accident or something like that \n\n,  and   they lose a couple of hours or even a\n\ncouple of days, around the event\n\n<$B>  Yes\n\n<$A> \n\nthought  is that\n\n<$B> \n\nthree or four words </unclear> to the person\n the\n\ntwo   aspects of memory\n\n\nrecall\n\n\n  into   uh that part of the brain where it's\n\nretained\n\n is\n\nrecall\n active,\n\nand uhh when memory is going to do a long <unclear> rest of utterance\n\n</unclear>\n\n<$A>  So uh with localized amnesia you're saying that the memory,\n\nforms but the recall is what's affected\n\n<$B>  I don't think that we know that\n\n<$B> \n\nthree or four words </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  the\n\nregistration    wasn't   <unclear> two or three\n\nwords </unclear> then you weren't able to put it into memory then basically\n\nthere wouldn't be anything to recall\n a\n\ndisturbance is <unclear> three or four words </unclear> or whatever else\n I don't think they you know\n understand\n\n<$A> \n\n saw one who suffers uh localized amnesia, that it may be the case \n\n  that   they know everything about that day that \n\n <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B>  four or\n\nfive words </unclear> of course you know\n\n<$B>  But uh, but\n\n<$A> \n\n<,>  well    how     complicated is it\n\nto get the memories back after  you, suffer     localized   amnesia\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  two or three\n\nwords </unclear>\n\n<$B>  It's very uhm, I think there, for example would be\n\n<unclear> two or three words </unclear>  hit it with , where a\n\nperson has had, uhm localized amnesia over a period of time uhm when he\n\nwas drunk\n\n\nthe trauma of an episode is over, it's gone\n\n\n<$A>  come back\n\nwithin a couple of hours\n\n<$B>  It can\n\n<$A>  that\n\nthat would be unusual  \n\n<$B>  would,\n\nyes\n\n<$A>  Uh and, now is that what we're talking about with respect\n\nto  Homer Simpson \n would it be\n\nan account of localized amnesia, by your own  standards ,\n\n<$B>  Localized amnesia as I said can take place as far as ten uhm\n\n<unclear> three or four words </unclear> and, I would say that the top \n\nlayer  indicates that the,  confusional  description in the \n\n<$A> \n\nthe ones described to you of those incidents that doesn't make sense, and\n\nis there a <unclear> three or four words </unclear>\n\n<$B>  Uhm\n\n<$A>  or the\n\n<unclear> two words </unclear>, that's unusual,\n\n<$B>  think there's\n\nanything particularly useful about that\n of amnesia could\n\ntake, you know three or four uhm up to twelve months and even his loss has\n\nbeen  external  so, it is variable\n\n<$A>  Now I gather that what you're telling us that amnesia is,\n\nis a feature of, when you're talking about <unclear> four or five words\n\n</unclear>\n\n<$B>  Okay\n\n<$A>  amnesia\n\nrelate to behaviour  ,  at that   time\n\n<$B> \n\n to picture my <unclear> two or three words </unclear>  for instance\n\n, uhm indicates a blackout an alcoholic blackout\n problem uhm with alcohol\n\nblackouts is that, the person is intoxicated, and, is not able to\n\nlay down memories\n They can still be functioning, they can still be doing some\n\nthings other people can <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\nand ,  and   absolutely no recall,  \n\n of the   event\n But their behaviour though will try to like,\n don't\n\nknow  , maybe not aware of what was happening, you know view it\n\n ,  as   <unclear> rest of utterance\n\n</unclear>\n think that the direction that\n\nthis is going    is   I think it's important for\n\nyou to see is that the specific things the <unclear> word </unclear> the\n\nagility, the panic attack the <unclear> word </unclear> attack and that is\n\nthe more important thing   <unclear> three words </unclear>  the\n\nrest of it I think is\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  but I\n\n<unclear> three or four words </unclear> answer my question of amnesia\n\n\nthe fact that someone doesn't remember what  ,  they've\n\n  done doesn't mean that they won't   <unclear> two or three\n\nwords </unclear> \n\n<$B> ,\n\n<$A>  there's\n\nno way <unclear> four or five words </unclear>\n\n<$B> ,\n\n<unclear> two or three words </unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\nthe   time\n two or three words\n\n</unclear> don't know anything about the level of functioning\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nincidents that you rely on, and I gather that , and uhm and they do describe\n\ntoo I gather uhh a  sort  of amnesia associated with that,\n\n<$B>  word\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$A> ,\n\nfrom what you had <unclear> rest of utterance </unclear>\n\n<$B>  It was uh, he,\n recall what happened\n\n<,,>\n\n<$A>  I was just referring to\n\n  your <unclear> word </unclear> of your report you said  ,  amnesia   can take hmm, a break\n a specific time point\n\nwhen <unclear> word </unclear> stops\n\n<$B>  It says the next two hours\n starts at uh\n uh\n\nthe people were uh going to be around\n\n<$A>  That wasn't something you had seen to uhm\n\n<$B>  I didn't, no,\n\n<$A>  And then uh the one other activity that you uh, rely on is\n\n<unclear> three words </unclear> where,  only one is obviously ,\n\n<$B>  the reason\n\n\ntwo or three words </unclear>  to express  amnesia\n don't recall\n up\n\nto the event, uhm, which <unclear> one or two words </unclear> a thirty\n\nto forty-five minute episode of amnesia <unclear> two or three words\n\n</unclear> from the time of the event to the time of being in the hospital\n\nafter being treated\n\n<$A>  Okay\n uh can you tell us uh\n\nDoctor  Hubbard  uhm did you inquire with him  \n\n for any more   details about this particular incident than what\n\nhe told\n\n<$B>  I didn't,\n\n<$A>  I uh\n\n<$B>  that\n\nuh\n\n<$A> \n\nhis foot up out of his boot and the skin  had been  hanging  from\n\nhis  foot\n\n<$B>  On the foot yes,\n\n<$A>  And then he put his foot back in his, boot\n Uh did you inquire about where his sock was\n\n<$B>  I didn't\n\n<$A>  Did it, strike you at the time\n\n<$A>  just\n\nmake sense to you\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Cos he told me there was skin hanging from the foot I,\n\nassumed that the sock <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$A>  I see,\n But you didn't ask him about that,\n\n\n<$B>  No, I didn't think it was necessary,\n\n<$A>  of\n\naccess to hospital records on that night,\n\n<$B>  didn't\n\n<$A>  correct is it not that\n\nwhen <unclear> three or four words </unclear> to the hospital that they\n\nwould've known about his   <unclear> two or three words </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> ,\n\n<$A>  uh\n\n<,>  the other incident was   <unclear> rest of utterance\n\n</unclear>\n\n<$B>  That's correct yeah\n\n<$A>  described\n\n a <unclear> word </unclear> amnesia three\n\n<$B>  Yes,\n\n<$A> , what\n\nkind of amnesia that is, that <unclear> two words </unclear>\n\n<$B>  Well that was the

uhm, process that with uhm all\n\nthe reasons why we would like to keep the  école\n\npremi&egrave;re  system open\n\n\n,  when the  écoles premi&egrave;res  were\n\nuhm somewhat vulnerable\n before\n if\n\n  all of that information is    going to \n\n be compiled into one document that will go to the L S B \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n you   you   remember the list that we made of all\n\nthe characteristics of the  écoles premi&egrave;res \n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B> \n\nBeakervale  and uhm I believe by  Larkley  as well\n were\n\nthere handed in that that Tuesday night when we all went to  Beakervale\n\n high school and gave, some of our ideas to the board about what we\n\nwould like to see  ,  for that and at the beginning of the race\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  That's where we're letting them know exactly what kind of\n\nschools we want to have\n That can also be included in just uh what we wanted to do at that\n\npoint was to have all the  écoles premi&egrave;res  uh\n\nand  écoles secondaire , handed in to the board to\n\nshow the board that we all want to keep this kind of school\n these characteristics\n\nto remain, and  ,  that   is something \n\n  that   is really we're not here to debate about\n We just wanted to know, that these schools that are vulnerable\n\nwhere they'll be placed\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  So that's already gone in, in this discussion but it can\n\nalso be added to, whatever we come up with about our particular school and\n\nsit in with that as well\n That would probably be a fine, idea\n\n<$A>  Okay\n Okay\n Just because I feel that uhm, uh if, one is to, uh know\n\nthe position paper   uhm  based on   uhm, \n\nthe   importance of keeping the school open, uhm one has to\n\ninclude, the, uniqueness uhm      of  uh\n\n you know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Uhm, so you didn't identify specific locations but you did\n\nidentify geographic   areas that  you felt   uhm \n\nwould   be    appropriate and  that was based on\n\n ,  trying to choose a location that was most\n\ncentral   to, the entire, uhm L S B area\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  our\n\n  location \n\n<$B>  the\n\npeople we serve  \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n what we were looking at\n\nwas something north of the  Thirty   ,  between \n\nSpruce  and  Fatima  or  excuse me  Spruce \n\nand  Churchill \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  building\n\n\n had with that we would like to    retain \n\n our name   so it  would also be helpful if we were in \n\nFatima \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  and a name\n\nit would be nice to be able to continue   with that \n\n<$A>  imagine if we were able to keep that\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  It's all part\n\n<$B>  Really when we sat down and looked at the map, it all\n\nbecame very clear that, for us for our clientele, we can't go too far\n\naway from them\n already, too far away\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm mm hmm\n\n<$B>  for\n\nchanging  it closer\n\n<$A>  location\n\nthat  Bayside  serves\n Do you know\n\n<$B> \n\n  I believe it's   from   really around\n\nour  school   boundary  ,  over towards, the \n\nMissiongate  area\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<,> towards   that area\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  I don't know the exact location, but uhm on the map, uhm\n\n Elizabeth  will be able  ,  to   show you\n But it's really, from our school over\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n they\n\n  they   share\n,\n\n L S B students\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n    to   go   from let's say the \n\nMissiongate  area, to somewhere in between  Spruce  and \n\nAberman \n Would it not\n\n<$B>  That would be the farthest that people would have to go I\n\nbelieve\n\n\n actually would   be somewhat in the area of our school\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  You know\n\n<$B>  A little\n\nfarther   away from that\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  they're looking at an\n\nL S B school, uhm,    and   they're not\n\ngoing to rent the facilities\n We looked at the map and what was available\n\n\nby bus    it's not     that far\n\n\n just  down    Fatima  boulevard\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  It's a straight straight route not too bad, but uhm,\n\nthere isn't too much else  , otherwise \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mm hmm mm hmm\n\n<$B>  Uhm so I don't know if that's going to happen\n of the\n\n  two schools but uh    if   that is the\n\ncase it would, bring our population up to the point where we would need a\n\nfairly large school  ,  to   handle our\n\n<$A> \n\nwould that   would  \n how much\n\nadditional clientele one would get, by moving our school to a more central\n\nlocation\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  And we wouldn't know for a couple years would we because uhm\n\n<,> we'd have to settle and let the community get to know us and  ,\n\n find out if there's a market for our kind of school\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  the public if all the schools are\n\nabominable then    we have to wait \n\n for the dust to settle everywhere because  ,  all\n\n  these changes will take place and   then,  you'll\n\nhave to get used to it's like moving into a new community almost and learning\n\n<,> which schools  , uhm  belong   to which\n\nschool board     and  \n\nthe locations in all of the schools so it would almost feel you're like\n\nmoving into a new   community \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  yes\n\n<$B> \n, there are complicating\n\nfactors too in that the L S B may move into early immersion\n possible\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  well then that's uh competition\n\nfor the type of school that we have,\n\n<$B> \n\nécole premi&egrave;re  because I think it's a different\n\nexperience and I think that she'll have more the type of experience  ,  that   he was mentioning\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  You know\n\n<$A>  That's right\n\n<$B>  the closer\n\nyou can get to that without, the child, becoming, stressed, which\n\n   I   don't see    any  \n\nproblem with that so far with my daughter\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  Uhm, the better\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  when\n\nyou're   sending your child into school you might say well,\n\nthey've got, early immersion so that's what I'll go for\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  so it's\n\n  so that'll   be a factor if that comes in in the next few\n\nyears and I had a feeling, don't have anything to base it on at all,\n\nbut it's just, gut and, I think that people are   \n\ngoing to   be moving towards early immersion in the L S B\n\n<$A>  it looks like it's\n\n  a growing trend   uh  in the   P S B G\n\nM system\n uhm in fact there are a lot\n\nof schools that are, bilingual schools      and\n\n   many children choose to go to either the English classes or\n\nthe French classes but there are bilingual schools  ,  within\n\nthe P S B G M\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  So you're seeing this more and more\n cheating\n\nway of getting around the bilingual program  ,  uhm because uhm\n\nas was    suggested         you're\n\n  learning   an academic language as opposed to learning a\n\nfunctional language\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Right right\n\n<$A>  And uh that's really unfortunate you know because uhm, uh\n\n   you  , grew up in Ontario I think \n\n right \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  So you've had the same experience I had where I learned a\n\nvery academic French in school and went out into my community which was a\n\nFrench   community  and tried to apply   what  I\n\nhad learned in school and was laughed at there\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Uh it was very frustrating and uh so what I literally did was\n\nI just entrenched myself, in my social life    in \n\n French uhm to pick up the real French or what I considered to be the\n\nreal French there the functional French\n\n<$A> \n\nwhen  uh  when   I was being tested   uh     for   language uhm, in school\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  when\n\n  it came time for examinations we had to, uh write on index cards\n\n<,> three topics uh that we would like to talk about\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A> \n\n uhm, uh  in   the area, I had all the\n\nterminology down pat    in French \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n was somewhat of a unique topic  ,  and that by the time\n\nI got in to meet the evaluator he may have already spoken to other students\n\nfifteen or twenty times on    subjects   such as\n\nhockey or uhm, baseball uhm or perhaps uhm dance    or\n\n  piano lessons or   something like that,  with other\n\nchildren\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<,>  with that particular topic\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n  to   discuss \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  gonna\n\n  going to   work\n\n<$A>  And the other two topics that I picked were usually rather\n\nuninteresting bland   topics  so then I knew that the  \n\nequestrian  one would  be really likely \n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n had the    I had   uhm  the   \n\n ease    and the   uh comfort zone to be\n\nable to pull it off  with this terminology and so I always got\n\nreally good   grades, in  oral communication   skills\n\nin a second  language\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  So hopefully our children will be quite\n\nso ingenious  ,    and   be able  to\n\n<$B>  on the\n\nstreet, there's a   there are a couple of girls up the street \n\n  Faye   Tina   Jennifer  and, what is really\n\nwonderful is that, the doors are opened for  Martha  whereas some\n\nother kids, they can only play   uh\n\n with the English   kids\n\n<$B> \n\nthey   they   feel comfortable with\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  the language is a real barrier once you\n\nget up to the age where our kids are around eight  ,  years\n\nold    and   so,  Martha     can  , play with the English kids\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  She can play with the French\n\n\nbut   but   it really, opens up the world for her to be\n\nable to go    and   play with these kids as well\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  so, some of the things\n\nthat uh  Marmaduke  was talking about  ,  about\n\n  applying it after school, uhm become a little less forced\n\nbecause you just begin at an early age to make friends, that are speaking\n\nthat other language\n\n<$B>  today\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  wanted to go up and he wants so badly to\n\nplay with little  Julien    and  Jean-Jaques   and\n\n Paul-Henri  and  Pierre-Louis     and \n\n  Sebastien  all the little boys\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Up the top of the street is French\n Down the bottom of the street is English\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  up and play with these\n\nlittle guys\n\n<$B> \n\n   I    want to     speak\n\nFrench\n communicate\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  the same\n\nthing will happen with him that the incentive will be there, and that\n\nhe'll be able to go out and practice his craft  , on the street \n\nand learn, those everyday, things\n\n<$A>", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '966a3b0f-8d93-4a25-a6a0-3ede46b97f1f', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:50.779259+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9761416912078857,

\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  how\n\nmany   children in our school population have special needs and\n\nshould we be, identifying that in this particular letter\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  No\n\n<$B> , I don't know, and that's a good point\n\n<$B> \n\na   specific need is just five, and that's not a lot of the\n\npopulation\n I don't know if there are other specific needs that are being\n\naddressed\n I've\n\n  I've      seen   kids with\n\ndifferent needs\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  But uhm, yes that's a good point,\n That's a good point\n this\n\nwas   this was   uhm , some of the old drafts\n I'm not even sure if I may have even taken that off so you'll see\n\n   in   whatever that comes out whether that's on\n\n<$B> , it's a good point to bring up\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mm hmm mm hmm\n\n<$B> \n Notification the last

the actual closure\n\nwould take place, and at the same time that closure is notified we also\n\nwant to know, which building we are being moved to\n And that the reason for this is that we want to, give this\n\ninformation to our population and prepare everyone for their relocation\n\nwithout uhm, oh I don't know\n\n<$A>  To ensure for a smooth transition\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  Yeah\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  also I added something\n\nabout uh this'll make sure that    our E P P \n\n parents, uh feel secure about the situation and part of the process\n That type of

this\n\ntype of situation with the board and we look forward to working with them,\n\non it\n to\n\n  go halfway on this\n We just\n\n<$A> \n\n,  however give us our  needed  time      and    you know

winners if it comes out that way\n\nhuh\n\n<$A>  Yeah,\n\n<$A>  came\n\nup as you were talking about the advance notice\n\n<$A>  in that\n\n the daycare that uhm,  Kathy  went to as a young child, uhm\n\n<,> relocated, uh    and      it was a really  , tough, decision actually\n\nbecause the daycare, had only been in existence, for about two years\n\n<,> when, the building was slated for demolition\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Oh my\n\n<$A> \n\n all a little saddened by it and yet we all saw it as a positive move \n\n because , the location that we were now being offered was bigger\n\nand better\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Hmm\n\n<$A>  Uh bigger uhm, in the sense of spacewise uh and also uhm\n\noutside the building   uh  the   playground area\n\nwas much much bigger, so there were a lot of really, great plusses to\n\nit\n\n<$A>  Uhm, better in the sense that uhm, we felt uhm, it\n\nwas a more homey kind of atmosphere that   we were going  to be\n\nmoving to  , although  it was uhm,    a\n\n  duplex, uh that had been renovated\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  The other duplexes, in the area were all University\n\nbuildings\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  And so there was a degree of, not commercialism but I\n\nguess institutionalism  , uhm  on the street   you\n\nknow \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Uhm and it was a very short little space, so uhm, it\n\ndidn't have that homey feeling\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  And then we went up against opposition of uhm our local\n\nresidents of our new building, who did not want the daycare to be situated\n\non their street\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  In My Backyard syndrome, and uh\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> ,\n\n<$B>  just find it surprising\n\nthat people    are   as uh, contrary to\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>    this   whole idea\n\n<$B>  It's hard\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  We just hear on the news now about what's going on about the\n\ndaycare\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  Yeah there's one right now that uh I think one of the\n\nCanadian uh, government officials wrote a letter on uh, government\n\nstationary   <unclear> word </unclear> uhm \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  residents thought we\n\nwere    going to   be ripping up and down the\n\nstreets with our cars dropping   our children off  at all hours and\n\n<,> you know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nwe've really blended    into the  \n\ncommunity  quite nicely   uhm,  and   \n\n  we've   had some interesting uh, uh\n\nget-togethers with the community and invited them to come and visit and we\n\nhad an open house and they could come in and, tour the  \n\nfacilities and what not \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  and\n\n  and   that might be something that we have to look  \n\nat\n\n<$A> And  also uhm\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  That's a good idea\n\n<$A>  look at\n\nit from the community's   perspective \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And we tried to look at it from the children's perspective\n\n<$A>  And then so well in advance we explained to the children that\n\nthe building was going to be, taken down, uhm but it was for a positive\n\nstep because they were going to be building a new high school and it was\n\nreally important for, the boys of this particular school to have the space\n\nthat they needed\n And, so we tried to encourage them to understand, uhm the\n\nprocess a little bit more\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  the building\n\nbeing   torn down, if, it came to that, that none of them\n\nwould be frightened\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  And so we had to prepare the children, and we had to\n\nprepare the community that we were moving into and we had to prepare the\n\nparents, of the children    whose lives\n\nwere also   being affected by   all of this \n\n<$B>  the community\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  let them know to take away some of\n\nthat, anxiety that they had\n\n<$A> \n\nthe   most uhm, difficult thing to do actually was to have a\n\nmeeting with the community\n We invited, uhm everyone on the street, to come, and uh\n\nmeet with us\n And it was a somewhat antagonistic uh, meeting\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A> \n\nuh padded agendas   and  lists of complaints and, ideas\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And, what we did was that we, basically just tried to\n\nhandle the questions one on one, uhm, gently, uh and    with uh a   , strong degree of tact  \n\n   and   \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  we tried\n\nto   impress upon them that we were of a cooperative nature and so if\n\nthere was something that, they were really opposed to that we didn't feel\n\nwas something absolutely necessary then we, were  going to\n\naccommodate them\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  Uhm so, what we did was, they were very concerned about\n\nus driving up and down the street so we agreed that we would not use the\n\nfront doors, of the building\n\n<$A>  And we designed the building so that people would have to\n\ncome through the campus, and park on the campus, parking   lot\n\nfacilities, and come  in through the back door, to eliminate  the additional stress on the street   that they thought \n\nthat they were going to have\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '0c359557-9d86-446f-a7cb-747d5f01941f', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:50.780617+00:00', 'english_score':

put your children there\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n experience that we came across was uhm, a child who was longing \n\n  to   come and play in the playground\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  and so what we did do was we suggested to the\n\nparent that uh, during the daytime when the other children were outside\n\n<,> as long as the child was healthy, uhm  , \n\nthey could   come    and  , play and\n\nparticipate but the parent would have to observe the child and   make\n\nsure that,  they weren't getting into fights   and things\n\nlike that \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  welcomed her into the\n\ncommunity but, we did have to lock the gates in the evening because for\n\nuhm insurance purposes, and security purposes we couldn't leave it open\n\n<$B>  Sure\n\n<$A>  So, uhm I think that those kinds of issues help them to\n\n<,> settle into us and us to them uh\n\n<$B> \n\nsaying   well  what can   I do in this process\n\n<,> in being sensitive to the needs of all the people involved\n\n\nthe ,  the   teachers are going to \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  And the administration as well, and, our committees,\n\nand the population as a whole the students the board,\n They all have a, slightly different, perspective on this\n Our commissioners\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B> \n\n it's   different because some are parents  V P P  and \n\n,  some   are not\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  trying to, make\n\nthis a,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  about that you know uh taking away\n\n<,> the anxiety    at   different times from\n\ndifferent groups    and  , making people feel\n\n<,,> secure that    their   voice will be heard\n\nand, taken into account\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  afraid\n\n<$B> \n\nthere's a   there's a   hidden agenda and everybody's    going to   be pushed to the side in, whatever group\n\nthey're not in   you know \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Well there was one person who lived on the street who\n\ncampaigned very hard uhm  , uh  with the\n\nuhm, city   of, uhm sorry I don't know  whether  it was\n\n Toronto  west or  a  if it was  G N A  cos it's right\n\non the   border so \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  there\n\n  was   there was   a lot of discussion as to whether\n\nor not this uhm, particular uhm daycare was actually going to, take \n\nplace  there\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  campaigned\n\nquite hard and she got quite a few of the, neighbours, riled    and  , ready to go to battle   over this\n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n you meet people face to face, even if that first, encounter isn't\n\nas pleasant as one would hope it would be, we're all human, and we all\n\nreally want the same things which is    space \n\n and peace and tranquility and, clean air and, all the things that\n\nthey wanted were the things that we   wanted \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And so, uh we, uh I guess, just, by uhm,\n\npresenting ourselves uhm, and almost using the opportunity to push\n\nourselves on them, made them realize that we weren't the big monster the\n\nbig ogre    that   uhm  unknown entity\n\n<,> that they thought\n And so, my feeling is that, we should be addressing in this\n\nletter  ,  the need, for us to, uhm, be able to\n\nidentify with these different groups as early as possible, so that we can\n\nmake people feel comfortable about the move    and \n\n so that the community that we eventually   \n\nrelocate   to  ,  feels comfortable about the fact\n\nthat we are now going to   be in their <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  So that would be a logical, extension of this point\n\n<$A>  Mm hm mm hmm\n\n<$A>  address too\n\nbecause  I think it makes people realize,    the\n\n  need for advance notice and to be part of the   process\n\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  That's all we're asking for is, enough, time so that we\n\ncan, adjust and the people around us, will adjust  \n\n and      that's   time    there's   a healing process that has to happen\n\n<$A>  You have to have closure and you have to have, an open\n\nhouse   perhaps whereby  people in the community   \n\n  can come   \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  idea\n\n<$B>  An open house so people can, picture themselves in this\n\nenvironment\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm, mm hmm\n\n<$A> \n\n,  organized  ,  where events can be planned uhm\n\n   and   we can try    and \n\n, take into consideration the anxieties of, the children and the\n\nparents    and the   community that\n\nwe're, moving into, as well as some of the concerns that the \n\nLeedsman  school board may have\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  the letter, I would also\n\n   that   very point  ,  if\n\n  it sufficiently, states that we want to work with the board on\n\nthis process if it's sufficiently, accommodating to their, position\n\nbecause they're in a difficult spot\n, It's hard financially to come up with the money they have to\n, So, I want the tenor of the, letter to carry that\n\n<$A>  so what we're saying then\n\nis we want   to make sure that we have advance notice in order for us\n\nto form a relocation committee so that we can work with, the teachers\n\nadministration committee members parents, students, uh the school board\n\nand the community   uhm \n\n<$B>  the community that's right\n\n<$A>  to do it, within budget\n\n<$B> , Mm hmm\n\n<$A> \n\nit's done well, I think that we can integrate    and\n\n  perhaps even, draw, more, students  \n\n from the  , direct community    that \n\n we   relocate to \n\n<$B>  I agree I agree\n\n<$B>  point, uhm, was\n\nvery well taken, that   uhm,  we're   so\n\nfar from the people we serve, that other    possible\n\nclientele  , many of them don't even consider us because we're not\n\npart of their lives\n\n\nthey never see it\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  They never think of it as an opportunity and it's frightening\n\nto send your, tiny child all that way\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B> \n\nmore in the midst of a community, seen as a, option\n Yeah\n\n<$A>  the\n\nsecond segment then     ,\n\n   a      further extension of your letter\n\n<,> by talking about you know the importance of advance notice,\n\nspecifically    for this purpose  \n\n  relocation  purpose\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> , that might help\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  if I can get\n\nit   to you before the committee  ,  and\n\nhave   copies made so that we can pass them out to people, people\n\ncan read it at   the committee and  comment on it  ,\n\n at the same time as they're commenting on   yours \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  isn't\n\nit \n\n<$B>  and then we can sandwich it,\n\n<$B>  like you to do is when\n\nyou get this letter, uh if there's a way, that, this can be,\n\nsandwiched in   do you know what I mean \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  may mean for example\n\n<,> rewriting, point six\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  Okay\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n the   whole way the letter is done and   \n\n if   it     says it better then, that's\n\nthe way we should do it\n\n<$B>  if people\n\ncan   look at this, and say, okay, I think  \n\n that   this needs to be added in, and take what you've done\n\nand, sort of \n would like for them that night to\n\nwalk away having a good picture of what they're, voting on\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  So if there's something that, is a logical insertion we\n\nmove this up we move this down, and   this goes  in here\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B>  That would really be helpful so that they, don't go away\n The only concern I had that was so important, that they don't\n\ngo away thinking that we're going to, continue to develop this afterward\n I'd like them to get a good feeling\n, Do you know what I mean\n\n<$B>  some small tinkering\n\nbut a good feeling like this is what they're voting on is what's going \n\n out, and  for you to come tonight and get, these ideas ready is\n\nperfect\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  So if you have that ready and copied and this letter is ready\n\nand copied and any other ideas that come in, uhm,  that's\n\nwhy I want to get them before the meeting, so that they're down\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  we'll be able to compose this, in a\n\nfinal form pretty well, at the meeting and vote on it   because \n\nwe need the vote of the school committee  ,  to  \n\nsend it in\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Yeah, I guess that's probably the best way to handle it is\n\n  uhm,  to   do it that way, cos\n\nthere's very little time left before the end of the   school year \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  I'm just wondering if uhm, let's assume that I get this\n\ntomorrow, and if I did have time to write   something  up\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  Would you want me to distribute it ahead of time, so that\n\npeople have a chance to, look at it and, see the changes, or do you\n\nthink that would confuse people\n\n<$B> , Let's see\n\n<$A>  Of course it depends on how much I write and I won't know how\n\nmuch I write until I sit down and do it\n\n<$B>  Yeah, you know the school\n Are you going to be home tomorrow\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  uhm\n\n<$A>  I'm home on the weekend though\n\n<$B> \n\nthat  Cher's  going to be in tomorrow  ,  and I'm sure\n\nshe's going to be working on this\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  I'm almost positive\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  me a copy\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  That would be great\n There you go\n And we can take a look at it and see\n\n\nsome   things    you'd   like to see uhm\n\n<,>  sentences  we were doing    or   some\n\nthings like minor things that you'd like to see\n a couple\n\nsentences   you    want to   put in\n In that case then, uhm, I think that can be done, at the\n\nmeeting\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  think\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n could be   done \n\n<$A>  minor things yeah\n\n<$A>  There's things I'm not, as worried about, uh the\n\nnuances and things    we can  \n\nplay with at the meeting and I think  ,  people\n\nwill     appreciate, being part of that\n\nprocess\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  now,\n\nwhether people have it prior to the meeting\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  My feeling is that I think that, I can't imagine anybody\n\nnot agreeing with us\n I think that's such a super point\n\n<$B>  So, I guess we can't lose by sending it to people before\n\nthe meeting  ,  but I think that if we do it at the meeting\n\n, they're going to uh redo it   as well \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  mm hmm\n\n<$B>  logical\n\n<,>    uh  \n\n<$A>  that if you give them so much\n\ninformation  , sometimes  people don't actually read the\n\nwhole thing before    other people   start\n\ncommenting  , and  then, uhm, you may be commenting\n\nwithout having read the whole thing    and   \n\n  not   feeling comfortable with it   so,\n\n it really depends on the length, of what I do\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n,  then I would like to be able   uhm,  to\n\n  have people have a look at it  ,  even if it's only      the \n\n night before\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  Uhm, you know it's just so that they have an idea as to\n\nwhat my proposed changes to the letter   would be,  so that\n\nthey're not hit off guard with it  , you know

need\n\n\nconsider , have you been skiing for a long time\n\n<$A>  Uhm, I've been skiing,\n don't\n\nknow      well since   I was a teenager\n\nso like eleven ten years I guess\n\n<$B>  level do you

<unclear> one or two words </unclear> but\n\n<$B>  And, how much do you weigh\n\n<$A> , Weigh\n\n About a hundred and twenty\n\n<$B>  A hundred and twenty okay,\n I ask\n\npeople    how much   they weigh  ,\n\nis  we need to accomodate we need to be able to find the skier some \n\nsuitable skis for  the knees of the skier\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Why\n\n<$B>  length as well as weight\n\nbecause one thing that's  important  when you're looking  ,  for a good ski   is uh, you need your weight\n\nto be evenly distributed throughout the ski\n because what happens is\n\nyou're not using the tip of your ski, and then with that you lose a lot of\n\ngrip on the ice and    you're not\n\n  getting enough of the ski\n than\n\nusing maximum leverage on the ski and you gain more control\n\n<$A> , wait a second I don't understand,\n put the\n\n  put\n right place\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n\n\nJerry's   a   good skier, right\n your height and weight\n If you have somebody that's uh, two hundred and twelve odd\n\npounds for example you    want to   put them on a\n\nski that's    a hundred   and seventy-seven\n\ncentimetres in length  ,\n ideally, we want the weight to be evenly\n\ndistributed around the ski\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  The reason for this, is what happens if the weight is too\n\nconcentrated in the centre the person weighs too much, for the ski the ski\n\nis not long enough, what'll happen, is that the person is not able the\n\nski  does  not functioning, to that person's ability\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> cos    there's not enough   weight distributed\n\nthroughout the ski\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  when\n\npeople are  on ice, the ski will lose its grip\n\n<$A>  the\n\nwhole point, of having different length skis  , is \n\n<$B> , Right\n varies according to your height and to your\n\nweight\n\n<$A>  And your weight\n Okay so it's both combined\n Cos yeah I always knew the height but I didn't know the weight\n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$A>  gonna\n\n  going to   ask me how tall I am or,\n\n<$B>  Well uh actually I can see how tall you are\n\n\n<$A>  how tall am I\n\n<$B> \n Well you see that's the thing is that's why it's usually good to\n\nhave a ski  right there so I  can line it up <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n body \n For a beginner skier we usually go head height,\n The intermediate skier you usually want between five and fifteen\n\ncentimetres over your head\n to five inches\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  then,\n\nbasically advanced or expert skier you should uhm, <unclear> word\n\n</unclear>  you give    them   some  advice\n\n   \n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B>  skier knows how long a ski they\n\nneed by their own ability and,    how they can\n\n  <unclear> word </unclear> their turns and they know, whether a\n\nski is too long for them or not\n control it, then it's not a\n\nproblem to them\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> , you know\n\n<$B> \n\n a problem that usually happens when people,\n the parents\n\n  are always concerned about the length of the skis so sometimes they\n\nwant it to be bigger and longer  , <unclear> word </unclear> \n\nyou know when they're growing\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> , They can keep the ski for a few years\n\n<$A>  Oh yeah\n\n<$B>  speaker has short

was saying basically uh,\n What the hell was I saying,\n\n<$A>  You were talking about the length of the ski\n\n You were talking about kids\n\n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$B> \n\nthe parents will want a longer ski so they don't have to, buy them the\n\nnext year,\n\n<$A>  Oh really\n\n<$B>  Ya\n sometimes happens\n\nbut the thing is is really, the safety    of  \n\nthe skier is the first and foremost important thing to worry about\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  important to go\n\nfor the sale\n for\n\n  the important thing   ,  to  \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n do is you    want to   suit the skier,\n\nfor their needs\n find them the\n\nright equipment so that, what they're getting is uh,   uh  something that's    going to      like , suit their\n\nneeds as a skier and not uh\n\n Cos it's no fun it's like, if

skier's\n\nneeds\n give them the\n\nbest possible product for their needs\n\n<$A>  Okay,\n\n<$B>  Uhm, do you need ski boots\n we're suiting up a\n\n  we're outfitting ah a   customer or a skier, it's usually\n\nbest to start with the boots because that's usually what takes the longest\n\namount of time\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n<$A>  Well I'll take a look at the boots, but uh, the truth\n\nis I already have a pair\n\n<$B>  You already have a pair\n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$B> , Alright, uhm,\n Alright\n\n<$A>  wouldn't mind just\n\nlooking at the boots just to see what you have available just <unclear> one\n\nor two words </unclear>   like  it, so\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n upgrade, \n\n<$B> \n Uhm, uhm\n\n<$A>  Are these all second-hand or\n\n<$B>  No these are all new boots\n\n<$A>  Okay these are all new\n\n<$B>  Ya,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> , basically in terms of price they\n\nrange around from ninety-nine dollars uh <unclear> word </unclear> down\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>    but  \n\n\nsist    sixty-three   dollars for a junior ski boot,\n\nright up to, let's see here <unclear> two or three words </unclear> but uh\n\n<,> uh around two hundred dollars  depending \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  so yeah some of these prices have\n\nbeen marked down from uh about two seventy-five\n\n<$B>  you know\n\nquite, quite uhm you know uh\n\n<$A>  Significant\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n<$A>  come you guys have such\n\n<,> you know, good prices\n good deal\n\n<$B>  So what we do is we're liquidating all of our own equipment\n\nand all  the old  equipment   uh  for  \n\nsomebody else and uh\n So it's worked out we get to make a profit off some of that money\n\n<$A>  You mean for some companies that haven't sold their equipment\n\nyou're liquidating for them\n\n<$B>  Exactly\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  three or four\n\nwords </unclear>  Thomas  we liquidate his equipment and as we said we\n\nmake some of the money, off him and he makes some of the money off us \n\n so \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  a good balance\n Yeah it's a good\n there are things that it helps uh,\n helps uh it helps us get\n\n you know,  it helps us to    raise  \n\nmoney more   so that we can compete on the circuit,\n\n<$A>  I see\n So, basically you're making money for your ski team you get a\n\n nice  big deal and you're liquidating their   stock  so\n\neverybody's,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\nbenefits from  that \n\n<$A>  Okay\n So what's the difference between these boots like uh, I mean\n\nbesides the price\n\n<$B> ,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Uhm\n\n<$A>  Cos are these ones like one thirty these ones're two thirty\n\nso it's something\n these two\n\nwhat's the difference between them\n\n<$B>  there's\n\n  there's   a little bit of a difference in the sense that\n\nthis one was ah, actually a woman's boot and this one's a men's boot\n,\n of\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  do men\n\nand women need different  , boots \n\n<$B>  generally the thing is is that uh most\n\nof men's feet are a little bit <unclear> word </unclear> shaped a bit\n\ndifferently than women's feet to be a bit, wider, and uh to be a bit\n\nlonger, as well\n men\n\nusually weigh, a bit more, than women and therefore they need a little\n\nbit, stiffer boot\n But ah each boot varies according to the ability of the skier\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  For example, this one here's a beginner boot\n\n<$A> \n\nmakes it <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B>  it a beginner boot\n\n<$B>  different\n\n boot, is you're looking at uh, not so much  career  but \n\n uh  you're looking more in terms  \n\nof uh the flex of the boot, uhm the stiffness of the boot rigidity,\n\nwhat kind of support it offers, and whether it flexes a lot or they don't\n\n<,>\n you have a beginner skier it's\n\nreally important that they're able to bend their knees and to, apply\n\npressure to the skis in order to complete the turn\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B> \n\nwhat happens is  if you put a beginner skier, in an advanced boot,\n\n what happens is   the boot's so stiff, is that they're \n\n    going to   have a lot of problems turning\n\nthe ski because they're not able to transfer pressure from the foot, onto\n\nthe ski\n Therefore, and vice versa with an advanced skier, if you\n\nhave somebody  who  're very heavy or very strong,  then that\n\nweight  is    going to   crush the boot and\n\nthe boot will not control according   to the weight \n\n<$A>  gonna\n\n  going to   crush the boot  or  because\n\n<$B>  word\n\n</unclear> the ski  it varies  right\n really depends\n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B> \n\n<,>  like   a   more advanced skier, you have someone\n\nwho's a more advanced skier they tend to be a little bit more aggressive uhm\n that we ask or we\n\nasked a skier    before   outfitting them\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  we\n\nask so many questions sometimes, people can become offended when we're\n\nasking,\n why\n\nare you asking so many   questions\n\n\n you can best you know    outfit\n\n  the needs of the skier to the best support <unclear> word\n\n</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B>  To their needs\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  That's why we ask so many questions\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  But uhm\n\n<$A>  So this one's a beginner boot so that probably wouldn't be\n\ngood for me,\n\n<$B>  Uhm, no\n if you\n\nhave an advanced if you have a   if you have a beginner skier \n\n, who weighs you know, three hundred and eighty pounds if you have\n\n  you know, ah,  a   pleasantly plump,\n\ncustomer      you know who\n\nwould like to   ski,  \n\n<,>  chances are, that uh      his\n\n  weight,   , he'll need \n\n a bit of a stiffer boot because he weighs a lot more and therefore he\n\nneeds the support\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n take a more advanced boot not because he's a\n\ngood skier but because he's, big\n\n<$B>  Right\n Totally\n gonna\n\n  going to   sell him the top of the line boot because the\n\nthing is he's not    going to   use that  \n\nbut  at the same time you    want to   get\n\nsomething", 'subdomain':

like I'm trying\n you know\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  So\n\n<$B>  So, it seems to me as though you're looking for something\n\nthat's a pretty quick turning ski something snappy  ,  something\n\nthat's easily moveable\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Therefore when you're looking for something like that you're\n\nlooking for something    uh, that's   soft on\n\nthe shovel\n\n<$B>  Okay that's the front of the ski at the top\n Okay\n\n<$A>  Okay\n Ya\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  way what happens is it's easy to\n\ninitiate  in  turn\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B> \n And then what you want is something that's a little bit uh stiffer\n\n   in the   tail  , okay  in the\n\nback of the ski\n\n\nthat way   you know that way   what happens is it whips you\n\nout of your turns and it prepares you for your next turn\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  word\n\n</unclear> ski you're going to look for,  \n\n ah, for a skier who's   looking    to do   short radius turns\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  the reason for that is just that uh you know\n\nit's easy to begin the turn it's easy to come out of it and  prepare the\n\n <unclear> word </unclear>\n, a\n\nlot for   a G S ski which also means giant slalom, they're making\n\nbigger turns, generally they have   \n\n   more   of an even   flex to the skier\n\n an equal flex and what that\n\ndoes is when they're connecting their turns, they just go long and\n\nsmoothly\n\n\n  about the changing of their weight  \n\nso much\n\n<$A>  Okay,\n\n<$B> \n\nit's     quite something\n\n It's a great ski\n It's super light\n too you're looking for something that's\n\n torsionally stiff \n Okay\n is quite\n\n  it's quite    torsional \n basically\n\n  \n\n<$A> \n What's the word\n\n<$B>  Torsion\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n One ski is torsionally\n adding an\n\nA L L Y to the end of the words\n that torsionally is stiff\n basically regulates\n\nthe amount of torque that you have in a ski,   \n\nhow much it   rotates when you're carving your turn\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B> \n\nthat's ah stiffer torsionally    ,  means it's    going to   hold better on ice\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\nbetween     that's one of the differences that you look at\n\nbetween   like a beginner's ski and an advanced ski\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n they generally tend to be   more  stiffer torsional \n\nbecause they're applying more pressure on their ski   and    they're   using more of their leg and so what's\n\nhappening is they need something that's    going to \n\n be strong and that's going to be holding up to the pressure and    you know the weight   that they put on their ski\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  Okay\n hold\n\nbetter\n\n\n one of the <unclear> word </unclear> you know not as stiff torsionally\n\ngenerally what tends to happen is that    uh the  \n\nski does not hold as well on ice\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  And when you have a beginner's ski because they're not\n when\n\nthey   make their turns is    as\n\nthey're turning      uhm, they're not\n\n  putting as much pressure on, they're not using the ski as much\n That's generally what happens\n as their\n\n  skiing improves   you know     the\n\nskier   will make the turn from the tip of the ski all the way to the\n\nend\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  opposed to\n\nusing it more, as opposed to pivoting the ski more\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B> \n\n tend to   pivot their ski\n\n<$A>  moving\n\nyour foot instead of the whole ski    kind of  \n\n<$B>  Exactly\n\n\n that's generally   what happens sometimes    when you have   ah a beginner skier\n something\n\n , something      uh to  \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> a little more\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  the entire ski\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B>  word\n\n</unclear> so it's going to hold pretty well on the ice\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  ski\n\n You know it's good for doing short radius turns\n pretty stable at\n\nhigh speeds    as far as   you    want\n\nto   look for,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  chatter\n\n\n when\n\nyou're   skiing is you go faster sometimes what happens    if there's   not enough weight in front of\n\nthe ski, we tend to find the skier move from left to right\n\n\n like   \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Ya exactly\n chatter\n\n<$A>  I had skis that did that\n When I'd get going really fast it'd be like ah ah ah ah like that\n\n  like I'd  be shaking\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n  are   constructed\n That's something that you're going to have to look for\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$B>  it doesn't\n\n    have shock absorbers\n actually does shock absorb\n So I guess what they call the V A S it's vibration absorption\n\nsystem  , whereas  this one  does not  have it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$B> \n\n minute \n\n<$A>  Sure\n\n<$B>  a few words\n\n</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Sorry\n\n<$A>  It's okay,\n\n look fine\n\nor whatever   and they  sound good but uh, I just find them a\n\nbit expensive\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  You know it's like I don't,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  only\n\nthe ski one ninety-five and then  you've got the binding too ,\n\n<$B>  Right the thing is right, you can either spend\n\n\ngive you a ski for a hundred bucks, and a binding for a hundred bucks but\n\nyou know what, you're    going to   finish the\n\nski\n lose its life\n\nin about uh a year or two years\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  great at first cos it's a new\n\nski but what happens is because it will be receiving so much abuse,\n\nthey're not designed that way they're not   made  to <unclear> word\n\n</unclear>, so\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Right,\n What about this section over here\n Is there anything there that\n\n<$B> \n\n expensive\n\n\n<$A>  it's okay\n If they're more expensive, I don't know,\n you're\n\n   going to   be getting in second-hand are they\n\nall here   already \n\n<$B>  here already\n\n<$A>  Oh\n\n<$B>  Ya,\n deadline for bringing\n\nstuff in was Tuesday however

take a look here,\n No uh\n\n\n<$A>  Three one eight four you said and it's regularly two nineteen\n\n<$B>  Uhh two nineteen ninety-five, and right now it's selling\n\nfor one sixty-nine ninety-five\n\n<$A>  that's a good price\n\n<$B>  That's not bad,\n good price,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  It's all right,\n\n<$A>  I like it,\n But do you think uh\n\n\n<$B>  lot of jackets,\n\n<$A> ,\n want a coat but I need a\n\n   jacket   that I can wear like to work you know\n\n<$B>  Right\n\n<$A>  I don't think\n\n Could I wear that to work,\n\n<$B>  two words\n\n</unclear>\n\n<$A>

\n\nword </unclear>\n\n<$B>  a really good ski actually\n\n<$A>  Ya but they're old\n I mean they were like at least\n, so\n\n they're probably like at least fifteen years old\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  And, I

chaired and we were talking\n\nabout protocol and  fonction d\'équipe  and stuff\n us\n\nhe says that   , since   our last meeting it\'s\n\nbeen going very well, you know between the two offices\n\n<$B>  That\'s nice he had something, positive to say\n\n<$A>  Ya\n And then uhm, but he said you know there\'s still a lack of\n\ncommunication between you know  Tori  and I, so that we have to\n\nwork on\n So we talked about like any problems and stuff\n\n<$A>  brought up the fact that, when we\n\nsat down, that Friday, to talk about the  ,  dossier \n\n    how interesting   it was\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  It was\n\n<$A>  Ya\n And I said you know\n So I mentioned that the whole problem that we don\'t have time to\n\nevaluate cos we\'re always running\n And I said and some of that has come from the fact that we don\'t\n\nhave a lot of overtime accumulated anymore\n\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\npush a    sixty\n\n  hour work week which we used to work sixty hours and  ,\n\naccumulate  all that time in thirty-five hours, so obviously a lot of\n\nour time is now spent out of the office running around,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  So he wrote all these things down\n And, so we started talking about December\n realize\n\n    he didn\'t know   that we were  \n\n going to   take December to evaluate, which\n\n<$B>  Which we mentioned a few months ago\n\n<$A>  Ya\n We\'ve mentioned quite a few times\n So\n\n<$B>  What do you think about that,\n\n<$A>  He likes it\n He really likes it\n He thinks it might not be\n Well uh first he said two weeks is too much and we said are you\n\nkidding\n Like uh we think that that\'s going to be\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  down and do it we did it just\n\nfor  dossier femme ,   and \n\n<$B> \n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  you know there\'s\n\n  a lot to talk about there\'s a lot to discuss\n spend time in cleaning\n\nthe offices, and organize ourselves and stuff\n I said you know two weeks should be okay,\n that he\n\nwrote down all the notes about uhm <unclear> French </unclear> and stuff \n\n  and   how maybe   , uh you know\n\nit\'s   very hard to say no and it\'s very hard to plan    in advance  , because we were talking about those things\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  great but things come up\n Rapist we didn\'t\n\nknow was going to happen and a lot of our time this summer was devoted to\n\nthat\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n<$A> \n\n be inundated with home security visits\n\n<$B>  No\n\n<$A>  So, you know there\'s a fine line between planning planning\n\nand precisely   and then \n\n<$B>  you can\'t plan precisely for a\n\nyear\n\n<$A>  No,\n\n<$B> \n\n  community\'s   needs are\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  to find out you\n\nknow what should be done when\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Ya\n\n<$B>  But\n\n<$A>  So uhm, we started talking about evaluating and I\'m not\n\nsure    how   to do this\n Should I sit down with every staff member and start the process\n Should I fill out a form\n Like should I make a form, that you guys fill out on each\n\nproject, and put it together\n\n\n<$B>  used to do\n\nright\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  She used to fill out a form\n But, I don\'t know if it should be as much as the whole team\n\ntogether on one project because    not  \n\neverybody\'s involved in every project\n Maybe the people involved\n uhh\n\n ,  the   walks\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Ya\n\n<$B>  Because each one of us had a different, view on things and\n\noh ya this happened oh ya this happened,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\nit\'s   still not put on paper,   <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\n\n<$A>  know if she did or not\n\n<$A>  I haven\'t even\n\n<$B>  to\n\n  uh  ,  to   finish it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  my notes though\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n want     \n\n<$B>  It\'s still\n\n  very hard to put down on paper\n\n<$A>  Ya I know I know\n\n<$B>  Because where did it start and where does it finish, is\n\n<$A>  Ya\n want to\n\n  have written reports, on the whole year\n\n<$B>  be more\n Uh I mean if you want I could still do it on paper and it\'s going\n\nto be more like a graph at one point,    which \n\n  communities  did what,   and what\'s  to come\n the future outcome of it,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay I have,\n\n our\n\nactivities\n This isn\'t even it,\n\n You know the database that I made,\n\n<$B>  Ya\n I don\'t have the full one\n You never gave me the full one\n I gave you mine\n\n<$A>  Okay,\n Plus the board of directors want a report on what we\'ve been doing\n\n\n<$B>  it would also be great for the uhm next\n\nyear the end of the year I mean if we do this <unclear> two words </unclear>\n\n<$A>  So if I take\n but\n\n  everyone should be able to evaluate it and what we    want to   do next year\n\n\ncontinue\n\n\nLacombe Lamonde  to have it on a regular basis\n Do we not\n try like you know\n So if we go, alphabetically,\n Well there\'s some things\n\nthat  \n\n<$B>  Okay like Autographs should everybody individually\n\n<$A>  everyone\'s supposed\n\nto know how to do it and everyone has done it, now\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  example\n\nAutograph everybody does it,\n\n\ntype of form, for activities that are like that  ,  anything\n\nyou can think of and we write it down and then we get together and,\n\ncompare notes and then that\'s when we evaluate the program as a whole\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Ya\n That\'s a good idea\n And then Banking Security Project well obviously that\'ll be you\n\nand  Jack  sitting down\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm,\n\n<$A> \n\neveryone   anyone   can be invited, you know what  \n\nI mean\n\n\nhas a great idea about banking security or what if he\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  No I think everybody should do it\n I\'m not saying that we shouldn\'t get together\n Maybe like if\n Let\'s say we take those two weeks\n\n<$A>  Ya\n\n<$B>  Okay\n to\n\nindividually, do our things\n and then, like let\'s say the bank thing it\n\nwouldn\'t be individually\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  not including the whole gang\n\n<$A>  No\n\n<$B> ,\n\nthe whole   gang and just  , decide  is it worth it is\n\nit not uh    what   should we do next year if we\n\nhave to do it again and,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nbecause I\'d  like to give you all a couple of weeks to look it through\n\nand think,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  going to\n\n , be able to do like all of our activities in four days  \n\n<,>  or three days\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  No\n\n\n<$B> \n\nwe should do this now, and spend the   last two weeks together\n\nevaluating them together\n\n<$A>  Yup, yup,\n what would be some things that you\'d want to tell\n\n  in the evaluating what would be some things that you would want \n\n, everyone to know let\'s say with Autograph,\n You know what I mean\n,\n\n<$B>  Uhm\n\n<$A>  do about it\n\nis go through the files and see how many sessions were done how many  cars\n\n were done throughout the year\n\n\n year \n\n<$B> ,\n\n<$B>  Uhm\n\n<$A>  The best part of it the worst part of it how much time was\n\nused to prepare\n I don\'t know\n word\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$B>  of\n\nthe\n Half the paper has to be just general comment\n\n<$A>  Yup\n\n<$B>  Uhm,\n\n<$A>  Okay,\n\n<$B>  Because Autograph it\'s not something that we, do just by\n\nourselves\n does all the publicity\n\n<$A>  Ya\n\n<$B>  Uhm, it doesn\'t take as much time to prepare\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  But when we get there and we see that the publicity hasn\'t\n\nbeen done right, and you don\'t get any cards it\'s very frustrating so is\n\nit worth you know like,    what\n\nshould   we do at this point\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  ideas\n Like, they could be apart from new ideas\n Do we take this on ourselves\n have been\n\ntrained we can do it ourselves\n wanna\n\n  want to   do the cars here in the parking lot\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n<$A>  you know\n\napproach Queen  Meredith  Hospital\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n<$A>  These type of things,\n\n<$B>  Yup,\n\n<$A>  But okay so general comments,\n Okay\n activity will\n\nhave a sheet,\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n\nuhm the sheet   that she got\n She already\n\n<$A>  Old evaluation\n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n<$A> ,\n\nyou know uhm uhm uhm uhm uhm,\n Like the Activity Report, right\n\n<$B>  I think so\n I think so\n But I don\'t think we need all that information\n\n<$A>  No\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  have it\n\n<$A> \n\none-page things are for, to look back on\n For me anyway\n\n<$B>  Ya,\n I think it shouldn\'t be as detailed as that\n\n<$A>  No\n\n<$B>  Should be more\n Maybe it should just be a blank sheet with " Autograph\n\n" what does one person think about it and then, I don\'t know\n\n<$A>  That could be,\n\n<$B>  con\n\n   consideration   uh   \n\npreparation   uh    the   day itself,\n\njust to give you ideas you know cos when you start you might forget a certain\n\nthing and if you see it there,\n\n<$A>  Preparation the day itself\n What about strengths and weaknesses or you think everyone will\n\nknow to put them   in \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  in as a, you know\n\n<,,>\n\n<$A>  Strengths weaknesses,\n\n<$B>  Just to help you get, started on it\n\n<$A>  Ya,\n\n<$B>  Outcome,\n\n<$A>  Outcome,\n\n<$B>  Eventually too what I\'d like to do is remember we had the uhm\n\n<,,> you know the other office who did uh what all the activities are like\n\n   what you need to prepare \n\n\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n Eventually if this can go into a binder, and then slowly as the\n\nyear progresses\n\n\nwhat what   what   do you need blah blah blah blah\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Ya\n\n<$A>  that would be a\n\nparagraph  ,\n So eventually if someone new comes in\n\n<$B>  two words\n\n</unclear>\n\n<$A> \n Okay\n Well that would make sense\n to fill out\n\n<$B> \n Ya,\n\n<$A>  Then we sit down and we,\n\n<$B>  everything\n Uhm,\n I mean you don\'t even have to make a sheet with "\n\nAutograph " on it\n the\n\nuhm, uhm just saying the title of it,   and  then the few\n\nideas what to consider and give each person a list of what they

not finished,\n\n<$A>  The sixteenth, or the evaluation\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  to be,\n could let that drag on\n\nforever\n We really have to put an opening time and a closing time\n\n<$B>  What if we tell them though that we\'re painting, the\n\nfourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth\n\n<$A>  clean too,\n\n<$B>  Okay so put three days for cleaning\n might\n Well he can\'t say anything for us\n We\'re

we handled certain situations,\n\nuhm, might be uhm, embellished by, the conversation with her\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  could\n\nbe that there was a meeting held and I wasn't able, to go or something and\n\nso  ,     I   might\n\nbe   missing, a very key point\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  to\n\n  refresh my memory   because,  what I would like to do\n\n   is   perhaps, provide a little bit of\n\nbackground information for the committee\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Cos the committee, getting it cold might think well gee,\n\nwhy do we have to advise the community that we're moving in uhm, and uh I\n\nthink if they were a little sensitive to the fact that, here were, only\n\nthirty little babies wanting to move into a building and a whole community\n\nbecame very upset\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  your child being displaced for\n\nanother school  , would  upset, a   community\n\n    to a   great degree and so we have to\n\nreally, think about that\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Excellent point\n\n<$A> \n\nsensitize them to the issue, at the time that we present the change \n\n so  they understand the need for the, addition   uh\n\n to   the letter\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  tenor\n\nof the letter that I was talking about because it gives a very strong message\n\nto the board that,   \n\n<,> we are trying to look at   the larger picture as well\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  just our school but, the community\n\nthat we serve   and the  community that we are relocated to\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> , Okay\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  can't believe I asked myself for more work\n\n<$B> \n\nexactly the type of work    that    ,  you would   excel at and really uhm,\n Well, I found every time, that a document has gone out this\n\nyear, sending it out, uhm to people, like yourself, has made it a\n\nbetter document\n Every single time\n\n<$A> \n\nit's  , good to have a lot of opinion    \n\n on   , uhm, especially something that's going to the\n\nboard  , uhm  because I think    if you're representing  , the community, then\n\nit has to be a community effort\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A> \n\nreally wanted people to comment on the sexual   harassment policy,\n\nbecause , I wanted it to be a community thing\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  I didn't want it to be a one thing\n\n<$A>  yet uhm, I suppose\n\n<,> it's a difficult issue for a lot of people to deal with, uhm    and  , they may not, have had the opportunity to\n\nencounter, those kinds of issues in their day to day, work life in\n\nterms of policy setting   issues \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\nglad that I was able to help, uhm,\n It's only, unfortunate that, other people, uhm,\n\ncouldn't have shared in the experience or, maybe they could have, used\n\nthat to take, to their workplace, and insist that they had a policy,\n\nin place in their workplace\n\n<$B>  the lack of\n\nresponse to   my gut feeling was the lack of response was  \n\n<,> that, they, felt very comfortable with  , \n\nwhat   was said, and,    if   they\n\nread it  , and     I think that \n\n most if not everybody,  ,  read it  \n\nthoroughly\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  it\n\nwas fairly ,  there was something almost intimidating about it \n\n\n Do you know what I mean about the whole idea of it, and the\n\nwhole, uhm process\n\n<$B>  to\n\n  to   read it and   comment on it \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n  it's   something   that they might have\n\nfelt was a little over their, head\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$B>  tell you the truth uhm,\n\n ,  that was   uhm, part of my,\n\nfeeling\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n  \n\n<$B> \n\n    well first of all,    you \n\n   took it on and then you also used, not just your expertise\n\nbut other people's expertise\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  And so, that was that gave you uh uh confidence\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm\n\n<$B>  mother or\n\na father at the school reading this, it's a pretty heavy thing    and      to formally go up to\n\nsomeone   who's written something    and  \n\nmake a comment you    want to   feel,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  laugh\n\n \n\n<$A> \n\nisn't a     comfortable topic either\n\n<$B>  I would take it as\n\n  just a vote of confidence\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  I really\n\n  thought that that, was exactly, what it was\n\n<$A>  Mm hmm mm hmm\n I said uhm, when\n\nyou're representing a community you want to feel as if something has been a\n\ncommunity effort\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A>  something's for\n\n the   community  after all  \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  feel that you've\n\naccomplished something when it's been done, for the community as a whole\n\n ,  uhm,    and   with the\n\ncommunity\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  guess for\n\nthat reason that's why I sort of felt that there was a certain degree of\n\nemptiness  ,  in my   handing over the\n\ndocument   uh,  to the   board but uhm\n\n<,>\n\n<$B> \n\n  time  ,  another   topic and I\n\nthink we'll get\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\nlaugh  \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> \n\n one \n\n<$B> \n\n this goes  to, it's a pretty primary ,   \n\n it   deals    with   relocation \n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  That's\n\n     going to   hit all our children,\n\nand there are some  ,  very everyday \n\n, aspects to it that hit everybody's lives\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<,>  the   real   feeling <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$A> ,\n\n you can  , not attack but you can, get away with a lot\n\nmore, uhm, when you're dealing with people, about their issues but\n\nwhen you're dealing with them about their children's issues they get really\n\n  assertive  \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  becomes a different kettle\n\nof fish very quickly\n\n<$A> \n\nthat  uhm,  that   was held  ,  when, uh\n\nthere was discussion about the relocation of the school  , \n\nand an invitation, to, uh the parents that were there, to come,\n\nand participate, in   uh the  next uh, uh school committee\n\nmeeting\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  that I\n\nhad  never seen before\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  the date and the time and\n\n  where it was    going to   be held \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  would imagine that you're\n\ngoing to have, uhm, a somewhat of a larger turn-out than you what you\n\nwould normally have\n At least I would hope\n\n<$B>  Mm hmm\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  uhm\n\n<,>  it's also gone out  , with a little blurb in with our,\n\nschool committee\n\n<$B> \n\ncommittee highlights, to say you may have read about the uhm, \n\nLeedsman  school board uhm, uh resolution or whatever it was    to change   the, language\n\nof instruction uhm, of some schools in the  Leedsman  school board\n\nenclosure\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  or\n\nsomething  but  ,\n\n if affected  , uhm, we would like to be heavily involved\n Your school committee is already, in getting uhm, setting up\n\na meeting, on this issue, and uhm, we want to be sure, uh if we\n\nare affected, that we are part of the process and that we, uhm are\n\naware of the new facility we are moving into, and there will be a meeting\n\nof the school committee on, the twelfth of June\n All E P P parents are invited to come\n And the reason for that was school-wide we wanted to, plant\n\nthat   \n\n\n\n<$A>  The purpose of today's meeting, is to discuss the uh,\n\n Hammerstein  judgement\n\n<$B> , I would like nothing better than, to discuss this\n\njudgement with you  Adelaide \n Oh right weren't you a member of the winning party\n\n<$A>  forum\n\n\n\n<$B>  That must be quite exciting and I hear this was an action for\n\napproximately seven million dollars  , in damages  in a medical\n\nliability suit\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  That's right, it was and it was a very uh, long and uh\n\ncontentious process to bring to trial\n And as you know we encountered some difficulty, in, uh\n\ndealing with all the various issues that, arose, in this trial\n\nincluding uh, having to uh secure the uh presence of certain witnesses\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> , I guess the first order of business is to review the\n\nfacts, as set out in uh,  Luke Gerard's  judgement, in pages\n\n six to fifty  approximately\n So it's very factored in the judgement, which we're very\n\npleased with because it leaves very little room for appeal since only legal\n\nissues can be appealed\n\n<$A> \n\n,  you've   uh sort of digested I don't even\n\nthink I have but, I, am wondering whether or not on the fault issue\n\nitself there may be an opening for an appeal\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  Uh although he makes a determination, with respect to the\n\nfacts surrounding the fault issue, uhm,\n I think perhaps creative treatment of, how he deals with it\n\nmight, lead to an appeal\n\n<$B>  Well I think it's his only option for an appeal is to, dig\n\nup that question of fault and uh, examine it dissect it,\n\nextraodinarily thoroughly in the hopes that his appeal can succeed on that\n\npoint because as for the determination of the facts themselves I don't think\n\nthat there really is much room left for any other interpretation beyond that\n\nwhich  ,  Judge  Gerard  gave it\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Yeah\n\n<$A>  It's interesting eh because we were so, worried during the\n\ntrial about, whether or not all the points we were trying to make would\n\nactually, translate into the judgement\n the\n\njudge seems   to have really, listened to and review it in detail\n\nthe transcripts that we submitted on, all the fact issues uhm\n Although, uh there are some things which are still unclear but\n\none of the points that he does make is that, we are, attempting to,\n\ndetermine in terms of   uh,  the   timing issues\n\n<,> uh a very short period of time with approximate, estimates, of,\n\nwhat happened\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>", 'subdomain':

intermission,\n Puck fired down the ice by the Dinosaurs, and, back to pick\n\nit up is Trevor Sherben,\n Sherben takes a look\n He's a Bears supporter though I think\n good part the\n\nbell guy\n Tiltgen in there forechecking for it\n Schonek comes up with it\n Gets it around the boards\n Sherben has it on the right point\n He'll move in\n Lets the blast go\n That's blocked, by Couldwell,\n

Johnson, is going over to talk to referee Dave Shaw\n Calgary was getting the original penalty and then I think Degner\n\ndrew an, even-up call, and so the Bears stay on the power play,\n They have both gates open over at the penalty bench\n Pegg is going off for Calgary\n\n<$B>  And Pegg uh stick his knee out when Jickling was making a\n\nmove at the blue line on him and uh, Jickling drew a penalty but Terry\n\nDegner, he didn't really do anything too drastic uh but Lovsin came over\n\nand whacked him and Degner whacked him back with a slash and uh, the\n\nreferee decided to even that up\n And uh uhh bit of a bad play by Degner there cos he should just go\n Two-man advantage there for a minute the Bears would have had so\n\nthat one hurts a little bit\n\n<$A>  These penalties at seventeen twenty-four,\n One nothing Dinosaurs in front,\n Degner, two minutes for cross-checking,\n Pegg, two minutes for slashing\n I think Degner was mad because as he came across the blue line he\n\ngot dumped right at the blue line,\n The Bears might have had a two-on-one,\n He got dumped and uh went after the, Dinosaur player\n I don't know if he knew there was a penalty coming up\n\n<$B>  A minute and two seconds uhh still left in the Bears power\n\nplay though,\n\n<$A>  Bears with it off the faceoff\n Ruark gets to it for Calgary and he'll send it down the ice,\n Back to get after it

however the pass slightly behind him\n Bears have it\n Here's Jickling in across the line\n Trying to cut around Ruark,\n Lovsin took it out\n Haney to the line now\n Drop pass\n Bears, a little fortunate there\n Here's a shot by Esposito\n Puck rolls toward the net\n Haney kicks it into the corner,\n Ruark bumping with Aaron Zarowny\n Haney has it\n Takes a hit from Marble,\n Bears after that thing\n They get it up the wall\n Jickling lost it\n Lovsin, able to chip it out to centre ice,\n That's it for the power play\n Bears\n Esposito, will move it\n In across the line here's, Colin Zarowny moving in\n He shoots\n Save by Dawkins\n\n<$B>  Real nice heads-up play by Frank Esposito to see Zarowny\n\ncoming off the bench and hitting him in uh full speed\n Uh Colin had a good chance but uh didn't get much on the shot\n\n<$A>  Similar to the pass that Esposito tipped over to Strand on\n\nthe game winner in overtime last Sunday night\n\n<$B>  Very similar\n Frank's not the best

guess a smart move from Calgary's standpoint but uh, I mean\n\nif they're going to mess with you why don't they send one of their gunners\n\nout there to mess with one of your gunners,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  here\n\n<$B>  Who knows\n\n<$A>  Who knows the reasons these things happen,\n The goal scoring in that period Todd Johnson on the powerplay at\n\nfour thirteen\n Couldwell and Krywulak with assists\n It was a, two-man advantage a five-on-three powerplay, and\n\nthat was the only goal of the period\n The shots on goal in that period we'll get for you in just a moment\n\n<,>\n The shots, for Calgary nine, and for Alberta six\n So we thank the people here for that information,\n So for Calgary nine\n Alberta six,\n One nothing the score\n, two powerplays, for both teams, and the\n\ndifference I think, was clearly that five-on-three advantage that Calgary\n\ngot\n had one too if\n\nTerry Degner    hadn't have   taken that\n\npenalty\n\n<$B>  ref did even\n\nthings up there    and the   Bears would\n\nhave had a minute oh two with the five-on-three, which is  \n\n a   great opportunity and uh, Deigs is probably a little bit\n\nupset at himself right now\n\n<$A>  Let's take a time-out come back and hear from Mike Thompson in\n\nour first intermission\n It's the Calgary Dinosaurs one the Alberta Golden Bears no score in\n\nCanada West University Playoff hockey action\n Game two of this best of three division final, from the Clare\n\nDrake Arena in Calgary on Sports Radio C J S R F M eighty-eight \n\n<$A>  And so the second period moments away here\n Masson leads the Bears out\n Dawkins, leads Calgary out,\n And really if you recap that first like we've tried to do here\n\nDawkins was not forced to make a lot of saves\n Only six and, maybe one real, nice one, and that was off\n\nMike Thompson,\n And uh Thompson didn't get great wood on it\n But it was right off a faceoff win by Ken Simpson and Thompson,\n\ncorralled the puck and, flipped it toward the net\n Didn't get all the wood on it he would have liked but uh,\n\nDawkins stopped it anyway\n\n<$B>  gave up some juicy\n\nrebounds though\n He hasn't looked that sharp in stopping uh even the easiest shots\n\n\n have got to  , uh hope they get some better chances on him and\n\nget guys going to the net for rebound,\n\n<$A>  Two teams will be even-strength off the start of the second\n The Bears send, the law firm out there Zarowny Zarowny and\n\nSimpson,\n And Calgary, counters, with Johnson Couldwell and Krywulak\n\ntheir top line,\n And the Dinosaurs have the puck off the faceoff\n Ruark working from his own end\n Up the right-wing boards he goes\n Hammers it in across the line\n Round and round it goes\n Up the left wing now for Johnson,\n Sends it to the corner to Couldwell\n Back to Johnson\n He fell on the play,\n The Bears are able to clear\n Here's Simpson down the wing,\n Simpson on the right side\n Flipped it off the linesman\n Chops it into the corner now\n Was hit by Masters\n Colin Zarowny looking for it\n Racing in from the point is Hjertaas,\n Puts it in behind the net to the left corner for Simpson\n Simpson, will chip it deep, into the zone, for Colin\n\nZarowny\n He had it batted away and Krywulak shovels it out to centre ice\n\n<,>\n Bears send it right back in\n Here's Simpson, just inside the blue line\n Flips one toward the net\n Saved by Dawkins\n And then Aaron Zarowny smashes his man, as Ruark tried to clear\n Here they come though the Dinosaurs\n This is Johnson to centre,\n Johnson with the puck moves in\n Lets a shot go\n And boy did he hammer that thing wide\n They score off the rebound,\n It went off the glass and Johnson raced over and, slammed it in\n\nto the open net as Masson came diving across, in a desperate bid to,\n\nstop that thing\n He let a rocket go and everybody watched it\n\n<$B> \n Everybody watched it\n The reaction time there is not what it has to be,\n Two defencemen were back and Masson could have reacted faster\n He didn't react till he saw Johnson uh, lining up the rebound\n And the two defencemen just stood and watched the rebound come out\n And uh, Johnson's got a wicked shot for a small guy\n But uh there's no way in the world he, should have had a\n\nrebound that juicy\n\n<$A>  Johnson his second of the playoffs,\n Second of the night,\n It comes at the fifty-four second mark here of the second period\n There's Haney for it\n Now ahead to Esposito\n Drops it back for Pullishy,\n Pullishy working from his own zone\n Skates to centre\n Flips it deep into the corner,\n Esposito gets to it\n He lets a shot go\n Comes back to the left point,\n Here is Pullishy\n A long shot missed the net,\n And that's an unassisted goal, for Johnson\n Bears have it\n Here's Strand\n Across the line for Haney\n Haney moves in\n Shoots\n Saved, by Dawkins\n Nice stop\n His best of the night\n As Haney got all that one and Dawkins well out to challenge,\n\nmade it a fine glove save\n\n<$B>  Dawkins had to come up with a good save for once and he did\n Uh really nice\n Nice pass touch pass backhand by Paul Strand\n And uh, good wood by Haney\n He put his head down and, ripped it\n And Dawkins when he saw Haney put his head down he came out and uh\n\nwas able to make the save\n A nice glove save by Dawkins,\n\n<$A>  Draw will be to the stick-hand side of the Calgary goaltender\n\n<,>\n Last night the Bears, went up two nothing and lost the game\n Tonight the Dinosaurs are up by a pair,\n\n<$B> \n\n to,  face adversity tonight and come back\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B>  Uh not only the, series could be over they're down two\n\nnothing\n It's going to be tough,\n\n<$A>  Jickling on the faceoff, against Calgary's Townsend\n And Townsend won that one\n Goes back into the corner for Steveson\n Left corner for Zulyniak and he plays it up the wing for Marble\n Marble chipping it out to centre for Stephenson\n Stephenson can't get around Jickling,\n, zone,\n, it's cleared out to centre\n Just out of the reach of Thompson\n Two nothing Calgary in front here early in the second\n Long lead pass for Schmalz\n He's in on, the Bear defender Christiansen who took him out\n\n<,>\n Christiansen plays it ahead and away goes Thompson\n He's across the line\n Thompson takes a look\n Thompson, feeding it out front,\n Nobody there for Alberta, and the Dinosaurs'll just, send\n\nit down the ice\n That went off the linesman, otherwise it might have been icing\n\n<,,>\n Adair, now up the wall ahead for Degner and he steers it in\n\nacross the the Calgary line\n Dawkins stops it for Marble,\n Marble a long breakaway pass for the Bear line but that's picked\n\noff by Hjertaas\n Hjertaas will step across the line\n In for Colin Zarowny\n Zarowny lets a shot go\n And that's, deflected to the corner by Townsend\n Now a cross-ice feed to the right point\n Snapshot by Simpson\n He broke his stick on it or it was blocked in part by Townsend who\n\nlost his stick on it, and it dribbles in to goaltender Dawkins\n\n<$B>  That's the best the Bears have looked all night, since\n\nthat second goal by the Dinos\n Two good shifts in a row\n First by Jickling's line and now Zarowny's line\n The law firm came out and they're playing well,\n keep the green\n\nwave going on the Dinos and uh get some flow and get some momentum going\n\ntheir way\n Draw will be to the glove-hand side of Dawkins,\n Aaron Zarowny to face off against Thompson\n\n\nthere,\n Colin Zarowny now to take the draw,\n Bears have it\n Here's Hjertaas with a shot\n Pad save Dawkins,\n He had problems with it but he covers it up,\n on these faceoffs is, that\n\nif you're the home team, it makes a difference as to who puts their stick\n\ndown first\n Isn't it supposed to at least\n\n<$B>

 have come up big for the Bears\n They've played ah an excellent hockey game, the first forty\n\nminutes and uh the Bears could not let another powerplay goal in there and\n\nthey came up\n They got a nice bounce off a blocked shot\n And uh almost a breakaway for Ken Simpson but he did draw the\n\npenalty,\n minute and\n\n  minute  , seven seconds\n And this'll be exciting hockey four on four,\n\n<$A>  So Gatto goes to the penalty box\n Two minutes for hooking I believe,\n And the faceoff will be deep in Lethbridge territory stickhand\n\nside of Cavilla,\n mentioned four on four, four skaters on\n\nfour skaters as Jickling prepares to face off\n He wins the draw\n Now Goodkey lets the shot go\n That's blocked\n And here's a two-on-two for Lethbridge, as Zukiwsky gains the\n\nblue line\n Zukiwsky takes a look\n Falls on the play as he turned with the puck,\n And Pullishy plays it, over for Goodkey,\n There's a hooking penalty to Gatto,\n And here come the Bears in across the

to centre,\n And Goodkey with it behind the net\n Up for Jickling\n Strand had his stick and, his glove swept away,\n Zukiwsky bumping with Jickling\n Puts him in a headlock and there'll be a penalty

will have to set it up quick\n Degner takes a look\n Centres out front\n Pass behind everybody,\n That'll do it for the period\n Five seconds left as Trevor Sherben lets the long shot go\n It'll be whistled down but, Jarret Zukiwsky with not a real\n\nclever play there as he was bumped,\n was bumped by Jickling but as he's\n\nskating off he put Jickling in a, headlock\n\n\n, a great   penalty there was not a clever one by Mr Zukiwsky\n\n<$B> \n And it was a good play by Mike Jickling\n He took it\n He took the headlock took the face rub and, he just skated away\n He wasn't even talking to Zukiwsky\n He knew that he drew the penalty,\n Uh a good, heads-up play by Jickling, character play\n uh leadership for\n\nthis team\n\n\n, have a powerplay    early in the  \n\nthird period to see if they can tie this game up\n\n<$A>  One second, left, in the, second period, so\n\nthey'll do the ceremonial toss of the puck,\n Penalties Zukiwsky, two minutes for holding or headlocking,\n Degner, got a ten minute misconduct, as did Riehl,\n\n<$B>  Two minutes for unsportsmanlike conduct each Degner and Riehl\n\n<$A>  Pardon me\n\n<$B>  Two minutes,\n\n<$A>  All righty,\n\n\nstandpoint  I would think\n\n<$B> \n Definitely\n\n<$A>  Don't want to have Degner out for the first half of the,\n\nthird period\n They, toss the puck in and that's it for the second period,\n So Alberta in front four three through, two periods of play\n\n<,,>\n\n<$B>  going to the\n\nbox   going to the bench   right now cos uh, if Rob Daum\n\ndoesn't say anything to him    maybe  \n\nthat's his way but some coaches would uh, lay right in to Mr Tiltgen right\n\nnow\n And uh I'm not sure how Coach Daum does it but uh, I mean\n\nplayoff time it's two out of three\n There's no room for error\n\n\n sticking   a guy in the numbers uh for a obvious spear,\n\n<$A>  So again real quick on those penalties, the nineteen\n\nfifty-nine mark Degner, and Riehl two minutes each for unsportsmanlike\n\nconduct and then the original penalty to Jarret Zukiwsky, two minutes for\n\nholding\n The reason they gave uh Degner and Riehl penalties is cos they\n\nkind of milled about   , after the   fact\n\nafter the uh play was called and, referee doesn't like that of course\n Wants to keep a handle on things\n So, after forty minutes of play four three Alberta in front,\n\nof the\n Pardon me\n Lethbridge in front of the Alberta Golden Bears\n\n<$B>  And uh eighteen seconds the start of the third period ah a\n\nbig chance for the Bears\n have thirty-five\n\nseconds of two-man advantage, and ah ah a golden opportunity

tie it up,\n And in fairness to Mike Thompson I think the puck may have been\n\nrolling on edge but, a glorious opportunity goes for naught\n\n<$B>  was a\n\ntough shot you're right  Evan  cos it was

but Merv Haney and Mike Jickling\n\nget assists,\n That was at six forty-eight of the first\n And, the assists we didn't give you on Degner's goal in the\n\nsecond period Jickling and Thompson get credit, for assists on that one\n So, Bears trailing by a goal\n Here's Trevor Sherben to the line and across,\n He goes down as, he had a little help\n Pulled to the ice by Mark Wobick,\n Now Trevor Sherben, trying to send it in deep\n Here's a long,\n Well they tried the, long feed but, Jeremy Riehl thought\n\nbetter of it,\n Here goes Trevor Sherben\n almost in front of his\n\nown net\n was looking for it\n Haney in looking for the puck in uh Lethbridge territory, but\n\nGatto, fishes it free inside his own zone\n Bears pick it up though\n Haney now to Jickling\n Jickling, cycling it, in behind the net,\n Strand, didn't anticipate the pass and there is Carpenter with\n\nit,\n Carpenter trying to send it to the Bear line\n He cannot\n Degner with it now,\n Degner, drives in across the line\n Degner takes a look\n Can't get past the defence\n This could go as icing,\n Back to play it is Pullishy,\n As he touches it icing is the call\n Quickly what happened in that second period Terry Degner tied it\n\nup for Alberta on the powerplay at nine eleven\n Mike Jickling and Mike Thompson with assists,\n But then, Lethbridge pulled ahead again at eighteen eighteen\n\n<,,>\n Dana Rieder from Travis Kelln and, Harper,\n That came at eighteen eighteen on the powerplay\n So the Bears, trail the Horns four three as we play in the\n\nthird period here\n By the way the shots on goal in that second period, twelve four\n\nin favour of the Bears\n So they've outshot, Lethbridge thirty-one fifteen\n Lethbridge an opportunist team though,\n They've put four past, Masson in this one\n\n<$B>  wide of a\n\nmargin though\n\n<$A>  Shane Roest with it behind his own net for Lethbridge,\n He'll stride right out front,\n Skates with it\n Flips it up to Graham,\n They get it in across the line\n Esposito a chance to move it\n He cannot\n It's kicked in a little deeper\n Now Esposito will battle for it,\n Flips it up to the point not out\n Puck sails wide of the Alberta goal,\n And after the puck Adair able to poke it out to centre ice,\n Flipped back in by Knippel\n Goes off the back boards and Krywko's there to play it,\n Krywko starts from his own end\n Flips it ahead,\n Here's Degner on the right wing\n Degner takes a look\n in across the line\n Takes a backhand shot, and a stick save by Cavilla\n There looked to be a little bit of room there\n Here's a shot by Adair,\n Saved by Cavilla,\n And he'll hold on with fourteen seventeen to go in the third\n Tune in tomorrow night\n We'll have game two of this best-of-three series\n We're on with our pregame show at seven o'clock,\n The game starts at seven thirty\n Pretty good crowd down here\n Although it'd be nice to see an even a larger one tomorrow night\n\n Jeff \n\n<$B>  It could be better\n is\n\n  showing some leadership out here,   \n\nuhh, in the first   six minutes of this third period\n He's playing heads-up hockey\n He's making some nice plays,\n And he's not giving the puck away\n told uh\n\nin    the  , pep talk in between periods for \n\n  their   d-men  to throw it in\n\nfront of their net a half dozen times    \n\nat the   start of the third period\n It's been scary here,\n\n<$A>  On the draw, Dana Rieder wins it away from Aaron Zarowny\n\nand, it's cleared out to centre ice by the Lethbridge Pronghorns\n Trevor Sherben will fire it right back in\n Back to pick it up, Mike Krooshoop\n He gave it away at the blue line\n Trevor Sherben, put it right back on his stick,\n And it's cleared down to the Bear line\n Here goes O'Rourke moving in\n O'Rourke trying to

{'text': "<$A>  The pride of Saint John New Brunswick Heidi Hanlon, in her\n\nquiet unassuming way, has arrived at the threshold of curling glory,\n Last night she used a lot of perseverance and some timely shot\n\nmaking, to lead her rank to an extra end semi-final victory over curling\n\nlegend, Heather Houston of Thunder Bay Ontario,\n This rock made it all delightfully official, a nine seven,\n\nextra end victory\n The Hanlon team was moving on into the final\n interview with Heidi\n\nHanlon \n Heidi knows that the big teams are all gone now, except for the\n\none that's waiting in the wings,\n Julie Sutton has made the B C champions one of the biggest of all\n\n<,>\n This exuberant rank is relaxed, and looking towards its first\n\never, National final,\n And Julie Sutton certainly knows how to win the big one\n She's proved that\n Six years ago she captured her first National Junior title, then\n\none year later, she skipped her rank to a second Canadian Junior\n\nchampionship, and in nineteen eighty-eight, Julie racked up the first\n\never, World Junior, Women's Crown,\n This is her second appearance, in a Scott Tournament of Hearts\n Her first run at the National title in nineteen eighty-nine in\n\nKelowna, fell just short,\n Now she's back, and the other ranks have been trying to catch up\n\nall week,\n That's how Julie likes it,\n\n One of the prizes could be claimed in Albertville France next\n\nFebruary, where today's winner will represent Canada at the sixteenth\n\nWinter Olympic Games,\n Momentum will be crucial to get there, and the Sutton rink has\n\npicked up a full head of steam \n Julie Sutton like Heidi Hanlon, is looking at her first ever\n\nNational Women's Title, and Sutton has never lost in a championship final\n\n<,,>\n Today the hot hands square off in this cold prairie city\n From Saskatoon it's the tenth edition of the Scott Tournament of\n\nHearts, and Canada is about to crown, a new curling queen,\n Here at Saskatchewan Place we're just moments away from the opening\n\nceremonies that will precede today's championship game, involving British\n\nColumbia and New Brunswick\n Hi everybody I'm Don Whittman and pleased to be working again,\n\nwith two-time world champion, Don Duguid\n Don the fact that, British Columbia defeated New Brunswick eight\n\ntwo on the first draw of round-robin play, will that be a psychological\n\nadvantage for Julie Sutton today\n\n<$B>  I really think so\n Anytime that you beat uh the opposing team in the final in the\n\nround-robin play, it is a real advantage and not only that she beat her\n\n handily , but uh you know uh Hanlon's coming on very strong played\n\na great game last night, and I think Julie's    going\n\nto   have to be on top of her game\n\n<$A>  Well Hanlon had to get some inspiration from the fact that she\n\ncame from behind, to defeat a former world champion Heather Houston last\n\nnight in the semi-final\n\n<$B>  going to\n\n  get blown out early Don but she hung in there made some great shots\n\nto keep her team in the game\n Her percentages weren't that high but she played excellent in the\n\neighth and ninth end and that won her the game so you know uh, she's\n\nplaying strong and it's going to be a great great game\n\n<$A>  This is the tenth anniversary of the Scott Tournament of\n\nHearts, and this year's event in Saskatoon, has some fond memories for\n\n<,> another member of our broadcast crew who won the very first, Scott\n\nTournament of Hearts in Regina \n A little more subdued on this visit to Saskatoon than she was ten\n\nyears ago\n Colleen nice to have you working with us again\n You, got off to a great start in this year's championship\n\nwinning your first three, but then you had some problems   but\n\nyou're down  at ice level and you're going to, tell us, what these\n\n<,> ladies are thinking and uh, what the competition   will be\n\nlike \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C> \n\nthey're really nervous but talking to both skips just moments ago they're\n\nreally confident and uh both teams    are  \n\nplanning on winning this thing\n terrific teams\n Julie Sutton plays, very very wide open and on this kind of ice\n\nit seems to be the strategy that works the best\n Heidi Hanlon though is willing to mix it up\n We saw it last night against Heather Houston\n She's willing to put rocks in play and gamble and go for it and\n\nshe's coming up with the right shots at the right time\n The ice has been a factor all week\n they're\n\nplaying on, it curls more than any of the others so I think we will be\n\nable to see a few rocks in play\n Don\n\n<$A>  B C with a record of ten and one during the week\n New Brunswick with a record of eight and three\n yesterday of course, and\n\nNew Brunswick, had to await, two tie-breaking games before,\n\ndetermining that they would face, Ontario in the semi-final\n At this time we welcome, other stations along the network that\n\nhave just joined us for our live coverage, of the Scott Tournament of\n\nHearts championship game from Saskatchewan place, in Saskatoon\n The opening ceremonies where the two competing teams will be\n\nintroduced just about to get under way\n During the course of the week crowds have been, very large here\n\nat Saskatchewan place\n As a matter of fact, an attendance record for this event has\n\nbeen established\n Better than seventy thousand spectators have, taken in\n\nproceedings, and they're looking for close to four to five thousand to,\n\nwatch this championship game\n The two competing ranks, British Columbia and New Brunswick,\n\nnow being piped into Saskatchewan place,\n Heidi Hanlon, three times in the past has been a competitor,\n And this is the most successful, performance of the Scott\n\nTournament of Hearts for Heidi Hanlon and her New Brunswick crew,\n They of course would like to cap it all with a victory today but\n\nJulie Sutton of British Columbia, has some ideas of her own,\n Julie Sutton has never lost in a championship game, in a zone\n\nplaydown, in a provincial playdown, or in a national or world final\n She of course the nineteen eighty-eight, World Junior champion\n\n<$B>  Well if you're Heidi Hanlon that's pretty frightening you know\n I mean here you are in a final and this uh, uhm, Julie Sutton\n\nhasn't lost a final    it's   pretty scary \n\n<$A>  Well I'm sure Don Duguid that uh, there are butterflies in\n\nthe stomachs of all ten women down on the ice\n The four who will be playing, and the fifth player and in\n\ninstances coaches\n\n<$B>  Yes you're very very nervous right at the start of a game but\n\nyou get in the hack throw the first rock or brush the first rock, you \n\n  kind of   lose the butterflies and get into the\n\nflow of the game but, before you start you are very very nervous\n\n<$A>  Elaine Jackson, who is the, fifth player and the coach\n\nof the B C team was of course a member of, the championship squad, that\n\nwon the World title, a couple of years back in, Chicago\n And Heidi Hanlon, has as her fifth player her mother, Ellen\n\nBrenner, who has been a longtime New Brunswick competitor and a rival on\n\nthe curling ice in the province of New Brunswick, over the years and,\n\nis the fifth member of this New Brunswick team\n\n<$B>  Well a great steadying influence, to have your mother not\n\nonly as your coach but she's there with you all the time I think that's super\n\n<$A>  Last night it looked as though the New Brunswick women were\n\ngoing    to   be in serious trouble, against,\n\ntwo-time Canadian champion Heather Houston of Thunder Bay\n It seemed on the first three ends that every time she went to throw\n\nHeidi Hanlon was looking at three or four, Ontario stones\n She, managed to persevere, and then on the eighth end cracked\n\na big three to uh take the lead\n Stole another one, on the ninth for a two point lead heading\n\nhome\n Some thought that perhaps her chances of advancing to the final,\n\ndisappeared when she,  whiffed  a, wide open takeout on the\n\ntenth end to enable, Ontario to pick up a pair and tie the match but she\n\ncame back, and she was right on target with her final stone at the extra\n\nend\n\n<$B>  Well now it wasn't an easy hit\n It looked fairly easy Don you know it was on the, in-turn side\n\n<,> and uh, any time you're throwing away out towards the boards it's uh\n\nnot an easy hit and she just threw it just beautifully and made great contact\n\nwith it\n Uh but you know the early part of that game, they really\n\nstruggled, and I thought uh maybe Heather Houston might get away from them\n\n<,> but they hung in there, as you have to do\n never give up in a curling\n\ngame never ever, no matter if you're four or five down\n\n<$A>  B C will have the advantage of last rock on this opening end\n\n<,> as Mary Harding gets this championship game started,\n She has only been curling for six years,\n Didn't take up the sport until she was thirty years of age\n\n<$C>  Mary replaces uh, Heidi's original lead Judy Blanchard who\n\nhad a baby on December twenty-fourth but Judy Blanchard is uh home in New\n\nBrunswick watching anxiously and she's, played for Heidi for years and\n\nyears\n\n<$A>  She has been in almost daily contact with the New Brunswick\n\nrink offering words of encouragement,\n\n<$B>  Well you know the responsibility of the lead of course is to\n\nalways put the rock where the skip wants it, but in this case uh, Heidi\n\nHanlon said no Mary we    want to   get the first\n\nrock in, so I can see uh how keen it is and whether it's changed from our\n\npractice session and if it's    going to   change\n\nin, direction or movement a bit\n\n\ng ,  a   good responsibility of the lead to make sure that\n\nyou're up and in the rings, the very first down\n\n<$A>  Karri Willms, who is a uh, History of Arts student at\n\nthe University of Victoria removed that New Brunswick stone\n And now, Mary Harding the New Brunswick lead, is again being\n\nasked to play in a stone, at the top of the twelve foot\n\n<$C>  You were talking about the perseverance of this Heidi Hanlon\n\nrink and I know that, playing against them a lot in the Maritimes, they\n\nnever ever give up\n They're always there and they never panic\n You'll see some teams they'll get down a couple of points and panic\n\nand start throwing badly but not this team,\n They have a lot of character\n\n<$A>  Mary Harding's stone coming to rest a little deeper than skip\n\nHeidi Hanlon really wanted\n So now Julie Sutton is asking for a hit on this stone from her lead\n\nKarri   uh  Willms  \n\n<$B>  Uh you can see from the ice, that Julie Sutton has given\n\nKarri that, there is very little movement to the rock\n She put the brush right on the edge of the rock so it means it runs\n\nvery very straight, with takeout weight\n\n<$C>  Karri was telling me that she was absolutely thrilled to be\n\nasked to play uh with the Sutton, girls at the beginning of the year\n She travelled throughout Europe last year and she was so excited to\n\nget back into the game especially at this level,\n\n<$A>  Members of the Sutton rink were taking a look at that stone\n\njust to the uh, left of the, sheet of ice to see whether or not it was\n\na biter but uh on our overhead camera we saw it was just outside the rings\n B C a lie in one, and Sherri Stewart of New Brunswick second is\n\nattempting the removal of that stone", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$B>  Now that's a good shot for our viewers Don\n just touched that rock and\n\nbecause it is very very keen, it slid out of the ring so you can see how\n\nvery very fast the ice is\n You can hit almost three quarters of a rock and your shooter's,\n\nuh, very difficult to stay, so it's very keen,\n\n<$A>  Melissa Soligo, the, British Columbia, second, now\n\nattempting to place one in the rings\n You'll notice the, rushes that the B C rink is using\n We'll talk a little more about those later in the telecast,\n They're trying to take advantage of that stone just outside the\n\nrings over on the left-hand side of your screen,\n They'd ideally like to get it just in behind that rock but it,\n\nappears as though it's going to pull up just a little short,\n Colleen you were telling us that your experience on this ice\n\nparticularly on this centre sheet there's more movement to the outside of the\n\nrings then there is down the centre line\n\n<$C>  Interestingly enough with this sheet they had to reflood it\n\ntwice uh because of a few problems, and this sheet does move a lot more\n\nthan  ,  the other   uh sheets but you\n\nhave to pick your spot\n It is swingy here on the in-turn side that Sherri is throwing for\n\nthis in-turn draw\n It will move\n But if you try to come the other way on the out-turn to bury around\n\na centre-guard it doesn't move as well\n\n<$A>  Is there any reason Don why they wouldn't have attempted to go\n\n<,> to the other side of the house and in behind those two, corner guards\n\n ,  belonging to, B C\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  so\n\nif she goes in behind then that's an opportunity for Julie Sutton  ,  to   follow her down and may score  two points\n\nin that area\n She wants to play, away from those two corner guards\n Those two guards on the left actually are in favour of Julie Sutton\n\n<$A>  So without last rock she wants to keep play to the open side\n\nof the   ice \n\n<$B>  yes, and in the centre\n That rock really moved over a little bit too far, and it's very\n\nhigh\n It's not in the rings,\n So they may be able to hit and roll behind cover with this one\n\n<$A>  hit it on the\n\nother side\n She's going to roll the opposite direction,\n The stone just delivered by Melissa Soligo rolls out of play,\n\n<$C>  You always like in this first end to have this opportunity to\n\n ,  throw a   draw, without having the\n\npressure of knowing that uh you could be a little deeper a   uhm,  little   light still\n So you're still kind of working on your draw weight even though the\n\ncurlers get practice time   uh,  before the \n\n game, a lot of timing lapses between practice time and actual game\n\ntime\n\n<$A>  The delivery by Sheri Stewart on an attempted draw, over on\n\nthe right-hand side, came up short and this one by Kathy Floyd, also\n\n<,> pulls up short\n\n<$B> \n\n take advantage of this one Don\n You see the rock is away off to the side\n Sutton will gamble\n\nin that area, and if it doesn't work out for her and there's a whole bunch\n\nof rocks in there, uh by the opposition, she simply has the full range\n\nto draw  to \n But if those rocks were more into the centre, how do you get\n\ninto the four-foot,\n So when you have last rock you play it at the sides, and when\n\nyou do not have last rock you play into the centre\n\n<$A>  Julie and Jodie Sutton are twins, obviously not identical\n Julie is, sixteen minutes older\n I suggested that is perhaps the reason she is the skip\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  Jodie skipped the team that they won their first Canadian\n\nJunior title with and uh at that year they didn't go on to a world\n\nchampionship cos there was no World Junior championship for women at that\n\ntime\n That's a beautiful shot\n\n<$B>  Isn't that a gorgeous curling shot at the very first end,\n That's very pretty,\n\n\ndropping that rock short of the rings\n\n<$A>  You heard the, instruction from Heidi Hanlon to her third\n\nKathy Floyd\n Just enough weight to, push that red, B C stone, out of\n\nthe rings,\n\n<$B>  Well there's another good shot,\n\n<$A>  So with the hit and roll New Brunswick now lies one,\n\n<$B>  Well that's an excellent shot\n Good control, of her takeout weight by Kathy Floyd\n and\n\n  or   the rock may have fallen back against the turn a bit\n So that was good control of your weight\n That is very important on this ice\n It's weight, sensitive ice,\n\n<$C>  This Sutton rink they're, one of the strongest hitting\n\nteams I've ever seen from a women's team before, and, they don't\n\nbelieve they can miss a hit which is    a\n\nmarvelous confidence   to have\n\n<$A>  Well Elaine Jackson, the fifth player and the coach was\n\ntelling me that during a week of round-robin competition, skip Julie\n\nSutton missed, just, one hit\n\n<$B>  That's unbelievable,\n That is an unbelievable, situation\n uhm\n\n\n\n<$C>  talking to Julie uh moments before the\n\ngame and I asked her what kind of shot do you want to win it and she said the\n\nsame shot you had in eighty-two \n A wide open hit\n\n<$A>  Do you think she would react the same way\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  I think that may have inspired the sport of bungee jumping\n\nthat performance of yours in Regina ten years ago   now \n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  in\n\nRegina  \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  I needed one,\n\n<$B>  She wants to hang around with her shooter\n roll out of\n\nthe rings\n\n<$A>  Well she changes the shot for Julie Sutton with the hit and\n\nroll, into the back of the eight foot\n\n<$B>  Now you know why she wants to stay with that takeout Don,\n\nis the fact that if she rolls out then it'll allow uh, British Columbia to\n\ndraw around any one of those corner guards\n\n<$A>  Now Heidi Hanlon is forcing the play on that shot stone,\n unless it really goes big that way\n\nI'd rather take it to the centre \n\n<$C>  Unless it curls a lot, and then she'll roll behind the\n\ncorner guard if not she wants to roll to the centre\n\n<$B>  The rock really finishes big at the end\n have to go hard on it to\n\nget a piece of it\n\n<$A>  So with Julie Sutton hitting and rolling out, several\n\noptions now for Heidi Hanlon,\n\n<$B>  I turned it over a bit\n\n\n What she means is that she rolled her wrist, and the rock made a\n\nmotion inside the broom\n\n\ngo   clean,\n It's a common habit, of a lot of curlers throwing the in-turn\n They roll their wrist over, and the first reaction of the rock\n\nis to the inside of the intended target,\n\n<$A>  They're not going to get it past that guard\n She was trying to sneak behind, that New Brunswick guard and\n\nget it in there but they are going to get a bit of a break cause they're\n\ngoing to, rub off that guard and, catch, a bite of the twelve foot\n\nto lie one,\n\n<$B>  I said a common habit with a lot of curlers and you heard\n\nHeidi say  I must've turned it in \n\n<$C>  From down here on ice level she didn't look like she threw it\n\nbadly at all\n don't\n\nthink they anticipated that big a swing right there,\n Because it is swinging a little bit more on that in-turn side than\n\nit had been during the week,\n\n<$B>  Now if Julie Sutton hits this rock right on the nose it'll be\n\na blank end and that's exactly what she, would like,\n Either that or a shooter, roll away, not stay in the rings\n\n<,,>\n She may end up in the rings\n\n<$A>  Yes she is going to catch a piece of the twelve foot\n She really did not want that with last stone\n She wanted to count more than one\n Now they are not removing the other stone at the top of the twelfth\n They may call for a measurement here\n From our overhead camera perspective it would appear, that that\n\nstone is out of play but they are going to ask for a measurement, to\n\ndetermine whether or not that rock is biting\n I don't think it is but, you have the opportunity to measure why\n\nnot\n\n<$C>  We did test the rings uh during the week to make sure they're\n\naccurate and the rings here are fairly accurate\n When it looks out it usually is\n\n<$A>  And indeed it is out of play so it's a, score of one for\n\nBritish Columbia, on the opening end\n Julie Sutton with last rock was hoping to blank, but her final\n\nstone, caught a piece of the twelve foot, and she picks up a single\n\npoint and after one end of play in the championship game it's B C one New\n\nBrunswick nothing \n\n<$A>  Nineteen eighty-nine B C championship nineteen ninety-one B C\n\nchampionship,\n Will there be a Canadian championship to add to her list of\n\ncredits,\n She leads one nothing playing this second end against Heidi Hanlon\n\nof New Brunswick, but has relinquished last rock advantage to New\n\nBrunswick\n You know it's been four years since a British Columbia rink won\n\nthe Canadian Women's Championship\n It's been twenty-eight years since a rink from New Brunswick,\n\ncaptured the Canadian title\n That was Mabel DeWare back in nineteen sixty-three\n\n<$C>  I think Heidi's following the uh cue set by Jim Sullivan who\n\nof course was in the Brier final but lost to Ed Werenich last year\n That perhaps gave her a little extra bit of confidence knowing\n\nthat uh, New Brunswickers can curl and can curl well\n\n<$A>  Colleen would that suggest, with the success that Jim\n\nSullivan had last year at the Brier in Sault Saint Marie and what, Heidi\n\nHanlon has accomplished here in Saskatoon at the, Scott Tournament of\n\nHearts that, curling in New Brunswick is on the rise\n\n<$C>  Curling in New Brunswick is very very strong\n One of the problems that eastern teams face though is that,\n\nit's a numbers game\n There are so few curlers to draw from still just because our\n\npopulations are smaller,\n But certainly curling there is extremely strong\n\n<$B>  Well they must have a good program because uhm, both Heidi\n\nHanlon and Jim Sullivan team if you watch them throw the rocks  ,  they're   almost flawless in their curling\n\ndeliveries which means they spend a lot of time at it, and any time that\n\nyou got a good curling delivery you're going to be very successful,\n And they're playing it very wide open here, and uh, the\n\nthing that you notice when they play it wide open is that, they hit the\n\nrock almost on the nose every time Don\n ten\n\nrocks played   in this end, and they've hit the rock on the nose\n\nnine times\n One excepting was the roll over to the position, where it is\n\nnow so that tells you, that they are very very accurate,\n And wouldn't you know it as soon as I said that, they hit and\n\nroll out\n\n<$A>  But the important part is, she did make contact with the\n\nopposition stone and removed it from the rings,\n And with the time clock, being used here at the Scott\n\nTournament of Hearts, very little wasted time between shots\n\n<$C>  The time clocks have certainly been a marvelous addition to\n\n<,> curling not just for television viewers at home but for the curlers\n\nthemselves who don't like slow games\n And none of the curlers all week have been in any danger of uh\n\nbeing close to having to forfeit a game because they've run out of time\n Each side gets seventy-five minutes and it works much like uh,\n\na chess clock in speed chess where it stops and starts whoever has control of\n\nthe rings", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source':

their quest for gold and of course all eyes\n\nin Canada, will be on Kurt Browning\n Browning trying to win the gold medal at the World Championships for\n\nthe third year in a row\n Now remember, in addition to Browning there are two other men\n\nskating for Canada in the Singles in the original program tonight\n They are Elvis Stojko from Richmond Hill Ontario, and Browning's\n\nEdmonton team mate Michael Slipchuk\n No question though, the focus tonight in our telecast is going\n\nto be the Pairs' and the Freeskating portion of that event\n The reason is, Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler are the\n\nleaders heading into tonight's free portion,\n Should they win they will join a long and distinguished list of\n\nCanadian Pairs' champions, Frances Dafoe and Norris Bowden, Barbara\n\nWagner and Robert Paul of course Otto and Maria Jelinek their triumphant\n\nreturn to Czechoslovakia, and most recently in nineteen eighty-four in\n\nOttawa, Barbara Underhill and Paul

right now our focus is the men's original program\n It seems that, so many great champions have had great\n\nchallengers to push them, and that's the case for Kurt Browning being\n\npushed by Viktor Petrenko\n\n<$C>  Well, certainly everyone knows that this original program\n\n<,> centres around Kurt and Viktor\n Technically, they are equals\n Artistically, they are opposites\n classical skater and Kurt is the\n\ndynamic and exciting skater, and if both, skaters, complete all the\n\neight required elements it's going to come down to a competition between two\n\nvery contrasting styles\n\n<$B>  Paul, Kurt isn't the only Canadian who could be a factor\n\nhere\n\n<$D>  That's right Chris\n With Elvis Stojko and Michael Slipchuk, behind Kurt Browning,\n\nwe have the potential to match the Pairs' performances of last night by\n\nputting three men in the top ten, which in a field of thirty-four is \n\n  going to   be quite an accomplishment\n\n<$B>  It's going to be very interesting and we begin with the first\n\nof three Canadians, Michael Slipchuk of Edmonton \n Michael is attending his fourth World Championships\n He's hoping to improve on last year's eleventh place showing in\n\nHalifax\n He also considers himself Canada's luck charm\n In his three previous Worlds, a Canadian has won the World\n\nChampionship with Slipchuk in attendance,\n\n<$C>  Michael's first element is his combination the triple axle,\n\ndouble toe,\n\n<$D>  Unfortunately it appears from here as though that jump the\n\nfirst one the triple axel was over-rotated\n I mean that's one of the more difficult triples to do, and it's\n\none that all the top competitors here are trying,\n\n<$C>  No problem with the triple toe,\n\n<$D>  I must say that in Michael's four years of attending the World\n\nChampionships his most improved aspect of his skating has been his level of\n\nperformance\n He really goes out there and tries to sell the program get his\n\naudience involved, and make it look like he's having fun and, enjoying\n\nhis skating\n\n<$C>  Well I think he's really comfortable with this program\n It's the second year for this program and it, really seems to\n\nsuit him,\n Stray Cat Strut he's skating to\n\n<$D>  Aside from his one mistake in his jump combination I thought\n\nhe did an excellent performance, and he looked really, comfortable and\n\nreally covered a lot of ice out there today\n\n<$C>  thought he almost, relaxed\n\nafter the first element was over\n He knew he'd missed it but he continued on and he had a great\n\nperformance after that\n\n<$A>  Michael Slipchuk of the Royal Glenora, in Edmonton\n He was third at the Nationals but just getting, over a bad case\n\nof Strep Throat\n\n<$C>  Here's a look at the trip axel\n He just didn't seem to get all the way around in the rotation,\n\n<$D> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$D>  You have to remember here that in the short program you have\n\nto, attempt the element if you wish to get merit for it\n So therefore, if you don't attempt the second jump even though\n\nyou've missed the first one in the    combination\n\n , you won't get any, marks for it\n\n<$B> \n\nseventy percent in Saskatoon but he feels great now\n He's had time to, get in shape and, that should improve his\n\nlong program from, what we saw in Saskatoon\n\n<$C>  Well unfortunately with the early draw as well I think, the\n\nmarks are    going to   be a little bit lower,\n\nthan we had hoped\n\n<$B>  And here are the first set of marks for Michael Slipchuk\n There are fives but, a four point five from the Japanese judge\n\nas well as the American judge,\n He talks it over with his coaches you know Mark on the right they\n\nhaven't caught him on the left\n And the presentation marks are higher\n i\n\n,  two   scores in the fours from the Japanese and American\n\njudge, once again\n Right now early in the competition Michael Slipchuk of Canada is in\n\nsecond place,\n Viktor Petrenko of the Soviet Union is getting his last-minute\n\ninstructions\n More from the World Figure Skating Championships in Munich,\n\nafter this \n\n<$A>  And on this Tuesday evening welcome back to the Olympiahalle\n\nin Munich Germany\n C B C's continuing primetime coverage of the nineteen ninety-one\n\nWorld Championship\n Still to come tonight, Canadians Lloyd Eisler and Isabelle\n\nBrasseur go for gold in the Pairs\n You know, whether it's the Pairs' or the Men's Singles,\n\njumping is a very important part of this sport\n In tonight's installment of The Perfect Sixes, to explain the\n\nevolution of jumping in skating, once again here are Barbara Underhill and\n\nPaul Martini \n\n<$B>  Viktor Petrenko of the Soviet Union is one skater who has\n\ntaken the art of jumping to new heights\n At ice level, it almost appears as if he's jumping over the\n\nboards\n And he is, the, main challenger, for Canada's Kurt\n\nBrowning\n\n<$D>  Chris I'm extremely excited about this program because Viktor\n\nhas an outstanding history of being a  consistently short program\n\nskater\n\n<$C>  He's opening with the big combination, triple axel,\n\ntriple toe loop,\n\n<$D>  Absolutely gorgeous combination,\n\n<$C>  The next jump will be a trip lutz,\n Perfect,\n\n<$D>  Even note the arm position in the landing of that jump\n He's got such control out there,\n\n<$D>  Viktor attains such clean positions in his, spins and it's\n\na nice,  feature that he has and not a lot of skaters have,\n\n<$C>  I find that every single move that he makes is a conscious,\n\neffort and he knows exactly where his body is at all times\n Very controlled,\n\n<$D>  Chris, I thought that's the finest program we've seen here\n\nso far in this competition\n Many people might say that Bizet's Carmen has been done before,\n\nbut when you do it like this, you got nothing to be ashamed of\n\n<$B>  Well he won the original program in Halifax, and he\n\ncertainly has thrown down the gauntlet for Kurt Browning here\n Standing ovation, and that includes this, large contingent\n\nof Canadians\n They love great skating and we've just witnessed it\n\n<$D>  The thing that is most impressing about this program is the\n\npackage\n From the minute he steps on the ice to the minute he finishes,\n\nit's a complete unit\n It's what every skater strives for\n\n<$C>  Here's a look at the combination the triple axel, triple\n\ntoe loop\n Look at the height on that jump\n Perfectly in control,\n And the triple toe loop, just gorgeous\n\n<$D>  It had as much flow going in as it had coming out\n\n<$C> \n\narms and the landing shows such control, and such confidence,\n\n<$B>  Well there's no doubt these are first place marks and look at\n\nthem five eights and five nines for, technical merit\n\n<$C>  be a\n\nreally tough program to beat\n have to\n\npull one  ,  out   of the hat today\n\n<$B>  It's interesting though they have left room for Kurt\n A lot of five eights there\n\n<$D>  Well they must\n You must remember that Kurt Browning is the defending world\n\nchampion\n\n<$B>  And the second set of marks, the artistic marks five nines\n\na five seven from, the Canadian judge Mary Pearson five eights and five\n\nnines the rest of the way\n Undoubtably, the, best original program we've seen so far\n Viktor Petrenko, is the leader,\n Kurt Browning is getting his final instructions from coach Michael\n\nJiranek\n TV\n\nAdvertisements  \n\n<$B>  Well Munich is a very special place for Michael Jiranek\n He and his wife Renata defected, to the west through the\n\nBavarian capital and he hopes that Kurt Browning can create more fond\n\nmemories this week, as the skaters go through, their final warm-ups\n And Barb and Paul what an interesting group, we have out on the\n\nice\n\n<$B>  Todd Eldredge Elvis Stojko of\n\nCanada and Christopher Bowman\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D>  Chris as we watch them warm up, I'd like to, point out\n\nthat in the short program there are eight required elements no more no less\n\nthat must be, executed in this program\n They include a jump combination the most critical element,\n\nwhich must be any two jumps executed back to back consisting of double or\n\ntriples, however there should not be a step in between\n They must do an individual triple jump which must be preceded by\n\nsome footwork steps, a double axel, a combination spin, a flying\n\nspin, and another spin of their own creation which must have at least\n\nfifteen rotations, and two, different, sequences of footwork\n\n<$C>  I'd also like to point out that, Kurt, and Viktor are\n\nvirtually, equal when it comes to their technical   \n\nabilities  , but what the judges are    going\n\nto   have to decide upon is, which style they prefer because their\n\nstyles are completely contrasting\n\n<$B>  There's Christopher Bowman\n Todd Eldredge just fell\n that important this close\n\n<$D>  something that can\n\nrattle some skaters where other skaters will just, fluff it off and won't\n\neven let it enter their head\n\n<$B>  Now what's in Kurt Browning's head right now\n He knows Viktor Petrenko, has skated a brilliant original\n\nprogram but he also knows that in Saskatoon, he earns, a six for his\n\noriginal program\n\n<$D>  I think knowing Kurt all he's worried about is what his job\n\nis and I think    he's    going to   go out  \n\nthere and do that job\n\n<$C>  He looked very good on warm-up\n\n\n and then  , pulled off a few triple axels and  \n\n he   looks to have really relaxed,\n He's the first skater out,\n\n<$B>  And we are set\n Canada's top athlete in nineteen ninety\n The two-time world champion, hoping to three-peat, and\n\nalready the Canadian fans are on their feet\n\n<$C>  He will also be opening with his combination triple axel,\n\ntriple toe loop,\n\n<$D>  Another absolutely gorgeous triple axel triple toe loop\n\ncombination,\n\n<$C>  The triple flip is the next crucial, element,\n\n<$D> , the best, I've ever seen him\n\nexecute it,\n Chris, it's always so exciting to see two great competitors,\n\nlike Petrenko and Browning come out here and lay their best cards on the\n\ntable\n This is what great figure skating is all about\n\n<$B>  Aside from what he does on the ice listen to the ovations\n The fans want the sixes, might even want nines, for Kurt\n\nBrowning\n But it's that competitive fire, along with what he does on the\n\nice that I think makes him stand out\n\n<$C>  And Kurt is always, great under pressure\n He really pulled this one off today, skating, right after\n\nPetrenko\n look at the combination\n\n\non the   triple axel,\n Great landing, straight into the triple toe, and another\n\ngreat jump,", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$D>  As you can tell from our replays they're showing a lot of jumps\n\nand that's what these men do better than, anybody else has ever done\n\nbefore\n Here's the triple flip, preceded by the footwork\n Nicely pulled out,\n\n<$B>  but\n\n,  but   they say Petrenko and Browning their jumps really\n\nset them apart from the rest\n\n<$D> \n\n<$D>  Well the thing to notice is how much flow they have coming in\n\ncoming out\n\n<$A>  Here are the marks, technical marks five eights, a five\n\nseven from the Yugoslavian, up to a five nine from the American, judge\n It will be very interesting to see how they're seeded after, this\n\noriginal program\n Now the artistic marks five eights, across the board the\n\nHungarian judge a five nine\n Not enough though, and just like in Halifax, Kurt Browning\n\n<,> is second in the original program and Viktor Petrenko, of the Soviet\n\nUnion will lead, after the original,\n\n<$B>  We've seen the Soviet champion and the Canadian champion\n Here's the American champion Todd Eldredge and he could be a wild\n\ncard in this,   because \n\n<$D> \n\n<$D>  Todd is a technically strong skater but he sometimes lacks the\n\naggression to really put the program over,\n\n<$C>  Had a problem on the landing of the triple axel,\n It was performed but he did touch down with his hand,\n Very nice triple S jump,\n\n<$D> \n\n this combination   spin,\n\n<$D>  Like Petrenko and Browning I like the way Todd goes out there\n\nand interprets his music\n\n\nmovement    throughout   there's never a dull\n\nmoment never a, stray arm, and that's important when you're    going to   get into this league of competition\n\n<$C>  I thought except for the touchdown on the triple axel it was a\n\nvery strong performance, and I think that he   \n\nshould be up   in the top\n\n<$B>  Almost a sense of relief on his face when he was finished\n\n<$D>  I think uhm, his shorts have given some trouble before and\n\n   to   get this under his belt has got to be a real\n\nconfidence booster\n\n<$C>  Here's a look at the triple axel, and a little low on the\n\nlanding but \n\n<$D>  That, hand actually didn't touch down but came within\n\ninches of it\n\n<$B>  Nineteen years of age from South Chatham Massachusetts, the\n\ntwo-time American champion\n The city was especially proud of his, second championship\n\nbecause Christopher Bowman was there and he, still prevailed,\n He was fifth in Halifax and here are the marks for Todd Eldredge\n\n<,> the first set,\n Five fours, five fives five sixes and a five seven from the\n\nHungarian judge,\n And the artistic marks, five eight from the German judge five\n\neight from the Hungarian judge\n Those though are third place marks, for Todd Eldridge, of the\n\nUnited States\n\n\nInterview with Browning \n\n<$B>  Welcome back to the Olympiahalle in Munich\n What a group we have seen, Browning, Eldredge, Bowman to\n\ncome and right in the middle of it is Elvis Stojko, the youngster who will\n\nturn nineteen next week from Richmond Hill and the Mariposa club in Barrie\n\n<,>\n\n<$D>  As Elvis skates I want you to take note of his knees, in\n\nthe landing of his jumps\n There are dancers here who would, just kill to have knees like\n\nElvis Stojko,\n\n<$C>  Beautiful triple lutz,\n That was a nice start for Elvis,\n He's preparing now for his combination which will be a triple axel\n\ndouble toe,\n\n<$D>  An unfortunate miss for Elvis but I think, he's young\n He's, only at his, beginning of his career and I think with\n\nsome experience under his belt those kind of things are  \n\n going to   come to him naturally,\n\n<$C>  this\n\n  year is that he's really improved, on his  \n\n artistry  \n He's really worked hard at it, and now he's got the jumps and\n\nhe's also got the package to go with it,\n\n<$D>  Aside from the difficulty in the jump combination I thought\n\nfor Elvis it was an excellent outing,\n He appeared confident covered good ice and finished strongly\n\n<$C>  I thought all the other jumps he performed were very solid the\n\nprogram was solid, and unfortunately, there will be a deduction for the\n\ntriple axel, and it'll probably be in the area of about a point five\n\ndeduction, so that'll hurt him a little bit,\n Here's a look at that triple axel,\n He gets great height,\n\n<$D>  But it unfortunately looked like he just didn't, prepare to\n\nbreak out of it   soon enough \n\n<$C>  He looked\n\n\n<$C>  He looked over-rotated to me,\n Here's a look at the double axel that he finished with, and\n\nthat was very good and solid, and look at those bent knees\n\n<$B>  Now his breakthrough was last year in Halifax when he was\n\nninth after being eighth the same year at the World Juniors, but he seems\n\nto relish the role of, learning from Kurt Browning pushing Kurt Browning\n\nand, he certainly is the future of Canadian skating\n\n<$D>  Well there's nothing, to make you want to work harder than\n\n   when you   got someone in your own\n\nbackyard, who's the world champion, and it's a real, target to shoot\n\nfor\n\n<$B>  He's taken the positive approach\n Viacheslav Zagorodniuk of the Soviet Union who had trouble today\n\n<,> has been criticized for, relaxing being, number two behind Viktor\n\nPetrenko\n\n<$B>  Now the marks, for Elvis Stojko, and the technical\n\nmarks are low because of the problem\n\n<$D>  Yes I think we see those marks reflect, the missed element\n\n<,> and that's what the short program is all about\n There is no room for error\n\n<$B>  Well the artistic marks should be much better, and here\n\nthey come and they are much better,\n Up to a five five from the Hungarian judge who ranks Elvis fourth\n\n<,>\n Overall he, will be in fifth place Elvis Stojko of Canada,\n Christopher Bowman of the United States is warming up\n He's next when we return to Munich and more of the nineteen\n\nninety-one World Figure Skating Championships \n\n<$B>  The most controversial, perhaps the most talked about\n\nskater here is Christopher Bowman of the United States\n Born in Hollywood, and I guess his story is, potentially a\n\n<,> Hollywood script\n\n<$D>  Well Chris the controversy has come about because of his move\n\nto, training under a fellow Canadian Toller Cranston, and we're    going to   see a really distinct, and different\n\nChristopher Bowman out here today\n\n<$C>  He looked a little bit unsure of himself on the warm-up prior\n\n ,  to   his skate but Christopher always seems\n\nto be one that can, pull it off when it counts,\n Let's see,\n That was a gorgeous triple lutz jump with a triple toe\n It doesn't quite have the difficulty, of the combinations that\n\nKurt and Viktor performed, but it was well done,\n And a very nice triple flip,\n He's on today,\n\n<$D>  Well for Christopher I thought it was an excellent excellent\n\nperformance\n He went out there and really, moved that program out\n That's something he hasn't always done with consistency, but he\n\ncovered a lot of ice especially in his footwork sections, and completed\n\nevery element required to a tee\n\n<$B>  Well it hasn't been easy for Toller Cranston to make him a\n\nmore focused athlete but, boy the discipline showed today\n\n<$C>  You could really see the little Toller touches throughout the\n\nprogram,\n It sure is a different Christopher then we saw last year at Worlds\n\n[ 48:30]\n\n<$B>  Well I mentioned the Hollywood script because erratic is the\n\nbest way to describe, his career\n, Last summer at the Goodwill games he improvised his\n\nwhole program   and,  said he skated like a total fool\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  Here's a look at his triple lutz,\n Very clean,\n Into the triple toe loop,\n Very nice,\n The one thing with Christopher is he doesn't quite have the speed\n\n<,> going into the jumps that Viktor and Kurt seem to have,\n Here's a look at the triple flip,\n Very nice landing\n\n<$D>  He gave a performance that made you sit back and go, that's\n\nthe kind of thing that Christopher Bowman has the potential to do at all\n\ntimes but we haven't always seen it\n\n<$B>  He was a childhood actor, and he has certainly,\n\nthickened the plot here at the World Championships, with the original\n\nprogram,\n And here are the first set of marks, for Christopher Bowman\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C> \n\n a little lower, than, Viktor's and Kurt's and that's because he\n\nperformed, a combination that was less difficult than they did\n\n<$C>  He chose to do the triple lutz instead of the triple axel\n\ncombination\n\n<$D>  We see him sitting there with Ellen Burka who is also a\n\nreknowned, Canadian coach\n\n<$B>  Now the artistic marks, and they too are impressive\n He'll move ahead of his, American counterpart Todd Eldredge and\n\nhe'll be right behind Viktor Petrenko of the Soviet Union, and Kurt\n\nBrowning of Canada\n Christopher Bowman of the United States is third,\n The last of thirty-four skaters, Petr Barna, the\n\nCzechoslovakian champion, and he is a legitimate threat here\n\n<$D>  had the opportunity to see him skate from\n\nthe European Championships and I, understand he was coming off of an\n\ninjury then, and he looked great then and with the additional time to work\n\non that injury I think we  should expect a good performance here\n\nthis afternoon,\n\n<$C>  That was a beautiful combination triple lutz, triple toe\n It doesn't quite have the same difficulty, of Viktor and Kurt's\n\ncombination, but it was a beautiful combination none the less,\n And a gorgeous triple loop,\n He's on today,\n\n<$D>  In watching Petr, I'm impressed by the way he's going out\n\nthere, and he's giving us a performance\n He's not just skating, an original program he's actually out\n\nthere  ,  selling   big time,\n\n<$C>  He has a great ability to interpret the music and I think\n\nwith that, he may even break into the top three here\n He's having a wonderful performance,\n\n<$D>  An outstanding performance from the last skater of today's\n\ncompetition\n be difficult for\n\nthe judges because now they're    going to   have\n\nto remember back, to whether or not, they think this performance is,\n\nbetter equal to or less than that of Christopher Bowman's\n\n<$B>  He has brought the fans to their feet here at the\n\nOlympiahalle,\n Petr Barna of Czechoslovakia and he has just erased the memory of\n\nlast year's original program in Halifax when he was ninth,\n He certainly moved up in the long program to fifth overall but\n\nthis, has erased the memory of that poor performance a year ago\n\n<$C>  Well technically, he's very equal to the program of\n\nChristopher Bowman\n Here's the triple lutz triple toe combination, which is the\n\nsame combination  ,  that   Christopher Bowman\n\nperformed\n\n<$A>  Just a reminder tomorrow night the showdown continues,\n\nwith Kurt Browning Viktor Petrenko and Petr Barna,\n And later this evening Eisler and Brasseur skate for gold in the\n\nPairs' competition,\n\n<$B>  And Barna and Bowman and Eldredge all could impact on, how\n\nthe judges, decide who will be the champion this year because they could\n\ntake marks away from Petrenko, or, Kurt Browning\n\n<$D>  Well I think we're looking at a situation where tomorrow\n\nnight that last group is just    going to   bring\n\nthis house down\n We've just seen some examples of skating today, that, if\n\nthey all skate up to what they've executed today we're in for an excellent\n\nexcellent final\n\n<$B>  He has shown remarkable cool, waiting almost two and a\n\nhalf hours to skate\n\n<$D>  I would like to think that he did not get into this building\n\nuntil this event was at least half over\n\n<$B>  Well here come the, marks for, required elements,\n\nfor Petr Barna\n He has been the Czech champion, since eighty-six and, a five\n\nthree from the Yugoslavian judge but the rest of the marks up to five sevens\n\nbut the crowd not happy with that first set of marks\n\n<$D>  As Barb predicted he has moved ahead of Christopher Bowman\n\ninto third place, and it's just the sort of thing that, he's probably\n\nwished for all his life\n\n<$B>  Here are the second set of marks and there's his six from the\n\nHungarian judge\n\n<$B> \n\njudge   has him five three five three into fifth place but,\n\neveryone else liked him\n\n<$C>", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '8b728d0f-71fa-4f34-8293-589f463c2358', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:50.801986+00:00', 'english_score':

to   play the\n\nin-turn the out-turn or a draw or a hit, so you plan the whole end so why\n\nare you asking your third where you want    to put it\n\n \n\n<$A>  Well Kathy Floyd did not put that one exactly where, Heidi\n\nHanlon, called for,\n Shot stone however, still belongs to New Brunswick\n\n<$B>  There is a chance here for Jodie Sutton if she hits it very\n\nvery thin she could, maybe come

be a remark about the ice that Heidi's taking here\n That it is well over on the edge of the four play, and once you\n\nget over that far Don that rock is liable to run very very straight, as\n\nopposed to taking ice closer to the centre line where it will curl,\n I would not be surprised, depending on if Heidi hits the broom\n\nhere, uh that this rock stays well in the open, and not buried around\n\nthat corner guard,\n She let it go uh, quite a bit inside the broom I thought,\n She's almost at the centre line now,\n\n<$A>  It hung on at the back, to become second shot,\n So New Brunswick lies two,\n\n<$B> \n\nyou know interesting enough she's playing the out-turn now on this takeout\n\nbut the key for Julie here is that she wants to  ,  get\n\n  a little action on her shooter over into this area here, behind\n\n   this uh guard   that's at, the top of\n\nthe twelve foot\n There is a chance for a double,\n to call the rock that\n\nyou're making contact with,\n have to\n\nwatch this rock very very closely coming down the ice to make sure, number\n\none, that she hits the rock, number two that she gets a half of it,\n\nenough to get in behind that guard or make the double,\n\n<$A>  She didn't get the roll and now that rock is fully exposed,\n\nand there's an opportunity for Heidi Hanlon with her final stone at this\n\nthird end to, hit and stick and pick up a pair and take the lead\n\n<$B>  at the very beginning\n\nof this end she   decided to gamble and freeze, to try and score\n\ntwo points\n a wide open hit,\n\nto score twos, so her strategy played off\n\n<$A>  Shot, not, unlike the one she played last night to win\n\nthe, semi-final against Heather Houston, of Thunder Bay\n\n<$B> \n That rock's got a lot of curling to do now it's starting to be a\n\n<,> bit of a move\n hang around for\n\ntwo,\n No,\n score one,\n\n<$A>  So the shooter rolls out of play\n The result is a single point for New Brunswick, on the third end\n or three ends of play, this game\n\nbetween New Brunswick and British Columbia is tied at one  \n\n<$A>  Welcome back to Saskatchewan Place in Saskatoon\n I'm Don Whittman along with Don Duguid and Colleen Jones\n You're watching fourth end action, in the Scott Tournament of\n\nHearts Championship Game involving Heidi Hanlon of New Brunswick and,\n\nJulie Sutton of British Columbia\n This game is tied, at a point a piece,\n B C scoring one in the first the second end was blanked and, New\n\nBrunswick picking up a single point, on end three,\n\n<$C>  Sherri Stewart the second stone for New Brunswick is just a\n\nwonderful wonderful pillar but for years we've been wondering if she ever\n\ndoes talk\n She's very quiet and shy but boy can she curl,\n\n<$A>  She's an experienced competitor\n A junior provincial champion in New Brunswick in nineteen\n\neighty-three and nineteen eighty-four\n She won a provincial women's championship in nineteen eighty-six\n\nwith Grace Donald\n And of course has, competed with Heidi Hanlon in nineteen\n\neighty-nine ninety and ninety-one, at the Tournament of Hearts,\n Julie Sutton indicating to, Melissa Soligo, just how far in\n\nfront of the rings that yellow-handled stone is\n\n<$B>  Well I think maybe uhm, Julie Sutton might look at playing\n\nthe out-turn as opposed to the in-turn\n She's got a lot of room on the right hand side\n She can miss that long guard by a foot foot and a half and maybe\n\nend up buried\n The rock that she's trying to go around belonging to New Brunswick\n\nis only about a foot in front of the house Don, so she has to just, go\n\nby it by a very thin margin to be buried\n\n<$C>  Unfortunately Don it again comes down to ice conditions\n\ndictating the way you have to play\n It won't bend so much on the out-turn and she would've just been in\n\nthe open as she is going to be anyhow\n But uhm, coming down on the out-turn, around that, high\n\ncorner guard,    it   won't bury but the in-turn\n\ntends to bury better,\n\n<$B>  Well if Heidi Hanlon, gets a little bit of a hit and roll\n\non this one to the right-hand side she's    going to \n\n be forced to play the out-turn\n And I think once you get inside the centre Colleen and coming over\n\nthat hog-line, into the house I think it'll move a bit\n\n<$C>  Well it sure didn't for me but I didn't have much luck here\n\nthis week    \n\n<$B> ,\n\n<$A>  A nose hit\n New Brunswick lies one,\n Five and six Colleen was your record\n You got off to a great start, winning your first three\n What happened over the balance of the week\n\n<$C>  Well one thing that happens now in Canadian championships is\n\nyou have pre-determined last rocks    and   uhm \n\n,  we went   our first three straight games with\n\nwins then the next four games we didn't have the advantage of last rock and\n\nwe lost all four\n And women's curling has improved so much it can come down to who\n\nhas last rock and we did lose all those games in the tenth or extra ends\n Competition, this is the best Scott Tournament of Hearts field\n\nthat they've ever had too\n The competition is fantastic\n\n<$A>  B C lies one as that stone delivered by Melissa Soligo,\n\nhangs on for a bite of the twelve\n But she has her, family here from Trail British Columbia\n\nwatching the action,\n\n<$C>  Melissa Soligo has one bad knee that gives her a little bit\n\nof problems from time to time\n After she competed in Kelowna two years ago she went in for an\n\noperation on it and that pretty much tied her up for all of last curling\n\nseason but she's come back so strongly this year from it all,\n\n<$A>  Will Kathy Floyd make contact with that stone,\n Yes,\n\n<$B>  She never layed a brush to it all the way down the ice though\n\nyou know how straight it runs there\n\n\n  she's   a little bit on the outside\n Now we'll see whether Julie, Sutton perseveres and plays the\n\nin-turn and that's exactly what she's doing,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$C>  Sutton after she won the Canadian Junior\n\nChampionship a few years ago spent the following year in Thailand so took a\n\nyear off\n\n<$A>  Not much curling over there\n\n<$C>  Exactly, but she said it was a marvellous\n\nexperience,\n The B C front end has sweeping drills that they practice all year\n\nlong\n They spend thirty minutes, working on their sweeping\n Sweeping down the ice for twenty seconds taking a break for thirty\n\nseconds sweeping again for twenty seconds and they do that for a half hour\n Their sweeping is very strong\n\n<$A>  Well if they want some extra practice I've got an extra long\n\ndriveway at home they can work on,\n\n<$C>  too\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  B C lies one,\n\n<$B>  It's very very deep in the back twelve foot\n The danger here of course is that Heidi Hanlon, uh can ask\n\nKathy Floyd to come down and hopefully, bury behind the guard and keep it\n\nin front of the tee-line, and if she's a little bit heavy she'll slip and\n\nfreeze to the line at the back\n\n<$C>  What she thrown here is a little more than back line\n\n<$B>  Oh yeah,\n She has a lot of weight,\n Oh and it just hangs on at the back,\n\n<$A>  She nudged the red B C stone out of there and the shooter,\n\nhangs for a bite of the twelve foot,", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'cec2594e-4ffe-43d7-8cc3-1e5d757ccaec', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:50.803140+00:00',

{'text': "<$C>  Kathy Floyd you'll hear just whispering\n\n\nand it   and it   might come down to, one of those fine\n\ncalls when a third has to be yelling her lungs out,\n I think Kathy's trying to save it for that moment,\n\n<$B>  Now here's the rock inside the centre line and we'll see if it\n\nmoves,\n It's starting to come off the line now\n It's curling pretty good,\n\n<$A>  It curled too much,\n\n<$C> \n\nthere   like that   during the week,\n\n<$B>  I'm really a little bit surprised Colleen that Julie Sutton\n\nplayed a hit on that back one\n You know she has last rock the corner guards are up,\n Maybe throw one in around the guard as opposed to hitting on one\n\nthat's just biting the back of the twelve foot\n\n<$C>  true\n\nto   form has applied, what I call the KISS strategy all week and\n\nthat's Keep It Simple Sweetheart    and   it has\n\nworked for her\n So she perhaps doesn't want to abandon yet, what has worked so\n\nwell for her\n The other thing is that Julie hasn't thrown that many draws either\n\nso perhaps she doesn't quite have the confidence in draw weight yet,\n\n<$A>  Not only lots of room but lots of weight\n Will it come to rest before, it slides through\n It bumps that stone at the back\n New Brunswick lies two,\n\n<$B>  shot\n\n  I thought Julie Sutton would play uh with Jodie's last rock\n On playing the, come-around corner guard,\n\n<$B>  Good point Julie a bit of backing\n There's a fence,\n This is a classic curling delivery, in my opinion,\n Good extension,\n Look how she, gets right in behind the rock\n Maybe uh her wrist is a little bit high, which I don't like but\n\n<,> she's right in behind the rock all the time,\n Beautiful curling delivery\n\n<$C>  She sure doesn't miss much,\n\n<$B>  No line is right\n She's a way over on the outside of that centre line,\n Okay for Heidi Hanlon of course Don\n The problem is that she comes down here she has to make sure that\n\nshe hits it, either very full, or a little bit to the inside and drive\n\nit out this way\n If she ever hits it, three quarters and drives it over here,\n\nthere's a chance that uh B C may have a chance for two,\n This looks like a fairly simple shot but it's really not,\n\n<$C>  Heidi has a great opportunity here to put some real pressure\n\non British Columbia if she can roll behind and sit three\n\n<$B>  And that's what she trying\n,\n Starting to make a move,\n Oi she's got a good looking shot and it's all in her weight\n Look at this\n Oh what a beautiful curling shot,\n Just absolutely letter perfect\n\n<$A>  And now Julie Sutton is faced with the prospect of drawing the\n\nfour play, with her final stone, to score a point\n\n<$C>  I'm not sure if you can hear poor Kathy Floyd calling those\n\nshots because she's just getting it out\n\n<$B>  Well a great call by Kathy Floyd\n It makes a little bit of a move at the end but look where her\n\nshooter rolls to\n She makes great contact drives the B C rock out, and she rolls\n\nperfectly behind the guard, biting the four foot,\n\n<$C>  Advantage for Julie is that she's throwing the same shot she\n\njust threw\n\n<$B>  Exactly,\n Okay now soon as she lets it go the brushes will get in there,\n\n   and determine   how fast it's going and\n\nshe's got a lot of weight\n\n<$A>  She thinks when she released it that she had more weight than\n\nwith her previous stone,\n\n<$B> \n\nstop in the four foot\n\n<$A>  Is she going to slide through that hole\n Look at that\n\n<$B>  No I don't think so\n It's coming over just enough to make contact\n the back\n\n<$A>  But it's a steal of one, for New Brunswick, on end four\n\n<,>\n So after relinquishing a point on end number one, New Brunswick\n\ncomes back with single points, on ends three and four\n And the score after four ends is New Brunswick two British Columbia\n\none, in the Scott Tournament of Hearts \n\n<$A>  You're watching Sports Weekend's live coverage of the Scott\n\nTournament of Hearts from, Saskatchewan Place, in Saskatoon\n New Brunswick leading British Columbia two one in this championship\n\ngame, as we play the fifth end,\n No stones in play as, New Brunswick second Sherri Stewart,\n\ndelivers her first stone of this fifth end,\n\n<$C>  All the curlers this week recognize the importance of winning\n\nthis championship\n It's being called kind of the three-in-one championship because,\n\nif you win this Scott you go on to the World Championship in Winnipeg and\n\nthen if you finish, in the top six you go on to the Olympic games and then\n\nof course you get to go back as Team Canada next year at the Scott Tournament\n\nof Hearts in Halifax\n So it's a huge year for the winner of this one\n\n<$A>  A major prize, or series of prizes awaiting the winner,\n And I suppose they have all throughout the week, attempted to\n\n<,> put those thoughts, in the background,\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  help but be reminded\n\n<$C> \n\n the   reasons why uhm Heather Houston decided to give it another\n\ngo this year\n She's such a great competitor and uhm, she's always there in the\n\nend,\n\n<$A>  This is a good shot,\n\n<$B>  An excellent excellent curling shot,\n Melissa put that one directly behind the guard in front of the\n\ntee-line\n And the interesting thing here for B C Don is that they're used to\n\nplaying the straight takeout game, because they normally have control of\n\nthe game\n going to\n\n  have to do a bit of gambling so it's    going\n\nto   be interesting, to see how they perform with their shot\n\nmaking\n\n<$C>  What Sherri wants to do here too is, to make sure she,\n\nmisses the professional way\n go by it\n\nall\n She either has to get the guard or get that red rock\n\n<$B> \n Oh she made a good shot\n\n\n playing a very very strong game and you heard Heidi yell alright\n, super curling by Sherri\n\nStewart,\n\n<$C>  And, Ellen Brennan the fifth player for New Brunswick just\n\nyelled out that that was a six pointer referring to the statistics that\n\ncurlers are scored, every shot is worth four points when they're taking uh\n\n<,> stats but when a  shot is super you should score five or six\n At least according to Ellen that was a sixer,\n\n<$A>  We can excuse her for being somewhat prejudiced if she's a\n\nlittle overzealous in her  ,  scoring on, the shot by,\n\nSherri Stewart\n\n<$B> ,\n\n<$A>  And not a bad shot there by Melissa Soligo\n\n<$B>  the good part about it for Melissa is the\n\nfact that, she hit the <unclear> word </unclear> on, so now the\n\nopportunity presents itself if New Brunswick happens to hit and roll out,\n\nthey'll be able to duck one around that guard again and that's the importance\n\n<,> of hitting and staying in that spot,\n Aw maybe a little bit of a miscall on the sweeping by Heidi Hanlon\n\nthere because she was yelling to sweep, and they hit it a little bit too\n\nthin and rolled into the open,\n Communication between, skip and third,\n fall out a bit\n And Julie said, it might,\n Which means you cannot afford to throw this rock outside the broom\n Which obviously Jodie has a bit,\n tweem\n\n  team   because now they can pull one in around, that\n\ncorner guard,\n\n<$C>  Draw weight's been fairly consistent all week except for a\n\ncouple of games but it's been running about twenty-four and a half seconds\n\nwhich is very very slick,\n So that's the amount of time it takes for the ice to travel from\n\nthe hog-line to stop,\n\n<$B>  The rock you mean Colleen\n\n<$C>  That's right and I was just timing that one and it came in at\n\ntwenty-four point seven to the button\n\n<$B>  And that's pretty good\n That's pretty close\n\n<$C>  Very fast,\n\n<$B>  rock, has to\n\nbe removed, if anybody's    going to   score\n\n<,> especially B C\n\n\ntakeout weight, and maybe get a little bit of an inside roll,\n at the end,\n\n<$A>  If anything she rolled just slightly, more into the open\n\n<$B>  Now that was the weight, that Julie Sutton wanted Jodie to\n\nthrow on her first rock\n She threw a little bit too much weight and it floated out and\n\nthat's why she rolled off,\n The nice thing about it for Heidi Hanlon is that Jodie showed her\n\nthe way down the ice,\n Fairly wide open,\n\n\nfor Heidi Hanlon, could prove troublesome for uh Julie Sutton,\n\n rotation on it\n That means at the end it'll really cut,\n\n<$A>  And that rock rolls into the open, in the eight foot,\n\n<$B>  One thing I noticed about Julie Sutton during the week and\n\nnow in this game here, she is very versatile in throwing the in-turn\n\ntakeout or the out-turn takeout depending on where the ice is\n It doesn't make any difference to her,\n\n<$A>  She'd like to take advantage of that long guard,\n Hoping for an inside roll,\n She has last rock advantage on this fifth end,\n She's going to roll too far,\n And now Heidi Hanlon I'm sure will try and take advantage of that\n\nguard\n\n<$B>  Oh no question about it,\n danger\n\nof rolling out and leaving    the   opportunity to\n\nroll it by that guard or to draw it by that guard\n See now that's confidence\n well take it right to\n\nthe four foot\n be in\n\nthe house somewhere\n Just a question of where the brushers can put it,\n will\n\nbring that rock into the four foot\n That's what she's saying,\n Let it go,\n If she's obviously heavy they won't touch it and they haven't,\n I think you're right Heidi,\n Well by\n They never laid a brush to it all the way down the ice and where\n\nis it    going to   stop,\n\n<$A>  It comes to rest at the back of the twelve\n New Brunswick lies one\n\n<$B>  Well the good part about it for uh Heidi Hanlon Don is that\n\nit's behind the guard\n It's in the back of the twelve foot\n force B C to take\n\none,\n\n<$C>  And that was their mission too,\n Make British Columbia take a point\n\n<$B>  Anytime your opponent has last draw and you force them to\n\ntake one you've done your job,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  In other words Kathy you do the work\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  commentary there from\n\nHeidi thinking that she has one rock that, perhaps is curling a little\n\nmore and she referred to Heather\n\n<$C>  Heather throwed those rocks last night Heather Houston,\n\nand in a couple of instances Heathers' seemed to curl quite a bit,\n\n<$B>  Well that's a hard thing to determine because it depends how\n\nyou release them,\n\n\ngoing to   curl a lot more, and if you put it out to the broom,\n\nit's    going to   stay straight\n It's nice draw weight, by Julie Sutton,\n\n<$A>  Right to the button with the final stone of the fifth end for\n\nJulie Stutton, and with that, draw by Sutton this game is now tied at\n\n<,> two ,\n So at the mid-point of this, women's championship at the Scott\n\nTournament of Hearts it's tied at two \n At Saskatchewan Place in Saskatoon after five ends this\n\nchampionship game is tied New Brunswick two British Columbia two", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source':

Jarret Zukiwsky again complaining to the ref\n Uh the good news for the Bears is they've gone four periods and\n\nthe only goal Zukiwsky's scored was a cheesy one,\n\n\n he    going to   break out and start potting\n\n   them   right    and  \n\nleft because uh, he's a prolific goal-scorer and uh the Bears just    got to   keep doing a good job on   \n\nhim   like they have,\n\n<$A> \n\nagainst   Simpson,\n Troy Hjertaas, Trevor Sherban, to defend this, Horn power\n\nplay,\n And Harper has it off the draw at centre ice for Lethbridge\n Over to Kelln\n Now ahead to Reider\n He's squashed by Trevor Sherban and the Bears clear down the ice\n\n<,,>\n\n\nhim   have it,\n\n<$B>  Good hit again\n The Bears' physical presence has been the best all year tonight\n\n<$A>  Here's Harper with it from his own end\n Skates to centre\n Lead pass to Zukiwsky,\n He knocked it down but Simpson got to it and hammered it the\n\nlength,\n A minute ten to go in the Pronghorn power play,\n Here they go\n Kelln ahead to Zukiwsky\n Splits the defence\n Moves in\n Saved\n Masson\n What a nice stop that was,\n made the blocker save\n\n<$B>  And there it was\n Zukiwsky\n uh\n A set play\n A beautiful pass\n Put the deke, all alone\n And there comes Dale Masson\n He's not the best goalie in the league for nothing and uh,\n cos uhm,\n A goal in the last three minutes would get the Pronghorns right\n\nback in this hockey game\n\n<$A>  Beautiful stop off the leading goalscorer in the Canada West\n\nthis year\n And the last three,\n Jarret Zukiwsky,\n like to see a\n\nshowdown between the

one was uh, pretty to watch\n\n<$A>  Esposito against Zukiwsky on the faceoff\n A minute one to go on the power play\n Here's a long blast\n Saved Masson\n A nice glove stop that time off of, Jeremy Riehl\n, Jarret Zukiwsky in there paying the price\n\nin front of the net,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  paying a price but if you're playing to the\n\nreferee every time\n go there\n\nyou're    got to   pay the price and,\n hopefully McCory gets tired of this\n\n\n going to   go to the net every play\n\n<$A>  You don't book a room in a five-star hotel and then,\n\ncomplain cos it costs more than a

{'text': "<$B>  He's third,\n And so, the final standings, after the men's original program\n\nViktor Petrenko of the Soviet Union leads Kurt Browning Petr Barna is third\n\n<,>\n And what a day for the Canadians Elvis Stojko's seventh, Michael\n\nSlipchuk is eighth, \n\n<$B>  Petr Barna brings the men's original program to a spectacular\n\nclose\n The event had everything we expected and, maybe a little bit more\n\n<$C>  Well, the top four finishers this afternoon really made this\n\na very exciting event, and as we all expected the top two finishers,\n\nViktor Petrenko, and Kurt Browning\n Now the judges seemed to prefer, Petrenko's style over Browning's\n\n<,> however that is irrelevant because going into the long program, any\n\none of the top three men can win\n And we all must remember that this is the exact same position Kurt\n\nis sitting in, that he was in last year when he defended his world title\n\n<$B>  Paul Kurt Browning happy with where he stands\n So are the other two Canadians\n\n<$D>  Chris the top four were not the only ones to enjoy outstanding\n\nperformances  today\n Our Canadians Michael Slipchuk and Elvis Stojko also gave,\n\noutstanding performances although they had some minor problems in their\n\noriginal programs, they are sitting in an excellent position going into\n\ntomorrow night's long program, which has all the makings of being a\n\nclassic\n\n<$B>  It certainly does\n We look forward to that\n And when we return we'll have the Pairs Free Skate this evening,\n\nas Eisler and Brasseur skate for gold\n That's when we come back to the nineteen ninety-one World Figure\n\nSkating Championships, from the Olympiahalle, here in Munich \n\n<$B>  And we welcome you back to the Olympiahalle in Munich Germany\n C B C's continuing prime time coverage, of the nineteen\n\nninety-one, World Figure Skating Championships\n And just a reminder still to come this evening, Isabelle\n\nBrasseur and Lloyd Eisler go for gold in the, Pairs competition\n They are the leaders heading into tonight's Pairs free program\n And again that is yet to come in tonight's telecast\n Judging is a very important and I don't have to tell you people\n\nextremely, controversial part of this sport\n To explain more about judging and just how it works in figure\n\nskating, here is one of Canada's international judges Jean Senft \n\n<$B>  Well I certainly don't envy the task of the judges having to\n\ndecide between, Kurt Browning and Viktor Petrenko\n There's such a fine line between the two\n But now let's turn our attention to the Pairs competition,\n\nbecause it could be an historic night for Lloyd Eisler and Isabelle Brasseur\n\n<$C>  Well we're all hoping it'll be a great night for Lloyd and\n\nIsabelle and they are more confident than ever going into this, long\n\nprogram this evening, and I also think that they have the strongest,\n\nprogram here tonight    and   if they hit it, I\n\nthink there's no problem they can win it\n\n<$D>  Chris I thought, the strength of the Pairs event was\n\nevident last night when Christine Hough and Doug Ladret made one mistake,\n\nbut as a result find themselves in tenth place going into this long\n The biggest surprise of the evening was perhaps Stacey Ball and\n\nJean-Michel Bombardier, who put in an excellent outing and as a result\n\nfind themselves in eighth place going into tonight's long program\n\n<$B>  Brasseur and Eisler will skate last tonight\n next thirty seconds\n\nuntranscribed: audio cuts out \n\n<$C>  The next element the side-by-side, triple toe loops,\n\n<$D>  They both have a little bit of trouble on it, but\n\nnevertheless it , doesn't upset the flow of the program too\n\nbadly at all,\n Christine had a problem with the landing of the throw double axle\n I'm surprised\n She usually does that element, perfectly,\n\n<$D>  Chris there's a situation where you're attempting a very\n\ndifficult element at almost the four minute mark of a program\n And I have to wonder if they couldn't have, placed that element\n\na little bit earlier, when they went in a little bit fresher and had a\n\nbetter chance of executing it,\n Barb in watching Christine did you get the feeling that she really\n\nwasn't on top of those throws,\n\n<$C>  I really did Paul but I also think, that this was very\n\ndifficult for them tonight, coming off, such    a\n\n  disappointing short program last night\n It\n\n  It almost reminds me of us   in Sarajevo,\n\n<$B>  Well the Canadian fans throwing flowers on the ice for\n\nChristine Hough and Doug Ladret who are sixth in Halifax they're tenth here\n\nand, certainly will not be able to achieve the same success as last year\n\nat the World Championships\n But she certainly lives up to her nickname Tuffy,\n\n<$D> \n\n  as they have   placed sixth last year, you've\n\ngot a goal of at least attaining that if not something better, and it\n\nreally does tend to take the wind out of your sails when you don't have a\n\nshort program that goes as well as you'd like\n\n<$C>  Here's a look at the throw triple Salchow,\n Christine just looked very far forward on the landing and couldn't\n\nhold it,\n\n<$B>  mention that\n\n<,> last night you mentioned the, comedic, short program\n It went over very big with the British who were raving about it and\n\nI was interested that the British judge marked them so much higher than the\n\nrest\n Obviously it struck a chord with the British sense of humour and\n\ntonight they showed their versatility in another way\n\n<$C>  Well I thought this was a very, nice program\n It suited Doug and Christine a lot\n I just think that, once they get the elements and the program\n\ntogether, they're    going to   have a great\n\npackage\n\n<$B>  They were the national champions in eighty-eight second in\n\nCanada in nineteen ninety, and ninety-one,\n And the first set of marks,\n Low fives, four nine from the German judge four eight, from\n\nthe judge from Japan,\n And now the marks for artistic impression,\n All fives five ones and five twos\n The Japanese judge a four point nine,\n So Christine Hough and Doug Ladret, are currently, in second\n\nplace, trying to stay in the top ten,\n The young Canadians Stacey Ball and Jean-Michel Bombardier are next\n\nwhen we return to the ninety-one World's in Munich, after this \n\n<$B>  Here are our surprising Canadians\n Eighth place Stacey Ball and Jean-Michel Bombardier,\n Just talked to Jean-Michel a few minutes ago and he says he's\n\nnervous\n When they came, they had nothing to lose but all of a sudden\n\nthey're in the top ten and maybe could move up\n\n<$C>  Well they have a very dynamic opening, planned,\n open with a\n\ntriple twist, following it with a throw double axle into side-by-side\n\ndouble axles,\n\n<$D>  Well Barb they hit two of those three big elements\n He seemed to have a little bit of trouble with the double axle of\n\nhis own, but the first two elements were most impressive,\n\n<$C>  The next move they're preparing for is the throw triple\n\nSalchow, and they chose to do a double,\n Because of the fact that this team is very close in height, they\n\nare able to , create some natural, leg lines but I would\n\nlike to see them, actually go home and work a little bit on their unison\n They seem to lose it, at times and they need to be more aware\n\n<,> of where, each other is at all times,\n\n<$D>  As I watch them skate I can't help but notice that they do\n\nhave something going for them which is very important and that's Stacey's,\n\nattitude\n She's out there smiling, having a great time, and it comes\n\nthrough and makes you feel comfortable with the team, and it shows\n\nconfidence\n\n<$C> \n\n surprised to even be here at the World Championships\n I think they put on a great performance for their first World's\n\n<$B>  It really is fun to watch a couple of young skaters emerge\n\nhere and, they really did seem relaxed on the ice despite what Jean-Michel\n\ntold us, before-hand\n\n<$D>  And even with the one mistake one thing you have to remember\n\nthat, one element a program does not make\n I've seen a lot of people win titles and have a mistake and I think\n\nthat's something    all skaters   should remember\n\n<$C>  Cos look at their triple twist,\n A little tight on the landing, but it was landed, very clean\n\n<$B>  Stacey seventeen years of age\n Jean-Michel's twenty,\n\n<$D>  I\n\n  I   have to admit Barb that, trying to do what they're\n\nattempting here is indeed very very difficult\n\n<$C>  It is very difficult\n Stacey had no problem with her double axle,\n\n\nout   of position going into his\n\n<$B>  There's their coach Josée Picard and she seemed\n\ndelighted\n Stacey's still got that smile on her face,\n Of course Josée also coaches Brasseur and Eisler\n Here come the, marks for Ball and Bombardier\n The first set of marks, five twos and five threes\n\n\n seen a little higher\n\n<$D>  I think the reason why we're seeing these marks is because,\n\nsome of their, pair moves, just do not have the difficulty, that\n\nthose above them have\n going to\n\n  come with experience\n\n<$C>  As well I think they need a chance to develop, more as a\n\nteam instead of two individual skaters and I think that will come with time\n\n<$B>  Marks for artistic impression five ones up to five fours,\n And so Stacey Ball and Jean-Michel Bombardier right now, in\n\nthird place,\n Later Eisler and Brasseur skate for gold as C B C's coverage of the\n\nnineteen ninety-one World Figure Skating Championships continues \n\n<$B>  In contention for a medal here from the United States the\n\nAmerican champions\n Fourteen-year-old Natasha Kuchiki, and, Todd Sand a\n\ntwenty-seven-year-old\n They're both from California\n\n<$C>  I think they're probably very surprised to be sitting in\n\nfourth place right now, but, there's no pressure   \n\non   them here\n They can just go for broke,\n They'll be opening with side-by-side double axles,\n\n<$D>  That was interesting Barb in that he had landed the jump and\n\nthen appeared to have the difficulty,\n\n<$C> \n\n bit of a hard time getting around but it was landed,\n That was a nice throw triple loop\n She did touch down on the ice, but it was a landed throw,\n disastrous\n\nshowing at the U S Nationals, and I think they remember that and so\n\nthey're just, going out here and    they're \n\n giving it all they've got,\n\n<$D>  Although this team has not been together very long they are\n\ndeveloping a nice rapport between themselves, and that probably has a lot\n\nto do with their coach John Nicks, who did coach, nineteen seventy-nine\n\nworld champions Tai Babilonia and Randy Gardner,\n\n<$C>  Nice throw triple Salchow and very, late in the program\n\n<,,>\n\n\n be a lot of, distance between the two skaters, on their individual\n\njumps but I think that's, something, that they're  \n\n going to   grow with and something that  ,  they're   \n\ngoing to     learn, over time,\n\n<$D>  I was impressed by the strength with which they finished this\n\nprogram,\n Todd has had a history of back problems which I know has\n\ninterrupted their training, schedules at various points, and a skate\n\nthis strongly I think is a sign of two really determined individuals,\n\n<$B>  Before the competition, and you can see the, Americans\n\nare delighted with the performance of, this pair, he said he felt that\n\nin the near future they might, be ready to contend for medals but I don't\n\nthink he anticipated they'd be this close, this soon,\n\n<$D>  surprise\n\nthat they placed as high as they did after the short\n As you can see he is extremely pleased with the performance and\n\nthey have every right to be,\n Very few mistakes and a nice strong finish,\n I was especially impressed with where they put in that throw\n\ntriple Salchow,\n\n<$C>  Just look at the double

saw our show from Sofia you know their long program, is a\n\nbeautiful one\n\n<$C>  see\n\na real contrast in styles, between this program and Lloyd and Isabelle's\n This is, elegant and beautiful, whereas Lloyd and Isabelle's\n\nwill be powerful and dynamic,\n And they open with two gorgeous side-by-side, triple toe loops\n\n<,,>\n And a beautiful, triple twist\n It doesn't quite have the height of Lloyd and Isabelle's, but it\n\nwas beautiful nonetheless,\n And here's, the throw triple toe,\n This is a very, good opening for them,\n\n<$D>  Barb what really impresses me with this team is that there's\n\nnever a dead spot\n Every step every arm movement flows into the next\n It's like, perpetual motion\n It's, just beautiful to watch it flow across the ice,\n\n<$C>  Nice,\n They are on tonight,\n\n<$D>  Chris you had the opportunity to watch this team at European's\n I sense tonight a much more aggressive, pair of skaters out\n\nthere as though they really want this

absolutely outstanding performance\n This crowd is on its feet,\n They have, come to skate tonight and they've put on a show,\n\nthat is    going to   have to be topped by\n\nIsabelle and Lloyd by one of at least, equal calibre and determination\n\n<$C>  I don't know about you but that ending just gave me the chills\n It was just, beautiful\n\n<$B>  Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev, perhaps the loudest\n\novation we've heard so far,\n\n<$D>  The whole look was just fabulous\n The skaters, it almost looked like they could feel each string\n\nas it was played by the orchestra\n They just worked it for all they had in them,\n\n<$B>  Apparently they don't give out standing ovations in the Soviet\n\nUnion but, this pair earned one at the National Championships this year\n\n<,,>\n Well the long program carries the most weight, so the pressure\n\nwill be on Brasseur and Eisler\n\n<$C>  Here's a look at their double axles,\n Very nice,\n\n<$B>  Marks for technical merit,\n A five seven from the Japanese judge the rest are five eights and\n\nthe crowd is unhappy,\n\n<$D>  Well they have to remember that, the current leaders are\n\nyet to skate, so    judges have   to leave\n\nthemselves some room at the top, if they  skate well enough to\n\nbe awarded first place marks,\n\n<$B>  Here are the second set of marks\n They have to leave room\n They have, but not much\n\n<$B>  at those five nines\n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  Lloyd and Isabelle will have to put on the performance, of\n\ntheir life this evening to beat this performance\n\n<$B>  The Soviets have certainly put the pressure on Brasseur and\n\nEisler\n The Canadians skate in quest of their first world title, when we\n\nreturn to Munich, after this  \n\n<$B>  Well here they are,\n An unlikely union a couple of years ago as their coach Josee Picard\n\nexplained last night,\n Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler, skating for their first\n\nworld title, but they know the task at hand\n\n<$C>  they're\n\n  going to need to perform a very clean performance this evening,\n\n<$B> \n\n going to   be a piece of cake,\n\n<$C>  Look on this side-by-side double axles,\n And they nailed them,\n Great,\n\n<$D>  Barb I thought that was as great an opening as any pair we've\n\nseen here tonight,\n An absolutely gorgeous one arm press star lift,\n And of all the men skating here, watch Lloyd Eisler's feet\n He has by far the cleanest feet of any man skating in this\n\ncompetition,\n\n<$C>  One more very difficult element the throw triple Salchow,\n Beautiful,\n\n<$B>  They're one minute away,\n\n<$D>  Barb I don't know about you but I think I can remember the\n\nfeelings that they're feeling   right now \n\n<$C> \n\n<$C>  I don't think they could have possibly skated any better this\n\nevening,\n\n<$D>  There were moments out there where they just knew they were on\n\nthey knew it was    going to   be a happening and\n\nthey put it down\n\n<$B>  This building has exploded,\n It's in the judges hands now but that looked like a gold medal\n\nskate\n\n<$D>  As that program went along I felt they got more confident\n\nskated stronger and just put on a absolutely outstanding performance\n Probably the best of their lives,\n\n<$B>  Well Lloyd's dad has just, continued the tradition of\n\nsending the hat out onto the ice,\n Number one ranked coming in, and we'll find out if that's the\n\nway they leave,\n\n<$C>  Here's a look at the side-by-side double axles,\n\n Paul, I can't believe we missed this\n Lloyd did a single axle\n\n<$D>  Barb I don't know about you but I'm always so busy watching\n\nIsabelle do her jumps cos she's the one who usually has the  \n\ndifficulty with them \n\n<$C>  sure that\n\neveryone in this arena was watching, Isabelle including us,\n\n<$D>  going to\n\n  make the difference in this program or not but,\n Here we're looking at a split triple twist\n\n\njust can't believe we missed that element,\n\n<$B>  Well there's not much room for error because Mishkutenok and\n\nDmitriev were virtually, perfect\n\n<$C>  And they were also very strong on their individual jumps,\n\nso this could mean the difference\n\n<$B>  You can hear the marks being announced and there they are\n The first set five sevens five eights and one five nine from the\n\nPolish judge,\n This is going to be very close and I'm not sure they have enough\n The artistic marks should be higher,\n Here they are,\n Two five nines the rest are five sevens and five eights\n It's not enough\n\n<$D>  isn't enough marks\n\nthere to put them into first place\n I mean, I don't think that they could've skated any better\n They did an absolutely excellent performance aside from that axle\n\n<,> but I guess maybe that was the difference\n\n<$B>  Well Isabelle not showing any disappointment on her face,\n Oh you wonder about, Lloyd's bad knee\n He will undergo surgery in June to repair the ligaments in his\n\nleft knee\n That, hockey mishap in the, holidays over Christmas,\n It's rather stunning because they ignited this building only to\n\nfinish second\n TV\n\nAdvertisements \n\n<$B>  Welcome back to the Olympiahalle in Munich for the medal\n\npresentation for the Pairs competition\n It was not gold for, Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler of\n\nCanada\n For the seventh consecutive year, a Soviet pair has won the,\n\nWorld Championship\n What a performance by Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev as\n\nthey edge out, Brasseur and Eisler for the gold medal\n And a surprise bronze medal performance by the Americans,\n\nNatasha Kuchiki and Todd Sand\n Olaf Poulsen the president of the International Skating Union,\n\npresenting the gold medals to Mishkutenok and Dmitriev,\n Interesting that Isabelle as soon as she got off the ice and heard\n\nthe marks she said  well we'll get them in Albertville \n She can take some consolation\n Her teammates in Boucherville, Stacey Ball and Jean-Michel\n\nBombardier, did a wonderful job in their first World Championships placing\n\neighth\n Christine Hough and Doug Ladret the other Canadian pair placed\n\neleventh,\n But this day belonged to the Soviets Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur\n\nDmitriev, they are the world champions for nineteen ninety-one \n\n\n\n<$A>  It's tied at two\n So far neither side has been able to score more than a single\n\npoint\n B C getting singles on the first and fifth end\n The second end was blank\n New Brunswick with single points on the third and fourth ends\n\n\n<$A>  Julie Sutton of British Columbia, and, Heidi Hanlon of\n\nNew Brunswick all even after, five ends of play\n Elaine Jackson, the fifth member and coach of the B C team\n\ntalking with the rink,\n And Ellen Brennan, in a similar role with the New Brunswick\n\nchampions,\n Well very shortly we'll see whether the strategy pays off in the\n\nsecond half of this game\n The score after five is two two\n You are watching the Scott Tournament of Hearts live on Sports\n\nWeekend \n\n<$A>  Well Don Duguid through five ends of play here at\n\nSaskatchewan Place in this Scott Tournament of Hearts Final, anything,\n\nyou've seen that might, cause you to think that one side or the other has\n\na bit of an edge\n\n<$B>  Hei\n\n uh  Heidi   Hanlon say uh, you know I always play better\n\nin the back part of the game\n Uh she's curling about eighty-eight percent now and if she gets\n\nany better than that   it's    going to  \n\nbe very difficult  for Julie Sutton\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Well Julie Sutton as we heard in her conversation with Elaine\n\nJackson indicated that she was going to try and play that centre guard game\n\n<$B> \n\nhave to you know\n She struggled with her draw weight a bit, but the last draw

{'text': "<$B>  That's right\n They put all of their weight so that they're not just down one\n\nstraight line so    it's   a little bit offset,\n\nand it, allows them to get their wrist and it's easier on their wrist,\n\nand that, brush gets very very heavy Don\n I tried it when the girls were practicing one afternoon, and it\n\nis very very heavy compared to an ordinary brush,\n\n<$A>  And Jodi Sutton the B C third also uses that, brush when she\n\nthrows a stone\n The others go to the more, conventional straight handled brush\n\nwhen they deliver a rock,\n\n<$B>  Okay now the importance of a lead\n You heard, Julie Sutton, talking with our Colleen Jones that\n\nshe wants to play a tight guard, so this'll be a sign of a good lead\n A tight tight guard,\n Let's see how close she is to making this shot,\n\n<$A> \n\n<,>   was   almost perfectly\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Now that's tight\n word\n\n</unclear>\n Now that's tight enough eh Colleen\n\n<$C> \n hit it\n But she can roll on here,\n\n<$B>  Yeah but maybe a fraction too close to the circles,\n\nbecause it allows New Brunswick maybe to, hit and roll, into the rings\n It changes the whole complexion of the end,\n\n<$A>  Mary Harding gets a nose hit on that B C stone\n We mentioned earlier that she has only been curling for six years\n\n<,>\n She did not take up the sport until she was thirty, and it was\n\nKathy Floyd who convinced her to, participate in the sport of curling,\n\n<$C>  You have to admire uh, Julie Sutton skip of the British\n\nColumbia rink\n Two years ago in Kelowna, she was skipping what was considered\n\nby many to be a dream team with former world champions Pat Sanders, and\n\nGeorgina Hawkes on the team  as well as Melissa Soligo, and,\n\nJulie got off to a little bit of a rough start\n She was bumped down to second stone,\n, a person's confidence\n\nbut she bounced back from that and uh, is just stronger than ever,\n Another thing the B C rink has going for them aside from being\n\nteammates they are such close friends\n Three of them Melissa, and Julie and Jodi all live together so\n\nthere's no escaping each other,\n\n<$A>  Well they certainly do spend a lot of time together,\n About one hundred games, this rink has played this year,\n They won the final in Salmon Arm, when they were one down,\n\nwith last rock coming home they scored two to defeat Kerrylynn Richard, of\n\nKelowna in that final game,\n Mary Harding delivers her stone to the twelve foot,\n New Brunswick lies one,\n That's the stone that, Julie Sutton has asked Melissa Soligo to\n\nremove,\n\n<$B>  Oh she might've missed this one,\n Aw,\n\n<$A>  Not enough to get it out of the rings\n\n<$B>  Don I actually think she touched that corner guard and just\n\n<,> straightened the rock up enough to make contact with that rock at the\n\nback,\n The opportunity now exists for, New Brunswick to, put two\n\nrocks into the house and, two points in this particular point in the game\n\n<,,> is very very large,\n This is the toughest shot in curling Don a draw to the outside,\n\ncos you're going in an area where not too many rocks have been played it's a\n\nlittle bit heavier, and not only that you're going against the circles\n You're running out of, the house to draw to\n Look at that\n That's perfect Don\n That's beautiful curling\n\n<$A>  Sherri Stewart, places that stone in the twelve\n New Brunswick lies two,\n\n<$B>  Don after five ends Sherri Stewart is curling ninety-three\n\npercent,\n Another perfect shot there,\n\n<$A>  Melissa Soligo at eighty-five percent,\n Is she a little inside again,\n Yes she's going to wreck out front, but she does catch a piece\n\n<,> of that shot rock\n She was a little fortunate there\n She wrecked on the guard but caught a piece of that, New\n\nBrunswick stone and was fortunate enough to remove it\n\n<$B>  Well if she hits that rock that guard a little bit thicker she\n\nrolls right out of play, and then New Brunswick  has a free draw\n\nfor it to lie three,\n A little bit of a break but that's part of the game of curling,\n\n<$C>  have\n\ngoing   for you, they are the breaks\n I was talking to, Julie earlier in the week and there were four\n\ngames during the round robin even though she only lost one, but there were\n\nfour other games that she even admits, she could have and perhaps should\n\nhave lost but she got the break in that last end when the other skip would\n\nmiss or,\n\n<$B>  This may be a break for B C,\n\n<$A>  It just slides through the rings,\n And now Julie Sutton can focus her attention on that stone at the\n\nback of the twelve,\n\n<$C>  The Sutton twins were telling me they can remember going uh to\n\nthe curling club as kids with their parents and, they knew they were\n\ntaking the game seriously when their parents, lost in a mixed game and\n\nthey went into the washroom and cried their eyes out for their  losses,\n\n<$A>  Jodi Sutton catches a corner, of that New Brunswick stone\n\nat the back of the twelve,\n Heidi Hanlon is going to persist in keeping the play over on the\n\nright-hand side of that twelve-foot ring\n\n<$B>  Well that's what she wants to do you know and uh, I think\n\nuh Heidi uh feels that the, B C team is really not overpowering them with\n\ntheir great takeout ability, cos they have just touched uh, three rocks\n\n<,>\n And not only that the reason she's playing over there Don that's\n\nwhere she wants to play because she has last rock, but there's a rock just\n\noutside the rings and, that may act as a little bit of a, uh protection\n\nfor her\n Maybe B C will drive it on to that one at the back and that's why\n\nshe's playing over there, as opposed, to playing it in the open side\n\n<,,>\n\n<$A>  Well for that portion of the twelve-foot circle this New\n\nBrunswick team, has weight down perfectly,\n\n<$B>  Now there have been two takeouts down there,\n Both by Melissa Soligo, and they really made a move at the end\n\nDon so I'm sure that's going through Jodi Sutton's mind, that Melissa may\n\nthrow in at, pretty well up the broom and they really curl so she's \n\n  going to   have be very conscious of her weight\n\nhere,\n know the\n\nrock's    going to   curl at the end,\n make sure they don't drive\n\nit on that one at the back,\n\n<$A>  Well she did catch a piece of that stone at the back but,\n\nin the process, removed it, as well as the object stone\n The shooter sits in the twelve\n B C lies one\n\n<$B>  That's a great shot by Jodi Sutton,\n And a good call by Julie Sutton on that rock Don because she has to\n\nhit it at the right angle, to remove that one at the back, which\n\npotentially could've been a danger to    them   as\n\nthe end progressed,\n\n<$A>  Kathy Floyd with a nose hit, who's been a rather prominent\n\nathlete in the province of New Brunswick over the years\n Seven times she has represented the province, in golf\n\ncompetition, four times as a junior golfer, three as an amateur,\n\nrepresentative, and, three times, on a national, softball team\n\n<,>\n\n<$C>  She's a great all-round athlete and it gives her a mental\n\ntoughness from participating in so many sports,\n Used to the pressure,\n\n<$A>  did you\n\nthink they  uh,  do you feel they   favoured the in-turn\n\n\n\n\n\n<$C>  No they were fairly consistent with both turns\n\n<$B>  the\n\n  with the  , outside-in in-turns all the time and B C are\n\nplaying out-turns,\n\n<$C>  Well when it doesn't really matter which turn you take it just\n\ncomes down to personal preference,\n\n<$B>  Or if you have a better release on the in-turn versus the\n\nout-turn,\n\n<$A>  Mental preparation mental toughness, an important part of\n\ncurling competition as well as the actual art of, delivering a stone\n\n<$B>  Well you can't get over-anxious\n You have to be patient, and like uh, Julie says you have to\n\n<,> calm yourself down,\n\n<$A>  Well Kathy Floyd may have laryngitis but Heidi Hanlon has no\n\nproblems   yelling \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  She certainly lets you know whether you're to sweep or not\n\n<,,>\n\n<$C>  uh\n\nlaryngitis, but that's the second hit she's had there that \n\nshe's just gotten out,\n\n<$B>  Well Julie put it, right on the button, in the fifth\n\nend, and we'll see if she can uh put it on the tee-line here, which\n\nis exactly the centre of the sheet\n Runs through the centre, of the rings,\n,\n\n\n but, good draw weight,\n\n<$A>  Well I think the Sutton twins are somewhat relieved that,\n\nthe worst that will happen on this end is that they will give up a single\n\npoint\n In the early stages of this end, it looked as though New\n\nBrunswick with last rock advantage, might pick up two or even more,\n Heidi Hanlon not happy with that shot\n She wanted to roll out,\n She, picks up a single point with last rock on the sixth end\n\n<,,>\n And so the score after six ends is New Brunswick three British\n\nColumbia two\n You are watching the Scott Tournament of Hearts live on Sports\n\nWeekend \n\n<$A>  Neither side has been able to score more than a single point\n\nthrough six ends of play, in this championship game at the Scott\n\nTournament of Hearts\n New Brunswick's Heidi Hanlon, leading Julie Sutton of British\n\nColumbia by a score of three two\n In round robin play B C ten and one, New Brunswick eight and\n\nthree\n New Brunswick with a victory nine seven on an extra end last night\n\n<,> over two-time Canadian champion Heather Houston of Thunder Bay in the\n\nsemi-final,\n\n<$C>  Well it's nice to have the bye straight into the final\n Most curlers would agree that it's uh, great to play that\n\nsemi-final if there's any way that you can be guaranteed to win because\n\nyou're, in a pressure-filled situation, it's a game you've got to win\n\n<,> and you get a chance to play on this sheet of ice again,\n\n<$A>  I think that applies in almost any sport Colleen\n If you were guaranteed success in a semi-final game, rather\n\nthan be inactive for a period of time leading up to a championship, you\n\nwould like to play\n Like to keep, your competitive edges sharp\n\n<$C>  That's right\n Unfortunately there are no guarantees,\n\n<$A>  Melissa Soligo will corner that, yellow-handled New\n\nBrunswick stone rolling it out\n The shooter also rolls out of play,\n\n<$B>  Interesting end here uh for New Brunswick, Don\n There is a corner guard up belonging to British Columbia and they\n\nmay want to utilize it because they have last rock,\n Heidi Hanlon's saying to Julie Sutton okay Julie I don't care\n\nabout that corner guard\n I'm going to put one up on the centre, and you cannot ignore it\n\n\ngoing to   go around it and steal another point, and I'm    going to   have real control of this game\n So, it's a little bit of a cat and mouse game going on here\n\n<,,>\n And as the end progresses, you know that may change a little\n\nbit, but for now Heidi Hanlon's saying to Julie Sutton well I'm    going to   try and steal a point\n I don't care about your corner guards,\n And Julie Sutton of course knows the danger of a centre guard and\n\nshe's running it off\n What she's trying to do now Don, is maybe hit and roll, off\n\nto the corner a bit,\n\n<$A>  You see that Sherri Stewart has, out-performed as far as\n\npercentages go her B C

for Heidi Hanlon\n\nbecause now there is a centre guard and there\'s no question that she\'s \n\n  going to   go around it  , and \n\nthat\'s what she\'s waiting for\n\n<$C> \n\n<$B>  Heidi Hanlon, now going on the attack\n Jodi had to roll her shooter off that centre line and unfortunately\n\nshe didn\'t\n\n\ntake advantage of it,\n\n<$A>  Heidi Hanlon in her first appearance at the Scott Tournament\n\nof Hearts in Lethbridge in nineteen eighty-seven finished with a record of\n\nfour and seven, in nineteen eighty-nine in Kelowna, she finished at\n\nseven and four, and in Ottawa five and six, during round robin play\n\n<$C>  You mean there\'s hope for me for next year\n\n<$A>  You\'ve only been there seven times Colleen,\n\n\n<$C>  I would learn\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A> ,\n\n<$C>  That\'s not quite a disaster for New Brunswick\n She still has her rocks out front\n It poses a little bit of a problem for Julie Sutton\n\n<$B>  I think now uh,\n go\n\nin\n\n<$C>  agree with you\n\nbecause she can\'t clear everything\n\n<$B>  No,\n\n<$C>  Even if she does clear it and make a great double peel and\n\nroll, Heidi\'s    going to   go around one of\n\nthose corners\n\n<$B>  I don\'t know whether she\'d go around the corner but uh there\n\nmay be one around that centre line that hang around after this\n\n<$C>  Well I\'m saying that she makes the double peel and roll and\n\nleaves nothing in the centre,\n\n<$A>  She removed the yellow-handled stone but there is still,\n\nthat centre rock to, hide behind,\n\n<$B>  You know it\'s your third\'s last rock, you\'re one down,\n\nthere\'s four guards up I think maybe you do a bit of a gamble, and uh draw\n\nin around those as opposed to hitting them like Julie Sutton,\n\n<$A>  At the risk of offending all the female curlers who are\n\nlistening today, are not men more inclined to gamble in these situations\n\n<,>\n\n<$B>  I think maybe a little bit but uh you know all week here uh a\n\nlot of the women curlers did a lot of gambling,\n seen\n\nmany strategic errors in this game,\n I mean they\'re almost flawless\n\n<$C>  The strategy has become so improved and it\'s thanks to\n\ntelevision coverage, with wireless mikes being able to listen to the skips\n\nsaying what they are    going to   be doing,\n\n<$B>  There is the odd exception\n Some Nova Scotia teams really have trouble describing\n\n<$C>  Thank you\n\n\n<$B>  Look at this,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A>  the shot she wanted\n\n<$B> , reason I think Julie Sutton should\n\nhave gone in\n It allowed the opportunity, for Heidi Hanlon to put a perfect\n\nrock in there and that\'s exactly what she\'s done\n It\'s in around the guard it\'s in front of the tee-line,\n You cannot have draw to it because it\'s in front of the tee-line\n\nyou have to make contact with it,\n\n<$A>  Aren\'t there times when you\'re in those predicaments, that\n\nyou have to be the first one in\n\n<$B>  Oh sure there is a time that you have to say well okay forget\n\nabout defense let\'s go, and get a little bit of offense into our game and\n\nget around the guards before the other team does,\n I mean Heidi\'s, called a near-perfect game so far,\n But Julie Sutton has a very good shot here\n what she can see\n\nshe may roll over to the left-hand side Don around that corner guard,\n She has to save her shooter,\n Oh boy,\n\n<$A>  So now I think Heidi Hanlon will try and place a stone in\n\nexactly the same position,\n\n<$C>  You know we heard uhm Heidi during the fifth end break saying\n\nshe thought she had a cutter, and you\'ve    got to\n\n  wonder if that yellow rock is cutting a lot harder   uh  than the   red\n\n<$A>  Well she alluded to the fact that she thought Heather Houston\n\nhad a problem with the yellow-handled stones last night,\n\n<$B>  Well for Heidi Hanlon, she has an opportunity now to really\n\nput a    lot of  , pressure on Julie Sutton\n\n<,>\n She would like exactly the same rock maybe, a foot deeper Don to\n\nforce, British Columbia Julie Sutton to make a very difficult draw with\n\nno backing,\n But I think she\'d like to pull this in about another foot deeper\n\ninto the four-foot, but in front of the tee-line\n ever behind it,\n You hear Heidi yelling " just for room ", lot\n\n<,>\n Oh she\'s got a great-looking shot\n Aw this is, just a beautiful-looking shot\n take it into\n\nthe four play\n Tight to the four play,\n Look at that,\n Ah, if you picked it up, put it in your pocket carried it\n\nall the way down the ice that would be the spot to put it,\n\n<$A>  That\'s about as fine a draw as you\'ll see,\n\n<$B>  Now do you remember the fifth end, when Julie Sutton played\n\na draw against one and she put it right on the button,\n That\'s exactly what she\'s trying to duplicate,\n\n<$C>  The only difference is that this time she has to be on the\n\nbutton \n\n\na   little lighter,\n But she\'s remembering that draw same as before,\n\n<$A>  And this is one where the sweepers play such an important role\n\n<$B>  Oh\n\n<$A>  Karri Wilms and Melissa Soligo, on that stone immediately\n\n<$B>  the\n\nrock,\n just keeping it clean\n She has a ton of weight here,\n Oh boy,\n There is nothing to rest against\n She has to stop,\n Aw she just slips to the back twelve-foot,\n\n<$A>  And that enables New Brunswick to steal two, on the seventh\n\nend,\n So New Brunswick has now taken control\n\n\nSports wrap-up show \n\n<$A>  It took seven ends before either side in this Scott Tournament\n\nof Hearts was able to score more than a single point, and it was a steal\n\nof two by Heidi Hanlon of New Brunswick on the seventh end, that has moved\n\nthe New Brunswick champions into a five two lead,\n And right now New Brunswick, is intent on, really hitting\n\neverything in sight,\n And all the stones roll out of the rings,\n\n<$B>  Heidi Hanlon was very busy on that rock\n She was over to the side boards, making sure the one touched\n\nthen she uh had to go back and uh sweep her rock out of play,\n It\'s, hanging on, in the back, but it\'s not, in the\n\nhouse Don and that rock, could prove beneficial to B C as the end\n\nprogresses, but for now B C is    going to  \n\ntry and  , uh  put up some   corner\n\nguards, hoping of course that New Brunswick either hits it on the nose or\n\nmisses it completely\n They have to get something started\n They have to get, a couple of rocks buried, behind corner\n\nguards\n And that\'s the way you score two points,\n The other way of course is of freezing the one that\'s not in the\n\nrings but, just at the back of the house,\n\n<$A>  And very quickly Heidi Hanlon moves out to ask for the\n\nremoval of that B C stone from her second, Sherri Stewart,\n\n<$C> \n\n<$A>  Stewart still curling at eighty-eight\n\npercent,\n\n<$B>  Ah boy when you\'re hot you\'re hot,\n\n<$A>  That stone rolled through and removed that rock that was\n\nhanging at the back out of play in behind the twelve-foot circle,\n\n<$B>  Don you know interesting enough out of the twelve skips,\n\nuh percentage-wise in the round robin uh, playoff Heidi Hanlon was eighth\n\n<,> out of the twelve skips, uh with uh sixty-two percent, whereby\n\nJulie Sutton was number one with seventy-five percent, yet their\n\npercentages are turned around here,\n Heidi Hanlon\'s curling eighty-four, and Julie Sutton\'s only\n\ncurling sixty-three\n\n<$A>  And I should also point out that we\'ve been teasing Colleen\n\nJones a lot this afternoon but she was a solid seventy-one   percent\n\n\n\n<$B> , what\'s the old saying " it\'s\n\nnot my fault "\n\n<$A> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$C> \n\n<$B>  Colleen I thought you curled beautifully\n\n<$C>  Now what do you two fashion connoisseurs think of the new\n\nlook for the uh curlers,\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$C>  Being the fashion police that you are perhaps you\'ve noticed\n\nthat they aren\'t wearing bulky sweaters anymore and, polyester pants\n It\'s a very European look\n\n<$A>  Well in the past at world championships, we have seen the\n\nEuropean rinks show up in this type of, uniform, uh a track suit type\n\nof uh, uniform,\n I think most of the, competitive curlers feel that they are\n\nvery comfortable, but there have been some curling associations that have\n\ncomplained about the, provincial identification that one has associated in\n\nthe past with the colour,\n As a competitor how did you feel about them\n\n<$C>  Oh I liked them\n I thought they were a new fresh look\n They were comfortable to play in,\n British Columbia here they can\'t get too discouraged about being\n\ndown three because you know there\'s still lots of time\n I just hearken back to my round robin game against Heidi\n We were down three playing the tenth end and scored three\n Wound up losing it in an extra end but uhm, scoring three is\n\nnot impossible,\n\n<$A>  And that\'s the task now facing Julie Sutton,\n She, trails by three with three ends remaining,\n\n<$C>  The key for the skip, for British Columbia now is to\n\nremain focused and not to get discouraged, which is a tough thing to do\n\n<$B>  Well especially when you\'re down three points but you\'re\n\nright\n She has to try and score two here\n If she scores two she\'s right back in this game\n This might be a break for her if it hangs in but it,\n\n\ngoing to   spin right out of the rings\n\n<$A>  As you said earlier Don when things are going well, they\n\n<,> just seem to multiply and for, Heidi Hanlon, all three stones roll\n\nout of play\n\n<$B>  Well that\'s right\n If, they hit that a little bit thinner that rock may have\n\nstayed in at the back and uh B C would be drawing for two, but uh\n\neverything seems to be going New Brunswick\'s way right at this \n\npoint\n\n<$C>  You know New Brunswick\'s Heidi Hanlon was telling me earlier\n\nin the week that they have felt like a team of destiny and that they feel\n\nthat these things are almost, as much fate as anything else,\n\n<$A>  laugh\n\n\n\n<$B>  I think\n\n  maybe if uh you reflect back on uhm, this game and if New\n\nBrunswick goes on to win this game I think, Julie Sutton, uh may think\n\nabout that first draw of hers', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'bb4cdf49-f1f9-430b-a5d4-399d289e58de', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:50.811490+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': '<$B>  As opposed to running off the guards maybe I think she\n\nshould\'ve gone in\n I really do\n\n<$A>  Jodi Sutton\'s final\n\nstone she should\'ve asked her to draw in perhaps\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  Yes, I really think\n the shot\n They couldn\'t get rid of all the guards and if they get it in first\n\nit puts a lot of pressure on New Brunswick,\n\n<$A>  That\'s the only stone in play and Heidi Hanlon will attempt to\n\ntake it out of, circulation,\n\n<$C>  Heidi\'s a real favourite among all the curlers\n Two years ago in Kelowna, she won the Sportsmanship Award\n She\'s a wonderful person to play against\n\n\nshe   wants to play her best\n\n<$A>  She got a nose hit on that B C stone,\n Can Julie Sutton take advantage of that long guard,\n\n<$B>  Oh there\'s lots of room\n going to\n\n  put the brush and how much she thinks it\'s   \n\ngoing to   curl in there,\n\n\nwould not   curl in this particular location but\n\n<$C> \n\n<$B> , it\'ll have to break at the end for them\n\nto get by that guard and get it buried,\n playing the uh, kind of\n\nstraight turn\n If you ever get it in around the guard, it makes it very\n\ndifficult for the opponent to take it out,\n They have to throw a little bit more weight,\n\n<$C>  The key too is throwing it to your sweepers and make sure your\n\nsweepers are, having control and being able to keep it all the way\n If you throw it to the tee-line and don\'t allow your sweepers to\n\n<,> be sweeping it it doesn\'t move as well,\n\n<$B>  As soon as she let it go Julie Sutton said tight,\n Oh what a great shot\n Now if they can get it in,\n Ah beautiful brushing by the front end of B C,\n See how close she was to the guard,\n The advantage of brushes in curling\n Going by guards, and playing in the four-foot area,\n Well swept by the front end,\n Well the one thing about it, for Heidi Hanlon if she can\n\nduplicate the same shot, and maybe    not only go \n\n by the corner guard Don, but the one that, Julie Sutton just put\n\nthere and get it in the eight-foot then it is really   \n\ngoing to   be difficult for Julie Sutton to get  there \n\n<unclear> word </unclear>,\n She has a lot of room\n You\'ll see it\'s well still on the line\n got a very dead handle on\n\nthis Don\n There\'s not, much rotation to it so it should move, pretty\n\nquick at the end,\n\n<$A>  She puts it in the back of the eight to become shot,\n Well Julie Sutton can get right back in the game if she can,\n\ncome down that same path, and push back that yellow-handled New Brunswick\n\nstone,\n She will trail by just one,\n\n<$B>  And she played the whole end to get a hit on the nose\n Heidi Hanlon with her first one hit a corner guard on the nose,\n\nand now Julie Sutton\'s    got a   great chance to\n\nget back in this game\n She cannot, afford to throw too much weight on this rock Don,\n run very\n\nstraight,\n She\'s well inside that line,\n Oh she\'s got a great looking shot,\n Oh a beautiful shot by Julie Sutton,\n\n<$A>  So after giving up the steal of two on the seventh end Julie\n\nSutton and her B C champions, come right back on the eighth end\n Two excellent shots by Julie Sutton with her final stones, to\n\npick up a pair\n She had to skin that guard with this rock and out-turn takeout,\n\nand she was on target\n A nose hit on the shot stone to get her deuce,\n So after eight ends of play just one point separates New Brunswick\n\nand British Columbia, and our live coverage will continue in a moment \n\n<$A>  And we will be on hand, next Saturday and Sunday, at the\n\nCopps Coliseum in Hamilton for the semi-final and the final of the Labatt\n\nBrier but right now we\'re watching the, final two ends, of the nineteen\n\nninety-one Scott Tournament of Hearts from Saskatchewan Place, in\n\nSaskatoon\n Five four New Brunswick leads British Columbia,\n Two stones in play, both to the left side of the centre line\n\n<,,>\n\n<$B>  Which is really to the advantage, of Heidi Hanlon of New\n\nBrunswick Don because she has last rock,\n And British Columbia because the rock is fairly close to the centre\n\nare    going to   try and go around it but\n\nunfortunately, Soligo just rubbed the guard\n A little bit of a break by rolling into the rings, but that\n\nchanges the whole complexion of this end Don because now, if New Brunswick\n\nhit and stays, on this rock, British Columbia\'s   \n\ngoing to   have to play a takeout game where they are trying to steal\n\na point to get back in the game\n Cannot afford, Heidi Hanlon to have any rocks in the house,\n So by rubbing that guard has changed the whole complexion of this\n\nend,\n\n<$A>  Sheri Stewart the New Brunswick second is the leading\n\npercentage shooter,\n She\'s at eighty-nine percent,\n Does she get a perfect score on that one\n\n<$B>  Yes,\n The key for British Columbia here now they have to make a play on\n\nthis rock Don\n to get a little bit of\n\nmovement, on the shooter to the left maybe around those guards,\n\n<$A>  There was a point a little earlier as you see the time clocks\n\nin the background where, New Brunswick had used up more time, than\n\nBritish Columbia,\n The situation is now reversed,\n\n<$C>  The time won\'t be a factor\n They both have twenty-four minutes left and that\'s plenty of time\n\n<,,>\n I\'m still waiting for the day and I hope it never happens that a\n\n<,,> team runs out of time and then you forfeit the game,\n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$A>  at the\n\n time \n\n<$C> \n\n<$B>  More importantly, what if they\'re playing the tenth end and\n\nthe other team is up by nine\n\n<$B> \n\n<$A> , contact curling,\n\n<$B>  Anyway by hitting and rolling out there it allows New\n\nBrunswick now to utilize those corner guards Don, and  ,  Heidi   Hanlon\'s decided to go  , \n\nround   the corner guard score two points and maintain that three\n\npoint advantage, that she had in the eighth end,\n\n<$C>  Two point advantage would certainly uh, put Heidi well in\n\ncontrol and in the driver\'s seat\n By the same token she doesn\'t want to get in the situation where\n\nshe\'s forced to take one, although being up two without isn\'t that bad a\n\nsituation uhm,\n You\'d rather have last draw at coming home or be three up,\n\n<$A>  A little deeper than she wanted,\n\n<$B>  Exactly\n That rock is behind the tee-line,\n It allows Julie Sutton, to ask, Jodi to freeze to it,\n\n\nshe couldn\'t do that,\n\n<$A>  You know this B C team is a very physically active team,\n Very, disciplined,\n They, participate in uh weight strength and endurance training\n\nduring the course of the year,\n\n<$A>  And I think from curling teams except maybe at the senior\n\nlevel  , we\'re seeing  more and more of that,\n\n<$B> \n\n<$C>  Yes we certainly are\n It\'s a long long week and you do have to be in, fairly good\n\nshape in order to not get tired by the end of it,\n You do a lot of curling,\n\n<$A>  Jodi Sutton has an excellent shot\n\n<$B>  Aw what a gorgeous what a pretty curling shot that is,\n And that was the danger\n The New Brunswick, rock settling behind the tee-line Don\n If it was in front of the tee-line, British Columbia couldn\'t\n\nhave done that,\n You heard Kathy Floyd yelling " way out there "\n\nand if she\'s got any kind of weight that rock will not move for her,\n Look at it stay on that line,\n\n<$C>  That\'s downtown\n\n<$B>  Yes,\n As they say in curling she has definitely flashed it, meaning\n\nmissing altogether\n\n<$A>  During the course of the week Colleen it seemed that, when\n\nstones got on that centre line with draw attempts, there was just no way\n\nof stopping them\n\n<$C>  That\'s right\n\n\n   wait for it to cross that centre line before you get the\n\nmovement \n\n\n\n<$A>  Well there\'s one thing about it\n They\'re giving New Brunswick lots of opportunities to get around\n\nthe guards, cos there\'s three of them out there,\n The danger here though, is that rock is, over a little bit\n\nmore and they\'re having to take more ice to get around it Don and that might\n\nbe an area, where it runs very very straight,\n And this ice is very sensitive,\n Outside the centre line it\'s liable to run straight\n If you\'re just a fraction heavy, you hit the centre line and\n\nit\'s liable to curl,\n Oh she looked like she threw that one pretty good,\n That\'s right\n well bring it back\n The deeper you take it the more it\'ll bury,\n That\'s a pretty good curling shot,\n She went by the guard by maybe a good six eight inches Don and the\n\nrock did its curling at the end, and it\'s about uh half buried,\n You can see it there,\n Just board weight,\n You do not want to overthrow this rock, in this particular area\n\n<,>\n\n<$A>  Key shot here for the twenty-two year old Sociology student\n\nat the University of Victoria,\n\n<$B>  Boy she\'s close to that guard,\n No she rubbed it,\n\n<$A>  So the end is now set up for New Brunswick, to get a pair\n\nand victory,\n\n<$B>  Now you play it to the open side,\n,\n\n play it   away from those corner guards,\n\n<$A>  This situation, prompts a team meeting for New Brunswick\n\n<,,>\n\n<$B>  Okay,\n\n\ngoing to   go in this area which I think is really dynamite,\n They should put the rock over in this area here and it has to be\n\nin the eight-foot because  ,  if B C comes \n\n down and hits and rolls over here they may not end up shot rock,\n I think this is, a bit of a bad call\n I really do,\n Because if they put it in the top of the twelve-foot and B C hits\n\nand flops behind it, then you\'ve got major major problems\n\n<$C> \n\nfor the double  here\n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  You never, draw to the open house or split the house when\n\nthere\'s a whole bunch of guards on the right-hand side\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  And it looks good for Calgary to advance probably to the\n\nnationals once again\n try to end their\n\n<,> O for seven streak   in Toronto \n\n<$B>  lost\n\nboth their final games against   Manitoba \n\n<$A>  I put\n\nmy money on them   <unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$B> \n\n<$B>  seconds one second it\'s over,\n\n<$B>  The Calgary Dinosaurs, winners here tonight four one,\n\nand winners two nothing in the series, so they advance and the  season comes to an end after a thrilling three game, playoff victory\n\nover Lethbridge last week-end\n\n\nSteve ,   and  would never lead again\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  That\'s it\n That was the killer\n And uh, losing Paul Strand for both games in this series uh,\n\nwasn\'t expected especially when he put on such a show last weekend and, uh\n\nyesterday getting kicked out and today having to leave with uh, what looks\n\nlike serious hip or a charley horse injury\n Uh, ah really tough for the Bears but, nothing to hang their\n\nheads about\n They had a, hell of a year,\n\n\nin the   top four and they\'re easily, the second best team in\n\n<unclear> word or two </unclear> Canada West,\n\n<$B>  Four and one in the

Easy,\n was much more optimistic\n She had How To Succeed Your First Year\n, I'm\n\nuh,\n could do it over again\n\nand,  in reflection    on   the\n\nfirst year of teaching, so ah\n comes\n\ndown to   uh  is   a sharing, uh idea of uh\n\nwhat is a first year of teaching and uh, what it represents the stress it\n\nrepresents and uh  a lot of    uh  the  \n\nworkload that it represents\n And uh my experience, through it and how I went through it,\n\nand,\n There'll probably be things which will be similar for you but it'll\n\nbe, you know probably different as well depending on what your situation's\n\n   going to   be, compared to mine\n this is a very loose kind\n\nof outline, okay and uh, if there's anything that you would like to\n\ntalk about too, you know    you can\n\nask   at any time if you want because, I like to see this as more\n\nof a discussion than, you know a lecture,\n Ah,\n start with after\n\nthe job interview,   uh,  the situation is\n\n  you now have your job, okay\n We're not worried about uh you know how you get a job and your job\n\nsituation\n What I'm talking about is you have a job, okay\n You went to your job interview, er it went well, and now they\n\nsay okay now, we're    going to   give you the\n\nmethod,\n Here's your classroom\n You are a teacher, okay\n And uh, the way I felt about, after I had the job interview\n\n ,  and    ,  I  \n\nwalked out\n At first you feel, very, you know you're very happy that you\n\n have  it, but at the other side you feel like uhm, kind of like\n\nan imposter,\n the\n\njob interview and you talked about you know    what\n\nyou're      going to   do if there's a\n\ndiscipline situation\n\n\n  going to   do  ,  with \n\n the programming\n\n\n teach English and everything, but    you haven't actually   done it yet,\n You know what I mean\n\n\nhave to do it so, \n\n\n kind of a week period in which you start  in  school before you\n\nactually get  ,  into classes   in which\n\nyou have you know,    pedagogical   days  right, you have like about a week of    pedagogical   days, in which  \n\n you're   thinking about this over and over again what are you\n\ngoing to do and, how are you going to deal with it,\n you better know\n\n, ah   you better know   what you're going to\n\ndo, uh, before    you   step into the class\n\nand don't count on these    pedagogical   days\n that\n\nthey're    going to   give you time, okay\n\nafter your job interview\n Don't think they're going to take care of you, in a very big way\n\n<,> okay\n You're on your own in that sense, okay\n found very\n\nvery difficult when I started, teaching, was the amount of meetings was\n\nthe amount of meetings that we had, okay\n You had five days, and they basically had five days of meetings\n\n<,,> okay\n They had no time to actually prepare,\n Because you're walking into a situation in which most teachers,\n\nespecially today in the situation in Quebec most teachers have like, at\n\nleast fifteen years of experience, up till twenty years\n They don't need a week, to prepare their first day of school\n You know they know what they're going to do\n So for them, it's sort of well what are we going to do with this\n\ntime so quite often they have meetings    and  \n\nthey discuss how they're going to, prepare uh the schedule for example or\n\nthey might talk about rules in class and, <unclear> word </unclear> rules\n\nin the school\n Uh they might talk about presence, how we're going to deal with\n\nuh, the papers\n do about\n\nuhm recycling and\n Things that for you, have no you know what are you going to do\n\n on  your first day\n, The most important meeting, which is the meeting in which\n\nyou're    going to   meet the students\n meet the\n\nstudents\n What are you going to say to the students,\n You have to think about that\n That is your priority\n, And what happens, is that when you're going to come in for\n\nafter the job interview and it's your first few days, the first thing\n\nyou're    going to  , realize, is that,\n\nevery school no matter which school you go to, every school has its way of\n\n being  has its political structure\n You have your unions\n You have your different,\n If you go to a big school you'll have different departments,\n\nokay\n If you go into a village you'll have families\n Tremblays\n\n   and you know they have   all the \n\ndépanneurs   and    you know    the       ,  the   Gaudreaux    have the   gas station and they hate the Tremblays and\n a whole\n\nbunch of things that you don't even know when you walk into a situation\n And if you go into a big city like Montreal, there's probably\n\npolitical situations which  \n\n  ,  you   just don't know about  \n\n\nkinda   kind of   see it      as \n\n,  ,  you're   very vulnerable \n Let's put it that way okay\n\n\n\nwanna   want to   bring you onto their side\n somebody let's bring him onto my side,\n\nlet's bring him onto my side\n The principal hey buddy you know,\n You're a good guy\n Be on my side,\n walk into\n\nto  office and oh that guy is such a jerk you know\n have anything to\n\ndo with him you know\n You know we all hate him and you know what he did and\n you're very torn\n\nbetween this\n And then you have the union who come in and go, you know you're\n\na member of the union now  ,  and   things you\n\nhave to deal with\n You have to deal with the union\n So you have many many, uh pressures, that you don't even\n\n<,,> know, how to deal with at first\n I believe you don't really, you should not\n\ndeal with that right away,\n if I if I had\n\nsomething   if I could do   it over again, going into my\n\nfirst day of teaching going into a new school,    I wouldn't   say very much you know\n\n you have all these meetings well\n\n<,> you're    going to   have to prepare, your\n\n<,,> first meeting with your students\n deal with\n\nthose students\n the most\n\nimportant thing,\n Okay what are you going to say to the students when you first meet\n\nthem\n, Because, half of your year, okay, at least, is,\n\ndictated by the first five minutes that you meet the students\n It sounds, uh, exaggerated but it's not, okay\n The impression that you give to your students on the first day of\n\nclasses, is extremely important, okay\n,\n\n we get a lot of   advice,  okay  you won't be missing\n\nany advice,\n strange\n\nadvice so  getting  advice like don't smile,\n Okay when you meet the students don't smile\n Be very strict when you meet the students, okay uh\n, Don't talk to them about, your life\n Don't\n You know you get all these kind of things that you shouldn't do,\n But you don't get very much of what you should do, okay and how\n\n<,> you should meet the students\n And, the thing is is that, when you meet the students, for\n\nthe first time uhm, they don't know who you are, okay, and they\n\ndon't know, that  ,  you know that you have\n\n  no experience as a teacher, okay\n\n\n<,> okay\n They'll find out\n\n  \n find out soon enough,\n\nbut they don't know that yet, okay and so\n And if they do know that you're a new teacher they do know that\n\nyou're a brand new teacher, they don't know if you're a good teacher or a\n\nbad teacher, okay\n these things up,\n They pick these things up very quickly, okay, so,\n But they will know who you are, okay\n Students, will pick up who you are, in a very real sense of\n\nthe meaning, okay\n As a university student, we're very polite\n in distance, and\n\nuh we believe in respecting other people\n primary,\n\nsecondary students, they're going to know, who, you are as a person\n\n<,> and they analyze everything\n They look at you and they pick up everything,\n And things that you never thought about, like that you forgot\n\nabout for years as a university student or, you know they  pick it up like that within a second \n You know things that maybe you hestitate, when you speak\n Maybe you wear glasses\n\n Things you never really thought about all of a sudden ah ha you\n\nwear glasses\n You know yeah okay well\n\n onto that,\n\nyou know,\n So when you meet them for the first time, you have to, make\n\nthem, realize that, you are a teacher\n That's who you are\n, And they are students,\n Okay you are not, uh, their buddy,\n You're not their friend,\n You're not, their parents, you're not their mom or their dad\n\n<,>\n That you're not their uh scapegoat\n push you around\n You're, their teacher\n, Okay so that's what you have to show\n, But, at the same time, you have to know what is a\n\nteacher\n What is your definition of a teacher,\n Because they're saying to you after your job interview you are a\n\nteacher,\n But are you a teacher\n Do you believe that you're a teacher after your job interview,\n\n\n, Do you believe that\n that you're a teacher\n\nafter your job interview\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  How long do you think it takes to be a teacher\n well\n\n ,  from   whatever\n time

{'text': "<$A> \n Uhm, I could probably talk to you for two hours without stopping\n\nabout what's going on at the Cegep \n Uh, what I would like to do is give you some general information\n if you have any questions I think\n\nthe simplest thing is just jump   in if you have a question\n\nsomething's not clear what are you talking about or someone told me that is\n\nthat really true\n Uhh, please the information in here is for you so uh, uh\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> what you want to know about\n step back\n\nbefore August of this uh present school year to what the Cegep was before the\n\nreform hit, and certainly knocked E S L  requirements out of all recognition\n Uhm, roughly before that we probably had about ten percent of the\n\nstudent population taking English courses,\n More in Montreal, uhh less in the uh outlying regions\n That was roughly the clientele\n Some programs had English as uh a compulsory course\n Uh for example language programs\n Computer Science had ahh an English that was compulsory,\n Uhm, Office Management Technology had several English courses uh\n\nbusiness English courses compulsory\n Uh and a certain amount of that some of it depended on,\n\nprovincial, coordination programs\n Others, local Cegeps could decide okay we're going to put\n\nEnglish into this program\n Uhm, aside from that I think maybe seventy-five percent of the\n\nstudents took English as an elective\n\n\nchosen they wanted to be\n Uh with the reform we now have a hundred percent of the student\n\nbody in English courses\n Uh whether they like it or not they're there, and they have to\n\npass two courses before they get    their  \n\ndiploma,\n Some teachers felt that uh this would, create a, a what\n\ndivision excitement whatever in the classroom uhh but from what I've heard I\n\nhaven't heard, very many if any negative comments that these students\n\ndon't want to take English courses\n w\n\n   what's     expected of them, but there's\n\ncertainly no big beef that gee we don't think we should have to learn English\n one view that has not in\n\nfact materialized,\n,\n\ncourses   were before\n There was a description about, ten lines long, uh half a\n\npage wide that described what the course was\n\n\nword </unclear>  mots  général , uhh,\n\nthere was sort of a profile of the student at the end of, these two\n\ncourses will be able to blah blah blah and the rest\n Some teachers were aware of what was in it\n Other teachers weren't\n Uh it was a fairly, wide open field\n Not to say that the job wasn't well done but it was, shall we\n\nsay open to interpretation,\n With the reform there are, more definite standards\n Uhm, how well they're adhered to we'll find out in a couple of\n\nyears once the, proverbial dust settles\n Uh, and to give you an idea of what student now do, uh\n\nstudents in their compulsory courses have, what are called , uh,  cours de formation,\n\ngénérale ,\n commune\n\n, uhh\n Hang on I'll go back here\n complémentaire\n\n , \n So it's in this block where students have to do a certain number of\n\ncourses\n\n\ncomplémentaire   there are, uh three French courses\n\nthere are at the moment two Philosophy courses, two Phys Ed courses and\n\none English course that, all students take and they're mixed up\n And no matter what program they're in they end up in, one of\n\nthese courses\n Okay,\n Ah one new thing with the reform the first two French courses are\n\nfour hours instead of three hours\n\n\nat at   at   four courses\n Uh Philosophy lost a course\n At the moment the Minister is looking, into putting an hour into\n\nthe, first course,\n Uh and at the moment Phys Ed is at two courses although there is a\n\n<,> possibility it may go back up to three\n An there's one English course,\n cours propre\n\n,\n Uhh try to find the definition,\n Uhh sorry there ain't one\n Uhm the Ministry doesn't, really\n Well the Ministry sort of has one\n have dubbed them,\n\n\n I've been have fun with, making up acronyms of things\n E S P they're E\n\nS S P, English for Sort of a Specific   Purpose,  uh because\n\n   they're not   addressed to, a program\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  It's not English for Computer Science English for, Nursing\n\nEnglish for Business Administration\n It's English for, a group of families that the Cegep has put\n\ntogether,\n Okay\n Uh so that's this\n\n\n certainly more sense or it's more obvious than in other courses\n English, French\n\n<,,> and Philosophy  course called  une\n\ncours propre \n Okay\n The other terminology that you may hear, also referred to is,\n\n Block A, Block B, \n\n\n bandied about at the beginning and some of them have stayed, even\n\nthough there is an official term,\n\n So, no matter what program they're in they're all mixed up\n It sort of depends on timetables\n\n\nformation générale commune  and then they have a\n\n une cours prop  uh and each Cegep decides how the families\n\nwill be put together,\n Okay\n formation\n\ngénérale  is  cours complémentaire\n\n and those are the electives\n And with the reform, since English has now moved into the,\n\ncompulsory courses, students cannot take English as an elective,\n Okay\n So students must take two English courses in their regular program\n\nbut    it's   not an optional, course anymore\n electives are divided into five\n\nor, six families uhm, which I don't remember uh but there are things\n\nlike uh Technology and Science uhh Human Science uhh Art, that sort of\n\nthing uhh and Modern Languages\n\n\nla langue seconde  in francophone Cegeps and French and anglophone\n\nCegeps and  langues modernes  is anything, excepting\n\nEnglish and French,\n Okay\n, fall under the electives\n So if it's Spanish or German or Italian or Hebrew or, whatever\n\nelse it happens to be Russian or Yiddish, those are electives and those\n\n<,> are there, but English cannot be chosen as an elective by the student\n\nsince they automatically have two courses to pass,\n\n\nquestion/answer exchange with extra-corpus speaker \n a new program\n\ncoming in uh our Cegep uh Hotel Management, Technology,\n in this\n\n  block  formation générale commune et propre\n\n, plus    the   other element is,\n\n what's called    formation\n\nspécifique  , and that's all their core programs  \n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$A>  So for the hotel people it's uhh uhm I don't know what their\n\ncourses are uh but    in the   Computer Science\n\nprogram for example they have Programming this Programming that and all the\n\nrest of it, and if there's an English course in there, then    it's   obligatory it's not by choice,\n Okay\n And in the Hotel Management in addition to their two courses they\n\nhave three other English courses that are under  cours\n\nspécifique , \n\n<$A> \n\n, I don't know Cepet or something  \n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  pre-université et\n\ntechnique   , instead  of  général\n\net professionel  \n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  of\n\nterminology  \n Terminology has changed\n which in English\n\ntranslates vocational and not professional in fact, uh is now become\n\ntechnical, and what was general is now pre-university \n\npre-université \n So those are the two\n program they're in\n\nthey have to do  , this  and this, \n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  at the\n\nmoment it's three courses, but if Philosophy gains an hour if Phys Ed\n\ngains another course    the electives   go\n\nfrom three down to two \n\n<$A>  Uhm I'll give you the codes for the levels\n Chalk starts\n\nand stops \n There are in fact five levels\n they've\n\ndecided codes   don't mean anything and don't have to mean anything\n\nand they don't mean anything,\n Uhh for example one oh four happens to be lower than one oh one\n\n<,,>\n Okay,\n Uh so there are five levels,\n a reason for it although\n\nit's not that logical and   , it may   change\n Uh, the Ministry first gave a mandate to the Writing Committee\n\nsaying okay we would like two English courses one for   , sort of the hoi polloi   that have sort of done\n\nsomething and that's that and ones who are really advanced, and we said\n\nthat really won't work because there's a big gap in the middle, and\n\nthere's maybe something underneath that too\n Uhh, so they said well just make us two courses and we'll see\n wrote out two courses keeping\n\na bunch of things in the back of our mind, noting there was a hole in the\n\nmiddle and we kept those things to fill in the hole\n So the Ministry then says oh my goodness yes you're right we need\n\nthree courses\n with\n\n<,> uh the request for three courses\n Three courses were created one oh one one oh two one oh three\n Uh and then below this level we said there are a lot of students\n\nthat aren't up to the level of one oh one we need another course or we're\n\ngoing to have, fifty percent of the students doing, make-up courses\n\nthat won't count   , for their   diploma\n Uh and they said oh my goodness I guess you're right again so\n\nwe'll create another course and we have to call it something so the next\n\nnumber is one oh four and in fact it's lower than one oh one,\n Okay\n ensemble un ensemble deux\n\nensemble trois , for the moment this is called  ensemble\n\ntransitoire ,\n as they thought\n &agrave;\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> , \n Okay,\n when the students\n\narrive at the Cegep, uh they are tested by whatever, tools people are\n\nusing\n The perfect or imperfect as they are, they are in fact tested\n\n<,,> and then students are streamed into, one of these four levels or if\n\nthey're very weak, uh will be  put into a

reason they get a credit for it is so that, the Cegep has\n\nthe money to pay the teachers who teach it, uh but they can't count it for\n\n   their, Cegep diploma \n\n \n\n<$A>  Some Cegeps, take the placement test and say okay you're\n\nbelow this level you do the  <unclear> word </unclear> &agrave;\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>  other Cegeps give them a choice hey you\n\nthink you can, handle the one oh four try it if you fail well take it\n\nagain,\n Uhh some of the Cegeps said oh we don't have time to do this we'll\n\njust put them all there sink or swim\n\n\n do this and this or this twice\n\n\nof the reform is that the local Cegeps have more, autonomy than they've\n\nhad in the past, and there're a lot of decisions that local Cegeps can\n\nmake\n\n\nsort of   five different answers that's quite possible, if they're\n\nfrom five different Cegeps\n Each administration does have, a certain amount of latitude\n\n<,,> \n\n<$A>  the\n\nteachers   have three weeks, to, do

{'text': "<$A>  s\n\n   school   teachers   have three weeks, \n\n  to   move the students around\n Uh what we decided this year was to take a writing sample and if\n\nstudents said uhh this course is too hard for me to look at the writing\n\nsample and say oh yes you're right or, oh no sorry you're just trying to\n\nget an easy credit so you're going to stay where you are\n\n\ncan move them around\n\n\ncall for tenders uhh through a program called  <unclear> word\n\n</unclear> , uh which is for research uhh and they have called\n\nfor tenders to create a new placement, tool uhh that will reflect the new\n\nprograms\n Uhh to test this use in maybe half of the new Cegeps at the moment\n\ncalled Tecas  Teste <unclear> three words </unclear> Seconde \n\nuhh was put together in nineteen seventy-four with the understanding that the\n\nMinistry would give us money and we would revamp it and continue it and\n\nfollow it up and make changes\n However uh there has never been any more money and it's, in the\n\nstate it was in nineteen seventy-, six I guess\n around there\n So it's being used\n Uhh it's not the best tool\n It does uhh discriminate reasonably well\n, bits\n\nand pieces to try and make it a little more, uhh, what, precise I\n\nguess\n We're looking at adding some sort of cloze test and then taking the\n\nborderline students, say we cut from one level ah at fifty-nine, well\n\nif they got fifty-five to sixty-five let's look at their cloze test and see\n\n   on\n\nwhich side of the line they should fall  ,\n But again there is no provincial, standard\n\n\nindividual Cegep\n So the Ministry cannot, in a sense impose a provincial\n\nplacement test, unless, the  Fédération des Cegeps\n\n, which is made up of all the  directeurs directeuses des\n\nétudes  says to the Ministry would you please make us a\n\nprovincial test\n No Cegep, has to use, what exists\n They can decide we have our own way and this is the right way and\n\n<,> that's what we're    going to   do\n\n\nstreamlining   those ya and there's a certain amount  \n\n of   freedom moving them around\n Uh for example if students test at this level and they go off\n\nsomewhere for six weeks    or they  \n\ntake a job in Toronto for the summer, uhh they can come back and redo the\n\ntest or say to the teacher hey    I'm   better than\n\nI used to be or  was tested ,\n Okay,\n Uh what's, unfortunately confusing also is that, uh so this\n\nis the highest level uhh students do literature\n\n\nuhh novels the other ahh a novel a play a short story,\n\n\n<$A>  some of those\n So it's quite advanced\n The problem is that the old numbering system also had a one oh\n\nthree and it was always the lowest level\n\n\nhas not been that easy\n Okay\n Uh another I think that happens with the new courses is the old\n\ncourses were built on a vertical scale so that way at the bottom, there\n\nactually was a one oh one one oh two but it was    sort\n\nof   for people that, almost didn't know the alphabet, uhh and\n\n    in certain cases  \n\nin Montreal they didn't give it    for   immigrant\n\nclasses who use a different alphabet\n And that was\n\n Uh otherwise most Cegeps start out at the very lowest thing with\n\n   sort of   like you know  what's your\n\nname \n Tuesday\n Uh no, sorry it's not Tuesday today\n\n That was the one oh three and then it went up one oh four, three\n\noh one three oh two\n There were some odd courses in here\n And then nine oh one\n And students would progress up the scale from one course to another\n\ncourse\n If they had three courses to do or if they chose two or three if\n\nthey passed this they did the next one if they passed this they did the next\n\none, that sort of thing, okay with one oh three being the lowest level\n happened with the reform\n\nis that   , uh, it's not a vertical\n\nmove   the way it used to be,\n at a level and\n\nthey progress and move across to this  Cours Propre ,\n So if they come in at one oh four they do that course and then they\n\nmove on to, a course that is in some way adapted to, a group of\n\nprograms\n Okay\n It's not that they do this course and then this course and then\n\nthis course,\n Okay\n Cours de\n\nformation commune , then they move across\n And I can't even give you a code over here\n Uh why don't we just call it, Block B, and call it B zero\n Which is a bit insulting but, you know\n I'm sorry you're a zero\n Uh the reason it happened is cos once the B one two and three\n\nlevels were established and you create something below it well what else can\n\nyou call it except, zero\n\n\nbut\n\n<$Z> \n Anyhow so the students move from here to there\n Only in exceptional cases and programs where they have several\n\ncourses will they actually perhaps go from here to here and then across,\n\n\n across  Cours Propre \n\n\n<$A>  Uh the Ministry realized that they have spent a lot of money\n\non a few of these copies and got criticized so then they started photocopying\n the Block A\n\ncourses   uhh,    the Ministry\n\nwanted   courses developed, uhh along the lines of\n\ncompetency-based education, uhh where you decide okay the students are to\n\nreach this competency\n These are the various parts of it\n This is how we will judge whether they have reached that competency\n\nand this is what they will do, to get there\n Okay,\n Uhh I see a couple nodding\n That's nice because not everybody thinks it's so nice and nods,\n Uh, so the Ministry, came up with what's called, uh\n\n Une <unclear> word </unclear> de la Compétence \n ensemble un\n\n the, one oh one level here and it says,  communiquer\n\nen anglais avec  des  certains exemples \n So what, does that mean\n Right\n So then it's broken down into four elements, uh of the\n\ncompetency and it goes essentially through the four skills\n\n\ndégagé l'essence du message oral <unclear> a few words\n\n</unclear> deux minutes ,\n dégagé l'essence d'une texte\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> générale <unclear> a few words\n\n</unclear>    sept cent cinquante   mots\n\n,\n\n\n Again reasonably vague but those are the different parts of the\n\ncompetency that will be able to tell us what can this student do with a\n\ncertain amount of, ease\n Then there was standards that are set, and under the standards\n\nthey're called  <unclear> word </unclear> la performance ,\n Okay\n\n\nidéalement de la compétence , and then to decide\n\nwhether they've been reached or not they're  <unclear> word </unclear>\n\ndu performance \n And under that there are certain standards being able to recognize\n\nthis being able to write a certain length, uh with a certain amount of\n\nprecision as to grammar structure verb forms et cetera, uh being able to\n\nspeak on a certain type of topic for a length of time that sort of thing\n\n\n  created  \n\na lot of problems the last column here is called  activité\n\nd'apprentissage  and it became a catch-all\n What didn't fit into, objectives or standards it was sort of oh\n\nwe'll stick it in the last column, and so the column got stuck with a lot\n\nof, very strange things   , that  , have\n\nfrustrated people a lot uh in the classroom\n\n\ncome you've got four verb tenses mentioned\n\n\n   activity     a learning activity \n\n\n Well it's not a learning activity but it had to go in the third\n\ncolumn\n Sorry\n\n\n what we have\n\n\nactivités d'apprentissage  there are in fact, indications\n\nas to for this level, what would be appropriate uhh for form focus or\n\nstructure or grammar or call it what you will that would be appropriate to\n\n<,,> quote unquote master be able to use at that level\n Okay\n It has sent some people at the secondary level into, uhm,\n\nmajor curtain-climbing activities, uhm because    you're teaching grammar   and that's all\n Uh which is not really the case but, anyhow we'll work at it\n\n<,,>\n Uh so the Ministry has come up with that\n you decide to\n For example it says role-play\n roles you decide you want\n\nto have the students do and all the rest of it is up to the teacher to decide\n\n\nlevel gee there's a really good role play would be to have uhh the guys buy\n\nPlayboy and the girls buy Playgirl and look through it and have a discussion\n\non, you know, what the media does with  bodies\n Uh that would work\n\n\n at the cegep level    the   Ministry does not\n\ndictate   these books are acceptable these are not acceptable as they\n\ndo at the secondary and primary level\n So it's really essentially wide open\n books, videos,\n\nwhatever you can get your hands on whatever you create yourself if that's how\n\nyou feel you can move your students to what they're supposed to do, then\n\nuhh    that's   fine \n The teacher has the freedom to choose the textbook he or she wants\n\nto work with, and cegeps\n Again it depends from cegep to cegep,\n to\n\n  buy, teaching resources\n Okay\n videos or textbooks or uh cassettes\n\nwhatever\n Uh I'm not sure how many volumes we have but we have a couple of\n\nhundred volumes in our department that teachers can use for additional\n\nactivities\n Okay\n So you can choose the textbook you want or a group of teachers\n\ndoing a course   , get together and teachers decide\n\n  of these five books uh this new book that came out by so and so is\n\na really great book and so we're going to use it\n Uhh and that's the book they use and then supplement, with\n\nwhatever you want \n, students are\n\nsupposed to buy the books at the co-op  \n cegep has a student co-op\n And so in June our teachers phone the co-op and say okay we want\n\nseven hundred copies of this and three hundred of that and it's there and\n\nstudents buy them,\n You could always have them buy stuff off-, campus\n Montreal it will probably work\n\nreasonably, well\n In Quebec City it doesn't too well\n\n\nsell books to your students\n actually against the law\n\nin cegeps\n there's that\n\n  that   opening is there\n Or if you've decided there are no books that are half as good as\n\nwhat I could do and you want to do your own materials through the whole\n\nsemester    that's a   <unclear> word\n\n</unclear> too\n Okay,\n Maybe I'm worried about the Block B\n I've talked about each cegep can make up their own families\n a\n\n      a     problem uh\n\nbecause there's supposed to be some sort of standardization with the new\n\ncourses uhh, but the Ministry    has   left,\n\nseveral doors open and that's one of them\n For the Block B, there are two things\n A the learning activities, column is blank\n Okay\n Each cegep, uh can write out its own learning activities for\n\nthe Block B courses the  cours propre , the sort of\n\nspecific purpose ones\n Uhm, so what most cegeps are doing is the administration is\n\nsaying okay English department or Language department, come up with some\n\nlearning activities\n And they get presented and explained and then, uhh they're\n\naccepted,", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1c881bbc-15c7-475a-99a3-4283f54c5d74', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:50.816922+00:00', 'english_score':

at\n\nfour different levels a course,\n Theoretically it could be that\n Obviously you would need a cegep of something like probably fifty\n\nthousand students to make it really work out\n\n\n  every cegep   is stuck with the problem of okay how do we\n\nmake it <unclear> word </unclear>\n A it has to be manageable\n You can't end up with having six and seven students in various\n\ngroups\n in\n\n  cegeps\n Some cegeps may have six programs\n Other cegeps,\n We have somewhere around twenty\n Uhh, our problem is double because we have two campuses and the\n\nsame programs are not on the same campuses always\n Uhm, plus you have, programs that have heard, hey gee\n\nwe're going to get an English course just for us\n And then you have to say well I'm sorry there's not a program just\n\nfor you\n We're going to put you with somebody else\n Then you have to decide who goes with, whom\n Uh, not an easy task\n for example\n\nhas gone the route of we will make two, families, one family is\n\npre-university one family is technical\n That's it,\n Okay\n,\n\nas   nothing I suppose\n And they said okay we have enough students we can make two families\n\nin each of the levels\n So they have eight different courses,\n A problem is when you talk to your colleagues uh every cegep has a\n\ndifferent code for that course\n The only, possible way of talking about something in common is\n\nwhat we do is refer to as B zero B one B two B three\n B two level\n\n  to a colleague they know exactly what I'm talking about\n\n\n three courses we've got a D W C and D X E and a D X D all at that level\n\n<,> it would mean nothing\n Cos the first two letters identify the cegep,\n So I don't know what the codes are in Montreal but ours is D X and\n\nD W\n Other cegeps could be T R and T S and B D and B F and who knows\n\nwhat\n you want to compare apples and\n\napples the only way is really to talk about, B zero one two three \n Another example is Office Management, Technology\n\n\n  was   called three oh eight a business English\n\ncourse\n we first started\n\ntalking, they decided okay    we've   got\n\nthese two courses and we'll keep the other three that'll make five\n They need lots of English,\n Uh then I suggested well why don't we give them a whole semester in\n\nEnglish\n That would really help them, although that's not manageable\n Uh and then because Office Management Technology programs in cegeps\n\nare shrinking, because it might end up back at secondary, uhh   , one of the reasons possibly is that, they\n\ndecided   to move some of the English courses out so they could put\n\nmore Office Management Technology courses in which in a way   , uh made sense  \n end result was there used to be three courses\n\nthere are still three courses they're just a little different\n So the students in Office Management Technology at our place now do\n\n<,> this, this, plus the three oh eight\n So it boils down to the same thing\n But they could have decided to keep the other three and add the two\n\n<,,> new courses\n But again it's a local decision\n uh to\n\n  make a proposal and then the cegep to decide\n And each department understandably is sort of jealous of what's\n\nhappening because, if they\n For example in Computer Science if they keep the three seventeen\n\nthat means there's a Computer Science course they can give whereas if they\n\nsort of, oust the three seventeen then they can put in another Computer\n\nScience course\n question/answer\n\nexchange with extra-corpus speaker \n I've heard of one cegep where they're looking at five different\n\nfamilies\n I'm not sure they're going to manage it\n Uhm anyhow\n at\n\nour cegep is that at this level since it's so basic it really doesn't make a\n\nlot of sense to go into anything very specific and we would simply keep one\n\nfamily here\n a\n\ngreat deal of students are at this level we, are keeping one family here\n\nbut certain of the assignments that the students will be given, they will\n\ndo based on the program they are in\n If one of the themes is the environment well then they will deal\n\nwith the environment based on if they're in Mechanical Engineering or,\n\nNursing or whatever they're in\n\n\nthe families is uh the families are   sorry, uhh where they have\n\n  to translate\n\n\n turn out that the text they   end up translating from,\n\nEnglish to French or French to English whichever way they're going, \n\n  that they take on their own text books  \n\nor something like that\n So we feel that at this level without making separate families\n\nbecause we don't have enough students we could still adapt it through what\n\nthey're doing in course\n This level we felt uh was too weak\n And we suggested, two families at this level to start with\n\nsimply, pre-university and technical\n Uh we did a survey of the departments, uhm asking them what they\n\nthought their students needed to do when they left cegep sort of based on the\n\nfour skills, do they have to be able to read or write or listen or talk\n\n<,> uhm, and, compiled\n I was going to say tried to compile\n It's not we just tried\n We did compile it\n It wasn't easy,\n Uhm and came up in fact with two families in the technical, side\n\nof it\n science de\n\nla nature science du <unclear> word </unclear> langues communication \n\n<,,> who are all in one family together\n In fact they may not see each other because uh,\n Because I'll explain why in a second\n On the technical side uh there is one group which is uh Civil\n\nEngineering Mechanical Engineering Electrical Engineering, uhm Industrial\n\nEngineering Computer Science and  Geomatters , uhh partially\n\nbecause it made sense    and   in Computer\n\nScience's case they said that's where they wanted to be\n So fine that gang is going to be together and they will get a\n\ncourse quote unquote adapted to what, they're after\n And then sort of what's left over goes together\n It doesn't make a lot of sense in all cases but it happens to be\n\n  metiers d'art   which are people who are going to be\n\njewellers and sculptors, and, uh I don't know what  lutherie\n\n is in English\n I've never looked it up\n It's people who string violins and things like that\n\n\n uhh   sois  infermier , uhh \n\n<unclear> word </unclear> h&circumflex;telier , uhh \n\ntechnique illustratif et technique de <unclear> word </unclear> au bureau\n\n are going to make one happy little family,\n The only fine thread that joins those people is they all have to\n\nmanage something whether it be office workers or patients or, pieces of\n\nwood, or customers\n are\n\ngoing to end up as self-employed people uh,    in\n\nthat   field\n So that's how our family came up\n\n\nsemester     next year   and uh we'll see how it works\n\nout and, die in the trying or  come out  successful\n there are\n\nfour   there are four   levels, so  \n\n you've got   to get families together then you  \n\n have got to   decide how many levels will you have and the other\n\ncomplication is that there are,  in the\n\ngeneral program four semesters in the technical program six semesters  uhh and it could be    in our case   it could be\n\nin any of those semesters\n chalk\n\nsound starts  the first course there and the second one  there and students in Civil Engineering could have  their first course here and the second \n\none there and the people in nursing  have their\n\nfirst course here and the second  one there\n Uh this also creates a bit of a headache\n\n\n\n one cegep   Garneau in Quebec City made the decision, the only\n\nway to really manage this, is to, put it right at the beginning\n\n\n      it   makes   a certain\n\namount of sense\n Although there are other repercussions that are really not good for\n\nstudents but anyhow\n\n\n in first semester for everybody and the  cours propre\n\n second semester for everybody\n It's much easier to manage\n\n\n  their elective   courses    only in \n\n second year things like that\n what their decision\n\nwas\n That was their route\n Uh our cegep, went through every program and looked at the\n\nprogram and some programs said, there's no way they can do    the English courses   in the first or second\n\nsemesters they're much too busy getting in the program so, put it later\n\n<,,>\n\n\nin    semester     in the third\n\nand fourth semesters  \n Okay\n Or some people said, our students are traditionally weak in\n\nEnglish we would like it in two and four because we know a gang is going to\n\nfail in the second semester they can make it up in the third semester so they\n\nwon't    be behind   in the fourth\n\nsemester\n So but there's all sorts of considerations\n Uhm at our place we're,\n Every cegep I would think had to teach, all of these courses\n\nas of the fall,\n Uhh Garneau is teaching all of these, started as of January\n Uh we're teaching four courses in the Block B to the students who\n\nare in the general side,\n The students in Communications and Languages at our cegep have\n\nother English courses to do    in   the third and\n\nfourth semesters so they had to do it in one and two\n Uh so that's what we're in to at the moment\n\n\nthe  , the   other gang is coming that's, playing on\n\npeople's nerves, to put it mildly,\n Uh what else,\n So locally the cegeps can decide how many families\n Locally the cegeps decide what the learning activities are in\n\nBlock B\n Uh locally cegeps decide where the English courses, go\n cours\n\nde formation spécifique  in the given program\n our place the ones that I think\n\nthat are left are in Languages in Communications, in, uhh Office\n\nManagement Technology and two new programs coming in Hotel Management and,\n\nFood

\n you know deal with\n\nit\n So, these things may happen,\n tell you,\n\nwhat to do for your first day of teaching\n Take it or leave it, okay\n I would do for my first day\n\nof teaching\n First of all, okay, you want to think of an activity,\n\nthat will involve all the students, okay\n And that will not threaten the students, that has the least\n\namount, of interaction as possible\n And that will not, have anything to do, with levels\n, Weak strong\n Cos you don't know what they are now\n They could be a strong group they could be a weak group\n You don't know what you're walking into\n

that I do,\n\nokay\n imagine that\n\nthere's  thirty kids here  okay\n\n\n sounds of\n\nsetting something up \n, Okay\n They walk in,\n Now first of all there's the way you walk in, okay,\n\n\nwhat   what   I believe   , is\n\n  the    bad    way to walk in okay\n\n<$ZJ> \n\n \n\n<$ZJ> \n\n<$A> , Hi\n, Hi\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$A> \n Alright guys\n\n<$A> \n Okay,\n more\n\nsetting up noises for about 10 sec \n\n<$A>  It's okay\n don't want us to hurt your back, okay,\n\n\nlook at everybody <unclear> word </unclear>\n The first thing when you walk into the class you look at everybody\n\n<,,>\n And you just look at them, for a second\n be looking\n\nat you, okay\n That's the first thing to do\n Because you're curious about them and they're curious about you\n So you look at them,\n sound of writing on blackboard\n\n\n\n\nmister Scott  ,\n Now they won't say a word,\n sound of writing\n\non blackboard for thirty seconds \n\n<$A>  I want you, to sit, okay sit, sit, okay sit down\n\nsit, in alphabetical, A B C D, alphabetical, order,\n, S,\n I want you to get up, and sit, in alphabetical order\n And then you, sit down, and you watch them,\n Now they'll start looking around,\n\n\nsee certain students who understand,\n\n\nstart picking out your students who are quite strong, okay, who\n\nunderstand\n find\n\nyour leaders, okay\n go\n\nokay you, you sit down you're  there \n They may speak in French, okay\n If you wanted to, you could really work out the language and\n\nmake them speak in English\n say sit before me,\n\nin the class if you want to, okay\n But I'm talking about just your, crash course okay,\n find out\n\nwho your leaders are\n You just sit down, and you just watch them, okay\n And then when they're sitting down in alphabetical order,\n\nfirst you've accomplished your first activity, okay you have them sitting\n\nin    order  , then you sit down, and you\n\ntake a piece of paper, which, has, little boxes on it, and you\n\nask them each their name, and this is their seating plan\n This is where they're going to sit,\n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n Yeah\n\n<$ZL> \n\n<$A>  High school,\n I'd say primary school too, you know\n I would see it\n But this is definitely high school which I used it in you know\n\n<,,>\n And uh\n\n<$ZL> \n\n<$A>  is that's cooperative learning right\n of\n\ncooperative learning when I thought of that idea,\n\n\nyou   cos you   see them sharing and trying to, you know\n\n<,> work out and  you'd  find out who your leaders are, and you'll\n\nfind out who's a bit stronger,\n You'll find out who's a bit, confused,\n You know what I like\n\n  about this activity is there's no confrontation,\n\n\nmake a seating plan\n whining in\n\nmixture of nonsense mumbling and Quebecois French   \n\n<$A> \n Okay well what's your name uh\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  No I mean there's none of this kind of stuff there's no\n\ninterplaying,\n\n\nidea of them, doing    the   work\n They're doing all the work,\n a place and\n\na face  and  ,  you know   where they\n\nare\n accomplishes something\n what do you do\n our\n\nfirst class right,\n Okay we're still in our first class together,\n You don't have any material, okay we're still in that thing\n\nwhere you don't have any material\n So what do you bring\n You make sure you bring paper with you,\n You know if they don't have a pencil then that means they're\n\npushing it\n You know\n\nmaybe   you should bring  I    don't\n\nknow  \n It depends on your situation you know\n But I didn't have to bring pencils at least but I did have to\n\nbring paper, you know\n\n\n\n<$A>  Take out the paper and what do you do for the first class\n\n<,,>\n\n\n<$ZM> \n\n<$A>  Okay what did you do for your summer\n\n<$ZM>  some laughter\n\n\n\n<$A>  That's good,\n\n<$ZN> \n\n<$A>  Write

\n\n<$A>  That's, good\n It's a very interesting activity\n\n\n\n \n\n<$A>  Okay, now, uhm\n I'll tell you what I would do, okay\n\n<$ZR> \n\n<$A>  it's okay\n I think\n\nit's a   really good idea and maybe I'll try it, you know,\n okay comes down to\n\n this \n We'll do vocabulary, okay\n Why,\n Because your students just came back from the summer, okay\n\n\n secondary five you know I've taught secondary five as well,\n But, they just came back from summer,\n Most of them forget all that they learned, okay\n they\n\n  they   need \n And vocabulary is very very, traditional, okay\n What, the

they're there in\n\nclass\n They know the rules of the game, okay\n\n\n to bring their schoolwork, okay\n They know that in class we write down on paper,\n They know that in class do I write with a

know\n\n, study these words\n They understand that,\n\n<$ZS> \n\n<$A>  Sure,\n\n\nvocabulaire ,\n They understand okay this is the word and I have to study this\n\nword,\n They know these things,\n\n They know a seating plan,\n They know they've had that before, okay,\n So I do vocabulary because it's something that they know,\n And you want to start with something they know,\n You want to gain, their, trust, okay\n Cos when you have the trust of your students, then, you can\n\nhave a great time,\n Then you can start doing very interesting activities\n You can start,\n\n\n going to   do that much for you, you know as a teacher\n know if\n\nyou're a good teacher, or are you a bad teacher,\n you,\n You know they know good teachers they know bad teachers\n They know with this teacher they

what you      want to \n\n look at, is what the students know already,\n could be vocabulary\n Maybe it\'s something else,\n\n\n right away, you know\n before you\n\nstart that book,  you know  , think about\n\nhow you want to teach\n strategy,\n Cos that\'s the most important thing\n How you want to teach\n And think about it hard\n Don\'t trust, you know all this stuff around you\n You have to find out what are you going to do here,\n think I wrote\n\ndown everything I was going to say, okay\n lesson plan was I think\n\nfive pages long, you know\n goes down as time\n\ngoes on\n But it\'s just you know you\'re so much,\n there\'s nothing wrong with that\n don\'t think there\'s anything wrong\n\nwith sitting down and really thinking about it, you know\n\n\nwhat I like about the idea of not having any confrontation, at the\n\nbeginning is, that\'s what helps you   uh,  to \n\n establish a relationship, based on, learning, and not based on\n\na power trip\n\n\ngonna   going to     you\'re   \n\ngoing to    \n Even if you don\'t, uh become very popular\n Even if you don\'t, become the friend of the students or the\n\nmost popular teacher, you are going to have, a long-term, good\n\nteaching relationship, with your students and you\'re  \n\n going to   feel good, in your job, you know if you\'re good\n\nas a teacher\n supposed\n\n  to be doing\n have to\n\ndeal with a lot

{'text': "It's just sort of here it is teach it tough\n Uhm if you know what's going on you can understand it and you can\n\ninterpret it\n I can\n\n  give my teachers information\n\n\nwe'll   this   is what we're supposed to do,\n One of the reasons that the Ministry went towards this we were told is\n\nto move teaching away from being, teachers that are just student-centred\n So that this is what the students are supposed to learn\n sort of the message of these\n\nnew programs\n teachers\n\n    what are the students   supposed to learn what are\n\nthey supposed to do rather than okay I'm a teacher what am I    going to   teach,\n\n\n  who is\n\ndriving   the course rather than well I think uh that this is what uh\n\nI'd like to teach rather than this is what the students need, either once\n\nthey get into university\n the creation of the families,\n\nour questionnaire was for the students in the general the    pre-university   side was okay not what do\n\nyour students need English for in the cegep\n That's not what the courses are for\n Once they get out of the cegep and into university what are they\n\ngoing to do in English\n And at our cegep they said they are going to have to read and they\n\nwill have to listen to things but they won't have to write, and they won't\n\nhave to speak, very much\n Uhh the technical side uh was more varied once they were on the job\n\nmarket they will have to, write letters in English and maybe make   uh  job proposal   contract proposals\n They will have to phone up eight hundred numbers in California and\n\nfigure out what the person is saying about why this machine doesn't work,\n\nuhh that sort of thing\n think we can\n\n<,> come up with some courses that    will   suit\n\ntheir needs \n\n\n will\n\nhave to    read   textbooks in English\n\ndefinitely the resource material and all the rest of it but it would be\n\nuncommon unless they ended up at McGill or Concordia or something that they\n\nwould actually have to write papers or anything in English or that they would\n\nhave to, speak    in   any depth in to anyone in\n\nEnglish\n So that's why the people said when the students get to university yes\n\nthey have to read lots of stuff in English, and they probably have to\n\nmaybe listen to tapes and videos and that, ah or maybe a guest speaker or\n\nsomething but they won't have to produce in English\n\n\nit was   very much, a <unclear> a few words </unclear>,\n\n\n the new courses uh was, and there's been a great discussion as to\n\nwhat the translation of  compétence   \n\n is  \n Is it competency or proficiency or, you know pick a word out of a\n\nhat sort of thing\n come up with an\n\noutline for a course where students would actually be able to do something\n\nwhen they finish the course uh as in be able to speak to someone be able to\n\nwrite something be able to read something as opposed to saying, the\n\nstudents    will   be able to manipulate, six\n\nand a half verb forms in uh, two voices and I don't know what\n\n\n  is   not  is not grammatical accuracy\n That's part of the game\n That's one of the ways we can judge whether the text is acceptable\n\n   but   it's certainly not   \n\nthe   only thing,\n Another pandora's box is evaluation,\n Uhh evaluation\n And again it, is up to each cegep to come up with what is called\n And if you have friends who teach in cegeps, uhh it has either\n\nbeen dealt with and they're now reacting to it or it's going to be changed\n\n<,,> \n\n\nPolitique Institutionnelle,   \n\nd'évaluation   des apprentissages \n each\n\ncegep comes up with their policy for assessing evaluating learning,\n Uh and as a further step to that the cegep comes up with one and then\n\neach department can add things to it that they feel are specific particular\n\nto their own department\n students must attend all their\n\nclasses but    could   miss up to seven hours\n\n and that's okay\n Our cegep has a, different policy, uhh which a lot of us don't\n\nappreciate but anyhow it says what it says\n students are not obliged to attend classes\n\n\n Uh it seems like a weird way to put it but anyhow that's what it says\n and they write\n\nout a list of things as sort of this is how we evaluate students\n Uh and it could be things like, there must be at least three tests\n\nthrough the semester uh no test can count for more than forty marks or thirty\n\nmarks    or   whatever\n goes through, the whole list of\n\nwhat you can and cannot do and how students are evaluated\n Obviously with this change uh in courses by competency, this has\n\nto be redrafted\n Some cegeps have done it\n Ours is in the process of doing it,\n Chalk on the blackboard noise\n\n,   , it's pass-fail but it's not\n\npass-fail  \n That's about what they said\n What they've said is the course description here if a student,\n\ndoes that, they've met the objectives, a pass mark is sixty that gives\n\nthem a sixty,\n Not if they've done sixty percent of what's there but if they do\n\nwhat's there, that's acceptable that's sixty\n And then the Ministry said okay, we've done our work the other\n\nforty marks, go ahead\n Each cegep whatever\n So uhh it should be interesting\n have to come\n\nup   with some sort of policy as to, okay now how are we going to\n\ndo this\n Uh the students have reached the competency, uhh so they get sixty\n\npercent, but what if they reach three levels and not the fourth on can we\n\nstill pass them\n Uh or what if they don't get quite all of it uh do we still give them\n\nsixty\n Uhm and these other forty marks is it for term work that they get the\n\nforty marks, or is it because they do more than is expected here on the\n\nfinal exam and it's only the final exam that counts,\n Uhm, in the past if students fail in the sense that there were X\n\nexams and you totalled the marks and they got fifty-five they failed\n That's it\n Sorry\n You cannot come and wash my car and buy me chocolates and take me out\n\nfor dinner and redo    your   composition which\n\nwas garbage\n Sorry you got fifty-five that's it\n It stops there\n With the reform and the competency-based curriculum,\n\ntheoretically if the student misses it they have another chance to do it\n The problem is so when's the other chance\n If you test them on the fifteenth of December and they don't have it\n\n<,> then what's the process for letting them do it again before they have to\n\nstart another course on January seventeenth,\n Uhh to all these questions there is no clear answer at the moment\n\n<,,>\n is trying to\n\ncome to terms with okay so what do we do with the forty marks    that   we have control over\n Uhh based on the competency, theory you wouldn't sort of give them\n\nfive marks for a bunch of homework they do every second week\n - based\n\n  competency-based   program\n word\n\n</unclear> every semester\n Uhh it could be bonus marks on the final\n You write a composition it's, as described here you've got it if\n\nit's even better than here I'll give you five extra marks\n that local\n\ndepartments   are grappling with,\n came\n\nout in a cegep is, say for example you    give them four exams   during the semester and we\n\nhave this student who    he's just passing gets  \n\nsix on each, exam\n\n\n<,,>\n For the semester's work right\n And they have a final exam based on the competency and they write and\n\nthey speak and they do all the rest of it, and, they do it fine so they\n\nget sixty percent\n Right\n either get nothing or they they\n\nget it\n So they get sixty percent for that,\n average student ends up with a\n\nmark of,  eighty-four, uhm, \n\n\n<$Z> \n the problem with, what\n\nwe ended up with\n If they do this they get sixty\n Figure out the other forty\n In the meantime university was saying, well so what exactly\n\ndoes a mark mean now\n\n the\n\n  law    for the reform  , the\n\nMinistry has said that it can impose if it wishes, what's called uh\n\n une examen uniforme  read provincial exam  \n\n in any   of the four, uh, disciplines in  formation\n\ngénérale  which means French English Philosophy or Phys\n\nEd\n So if the Ministry decided it wanted to have a common, English\n\nexam across the province, they could do it\n Uh same for Philosophy for Phys Ed\n They have already announced that there will be a common, exam\n\nfor French, uh or for in English in the case of English language cegeps\n et\n\nlittérature \n That means mother tongue, okay\n for example our cegep we know\n\nthere is going to be a French exam common across the province\n by\n\nthe   by a   year\n I think next year cegeps can do it if they want to, but it\n\ndoesn't have to be done, but I think it's the year after that all the\n\nstudents have to do it and   , uhm,\n\nthey will have to pass that    to   get    their   dip    \n\n<$ZA> \n At the moment no\n Uh the only reason I think they would move is if they see a major\n\nvariation and there are cegeps doing this   and there are cegeps doing\n\nthat  then they're going to say okay everybody, let's, come\n\ntogether\n\n<$ZA> \n At the moment no\n haven't even heard anything\n So I would be surprised\n\n<$ZB> \n No cos it's not that there's an emphasis on it\n All four are there\n Uh if you speak to anyone across the province I'm sure they'll\n\ntell you, there's too much work in all these courses, rather than the\n\nopposite\n That's the major cry\n It's how can we possibly get through all of this stuff in\n\nforty-five hours \n Uh, the other thing is that it's not that\n\n\n at this level okay it's not   ,    that   each   one's worth twenty-five percent\n They're all worth everything, as described\n Okay\n i\n\n   general meaning of the main ideas   of a text of about\n\n<,> five hundred words\n They don't have to go any further than that\n So if they can do that, they've got it\n\n\n  of   the competency they've got that that that and\n\nthat they get sixty \n It's not that this is twenty-five twenty-five twenty-five\n\ntwenty-five\n\n\n  of a   percentage to any of the, things\n sort of, get it all or\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n Okay\n certainly not\n\n<,> any more    uh emphasis   placed \n\n  on the comprehension  , uh\n Actually there's more on the production\n There's much more\n Uh, the standard is more defined and more demanding under\n\nproduction than    it is   under, the\n\ncomprehension skills certainly at the lower levels \n Ya\n\n<$ZC> \n\nquestion continues after interruption \n\n\naudience laughs ,\n\n No\n\n Uhh at our cegep we hired seven new people last year uh and\n\nactually four of them moved from Montreal to <unclear> word </unclear>\n Uhm this year we're looking at hiring and some of them have\n\nalready been identified through the uh interview process last year\n We're looking to probably hiring around twelve for the fall uh and\n\nseven of those twelve    will have\n\njobs for the full year  \n Five at the moment seem to be only for the fall semester,\n Uh, and for example when I mentioned at Berbeau in Quebec City\n\nthey did all their hiring last year cos

strange thing that I didn't know uh at all\n\nsince I've been    in this   system for a long\n\ntime is that    when      these seven new people   we hired went down to\n\nHuman Resources and got their experience evaluated so   \n\nthey   could get paid according to the scale, it turns out that\n\nthat year of eighty-four, eighty-three whatever it was when the,\n\nMinistry of Education did, dirty things to teachers   \n\nand   uh\n One of the effects of that law in addition to cutting salaries\n\npermanently by twenty percent uh and things was that nobody who teaches in a\n\ncegep gets experience for that year,\n They don't care if you taught, seventy-five hundred hours at\n\nMcGill, uh that year does not exist, for experience at cegep,\n\napparently\n There you are\n Uh I can't tell you what the salary scale is because I don't know\n\nit by heart\n anybody who\n\nworks in a cegep\n They have a copy of the collective agreement\n The salary scale is in there, and it's the same for everybody\n\nacross the province\n There's no\n Except, uh there are a couple of cegeps that get extra money\n\nbecause they live, at the end of the world or, work on boats or things\n\nlike that\n But uh, generally the scale is there\n It's based on two things\n\n\n<,,> as judged by the Ministry of Education\n Uh, they misjudged me but they don't believe it\n Uhm, and then by your years of experience\n across the top\n\nokay we recognize seventeen years of schooling and you have eight years\n\nrecognized of experience, that's how much you get paid \n\n<$ZG> \n\n<$A>  Uhm\n\n<$ZG> \n\n<$A> \n The only thing that counts differently is, what they call,\n\n expérience professionnel \n For example if you taught a Business English course at McGill or\n\nin a cegep or, somewhere where a student's got a credit for it, and\n\nyour friend taught exactly the same course you both used the same materials\n\nand they taught it, uh somewhere else where it wasn't credited as a course\n\n<,> it would take them like about five times more of those hours, to get\n\nthe same experience credited as you would\n two levels of\n\nexperience\n Actual teaching, credited courses counts for a lot more than\n\ncourses you may have done under other circumstances\n But they have this whole, file\n gotta\n\n  got to   go through it \n\n<$ZH> \n\n<$A>  uh French\n\nlanguage   explanation of what you did,\n Okay\n\n\n  they will   simply say how many hours under\n\nwhat circumstances was it credited\n\n<$ZH> \n No not that it's good but did you teach it to students who got a\n\ncredit for taking it,\n That's where the game, is played\n Okay\n\n<$ZH> \n\n<$A>  Ya by ya,\n Okay\n Uh\n\n<$ZI> \n\n<$A>  Okay and they presumed that since it's at a university it's\n\ncredited\n\n<$ZI> \n\n<$A> \n Alright the only reason I'm saying is cos I know at our school\n\nthere are two teachers who have been teaching for ten years, in different\n\ncircumstances and one person got something like five years recognized and the\n\nother person got four,\n\n\n  seldom happens but this year   \n\nsomething strange  \n Because we hired seven people at exactly the same time we have\n\nseven people who are on the same footing for what's called \n\nancienneté , for their seniority\n So uh now things will start playing oh you got six point four five\n\neight and I've got six point three nine seven so you're ahead of me for\n\nwhatever that means\n\n\n you get to choose your courses before I do\n In some cases it may mean, you\n Anyhow, whatever it may mean\n four or five words\n\nmumbled </unclear>, in some point in your life <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\n\n<$ZJ> \n\n<$A> \n Uh the selection committees, uhh, are\n In the collective agreement, uh there are five people in the\n\nselection committee\n but\n\n  uh, but   you will be in most cases\n The five people in the selection committee are, three teachers\n\n<,> uhh\n So in our case it's department head which is me and two other\n\nteachers, uh and then there are two people\n Directeur des\n\nétudes ,\n Okay\n\n\n that read through them\n So essentially if you're sending it to a French language,\n\ninstitution uh it might make more sense in French because, there are some\n\nof them that may not read English, that well  to look at it  \n\n<$ZK> \n\n\n<$A>  I've said this\n\ntoo   many times   but it's a local decision\n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A>  Uhm at our cegep what we decided to do, once we got\n\nthrough    the C Vs   last we ended up with a\n\nlist of ninety people uhh and we invited the ninety people to come for tests\n There was a written test in French\n one two\n\n<,,> three, sections of a written, assessment in English and there\n\nwas an, oral assessment in

that course uh, extra courses I don't know\n\n what  read this read that\n Uh it's not very clear,\n and what was even more interesting is\n\nthat   originally what we heard was it'd be based on the \n\nformation specifique  the real program courses but apparently no it's\n\nalso to include  formation générale , English\n\nPhilosophy French and Phys Ed\n\n\n<$ZN> \n\n<$A>  No\n because it's\n\nevaluation is going to be local\n\n<$ZN> \n\n<$A> \n a\n\nteam of two people in our cegep going around, or thinking about this\n\nrather and they've come to see me once, and sort of well, you know this\n\nis what we're thinking about    how   do we\n\npossibly do, this idea of a comprehensive exam on the program and also\n\nthrow in English French Philosophy and Phys Ed\n Uhm, anyhow\n somewhere in the offing\n\nalso,\n So if you talk to teachers across the cegep level you may find some\n\nthat think, this is great    it's a   good\n\ntime to rethink what we've been doing it's a wonderful challenge I can create\n\nnew things\n pet\n\n itself\n people who\n\nare very frustrated very angry in some cases\n I'm sure everyone is very tired\n Uhm, there are problems uh\n It's a holiday of change\n deal with change\n Do you see it as a positive force or is it oh change was there a\n\nchange\n I mean I had to do something different with my courses this year\n Uh and there are people who say change, no change not me\n very intersting\n\nchallenge,\n\n\nsend in your   C V    \n\n \n there are certainly jobs out\n\nthere   but it's really a matter of finding the right person in the\n\ncegep finding out    what's going on  \n\nand what the procedure is and what the deadline is\n Okay\n Applause, M C closes the session and draws\n\nattention to an upcoming event \n\n<$A> \n\n in the evening on Wednesday\n I think it's seven seven thirty\n And then in the evening uh, the, person who is in charge of E\n\nS L at the cegep level in the Ministry Bruce Wallace will be speaking and\n\ngiving an update as to what's going on,\n Uh the provincial coordinator for E S L at the cegep level is Paul\n\nFournier who teaches at Henri <unclear> word </unclear> uh in Montreal will\n\nalso, give an update,\n Uhh on Thursday there are workshops in the morning\n There are people coming I believe from University of Ottawa, uhh\n\nessentially on evaluation\n\n\nto    do   re-evaluation  \n There's one on oral evaluation\n I forget the third one\n is\n\nsomething like fifty dollars if you're a member of Speak, if it's before\n\nMarch twenty-fourth which it isn't\n But uh anyhow,\n Uh, in the price of it breakfast there's a continental breakfast\n\nand lunch is included\n Uh there's a wine and cheese at the end\n In the afternoon there are workshops\n Uh a lot of them based on multimedia\n uh there's a commercial\n\npresentation   on some  authoring  programs\n I've been helping with them\n\n\nspeaking about   ah uh using internet\n Uh there are people talking about how to, create and use a\n\nmultimedia lab\n Uh and there are a couple more\n Those are the afternoon sessions\n\n<$ZO> \n\n\n phone the Speak office  \n\n\n\n<$A>  These galleries are in chronological order\n So it goes, from the oldest art in this room\n Uh in fact this is the oldest painting on the wall uh right here\n Saint Catherine of Alexandria\n It was made in thirteen twenty\n\n\n perimeter   of a large rectangle then we follow ah more or less\n\nthis chronological history of art\n So we go from the oldest gradually to the newer around the other\n\nside\n So what I thought we'd do is start in the second room ah with a\n\nmid-fifteenth century work by uh Hans Memling\n\n So this is a painting by uh Hans Memling\n It was made for fourteen ninety-two\n If you look later on you'll actually see the date inscribed in the\n\npainting itself\n have to remember that when\n\nwe're looking at a painting that is five hundred years old uh of course,\n\nthis painting was not made for us and uh it certainly was not made for an art\n\ngallery\n Mostly cos that concept didn't exist a place to come in and just\n\nlook at works of art\n Uh and it certainly didn't have a label beside it, giving us,\n\nall kinds of information\n So instead for the mostly illiterate people of the time they would\n\nhave been able to look at this painting\n I know there's writing on the frame\n But, just by looking at the painting itself they would have been\n\nable to understand certain things\n In particular they would have realized that the man who is kneeling\n\nis also the person who's paid for this painting to be made\n Can you tell me what detail about him, would have let us know\n\nthat he's paid for the painting \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A> \n Can you see, what he has around his waist\n\n\nkind of purse or a bag hanging from his, ehm waist,\n\n\n you see the purse is in fact open\n\n\ninside \n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  Why not\n\n<$ZB> \n That's right cos he paid for the painting\n So it's very clear\n This is typical of the Renaissance where uh we see these images\n\nthat are really quite close to everybody's, daily lives\n So every object is there because it, has, a specific meaning\n He's being presented by his patron saint who is Saint Anthony\n\nAbbot uhm the bearded man\n Can you see what objects he has with him\n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  Pardon me\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A> \n Can you see the pig, or the wild boar\n\n<$ZE> \n\n<$A>  And a bell\n Exactly,\n So, uhh the way he's dressed the cane the bell and the pig are\n\nall the symbols or the attributes of Saint Anthony Abbot\n Ehm, does anybody else know who those other two figures are\n This is a Christian image, so can you guess who they are\n\n<$ZF> \n\n<$A>  Mary and Jesus\n Uh does anyone know if Mary usually wears red, like that\n No\n Multiple responses from audience\n\n\n\n<$A>  Blue, right with white\n Multiple\n\nresponses from audience \n\n<$A>  Ya right\n So no she wears the blue right against her body, but she wears\n\nthe red\n Uhm people say it was a symbol of royalty and that therefore it\n\ntells us that she's represented here as Mary Queen of the World uhm but,\n\nit's also the symbol of divinity\n You can see that the image of Christ just beside is wearing a red\n wear it right against here\n she's born an ordinary person\n We also see that around this time, there's a system of\n\nperspective that has been developed because,  \n\n, uhm the idea of painting is  , to convince us that this\n\nis not in fact a flat surface on which there's different paint uhm on the\n\nsurface itself but rather that this is a space and we're    really looking   at this painting as if we're looking\n\nthrough a window out onto the world\n have you done any perspective drawings\n\nat school   \n\n<$ZF> \n\n<$A>  Ya\n Ah do you know what perpective drawings are\n\n<$ZF> \n\n<$ZG> \n\n<$A>  Yes\n\n<$ZH> \n\n<$A> \n So we don't want this to look flat\n We want it to look three dimensional so you can see the lines all\n\nmove towards this vanishing point\n Do you see the floor in particular,\n Right\n Where the tiles quite large in the foreground and as they move\n\ntowards the background you get towards the vanishing point because all the\n\nlines will eventually converge\n In fact if you look at this painting you can see that the ehm,\n\nlines ehm converge at about the top of  head\n You see that the baby's head,\n So that in fact it's leading our eye to him, who is largely the\n\nmost important part of the painting\n Uhm if you look at the background uhm you can see that kind of\n\nthrone,\n Who is that attached to or linked with,\n Who does the throne belong to,\n Hmm,\n It's Mary, right\n Why\n How do we know it's Mary's throne\n\n<$ZI> \n\n<$A>  Cos of the colour right\n The red in the throne links it with the colour red she's wearing\n Ehm and you also see some fabric as part of the design of the\n\nthrone\n\n\nuh, ah  the   fabric design,\n\n<$ZJ> \n\n<$A>  uh\n\n hand   uh the symbol of redemption\n But there's also, a fruit that's part of the, fabric design\n\nor the tapestry design\n Ya the pineapple right\n So the pineapple was actually the symbol of\n\nhospitality so the artist in representing that was inviting    us the viewer   to\n\nlook at the image\n So what I'm just trying to give you an idea of very quickly is how\n\neven though these images are quite realistic we hardly see the paint brush\n\nstroke at all every thing is very well painted each object is there because\n\nit symbolizes something specific and we call that the iconography\n Have you heard of the word icon before,\n\n\n<$ZG> \n\n<$A>  Ya in Windows\n\n So if you think of what an icon does on a computer you click on\n\nthis little sign right or little, uhm design and each one represents\n\nsomething else\n If you think of the painting it's exactly the same kind of system\n Each, little, object whether it be the cane the pig the\n\npineapple, has a specific symbolism\n Does that make sense\n A little bit\n Yes\n Okay so uhm just to give you an idea generally of the language of\n\npainting at the time this is a Flemish painting and they were especially\n\nstrong in different iconography\n Ehm, also at this time you would have never had ah an ordinary\n\n<,> portrait of a person by himself uh but only in such a painting that you\n\ncall a donor painting", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a5157d9d-f089-42c9-a98e-257f816e49df', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:50.824917+00:00',

{'text': "<$A>  When the person who paid for the painting is actually part of\n\npainting itself\n Does anybody have any questions\n\n\n<$ZH> \n\n<$A>  The red\n\n\n<$ZH> \n\n<$A>  Ya it's just part of the throne, and it links it to Mary\n\n\n So but if we think of the colour red or blue and if we think of how\n\npeople, uhm got paint those days\n You know they obviously didn't buy it at their local art stores\n Where would they have gotten the colours to grind, in for the\n\npigments,\n What would those come from\n\n<$ZI> \n Ya they would often come from fruits or vegetables and dyes but the\n\nones that were to last really long would also be, from rocks and minerals\n Right\n red or blue rocks\n\n  in your lifetime\n No\n They're among the most, rare pigments\n\n\n making paintings like this that they're going to reserve these more,\n\nrare colours for the things that have the most important part of the painting\n\nthemselves\n So, we'll see these colours again in the painting ah soon\n Any other questions\n\n\n<$ZJ> \n\n<$A>  Okay I'll show you\n It's uh just right up here\n It's kind of scratched in the painting itself\n So as we ah go to the next room you can take a closer look, at\n\nit \n Any other questions\n No\n\n\n<$A>  Just going to explain a little bit about how the lighting\n\nsystem works,\n Uhm we're actually going to go though this way\n open up directly to\n\nthe to the  well  allows    the   light to\n\ncome directly into these galleries  \n So, those blinds underneath the skylights just are uhm connected\n\nto a computer that, limits the amount of light that comes in\n So if all of a sudden it gets sunny then the blinds will close\n\nquite a bit\n Uh so it's all regulated very specifically\n As we walk through here you're going to see circular windows\n The same type of skylight, exists on the other side of this wall\n\nonly in this case it's to allow the natural lighting to go all the way down\n\nto the Canadian galleries underneath us\n\n\nTape cuts out \n\n<$A>  So I'll begin by talking about the price of this painting\n Not because I think that the price of any, painting is of\n\nparticular significance but I can hear you all talking about it and the first\n\nquestion I was asked was how much is it worth, and I believe it's worth\n\nabout four million dollars\n How much we paid for it uh the National Gallery paid one point\n\nseven eight million for it, a few years ago\n And it was pretty much the purchase of the painting ah that\n\nreceived a lot of attention because this painting was hanging in this room\n\nfor a couple of years before and nobody took much notice of it and then uh\n\nthe Gallery finally bought it and of course it meant for probably the first\n\ntime in the history of Canada uh people were actually talking about art\n So uhm I'll, discuss a little bit why this painting has the\n\nmarket value that it does and then after that I'd be glad to answer any\n\nquestions that you have about that particular aspect of it\n Okay\n So Barnett Newman, is the name of the artist\n He is an American artist\n He was born in nineteen oh two\n He painted this in nineteen sixty-seven\n So how old was he then,\n Sixty-five years old at the time\n He died three years later,\n And uh today in nineteen ninety-five he's considered to be probably\n\nuh the most important artist since the Second World War\n He only did about a hundred and thirty-five works of art in his\n\nlifetime\n And so you can imagine that there are many art galleries like this\n\none, whose mandate it is to collect art that's considered important in its\n\ntime that want to collect works by him and others who worked uh in New York\n\naround the same time\n So, does that answer your question about the market value\n\nitself\n You know supply demand, uhm\n Just like a pair of Nike running shoes or a hockey player\n Right\n It just depends on what people want to spend\n\n\n there   in the world and it drives the price, up\n\n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A> \n That, moves us to stage two\n Suspected speakers\n\nnot recorded \n You guys just want to listen at the back, for a minute\n I'm trying to explain it to you\n You might be wondering why uhm this very simple looking painting\n\n<,> is considered so important\n Right\n Or why the artist who painted it is considered so important\n It looks so simple\n Anybody could do it, blah blah blah,\n Right\n Okay, ehm so what I'll do is I'll take you back further than\n\nnineteen sixty-seven\n I'll take you back to nineteen fifty-one or nineteen fifty-two when\n\nthat little painting over there was painted\n Can you imagine living in that time and seeing a painting like that\n\n\n<$ZL> \n\n<$A>  Pardon me\n\n<$ZL> \n\n<$ZM> \n\n<$A>  Boring,\n What comments do you think people would have made\n\n<$ZL> \n\n<$A>  Plain\n I could do it\n My grandchild could do it\n Right\n Things like that\n Depending on how old we are my little brother et cetera\n So we have to wonder why an artist forty years ago or fifty years\n\nago would decide to put such a simple painting, in the world\n Right\n uh he didn't get very much\n\n , or he didn't have very much support from even other artists\n Jackson Pollock whose work is over there was about the only artist\n\nthat supported him\n I won't give you too much of a sob story of the starving artist but\n\napparently he actually did have to sell things that he owned to put, \n\n  food   on the table,\n So why did he do these simple simple paintings\n One of the reasons was, he wanted his paintings to be for\n\neverybody\n So if we think of, how a painting can be for everybody then we\n\nwill not ask in front of a painting like this, what does it represent in\n\nthe same way that we would ask that question in the painting that I just\n\nshowed you\n Right\n And I very uhm you know uh gradually told you what the other\n\npainting represented\n The cow, or the pig represented this or the uhm pineapple\n\nrepresented that\n So every object had this specific, meaning that was hidden from\n\nus as twentieth century, ah Canadians let's say\n It was really made for fourteenth century Flemish Christians the\n\nlast painting\n\n\n look at the meanings behind it but in fact we are actually going to look\n\nat the painting\n the\n\n  most crucial thing    to   realize when we\n\nlook at this painting\n So, what I'm going to suggest is that we actually look at this\n\nin a very specific way\n I'm going to give you instructions to look at this painting\n mind doing that\n you\n\nknow we   want to see Van Gogh and other things as well\n So would you mind following my instructions for a couple of\n\nminutes,\n I promise you I won't\n\nmake you look at the painting for longer than two minutes\n\n Could I borrow somebody's watch to ensure that, I'll only make\n\nyou look at it for two minutes\n Okay\n Whatever,\n Okay\n I'm timing you\n I would like you to look at the blue stripe on your right hand\n\nside, for the entire two minutes\n\n\n<$ZN> \n\n<$A> \n No no I'll just look at it\n\n We'll just focus our eyes all that time just on the blue to the\n\nright\n try to creep\n\nin a bit but just keep refocusing on the blue \n one minute has gone\n\nby so we'll look at it for another minute \n There are thirty seconds left\n most crucial thirty\n\nseconds, \n Multiple audience members\n\nrespond. Speaker A engages their thoughts \n\n<$A>  Is anybody still looking at the painting\n\n\nMultiple audience members agree \n So see what I mean the difference between looking\n\nat the painting, and looking at the meaning behind it\n Right\n Ehm I just choose that as something specific just cos I know,\n\nour time is fairly limited but I promise you that if, anybody here spent\n\ntwenty minutes in front of this painting with an open mind it would do pretty\n\nincredible, things\n The only thing is is that we live in a society even more then when\n\nthis was made, twenty-five years ago that we expect to get something\n\nreally quick\n Right\n So, it doesn't dawn on people to look at it longer than just to\n\nsay okay it's three stripes and go onto the next thing\n So uhm when I do that\n It's just certainly one way to look at it\n It's not the only way to look at it\n But I know that, it gives you a, pretty dramatic uh effect\n\n\n  want to   give the impression that you know you\n\nhave to have these, special instructions behind every one\n But did you like that experience\n Was it, cool,\n Okay\n So you can see that you have to be here, for the painting to\n\nwork\n You have to be open to what it has to offer\n If you spend, twenty seconds looking at this work, which is\n\nprobably more than a lot of people will spend looking at it then your\n\nexperience is going to be, much different than if you actually sit down\n\nand give it a chance\n Right\n So what we realize is a lot of what we get out of it it comes from\n\nwithin us\n So if we're open to what it has to offer then we'll get something\n If we're just, you know worried about how hard it is to make\n\nfrom a technical point of view we'd probably be, more impressed with the\n\nperson who laid down this floor\n You know\n Uh we don't know the person's name but it's true that person has a\n\nlot of, talent and was probably chosen pretty carefully because of his\n\ntechnical skills\n With art, although the technique is, often important some\n\nartists feel that to accomplish their, idea the technique might be,\n\nmore simple in some cases more involved in others\n\n\n depends     really what kind of things they want to get\n\nacross or what kind of idea they want to get across\n Any comments or questions,\n\n\n<$ZO> \n\n<$A>  Pardon me\n\n<$ZO>  repeats question </O \n\n<$A> \n You know I choose that because it's probably the most dramatic one\n\n   so   it gets across the point really clearly\n If you look at that one it does, neat things too\n It's a little bit more subtle\n\n But uh certainly also in in the nineteen sixties there were a lot\n\nof artists that worked with optical effects, and were interested in that\n\neffect\n I'd say with Barnett Newman what makes him a little bit different\n\nfrom many abstract artists, is that,   , ah he\n\noffers   you a little bit more\n hard to explain a little bit but there's kind\n\nof ah a subject there or something, uhm I'd say more moving in his works\n\nthan some of the Op art that is just optical illusions, although I realize\n\nthat I just showed you an optical illusion\n I said there's other ways of looking at it too,\n Okay,\n Any other, questions comments\n\n\n<$ZP> \n\n<$A>  why don't we\n\ntake a look at it\n do is we'll stand up\n\nin a certain area and we'll all look at it together  \n\n\npainting   uh sculpture  ,\n So if you're towards the centre you'll probably have the best\n\npoint of view,\n so, my first\n\nquestion to you is, is this a beautiful work of art \n No\n So the artist obviously made this so we would have some kind of\n\nreaction other than an aesthetic one\n You know we're going to look at it differently than it's a piece\n\nof wallpaper or a new pair shoes", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '782a04db-d8bb-42b4-be1d-6232427b1196', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:50.826182+00:00', 'english_score': 0.982446014881134, 'non_english_score': 0.017553985118865967}
{'text': "<$A>  Right\n We want to get something, more meaningful out of it\n of\n\nanything in particular\n\n<$ZQ> \n The crucifixion\n But of course you only see the vertical part, of the image\n Right\n cross is\n\ncompleted \n\n<$ZP> \n\n<$A> \n It's just one way of pushing that even further\n But, can you see how this sculpture is on a base, and we uh\n\nbarely see the legs underneath the base, cos it's slightly recessed,\n But it creates a space between the base and the floor\n See what I mean by that\n And how it's filled with a shadow,\n So ya just let your eyes focus on that, shadow\n Am I in the way, for some of you,\n Okay I won't move,\n For let's say five or ten seconds then we'll look up at the\n\nvertical beam, for another few seconds,\n\n optical illusion but you should see a faint white line that\n\ncompletes the crosses\n See what I mean,\n Audience responds affirmatively\n\n\n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$ZQ> \n\n<$A>  Actually it works really well if you,\n\ncrouch down but \n so we'll come and\n\nwe'll look at it much more closely, \n you see\n\nthe surface   of the sculpture\n You can see that it's rusty\n It's made out of core tin steel\n And we actually, uh also see this pronounced rusty line,\n\nright here,\n What does that make you think of,\n The blood, right\n So uh if you think of what I just did I just asked you what you saw\n I sure that I pushed a little bit further by, having you look at\n\nthe shadow but, what, you, just told me comes from you\n I didn't say this is this this is this\n So again just to reiterate what I said before what we get out of\n\nthese works depends entirely on what we give to them\n If we come to this, with a background completely foreign to\n\nChristianity then we're not going to see this as the image of the crucifixion\n Right\n You're going to see it in a different way\n\n\n things about this painting is that it's true we bring our background to\n\nthe work and many people, just brought this huge price tag    with them   as the background and they could\n\nonly look at it as a consumer object\n never let the\n\nexperience go beyond being a shopping centre right where you're, surprised\n\nwhen the price is more expensive than you thought it would be\n So uhm you know just look at these works I'd say and the artist\n\nmade them for you was hoping that you'll probably get or that you'll get\n\nsomething out of them\n So it's really up to us and the more we have to give, the more\n\nwe'll get out of it\n Does that make sense,\n You have any questions,\n Okay\n Tape cuts out\n\n\n So we're in the room with uh Impressionist and Post-Impressionist\n\nartists\n This is a painting by uh Vincent Van Gogh\n Have you heard about him\n Ya\n Two audience members respond\n\n\n\n<$A>  I think the story goes I'm not sure how\n Or the legend goes anyway that he sold one painting in his lifetime\n\nand uh, that was to his brother or something\n\n\n<$ZR> \n\n<$A>  Ya it's true he did a lot of self-portraits\n He did a lot of his paintings within, just a few years\n Anything else that you know about him\n\n<$ZS> \n\n<$A>  I don't know\n I guess you only know the price when it's sold but, one of his\n\npaintings, sold for ninety-eight million\n\n bigger than\n\nthis\n This is on paper\n But uhm you know like ah once you get into the millions there's\n\nnot much difference between  fifty million and eighty million\n\nright\n\n<$ZS> \n\n<$A>  Ya you know in those days people were just labelled as insane\n\nand lived in institutions\n off his\n\near\n and\n\n  and   books \n\n<$A> \n\n\n  around   this time   where you have this break,\n\nor the    beginning of this idea   about the\n\nartist starving and alienated from society instead of the typical artist\n And that's why there's been so many, movies and books written\n\nabout him because    he   lives kind of this\n\nquintessential uhm alienated artist life\n But all of this, is aside in a sense\n But I think that it's all related because uhm, when we look at\n\nhis paintings more than the Memling we just, saw  \n\n in the second   room or other artists I think with Van Gogh\n\nsomehow we get a sense   , that    \n\n his   paintings capture, his personality or we have a feeling\n\nthat we know the artist himself through his art\n reason why is\n\nperhaps uhm a useful way of looking at his work,\n For instance when we look at the grass growing in the background is\n\nhe copying exactly what he sees, repeating the same angles and trying to\n\n   meticulously  , copy nature as it is\n\nexactly,\n No\n Right\n for the\n\nfirst time is the artist deciding himself, mostly hes at this time  what this painting's going to look like\n So we have this subjective view\n\n\n coincides    with   a blade of grass so it\n\nkind of makes sense\n But for instance if you look at the stems, here, you can see\n\nthis blue outline\n Irises don't have blue stems right or blue outlines on them, so\n\nwe can see that the artist is even though he's inspired by nature as a\n\nsubject matter he's deviating from it\n He's deciding to in this case be influenced by Japanese prints,\n\nthat do have these, black or bold outlines\n sources\n\n<,> to make their art\n Also with Van Gogh you know we just spent a few minutes talking\n\nabout his life\n Did we talk about Hans Memling's life, or Barnett Newman's life\n\nnot so much\n or I\n\nguess not Barnett Newman I shouldn't use an example but, the Renaissance\n\nartists we're not so interested in their lives but with modern art, when\n\nwe look at their paintings we    concentrate \n\n on the artist's personal vision    or   their\n\nideas their style rather than the subject matter\n I'm not going to go on for five minutes about what kind of irises\n\nthey are and what time of year they grow or you know    the specificities   about the subject matter but we're\n\nmore interested in how it's painted\n And that's basically something that we could generalize with all\n\nmodern art is we're interested in how it's painted, more, than what is\n\npainted\n Does that make sense\n Ya\n So ah any questions about Van Gogh\n The reason it's under glass is because it's on paper and uh it's a\n\nfairly fragile support\n The paper has been mounted on canvas\n fairly secure\n We have two other paintings by Van Gogh in this room, the,\n\nflowers on uh either side of the far wall \n Somebody asked to see a Picasso\n Who was that,\n Anybody\n Nobody's, owning up to it\n Did somebody mention Picasso, as an artist they wanted to see\n\n\n\n<$ZT>  audience member asks other audience members a question\n\n\n\n<$A> \n I guess I made that up\n\n a painting by uh\n\nPablo Picasso\n\n\n<$ZU> \n\n<$A>  Ya okay\n\n<$ZT> \n\n<$A>  Good\n\n Uhm, we've literally gone full circle and uh, I mean in the\n\ngalleries but also, in the history of art,\n When we started with that painting, Hans Memling the\n\nRenaissance painting where all of these objects were meticulously painted I\n\nsaid that the ideal at that time was    to treat\n\na painting   as if you were looking through a window outside of the\n\n in uh sorry outside into the world\n Ehm so you would substitute the window frame for the painting\n\nframe and you got this feeling of space\n What we get with Picasso is it's as if it's the same the same\n\nwindow is literally broken\n So all of the sudden we see these, flat planes that are\n\nintersecting and it creates, a surface all of its own with its own\n\ninterests\n It's not trying to pretend to represent trees or forests or\n\nsomething that exists in the world but it's a surface that has its own entity\n\nthat exists on its own\n said that uhm there are\n\ncertain elements that we can recognize\n The title of this work is The Small Table\n audience members\n\nrespond \n Ya maybe the legs or something here that\n\n Ya\n I'm thinking more of, here are the strings and then the upper\n\npart of the guitar up here\n See the wallpaper on the wall behind it,\n Ya\n the wallpaper back there\n\n\n actual letters or are they paintings of letters,\n Is there a difference between letters and paintings of letters\n No\n Cos letters are a two dimensional sign for something\n Right\n\n\nno difference really\n So by putting letters on the surface what the artist is saying\n\nthis is a flat surface on which these things are signs\n a way of\n\ntreating   Ah well\n\n<$ZT> \n So he's saying I'm not trying to say this is a real bowl of fruit\n\nbut this is something on its own\n\n<$ZT> \n It's paint on a canvas\n So it's affirming the fact this is two dimensional and it's not\n\nthis space\n You know we're looking at this in nineteen ninety-five\n We just saw Barnett Newman's Voice of Fire which is, totally\n\n<,> flat and, has no object, represented or depicted in it at all\n So we have to think of looking at this in nineteen nineteen where\n\nthis was quite new to see these spaces and ah forms represented in a\n\ncompletely, new way\n could\n\ncall this a Cubist painting although uhm something like that round one is ah\n\na much better example, of typical, Cubism \n I'll bring you back down into the Canadian Galleries\n Rideau Street Convent\n\nChapel \n I'll show you where it is anyway\n And then the Group of Seven and then, uhm what you can do is\n\nfind the elevator from off there\n\n\nTape continues as a conversation between A and a few members of the group\n\n \n\n\n\n<$A>  I'm working here at the museum\n I'm in the Education department\n be doing an\n\nexhibition today called Rights and Realities\n material for it\n\nso you've at least seen some of the slides and you know a little about what\n\nyou're going to look at\n we're going to break it up\n\ninto    a couple   of different ways of\n\none going through the exhibition and two talking a little bit about work that\n\nyou're doing yourselves, combining this all in\n It's really nice having a small group cos I like it to be really\n\ninformal\n So as much talking back and forth\n If you have questions ask\n like to go off the\n\ntrack sometimes if there's something, about the exhibition or about\n\nsomething in photogrqaphy that you want to know more about\n First thing I'm going to do, is tell you something about the C\n\nM C P , this museum\n Have you ever been here before,\n So this is all your first trip\n Alright I can give you some background on the institution cos that\n\nhelps you understand what the collection is all about\n Cos we have ah a collection that's really split into two really\n\ndistinct uhm categories\n That being uhh documentary photography and what's considered art\n\nphotography or experimental, photography uhm using different mediums,\n\nother photographic, style and genre\n Originally in nineteen forty-one uh C M C P was part of the\n\nNational Film Board and everybody knows the National Film Board\n Uh it is the Still Photography Division which was very important\n It was a unit that went across Canada documenting the country\n It was one of the best methods that Canada had for selling Canada\n\nto immmigration post-war immigration, and it was also a way of solidifying\n\na real Canadian identity or fostering an idea of a Canadian identity\n In terms of because of the expanse of the land, people out on\n\nthe west coast were able to see photographs from people on the east coast and\n\nso it brought communities together", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '9af9dc51-c7c4-47a2-a786-a741e041d079', 'added':

{'text': '<$A>  Ah this continued\n National Film Board\n\n until about nineteen eighty-five and then in eighty-five along with,\n\na number of different cutbacks uhh the entire collection at that point was\n\nput into archives, and the entire institution was shut down\n I mean people continued to work people continued to acquire uhm\n\npieces for the collection but we didn\'t have a home\n There wasn\'t anywhere to be\n So they started work building this place\n And first of all it took uhm about five years to find the location\n This location had been an old railway tunnel which is why,\n\narchitecturally it\'s this design, very long narrow, and deep\n Uh it runs from what used to be the uhm train station which is down\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> Centre out to the big\n\n\ntoday\n Okay\n You know that big bridge over there uhm the Princess Alice or\n\nAlexander\n I can\'t remember what it\'s called\n all hooked up\n It\'s all, tied into one\n So our collection as it stands now\n This building was opened in uh ninety-two\n So it\'s relatively new\n The collection has about a hundred and sixty pieces\n black and white colour slides uhm, print images in\n\nsome installation pieces\n Cos there are a number of artists who are working in photography as\n\ninsallation pieces\n Uh we have an acquisitions budget annually about a hundred and\n\nfifty thousand dollars\n Uh it\'s a small staff who works here\n It\'s nothing like the National Gallery which is this huge staff\n\nwhich is\n It\'s a big institution and it\'s very hard to get your work into\n\nthat institution\n\n\nalmost daily   with portfolios having assessments done by curators\n So we\'re very accessible\n you know\n\n  you know   young artists coming in    and\n\n  the stuff that they\'ve got\n Now as a result, these two exhibitions that we have Rights and\n\nRealities and the one in the next, uhm gallery called Dialogue which after\n\nwe\'re done with Rights and Realities you\'re more than welcome to go through\n\nand take a look at uhh fall into a real journalism documentary style\n We don\'t have really anything that would be except for this piece\n\nhere that\'s done by the uh group  <unclear> word </unclear> \n\nCulture   uhm it\'s the only piece that would be considered,\n\nmodern or experimental\n Uh some of our earlier uhm exhibitions in the summer and last\n\nspring were more, contentious a little more bizarre a little more,\n\ninteresting in that more art vein\n we have to try\n\nand balance   and do a little bit of each style\n Uhm also because we\'re trying to target different uhm people,\n\n   to come   in and see the uh exhibitions\n Now uhm any questions about the museum\n Anything that, you\'re really interested in about it\n Okay,\n Two minute\n\nquestion and answer discussion with extra-corpus audience members \n\n<$A>  getting the\n\nright idea\n Essentially uhm journalism is a photographic witness, to\n\nsomething that\'s immediate, and it\'s a very short, uhm exercise\n very little preamble\n\nand there\'s very little follow-up\n It\'s just the one image\n With documentary uh you usually have, it, working more like a\n\nstudy\n So you\'ll have people working for maybe a number of weeks months\n\neven years on one subject, so that it really ends up becoming a text\n\nitself\n It has this notion of a beginning a middle and an end\n And it can be accompanied by text but not necessarily\n It often goes into a book form or a magazine form\n And it\'s more of a large format deal\n Uhm but the approach, is almost the same\n are recording, and recording\n\nis the thing that\'s most important\n It\'s keeping a record and keeping track of some, event or uhm a\n\nculture or a group of people or a community,\n Now what we\'re going to look at with Rights and Realities, is\n\n<,,> a bridge between the two\n In a way it\'s documentary, but it\'s more like photojournalism\n Uh the project was put together by a man named David Barber who\n\nworked for CIDA\n Does anyone know what CIDA is,\n Canadian International Development Association\n It\'s located here in Ottawa\n It\'s a federally-funded institution who goes around, worldwide\n\n   usually   well predominantly third\n\nworld project building\n They go into uhm villages in let\'s say Zaire and put in uh project\n\nleaders to help build water irrigation systems and uhm put in for education\n\nuhm healthcare uhm agriculture, uhm political development designing\n\ninfrastructures for countries that have gone through war and don\'t have \n\n  like    a   political\n\nor a social or urban infrastructure  \n They design all these for them, or with them\n Not " for them " but " with them\n\n"\n Uhm, so, CIDA is always going around with photographers\n\ntaking photographs of their projects using it for their publications\n So there\'s already an interest in photography there\n Then, in order to get more funding cos these things always cost\n\na lot of money, they went to an institute that\'s in Montreal called the\n\nInternational Institute for Human Rights and Democratic Development\n seems to be an unrecorded\n\naudience response \n No\n It\'s a pretty new group\n seems to\n\nbe an unrecorded audience response \n Okay\n\n\n International\n It\'s a watchdog group\n They look at different countries\n pinpoint areas where human\n\nrights are in conflict, and uh where they\'re being violated\n So then they came to us here at the museum, because the person\n\nor the project leader wanted to have, this group of photographs curated\n\nby uhm an institute well shown, by an institution but curated by someone\n\nwho was professionally involved with photographs, from a purely uhm\n\naesthetic technical, point of view\n Someone who wasn\'t involved with the issues but just with\n\nphotographs, because all too often when we use project people, to\n\nchoose images you get clichéd images\n Does anyone know what I mean by a clichéd image,\n What is it\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  Right\n the purpose of a\n\nclichéd image\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A> \n that\'s on a positive side\n We could also look at this as being a very manipulative, way of\n\n<,>    getting people to think a certain way\n\n \n It can be very manipulative\n And the one thing that we have to remember about photographs,\n\nare that they are manipulative, and that while we have, to,\n\ncertainly abandon a certain amount towards believing what we see as being\n\nreal, always remember that someone took the photograph, someone made a\n\nselection, someone, chose to uh put something in the frame and someone\n\nchose to leave something out of the frame\n So you should always come to any image with a really healthy\n\nquestioning, about okay why am I being shown this picture, how does it\n\nwork with the text, what\'s missing,\n Like what am I not seeing\n Cos it\'s so easy for us especially photographs in black and white\n\nuhm to just believe everything\n Anybody tell me why we tend to see journalistic photographs in\n\nblack and white,\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A> \n What else,\n How do you react if you see uhm images in colour or images in black\n\nand white,  particularly  these images something shocking \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  Right\n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$A>  Which the colour or the black and white\n\n Uhm, I think maybe what it is that with colour uh you tend to be\n\nmore dazzled by the colour, than by the actual image, so that if you\n\nsee uh an image of someone lying dead in a pool of blood in colour, it\'s\n\nvery graphic, and we desensitize ourself to what exactly is going on but\n\nyou see that same image in black and white and you have to really look,\n\nand you have to think about, the image, and actually think that this is\n\na person lying dead in a pool of blood and,  \n\n, how graphic that\'s made in our mind   as opposed to how it\'s\n\nmade graphic on the page\n magazines like uh Maclean\'s\n\nCanadian publications like Maclean\'s use a lot of colour, for all their\n\nnews stories but  then  their news stories if you look if you go in\n\nand you look through Maclean\'s you\'ll find that their news stories    tend   to be pretty one dimensional and fairly flat\n Colour for them is just fashionable\n Colour is very fashionable right now, in terms of news\n It\'ll, pass\n But black and white will always stay predominantly the uhm medium\n\nof choice for most photographers, uh just because it is more gritty\n\n\n in black and white\n is the language of\n\ncontract\n\n That gives it this idea of real and legal, and uh believable uh\n\ntrustworthy so    that\'ll   last\n Now, this particular exhibition has, six photopraphers,\n\nas you\'re aware\n All women,\n All but uh one of them Cindy Andrew is in fact is a\n\nphotojournalist\n She lives in New Delhi\n Her husband\'s a uh print journalist\n They both cover mm uh Southeast Asia\n The\n\nGlobe and Mail: Canadian newspaper  but she also    is\n\n  within an agency\n So she does freelance\n The other five women are, predominantly documentary, people\n\nwho work in both photography and film and video\n Uh they work on projects for uhm, non-governmental\n\norganizations uh government organizations uhm international governments as\n\nwell as uhm our own Canadian government\n So they tend to spread around\n All of them have done shoots in foreign countries, have done\n\nshoots that involved looking at communities and projects, although not\n\nnecessarily in the country that they\'ve shot in for this particular\n\nexhibition\n The exhibition is current\n\n\n  they went off   to shoot last uh March\n They finished shooting March April May\n It was a two-month shoot\n Uh it cost, eight thousand dollars per person,\n They shot off about a hundred and thirty sometimes a little more\n\nrolls of film\n So one way or another there\'re about two thousand roughly two\n\nthousand images per photographer\n Uh CIDA kept, about uh a hundred and seventy-five of them\n The rest went back to the photographers, which in a way is\n\npayment, uh cos they didn\'t make hardly any money uhm doing this job\n It was more because it was a really interesting project,\n But they can then use their photographs\n They can sell them\n They can re-use them\n They can, get some income from them\n too bad\n Uhm what I want to do first of all is I\'m going to have you read\n\n<,,> the introductory panel, very quickly\n It tells you what\'s going on what the whole project\'s about,\n\ncos what I want to do more is look at the photographs\n Not so much the issues of what they\'re photographing but how\n\nthey\'re photographed to make you, understand or not understand as the case\n\nmay be\n So we\'ll start with this, and then I\'m going to introduce you\n\nto the first photographer and then I\'m going to let you go spend about\n\nfifteen minutes, looking at the other photographers, and  then \n\nI want to get back together and talk, \n One thing I\'d like to go over is how this uhm exhibition is\n\ncurated\n when you walk into a\n\ngallery or    anywhere where  , images are\n\nbeing hung   ,  so     \n\nlook at the images but to look at how the images are hung and think about why\n\nthey\'re hung in a certain way\n Uhm often there\'s a reason\n Uhm sometimes it\'s just aesthetic\n Sometimes it has more to do with uhm a political statement or it\n\ncan be any way    of   communicating an idea that\n\nthe curator or the artist is trying to present, outside of just the image\n So first of all what we\'ve done here is we have a very brief,\n\nbiography, on the photographer, but we\'ve also included a photograph\n\nof each photographer', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL',

{'text': "<$A>  And in this case Stephanie Colvy is the woman in the middle\n\n<,,>\n And what this does is all of a sudden you get to see the artist\n And all too often we see what the artist does but we don't really\n\nknow what the artist looks like,    and   often\n\nit's nice to be able to    have some sort of\n\n  intimate relationship, with the artist just based on    what   they look like and form an opinion based on their\n\nface and    the   character that they have cos\n\nthat helps you, understand and maybe see aspects of a style or an\n\naesthetic or    a   feel that comes out of their work\n Next we, did a blow up of,\n Does anyone know what this is,\n Contact sheet,\n So it's a blow up of a contact sheet\n And what we wanted to do was make sure that people, who visited\n\n   the   museum who don't really have a close\n\nrelationship with photography understand how photographs are taken, in\n\nthis sort of, uhm style\n\n\n these are not posed images\n They're not one-offs\n They're not constructed images\n So what you'll do is you'll end up using a roll of thirty-six\n And as you can see, in this section from sixteen down to about\n\ntwenty-seven she's just shooting the same sort of thing over and over again\n\nwaiting for the sun to change waiting for shadows to change waiting for\n\npeople to come into and out of the frame\n As you see, in here just getting, whatever she can sort of\n\nin\n You want to be able to pick up the natural rhythm of a person's day\n\nas opposed to jumping in and disrupting them by taking these, contrived\n\n<,,> images of them\n So photographing this way, takes a really long time, takes a\n\nnumber of hours\n most of it\n\nwell all    six   photographers were in agreement\n\nit would take them at least an hour before, they even, started to shoot\n\nan image\n it\n\ntook   uhm Cindy Andrew seven hours before the women that she was\n\ninterviewing would let them take photographs of her\n So you really have to, be interested in your subject\n You have to really have uhm patience, and a really clear idea of\n\n<,,> getting to know the people based on who they are and what they're doing\n\nand really taking the time\n After that you notice all the photographs are once again in black\n\nand white\n one image that's in large\n\nformat, and the other nine are all, in the same, eleven by\n\nfourteen, sixteen by twenty,\n And this is the way the show's curated\n Now what I'm going to do\n Do you have any questions about just this, portion that I'm\n\nshowing you right now,\n Okay\n What I'm going to do is I'm going to give you uhm an activity sheet\n\n<,> but you don't have to fill this out\n It's not like go to each question\n It's just, when you're looking at the photographs and when\n\nyou're thinking about, making these assessments    you\n\nknow and   putting these relationships together you can use this in\n\nsome cases just to, remember things uhm look at different ways to look at\n\nthe image\n It's more like a guideline more than anything else\n But if there's anything that occurs to you about something you can\n\nalways I mean jot it down, something that if you want to remember so we\n\ncan talk about it later\n So that's all this is,\n So I'm just going to give you these,\n word\n\n</unclear>\n There\n And you can have some pencils too just in case you do feel,\n\nlike you want to\n Cos all too often we come and we look at images and we intuitively\n\nask the right questions and make the right, conclusions and judgements\n\nbut sometimes you know in this sort of situation you sort of miss one or two\n\nthings,\n Great\n I've got\n That's here and also this is, an evaluation\n We're starting a, little\n At the end if I can get that back from you that would be great\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  Now what I'm going to do is let you go into the galleries,\n All Rights and Reality is in this, right-hand gallery and uhm\n\nit starts here after Stephanie Colvy's, with uhm Sheryl Albuquerque here\n\nand then you just follow it all the way around going sort of to your left\n\n<,,> around and around\n Okay you're on your own for a few minutes,\n a few\n\nwords </unclear> oh about    well twenty\n\nto two   \n\n<$A>  Now then, we've all gone through the exhibition I'd like\n\nyour impressions of it\n What did you think of the project, and then the idea of this\n\n   as   a project \n\n<$A> \n\npa    ah that are   exotic because one  \n\n you're   looking at things you don't always see and you're\n\nlooking at people who you know\n we see\n\nLatin Americans here in this country but we're just seeing them in\n\ncircumstances that you don't normally see so you can, suspend your uhm\n\nrelationship with them\n But then when you see the images the Canadian images that's\n How did you relate to these\n\n\nwhat do you think about her photographs, \n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  The Montreal photographs\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  want you to\n\nknow that    if   you hate something say I hate it\n You don't have to like it, just cos it's hanging on the wall\n how it works\n Uhm if you really, don't think something is effective or you\n\ndon't like a photographer's style tell me because, in some cases, well\n\nI'll agree with you\n it's important cos that's how we\n\nmake decisions about    what   we like and what we\n\ndon't like \n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n\nCheryl  \n Ya\n What if I said that Cheryl uses uhm uh photographic metaphor,\n at the photograph of\n\nthe kids in the tree, would everyone look at that and read the text that\n\ngoes with it \n\n<$A>  Ya okay\n That photograph is really a metaphor\n\n\n  uhm visually in the same way that you can use metaphors,\n\nuhm in speech so that you can have that same, way of constructing meaning\n same way that you can construct\n\na metaphor out of words in a sentence you can construct a metaphor out of\n\nimages in the frame of a photograph\n And if you look at that one in particular what you see is a little\n\ngirl knocking sticks out of a tree with a little boy sitting up in the\n\nbranches\n And then when you read the text the text tells you that, by age\n\neleven she's going to be married and as he uhm gets older he's going to\n\nassume a more powerful role in the community and will probably take over from\n\nhis father as being the Sultan or whatever it is of that community\n So she is always going to be, ah as a woman uh and a married\n\nwoman in a subservient role to him\n He will always be in a patriarchal position to her\n He'll always be elevated\n He'll always be on a throne\n He'll always be above her\n So you get, from this image uh the whole fact that it's in a\n\ntree and trees symbolizing generations and life and sort of ah a perpetuity\n\nand the fact that this is a cultural group who are comfortable within their\n\ncultural norms,\n Although they are trying the women in these communities are uhm\n\ntrying to establish certain changes but not massive changes\n They like being uh Muslims\n They like living the way they do\n There are just a few things they want to change\n Uhm, so it's not like there's going to be this huge massive,\n\nfemale revolution going on there and a whole change in their whole\n\nsensibility\n And that photograph works as a metaphor\n So she, likes to use that\n Do you see what I'm getting at,\n Okay\n What about with uhm Iva Zimova,\n do you notice about how she\n\nsets up her shots\n drawing attention\n\nto this is so when you're taking photographs while you're making images that\n\nyou can sometimes think about, references    references\n\n  that uhm make people remember other things, that  are going\n\nto  make, the point you're trying to get across that much more solid\n And that's, predominantly what Iva does\n you pick out something\n Try to figure out where I'm going with this\n\n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A> \n\n What about the, first image the larger image or especially a\n\nnumber of the images that are in the contact sheets\n Uh you might be able to see them from here\n See\n So there's some images in the contact sheet in the lower half plus\n\nthe large image and in particular say the second last image, also the\n\nsubway image\n how\n\n  are they set up\n\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A> \n Right\n\n And so how does that make you feel, when you look at it,\n\n\n\n<$A>  Well she likes to use movement, in her frames\n You can see that by people gesturing,\n So she likes to have this idea of movement that something is\n\nactually, flowing\n There's ah ah energy that's going on in the image\n But also when she uses these, tilted, camera perspectives\n\n<,,> it gives you a bit of an unbalanced feeling, a little bit\n\n\nyou're kind of   it's knocking you   off balance,\n\n\nyou're trying   to make your eye straighten it, you're trying to\n\nfix it, but it's knocking you a little off balance\n Uhm in art history have you studied the Expressionists, and\n\nsort of early uhm eastern European uh say Czech modernists uh    any of the   artwork coming out of pre-war Germany,\n\nuh late-twenties or late-thirties\n Does anybody know

she's just going somewhere, uh like out for dinner with her\n\nhusband she's always got a little instamatic\n She's always got a camera on herself, somewhere uh cos if\n\nsomething happens she doesn't want to miss it\n Uhm, but, in one instance she was driving along\n Actually uhm not this particular photograph but it came at the\n\nsame time that she did this particular photograph\n She was driving along they were on the road somewhere and she saw\n\nuh    ah some   kids playing, by the side of\n\nthe road and so they pulled over, and she got out and she had her camera\n\nand,\n It's important to be able to speak some of the language of\n\nwherever it is you are\n That's really important\n\n\nwent with interpreters\n if you're in this\n\nprofessionally you've always got an interpreter, but   \n\nyou've   got to know some of the language anyway\n So she always, comes up she introduces herself uh she asks them\n\nlike what are you doing do you live near here are your family around dah dah\n\ndah dah dah\n Then she says I'm from Canada, and I'm a photographer and would\n\nit be alright for me to take your picture\n Some people will go ya, great,\n Other people will go no\n And if someone says no, you just don't take their picture,\n\never\n Uhm, she said that you end up,\n As a woman you can sometimes get away with taking some shots,\n\nthat you might not be allowed to take\n As a man you can get really hurt\n Uhm, you had to be careful\n Ah in one instance she took a photograph in India of a cremation\n\nuhm, but only because she had been a woman was she allowed to get the shot\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  One thing that is a constant, whatever solution we decide\n\non, we all have to live together in Montreal\n French English ethics we have to live together\n There is no choice in that\n Whatever solution you adopt, has to come to that choice,\n Now, we've been faced so far, with two solutions,\n One of them is, what I call by shorthand the Joe Clark\n\nsolution\n That is, give the separatists whatever they want,\n Audience\n\nresponds \n have\n\ngot to   admire Joe because here's something that hasn't worked for\n\ntwenty-five years, and he still has faith\n admire him,\n\nbut I don't have the slightest desire to follow him,\n The other choice we've been faced with, is, the choice\n\noffered by the separatists\n That is to split Canada off, or split Quebec off from the rest\n\nof Canada\n The trouble with that solution is, that we are not all going to\n\nlive together here very happily,\n In fact, if the referendum had been won by fifty-one percent\n\nand if Quebec had separated, could you imagine what life would have been\n\nlike, in a place, in which forty-nine percent of the people didn't\n\nwant to be there,\n And precisely the same problem, applies to partition,\n If you partition Quebec if you say okay, we feel differently\n\nwe'll cut off this part of Quebec, what's wrong with that is you've\n\nrecreated exactly the same problem the separatists have created,\n You've got a situation in which, almost half the people of\n\nMontreal, wouldn't want to be here,\n So that doesn't work,\n I think there's another route to go,\n There's a\n I want to caution\n\nyou too as I say this do not assume, that federation by itself would be a\n\nsolution\n That somehow, if we could settle it all and stay united that\n\nwould cure everything,\n It wouldn't\n We've been a part of federation for the last thirty years\n It doesn't strike me that we have been a very happy people as a\n\nresult either French nor English\n So we have to look at the problem a different way,\n And the way I want you to look at it is this,\n think back to the\n\nBible, the story of Cain, and Abel, the children of Adam and Eve\n\n<,,>\n Cain was a hunter,\n He had weapons,\n And Abel, was a farmer,\n He grew crops and raised animals,\n And Cain, killed Abel,\n There's a lesson in that,\n In the early days, our ancestors ran wild and presumably naked\n\nthrough the woods, hunting, and carried weapons, but some of them\n\nlearned how to grow crops, and raise animals\n And once they learned how to grow crops and raise animals they,\n\nhad to settle in one place,\n That one place becomes the village,\n And the people in the village lived together in large groups first\n\nbecause they look after their crops and animals secondly because they have to\n\ncooperate with each other,\n But while they're living together like that in cooperation,\n\nthey don't like strangers\n And the reason they don't like them is because the wilderness is\n\nso full of our other ancestors\n Not my family\n But still full of our other ancestors who are wild, and hunted\n\nand had weapons and who were dangerous, and who would try and break in\n\nand steal their animals and their crops,", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1fbe4345-da8e-4005-96b3-99bc413a4035', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:50.831164+00:00',

{'text': 'Some cases what happened, the wild people did break in, and they\n\nsubdued the village, and they stayed and they took it over, and they\n\nbecame kings,\n And when they did the village changed,\n The village before had been inward-looking, protective,\n\ndefensive distrustful of strangers, but the kings who come    to the village  \n\nthe warriors they organize the people\n They make them do things they wouldn\'t have done by themselves before\n\n<,>\n They build canals\n They build roads\n They reach out\n They carry trade\n They build empires,\n What they build, is the city, and the city\'s a different kind\n\nof an animal, from the village,\n Very different indeed\n The city is outward-looking,\n The people of the city, don\'t look at themselves\n They look out to the rest of the world when they\'re expanding and\n\nviewing,\n And because they\'re growing fast and because they\'re aggressive and\n\nbecause they\'re, adventurous, the city has to pull in people all the\n\ntime new people immigrants,\n And because it\'s always pulling in new people, it has to be\n\ntolerant, cos those people are going to be different\n It has to accept them,\n Compare that with the village\n The village people, inward-looking defensive don\'t like strangers\n\nprotective,\n They want to preserve their culture,\n The city mentality outward-looking aggressive tolerant varied a\n\nmixture of people\n You\'ll still find that today\n I lived for three years in Prince Edward Island\n It\'s the biggest village in Canada,\n You can go to Prince Edward Island, for two weeks\n That\'s okay\n You go there to live there they\'ll never accept you\n They\'ll never trust you because you\'re from away,\n They only trust you if you were born there,\n You leave Montreal you go and live in any small village you\'ll soon\n\nfind you\'re not accepted, cos you\'re different\n Cos in the village they all look like each other\n They all talk like each other\n They all go to the same church\n They all have same ideas,\n They don\'t like anybody who\'s different,\n City though, we are all different,\n Just look around this room,\n We\'re a very mixed group\n We look differently from each other\n Some of us talk different languages\n We have different values,\n And we can all sit together as we couldn\'t in a village because in\n\nthe city, we have to accept each other,\n If you look at the history of Montreal, you\'ll find on the first\n\nday the city was founded back in sixteen forty-two\n And I hope I got that date right cos I have a terrible time with it\n Sixteen forty-two I\'m sure\n They landed, about a hundred and some odd people, on, the\n\nwater bank, right near Gibbys restaurant, and they celebrated a mass\n And you know what the priest at that mass said\n He said the most amazing thing,\n Here he\'s got these people thousands of miles from France,\n They\'re in the middle of a wilderness,\n They\'re surrounded by hostile Indians\n If I were giving the sermon I\'d say, you are here to huddle\n\ntogether and protect each other,\n be a rough go\n That\'s not what he said,\n you are a grain of mustard seed whose branches\n\nwill reach out to cover the Earth  ,\n Think of that,\n you\'re here to reach\n\nout,\n And the city was planted here, not so you could huddle together\n It\'s here because this is where the Ottawa and the St. Laurence\n\nrivers join and from here you can reach into the interior, reach out for\n\ntrade and expand across the continent,\n Compare that to Quebec City,\n Quebec City, up on a mountain top with walls around where\n\nstrangers can\'t get in, \n Quebec represents essentially a village mentality\n\n\n\n It\'s a city,\n Because of its history you find that when North America was explored\n\nby the French the explorers usually set out from Montreal\n This was the place that reached out,\n And the industry that developed in Canada the railway that was built\n\nacross Canada the banks that were built across Canada started in Montreal\n\n<,,>\n And in fact Montreal reached out so far that at one time Montreal\n\nbuilt the railways of Africa,\n Most of them built by Sir Percy Girouard,\n Street\'s named after his father who didn\'t do anything,\n\n Montrealers built the railways of Brazil\n Montrealers built railways in China,\n Montreal was the centre of ocean shipping empire The Montreal\n\nSteamship Company\n You still see their office down in Old Montreal,\n You know a funny thing, if you look at the history of elections in\n\nQuebec you will normally see that Montreal has voted differently from the\n\nrest of the province,\n with any\n\nbig city, Toronto New York,\n similar pattern,\n The big city normally votes differently from the rest of its region\n Think back if you can to all the Duplessis years in Quebec,\n Union\n\nNationale ,  his votes\n\ndidn\'t come from here\n He got very few votes here\n His votes came from the rest of the province,\n\n\nprovincial political party  look where its votes   \n\ncame   from\n For the most part they did not come from Montreal\n They came from the rest of the province\n Look at the results of the referendum,\n Montreal, was decidedly " no "\n It was parts of the rest of the province that voted " yes\n\n"\n That difference has always been there and it\'s there, it\'s there\n\nbecause, a big city, is a different kind of an animal\n It has different needs\n It has different attitudes\n But big cities generally are the prisioners of the political region\n\nthey\'re in and you\'re prisoners of the political agenda of the region,\n And the region is normally dominated by what I call the village\n\nmentality, the defensive, protective mentality\n Look at the program of the separatists, protect, preserve,\n\nprevent change,\n These are all aspects of the village outlook and they\'re all death to\n\nthe big city,\n\n\n people conform to make them all the same,\n It can\'t afford to be intolerant to difference,\n But the big cities are prisoners of the larger regions they find\n\nthemselves in,\n We are not the first people to notice this,\n This has been noticed in Europe\n And in Germany for example, large cities are given, their own\n\nconstitutional status,\n They\'re given their own constitutional powers,\n They still remain part of the country\n They still remain part of the larger region they\'re in, but they\n\nhave their own powers because their needs are different,\n You are not going unite the French and English and the Ethnics of\n\nMontreal on separation,\n You are not going to unite them simply on confederation, but,\n\nthere is a very strong possibility, you can unite them on the question of\n\nMontreal having its own special status in the Constitution and its own powers\n\n<,> and its own freedom to develop as it wishes to\n And I think that is probably the most useful route that we can\n\nexplore in the near future,  \n\n\n\n<$A> \n\nthought, people

naturally in the future nobody wants to hire\n\nfull-time employees anymore\n Uh everybody\'s trying to hold their job\n You\'ve got downsizing\n And if you can save your job in one company or move to another you\n\nhave the same problems associated there\n situation\n It\'s a winning situation for a company because when they have\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>  employee  they no longer have to pay the\n\nbenefits\n when you get your salary\n\nyou\'re taxed at source\n So if you make fifty thousand dollars typically you may be taxed\n\nat about fifty percent so come home with twenty-five

for the tax\n\nwrite-offs that you aren\'t eligible for as an employee\n So there are advantages to being in business for yourself,\n Another thing to establish at the start is that if there are any\n\nquestions I  won\'t  wait till the end to ask are any questions\n As an idea comes to your mind or if we\'re doing something and you\n\nwant clarification, don\'t hesitate to ask a question cos

constantly\n the certainty of misery is better than the misery of\n\nuncertainty \n That's uh from a Pogo cartoon and it shows why a lot of people are\n\nresistant to change and deny change because they are comfortable in what\n\nthey've done so long that they don't    want to  \n\nchange because it's certainty\n\n cop for six years by the\n\nway in Westmount\n, I'm going into my\n\nfifth career  \n Uh I was a cop back in the sixties in Westmont for six years and we\n\nnoticed this phenomenon with abused women\n Often we'd go and we'd ask them to get out of the relationship\n Like we'd get the same call over and over back to the same home to\n\nthe same abusive relationship we'd say come lay charges get rid of him,\n\nand you know what again     the   certainty\n\nof misery is better than the misery of uncertainty  and they wouldn't\n\nbreak away from that relation because they got, trapped into this, uh\n\nhabit or if you will comfort zone of certainty,\n bottom line is in order\n\nto be an entrepreneur you have to be comfortable with a roller coaster of\n\nuncertainty\n people\n\nare exciting and for other people they're, scary\n Some people hate the roller coaster\n Other people love the roller coaster\n because\n\n   in   your own business you're not going to get\n\nthat certainty of the regular paycheck the nine to five  that  you\n\nknow exactly what's going tomorrow\n Tomorrow is undetermined, and that's the excitement of it\n That's the fun of it is nothing happens tomorrow until you make it\n\nhappen\n and it puts a lot on your\n\nshoulders but it's going to be fun\n it as\n\nexciting and fun as opposed to being fearful\n what what\n\n  ha what   makes them tick\n I'll show you some uh information here on uh, business majors\n\nversus entrepreneurship majors versus non-business majors\n In terms of conformity, you can see that entrepreneurship majors\n\nhave a, very low level of conformity than do business majors and\n\nnon-business majors\n\n\nuh, hurt by social sabotage\n Social sabotage is the concept that if you have a good idea for a\n\nbusiness first thing you do is go tell, your, spouse your, relatives\n\nyour friends they'll say wow is ever that a good idea\n You're all pumped up\n You're ready to go,\n\n You're nuts\n Don't be crazy\n Go and get a real job\n Right\n allow that to take\n\nthe wind out of your sails, then you're stuck in that trap of conformity\n In other words you're not doing what's normal or expected so\n\ntherefore,    you don't   fit in\n You have to be able to break that bond\n You have to be able to, go even though everybody says no it\n\ndoesn't make sense\n less\n\n or  more   innovative more creative\n More off the wall, perhaps\n Energy level much higher,\n You know I find that\n set\n\nhere\n\n In other words I don't see high energy people going in business for\n\nthemselves\n I see that going in business for yourself picking up your energy,\n if you will\n to a\n\nregular job nine to five every day    it's  \n\ndraining\n It's tiring\n You're exhausted\n\n In fact the less you do in the job the more tiring it is\n If that makes any sense whatsoever\n And it's even going to work and coming home\n Uh I see them on the commuter trains\n\n You ever see the people\n They're a herd going in in the morning and coming home at night\n Are they smiling\n, do they look like they're going off to\n\nhave a good time\n No way,\n They're exhausted\n\n\nthey've got to work \n energy level is not there\n And at work if your boss says would you mind doing this oh boy huh\n\nnot another thing\n You watch an entrepreneur in action and you'll see these people\n\nfifteen sixteen hours a day\n I've had entrepreneurs into my class\n\n\nhaving  had a full day come into my class eight twenty-five to, ten\n\nthirty or ten fifty at night, and they're on top of their game\n And the students say excuse me, how many hours a day, do you\n\nwork\n And do you know what they answer\n They look funny and they go, I don't know cos it's not work\n if you get a job that you\n\nlike you'll never have to work another day in your life \n Well that's what it's all about for entrepreneurs\n They don't count hours\n There is no such thing\n There is no on and off\n There is no talk about beep time to go home,\n\n\ntheir     work runs into their life\n working sixteen hours no\n\nproblem\n Uh interpersonal effect, much lower\n Interpersonal effect means the impact that people have on you\n In other words how much you are influenced by others\n And actually if you're highly influenced by others you're not going\n\nto  go  into business for yourself because it won't take long for\n\nsomeone to decide that would be crazy <unclear> word </unclear> go with the\n\nother way instead\n Risk taking higher\n Social adroitness higher,\n Social adroitness is a skill of entrepreneurs called networking,\n The name of the game is the more people you know the more business\n\nyou do\n word\n\n</unclear>   and the people   who are <unclear> word\n\n</unclear> they would have known half of you by now because before they would\n\nhave been hanging in <unclear> word </unclear> saying hi nice to meet you,\n\nexchanging cards finding out who's who, seeing if they can make a deal\n\nseeing if they kind find at least one or two people here who they will be\n\nable to contact next week to be able to do some business with,\n That's networking, and that's what entrepreneurs do extremely\n\nwell,\n Uhm autonomy very high\n They're very individualistic,\n Change, very high\n They don't mind the concept of change\n In fact they relish it\n They love it,\n And harm avoidance low\n\n\nmotivated to avoid harm\n with risk taking\n is low\n too\n\nnice\n finding guts\n\n\n Entrepreneurship is fun\n It has to be fun\n If you're going into business to do some\n I could give you a hundred great business ideas, and so tomorrow\n\nyou could go out and start one of them and probably be successful\n I'll show you when I show you ideas\n I'll show you some great ideas,\n But if you don't like it if you're not going to enjoy it, then\n\nwhy do it\n If you're going to do it sixteen hours seven hours a week why do it\n\nunless it's fun,\n So there has to be a fun element\n You have to be doing something you like,\n And of course the second half of that equation is profit,\n If it's fun without profit it's a hobby,\n So if you don't have that profit motivation you won't be a good\n\nentrepreneur\n what holds a lot of\n\npeople back,\n\n\n if you ever\n When you're wearing your hat and your role is consumer when you go\n\ninto a store uh    you're   taught to be a good\n\nconsumer\n You're taught to be like a vulture\n You know, wait and see and if a store looks like it's going out\n\nof business wait till next week cos maybe they'll be fifty percent off\n con\n\n   consumer     as a customer  \n or or\n\n  or   the sales person, then you have to also play\n\nhardball too because otherwise you'll be ending up giving everything away", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

uh you've just caught me by surprise because what\n\nmost entrepreneurs do is    they    would go\n\nand  outsource that\n for example\n\n\n a\n if they're going to do their own\n\nbooks\n and\n\n  so on and so forth\n But you know what most entrepreneurs don't want to deal with\n\nfinance or accounting because they want to work with their market\n In the terms of\n\nprioritizing their time   to be

learn that\n No matter what industry you went into you could learn, uh,\n\nit over a period of time depending on how much you wanted to learn\n It's as simple as that\n\n Florist\n When I got in to be a florist I knew nothing about florists\n\n\n florist now  \n I mean now I know the traps pitfalls and everything else\n I didn't realize how dependent you were as a florist on your\n\ndesigner,\n I just figured you hired these people like you'd\n\nhire somebody, you know off the street\n Your designer is your key person\n Most people who are florists are designers, for control\n I didn't know that\n people\n\nwho didn't believe in nine to five and, efficiency and so on and so forth\n So on the days when I'd have a lot of funerals or a lot of\n\nweddings or a lot of whatever,    they'd \n\n <unclear> word </unclear> themselves <unclear> word </unclear> don't\n\nfeel  creative  today, so I'm not coming in\n And I'd say come in even if you're not very creative come in\n\n\nvibes I don't \n I'm\n\nlike  what do I do\n I don't know how to design\n where your market\n how your expertise to\n\nunderstand    what   you need and so on and so\n\nforth,\n\n Somebody else\n Sure\n\n<$ZI> \n\n<$A>  Team building\n Okay\n For when you have employees\n Mh hmm\n definitely a\n\n group  dynamics    or   the skill of being\n\nable to uh motivate people in groups    and   so on\n\n<$ZJ> \n\n<$A>  Uh okay\n Let's call it vision, like visionary I E\n call it\n\n\nseeing what everybody sees and thinking what no one has thought ,\n That type of thing\n Okay creative visionary\n Okay\n be\n\n<$ZJ> \n\n\n Ah sure,\n Ya it can be trained because in entrepreneurship one of the first\n\nthings I do in every class is to get people to be sensitive to business\n\nopportunities\n Like an entrepreneur\n when I used to have them come in to do a class\n\n<,> on the way to the classroom they'd find five business opportunities with\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>  credit \n They'd come in and say how come nobody saw that how come nobody\n\nsaw this\n\n Like every day you pass by must be a couple of dozen, business\n\nopportunities \n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A>  the next\n\nphase \n\n\nopportunity   into practice\n Then you have to do some research\n Then you have to determine whether or not the idea is feasible\n That's when you get into the research phase\n You find out if there's competition, find out if there's a\n\nniche    you know  , and then make your\n\nplan business plan in terms of how you're going to attack that niche,\n But to see or perceive the opportunity it is, a gift or a skill\n\ncos it can be developed\n So the entrepreneurs that would come into class were teaching the\n\nstudents how to be sensitive, to business opportunities \n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A>  Yes\n That's part of your research\n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A>  passion the\n\npersonality and so on and so forth\n Sure\n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A> \n\nyou're   moving ahead to idea\n\n\nenvironment for opportunities    to   take advantage\n\nof it\n You will and then you're an entrepreneur, is what you're\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> \n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n Well, why is that,\n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A>  an opportunity\n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A> \n If\n\nyou're driven   by profit alone you'll never see  \n\n the   viability to it\n\n\n have you ever regretted ah an opportunity that you didn't take advantage\n\nof that ended up being very successful\n what I'm\n\nsaying\n\n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A> \n\n\nlike this  I'm getting to determine the motivations of why you want to be\n\nin business for yourself and what you want to get out of it and so on\n are many different types\n\nof entrepreneurs\n Some people are threshold entrepreneurs and want to build a great\n\nprofit, and others are quite happy just to make a nice living where they\n\nhave a comfortable existence take care of their family that sort of thing\n it's not to say one's good\n\nand one's bad because it's just the opportunity they're looking for\n\n\nmore elusive than just finding something that would be good for now\n But what you might want to think of doing is, stepping in at a\n\nlevel, and then just to get the experience, and then you'll be\n\nworking up level by level\n Just get your feet wet a bit,\n You know you get an opportunity it may not be extravagant or it\n\nmay not be\n But don't forget if the idea is that great everybody else sees it\n\ntoo\n the\n\nbig successes come from seeing something that nobody else has seen, and\n\ntherefore you get an edge you get a, year's head-start before all of a\n\nsudden everybody realizes woo hey there's something to this,\n\n Ray Kroc's idea\n Not everybody opened up the same day as him\n\n \n Ah you know it was years later\n\n The best employee that McDonald's ever had\n,\n on all his performance appraisals\n\nexcellent employee comes in on his days off, without pay to learn the\n\nbusiness\n What a super employee\n\n\n<$A> \n\nexpect that\n If the idea is that good people are

\n It's on the map but nobody lives there\n There's no village there's nothing it's just a dot on a map so\n I think we impressed everybody by wanting to go to the dot on the\n\nmap \n So instead they

Ungava Bay this is Hudson Bay\n And uh Tasiujaq is the second little village uh like a hundred and\n\ntwenty people,\n Pretty small guys\n\n Uhm and we were there for one year, and at the end of that year\n\nuhm <unclear> word </unclear> people village and it's the largest, Inuit\n\nvillage that, uhm is in Quebec that's well in Northern Quebec basically\n Uhm Kuujjuaq is bigger, over here\n It's the sort of big, uhm, administrative centre and\n\neverything, and you'll see it in the news every so often\n If you ever see anything to do with Northern Quebec nine out of ten\n\nit's either Kuujjuaq or you will have heard of Great Whale  <unclear>\n\ntwo words </unclear>  because of the hydro project\n That's where they've chosen to do the hydro project,\n So that's sometimes in the news as well\n Uh Kuujjuaq is bigger than Inukjuak it's got a thousand seven\n\nhundred people roughly but it's pretty much, uhm, it's not really\n\ndivided three ways, it's almost fifty-fifty white, or southern\n\nsoutherner however\n call white\n\npeople even if we're not white kind of in the north like,\n We had a Jamaican teacher who thought it was the funniest thing to\n\nbe called a white

and then when we moved over to Inukjuak we were, spoiled\n cos you\n\nhave pretty much single level classes and I taught grade six and, grade\n\nseven so\n word\n\n</unclear> and the <unclear>  women    thinking \n\n</unclear> cos they go from me to him\n Worked really well\n It was really nice\n still up\n\nthere this year teaching grade seven but I think it's his last year,\n Little wonders in grade seven,\n starts\n\nspeaking very softly  grade seven that's    going to\n\n  be real hard <unclear> two words </unclear> grade seven \n we need clientele and that\n\nthey're all, <unclear>  ninety  </unclear> point nine percent\n\nInuit children and so their mother tongue is Inuktitut,\n And when they come to us they come to English in grade three,\n they do\n\nall their content   subjects in English\n They still have Inuktitut uhm\n they have it\n\neveryday <unclear> word </unclear>\n But it's slowly, sort of, filters down to about three times a\n\nweek,\n And they have culture class which is usually a morning or an\n\nafternoon every week    that's in Inuktitut \n\n and the girls, sew and the guys hunt \n\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A> , They probably wouldn't take choice\n\n\nsometimes, like the girls will go out fishing and stuff and like they will\n\ndo things together but, they probably wouldn't also, pick either option\n\n<$A>  to do that\n\n<$ZD> \n\n\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  and every year\n Now, uhm, some of the things I say are also village-peculiar\n\n<,> but    all villages   have some\n\nsort of budget to go on well not big trips like outdoor trips\n And when we were in Inukjuak every year we went out uhm in the\n\nspring,\n Either with the older kids on a camping trip and the younger kids\n\nwould go for a day fishing trip\n\n\n <unclear> word </unclear> village they've got it's <unclear>  </unclear>,\n It's great fun\n That was a lot of fun\n\n\ncould be seventh grade ,\n And so yeah you can join in\n\n\nat one   during those   well the three periods of culture a\n\nweek that are nice big <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n\ndo is go out of town   all week  and   this is \n\n  your      kind of \n\n time that you have to do other things but\n But if you wanted to join in and wanted to go down and see what\n\nthey're doing that wouldn't be a problem except that they are doing <unclear>\n\nthree words </unclear> so, uhm sometimes\n Like all the culture teachers are elders in the village and they\n\nspeak no English so maybe they understand a bit but   \n\nthey   couldn't tell you what you're doing basically\n So if you've got a lower grade, you have to rely on your kids to\n\ntell you what they're doing\n It can be a bit difficult but\n\n<$ZE> \n\n<$A> \n\n to   join in and find out about what's going on, \n we're not\n\n  really teaching we are teaching a second language but we are\n\nteaching everything in a second language,\n\n\nnot really E S L\n We always come up with an appropriate name\n E S L and everybody has a\n\ndifferent term for it\n Like right now the board trying to come up with a good political\n\nterm to use <unclear> word </unclear>\n Uhm, so that means that, should\n\n You'll have to teach math and science and well depending on what\n\nuhm, grade levels you're looking at\n In primary you teach math science social studies English, uhm\n\n<,> art  you can teach\n Well that all depends\n Some people really think that's a great idea and then people freak\n\n\n\n\n  if you're   in a small village be asked to teach gym as well\n\n<,> but that's not so bad\n basically what all you\n\nteach\n In secondary it breaks down to science becomes things like ecology\n Uhm, social studies gets sort of broken down into history\n\ngeography but they're lumped in together\n physics

There is\n Sometimes it's not uhm necessarily a favourable difference\n Like theoretically you can think that oh well a parent who's gone\n\nthrough either the federal system or the residential school

bad experiences and they tend to think that their\n\nidea of school    is   not a good one uhm,\n\n\nthey   understand that there is a value to school they don't\n\nunderstand how the system works necessarily    they're not really   able to help in any way but\n No most certainly the likelihood of any parent being able to help\n\nwith homework, is very very very unlikely that you'll find parents    that   can do that\n are willing to do that cos they\n\ndon't necessarily know that it's something that would be good to do\n Let's just\n\nthrow that on the floor \n\n\nyou have   children have   very old parents\n\n\nand   and   you think, is this that woman's child \n It's just not biologically possible\n Uhm adoption is a very, different thing in the north\n it's between\n\nnorthern

a problem\n It's not considered something bad or something, stigmatic\n There's nothing stigmatic about it\n If she decides to keep the baby that's fine\n\n\nfeel she, wants to be bothered about it the mother will adopt it    or   the grandmother might or another family in the\n\nvillage\n usually keeps within\n\nfamily    the   child will stay in the family but\n\nsometimes    they'll   be adopted to another family\n\nor\n mm these\n\nparents who are definitely grandparent age you know  if not\n\ngreat-grandparent age who have these like really young children\n So it's kind of an interesting thing\n It certainly makes for interesting translation of report card\n and try and\n\nexplain, what social studies are \n\n Report cards are a lot of fun\n In the smaller communities you go around to the houses and you\n\nvisit and that's just great that's uhh\n You really get to know people\n Even in the big communities\n is a little\n\ndifferent but in Inukjuak where    I can   honestly\n\nsay I don't know everybody in the village and I've lived there three years\n\n<,> you still get to know families    of\n\nyour children   and you know\n know\n\nwhat the household

difficult, thing\n we're\n\n  viewed as people who are coming to give them a service, to do\n\nsomething and they really appreciate that we're coming to do that but getting\n\ninvolved in their

human\n\nbeing but also as a teacher you have a legal obligation   \n\nto   try and do something\n So you have to go through the sort of proper channels of the\n\nprincipal and\n In every school

at\n\nthat cos it costs them zero\n So when Ben and Jerry's was growing and they got to this stage\n\nhere, and they started to lose money, because Ben and Jerry were still\n\nrunning it, and the

the\n\nearliest things that we've got in the gallery\n This was painted, about thirteen twenty,\n It's uhm, on wood,\n hundreds\n\n were uh on wood panels\n to be part of a triptych ah ah a\n\nthree, part, probably a devotional piece\n Probably a private devotional piece\n This would have been\n The left hand side there would have been ah ah a middle one,\n\nsomewhat larger\n That was a mother and

wouldn't\n\nhave put a landscape in there or anything to distract\n this is a religious painting you were supposed to\n\nconcentrate    uhm on the   figure\n Who was St Catherine of Alexandria\n that day,\n\nthirteen twenty would have known right away that this was St Catherine,\n\nbecause uhm    they   hid, uh in religious\n\npaintings    and   they're not only in <unclear>\n\nword </unclear> ones some later ones, uhm have got clues in them,\n Attributes shown along with the saint that tell you who they are\n And so Catherine's attribute is a wheel because she was uhm,\n\nput to death or they attempted to put her to death on the wheel\n\n\nand  rather nasty, results\n\n\nshe   in the end she   was  beheaded \n But the wheel is the attribute of St Catherine\n you see a picture of St Catherine you'll find\n\na wheel in it\n Uh sometimes on the ground\n Sometimes she's holding it\n\n in\n\n  the <unclear> word </unclear>\n Also to indicate that she was beheaded she has, a sword in her\n\nhand here\n She's got her hand around the top of a sword\n And she has a pen to indicate that she was an author\n So you see you've got all kinds of clues\n They would also have known that she was, uhm from a wealthy\n\nfamily by her clothing\n By her halo you could tell she was a religious person\n\n\n uhm, could be    there  quite easily  \n\n uh, uh in   the days that uhm    that \n\n Simone di Martini was painting\n But it's typical Simone di Martini\n It's typical Siennese in the beautiful, elegant line of the\n\nSiennese\n so\n\ninterested in modern,  inviting \n the use of

or you want to make any comments go\n\nahead any time you want,\n if\n\n  we're to get around here in an hour uhm we really have to keep\n\nmoving,\n Another Italian painting, uhm of the Italian Renaissance by\n\nPiero di Cosimo\n Uh and it is the Italian Renaissance and there are a number of\n\nthings about it that indicate that this    is  \n\nreally what the Renaissance was about\n subject of it is Vulcan and\n\nAeolus\n Vulcan here with uh the sword\n\n\n   god   of fire  \n Aeolus was the god of the winds\n huge\n\npair of bellows making the wind that keeps the fire going,\n Uhm the reference, is to uhm, first of all mythological,\n\nfigures\n gods\n And this is what the Renaissance was about\n Going back to Greek and going back to Greek mythology going back to\n\nthe early days\n Uhm as was the importance of the human being, Humanism\n Uhm and, the beginning of Man as the important thing\n The beginning of civilization uh which was seen, to begin when\n\nman got control of fire\n\n\nsomething that happened but you couldn't control it and it was usually\n\ndestructive\n brought fire to man and man\n\ncould use it for his own uses to cook with\n And here he's shown making horseshoes\n And so with that comes civilization\n And people began to tame animals\n Uh they begin to build houses\n They begin to live in family units\n\n\nsociety    and   this is another focus    of   the Renaissance\n Uhm under that is a chest\n It's called a cassone chest\n That's the Italian word\n sort of\n\nlike a hope chest,\n\n\n  their   uh belongings into\n a\n\nplace to sit    as a   place to put things\n is not\n\nbecause they want to demonstrate a cassone chest but it is here to inform\n\nthese two, paintings over here,\n Two little paintings done by uh Filipino Lippi, who was an\n\nItalian Renaissance painter working probably in the workshop of Botticelli\n And these paintings when they were made they're not made to hang\n\non the wall in a  sense  like you see them here\n They were made to go on a cassone chest\n And cassone chests were, uhm very often decorated with three\n\npaintings\n And you read it, well in a series\n read\n\nit   starting over there on the left end\n That would be the first part of the story\n Then a big painting across the front\n And then the denouemount, would be uh on this end here\n And so these are two that were commissioned by an Italian family\n\n\nJewish biblical heroine\n And the other one was the story of Mordecai\n woman's\n\n       the   bride's  \n\nchest and Mordecai on the groom's chest,\n\n\nEsther    Bottecelli did not do the   painting\n Or it's not known exactly whether he did or not but it's thought\n\n<,> that he probably turned it over to Filipino Lippi who was, one of his\n\nstar pupils and who did a lot of these cassone chests\n So you see Esther, uhm approaching the palace\n Uh the king has sent for a number of young women to come in\n He's going to pick a new wife,\n And that is the one in the far end\n And the big one here which is in France, shows the king with\n\nthe women assembled who does pick Esther\n And the one on the end which is in the Horne Museum in Florence\n\nshows her leaving,\n typically,\n\nItalian Renaissance in the grace uhm the beauty the elegance of the form uhm\n\nthe way she's, seen approaching the castle but, hesitant about it\n\nbecause she doesn't know what's    going to  \n\nhappen and what she's getting into\n is\n\nindicated by, the way her foot is dragging and the way her dress is sort\n\nof dragging not coming along\n And this is echoed by the tree here\n The shape of the tree, you see it has the same graceful shape\n\nthe same lines as she has with a little bit       that     suggests here  the  shrubberies here\n was one of the first uses\n\nof landscape in the picture\n\n\n\n And it supported, the main figure\n\n\nto uh the the      and   \n\n the colours    and   the rendition uh that was\n\ntypically Renaissance\n The other one is Mordecai\n This was a groom's chest\n And this tells another story\n Mordecai on the first panel comes to Esther and tells her that the\n\nking has issued an edict saying that all Jews will be put to death\n And she is Jewish but the king does not know it, which seems\n\nto me to be a peculiar part of the story but anyway\n Uhm, this is in the Book of Esther,\n Uh he says to her come and talk to him and see if you can, talk\n\nhim out of this\n It's as much as her life is worth to go into the presence of the\n\nking without being summoned, and so she hesitates\n She doesn't know what to do but in the end she decides that she\n\nmust risk her own life to try to free her people\n She goes\n\n\nshowing   her coming into the presence of the king\n She talks the king out of his edict\n And this is the final one, where you see Mordecai coming out of\n\nthe castle, and, the horse is being led by Haman who is the man who,\n\nproposed the edict in the first place and he's now, reduced to the\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> of the groom and leading Mordecai's horse\n\n The horse is prancing\n seems to me as\n\nthough the horse is laughing,\n these are\n\n  the stories\n This is the kind of art that was being done at that time\n gives us another idea\n\n   of   art and what art was used for    you know when you   can see a cassone chest and know \n\n  uh, that   that was used uhm   , to uh   decorate the chests", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '0e86fbcf-ffef-48fa-a691-56a466ae9c4b', 'added':

know always question the activity, that you're working with\n\n<,> you know\n a\n\npart of class management\n trying\n\n   to   say is that, you will always have\n\ndiscipline problems\n And you have to deal with the discipline problems\n uhm, student that\n\nyou have, okay, a student who is hyperactive\n have to deal with\n\nthat student, for the rest of the year\n have to find\n\nways, to deal with that student,\n have to, you\n\nknow\n You have no choice,\n\n\nis  ,  a   big problem today in teaching, in my\n\n<,> opinion is that, a lot of, teachers think they have a choice,\n\nand that choice is to do nothing, but that's not a choice cos you're just\n\n   going to   have more discipline problems\n\n\nmany many many more discipline problems, than if you  take it\n\n<,,> head-on, and you think about it, you know\n And you try to find solutions\n I think, discipline problems the worst discipline problems,\n\nturn into solutions,\n The kids that you'll have the problems with, could

like a class can have a positive energy\n has\n\nto deal with  ,  in   uh\n\nteaching what class management has to do is how you're going to control,\n\nor, manipulate that energy to  make it into a positive energy\n A learning energy,\n Your, goal is always learning\n So, you have to think of ways to do that, okay\n And that has a lot to do with motivation, okay\n How you're going to motivate your students,\n And, what I'm trying to tell you is you have your first part\n\nwhich is, very traditional teaching, and then you have to start,\n\nlearning, how to motivate your students and to make your class more\n\ninteresting\n Cos the traditional will not work that long, right\n You know what I mean\n\n\n You  \n You know how long you do vocabulary, you know what I mean\n\nbefore they catch

{'text': '<$A>  Okay I\'ve come today to speak to you essentially about TESL and\n\n<,> the community and, job opportunities in the greater Montreal area,\n Uh I\'d like to begin by discussing my personal experience in,\n\nTESL a little bit,\n Uh I began I guess, considering teaching as an option in my life\n\n<,> about, three and a half years ago,\n I was in a dead end job uh with an incomplete B A in English\n\nliterature,\n Uh I had a, family which had, just began\n My daughter was uh, just a month old or so,\n And I was, investigating the possibilities of becoming a teacher\n I\n\nhad   some counselling uh career orientation counselling\n And I had pretty much fixed my idea on becoming a teacher,\n Except of course I had a family and a job and it\'s sometimes\n\ndifficult to  separate yourself  from\n\n<,> that stable income to, uh launch yourself into another career,\n Well, I guess, destiny, kind of helped me along because\n\n<,> it was the beginning of a, major recession and uh being the last in I\n\n<,> quickly became the first out \n I found myself on unemployment\n Uh no B A nothing and I decided to join, Concordia and the TESL\n\ndepartment,\n The way in wasn\'t that easy,\n Uh it\'s a very difficult program to get into\n They have very high expectations for you, and uh they have very\n\nhigh demands about your qualities, coming into the program,\n Uh I ended up in the philosophy program here,\n And I still have a year to do to get a B A in philosophy at\n\nConcordia but uh\n I after one session there proving myself to be an exceptional\n\nstudent I, was accepted into the, TESL program,\n in\n\n  uh terms of pre while and post\n, uh\n\n the   joke with that\n Uhm, I\'ve already described my pre-TESL life and uh, now I\'d\n\nlike to describe the, while in the program,\n\n\n  preparation   for both a profession,\n\nand a vocation\n Uh teaching is, a mix of both science and, art,\n You have to be prepared to\n\nbe uh  , artistic in the design of activities and the way you\n\nimplement material\n But you also have to be a scientist in the sense that you must\n\nobserve group behaviour you must observe individual behaviour\n\n\nuhm,  evaluate individuals and you must do this objectively\n So there\'s a very scientific aspect to teaching,\n Uh I think, the, TESL program provides you with I call the\n\nfive Ps\n that is very\n\nbalanced  , between learning theory, language learning and\n\nlinguistics,\n Uhm and it\'s getting better\n Next year there\'s a new four year program being implemented,\n\nwhich will augment the number of, practice hours and I imagine also\n\nmethodology and, the courses will be expanded,\n Uh I think the second " P " for TESL is people,\n The people at uh two levels\n The staff and the students\n The staff, uh in the TESL department are leaders in their fields\n And they are, leaders in the research of, language learning\n\nand language teaching,\n The people who teach in TESL are quality teachers and uh who,\n\nsincerely care and are concerend about your, future,\n Uhm the students are heterogeneous in the sense that we have\n\nstudents from all over the world, uh with many, different experiences\n\nand varied backgrounds,\n And uh they\'re all very interesting and intelligent people to work\n\nwith,\n Uh TESL program also gives you the practice you need, uh to\n\nbecome a teacher,\n Uh it\'s not an easy profession and, TESL itself applies to many\n\ndifferent levels and we get that experience\n We teach adults,\n We teach at the secondary level and we teach at the primary level\n Uh we had in my time a hundred and fifty hours of, practice\n\nteaching and this will be soon seven hundred hours with the new program which\n\nuh, I think is, adequate\n I think a hundred and fifty hours was, just a\n\ndrop in the bucket in terms of TESL experience\n And uh, you have the chance to practice, creating materials\n\n<,> creating lessons, being a creative teacher,\n There\'s also a lot of progress you, witness in TESL you progress\n\npersonally, and uh professionally,\n And finally I think, TESL gives you a perspective on teaching\n\n<,>\n The role of the teacher,\n The role of the student,\n And on language learning,\n And all this comes out to opportunity\n And there is a lot of opportunity in Quebec for TESL, people,\n Uh there\'s private schools for both adults and young people camps\n\n<,> things like that,\n The cegep programs are expanding\n Uh which in turn means the secondary school programs are expanding\n\n<,>\n Uh there\'s even work in publishing and sales in Quebec\n There\'s a lot of, publishing of uh, English language learning\n\nmaterials here,\n Uh in the public system, and the school commissions, there\'s\n\nthe primary level we are, uh trained to teach at both primary and\n\nsecondary and we are given a certificate in which we can, teach at both\n\nprimary and secondary,\n And there\'s a lot of adult teaching as well in uh the school\n\ncommissions\n there\'s going to be even\n\nan expansion at that level  \n the effects of the last election I think English\n\nwill only become more important to, the, people of Quebec,\n Uhm, how do you get a job though once you come out of a program\n You, come out of a program you\'ve been, provided with a\n\ncertain number of skills and techniques, about teaching,\n You\'re provided with a certain amount of, theory about teaching\n\n<,>\n But that doesn\'t help you get a job,\n And uh, that\'s I guess the big uh, obstacle\n\nonce you finish your program,\n I think, though, that, TESL also\n\nprovides you an opportunity to network yourself,\n When you\'re doing practice teaching sessions you get to know the\n\npeople  at  the school,\n You try to contact uh these people afterwards about supply teaching\n Uhm, you have to send out C Vs and a lot of them\n money\n but you send,\n\ngood quality C Vs in French with letters of reference from professors and uh\n\n<,> uh cooperating teachers,\n,\n\n of your uh education  ,\n It takes time before you get your B Ed\n It takes time before you get your certificate or your permit from\n\nthe Ministry of Education,\n Get the documents from Concordia\n They can provide you with certain documents that will help you get\n\na job,\n And provide a good cover letter in, French\n You\'re dealing with a French school commission\n You have to demonstrate a certain ability to communicate in French\n\n<,>\n\n\n  to   translate a letter for you,\n Get that first step in the door\n They think you can speak French,\n Good, that\'s the first step,\n Uh you\'ll end up, going through interview processes where uh\n\nfive people are interviewing you uh,\n School principals\n The heads of school commissions\n The heads of uh the human resources department,\n Are all flinging questions at you in both English and French for\n\nabout thirty minutes of time,\n You have to be able to switch languages, quickly and efficiently\n\n<,>\n And finally if you get through all that you may even have to take a\n\nFrench exam,\n And uh that\'s another thing you should prepare yourself for,\n Uh you should prepare yourself for in advance\n Uh the French demands vary,\n I know that if you want to teach in Montreal with the uh Catholic\n\nschool board here,\n a\n\nnative speaker\n Other school boards have special tests for, the English teachers\n\nwhich have been, reduced in uh expectations\n Uhm, I, was, very lucky\n Uh since I left Concordia I\'ve had many job opportunities many job\n\noffers,\n Uhm, I went through three interview processes\n I was selected in two of them,\n One of them was uh a little far from Montreal in uh a small town\n\ncalled  Bellingham  near  Gaul , where they asked me to\n\nteach, primary in grades four five and six in, three different schools\n\n<,>\n the primary level you\'re often\n\nteaching in, more than one school,\n verbally accepted the job\n\nbut no contract was signed fortunately, because shortly thereafter I had\n\nanother interview and I was selected to teach uh secondary school here,\n\nclose to Montreal in Repentigny,\n L\'école secondaire\n\n Jean-d-Aulps,\n Uh, it\'s, a big school,\n It\'s uh,\n Although the uh, principal said we\'re not allowed to use those\n\nwords about our school \n It\'s not big\n It\'s not large,\n It only has two thousand six hundred students,\n Uh, in, the second cycle of secondary\n So we\'re talking about secondary three four and five only,\n Uh we have twelve hundred students in secondary three\n Five hundred and fifty in secondary four,\n Four hundred and fifty in secondary five and,\n Four hundred students, uh following individual uh educational\n\nprograms,\n Uh you can see then, the school itself, is a community,\n The size of our schools in Quebec especially at the secondary\n\nlevel, uh it\'s not uncommon to find schools of at least two thousand\n\nstudents,\n social\n\n  network a whole community in itself,\n\n\nthe staff itself  ,  is   two hundred people\n We have a hundred and sixty teachers,\n We have five vice principals\n We have two psychologists,\n And at least another fifty professionals and support staff,\n As a teacher, you teach, probably four five six different\n\ngroups\n So you\'re dealing with a hundred and eighty, individuals on a\n\ndaily basis,\n I can\'t say that I\'ve had a great deal, of experience,\n\nteaching I\'ve only, maybe taught in a high school for ten weeks of time\n\n<,> but it\'s amazing what you see in those ten weeks,\n Uh I\'ve seen both positive things and, negative things\n And I use that word, carefully,\n Uhm, on the negative side I\'ve, been through bomb scares\n\n<,> riots, stories of suicide, drugs and alcohol, pregnancy,\n\nincest, psychological abuse, and just general disrespect for adults\n\nand authority\n On the other side, on the positive side, when you work in a\n\nschool of this size you really feel that, there is a sense of community\n\n<,>\n This is a community in itself\n There\'s also a sense of care that, all the staff members,\n\nhave for the students and for their, success\n We all desire the same thing that our students succeed,\n Uh, there\'s team work spirit, idealism, again on the part\n\nof the staff but also on the    part of\n\nthe students  ,\n There\'s a tendency in teaching to focus in, on the three\n\nstudents in the back who are creating the problems in your classroom, but\n\ndon\'t forget about the other twenty-five who are there for a reason and who\n\nwant to learn,\n There\'s also the one-on-one relationships you have with,\n\nstudents,\n Uh, their vision is sometimes naive\n But, it\'s very heart-warming sometimes to see that naivety and\n\nthat idealism,\n Uh and just the contact you have with students\n I walk down the hallway near the cafeteria at lunch, and I\'m\n\ngreeted fifteen times in the space of five minutes,\n And that\'s a good feeling as a person\n\n\n, experience in the school,\n,\n\n overcome   the positive side\n But, when you\'re dealing with such a large number of people\n\nyou\'re dealing with a real cross-section of society and, those things that\n\nyou see on the news once a week or twice a week, uh become, real, to\n\nyou', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

also did a number of uhm erotic nudes,\n Uh he was ah a close friend of Luther,\n\n\nReformation\n Uh they were close family friends\n They were godfathers to each other's children\n And, uhm sometimes that when you think of that it seems rather\n\nsurprising that Cranach would have done, uh so many, nudes but it's\n\nthought that it was one of the Electors of Saxony, where he was working\n\nwho had a taste for these, nudes and was commissioning the work on  it\n painting them\n\nto please him\n one is called Venus,\n They're Venus\n They're, uh Diana\n They're uh, Eve\n have

when the Gallery  bought  her, \n\n  the   painting\n And it was obvious that it had been put there, not by Cranach\n\nbut many years thereafter    at the order   no doubt\n\nof the subsequent uh owner,\n And after a lot of, uh thought and research and examination\n\nthey decided that it would be safe to remove it\n theory with conservation is if\n\n<,> something is known not to be of the

counter-Reformation\n After Luther, uh objected to the Catholic Church and some of\n\nwhat he says the excesses of the Catholic Church and uhm brought about the\n\nReformation which led to Protestantism, the Catholic Church,    organized   a counter-Reformation   , uh    to     sort of fight back\n\n<,> and re-establish themselves\n And one of the most powerful tools they had was art, because art\n\nappeals to the intellect it appeals to the senses it appeals to the emotions\n\nit can tell a story,\n And so, the Popes of this time, were great art patrons\n And each Pope had, at least one artist, uh that he uh gave\n\ncommissions to and    that   did his work and the\n\nkind of work\n And the one I'd like to look at is uh Bernini the great Italian\n\nsculptor uh    uh whose   patron was Pope Urban\n\nthe Eighth\n had worked together\n\n<,> before he became Pope and after that    they uh\n\n    , did   the work  \n\n that   Urban always wanted\n, the\n\n  sculptor that did, most of the, or many, of the fountains\n\n<,> in Rome \n\n<$A>  Have you, ever been to Rome\n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n the   fountains in Piazza Navona and so on, these are done by\n\nBernini\n in St\n\nPeter's    at the   altar\n\nthe  baldachin  and the great, curved, pillars  \n\n uh that   hold    the  , canopy over\n\nthe altar\n\n This is uhm, uhm, scuplture a portrait of the Pope,\n\ncommissioned by the Pope, uh over life-size, very impressive but not\n\nat all formal\n\n\n very    informal   almost    to the   point of being casual\n not dressed up in, papal\n\nregalia\n He's got uhm ah a little cap on\n\n\n\n<,> his   uhm, cape\n Uhm Bernini is demonstrating how he can, use the marble and\n\nthe carving of the marble to catch the light, uh and, to, almost\n\nmake flesh look real\n certain angle here\n\nwith the light on that brown on the nose it looks almost    like   flesh\n Uhm, he's put in wrinkles around the eyes\n He's put in wrinkles around the mouth\n It's not idealized at all\n It's not making the Pope look as good as he could\n that\n\nthis    uh, is   what the Pope really looked like\n\nand what he\n Since they were almost you know on a level of friendship he would\n\nbe, privileged to see him like this and this is the way  \n\n he was   depicted in,\n Uhm, one of the treasures of this gallery, uh often,\n\npicked out by people you know as being, uhm one    uh\n\nof   , the     treasures    in   the National Gallery, \n Uh let's see one other\n Let's look at this one over here for something different\n Many of the things in here most of the things I'd say are\n\nreligious, because as I pointed out   \n\nBaroque   art, uhm was uhm, to some extent a religious art\n not\n It's quite different\n This is Flemish,\n It's, called As the Old Sing So the Young Pipe and it's by the\n\nFlemish, uh painter, uhm Jacob Jordaens, done about sixteen forty\n\n<,,>\n Now this is a painting that can be looked at and enjoyed on\n\nseveral levels\n On the face of it uhh what you see is uhm, a family, uh\n\nsitting around a table enjoying themselves eating drinking\n might be called a genre\n\n<,,> painting, people in their own home\n\n\npeople

{'text': '<$A>  So there\'s that level you can look at it on\n At, that time though if you had looked at this painting if you\n\nlooked it all over, uhm your eye would    light\n\n  up here in this niche, and you would realize this was a\n\n vanitas , or a  memento mori \n These are, two terms that are that are used to describe a\n\npainting that    is   really ah a reminder of death\n That\'s what it is about\n And you see these things\n You see them in uh, uhm\n There\'s often a skull\n vanitas\n\n symbol\n symbol\n are are\n\n  are   fresh today but they\'re    going\n\nto   wilt and die tomorrow\n Often there are a couple of flowers, that have already fallen\n\nor some insects that are in the flowers\n, pages up there,\n\nuh are an indication of this idea\n the\n\nmessage is   no matter how great your learning is no matter how\n\nwell-read you are,    we\'re   all going to come\n\nto the same end\n this moral message\n\n   that   is there\n There\'s also a political message, and that is, partly in this\n\n<,> music that the old lady is holding, partly probably in this jester up\n\nhere who is the artist\n It\'s s self-portrait of the artist\n And he\'s pointing, to three birds that are caged\n And this all refers to the political situation,\n Uh Flanders was under the yoke of Spain\n Flanders was Protestant\n\n\nof   of   Spain uhh but uh uhh were not\n And this refers to a Huguenot, song\n Uh I\'m not just sure what the reference is but some sort of song\n\nthat the soldiers sang,\n This up here, probably, is a reminder that, uhm, these\n\nbirds are singing, but they\'re in a cage\n You people are having a good time you\'re eating and drinking and\n\nhaving music but    you\'re   caged\n You\'re not free\n a lot\n a lot more in the\n\npainting\n It\'s chucked full of symbolism ***YES: CHUCKED***\n I\'m not going to go into it cos we don\'t have time,\n Okay\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  I think what stands out about it are the colours, uh in it\n some of us\n\nthought  that   it had just been cleaned, but it hadn\'t\n is due to\n\nthe fact that Reni used uhm, white undercoat\n,\n\nwould   start from a dark, uh underpainting and paint up from\n\nthat\n\n\nwhite glows through,    uh the   draperies and\n\nthe flesh and everything and it\'s uh\n\n\nJupiter The Rape of Europa \n\n<$A> \n\n   one     one   of\n\nRembrandt\'s fine works,\n And this, also is Esther probably\n It\'s never been clear who she is\n she\n\n    it   was called The Jewish Bride\n Then it was uh, called Susanna\n It\'s now, hailing from the Old Testament uh Esther or Bathsheba\n there are reasons, to think that it\'s not\n\nBathsheba\n are reasons to\n I\n\n  I   think the current, uhm idea among most people is\n\nthat this is Esther\n The same Esther that we saw out there, going to the king\n And that this is the moment when she has made up her mind that\n\nshe\'s going to go to the king, risk her life and  \n\n ask  , that he uh, lift this edict\n Uh the Bible says that she spent three days in fasting and uh\n\nwhatever and then she got herself, dressed into  a fine garment \n\nand she had a handmaiden, uh do her hair, uh    and\n\n  off she went\n thought that this is the\n\nmoment that\'s pictured here\n She\'s dressed in her velvet and, with the gold trim and the\n\nbeautiful\n And it gives Rembrandt you know the opportunity, to paint this\n\nlight uhm    the   contrast with the dark that\n\nhe always has the dark background and then the light coming in from the left\n\nto pick up what he wants you to see\n\n\nand      the    dips  of her dress\n\nand particularly this hand, because she\'s going through a great, deal\n\nof inner turmoil\n this\n\n  this   uh decision that she is in the process of making \n\n  and   how, upsetting the whole thing is\n Uhm, because Rembrandt is coming up to the period where he\'s\n\ngoing to do,    the psychological\n\n  content, in his paintings\n\n\n a lot of psychological penetration    in   uh\n\n   the   paintings and the portraits that he does\n And so, in her face, you see some of this hesitation and this\n\n<,,> indecision\n Uhm as you look at it you see more and more coming out of the\n\nbackground as you usually do\n\n Papers here that are\n accept\n\nthis as Esther, the papers would be the edict that the king    has   signed,\n her\n Now this is something I didn\'t mention in the other room but this\n\nis another one of these  vanitas  symbols\n The ages of life\n In there there was an baby a young woman and an old woman\n vanitas\n\n thing\n as the baby\n\n    is it will grow older    and  \n\nit will grow old\n\n\n combination a young woman    and   the old\n\nface in the background that\'s probably    a  \n\n vanitas \n And the emphasis on the hand here because, the important thing\n\nabout that woman is that she\'s doing Esther\'s hair\n It\'s the hand that\'s important\n\n\nRembrandt  puts into a painting but\n\nahh,\n But just makes it uh, so superb\n And more Dutch paintings in this room\n Another one here by Nicolaes Maes, who was a pupil of\n\nRembrandt\'s\n A woman making lace\n\n\n   a      a, Dutch  \n\n , uh housewife who is very, uh frugal\n Her money bags are here\n Her books are open\n She\'s making lace\n She\'s making money\n all uh\n coming in\n\nfrom the left to pick up, the woman and the books the kinds of things that\n\nyou\'re supposed   , to   concentrate on\n landscapes here\n\nof <unclear> word </unclear>, with those great, skies the cloudscapes\n\nthat the seventeenth century Dutch, did and that influenced, uhm,\n\noh, people    Impressionists   uh uh\n\nproto-Impressionists,\n skies\n\nlike that\n\n\n<$A>  And we have Canaletto here\n We have a Guardi over there\n We have a couple Bellottos,\n These people were known as View painters,\n They did views of Venice\n This was the time of the Grand Tour, when the sons of the\n\nwealthy, uhm particularly British wealthy went off on extended trips after\n\ntheir education\n Went all through Europe\n Uhm it was the, beginning of tourism when other people were\n\ntraveling\n Venice was always a place uh that people wanted to go because of\n\nthe atmosphere because of the water because of the buildings\n And, they wanted, souvenirs like modern tourists do and so\n\neh ah    a   whole, occupation, almost came\n\ninto being providing these       view   scenes  \n Ah Canaletto was the most popular of them\n ones\n Uh he also did small ones that people could take\n\n\n\n So, I think, when you go into that transition, okay I\'m\n\njust    going to  , finish up with these\n\nlittle points here\n go into that\n\ntransition, from traditional teaching, to know the rules of the game\n\n<,> okay we start teaching know what it\'s, into,    uh,  the, communicative\n\n  approach, cooperative learning at these, very fascinating\n\nthese reasons that make you interested in E S L because it is fascinating you\n\nknow\n dynamic,\n get into\n\nthat, compared to the old traditional style,\n\n\n transition    \n You have to do it only once, you have the traditional,\n\nteaching in place,\n You understand what I mean,\n It is only when it works, in your class, that the discipline\n\nproblems, uh the big you know    class\n\nmanagement      is   settled, that you\n\nwill be able to start, uh,    going more \n\n

that\'s it,\n And then we\'ll start doing other activities\n We\'ll start working on other activities\n some other class with\n\nwords missing you know the old the words missing in the song  and they\n\nhave to listen to the song\n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A>  And then, that\'s it for that,\n And then we\'ll just sing,\n And then I might do something else where I take the song and now\n\nwe\'re    going

<unclear> word </unclear> small groups\n\n\nconceivably end up with a class at three levels but you have no more than\n\ntwelve kids,\n So that's a big thing and\n\n<$ZS> \n\n<$A>  question\n\n<$ZR> \n\n<$A>  Mmm not really\n Well, uhm my first experience was in like I say in a small\n\ncommunity and their exposure to English was so limited\n one\n\nT V station so the only English they were hearing were from the five southern\n\nteachers who were there and actually that's not true because two of the\n\nprimary    one of them   was French so four\n\nsouthern teachers and the nurse\n No he was French\n you know the only English they\n\never heard was in school so I mean that's not a heck of a lot of exposure\n\n\nkind of   scared me my first day I go in there you know\n The first day is always the worst day in the world no matter how\n\nmany, times you do it too \n The first day of the year is always bad\n You don't know the kids and uhm go and ask them questions so what\n\ndid you do this summer you know or anything\n And this sea of little faces just stares back at you\n\n Nobody even tries\n\n\ngroan \n They don't talk a lot either so it's like kind of a cultural thing\n First start at the\n be leaping\n\ngoing oh oh oh yes \n You know\n The day you see that call me\n laugh\n\nends \n That never happens\n And so, when they all sort of have varying language skills it's\n\nalmost hard to find out whether they do or not because it's really hard to\n\npull it out\n didn't talk\n\na whole lot and so I found out that I had great expectations and all sorts of\n\nideas of stuff that I'd been doing that, really rapidly got cut down to\n\nsize\n And, that's one of the things that you find no matter where you\n\ngo\n\n\nwith   <unclear> word </unclear> in Inukjuak and I had fourteen\n\nstudents, one level\n\n\njust   floored they were just so completely different than the other\n\nkids\n did English in grade three but\n\nthey'd had consistent one level classes    and  \n\nconsistent teachers    probably   like    two of   their teachers, uhm had been in this\n\nvillage for like at that time three or four years so they already had a very\n\ngood command of what they were doing and you could tell like we used to\n\nalways say well like we know the kids that had gone   \n\nfrom    Mabel  to  Sandy  or  Sandy  to \n\nMabel  they switched levels at one point but\n You could tell that these kids had gone through these teachers cos\n\nthey were very very good teachers and they had a really really solid base\n And there's no doubt in our mind it was these two teachers that had\n\nmade a difference, for these kids\n Uhm and so they they could talk up a storm if they had the desire\n\nto    do   that\n but\n\n\n English\n, lower than,\n\n\n a long way to go\n And I think we haven't challenged them necessarily enough along the\n\nway\n\n\n  want to   you know upset them and we don't want\n\nthem to think they can't do it    kind of   thing\n\nso uhm go a little under <unclear> two words </unclear>,\n\n I'm sure my colleagues would disagree with me on that one and\n\ncertain <unclear> word </unclear> \n I feel they should be reading\n\n The other thing that happens is the longer you're there is the\n\neasier it gets and this is probably true wherever you would go but, once\n\nyou've taught the same level more than once, then,\n\n It's like you've got it nailed by that time and you can do all\n\nthese things that you've dreamt of doing before but    you\n\n  didn't have the energy to pull off\n Cos it takes a lot of energy,\n It takes a lot of energy to be on every day all day\n you have to really, really\n\nreally be on the ball\n And nobody ever seems to ever get sick because there's never any\n\nsubstitutes\n So you go in if you're dying because you don't really you know you\n\ndon't know what they're    going to   do if they\n They cancel school if they can't find a substitute for the kids\n going to\n\n  have a day off which  may or may not be a good thing\n\n depending on    how   things have\n\nbeen going they may want a break they may want to take a little pause\n\n\n very tiring\n you know what\n\nyou can do and you know how,\n Even though it's a different group\n Every year it's a different group right\n No that's not true\n Actually, in split levels you can often have the same kids,\n\nfor up to two maybe three three or four years which   \n\nactually I'm sure that's worse   I haven't had that experience myself\n\nbut I'm sure that's worse for them uhh\n Instead of changing having like the\n\n<unclear> five or six words </unclear> \n,\n Do all sorts of\n And you have also, all the two years of uh math sheets that\n\nyou've  accumulated so that you don't have to do

the video\n\n uh\n Some of you were in the hallway talking with me so you know what\n\nI'm talking about\n I brought a video that was made, some of it was made my first\n\nyear in the north\n I didn't

\n\n<$ZG> \n\n<$A>  English uh it\'s\n\nEnglish\n\n\n<$ZG> \n\n<$A> \n Yeah I\'ll talk about that in a little while,\n\n<$ZG> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  two\n\n  two    types of  tests that you have  , ah     to   take  , okay\n The first, is usually some sort of grammar test\n Grammar correction often what they do is give you uh, a sample\n\nessay from a student, and they ask you to correct it, okay\n As you correct it they don\'t give you any guidelines you just\n\ncorrect it,\n Or ah another cegep I went to I got a multiple choice, fill in\n\nthe blanks, the <unclear> three words </unclear> type of thing,\n It\'s sounds funny some of them are complicated,\n The last one I got was uhm, uhm,\n\n\n  I   was very upset at this time because I\n\ndidn\'t get a lot of time to write this test in which is <unclear> one or two\n\nwords </unclear>, so I did the grammar test very very badly\n And it was, pretty hard grammar test, and I didn\'t know the\n\nrules, on a lot of the, uh\n\n\nyou   if you\'re really strong in grammar   then, you\n\nshouldn\'t have a problem but I\'m not,\n My strength is not grammar,\n And I missed a lot of them, okay\n\n\n typical,    French Canadian \n\n, some of these mistakes are mistakes that uhm, uhm, uh native\n\nspeakers make\n Uh I\'ll give you an example " neither, he nor I\n\n", okay " neither he nor I " and then they have\n\nthe verb " to be ",  it  should be " is\n\n" or " are ", or " am " sorry\n\n<,,>\n the type of mistake which is,\n I was not familiar with the rule and had to go and look it up and I\n\ncan see some of you going, " I, I are, neither him nor I are\n\n"  or whatever \n Anyways, the whole point is I had to go and look it up\n\nafterwards but, uhm,\n So you do have to do some sort of grammar test\n I wish I\'d brought\n I probably have it somewhere if I have it I\'d show it to you,\n\nbut if, I don\'t well, I can\'t    \n\n<$A> ,\n there is\n\n  a grammar test\n The second thing you have to do is write some sort of essay,\n\nokay\n The essay is uh usually something like, what does it mean to be\n\na cegep teacher or, why do you want to teach in cegep \n\n<$A> , often they ask you this in\n\nFrench or in English, so you might have to write a French composition also\n\n<,> okay  \n\n<$ZG> \n\n<$A>  two or three words\n\n</unclear>\n It\'s even worse\n I\'ll talk about other things later\n\n<$ZG> \n\n<$A>  Doesn\'t matter\n\n<$ZG> \n\n<$A>  Okay, ah so you have to do grammar okay so yeah\n French ability is important\n\n\ngrammar test,\n thing and probably,\n\n something I\'m     going to   \n\nmention that, seems so obvious but, they tell me uh, the \n\ninterviewers  one of the reasons why I got the job,\n\n\n<$A>  overdress,\n I mean\n\n  I wouldn\'t wear a tuxedo  or anything like\n\nthat \n of interviews with\n\njeans \n like now I went to some of my interviews in\n\n<,>\n\n\nand   just    a nice   shirt\n\n<,,>\n Appearance is so important\n People are so influenced with appearance\n\n\n <unclear> three or four words </unclear>  they\'re looking at you\n\nstanding in front of a class, and how are these students    going to   react to you  \n\n \n\n<$A>  And that\'s really really important\n you\n\nknow, it\'s really important\n Uh I got so many jobs and, so many people told me, well,\n\nyou got the job cos you\'re clean,\n\n\nword </unclear> interviews but apparently there are  people who\n\ndon\'t you know\n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$A>  can can\n\nyou can ,   when you\'ve finished eating   \n So,\n Ah okay the other thing that\'s so important and you can\'t change\n\nthis    there\'s nothing   you can\n\ndo about it but personality,\n And that\'s how I got most of my jobs was based on my personality\n\n ,  how   I acted and stuff,\n Uhm, the interviews are hard they usually try to make them hard\n don\'t usually laugh and\n\nthey sit and stare at you and,\n Make you feel very uncomfortable\n smile\n\nand, even if they\'re ripping you apart just go <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<,>\n That\'s really hah\n\n\n<$A> , But uh,\n\n\n<$ZH> \n\n<$A>  really\n It sounds funny but, just keep smiling\n get into a conflict\n\nsituation with them where it\'s\n\n\nturn   get   you into a conflict situation sometimes,\n\n<$ZI> \n\n<$A>  To see how you react and if you react negatively you can just\n\nkiss that job goodbye\n So you really really, you know,\n\n\n some   teachers  like  or, just avoid it in very\n\ninteresting ways,\n And uh or, you know, deal with it very very professionally\n\n<,> okay\n Uhm, the other thing they might ask\n Okay, and the last thing about being hired might be uh sex is\n\nimportant\n ah\n\nyour sex    \n\n<$A>  where\n\n  I am now there\'s two teachers myself and another teacher, who ah\n\nare the last ones in, on    the   thing\n\n\n<,> she will get the job cos it\'s a woman, okay\n So men are at a slight disadvantage\n of\n\n two teachers and the first one who is already hired, and they\'re\n\n<unclear> one or two words </unclear> quota for women or men uhm, you\n\ncould lose the job,    okay   so\n It usually doesn\'t affect you\n They usually know that ahead of time\n\n\n  between you   and a woman,  I\n\nmean, providing you\'re not a woman, uhm, if it\'s a man and a woman\n\nthey often choose the woman, okay\n a slight disadvantage\n And the unfortunate thing it\'s a cegep-wide policy which, uh I\n\nusually agree with cos there\'s not many female, cegep teachers,\n\nunfortunately, in the language department   ah  there\'s  , quite a few women\n be by department but\n\nthey do it by cegep\n So it\'s a bonus for women and it\'s a, little bit of a drawback\n\nfor men,\n Anyways\n uhm I was going to mention\n\nsomething oh okay no I\'ll get to that later,\n Contracts,\n The type of contract you can get,\n sounds of writing on board with chalk\n\n part-time\n like the\n\nstuff they give you in uh, elementary school, for the kids to play with\n\n <unclear> three or four words\n\n</unclear> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Part-time and full-time\n So there\'s two kind of contracts, there\'s part-time,\n\nfull-time\n full-time is uh\n\n ,  five courses\n\n<,> okay\n And part-time obviously is anything, uh less,\n\n\nelse, later\n\n<$ZJ> \n\n<$A>  Per term,\n Yeah on,\n If you save your questions to the end\n\nI\'ll answer <unclear> word </unclear>  \n\n<$A>  five per\n\nterm \n\n<$A>  I always wanted to do that\n audience laughter\n\ncontinues \n\n<$A>  you can\n\n  get it by session, okay\n Which is what I had which is a replacement contract, but you\n\ncan get, ah a position which is not, a replacement contract\n But, so you get, it by session, okay,\n sounds of writing on\n\nboard with chalk , okay\n rather not\n\ntalk about the part-time contract\n looks bad\n\n but, there\'s  probably not that many contracts,    it\'s all   full-time  okay\n you can\n\nwork thirty years in a cegep by session, getting session contracts,\n you\'ll\n\nnever get  uh,  you\'ll never get a   sabbatical or uh,\n\nyour pay raises you\'re part of the union but    you never get   permanent status,    okay  ,\n sounds of writing\n\non board with chalk  uh <unclear> word </unclear> okay, which\n\n<unclear> one or two words </unclear> post, okay\n You need three posts\n\n  , to get permanent\n\n<,,>  \n\n<$A>  " Permanent " with an E or an A\n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A> \n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n\n<$A>  I got a really good computer this year with a spellcheck,\n\n<unclear> a few words </unclear>  \n\n<$ZD> \n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  Okay, so uh the post is by year,\n\n\nthe same cegep   to get   uh uh  permanent\n\n , okay\n If you ever get offered a post just take it,\n It\'s so hard to get, okay\n At this point in time they\'re really hard to get\n I\'m trying to get a post and it\'s really really hard, okay\n Three posts you become permanent\n The day you become permanent is the day you start dreaming about\n\nyour sabbatical, okay\n I think it takes about seven years, okay\n But, if you get this by session you never get a sabbatical,\n You can work years and years and years and years and never get a\n\nsabbatical, okay\n That\'s the biggie\n That\'s the big difference between a post and, a permanent\n\nposition\n Sorry by session\n\n\ngonna   going to   work the next session \n\n<$A>  Which is a real pain,\n I have money I\'m working it\'s\n\ngreat and then, uh come May I\'ll be like panicking cos, I won\'t have a\n\njob, okay\n go out there again\n\nand search for  it \n You get a post, it\'s quite nice there\'s a good chance you\'ll\n\nget another post, okay\n These are almost,\n are really good,\n So if you get a post there\'s a very very good chance, you would\n\n , uhm  get   another one, \n\n<$ZL> \n\n\n<$A>  do that,\n union contract\n\n<,> okay \n\n<$A>  cegeps, if\n\nthey\'re not sure,\n If they\'re sure, they\'ll give you a post,\n If they\'re not sure they\'ll give you contracts\n other student, uh\n\npopulations, okay\n\n<$ZL> &\n\n<$ZM> \n\n<$A>  What they did uhm, my last cegep one teacher was teaching\n\nfourteen years by contract, okay\n And only uh, two years ago they gave him a post, so,\n Usually I think the rule is that if they have,\n Some cegeps work like this\n the person like\n\n uhm,  they\'re always   needing two people, the first\n\nperson will get the post\n They\'ll create a position,\n\n\n sessional person, okay\n Usually that works, but not always\n It depends on the cegep\n\n Administration in cegep is the pits, okay, uh\n And, there is no third one\n Yeah no no there is no third one, okay\n So you really want to get a post, okay,\n\n\n overheads but I didn\'t have time so I\'m    going to\n\n  put this on the board,\n And this is probably, everything,\n audience responds\n\n\n\n<$A>  audience responds\n\n\n\n<$A>

course is ask everybody involved to\n\nintroduce themselves and just, say as much as they'd like to about why\n\nthey're here,\n you can volunteer any\n\n<,> uh recounting of any experience you may have had calling nine one one or\n\n<,> doing the Heimlich manoeuver or heaven forbid doing C P R\n Which in fact doesn't happen very often\n People don't do C P R very often,\n who'd like to start\n\n\n Now I think\n don't keep track anymore\n One of those things\n But since the late seventies the very late seventies\n And so I've seen trends come and go and different attitudes and\n\nwhatnot\n spite of my ability\n\nlike many support staff type employees here to bitch about the place, it\n\nis a credit to the university that they have maintained  \n\n at whatever   a reduced level this, training for employees\n always thought it was a good idea\n\nand it's in a way even better that they're doing their own C S S T \n\ntraining now ,\n, who is\n\nin the process of becoming a C P R instructor \n Did I lose my chalk\n I lost my chalk\n Na na na na na, hm hm hm\n\n Board a sort of outline\n Something to refer to, since you don't have a complete manual\n Wow look at this chalk,\n So with the Heartsaver if you, recall from December ninety-three\n\n<,> what the Heartsaver course was about, was, to help you respond to\n\nan emergency, situation using C P R, and  similar techniques,\n And this type of an emergency, is when anybody collapses\n and that's\n\n as a responder here  this is      the ideal course   for someone who is willing to be\n\nresponsive, in this setting,\n a daycare or\n\nsomething then you would probably take a course that also included paediatric\n\n<,> type emergencies So    the  \n\nskills you will have to learn will include recognizing , an emergency and being able to assess it and being\n\nable to respond, \n So these are skills, to remember as well, as the technique\n Respond\n R E S P O N D\n Respond\n Okay\n So this is something that I tend to focus on, and this, you\n\nget with the A B Cs of C P R\n Which hopefully ring a bell with you\n themsleves\n\ninclude, the Heimlich manoeuver, and C P R \n That's pretty well it for the actual techniques you have to learn\n it\n\nhas to be   you have to be   comfortable, with your ability\n\n<,> and willingness to respond to a situation\n They go hand in hand\n feel able\n\nthen you'll be less willing et cetera,\n And you might think after three years of no training or something I\n\nbetter not do anything\n best response for you always\n\nto have is to call for help\n So if you're ever willing to do that,\n If you know remotely how to call for help then that will be an\n\nexcellent response, and something that not that many people are\n\nnecessarily capable of \n This is a very simple course designed, to train people to be\n\nresponsive in, sudden death types of emergencies or sudden, anything\n\ntype of emergency involving adults,\n And there are in my mind two important parts to it, and the most\n\nimportant part is as far as I'm concerned an ability and willingness to\n\nrecognize an emergency and assess it and then respond\n And of course once you get through recognition assessment and you\n\n   want to   get into a response then there are a\n\ncouple techniques that you would do well to feel comfortable doing,\n Especially if you've done this training before, the onus is even\n\nmore on you, to assess yourself while you're here today because this is\n\nyour opportunity to become comfortable and be sure that you understand\n\nsomething that you didn't understand before or that you, improve a\n\ntechnique that you learned before\n And really it's a very short simple course\n The techniques to be learned are variations of the Heimlich\n\nmanoeuver and C P R,\n rescuer doing C P\n\nR on an adult victim\n Alright,\n the backround that's usually gone into involve\n\nanatomy and physiology, and risk factors for heart attacks and whatnot,\n\n\n right off the bat   is to   ask\n\nyou to try a rescue here,\n Just to see if you remember anything\n This\n\nisn't   an assessment at all on my part\n It's just to get you right

Tape stops\n\nand starts again \n to personnel there and ask them the majority would\n\nsay that everytime the doors of the emergency room fly open, every time\n\nthey get a call for something, they still have that panicky feeling\n my\n\nvictim and my rescuer here\n stuff that I want you to be able to\n\nthink about and try and relate to any situation including the mannequin that\n\nI <unclear> word </unclear> around here is what do you do if you find someone\n\nlying on the floor,\n She may have just collapsed in front of you or you just may find\n\nher like this\n a horrible thing,\n You've learned the assessment the A B Cs, but it's still a\n\nhorrible thing, to ever see someone obviously, not doing what you would\n\nexpect them to do\n at this\n\ncampus it's such a comfortable    campus   there\n\naren't a great many places to lie around\n When you see someone lying down there's probably something wrong\n\n<,,>\n\n\n What would be the first thing you would think,\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  Okay and would you also think of who can help me\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  I know that whenever at work even if I've seen someone cut\n\nthemselves even when I myself slice my finger with a pipette I've thought,\n\nwho can help\n How wonderful\n with these natural\n\ninclinations,\n Hell, call for help, get people to help, recognize that\n\nyou're    going to   panic in the first place and\n\nthen think, A B C,\n Thank you very much\n Would you carry on\n\n<$ZC>  Tape stops and starts\n\nagain \n\n<$A>  You would approach the victim, but first you should always\n\nwatch out for what might hurt you\n So if the room is full of smoke remove yourself from the victim\n Firefighters have to go into this and brave death\n If the victim is in the water and you can swim and feel confident\n\nto rescue the victim, lifeguards know this in greater depths as well\n But always once you determine that someone has a problem I think\n\n   it's   very normal for people to think that way\n\n<,> you think of saving yourself as well\n So you check the environment, if you can remove yourself and the\n\nvictim that's great,\n If you can't, you'll have to remove yourself,\n point in\n\nhaving two victims\n So in here this is a benign environment there's no big problem,\n\nyou can feel free to approach the victim,\n Because she looks so well, you would certainly try and wake her\n\nup\n\n\n<,>\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  mentioned the sternal rub which\n\nsome instructors are fonder of than I am which consists of grinding your\n\nknuckles into the sternum,\n So remember it's a grinding rub,\n It's using your bony knuckles against someone's bony sternum and it\n\ndoes hurt\n It isn't always required\n when a\n\nperson doesn't look  , awful and you think they might be sleeping\n When people do look awful they may literally be the colour of the\n\ncarpet, and that will be a big clue to you too\n This person looks really abnormal this person must have a serious\n\nproblem\n With the adult victim well with any victim you should yell for\n\nhelp\n With the adult victim you are supposed to go and get help\n Now this maybe something new from the time that you learned this\n\ntechnique,\n And this is based on the fact that, the adult victim will be\n\ntypically, collapsed from a heart problem, and will benefit from a\n\ndefibrillator,\n So this means when you discover that an adult person is collapsed\n\nand unconscious, then you are supposed to leave the victim or have someone\n\nelse call an ambulance\n Because you want a defibrillator there right away, okay\n All other victims, children and babies, you follow through\n\nwith the A B Cs\n So if I determine that she's unresponsive, I've hollered for\n\nhelp,  Liz  and I are rescuing her together,\n One of us can stay and carry on with the A B Cs the other one can\n\ngo and call for help,\n If she's unconscious lying here, I can rearrange her carefully\n\n<,> the way I need to to rescue her\n If I see that something is obviously broken then I would proceed\n\nwith more caution but I'd still have to intervene if she's unconscious\n After the U, for Unresponsiveness what do we have\n\n<$ZE> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$ZE> \n\n<$A>  So then you do the head tilt chin lift like this,\n\n\n do B, look listen and feel for Breathing\n And so each one just involves a little technique\n And what you should do today is try and perfect these techniques\n said if I discover that the\n\nvictim isn't breathing I will breathe for her,\n If I can get the air in then I can move through the assessment to\n\nsee and check the pulse,\n And if she has a pulse then I'll just to do mouth to mouth because\n\nI know she needs mouth to mouth and if she doesn't have a pulse then I'll go\n\nto the chest and do C P R,\n\n\ntry and rescue  Amanda  just following the A B Cs\n If everybody could come around here and watch\n,\n And then the next person will rescue that person alright\n I want to sort of shock you into doing that sort of stuff right\n\naway \n\n<$ZF>  Tape stops and starts\n\nagain \n\n<$A>  You will recognize a problem, okay, then you will\n\nassess the problem and then you will respond to the best of your ability,\n In terms of any legal considerations, the only thing you have\n\nto know is that, both the Quebec Civil Code and the Canadian Criminal Code\n\nhave articles that put the onus on any bystander to do something when there's\n\nan emergency\n This means that if your neighbour's house is on fire the law says\n\nyou're supposed to do something, which usually means call for help\n If you hear a neighbour beating up a member in the family, the\n\nlaw says both    for   the dog and for the wife or\n\nthe child or whatever the law says you should phone somebody\n\n\nloud noise, maybe a door closing \n So as long as you never try and do some emergency procedure that\n\nyou haven't been trained to do there can be no problem\n And as long as it will always be provable that you acted in good\n\nfaith\n agreement\n\nfrom audience , acting in good faith\n are the things you'll\n\nhave to consider\n That you do respond, to the extent of your ability

motivate you is that\n\n<,> in virtually eighty percent or eight times out of ten that you are in a\n\nposition to respond to an emergency you will know the victim\n So it will be in your home at your

right\n If there are two of us that would be great if I could sit here with\n\nthe arm raised putting pressure on the wound\n Ideally I would have a bandage under my hand but if not this

a broken foot do they have\n\na broken arm do they have broken ribs\n if you couldn't help but\n\nnotice   that there were broken bones you would have to do the\n\nprimary survey first\n And if you

and or suddenly   stops breathing, and or\n\nsuddenly has no more pulse, when they collapse and are, breathless and\n\npulseless, this is called sudden death\n It means that they weren't sick sicker sickest and finally expired\n\n<,> it means that they suddenly collapsed breathless and pulseless\n For a few minutes, their, status is described as being\n\nclinically dead,\n Which means that, they're not breathing and they have no pulse\n That's what clicincal death means, no breath no pulse,\n If someone intervenes either with basic life support, or\n\nadvanced life support, artificial breathing and circulation can be\n\nprovided\n And that will stabilize the situation that they're in\n And possibly this person can be reanimated, and can recover from\n\nsudden death\n If the person remains clinically dead for a period of time that is\n\nwith no breathing and no circulation, there will be organ and tissue\n\ndamage,\n When the brain is damaged enough the death will be irreversible,\n\nand this is biological death\n Brain death is biological death, and this is not reversible\n And finally if someone who has the authority to do so checks out\n\nthe victim and says I declare them legally dead this is usually a doctor,\n\nthen that is legal death\n So of course there are people who are dead who are not legally dead\n\n<,>\n There have been enough cases of people who were not dead to have\n\nbeen declared legally dead\n But the only one that involves you, is clinical death,\n And the only assessment you can make, following the A B Cs is is\n\nthis person breathing, is their heart beating\n And so that's all you have to know,\n That's all you ever have to know\n And anyone can check a pulse and anyone can check breathing\n And you can and if you do and discover that the person has no\n\npulse and no breath\n Unless its cause could hurt you too, it doesn't matter why they\n\ncollapsed, or how, and it doesn't matter how long they've been\n\ncollapsed

recognize completely my lack of artistic ability I\n\nrarely draw a heart\n writing on\n\nchalkboard ,\n draw\n\none today \n loud noise, something falling on the\n\nfloor , that the heart is about this big\n Your heart is about the size of your fist and your heart is about\n\nthe size of your fist,\n And we can generalize and say that everyone's heart is about,\n\nthe size of a fist\n Their own fist\n Nestled, right here, in the thoracic cavity the chest cavity\n\n<,>\n And what you have in your chest cavity which is limited up here by\n\nyour collar bone    okay   and down here by your\n\ndiaphragm,\n of this famous\n\ndiaphragm that helps you breathe, and gives you hiccups,\n Well all in here from here to here and from here to here, you\n\nhave lungs\n That's it\n Lungs, blood vessels, a little few spaces, and, a heart\n\n<,> nestled, between the lungs\n And there's a lot of connections between the lungs, and the\n\nheart,\n fact that the heart pumps\n\nblood through the circulatory system, which goes into the lungs to be\n\noxygenated\n So there's a big connection here\n Your lungs are like big sponges, from here to here\n One thing\n can\n\nhardly ever refrain from saying it\n That's why when prople are stabbed or shot, their lungs are\n\naffected\n even if you miss the heart it\n\ncan cause serious damage\n The lungs, they hit the lungs\n And the lungs are highly vascular, with a lot of very small\n\nblood vessels, which go through the lungs and pick up oxygen and leave\n\ncarbon dioxide behind\n And carbon monoxide for that matter,\n Or anything else,\n Any other gaseous thing, which is mostly carbon dioxide, some\n\ncarbon monoxide, and, oxygen\n And if this connection keeps functioning well then we all just go\n\nabout our business with our heart beating, and breathing away,\n\n\nand   cos   you do have some control over your breathing you\n\ncan hold your breath\n But in the end it's an involuntary thing\n You will breathe\n Unfortunately there are problems that can arise with one's heart\n\nand one's breathing which may lead to your collapse a victim's collapse,\n\nand this is when it's good to have a rescuer arrive\n It would be great in the province of Quebec if, the average\n\namount of rescuers in the population were closer to say ten percent than one\n\npercent\n But in the mean time, it might be interesting for you to know\n\nthat,    to   realize that if the room is\n\nfull of smoke for instance, that can compromise your breathing\n So if you get out of the room full of smoke, if you take the\n\nvictim out of the room full of smoke, that can be a great help\n Time is often a crucial factor so the longer you stay, in a room\n\nfull of smoke the more likely you are to collapse from it,\n I think everybody has heard that, in a fire in a house on fire\n\nin a room on fire  ,  what   is the worst thing\n\nis the smoke that makes them collapse not the fire that burns them\n People don't necessarily get burned in fires, and if they do\n\nit's long after they've collapsed because of the carbon monoxide from the\n\nfire,\n And other, toxic things in the air,\n So I think everybody can\n Maybe I'll ask each person if you can\n Can you tell me one thing off the top of your head that can go\n\nwrong with your breathing or your heart\n They're interconnected so if something affects your breathing it\n\nwill affect your heart and vice versa,\n My example is a house on fire\n You have to think of something else\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  Okay\n\n<$ZE> \n\n<$A>  Pardon me\n\n<$ZE> \n\n<$A>  An epileptic seizure, can, sometimes cause a person to\n\nstop breathing depending on the severity or the duration and also any damage\n\nthey might incur to themselves having the seizure\n So that's a possibilty\n Can you think of one\n Did you say\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  An asthma attack\n If people have asthma, it can compromise their breathing so\n\nmuch that they can't breathe\n If someone stops breathing, whether it's because of, the\n\nsecondary effects of an epileptic seizure which in itself doesn't necessarily\n\nuh cause someone to stop breathing\n\n\nif it   if the   result is too prolonged then you can't\n\nbreathe\n You have to breathe periodically in order to be able to breathe\n So once you stop breathing, for a few minutes you can't breathe\n\nagain and so then you're in respiratory arrest\n So sure asthma can be life threatening that way\n\n<$ZF> \n\n<$A>  reaction\n\n<,>    what   happens is that mucous membranes \n\n  are   most susceptible to a strong allergic\n\nreaction,\n And maybe you've heard the term anaphylactic shock\n\n<$ZF> \n\n<$A>  That type of reaction means that you have such a strong\n\nreaction, and it involves your airway so that you can't breathe,\n And people who have serious allergic reactions they often end up\n\nhaving a respiratory arrest from it\n\n<$ZG> \n\n<$A>  Choking on something is a very common problem, and is very\n\neasily    remedied   if someone sees you choking\n\nand gets up and does the Heimlich manoeuver right\n If you're choking it means that your airway, which consists of\n\nyour mouth your nose, your throat, and then these tubes that someone\n\nmay or may not have described to you at some point that go down into your\n\nlungs,\n Your windpipe is here, goes down into your lungs branches into\n\n<,> bronchi which branch into bronchioles which branch into, alveoli right\n The whole idea is, that this whole lung area will have as much\n\nsurface area inside as possible, to take the oxygen   \n\nout of   the air that you need\n it's because\n\nsomething is, stopping you from breathing into your mouth or your nose \n\n  or if there is   a blockage in your\n\nthroat,\n Or even if you have something in your lungs that's keeping the\n\noxygen from going from the air into your blood\n Anything that keeps the oxygen out of your blood, will make it\n\nimpossible for you to breathe\n So choking is a common cause\n And other things of course are being struck by lightning,\n\ntrauma, uh drug reactions, heart attacks, strokes\n So there are lots of things that can end up affecting either your\n\nrespiratory or your circulatory system  \n\n\n\n<$A>  Right\n start first with\n\nsomething that's not  tough  which is, how to test your camera\n Right,\n do\n\n<,> is, just  pretest  this, the century chart which is for the\n\nfocus of the lens, and see how sharp the lens is, and how much leeway\n\nyou have in its focus,\n In the uhm, being over and under, soft focus\n And this which is, a really bad chart, for an example at the\n\nuniversity but it's a chart for in French  <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n in English registration costs\n is kind of an example, of

if it\'s off if it\'s completely correct, it\'ll be\n\non the film\n The next thing you do is you take that off\n You readjust your focus so that it\'s out of focus,\n At the same position that you were in without moving anything you\n\nredo the focus by eye, and you write on the chart or on the piece of tape\n\n" by eye ",\n That way, you can then see on the film the difference between your\n\neye and the measurement\n If both of them are exactly the same, the lens is calibrated\n\ncorrectly, and you\'re not forced to take measurements, on set when\n\nyou\'re running out of time\n If you know the lens is right you can just do it by eye,\n But\n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$A>  But if your eye\'s not calibrated, then you have to do the\n\nmeasurement\n If the measurement\'s not calibrated you have to do it by eye\n Hopefully both are,\n Because that way when you have to do any kind of focus pulling,\n\nin a dolly shot or in a crane shot, you know that you can count on your\n\nmeasurements\n Otherwise you have to take marks by eye and in no lighting\n\nsituations, it\'s harder to tell your focus at F two than it is at F\n\nsixteen\n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$A>  So, if you know that the calibration\'s correct for both\n\nthen that leaves it up to you as the camera assistant or the operator to make\n\nthat decision\n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$A>  But if you know it\'s not\n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$A>  Then, you know, you\'re trapped in the situation of\n\neither by eye or by measurement \n Preferably by eye, because, you can trust your eye\n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$A>  Yeah\n So then, after you got those two measurements by eye and then\n\n<,> by the measuring tape the next step is to, test the latitude of your\n\nfocus\n\n\nwrite   next to it a plus\n And go slightly, over the focus so you\'re at eight and a half\n\nfeet and film it, for about five feet worth of film\n Then stop, put another plus sign\n Film it again, for another five feet,\n This time maybe at nine feet\n Knowing that, depth of focus is one third two thirds behind\n\nyou\'re probably    going to   have less focus in\n\nfront, of the subject\n But, let\'s say that it is in focus, then you know you\'ve got\n\na lot of latitude on the  slant  and it\'s better in real life\n\nsituations\n Then you do it with minus, which is the exact opposite and you\n\ngo to seven and a half feet and then again to seven feet, with minus minus\n Once that\'s done, you\'ve tested the lens and you can put it away\n But, you have to do that for each lens\n The only part where this becomes more work is when you\'re working\n\nwith the zoom lens, cos you have to test it at different points on the\n\nzoom\n going to\n\n  have to move the camera in,\n Do all your measurements at wide\n\n\nthe twenty-five thirty-five or fifty millimetres which are common lenses to\n\nbe used\n And then, move it back out further\n Go telephoto and do it at either one hundred or ninety somewhere in\n\nthere\n So that you know that the entire range of the lens, and how the\n\nopticals are working so that you feel comfortable on set\n Once that test is done you\'re finished with your lenses\n\n\nword </unclear> \n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  Well what happens with the zoom lens\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A> \n\n the zoom\n gonna\n\n  going to   have to change your distance for each lens\n Because what happens is if I\'m standing here and I have a wide,\n\nten millimetre lens I\'m    going to   see the\n\nwhole chart\n be able to\n\ntest my focus in here\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  So then, I would bring it into the closest point of focal\n\ndistance that I have\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  Which may be two feet so maybe five feet\n\n<$ZB> \n And try to get my focus there\n And do it so that I have more smaller lines, in it so that I can\n\nsee the clearness of the definition\n Because that\'s what tests, you definition how sharp the lens is\n The lens can be in focus but it could be very, dull focus right\n And you would prefer to have a sharp focus and a clear image\n So the idea being that you would bring it closer depending on what\n\nthe lens is\n But when you\'re working with a zoom lens, what happens is when\n\nI\'m at twenty-five I could be here\n, so I have\n\nto move it in\n But when I go telephoto, I can\'t get focus, because it\'s just\n\ntoo close so I have to move back\n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A>  Well, to have as much of, a variety of lines, and\n\ndifferent images in it, like small and large\n or Michel\n\nTrudel , there they have a tripod that\'s\n\nbolted into the ground with a camera\n\n<$ZC> \n And it\'s just a flowing chart, on a pulley sytem,\n And it\'s got a box in it that lights itself, and then you just\n\nmove the chart with the little rope, at the distance you need\n Wait for it to stop moving, do your test, and then send it\n\nout or bring it in\n do\n\ntests generally at the university you\'re    going to \n\n do them at, the rental houses\n And they have everything there for you\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  The prime\n It depends, if I have a fifty millimetre prime, I can be,\n\nfurther away, and get the, image like that\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  Well it depends\n lens\n\nI have to move closer to fill the screen, with the image\n lens\n\nit\'s roughly the same I don\'t have to move\n going to\n\n  get is this\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  Well, one distance per lens\n Depending on the lens right\n Some lenses can be\n Like twelve and ten are the same\n Twenty-five twenty-six thirty-five they\'re the same\n Fifty, is on it\'s own\n have\n\nto move back even further\n One twenty even further\n have\n\nto be, about, across the room\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A> \n\nwanna   want to   take one corner\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  Or, in the centre\n Cos it just repeats itself\n five\n\npoint nine \n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A> \n\ngoing to   see anything anyhow,\n Even just clean, then that\'s all, right\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  And so that\'s the uh lens\n,\n\n<$ZE> \n\n<$A>  That\'s the problem\n You can only get, so close, right\n I mean you can only get three feet\n\n\nhave a whole chart\n So you get as close as you can,\n\n<$ZF> \n\n<$A>  Yeah yeah\n\n<$ZF> \n\n<$A>  Sure\n noises of trolley being\n\nmoved start \n Like there\'s only a limited focus you have on that lens\n\n<$ZG> \n\n<$A>  Ah, depends\n See what happens with a five point nine or a fisheyed lens is you\n\nneed to have more light to have better focus,\n Cos there is one focus point on it,\n But that like the focus point could be two feet it could be five\n\nfeet it could be one foot\n\n\nabout 12 seconds, due to trolley noises  </unclear>\n But the more light you have the better focus you have,\n gonna\n\n  going to   be from the subject of focus \n So we\'ll do it with\n If you can get three or four one K lights, right on the chart\n\n<,> you could bring your lens really close, and do it\n But generally the fisheye, the best way to test it is just to\n\nlook through it\n Run around the room with it, you\'ll be fine\n But because I mean if it\'s in focus when you\'re, got it and you\n\ncan see it it\'s the best you\'re    going to   get\n\ncos\n\n<$ZH> \n\n<$A>  See that\'s the difference between the university and,\n\noutside\n In the university, three other crews will use your lens, and\n\nmaybe four other crews will use your camera\n\n<$ZG> \n\n<$A>  Because, if you do the test, outside of university,\n\nright, where it really counts,\n And you\'re paying two thousand a day for the camera gear\n And a hundred and fifty dollars a day for a lens, to two\n\nhundred dollars a day for a lens\n The right stuff\n But if you\'re the camera technician it\'s not even your money right\n It\'s someone else\'s money,\n Right\n\n<$ZH> \n\n<$A>  Why are you doing the tests here\n Because if everybody does the test together, and you get a\n\nreport on the equipment and you know what is good with the equipment and\n\nwhat\'s bad with the equipment\n Then when you get the camera equipment, you can then make\n\nreference to the original test and test you do that day, and see what\'s on\n\nwhat\'s off\n And then say well I decide not to use this\n right\n But if you go blind, because it\'s your own money coming out of\n\nthis, you have a greater chance of losing\n Like a friend of mine didn\'t do a camera test when I was here\n,\n He didn\'t have the gate adjusted and new black and white film\n\nstock came out\n It shaved off the first layer of emulsion, throughout the\n\nentire gate,\n Five thousand dollars worth of film,\n He spent two weeks shooting\n It destroyed an entire film and the university said well he didn\'t\n\ntest the equipment, sorry\n So, basically it\'s for insurance\n What happens is, on a production outside of the university you\n\ndo the test you look at it\n If everything\'s okay you give it to the production staff they give\n\nit to the insurance company right away\n Then the insurance can then say to the lab hey something went\n\nwrong here but our cameras are okay\n So the lab made a mistake you owe us\n And one production day is something like forty thousand dollars a\n\nday in value\n With all the staff all the equipment, set design transportation\n\ngas actors <unclear> word </unclear>\n So that\'s why you do the test\n\n<$ZI> \n\n<$A>  Well this is the best way to do it\n Watch their rushes\n The last shoot that went out, watch their rushes\n Look at their camera reports\n If things are out of focus, possibly, or one mag keeps\n\nscratching, and making uhm just any kind of bizarre marks on the film that\n\nisn\'t  inherently  good\n You know ask them\n They should have made reports, labelled the mags know which\n\none\'s doing it, right\n And then you can benefit off their mistakes and have the camera\n\ntest predone for you\n But then again, a camera test is usually done twenty-four\n\nforty-eight hours before shooting\n\n<$ZJ> \n\n<$A>  It\'s done in colour\n You don\'t print the film\n\n<$ZJ> \n\n<$A>  No you just watch the negative\n And it\'s free\n\n<$ZJ> \n\n<$A>  Yeah you just go over to the lab and say I\'d like my camera\n\n<,> test printed\n In about two hours they\'ll print it you go back and you watch it\n\non their projector\n And you say thank you you take it and you leave\n So I mean it\'s an hour and a half\'s work, in the industry it\n\npays a hundred and fifty dollars and for you it could save a film', 'subdomain':

that the pressure\n\n plates \n Make sure that its flap,\n This in my opinion is a really bad example, of a registration,\n\nchart,    okay  \n, which\n\nis one line across, one line down, with a screw, right here next to\n\nthe centre cross\n kay\n\n  okay  \n Now the idea behind this, is, you do this test first before\n\ndoing any of the other tests\n\n\nand it doesn't matter what lens you use    okay  \n\n<,>  so that it frames  , this entire chart  \n\n okay  \n\n\nokay  \n And you have to remember that you have to superimpose an image\n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$A>  No but for a hundred and fifty dollars in an hour and a half's\n\nwork, you can go into a black bag and do it in two minutes,\n Really fast\n Some cameras go in reverse\n The cameras that do go in reverse there's a little trick\n\n What you do is, you try to get this lid for F four then film it\n\nat two point eight,\n The trick is not to put the cross in your viewfinder on this point\n\nit's to put it on the dot  ,  right next \n\n to it\n So you're lining up centre frame here, okay,\n And you film for fifty feet\n Then, you go into the black bag and rewind, fifty feet of\n\nfilm back\n You turn the chart over, and you reframe on where the dot is\n\nmoved to\n\n\n\n And, shoot another fifty feet and what you get is a\n\nsuperimposition, of two sets of lines like this\n And this is why I like this better cos there's too many lines\n So we'll look at this one\n So what you end up with is a superimposition with the Xs\n\noverlapping at two sets of lines, running parallel to each other\n What happens then is you watch it\n If the lines move in and out of focus, or if one line's moving\n\nin and out of focus and the other one isn't, or if the lines are moving\n\nside by side,\n Any kind of pulsation in these lines, there's something wrong\n\nwith the pressure part, cos the film isn't sitting flat against the gate\n And at that point you go to whatever lab technician if it's the\n\nuniversity or if it's, Panavision or Moliflex, or Michel Trudel and you\n\nsay this camera's no good, I'd like to change\n now the only problem is,\n\nthis test is fine for these cameras like this, but the newer cameras,\n\nare like the Aton the Arri S R one two and three, the Eclair, or the\n\nArri thirty-five B L which does not look anything like that\n magazines as\n\nthe S R or the Aton and the Eclair, which is side by side\n There the pressure plate is in the magazine, which means you\n\nhave to test each magazine,\n And you have to do this test for each magazine\n But the easier part is, there you just open up the magazine in a\n\ndark room and rewind the film, and then close it again\n Here you have to open it up, you have to unload it,\n There's a lot more work on these ones\n But you only have to do it once,\n There you have to do it three four five times\n\n\nokay  \n It's a simple test generally done first because you have to rewind\n If you have a camera, like the Arri, S which is the small one\n\nthere which can run in reverse if you have the right motor which I don't have\n\nthe right motor with us right now\n your counter\n\n  at zero you open up the front of the lens take the lens off and you\n\nhave the gate\n In the gate you make an X, on the film in the coloured pen\n Run fifty feet\n At the next,\n\n\nthe lens off   again\n You make another X\n do is put the\n\nlens on, rewind\n get to\n\nfifty feet,  you then look for your\n\nX by moving it frame by frame\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  In sixteen millimetre\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  If you're going in reverse\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  You're going in reverse\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  With the lens cap on the lens\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  counter counts back\n\ndown to about, one foot from fifty\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  Then roll, and all you're doing is rolling your twenty-four\n\nframes which is one foot\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  Till you find your X\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A> , what it is is, in\n\nthe gateway, the film will look like this,\n In the gate, that's one frame\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  Right\n You take a pen and you draw an X\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  so what you'll have is an\n\nimage like this, at two points on your film\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  Why\n Because if you've got rewind on your camera, you don't have to\n\ngo into the dark room\n You just have to find where fifty feet was\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  So you rewind by watching the counter go back fifty feet\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  And stop and look for that X and you just get that X again the\n\nstarting X\n You put the camera in forward\n You turn your chart around\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  And then you just run, to fifty feet\n And that way you're not wasting film, right\n\n\nend  of about, I    don't know   eighty\n\nninety feet\n\n\n  going to   give you four hundred feet of film\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  Cos it just costs too much money\n They'll just give you old film stock\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  Is that clear\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  No it's not a problem but it's the fastest way to do it to\n\nmake sure you're at the right place \n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A>  That you can get old film stock for your camera tests\n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A>  From the last shoot you just did\n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A>  No the lab won't give it to you but I have cans of old film\n\nstock in my trunk from productions I've done before,   \n\nokay  ,\n When I go out to a new production I say okay well it's included in\n\nmy price\n And I increase my price, for the camera test to include my film\n\nstock    okay  \n They like it because they don't have to find a short end they have\n\nall this brand new film for a feature\n\n\n do it and in that case twenty dollars whatever\n camera assistant gets all the short ends,\n them\n\n  up if you need to use    them   use \n\n  them  \n But generally everything under fifty feet is thrown out,\n If it's in thirty-five then everything under twenty-five gets\n\nthrown out  of sixteen , if it's just there and they're changing \n\nknives \n Or they'll just run out, eh\n They'll just run it out of the camera\n Or throw it out or use it for scratch tests, eh\n It's scrap,\n\n\nkay   okay  \n These lines have been put on by someone else\n What you do, is again you set up your camera, with a lens\n\n<,>\n And you just frame for a chart this size\n And there's no lines on it\n\n And once you have a frame what you do is depending on the aspect\n\nratio you're shooting in whether it's sixteen super sixteen thirty-five\n\nthere's a piece of glass in the viewpiece, that sets up the T V frame and\n\nthe frame you're filming in the film, and that X that you use for the,\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> test    okay  \n\n\nmake sure that what you're looking through is the same thing that the gate\n\nand the lens are seeing\n So this basically forms a game of like running back and forth\n But you set up the camera you frame, and you look, and you\n\nfind all the lines that mark the T V frame, the sixteen frame and the X\n\n<,>\n\n\n put   it across and you have to go back and make sure that you're\n\nright on the line\n And once you're on the line, then you do the bottom, and you\n\nkeep going back and forth \n Size\n you do the little X,\n And once that's done again you write the name of the production\n\ncompany you're working for all the information the name of the film, and\n\nyou film it\n Now, you have to write the lens that you're using, and the\n\ndistance from the lens you're at, as well as the camera,\n Once you film that what happens is this,\n If you see the entire frame on film when you get the camera test\n\nback, everything's good,\n If you see half the frame, you've got a big problem\n If it cuts off any part of the frame it's not, calibrated\n\ncorrectly,\n\n\nfigs   figures   like, figure out what the shift to right\n\nand left or up and down is, and then compensate on set, or you go to\n\nthem and say, fix it\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  here yeah they'll do it\n\nand if you're paying thousands of dollars a day, they will do it , right\n So, that's, the test\n Now by knowing this you can get work, doing camera tests for\n\npeople,\n And make, decent money very fast\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  they don't teach you\n\nthat here other than me so that's why you know it,   \n\nokay  \n So once you've done your camera tests, we'll move on to the\n\ncameras, which is the Arri S and the B L sixteen   \n\nmillimetre  \n Now, these two cameras the B Ls are not used anymore,\n But the Arri S is used frequently\n\n\nsigh  inconvenient, for anything from loading to, making scratch\n\ntests, when    checking   your film,\n\nwhen you're starting your magazine\n The Arri S is used, as a second unit camera, because one\n\nit's indestructible, two, it's got a variable speed motor and a\n\ntwenty-four frame, motor\n Not quartz but it locks at twenty-four frames\n two words\n\n</unclear> like rock videos, with this camera and it's been dead on\n\n\n very noisy camera it has absolutely no insulation, but it's the exact\n\nsame mechanism\n\n<$ZE> \n\n<$A>  With this motor it runs at twenty-four frames\n You can't use\n Your sound person will have a very hard time trying to get any\n\nsound, if this is in the room\n\n<$ZE> \n\n<$A>  Yeah no problem\n\n<$ZE> \n\n<$A>  Not a problem\n You can do your entire film post like Italian style with this\n\ncamera\n\n<$ZE> \n I've done rock videos where we've had a C D which is exact time\n\n<,> in playback, with this camera, and once it's synched up, it\n\nmatches word for word the set\n Occasionally we'll lose a frame here and there\n Almost all cameras do,\n But, when you're shooting, three to one four to one ratio\n\n<,> at least, you're    going to   have\n\ncoverage that is    going to   be in synch at all\n\ntimes, right\n So it's not a problem\n\n<$ZF> \n\n<$A>  Which lights\n All of them\n\n<$ZF> \n\n<$A>  The closest ones\n\n That's why this is a good camera to know, right\n And as well, this camera only works with bayonet-mount style\n\nlenses, while this one works with, both, bayonet and C-mount,\n\nwhich means that you have more flexibility\n And what makes it a great camera is that you can be on set you can\n\ncome with a

gotta\n\n  have got to   fight, to keep it quiet\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  It's hard to say like I mean there are preferences right\n I mean what I've worked with more is Arri cameras\n So I like Arri cameras better\n I like the loading system and the mechanisms\n, the Eclair is\n\nbetter for handheld than this camera, without a doubt\n camera is, heavy and\n\nit's awkward compared to the Eclair\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  This one yeah\n\n\nmagazine  , and it can also run on daylight spools\n So I mean, it's completely flexible\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  On this\n barney\n\n,    okay   which is a jacket for it\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  laughter from\n\naudience \n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  Nothing\n What really works well for this camera, is a down blanket and a\n\nleather jacket, and two sound blankets  ,  over the camera\n\noperator and the <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<$ZB> \n\n\n keep everything together\n Then underneath, the camera once you've got the camera covered\n\nwhat happens is the sound goes down\n And in Montreal we have concrete floors, and we have hardwood\n\nfloors\n\n\nreverb   reverberations  \n Which means that the boom operators point the boom down, as\n\nthey're taught in this university, to record the sound,\n get the\n\nvoice, of the actor but they're    going to  \n\nget the sound of the camera bouncing off the floor and echoing back into the\n\nmic\n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A>  What you do is, in the crotch of the tripod, right\n\nunderneath the uh screw where you level it, put another sound bracket,\n\n   okay  \n So really what you need is, depending on how of an enclosed\n\nspace right\n If you're outside and you're on a telephoto lens, you don't need\n\nanything\n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A>  But if you're at this distance, and there you're the\n\nsoundman at a distance of three and a half feet \n\nfrom my gate, he's    going to   have a heart\n\nattack trying to get any    kind of   sound\n be\n\nthrowing a lot of sound blankets, on it\n remember to put\n\none underneath, to prevent the sound from bouncing down,    okay  \n And like that it's fine\n Like that it works well\n When I shot with this there was no camera noise but we, spent a\n\nlot of time, in the first four hours of the shoot, trying to figure out\n\nhow to stop the sound   \n\n okay  ,\n, now I'll show you the\n\ninsides of these cameras\n loud scraping noise\n\n, to load than the Arri S\n But the magazine is the opposite\n So I mean they're both similar,\n,\n\n\n is   where the eyepiece is\n This silver, knob is turned like that and the door opens,\n\n So you've opened it,\n\n\n okay  ,\n,\n Here, is your pressure plate, and your door,\n And, the pin, registration pin, sits right there, on\n\nthis little hook\n loud noise, something sliding\n\nacross the floor \n\n\n<,>\n You push that down, and turn and if you watch, not only does\n\nit move the film through the gate frame by frame but it, adjusts the\n\nregistration pin\n In order to load the camera, you need to have that pin up,\n Which is just you know, you'd see that whether or not I told you\n There's no way to get the film in the gate\n\n\n<,> looks like so,    okay  ,\n, it's\n\n   got to   be off the camera\n To take it off\n This is the only problem I have with this camera is this one design\n\nproblem\n The handle is in the way of the mag\n that if you are\n\nworking on a tripod, and you're inside and you're not doing handheld,\n\ntake it off\n To take this off you pull, forward\n It pulls this up, unlocks the handle and slides out\n mag\n\n  magazine  , which is just turn this knob, and it pulls\n\n<,> a metal sheet out that locks it, the    magazine\n\n  and there you go\n\n\n, is,\n The easiest way to describe it for people to remember and it's the\n\nsame as that    magazine   for the Arri S, is\n\nyou do a nine, in and then a mirror image of a nine out\n That's what the film looks like\n see what I mean but\n\nthat's how you remember it,\n loud\n\nnoise starts   underneath are   the white\n\n<,> sprockets,\n pulls\n\n  the film through\n Keep it going\n Right here which, there's another little notch, that notch\n\ntells you,\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A> \n That's your loop the length of the loop\n You then return the film, into the mirror hole on the other side\n\nand you move the other, wheel, <unclear> word </unclear>,\n And you have to be precise\n Otherwise you'll get more noise, and the film could break as\n\nwell,\n And, you might be saying why am I doing it upside down\n\n\n see what you're doing anyhow,\n And this is what I mean by a mirror image of the nine,\n And never forget to put, these arms down, because that's\n\nyour footage counter\n your camera operator and director of\n\nphotography will send you back into the black bag, to put them down cos\n\nthat's the only way to tell what the footage is\n three words\n\n</unclear> camera footage  counter on\n\nthe camera the footage counter here runs the one on the camera,    okay  \n kay\n\n  okay  \n You put the back in first, push this down, and tighten the\n\nscrew,\n And don't hold it like that,\n The next step is to push this in,\n Really there's nothing to show\n There's a loop inside the camera,\n my loop's too big,\n\n<$ZE> \n\n<$A>  Because, it must have slipped when I was trying to get it\n\nin and pushed out more film\n So that means I have to go back into the black bag,\n\n<$ZF> \n\n<$A> ,\n background noises and audience talking for about 20\n\nseconds \n\n\n use a different mount\n\n<$ZG> \n\n<$A>  magazines\n\n ,\n\n<$ZH> \n\n<$A>  Each mag can take four hundred\n\n<$ZG> \n\n<$A>  It's twelve and a half to thirteen minutes because they\n\nalways put a little bit of  work room on it  \n\n<$ZH> \n\n<$A>  What\n\n<$ZH> \n\n<$A>  Yeah was it the Arri three,\n Cos the Arri three is one of the last, that are being used\n\n<$ZI> \n\n<$A>  that have magazines\n\n\n<$ZI> \n\n<$ZI> \n\n<$ZJ> \n\n<$A>  pause about ten seconds\n\n\n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A>  Yeah it's just that if you're not working in a tent, which\n\nis\n I don't know if you've seen those bags\n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A>  Yeah it's just that if you have a, university black bag\n\n<,> you have a greater chance of ripping the bag\n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$ZL> \n\n<$A>  Nah it depends on the film stock\n\n<$ZL> \n\n<$ZM> \n\n<$A>  Don't have the gate for it\n It's a different gate\n\n\n\nbackground noises and audience talking for about 55 seconds \n\n\n  with the   door shut,   \n\nokay  ,\n, are jammed uhm\n\nbut I'll take a look at them and  Bob  and me'll make sure that\n\nthey're fixed for the time that you    got to  \n\nstart shooting,    okay  \n\n<$ZN> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$ZN> \n\n<$A>  The Arri S\n\n<$ZN> \n\n<$A>  to\n\nthe B L\n\n<$ZN> \n\n<$A> \n\n magazine  ,    okay  , has this\n\nmotor attached to the <unclear> word </unclear>\n this is the motor that runs\n\nthe film through it\n The difference between the Arri S which again makes it a more\n\nflexible camera is that I need three    magazines \n\n, I go get three    magazines  \n because my\n\nmotor comes off\n And so\n\n<$ZO> \n\n<$A>  The Arri S\n The thing is it's actually easier to load because it's a flat\n\nsurface,    okay  \n\n\n completely uninterchangeable, with the B L,\n\n\nand say well one'll go on the Arri the S and one'll go on the B L,    okay  \n So, with the film in, this is what the camera should sound\n\nlike,\n And one thing you have to do is get, to know what a, proper\n\nsounding camera is and what a camera that's not running well sounds like,\n So, to start your camera on the pistol grip here is your on and\n\noff button,    okay   \n That is what a proper sounding camera is, supposed to sound\n\nlike \n\n<$ZP> \n\n<$A>  camera starts running\n\n\n\n<$ZP> \n\n<$A>  laughter\n\nfrom audience \n\n\n<$ZQ> \n\n<$A>  Yeah\n I'm just slightly distracted cos the production I'm working on\n\njust called me with a nine one one message, so\n\n<$ZR> \n\n<$A>  Well let me just fix this to show you that the camera is not\n\na complete disaster  \n There\n that's\n\n\n<$ZS> \n\n<$A>  Why\n\n<$ZS> \n\n<$A>  A power surge\n\n<$ZT> \n\n<$A>  Yeah the sound\n The sound of the camera\n But I wasn't listening to it cos I was being paged\n But, uhm the sound of the camera cos, it doesn't have a\n\nfluid motion anymore\n You hear it in the magazine something happened\n For example this is\n I'm gonna show you an example\n\nof a jam, would be to have the film go in without a pick-up, right\n You heard what it sounded like clean but this is what it sounds\n\nlike ,\n becomes louder, there's a\n\nscraping sound and as the film gets, full \n But don't forget your ear's next to the camera at all times,\n\nright,\n\n That\n\n<$ZU> \n\n<$A>  Yeah,\n Alright where you can hear, that sound,\n\n\n<$ZV> \n\n<$A>  But at the same time if you catch it soon enough, the film\n\nisn't like this like an accordion, right\n\n<$ZW> \n\n<$A>  So it's all fine,\n If you think there's a jam you go into the black bag you open it\n\n<,>\n\n<$ZW> \n\n<$A>  It's on this side, alright\n I cut it so it's not on this side but, it's on this side\n So all you have to do is wind it, cut the film off\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  Okay so I'll show you a couple of ways around that without\n\nhaving to use, the extra source\n Cos like I'm saying the extra source isn't ideal especially if\n\nyou're concerned about sound,\n Uhm, we'll get to that in a moment,\n\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> one in this case are <unclear> one or two words\n\n</unclear> bars , the synch signal\n Uhh two and three are what

{'text': "<$A>  So over here in setup you have your D V three background okay\n So, you could uhh\n You'll have to put more in that one,\n\n<$ZA> \n Uhm anyways usually you'll use the black\n And I'll show you\n fade to black,\n\nfade out from black\n Technically you could fade to yellow, and out from yellow,\n Uhm, here, we'll come back to the setup, later, uhm\n Okay this is the main thing\n Your main screen is your first scene\n That's your first scene to be edited\n The preview represents the beginning of the second scene\n In between the first and the second you want a transition\n Okay\n is my\n\neffects bag A\n I've also got effects bag C D E F G,\n there's about well there's\n\nalmost two hundred effects here \n Uh which is why it can take a while just to figure out what it is\n\nyou're doing\n Some of them are really graphic\n over\n\nhere\n baaing ends\n\n\n which is a bit well, graphic\n\nI mean\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  Some of them do but in any case the sound isn't being\n\ntransferred\n set up for it so you\n\njust hear it and, uhm\n so this is what you spend a lot\n\nof time playing\n try out some of\n\nthese effects uhh, \n That kind of thing\n And then you've also got your more,\n\n\nshow you a real cheesy one here, \n\n And Mister Clean,\n They become part of the content of your video okay so\n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A>  Beware\n Well it's sort of I mean some of this is pretty tacky really,\n\nand uh it's really how you use it\n There are some more subtle ones here\n You've got your wipes uh\n Your soft wipes and your uhm, your\n Hold on\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  Split screen\n Now it doesn't digitize it,\n It doesn't shrink it\n Although one of them will\n I'll show you that in a second\n This is good to know about though cos you can shoot for this easily\n\nenough,\n Heavy to the left heavy to the right and then combine the two,\n\nuhm\n So what I'm doing here is I highlight once and I can either\n Well I can come down here and choose a speed slow medium fast\n And then I can trigger the effect by clicking on the effect once\n\nagain\n Or I can click on auto,\n Or I can use the T bar\n Left mouse button and just drag it and just control it and leave it\n\nright there,\n And when an effect is in motion the screen usually distorts in some\n\nway or another\n I could also hit the space bar\n hit the space bar\n quite a\n\nfew   different ways depending on who you're working with and, how\n\nyou're working\n Uhm, now there are a couple which actually digitize,\n Ah let me just find one\n Okay this one for example\n Okay see what it's done\n It takes the incoming image, uhm, as a whole\n it doesn't cut it up or\n\nanything\n So now I can just like move it around and tuck it anywhere and they\n\ncan both be  removed  \n Okay,\n thing\n Uh there's also a couple that actually, superimpose themselves\n\nover your image\n\n\naccumulations ,\n Uhm and then there's also this kind of deep space thing or\n\nsomething ,\n And then there is, something called the old movie\n Cos you got rid of your dust and your scratches\n In the chrome effects you can combine this with black and white\n so you just take the colour\n\nright    out of   your video\n\n<$ZE> \n\n<$A>  Yeah I'll show you that in a second\n\n Uhm, anyways this is the sort of thing you come in and play with\n Dissolve's at the end of every effects bank\n So, again using the T bar I can just leave it as kind of a\n\ntransparent superimpose,\n Okay\n And I can record that as long as I want to,\n Or I could just take it right out\n Okay\n\n<$ZF> \n\n<$A>  There's also something called the superimpose here, which\n\nis uhm well anyway I'll\n Let me just show you\n They call it a superimpose\n It's more of a luminance keyer which means it'll key, a white or\n\na black signal out\n Okay and I'll show you, uhm\n\n<$ZG> \n\n<$A>  Yeah, yeah, uh well I'll just show you\n\n<$ZH> \n\n<$A>  No you can't set it up quite that way\n If I click on dissolve I'll go back here to setup there is the\n\neffect speeds\n The default is slow medium fast\n I can also go to variable though,\n Which means that back here in my dissolve I've got a number grid\n a\n\npretty slow dissolve here\n You'd have to experiment with it to get it to that timing\n\n<$ZH> \n\n<$A>  You can do\n Yeah you have to do it manually\n Yeah,\n But you can do it on the cut\n You would just do it manually\n\n<$ZH> \n\n<$A>  is a system in\n\nhere a G P I trigger which we did set up at one point but it was just so uh\n\nunpredictable, that, it's better to just do it yourself,\n the superimpose\n Now let's match this up with three\n\n Can you see\n\n<$ZI> \n\n<$A>  Yeah\n Uhm, I click either on black or white and then this number\n\nsystem here    it's a   numbered T bar okay\n So left mouse button and I'll just scroll,\n Okay so what happens is that, the blacks go first and are\n\nreplaced with, another video image, you see\n uh\n\nscroll bar, I can eventually take it right out if I want\n\n<$ZJ> \n\n<$A>  Yeah\n determine the\n\ngrade of that key\n pause\n\nabout ten seconds \n Alright\n\n\n\nif you   know about it uhm, then you can   \n\nkind of   shoot with that in mind a bit \n pause about\n\nten seconds \n\n Alright\n Anyway,\n Okay so again like all the stuff I'm doing there's little\n\ntutorials in the manual as you do everything\n It's pretty good, that way\n Uhm, alright so the other thing here is the freeze frame,\n Just choose something,\n The really big thing to remember about the switcher and it can be\n\na bit confusing is that, uh,    when you're\n\n  using the editor you're just    sort of \n\n concerned with the first scenario that you're editing okay\n You cut that and then you're back to finding the other one\n\n\nfind scene one and also the beginning of scene two for your other transition\n\nbetween, the two\n Okay so there's another step to it\n You've got three end points as opposed to two end points\n\n now I'll just frame grab this\n\nquickly\n It's really pretty simple to frame grab,\n let's just say here\n Uh the freeze button comes up highlit as a default\n First thing you do is take it off\n Whatever you want to grab you'll put, in the preview\n And uh click on your D Vs and press freeze, okay\n So that's now become, uhm a freeze frame and it's stored in D V\n\ntwo\n These are also called frame buffers\n They're quite temporary\n around a\n\nlittle bit chances are you'll lose it\n use it\n\nright away, you might    want to   take it to\n\nsetup and save it to the hard drive and call it back again later on okay\n save stuff to the\n\nhard drive, generally speaking just ask somebody on staff to take you\n\nthrough, how to do that\n The manual, uhm, doesn't, really show you like with our\n\nsystem of course so,\n Just let somebody know\n Uhm I'll just go to save\n Now I'll find an empty frame,\n loud\n\ncough in audience  <unclear> word </unclear> donuts and then save to the\n\nhard drive now\n So if we lose it, we can call it back\n And uhm we're going to paint, all over this frame is what we're\n\n   going to   do   \n Okay,\n\n\n on just a little bit before there was sometimes   uh\n\n<,>  on your   tape you've got two, images that you    want to   dissolve to and uh I mean you can do a\n\ncouple of things here\n You could make a copy of that tape and use it as another source\n\n<,>\n Or, you could, for example\n Alright let's just say this is scene one, here\n I'll just dissolve to black, for example\n I'll use that,\n Uhm, looks like it's fast\n\n are you with me so far,\n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A>  I mean usually this is like a four hour workshop so I'm,\n\nmoving pretty quickly,\n Alright and then whatever\n At any time you, fade to black,\n And that,\n Whenever you're in the recorder as well you're not going to see\n\n<,> the toaster\n click on all kinds of\n\nthings here    okay  \n It's all happening in the player side\n This is an output\n So once I've got something on my recorder I can't throw a dissolve\n\nonto the scene for example\n You have to do that as it's being processed through the player\n Okay\n That's something that, people sometimes find a little bit hard\n\nto get their head around\n That is an output only,\n pause about 18\n\nseconds \n fade to black, uhm,\n\nfind the next, scene\n Let's say there\n And this time I'll, fade up from black,\n So my first scene here is D V three\n going to\n\n  be edited first and I'm    going to  \n\ndissolve, to input two which is the player\n there,\n\n\n  I   triggered the effect \n Okay\n So that's one way around it\n It's a pretty common device really,\n Uhm, and it's a way of keeping your sound organized\n There's also the match frame edit uhm, which I could show you\n\n<,,>\n What you have to leave a specific time here\n\n<$ZK> \n\n<$A>  Yeah\n worth\n\nshowing you or maybe I can just explain it to you\n What I did here was find uh scene one and scene two\n In a match frame I would freeze frame the first frame of the\n\nsecond scene, set that up here,\n Maybe I should just show you\n Actually I think that'd make more sense\n\n<$ZL> \n\n<$A>  show\n\nyou \n Somebody tried to speak\n Okay\n Uhm alright so we'll never mind this for now and pretend there is\n\nnot\n Okay\n This one\n grab this one okay\n So could you\n Does somebody have a pen\n They could take note of this\n One zero zero forty, oh one,\n One zero\n\nzero forty oh one\n Forty oh one\n grab this\n\n<,,>\n Okay that's frozen\n Let's go save this to setup again\n In fact I think I'll hold on to that idea,\n going to\n\n  close the door\n\n so that's the first frame of\n\nscene two,\n\n<$ZM> \n\n<$A>  It's saving it\n\n<$ZM> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$ZM>  laughter from

camera, is the same for both\n\n<,> as well as, you know, they came out at the same time\n The were used for similar things\n One was used for sound and one was used for, just images but\n\nthey were designed and built in and around the same time, and modified,\n\ntogether\n So, really it\'s the lenses\n If you put on the newest lenses, of which you can on this\n\ncamera, you\'re going to have a very nice defined image\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  if\n\nyou\'re doing uh stock footage or special effects, or slow motion\n Cos the beauty of this camera is that, this is your motor right\n\nhere,\n Okay\n The other motor, is what controls the speed\n So the other motor, which I don\'t have with me is what creates a\n\nvariable speed camera\n You replace it, and you just turn it from right to left,\n And here is a counter,\n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A>  Ya\n\n<$ZB> ,\n Well what happens is it goes from zero to fifty all right, which\n\nmeans that you\'re going basically a stop over or a stop under\n With the film stocks that exist now with a latitude of three stops\n\nover and under, and being able to correct the overexposed film in the lab\n\n<,> you don\'t have to worry about it at all\n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A>  Like the Vision Five Hundred and the Vision Three-Twenty\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  It\'s not the best\n What it is is it\'s a very, high-speed film with very low grain\n\n<,> in comparison to the regular five hundred A S A\n So, you can shoot at night, with very low light to just\n\nambient light that exists\n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  So you put the mag on\n Then you lock it\n Like that,\n\n\n<$ZA> \n\n \n\n<$A> \n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$A>  toggle\n\nswitch  ,  locks the mag in\n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  You make the loop once you\'re inside\n,\n Okay,\n Okay,\n And then you just lock it\n And then, camera\'s secure\n So you put this on just for safety because it might get bumped,\n Cos this is the side your head\'s on,\n All right\n So it can get bumped\n So here, again you open it up,\n To control the, pin this time, is with this\n You turn it, here on the motor and it moves the pin up and\n\ndown,\n Okay,\n Frame by frame,\n All right\n So what you do,\n I\'m going to do this quickly and then I\'m going to go make a phone\n\ncall\n Is you press this button down\n This, allows you to be able to move in and out, around here\n\nwith your film\n You then,\n No\n\n<$ZC> ,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A>  So that you can see this clearly,\n Okay,\n It\'s very simple,\n Here there\'s a white line and here there\'s a white line,\n These two white lines that\'s your loop,\n That\'s the marker\n What it is you pull the film forward like that,\n Slide it in\n So this is upside\n at it\n\nupside down\n It\'s right,\n Okay\n Make the top of the loop,\n And,\n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A>  Ya,\n to see what\n\nyou\'re doing\n\n<$A>  There\n There\n You see it\n I shut my door,\n Okay,\n Then I go and I make the bottom of my loop, like so\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  short discussion among extra-corpus\n\nspeakers \n\n<$A>  And then, my film\'s loaded,\n Like that\n I just, pick this up\n Tighten it, before shooting,\n the\n\ntrick   this camera   also, jams and stalls\n Everything that can go wrong this camera will do, without a\n\ndoubt\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  No I just have to, give this a\n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A>  Fits in like that,\n\n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A> \n No no\n This is the motor that drives the camera\n This is the motor that drives the magazine\n When you\'re using a hundred foot daylight spool which is on the\n\n black \n,\n This is on these\n\n\n<$ZB> \n\n\n<$A> \n All you do is where the mag pole is you put this in\n\n<$ZZ>  agrees </O \n\n<$A>  Okay\n Only problem is every time I\'ve used one of these the cameras jam\n If you have a daylight spool, you can put it here,\n Take out the black or put it here\n Pick it up on a core\n It prevents from jamming,\n You know\n\n\n<$ZB> \n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  It can come out\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  If you lose it it\'s two hundred and fifty dollars\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  You have to make sure it goes back,\n And the lab won\'t return it\n\n\n<$ZZ> \n\n\n<$A> \n can come out, very easily,\n\nbut at that time, everything\'s <unclear> word </unclear>\n Okay\n So basically your loop\'s done\n You must tighten, these otherwise they will break because,\n\nit\'s just a surge, of power\n Cos this camera starts right away, up at speed,\n, with these,\n And it shows the arrow, of direction of which way it\'s supposed\n\nto turn,\n That\'s it\n Okay,\n And you can use a hundred foot spools and you can even use a\n\nhundred foot on  core \n Right\n You just take the black, inside part of the core and you put it\n\nthere, and it\'ll pull your core so you get your twenty feet if that\'s what\n\nyou have\n Just load it in a black bag,\n All right,\n And then, for it to run, it\'s on this battery,\n The thing about shooting with the hundred foot and the four\n\nhundred foot is because the hundred foot only uses one motor and the four\n\nhundred foot uses two motors\n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A>  No you need more power but it\'s in one battery\n And to prevent your camera from, uhm you know the film breaking\n\nrunning too slow not going at the right speed when you\'re using just the Arri\n\nS without the four hundred foot mag you must turn your battery on to eight\n\nvolts\n There\'s a switch\n This battery belt doesn\'t have the switch, so I can\'t show you\n\nthe switch\n\n\n<$ZA> \n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  roll in the camera which is\n\n      what     is\n\ncalled " camera no I D " which means there\'s no mag,\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  eight volts to prevent, damage inside\n\nthe camera cos you can brown out the battery\n There\'s too much power going in\n you film\n\nit   you put the power   on to twelve volts, or fourteen\n\nwhatever the other one is\n can\'t remember it right now\n And that\'s to run both motors, with enough power,\n This one\'s already at that, permanently and I think there\'s\n\nonly one belt here, that has the switch to go back and forth\n Okay\n So you know, this, there\'s a plus,\n One is plus and one is obviously minus one\n There isn\'t anything\n Red, on the battery belt, is always plus,\n Okay,\n audience response to camera\n\nnoise \n\n<$A>  But I mean it\'s also open\n quieter\n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A>  You can really hear your money go by\n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$A>  Fourteen volt, battery\n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$A>  No\n Okay this is what it sounds like\n\n\n<,,>\n It\'s on but it\'s off,\n Ya\n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A>  I think they\'re paid enough not to\n I don\'t know\n I\'ve never asked them this\n I really don\'t speak to the actors\n It\'s not my role when I\'m working the camera,\n There\'s a very high hierarchy\n It\'s just not my role\n\n\n   the actors   might ask me uh what lens I might have and\n\nthat\'s about it\n That\'s my communication\n I\'ll say move to the right more to the left\n I don\'t know how it effects their psyche\n done the job\n Ya\n It is loud but a lot of times you\'re with a very long lens far\n\naway\n Like one thing you can do with this camera, is put a hundred\n\nand twenty mil  lens,\n Go real far away\n Get a nice, wide to mid shot while this camera is doing a\n\nclose up and run in sync,\n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A>  design for this\n What happens is there\'s no insulation in the

{'text': 'I mean you can do the same technique of sound blankets if this is on a\n\ntripod as you can, with that\n Only this has got a head start,\n Right\n But, okay take a five minute break\n\n\ntape cuts out  \n\n<$A>  Okay so now, that\'s how you load\n When we\'re done you guys can play with mags try loading it, but\n\nthere\'s more you got\n So the next thing to do is to adjust your eye piece to your eye,\n\nthe viewfinder\n There\'s two people who need to have the viewfinder, adjusted the\n\ncamera operator and the camera assistant\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A>  Director, doesn\'t have to see the focus\n There\'s usually video assist, and they\'ll see it through that\n\n<,,>\n The reason why the camera assistant and the camera operator the\n\ncamera operator will see the frame, get the shot but once the shot\'s going\n\n<,,> the shutter moving in front of his eye causes everything to be slightly\n\nsoft anyhow,\n\n And so they can\'t tell if you\'re in focus or not if you\'re the\n\ncamera assistant\n They can tell if you\'re, dramatically out of focus,\n All right\n But they can\'t tell if you\'re slightly softer focus or if you\'re\n\nsharp\n in your\n\nfocus cos it\'s your job as the camera assistant, to get the focus\n So, what I did on this camera is I showed a way to, set the\n\neye pieces\n And I\'ll show you in detail how you get your eye piece\n But what you do is you find a, mark, as a guide mark\n And then, you find focus and you put another piece of tape and\n\nthat\'s yours\n And then you put, the camera operator or the camera assistant in\n\nanother colour\n And don\'t knock this, because if you knock it then, you have\n\nto fight to open it and move it\n his\n\n eye piece\n Hopefully he has the same eyes\n There\'s a lot of latitude in that, for the focus\n But if you\'re the camera assistant and you\'ve just taken some marks\n\nand now you\'ve, gone back    you\'re   done and\n\nit\'s for the camera operator you must put it back to the camera operator\'s\n\neye\n Cos if the camera operator starts looking goes everything\'s out of\n\nfocus check your focus check the focus and you go my focus is fine\n And you go my focus is fine\n\n\n going to   be like hey come on we just lost some time panicking\n\nabout the image, let\'s work here\n The next thing you have to do once you get the focus done is you as\n\na camera assistant must show up on set, with these\n These are cushions, for the eye piece\n if you don\'t show up\n\non set with these it\'s like a big sign of disrespect to your camera operator\n The production should pay for them,\n They cost five dollars apiece\n I have some left over from another production that, you know\n\nI\'ve kept with me in case the next production I go on doesn\'t have them\n\n\nfor one , you sweat, in a hot room,\n If you\'re in that eye piece for sixteen hours a day, for four\n\nweeks, you\'re    going to   have a ring of\n\nacne and   infection \n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A>  This you change every day,\n The next thing is, if it\'s cold out and you sweat your eye then\n\nfreezes to the plastic ,\n\n\naudience laughter stops  you put this on and then they\'ve got an electric\n\nheater inside the eye piece now that when it\'s cold you plug into the camera\n\n<,> and it starts to heat the eye piece,\n But the plastic will still burn the skin, all right from the\n\ncold cos it\'ll freeze so you have to have this on as well\n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A>  This you can buy at Panavision Moliflex Michel Trudel,\n\nwherever you get camera equipment\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  Ya, you take, off the lens, and you aim to the\n\nbrightest light source\n If you don\'t have one, the camera assistant and the camera\n\noperator trade back and forth, shine a flashlight, into the gate\n Warn the person looking through that it\'s going to happen cos it\n\ncould cause retina burn, and then adjust the eye piece, accordingly\n The way you test is go completely out of focus for your eye and\n\nmove into focus on the grid inside the eye piece\n Once that\'s sharp, pass it, then you turn backwards, and\n\nyou\'ll get focused for your eye piece\n\n\nshort, off-topic exchange with a new speaker \n\n<$A>  That\'s the same for every camera,\n Okay it\'s the same mechanism on this, this the new ones out,\n It\'s the same thing\n\n For this camera, to load the lenses, is very simple\n Up here is a little tooth\n I don\'t know if you can see it,\n\n\naudience murmurs \n Okay,\n what you do with that\n\n<,,> is there\'s a hole, so male female and you enter , and that\'s it\n The lens is installed,\n,\n Now the thing with this is that you could put three lenses on,\n your lenses on make sure the\n\ncaps are on even though it is sealed inside\n It\'s just better protection,\n So,\n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A> \n\nth    there\'s    , three ways I\'ve seen the\n\ngate being checked\n Two of them are correct\n first-year and second-year students who don\'t\n\nknow how which is to take the door off, and look in which is, you lose\n\nfilm\n To check the gate it\'s the same way to move the registration pin\n\n<,,>\n Okay\n It moves the shutter, and the pin at the same time,\n Okay\n Now there\'s two ways to check the gate,\n One is to press down on these two, buttons here, that are all\n\nthe way around\n\n\n loosens, the lock\n Slide it out,\n Move the uh shutter so that you can see the film, and there\'s\n\nyour film inside, <unclear> maybe three words </unclear>,\n Okay\n And you can check the gate with a magnifying glass and flashlight\n There\'s another way to check the gate, and I use this one\n\nbecause, it\'s easier to see,\n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A>  Hair dirt dust\n But what happens is when you take the lens off frequently, you\n\nactually allowing dust in\n So the fastest, and best way to check the gate, without a\n\nmagnifying glass is to use the magnifying glass which the lens is,\n So you open the lens up all the way,\n Focus at infinity F-stop here T eight, and then,\n I don\'t know\n I doubt you can see it but, if you look at the right angle with\n\nthe flashlight, you will actually see a magnified version of the plane of\n\nthe film\n And then if you work around each corner, you can see if there\'s\n\nany dirt in the film\n You don\'t have to take anything off the camera,\n You save time and you don\'t allow dust in\n\n<$ZZ> \n\n\n<$A> \n well you\n\n  because you   need a magnifying glass to see a sixteen mil\n\n frame\n There\'s stuff that can be there that you might not see,\n Like this\n If I,\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  No you look in the lens,\n a magnifying glass and I can\n\nsee the entire mechanism, perfectly\n And I can see, now the felt, already ripping through,\n I mean pulled down\n And I would have to clean that out, before I continued to shoot\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  If you look in, look at the very top\n Can you see the top of the film\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A> \n Do you see how there\'s little pieces of, fabric at the top\n\n<$ZD> ,\n\n<$A>  There are\n\n\n<$A>  Well you have to hold the flashlight yourself\n Don\'t look at the glass\n\n\n the big orange \n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  at\n\nthe top  \n\n$ZD> \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A> \n You have to clean these out\n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A>  stick\n\n<$ZE> \n\n<$A>  Ya,\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  You clean it,\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  Ya then you have to take the lens off,\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  No no no\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  Take the lens off\n You clean it with this\n\n<$ZA> ,\n\n<$A> \n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  No\n First, you do,\n Is if,\n example\n the dirt that\'s\n\nthere is actually the felt that\'s inside the camera where the film comes\n\nthrough like that,\n an old camera it\'s\n\nbringing in fabric, after running it for a while\n What you have to do is you take this, and you just clean off\n\n<,> all the way around the gate\n Blow to make sure the dust gets out\n Run it again\n If it reappears, then you take it out and you clean it out\n\n\n<$ZZ> \n\n\n<$A>  No\n Here, and here,\n Okay,\n So that\'s how to check the gate, in the fastest way\n take a look when,\n\nyou\'re done\n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A>  Pardon\n\n<$ZZ>  more question\n\n \n\n<$A> ,\n\n  that\'s   the best way to check the gate\n The only problem is some zoom lenses, the, opening, to\n\nthe gate is so small, and there\'s so many layers of glass to magnify down\n\n<,> that you can\'t see anything, no matter how hard you try\n But with the prime lenses it\'s very simple, to see\n It\'s easy it\'s fast, and it\'s clean,\n Okay\n\n Okay so that\'s how you load the\n lenses\n That\'s how you load the lenses, on this camera\n try go ahead\n a couple\n\nwords </unclear> complicated, is the they way  that  <unclear> a\n\nfew words </unclear>,\n\n<$ZZ> ,\n\n<$A> \n\npronounced Mack-Lite \n\n<$ZZ> \n\n<$A> \n,\n\nthat\'s what they\'re referring to \n\n<$A>  to\n\nlook   to take the lens off   on this, the first thing you\n\nhave to do, is loosen,\n\n Here this outside ring, you have to loosen it and it says in\n\nwhich direction\n It says " loose ", and " fixed\n\n",\n All right,\n Okay\n\n Once it\'s turned it\'s turned and it\'s locked\n So you loosen it\n The next step is to take the lens out,\n going\n\nto   do it here but I\'m going to show you what I\'m going to be doing\n\n<,>\n be pressing this\n\nsilver button here\n Okay\n This silver button here unlocks, the teeth that hold onto the\n\nbayonet mount, inside\n It\'s a different type of lens,\n Okay\n So, all you do, is press this, and it\'s out\n Okay\n It\'s a bayonet,\n\n\n get used to a lot\n\nof military terms\n come into film but magazines\n\nbayonets,\n Okay and to put it in, it\'s the same thing\n You lock, and you close this ring,\n And, you\'re done, and the lens is in\n It\'s tight\n There\'s no problem\n Okay\n That\'s how you load, the lens in\n Now if you\'re using prime lenses on this, all you have to do is\n\ntake the prime lens out\n Put it into a new blimp, which looks like,\n by the way,\n\n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A>  That\'s not the lens\n That\'s a blimp to prevent sound\n Never leave the case on set or anywhere unlocked, or you will\n\nbe kicked off set\n All right\n There\'s just something,\n All you need to do is lock one of them but don\'t leave them\n\nunlocked, unless it\'s open,\n Here\n This is the blimp,\n It\'s to prevent sound\n This one doesn\'t work because there isn\'t a ground glass, which\n\nis a clean piece of glass to send the sound back into the camera\n But you can always take the ground glass from this one and put it\n\nin here\n\n Take the ground glass off and turn this knob',

as Mister  Phelan  put it tip the scales in their favour\n Mick\n\nMillner  do everything\n do not take away someone's liberty\n\nby suspicion or by speculation or by simply tipping the scale in their

evidence both that of the Crown and that of the, defence\n\n<,> if you are not sure then you must acquit my client, of these charges\n Mick\n\nMillner  of these charges,\n of the things that I\n\nmay say to you over the next period of time will be things that perhaps\n\nMister  Phelan  and Mister  Barker  touched on already\n There is no way to get around it\n It's one of the problems that's going to surface\n But those things are important to my client\n In addition to that there are other things that I would like to\n\nbring to your attention,\n Let me begin by saying ladies and gentlemen that the Crown has\n\nparaded before you fifteen witnesses,\n Of those fifteen witnesses three were police officers\n\n\nPiney  the owner of  Riley's \n and\n\nDoctor  Rolston  were not eyewitnesses to what occurred that evening\n\n<,>\n The remaining ten, were eyewitnesses to portions of whatever\n\nhappened on the night of  November the thirty-first  nineteen\n\nninety-two\n Of these ten, seven of them, had, consumed alcohol in\n\nvarying quantities to which would make them, intoxicated to any varying\n\ndegrees,\n Mike\n\nTreadle  had either had nothing to drink or had very little to drink,\n Recall the witnesses comments all of them\n These people were partying\n They were having a good time\n beer\n There was, glasses and pitchers at their table\n They had a glazed look\n They were staggering,\n A couple of them went to the automated teller machine for more\n\nmoney,\n described his friends\n they'd been\n\nthere for awhile drinking  \n Charles\n\n fifteen minutes before I left and he was drunk ,\n Now ladies and gentlemen, I'm not here to, uh create evidence\n\nfor you, and I do make mistakes when I write things down but I do believe\n\nthat those were comments, that I wrote down verbatim from the witnesses\n\n<,,>\n Even these people these seven people admit they were drunk\n\n I was feeling\n\npretty happy \n I had quite a bit to drink over the\n\nwhole evening ,\n I had five vodka specials in two hours\n\n,\n\n\n\n I was feeling  really good  \n Don't for one minute ladies and gentlemen, believe what Mister\n\n Raoul Eto  said <unclear> a few words </unclear> that he was just\n\njoyful that he was <unclear> two words </unclear>\n These individuals, were intoxicated albeit to varying degrees\n\n<,,>\n sug\n\n   I suggest   is somewhat doubtful, not so much\n\nbecause Mister  Treadle     I   think was\n\nintoxicated but because Mister Mister  Treadle  doesn't give a lot of\n\nevidence about much, and the evidence that he does give the actual    eye witness   testimony that he does give\n\n<,> he gives at a point in time where he's upset\n,\n\n Bear that in mind as well ladies and gentlemen of the jury when you\n\nconsider what Mister  Treadle  had to say\n I submit to you that the Crown's strongest witnesses, were two\n\nMister  Fred Avalon , and Mister  Ron Craw \n Together when you take just their testimonies together you have an\n\nexplanation of what happened, right from the fight at the washroom until\n\n<,,> everyone's arrested at the end of the evening,\n can't testify to is what\n\n Mick Millner  was doing out on  Granada  Avenue but  Ron\n\nCraw  can <unclear> a few words </unclear>,\n maybe two\n\nwords </unclear>\n doesn't\n\nknow  Mick Millner \n, he had a connection at one point in time\n word\n\n</unclear> did not work there for a long period of time\n has no reason no reason whatsoever I suggest\n\nto you, to say anything, on behalf of these individuals because he has\n\na vested interest in them, <unclear> a few words </unclear>\n Nothing,\n Nothing at all\n\n The Crown, is going to stand up and is going to say to you I\n\nbelieve is going to say to you that the evidence of these seven people and\n\ntheir testimony coupled with that of these other witnesses that I feel are\n\nstronger, proves beyond a reasonable doubt that  Mick Millner \n\ncommitted the    uh    the  \n\ncrimes   that he has been charged with,\n the witnesses are\n\nsaying, not only contradict each other but contradict what the <unclear>\n\nmaybe two words </unclear>\n\n The Crown wants you to believe the evidence of these people,\n\nover the evidence of four sober people\n Never mind that they're the accused\n They're asking you to believe the evidence of those people over\n\nfour sober people\n That doesn't make any sense to me\n pointed out you don't have to be an\n\nexpert to explain the effects of alcohol\n I'm sure that all of us at one point or another in our lives have\n\nseen someone who was intoxicated\n,\n a few words\n\n</unclear>\n Perhaps you have had a friend that's been intoxicated and think\n\nabout some of the things they ask you, the next day, when you see them\n\nagain\n They say where were we last night,\n I do\n What did I say\n Did I embarrass myself\n Did I embarrass you\n uh a\n\nperson who is intoxicated uh will have questions about the next day\n Well, what does that show\n a few words\n\n</unclear> but to a certain extent alcohol will cloud a person's memory,\n\nand effect their recall\n There's no question of that,\n Ladies and gentlemen the Crown's evidence that they are trying to\n\nor that they are entering before you is just that it's evidence of seven key\n\nwitnesses that's tainted by alcohol,\n Ask yourself this question, who is going to have a better\n\nrecollection a clearer recollection of past events, someone who was sober\n\nat the time or someone who was drunk,\n I think the answer to that question is obvious,\n Now don't get me wrong\n I'm not saying, that the witnesses are lying\n I'm not saying that by any stretch of the imagination\n I'm simply saying, that they are confused\n Their memories are cloudy,\n They're confused about the sequence of events\n Maybe they're confused about who they saw doing what,\n And to a certain extent, on some occasions they are confused as\n\nto who was  actually  <unclear> word </unclear>,\n Let's examine the evidence now ladies and gentlemen\n\n\n situations   but since I'm defending  Mick Millner  I have\n\nto add a fifth one\n seems to me\n\nthat there are five areas\n The first one is the washroom,\n The second one is the coat check area,\n Avenue,\n Street,\n\n\nMick  did something on  Ninety-Third  Street\n And finally the hallway incident,\n Let's start with that washroom incident,\n Who actually saw what went on in there,\n Think about that when you're analyzing the whole situation,\n, he says he got hit\n\nin the side of the head\n He got a couple more blows\n He doesn't know who hit him,\n who's sitting right there at the table the\n\ntable above the area where this fight   , was  \n\nuh taking place he's watching the whole thing, what he says is    uh all the big guys   did was pull everyone apart\n\nand take them to the coat check,\n That's all they did,\n a\n\nlittle   a little   ways away\n and one guy\n\nwent after  Raoul \n\n one guy\n\nup against the railing\n Neither guy threw any punches,\n he\n\nsaw  Mick    run in but he couldn't see much because there\n\nwere people in the way\n,\n But these other four people\n You'll note, of these other four people not one not one of\n\nthose people said that any of these big guys or any of the  barmen  or\n\nany of the accused, hit Mister  Raoul Eto , not one,\n Now we know from the testimony right it appears from the evidence\n\nin the testimony that Mister  Eto  was bleeding at this point in time\n\neither from his mouth or his  ear \n\n,\n hit him\n\n According to the testimony that I just read just a few portions\n\n<unclear> three or four words </unclear> was one of the other  questions\n\n,\n was not involved at this point in time\n\n<,,>\n\n\nfrom   the washroom   area to the coat check area, most\n\npeople think nothing happened,\n was whisked away\n And I believe the evidence of the accused is that it was Mister uh\n\n<,>  Wasylesko  Mister  Frank Wasylesko  and Mister  Johnny\n\nSteen  took him to the coat check and then  Mick  followed them up\n Wanda\n\nWishaw  who say that something happened in that hallway\n right in front\n\nof their table, down there on the <unclear> word </unclear> down on the\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n And I believe one of them indicated that they thought that it was\n\n Mick Millner  or I D'd  Mick Millner  as the fellow that had\n\nhim there although that particular lady couldn't say whether or not <unclear>\n\ntwo words </unclear>\n\n\nwhat those two ladies  </} saw actually did take place but it di dn't\n\ntake place right there in the hallway\n It took place up at the coat check area,\n These ladies were sitting there\n They were looking down the hallway\n\n That's where they saw it\n That's where that happened\n get into an altercation\n\n<,> with my client, at the coat check area\n So, there's just one example of how, what they're saying may\n\nnot be\n I'm not saying that it's not correct but I'm saying\n\nthat they're mistaking as to where exactly that happened,\n I suggest to you ladies and gentlemen that occurred at the coat\n\ncheck area,\n didn't have any reason whatsoever\n\nto hit Mister  Eto   at  that point\n None whatsoever\n He didn't have any reason at all\n Nothing to do with it\n When he got to the situation everything was under control,\n,\n My client got up on the stand, and told you what happened at\n\nthe coat check area,\n contrast what\n\nmy client had to say about what happened at the

said\n was on the other side of the street\n\nwith  Charles   \n\n\nAvenue, between  Mick  and  Chalres ,\n\n I know those words are still in your mind,\n kicking,\n\npunching or hitting  Charles   ,\n said,\n seem like the end of\n\na like I said     an   emotional outburst from\n\nMister  Craw ,\n And that, ladies and gentlemen is exactly what my client said\n\nhe was doing\n Avenue, got there,\n Frank\n\nWasylesko ,\n was holding onto him\n Pulled her away\n\n Turned him around, and walked back into the bar\n,\n\nbut you know he could have been dazed <unclear> maybe three words

going to suggest to you, that, my client\n\nmust have done something out there because  Charles Montebank  was\n\nunconscious at this point in time and because,  Charles Montebank \n\ndoesn't remember anything that happened between that time and the time he\n\ncame back to the back hallway, but, ask yourself these questions\n say to\n\nhim ,  come on you're under arrest ,\n Why would he talk to

was no bouncing of the head on the pavement like a\n\nbasketball, no shaking anyone\n,\n also, saw what happenedthen\n\n,\n freaking out\n That's what he remembers\n Why was he so upset,\n He's upset because, his friends got kicked out of the bar\n\nbecause his friends are causing problems and  even now  Mick  has\n\nbrought them  back into the bar to face the music,\n Now who's telling the truth here\n Mister\n\n  uh Mister   uh,  Charles Montebank \n\n\nRaoul's  head\n All we have is what the doctor said\n The doctor says that he noticed a bruising on either side of the\n\nhead",

{'text': "<$A>  Thank you my lord\n mentioned\n\nearlier when I made my opening remarks that I'd later on have a, chance to\n\nspeak with you in a little more detail,\n That's obviously what I'm going to do now,\n had raised, a number of points and I quite\n\nfrankly don't intend to go over them all again,\n What I did want to do is kind of, give you one comment he had\n\nmade\n During my summation to you, I too will be referring to evidence\n I'm going to be referring to evidence that, I recollect being\n\nsaid that I think is important based on what I, want to speak to you about\n And I just want to raise the same points he did\n It's that you're the ones who determine what the evidence is,\n Not me,\n Not the judge,\n It's you,\n And if I say anything that you don't recall, you win\n word\n\n</unclear> because, the way this case started I believe we definitely\n\ngave you council's remarks they're not evidence and this is not evidence\n When the trial started, the judge told you you would hear the\n\nevidence\n You would then hear the summation\n What's going to happen now, is that I'm going to go over,\n\nevidence that I think is important\n\n and\n\nMister  Lister  will have the opportunity to address you\n on behalf of the Crown will have the\n\nopportunity to address you\n And ultimately the judge will give you some instructions,\n What I'd ask at this time, is that you, just give me maybe\n\nten or fifteen minutes, of your attention while I go over things that I\n\nfeel are important, on behalf of  Herbert Wasylesko ,\n Phelan\n\n had made when he was  standing chatting  with you\n is an innocent\n\nman, unless and until you say otherwise\n Point number one\n You have to be satisfied of his guilt, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt\n made and I, want to\n\ncome back to, my client has absolutely, no onus, to establish to\n\nyou\n\n\nHerbert Wasylesko  's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\n\n\nI suggest <unclear> maybe three words </unclear> ladies and gentlemen,\n Not one of the witnesses that you have heard over the last two\n\nweeks, have stated, that they saw  Herbert Wasylesko  kick or\n\nstrike  Raoul Eto \n Now, I point out to you\n This is another reason I'll be summing up shorter I anticipate than\n\nmy friend\n Simply this\n My client faces one charge,\n and in that assault bodily harm\n\nwas caused\n That's the case in a nutshell\n The judge will go into more detail with you\n Raoul Eto\n\n,\n And none of the witnesses not even the Crown witnesses,\n The Crown bears the onus of proof\n Herbert Wasylesko\n\n do, what he's charged with\n by the\n\nCrown witnesses is that there were a lot of people present, throughout\n\nthat evening apart from the  employees , and there was a lot of\n\nalcohol being  involved \n pointed out the obvious,\n\n They were there doing their job,\n You've heard a number of witnesses over the last two weeks\n And I certainly don't intend to review everything they've said\n As I mentioned my client faces one count\n If I were to review all the evidence in two weeks I might be here\n\ntwo weeks doing it,\n But I do want to touch briefly on the evidence, of some of the\n\nwitnesses kind of separate the wheat from the chaff as it were, for your\n\nconsideration,\n In doing this, I've decided to kind of break this whole thing\n\ndown into what I call four separate, occurrences\n\n\nwashroom area ,\n The next thing, you heard was about an incident at the coat\n\ncheck area kind of at the front door\n Avenue\n\nafter Mister  Eto  left  the fire  and  ran  away\n in the hallway\n And I think in fairness that, may be a good way to look at this\n\ncase, if I go through it on behalf of  Herbert  and deal with each\n\nof those areas\n I want to start of course with the disturbance at the washroom\n took the stand,\n\nand his evidence was that he was at the front door area taking the cover\n\ncharge when he heard about this initial  skirmish \n He said he came partly down the hall\n,\n Saw matters were under control and at that point returned to his\n\nduties\n, confirmed the scuffle by the washroom\n\n<,,> but I believe he said he couldn't see anything\n There was a crowd of people around,\n you recall testified about this initial\n\nscuffle,\n Silverman\n\n said\n himself confirms that\n And although he did state he didn't recall being involved, in a\n\nfight with a person he had pulled off I believe he does state that his mouth\n\n   was   bleeding at that time,\n Johnny Steen\n\n saying that they brought Mister  Eto  up towards the coat check\n\narea and I believe  Herbert Wasylesko  said basically the same thing\n\n\nabsolutely nothing that connects my client  Herbert  with anything in\n\nthat initial skirmish\n I don't intend to talk about it anymore,\n Second one, the incident by the coat check\n I think it's fairly clear that something occurred there\n We've had different stories from different people, but virtually\n\nall the witnesses that I just referred to confirm that there was something\n\nthat went on at the coat check area\n I don't think that's in dispute\n, the manager you recall he was very clear\n\nin stating, that when he came upon this he didn't see the beginning of it\n holding\n\nan individual <unclear> two words </unclear>\n\n\nRaoul Eto ,\n\n\nHerbert  say to this person  just relax just settle down \n\nthat there was no real fight there\n loosely holding\n\n<unclear> a few words </unclear> Mister  Eto ,\n I suggest to you ladies and gentlemen what we have there is simply\n\nthis  Herbert  doing his job, doing what's required of him doing\n\nnothing more nothing less\n\n\nthreatening, or intimidating, Mister  Eto \n being angry\n doing any\n\nviolence whatsoever\n I'm going to come back to that,\n But as far as that second incident goes, again I suggest that\n\nthere's absolutely nothing here to suggest that  Herbert Wasylesko \n\nwas in any way dealing with <unclear> a few words </unclear>\n I don't intend to go further than that,\n The third area, is, I guess we'll all refer to it as the\n\noutside  incident \n was\n\nthe individual involved in apprehending Mister  Eto , but I'd like\n\nyou to consider, the following evidence from the following witnesses\n\n Number one, they do tend to acknowledge that it's quite\n\npossible that there were five or six people chasing after Mister  Eto \n I believe he also stated not all those people were doormen,\n In fact I believe he, specifically stated there were some other\n\npeople involved who were not doormen\n I'd ask you to think carefully on that evidence when you're make\n\nyour deliberations,\n,\n referred to, a bunch of guys, going\n\nafter  Raoul Eto \n, inferred there was a major commotion\n\nwith lots of people around and it was possible six people went, after\n\nMister  Eto ,\n word\n\n</unclear> was that, she kind of went outside with the flow of people\n\n<unclear> a few words </unclear>\n She did state there were a number of people outside,\n,\n said there were at least four or five\n\npeople who went out the door,\n was sitting in this\n\ncourtroom in open trial Mister  Craw  did not identify him as one of\n\nthe individuals he saw  kicking  Mister  Eto \n\n was wearing a\n\nwhite t-shirt,\n inferences\n\n and I'd like you to think of this,\n according to the evidence of himself\n\nand Mister  Avalon   and I believe   Frank  was at the\n\nfront door taking cover charges that evening,\n, Mister\n\n Herbert Wasylesko  had Mister  Craw   to deal  with as\n\nhe came in\n How could he not\n is not able to\n\nsay  Herbert Wasylesko  was ultimately doing anything to Mister \n\nEto \n completely denies it\n\n<,,>\n is one of\n\nthose witnesses, who wasn't as drunk, as the rest of the  crowd was\n\n\n\n\nHerbert Wasylesko  as kicking Mister  Eto  is because Mister \n\nHerbert Wasylesko  was not kicking Mister  Eto \n\n\nto look at is this common because I believe he said, when he was out in\n\nthe street, he heard a lot of yelling about a knife,\n The knife was a concern\n knew the knife was a concern\n other people\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n, again another Crown witness, his\n\nevidence was, that he heard people on the street,\n Goes around the corner\n Raoul\n\nEto ,\n standing there\n\n\njust   couldn't identify that person,\n And he also referred to a crowd of people\n\n\nand   recall what he said\n I thought that his indication was that there were about, ten\n\npeople outside when he went out there\n So we've obviously got a fairly large crowd of people around\n\nMister  Eto ,\n Herbert Wasylesko\n\n  hold the knife \n John\n\nSteen , in getting  Raoul Eto  to his <unclear> word </unclear>\n\n<,> bringing him back into the building\n also said a little bit later that evening\n\nthis is as I understand the evidence just shortly after all of this \n\nCharles Montebank  goes into his office\n Charles\n\nMontebank  out there as well as  Herbert Wasylesko ,\n,\n, was that there\n\nwere, he used the words  a lot of guys there , when he\n\nwas talking about this thing on

this\n went out the door,\n out the door, yelling\n\nabout a knife\n himself goes out the door\n Why does he go out the door\n To find the knife,\n He did find the knife,\n had\n\nthe knife,",

else left around unaccounted for\n yes I was in the\n\ncoat check \n And, there's not one witness, Crown or defence not one\n\nwitness here who has  Herbert Wasylesko     in\n\nthat   hallway, kicking or striking  Raoul Eto \n The evidence is he's in there twice,\n\n\nEto  in with  John Steen \n said that\n\nthat hallway area was to be used if you will as a detention area a holding\n\ncell until the police came\n He brings him in\n The situation's under control\n He leaves\n When does he come back\n He comes back when the police are coming in to help his brother to\n\npick up  Raoul Eto  to have him ready for the police to arrest\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n is in the room,\n\n\nto   to   deal with\n And I'm sure, like I said there's certainly more evidence\n I mean I haven't tried to condense the trial, into fifteen\n\nminutes\n But I want to now briefly turn to, a few other kind of overall\n\nthings\n Just when you're assessing the whole case and what makes sense and\n\nwhat doesn't there's a couple things I'd like you to think about,\n mentioned a bit\n\nearlier,\n Most of the Crown witnesses had been drinking,\n Now certainly the five, involved if you will\n\n\n<,,>\n that\n\nMister  Montebank  was actually staggering,\n had indicated that everybody there\n\nwas having a good time\n\n 's behaviour that night\n Can you infer from his behaviour that he was sober,\n The point is this, what we've got is five individuals at the\n\ntable for sure who are fairly drunk and that is obviously going to affect\n\ntheir recollection, of a lot of events\n had gone\n\nthrough some of those things\n et cetera\n That's something to keep in mind\n You've got, the Crown witnesses are all drunk\n Defence witnesses are all sober\n They're there doing their job,\n,\n, was there in the room\n The police come in, and what does he say to them then,\n Nothing\n Now let's be logical here\n had been subjected to a vicious beating in\n\nthat room, why wouldn't he right away as soon as the police come, in\n\nstart hollering about it\n He's not hollering about it\n They have to put him in cuffs to get him out\n Why did they put him in cuffs\n I think we can infer he was upset,\n He was still rambunctious\n He was mad\n He was drunk\n He was furious\n\n\ncomes by\n Walker\n\n ladies and gentlemen who said  Yeah I knew when we were going\n\nback that arrests were going to be made \n What do we got here\n coming to arrest\n He knows there's been an incident with a knife\n\n I believe walks him under his own\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n back\n Who's he arresting,\n He's arresting people,\n has identified\n identifying,\n Anybody working that night\n\n\nevidence\n He has never identified, the people who he says are doing,\n\nthis supposed violence to him\n did\n\nanything to me\n\n\nCharles Montebank ,\n has the opportunity to talk to, an\n\nintoxicated Mister  Eto  an intoxicated Mister  Montebank  an\n\nintoxicated,  partner  and the intoxicated <unclear> two words\n\n</unclear> and goes roaring back, and arrests everybody\n Now think about this,\n\n\nReif \n gave the knife\n\nto Constable  Reif \n Where did the knife go\n\n I believe he said he has put it in his pocket,\n did have, notes\n\n<unclear> a few words </unclear> that night\n two words\n\n</unclear>\n have notes of everything that has\n\nhappened  in the back ,\n who gave him the knife\n That doesn't make sense\n does it\n goes up to him, when he first comes into the\n\nroom gives him the knife,\n I want to get this\n\n Raoul Eto  arrested and out of here because of what he's done \n\nhere today  ,\n do that\n If he'd done something wrong that night, if he'd done\n\nsomething wrong that night, he wouldn't want to be anywhere around,\n\nConstable  Reif  when he came in\n He wouldn't want to try to explain what happened,\n Phelan\n\n put to you\n He'd want to disassociate himself,\n,\n again\n stated he had the knife with him for the\n\npurposes of self-defence\n But I remind you ladies and gentlemen one person that night was\n\nwielding a knife,\n\n That had nothing to do, with self-defence\n the kind of a man, you'll recall who defends\n\nhimself with his mouth, and then he  bites the guy ,\n\n\nstuck  the knife into the tire certainly not in self-defence and  he's\n\nrunning  around outside, the establishment with a knife\n goes out to assist\n 's boss\n goes out to assist\n They're going to get and find the guy with the knife bring him\n\nback in and let the police deal with him\n And what does all the evidence point to happening\n finds the knife\n Eto\n\n back in and the police come,\n That's exactly consistent, with everything that all the\n\nwitnesses stated,\n The point I raised earlier\n Herbert\n\nWasylesko , was holding Mister  Eto  at the front area, the\n\ncoat check you recall\n Herbert\n\nWasylesko  who was at that point, at the coat check area, calm\n\ndoing his job, restraining somebody who wants to get involved in a little\n\nbit of a fracas all of the sudden bang going crazy,\n All of the sudden, he changes from being, a corny expression\n\nI'll use it anyway a clean-cut young man\n Two and a half years university\n for years\n He's a businessman\n He's got his own establishment\n All of the sudden this guy who not two minutes before was\n\nreasonable and acting appropriately, goes crazy, in conjunction I\n\npoint out, with three other individuals,\n It's just unbelievable\n It just doesn't make sense\n act that\n\nway,\n I'd like to touch on\n\nladies and gentlemen at this point, he's given you some estimates of time\n\nthroughout the course of the <unclear> word </unclear> which I'd suggest to\n\nyou are just totally, just totally <unclear> word </unclear>\n he said\n\nhe had been at <unclear> word </unclear> for about an hour and a half when\n\nthe first skirmish broke out,\n All the other witnesses I thought indicated that time frame was\n\nabout three hours,\n It felt like I was in that\n\nhallway ten or fifteen minutes before the police arrived \n to\n\nwhen Constable  Reif  <unclear> word </unclear> there\n down the hallway\n He got there right away\n\n\nRaoul Eto  the benefit of  the doubt , it's certainly clear\n\nthat his recollection, is unreliable,\n\n\nPhelan  said,\n In summary, ladies and gentlemen I just leave you with this\n\n<,,> I suggest it's very clear very clear on all the evidence you've heard\n\nover past weeks that  Herbert Wasylesko  is an innocent man and had\n\nnothing to do with anything\n I ask you to return a verdict acquitting him of the charges he's\n\nfacing, \n\n<$B>  Okay thank you my lord\n Ladies and gentlemen of the jury\n This is the second time that I've had the pleasure of addressing\n\nyou and it is the final time that I get to address you and explain to you and\n\nset forth for you what my client <unclear> word </unclear> in this case\n And ladies and gentlemen, if I recall back to my opening I\n\nbelieve I neglected to introduce myself at that point in time\n Let me take that opportunity now\n\n and Company based in\n\n Macaroon  and my client is Mister  Mick Millner ,\n When you were sworn as jurors in this case each of you undertook a\n\nduty to give  Mick Millner  not just  Mick Millner  to give all\n\nof the  accused   a fair trial\n anxious\n\n consideration, and accord him a fair trial and afford him the same\n\npresumption of innocence and the same benefit of a reasonable doubt that you\n\nif you any of you were in this <unclear> word </unclear> would have a right\n\nto expect at the hands of twelve of your uh fellow citizens\n These principles of the presumption of innocence of reasonable\n\ndoubt that myself and Mister  Phelan  before me and Mister  Barker\n\n before me and I'm sure Mister  Fincher  after me will,\n\nindicate to you have been tried and tested in our courts of law and they have\n\nwithstood all challenges\n Anyone can be charged with a criminal offence, and they may\n\nvery well be innocent,\n That is why the jury system is one of the cornerstones of our,\n\nsociety\n The jury system stands between the power and the state and the\n\nmembers of the public\n\n\nword </unclear>\n In a very short while ladies and gentlemen you will you twelve\n\npeople will retire to commence the serious duty that you're sworn or\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> to undertake\n\n\nimportant decision will affect my client's life\n There's no question about that,\n Where are you going to begin\n Where do you begin with the examination\n Our system of justice gives

facts in this case\n\n\nCrown counsel, have reviewed the facts at some length, and that is\n\ntheir responsibility and duty as counsel,\n But what they have said about the facts, based, on the\n\nevidence can either be accepted by you, or rejected by you,\n It is for you alone, to make that determination,\n Now for the purpose of assisting you, I'm going to go over some\n\nof the evidence as I recollect it,\n But if you disagree with my recollection, of the evidence, it\n\nis the way that you recollect the evidence, and not the way, that I\n\nrecollect it, that is important,\n Because I have said previously you are the sole, judge of the\n\nfacts,\n Now nothing, and I underline that nothing has been proven in\n\nthis case, until you the members of the jury, make a determination that\n\nit has, been proven,\n As I go through the evidence I may say that this has been proven\n\n<,> or that has been proven, or draw your attention to a certain piece of\n\nevidence which I think is <unclear> two or three words </unclear>,\n Or I may say that this is a fact or that is a fact\n But unless I say to you categorically that this is a matter of law\n\n<,> that I speak, then I'm  not incorrect  in stating that anything\n\nhas been established, because nothing has been established until you the\n\nmembers of the jury, have made that decision,\n I may suggest to you that certain inferences and conclusions can be\n\ndrawn from the facts, so that you will have little difficulty in arriving\n\nat a certain conclusion\n\n\nsome detail,\n But in the end it is up for you and you alone as to whether any\n\ninference should be drawn, or any conclusion should be drawn or if a\n\nfact's proven,\n And you are only to consider the evidence that was presented to you\n\n<,> from the witness box    and   nothing else,\n You are not to consider anything that you may have heard outside\n\nthe courtroom,\n The decision on which evidence you accept as credible, or worthy\n\nof belief is entirely for you to make,\n, is a matter,\n\nof determining, credibility\n It is for you to decide which witnesses and which evidence you\n\naccept and which evidence you reject,\n You may accept a portion of the evidence as I stated in my opening\n\n<,> given by a witness or you may reject it\n\n\n  you may   reject parts of it,\n two or three words\n\n</unclear>\n Now an honest witness can sometimes be mistaken,\n And when a number of different people observe a particular event\n\n<,> and that is especially so when there is  a  stress  involved\n\n, people sometimes see things, differently,\n differences in evidence may indicate to you,\n\nthat the witnesses did not get together and manufacture or rehearse the story\n You may consider that a healthy sign or in the alternative you may\n\ndecide, that a witness or witnesses are deliberately, trying, to\n\ndeceive\n That's for you to say, if this honest witness may be telling the\n\ntruth in some part of his or her evidence,\n You are also entitled to make reasonable deductions, and draw\n\nreasonable inferences and conclusions from the facts, which you accept out\n\nof the evidence, given in this trial,\n I must also emphasize, the position, of an expert, witness\n\n<,>\n\n\nSeuss ,\n An expert is a witness who by reason of special, skill, and\n\ntraining is able to give opinion  evidence  within his or her,\n\nfield,\n An expert witness who gives his or her opinion, is no different\n\n<,> from any other witness, as far as your right to accept or reject all\n\nor part of the evidence, is concerned\n You can accept the opinion of the expert, but if in your\n\nopinion the facts indicate a different result, you are to, take your\n\nopinion, and reject the expert  opinion \n And if on any matter the expert is wrong in your view, if you\n\ndraw a different conclusion,  \n\n than that of the expert  , you have the absolute, right,\n\nto do so\n responsibility\n,\n\nreasonable and, inclement,\n And this is a case where you should exercise your good\n\nold-fashioned common sense,\n You are entitled to draw from your experiences in life and your\n\nassociations in life, your knowledge of life and that of your fellow,\n\ncitizens\n common\n\n - fashioned, fashioned   good old-fashioned common sense \n\n,\n It's so important,\n,\n Now as mentioned by counsel, this is a very very, important\n\n   cornerstone \n\n in our democracy  and  Canadian law, that the accused in this\n\ncase we have three of them, come into this court, as innocent men,\n The law presumes them to be innocent, as to these charges sorry\n\n I suppose  that should be this charge, I'm sorry there's only one\n\ncharge, until the charge has been proven by the Crown, beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt,\n Now under our legal system there is absolutely no obligation on\n\nthe accused, to prove their innocence \n They don't have to prove anything,\n they did testify in this\n\ncase but  there's no obligation   whatsoever, for them    to   go on the stand and tell their stories,\n The Crown must prove each and every ingredient of the offence,\n\nnecessary to sustain the charge, beyond a reasonable doubt,\n And that burden, through the trial, never shifts\n It's on the Crown at the start of the trial, throughout the\n\ntrial, and it's on the Crown right now,\n And I said before the Crown must establish the guilt of the\n\naccused to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt,\n And those are, critical words in this case\n,\n And in most criminal cases that is the most important aspect,\n\nof the case\n I'm going to repeat that phrase, over and over again in my\n\ncharge, and    I should   say, to\n\nyour satisfaction and meets your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt,\n brings us to the\n\nquestion, what is a reasonable doubt\n What do those words mean,\n The words reasonable and the word doubt, they're ordinary words\n\n<,>\n on\n\nour   everyday lives,\n They're not magical or

{'text': '<$A>  But you must recognize that a reasonable doubt is not a\n\nfanciful doubt, or a figment of your imagination,\n up to\n\nmake our job a little easier\n Reasonable doubt must have real, substance\n good old common sense\n\nwhich I mentioned earlier, in my charge\n The Crown must prove the guilt of the accused as I have said beyond\n\na reasonable doubt and not on the mere balance of probability,\n If the Crown fails to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, then it is your obligation as jurors and your duty to\n\nacquit,\n Reasonable doubt has to be an honest doubt\n Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is that degree of proof which\n\nconvinces the mind, and satisfies the conscience\n The law does not require that the charge be proved against the\n\naccused to a degree of absolute certainty, but if there is a reasonable\n\ndoubt on anything during the trial and I mean anything it must be resolved in\n\nfavour of the accused,\n you must\n\n  you must   deal with today, but applies to all the\n\nevidence and to any intermediate questions that you might ask yourselves,\n\nas you proceed along towards your verdict,\n\n\n   succinctly  , rather than the, lengthy\n\ndefinition I gave  to  you\n, and I\n\nthink that\'s as good a definition, as any\n If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether or not to believe a\n\nwitness, the benefit of the doubt must go to the accused,\n If after weighing or considering carefully all the evidence you\n\nhave an abiding conviction, amounting to a moral certainty that the\n\naccused has committed the offence, for which he is charged,  and\n\nthere\'re  three accused in this case, and there can be no reasonable\n\ndoubt then you must convict\n But if you are wavering, or if you are unable to come to an\n\nabiding conviction, or    if you   have some\n\nlingering or nagging doubt with respect to the proof of some essential\n\nelement, of the offence, then you must give that doubt to the accused\n\n<,> and it is your duty, to  acquit \n In criminal trials, ladies and gentlemen the jury\'s verdict,\n\nmust, be, unanimous,\n This does not mean that you must reach a verdict\n But in order to reach a verdict of guilty with respect to, each\n\nof the accused, you must be unanimous,\n To reach a verdict of not guilty with respect to each of the\n\naccused you must also, be, unanimous,\n If it happens that one or more of you cannot agree with the others\n\nafter you have conscientiously applied yourself to the task, then there\n\ncan be no verdict and you must then  ultimately  report that  fact\n\n , to me,\n But you must not abandon your own conscience or conclusions just\n\nfor the sake, of reaching a, verdict,\n Now in this case I\'m satisfied that you will all apply yourselves\n\ndiligently and conscientiously to the task  and that\n\nyou\'ll be able to reach a verdict\n But you must bear in mind that the responsibility is on the Crown\n\nto    establish  \n\nthe guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, to the satisfaction of\n\neach, and every one of you,\n If the accused is to be found guilty each of you individually must\n\nagree that sufficient proof, and necessary proof has been presented so you\n\ncan <unclear> one or two words </unclear> arrive at that conclusion\n Now those are my general remarks ladies and gentlemen of the jury\n\n\nspecific charge that\'s,  ,  before you \n\n today, \n and uh\n\nit\'s referred to legally as the indictment, and that\'s the document that\n\nyou will take into the jury room,\n charge\n And it reads you\'ll recall the clerk reading it out at the start of\n\nthe case\n\n Now that\'s the charge,\n provision\n\n<,> of Canadian Criminal Code <unclear> rest of utterance </unclear> \n the\n\nessential, ingredients of the offence\n the Crown, to succeed on the charge\n\n<,> it must prove beyond a reasonable doubt,  the following ingredients\n\n\n, first the identity of the accused, and that\n\n<unclear> two or three words </unclear> any issue in this case that\'s for you\n\nto decide, but    they all   testified,\n Secondly the time and place of the event as set out, in the\n\nindictment\n we\'re\n\n going to have any difficulty in respect to the time <unclear> soft word\n\nor pause </unclear> place\n Three, that the accused applied force directly or indirectly to\n\nthe, complainant,  Sarah ,\n intended to apply force, to the\n\ncomplainant,\n\n\nSarah , did not, consent, to the application of  the \n\nforce, and that the accused knew, that the victim, did not consent\n,\n\nis that the assault, was of a sexual, nature,\n Now I\'m going to deal with one or two of the ingredients that need\n\nmore detailed instructions,\n One of the ingredients that I talked about was that the Crown must\n\nprove that the accused applied force directly or indirectly, to  Sarah\n\n\n And " force " simply means physical, contact\n You can be forced without physical violence\n In other words this ingredient, has proved if you are satisfied\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, that force,   , was\n\napplied  ,\n The next ingredient, is the matter of intention,\n The Crown must prove, that the accused intended to apply,\n\nforce to  Sarah \n And if people intend to do things they do them deliberately\n and do\n\nthings accidentally \n When people do things accidentally, they do not intend to do\n\nthem <unclear> a few words </unclear> charge,\n Now the next matter that I want to touch on is what is meant by a\n\n<,> sexual, assault\n An assault is sexual when the person who commits the assault,\n\ndoes so for the purpose of gratifying his or her sexual appetite\n\n\nCanada, and I\'ll read to you two paragraphs, to give you, a little\n\nmore detail, as to what is <unclear> maybe a word </unclear> meant by a\n\nsexual assault\n Judge reads aloud\n\nfrom ruling \n The intent or purpose of the person committing the act to\n\nthe extent which it may appear from the evidence may also be a factor\n\n\n\n\n<,> and    you   should also consider, the\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>\n When a person consents to being touched, that consent will only\n\ncover  the  certain amount of touching\n It does not cover touching that goes beyond the consent\n For example supposing a person agrees to be kissed,\n That consent would only cover, kissing\n It does not cover something further for example petting or\n\nintercourse,\n going\n\nto    have to decide <unclear> word </unclear> all the evidence\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> consent <unclear> word </unclear> this case\n Now considering whether the conduct was sexual,\n If the motive of the accused is sexual gratification to the extent\n\nthat this <unclear> word </unclear> appear from the evidence, it may be a\n\nfactor in determining whether the conduct,  is  sexual,\n the\n\nreal issue, is, whether you believe,  Sarah  or the, three\n\naccused\n accept the evidence of\n\n Sarah  that  Roger  had intercourse with her without consent\n\n<,> and that  Peter  had anal intercourse again, without her\n\nconsent\n\n\nthe ,  those   two incidents, ah that she

{'text': '<$A>  Thank you ladies and gentlemen for being so attentive\n The uhm, duty you have here is, obviously a great\n\nresponsibility and, certainly my client appreciates, ah your <unclear>\n\nword </unclear> in this regard and,\n, probably the\n\nhighest duty that, can uhm, be placed upon citizens in this country,\n\nand that is, giving judgment, upon one of their fellow citizens, on\n\ncharges of murder\n\n\nresponsibility  that could be, cast upon the shoulders of any person\n\n<,>\n\n\nthere\'s a charge of murder, we <unclear> three or four words </unclear>\n\n<,> at that point someone  is dead \n And, quite frankly my remarks are, extremely focused\n in on, those aspects that,\n\nsubconsciously, one has to overcome the idea because, we\'re not\n\naccustomed to having uh, bodies that die by trauma\n, It\'s all very, uh unnatural and unusual\n mean that a crime was committed\n\n There\'s no crime committed unless, you twelve people decide that\n\nthere was a crime committed\n, That, uhm\n three\n\nwords </unclear> then there\'s no crime\n It\'s as simple as that\n two\n\nwords </unclear> even asked himself to <unclear> two words </unclear>\n\nsomething that he <unclear> two words </unclear>,\n you ask\n\nyourself again that he shouldn\'t have done anything wrong\n But I suggest that, when you\'re confronted with the stark\n\nreality afterwards, a dead body, and something that\'s referred to as a\n\n<,> murder weapon, <unclear> four or five words </unclear> crime,\n, there is no, murder weapon\n\n<,> yet\n,\n He was killed by a hammer,\n But, that doesn\'t make it murder\n we shouldn\'t talk about,\n\n" after the murder " or " the murder weapon\n\n",\n Unless, you jurors decide that it was a murder, it was simply\n\n<,> a death, and, the hammer was the instrument which, effected that\n\n<,,>\n Now, moving onto, uh the second issue, which, like the\n\njudge <unclear> two or three words </unclear>,\n The, most, fundamental, of all rules in our justice\n\nsystem, which makes us as a civilized society quite different from,\n\nsome societies that at least uhm, from my opinion,    for whatever   it\'s worth are less civilized because\n\n<,> that is the rule that  the power  for the state, to convict one\n\nof its citizens, of a crime, that they must show beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, that a crime was perpertrated and perpertrated, by the accused\n\n<,> beyond a reasonable doubt\n the ruling in many places\n In many places, the, tribunal, gets to interrogate the\n\naccused, often, in a, less than satisfactory manner, and there\n\nis no, burden on the state to prove guilt but rather   \n\nthe   accused must, convince the uh tribunal that they\'re \n\ninnocent \n And, the idea of proving something beyond a reasonable doubt\n\n<,>\n What makes sense is the state, should have to prove, that the\n\naccused is guilty,\n I may be\n\nwrong but, I\'d suggest something that, you really have to keep in the\n\nforefront of your mind, is not to do it on the balance of probability,\n, the thing that\n\nwould, be the most likely way to decide something\n, What\'s more probable,\n a case\n\n where someone is on trial for a criminal matter, on, any issue\n\nsuch as, a defence, such as self-defence, or, uh whether or not\n\nthe accused did something, uhm the burden is on the state to show this\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt\n that\n\n<,> in  essence , you must be sure,\n Rather than just guessing at which is most likely, you must be\n\nsure, in order for you to decide something,\n\n So in other words, dealing with, what really is, the key\n\nissue in the case that, the defence <unclear> two words </unclear>,\n\nthat being self-defence,\n word\n\n</unclear>  review  <unclear> two or three words </unclear> issues that\n\nI  project  bear on the issue of self-defence, that,\n One of those is the accused taking the witness stand and telling\n\nyou that she acted in self-defence,\n And, as I mentioned before she testified and I\'ll mention again\n\nyou can, feel <unclear> word </unclear>\n, You don\'t have to feel, that she\'s probably right,\n five or six\n\nwords </unclear> sure that she\'s not telling the truth, <unclear> two\n\nwords </unclear> yourself that you could <unclear> two or three words\n\n</unclear> it\n, It\'s possible, merely possible, that what she says about\n\nself-defence is correct\n\n\nit  is clean and clear\n spend any time\n\ndeliberating at that point,\n there\'s\n\ndefinitely  a reasonable possibility, that she acted in self-defence\n\n<,> then your duty is very clear\n\n\nverdict in \n Not guilty,\n And you have done your duty,\n And justice has been served,\n And if you were to do anything else, justice would die in your\n\nhands,\n\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that she, didn\'t act in self-defence, and\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that none of the lesser, uh charges apply,\n The uhm, lesser charges, are always, an option\n spend a great\n\ndeal of time, dealing with them,\n But, ah I shouldn\'t say " charges ", ah\n\nthere\'s one lesser charge and that is manslaughter, but there\'s two\n\ndifferent ways, uhm, that ah, the defence particularly sees you\n\nmight reach that result,\n But you only would even, deal with that, if you had rejected\n\n<,> beyond a reasonable doubt self-defence\n\n\nself-defence isn\'t applicable, so that it was shown that the person,\n\ndeliberately  did a  killing  with this  murder, uhm and,\n\nif the person is provoked, or drunk to a certain  \n\n degree  , uhm, then it will, be manslaughter\n Now, I\'m not going to try and explain the degree of intoxication\n\n<,> or the degree of provocation, that would be necessary for the lesser\n\noffences\n I will leave that to your lordship,\n However, in that regard, I will comment upon the other\n word\n\n</unclear> here\n Don\'t uh,\n three or four\n\nwords </unclear>,\n,\n\nlike you people did\n, And, uhm, I have my own misconceptions and, my own\n\ndifficulties hearing and,\n\n\nrely on,  stuff that I may say may  differs from the witness says\n the\n\n uh,  the   one witness, that, was,    obviously a   friend of,  Paddy Warbucks , uhm\n\n<,> that testified right at the start <unclear> three words </unclear>, uh\n\n<,> it was my recollection that she described,  Paddy  the next day\n\n ,  as   being uh, either drunk or stoned\n I don\'t know which one she used,\n this, would uh, uh, be obviously,\n\nsome number of hours, uh we could infer after the actual incident occurred\n\n<,>\n Uh likewise on the issue of drunkenness I would encourage you to\n\nconsider, particularly, her testimony,\n Uh the amount that she, is said to drink,\n Uhm, I suggest it\'s not surprising she doesn\'t know how much she\n\nhad to drink\n it\'s obvious that, she went out, to use the\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> to get  loaded \n it\n\nwasn\'t   just a social type of drinking that one might ah in\n\nsocializing\n I suggest it was apparent from her abuse of prescription drugs,\n\nand alcohol that she wanted, to get high,\n Uhm, and uhm, that this incident happened during that time\n\n<unclear> one or two words </unclear>\n So, as a fallback position and uh certainly not our position as\n\na fallback position, we suggest that drunkenness, would reduce  the\n\n charge of, murder to manslaughter in this case\n Alternatively, or additionally, you could also consider\n\nwhether or not, she was sufficently provoked, by what I    suggest   was, uhm, rather disgusting and\n\ndegrading, things that were said to her,\n disrespectful\n\n  uhm, manner in which she was treated, coupled with the\n\nconstant yelling,\n\n\nthat she received\n Those I suggest, are things you could consider, with respect\n\nto provocation, and <unclear> word </unclear>\n In the event that, you disagree with, our position of\n\nself-defence, then, one of those two alternatives  I have suggested\n\n, as a possibility it\'s up to you, <unclear> word </unclear>,\n\nwhat the result is\n on\n\n  , guilty of manslaughter\n, Now, moving back to what, we, suggest should be the\n\ncrux of the issue in this case and that is, <unclear> seven or eight\n\nwords </unclear>, think about whether or not, this looks like murder to\n\nyou,\n Uhm, if you were, a relatively small woman uh, would you\n\nwant, to, commit a murder where, first of all you, pick someone\n\n<,> that you don\'t know,\n You allow them to take you somewhere that you don\'t know\n You have a witness, along, who you tell personal details\n\nabout the past, that are true,\n\n\n  going to   be someone who can, clearly identify\n\nyou\n so to speak\n\nwhere you live,\n this murder\n\nwith you,\n\n\nto , leave after you  effect  this, murder,\n You don\'t dispose of the body in any way,\n\n\nto have even  planned in advance to dispose of the body,  due to the\n\nprocess , <unclear> word </unclear> belated discovery that there has\n\neven been a killing occur,\n And you\'ve indiscriminately placed your fingerprints all over,\n I suggest nothing adds up, to this being murder\n It is completely illogical\n Rather I suggest, much more inferentially probable that it was\n\nself-defence,\n And that my client, who obviously has a disadvantaged past\n\nobviously was involved in prostitution at the time, obviously has a\n\ncriminal record by her testimony, said oh no\n You know,\n I\'m in an awful situation\n uh tries\n\nto cover things up\n That doesn\'t make it murder but, rather ineffectual and foolish\n\n<,> uhm treatment of the crime scene, ah, if in fact that\'s, what it\n\nis\n Uh that doesn\'t make it a crime,\n The uh,\n\n\nword </unclear> corroborate that it was self-defence\n Besides the, illogicalness of, this killing being murder\n Besides the fact that the rational look at it doesn\'t make sense\n\n<,,>\n, about\n\n<,,>  he\'s got a view  of the scenario  as he leaves , just\n\n<,>\n Not only does he leave as soon as things turn mean\n As soon as my client is struck,\n The very fact that, the picture that he had in his mind when he\n\nfirst heard that there\'d been a death there, was that it would be \n\nPaddy Warbucks  that died, I suggest, that picture was conveyed\n\nfrom him to us, quite deliberately, and <unclear> word </unclear> by\n\n<unclear> two words </unclear>,\n\n\nthat she\'d be the one that was dead if she hadn\'t done what she did, are\n\n<,> completely corroborated by    what Mr\n\n LePieu     said that , he expected  a death \n\ntoo in fact,\n\n\n\n\nbefore he left,\n Further we have,\n Ah certainly there are discrepancies\n says, she was, hit once she says\n\nshe was hit twice\n\n\nLePieu  was there,\n Someone\'s mistaken, uhm,\n perhaps trying to minimize the,\n\npredicament that he left this woman,\n he would ah\n\n,  he allowed   such   uh,  a  \n\nmean and violent thing to be happening\n someone\'s, beating a woman that was obviously\n\nmuch smaller  ,  than   the agressor\n, Uh and then you had uh, the doctors evidence I suggest,\n\nsupports her position that she was struck, a couple of times,\n The uh,\n any event I also suggest that\n\nit was, quite inappropriate for Mr  LePieu , to leave, \n\nPaddy Warbucks , at that house\n He\'d taken her out there, and left her, in quite a\n\npredicament,\n And, I would suggest that, it would be understandable for\n\n   her fear  , to be continually building,\n My learned friend, questioned her quite, thoroughly about\n\n<,> perhaps not, embarking on other methods of trying to escape the\n\nsituation,\n Well, hindsight\'s twenty-twenty\n suggestions that\n\nwere made to  Paddy Warbucks , feasible, practical,\n\nreasonable,\n I suggest it would be reasonable right up until the point that uh\n\n<,> Mr  LePieu  <unclear> rest of utterance </unclear>', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source':

deal with the, criminal record, of the accused\n Only applying to one, witness or one accused and that would be\n\nthe accused,  Matthew \n Now he gave evidence and I think quite properly brought it out on\n\nhis own accord,\n He was asked whether, he\'d ever been convicted of a criminal\n\noffence\n He replied that he had been convicted of, theft, in nineteen\n\nninety and received a fifty dollar fine\n Now I have to give you some instructions as to what use if any that\n\nyou can, make of a criminal record    in a  \n\ntrial\n This criminal record was introduced into evidence, not into\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> only for the purpose of testing the credibility,\n\nor, truthfulness, of the accused, as a witness,\n You may use the evidence of the criminal record when you consider\n\n<,> his credibility\n In order to decide whether a person with a criminal record of this\n\nnature, is the kind of witness  who  might be believed,\n Please remember that a criminal record does not necessarily mean\n\nthat someone is a liar, in the same way that a clean record does not\n\nnecessarily mean that someone is truthful,\n \'s record, you should\n\nconsider, three things\n First you should consider the nature of the offence,\n has\n\ncommitted an offence that involved dishonesty,\n A conviction for an offence that involves dishonesty, obviously\n\nhas more bearing on credibility than a conviction for an offence, that\n\ndoes not involve dishonesty,\n,\n\ncommitted the offence\n A recent conviction may be more relevant to credibility than a\n\nconviction for an offence that was committed a long time ago,\n Third you should consider, the number of convictions,\n A single conviction for a criminal offence is usually less serious\n\n<,> than a long list of convictions\n These three factors should help you to decide whether or not,\n\nyou will believe the accused\'s evidence\n I should tell you however, that I do not think that this one\n\nconviction  where  he received a fifty dollar fine, is \n\nsignificant \n However please remember, that you are the judges of the facts\n\nand you do not have to accept my opinion\n It is important for you to understand that this previous\n\nconviction, is not evidence, of  Matthew  \'s guilt in this trial\n You are not allowed to treat that conviction as evidence that he\n\nis more likely, to commit, the offence with which he\'s charged\n Also you are not allowed to treat his record as evidence that he\n\nis more likely to commit criminal acts in general\n evidence of a criminal record was\n\nadmitted was for a very limited purpose\n It\'s for the purpose of deciding whether or not you can believe\n\nhis testimony\n And again, I\'ve said it once I\'ll say it again I don\'t think in\n\nthis case that his criminal record  that one charge is very  \n\nsignificant , <unclear> word </unclear>,\n Now I\'m now going to continue towards the end of my charge but I\n\nwill now deal with the case against each  of the accused  separately\n wi\n\n   I\'m    going to   have to deal with\n\n  each, accused, separately,\n,\n\n\nthree or four words </unclear> and all the other evidence that was <unclear>\n\nword </unclear>, and particularly the testimony that  Sarah \n\nconsented to the act of intercourse, then you must return a verdict of not\n\nguilty\n\n\nfor the defence that  Sarah  consented, but you are left with a\n\nreasonable doubt, then you must also return a verdict of not guilty\n the\n\ntestimony  according to   Roger  that  Sarah  consented\n\nto have  sex with him  you

    appears to be   a red mark\n\n<,>\n Didn\'t draw blood\n,\n Now, it\'s important to look at these pictures when you assess\n\nwhether or not  Frank Wasylesko  had punched  Raoul Eto  in\n\nthat back hallway or punched anybody throughout   \n\nthe   encounter in the washroom area all the way through to the back\n\nroom\n Firstly, that little scar the one he had before the well-healed\n\none hasn\'t split open  you\'ll recall \n no\n\nother bruises or indications of lacerations or abrasions on any of his\n\nknuckles left or right hand except that little tiny red  nick \n\n\nRaoul Eto  suggests one would think, that there would be open cuts,\n\nor bruises or abrasions on one or more of his knuckles\n Now if he is right-handed\n\n\n Even if he was left-handed uh there\'s nothing to

the evidence, and he suggests that he was\n\nkicked, kicked and punched\n has a pool of blood\n Not splattered on the wall, not splattered on the floor but a\n\npool,\n evidence is that yes there was

else , nothing else which would indicate at all, uhm\n\n   the   fact that there had been this big uh\n\nbeating going on in the back room\n\n\n<unclear> three words </unclear>\n,\n\n, is being\n\nkicked only in the midsection\n Not in the face, not in the upper chest area not in the legs but\n\nin the midsection,\n,\n\n\n<,> that  Charles\'  fresh cut the one that he had recently

had suggested that one of the groups\n\nhad actually  hit his arm ,\n no evidence whatsoever of bruising\n\non  Charles Montebank\'s  arms or back at that particular <unclear> a\n\nfew words

Charles , is only getting kicked, in\n\nthe stomach,\n\n\nCharles  was complaining about a stomach problem and therefore they would\n\n kick on him  in that area,\n suggests,\n\nthat  Charles  was being kicked in that area because ultimately it was\n\nshown that  Charles  had a pancreas problem, and it\'s easy to \n\nsay he was kicked there  but there\'s no evidence of kicking anywhere else\n There\'s no evidence of bruising on the ribs,\n There\'s no evidence of bruising in the upper chest area\n And I already covered that\n\n There\'s evidence of, some marks on his shoulder and I

going on in the\n\nhallway \n\n\n\n<$A> , to prove the guilt of him\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt then you must acquit\n four or\n\nfive words </unclear>,\n,\n\n of   the defence and all the other testimonies <unclear> four or\n\nfive words </unclear>, that the sexual assault I E having anal intercourse\n\nwith  Sarah  did not take place, you must return a verdict of not\n\nguilty,\n of the\n\ndefence <unclear> maybe a word </unclear> sexual assault did not take place\n\nbut you are left in reasonable doubt by it, then you must also return a\n\nverdict of not guilty even if you are only <unclear> two or three words\n\n</unclear>,\n\n\nis  equally  applicable, even if you are not left in a reasonable\n\ndoubt by the evidence in support of the defence that the sexual assault did\n\nnot take place, you must still go on to determine from all the evidence\n\nwhether or not, the accused is guilty\n In other words I again remind you that the Crown must in our legal\n\nsystem prove each and every ingredient of the offence necessary to sustain\n\nthe charge beyond a reasonable doubt\n two or three\n\nwords </unclear> guilty\n As I said earlier the Crown must establish the guilt of the accused\n\n<,> to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt and if the Crown failed to\n\nprove [ 47.00] the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt  then\n\nyou must , acquit\n Now I\'m going to deal with the, last accused and that becomes a\n\nlittle more complicated, because  ,  the case\n\nagainst   Mr,  Childs  <unclear> word </unclear> call him\n\n Matthew , is that he <unclear> word </unclear> or aided the other\n\ntwo accused,\n So I will now tell you about the law of aiding and abetting with\n\nrespect to  Matthew \n\n\nguilty of the offence, because he aided, either  Roger  or \n\nPeter , to commit the offence of sexual assault\n##YES##\n Section twenty-one-two of the Criminal Code states that a person\n\nmay be convicted as a party to an offence, where he or she aids it says\n\n" aids and abets " but " abets " doesn\'t\n\napply in this case, whether or not, he or she aids, someone else to\n\ncommit the offence\n##YES##\n It is up for you\n##YES## to decide whether or not  Matthew  aided or abbetted either\n\n Roger  or  Peter , in the commission of the offence of\n\nsexual assault,\n Therefore it is my duty to explain the law to you so that you can\n\nmake this decision\n First I will read Section Twenty-one-one in the Criminal Code to\n\nyou, and I will explain what it means,\n Second I will list the elements the Crown must prove before you are\n\nallowed to convict,  Matthew  [ 48.30], of being a party to the\n\nsexual assault by aiding,  Roger  or  Peter ,\n Judge reads\n\nfrom Criminal Code for approximately fifteen seconds \n That section is very straightforward,\n It says that a person who actually commits an offence is guilty of\n\nthat offence,\n I\'ll refer to that person who actually commits an offence as the\n\n<,> principal offender,\n Roger\n\n and  Peter  are the principal, offenders, and therefore\n\nSection Twenty-one-one B and C are the paragraphs that deal with, aid\n Essentially they say that someone who aids, a principal\n\noffender to commit an offence is a party to the offence\n Under our law a person who is a party to an offence is just as\n\nguilty, as the principal offender [ 49.30],\n That is really what those sections say,\n That if you aid, the principal offender, and he\'s guilty,\n\nthen that person is also guilty,\n I will now tell you the elements that the Crown must prove before\n\nyou can find  Matthew , guilty of sexual assault\n There are three of them\n The Crown must prove each of these elements beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt\n or,\n\n Peter  committed the offence of sexual assault\n If they\'re both found not guilty then that\'s the end of the case\n\n<,> as far as  uh ,  Matthew  is concerned,\n did\n\naccompany, and this actually aided, either  Roger  or  Peter\n\n to commit the offence of sexual assault\n that uh\n\n,  that uh   he didn\'t do it at all [ 50.30]\n If you accept that or you have a reason to doubt that he didn\'t uh\n\n<,> open this girl\'s legs, then that evidence, alone you would have to\n\n<,> acquit\n#YES#\n if you accept\n\n  his evidence or you have a reasonable, doubt whether he did it\n intended, that\n\nhis act, would aid either  Roger  or  Peter  to commit the\n\noffence of sexual assault,\n The first element, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, and I mentioned that before, is that either  Roger  or\n\n Peter  committed the offence of sexual assault,\n if they haven\'t\n\n  that\'s the end of the case  ,  against\n\n   Matthew  and you have to find him not guilty,\n The second element that the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt is that  Matthew , did something, and that act,\n\nactually\n##NOT Rep/incomplete+complete##, aided either  Roger  or  Peter\n\n, to commit sexual, assault, [ 51.40]\n Now the word " aid " has an ordinary English\n\nmeaning\n That means " to, help ", or "\n\nassist "\n There are a number of ways in which a person can help or assist\n\nanother to commit an offence,\n For example, the aider, can supply the principal offender\n\nwith the instruments needed for committing the offence', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "<$A>  Thank you my lord uh,\n If I may,\n I'll\n\ndo  this first I think\n Uh in response to the Crown, and the Crown's position and if I\n\nmay I'd like to suggest that, if I listen to the Crown's, theory and\n\nthe Crown's position on this quite frankly my lord it is indeed a tale well\n\ntold but a tale nonetheless\n And, there's some fundamental problems that,\n take much of your\n\ntime\n take about fifteen\n\nminutes of the time in responding because    I   made\n\na great number of notes and, I wanted to be sure that I totally understood\n\n<,,> the position of the matter\n I think I do\n\n\ngoing to   overlook all the hyperboles\n and the\n\n<,>  second and  cash related <unclear> word </unclear> aren't\n\nparticularly important to us,\n Which is more that what the evidence has told us\n There's one fatal flaw my lord in the Crown's whole theory and it's\n\nthis\n It's that the Crown says that they're not relying on one overall\n\n progenous  plan in effect\n to my friend very able\n\nsubmission very articulate submission\n progenous\n\n plan\n as follows\n There are, seven or eight, as you will've noticed significant\n\ntime points on the time chronology that Mr  Kent  has forward, for\n\nyou\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  Such as tools for breaking into a house,\n Or they may act as a lookout, ready to warn the others of the\n\napproach,\n Or they may assist the principal offender, by being there,\n\nand helping them,    when   they are committing\n\nthe offence,\n\n\naided, either  Roger  or,  Peter  in the extent of\n\nassistance, helping, facilitating or making it easier for either \n\nRoger  or  Peter , to commit the offence of sexual assault,\n\n\nRoger  or  Peter  even if either  Roger   and  \n\nPeter  could've committed the offence, without, his act\n 's conduct assisted,\n\nfacilitated or made it, easier for the  offence  to be  offended\n\n,\n very briefly\n\ntouch on the evidence which, you must consider <unclear> word </unclear>\n\nwhether or not the Crown has proved that  Matthew  did something,\n\nand that act aided  Roger  or  Peter  to commit the offence of\n\nsexual, assault\n I mentioned earlier\n\nyou have to consider his evidence he denied the count\n or you have a reasonable doubt\n\nthen he has to be acquitted including <unclear> five or six words </unclear>\n\n one of them convicted \n said that the\n\naccused,  Matthew  came into the bedroom, and on one occasion\n\n<,> pulled her legs apart\n\n\n\nMatthew \n he tried to grab, my legs\n\n<,> and pull them apart, but I wouldn't let him \n So you have, slightly different versions, going through all\n\nthat evidence\n 's evidence where he\n\ndenies that that happened,\n aiding, means more\n\nthan just standing by and watching someone commit an offence,\n Mere presence at the scene of an offence is not sufficient to make\n\na person, an aider\n An onlooker is not an aider unless he or she actually encourages\n\n<,> or does something to help, criminal offence\n Therefore in order to prove the second element the Crown must prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that  Matthew , did something and that\n\nact actually aided,  Roger     or  Peter  to commit   the offence of sexual assault\n The third element the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is\n\nthat  Matthew  intended, to aid  Roger  or  Peter  to\n\ncommit  the  offence of sexual, assault,\n\n\n<,> that either,  Roger , or  Peter  personally committed\n\nthe offence of sexual assault,\n is concerned\n\n<,>    first of all,  \n\n  I want to emphasize this that either   Roger  or \n\nPeter , committed, the offence, and that  Matthew \n\nassisted,\n For either, then you must convict, both of them\n They are equally guilty regardless of which one was the actual\n\nperpetrator and which one was the aider or abetter\n emphasize that\n\nif you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, that  Matthew \n\naided either, of these two accused as I have defined it for you then you\n\nmust, find, not, guilty\n Now ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this is a very serious\n\ncharge, and you have very solemn, duties and responsibilities\n\n\nfive or six words </unclear>\n You have taken an oath to try the charge on the evidence without\n\n either  fear or favour, and surrender, a true verdict,\n, you will have performed\n\nyour duties, fully\n Now in closing I want to leave this message with you\n You've heard me say this over and over again and I'll mention it\n\none, last, time\n That every ingredient necessary to sustain the charge against each\n\nof the accused, must be proved by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt,\n With respect to each ingredient every ingredient there's no\n\nobligation on the accused whatsoever\n Now when you go into that jury room, I want you to read them\n\ntogether, and use your good old-fashioned common sense and take whatever\n\ntime you need, to reach your verdict, until you are all each and every\n\none of you satisfied  with it ,\n If you have any questions I want you to put them in writing, and\n\ngive them to the foreperson, that you have chosen\n He's in charge of the jury\n And, that writing will be drawn to my attention\n with which you\n\nneed  help,\n I'll review them with counsel and then I'll call you back\n And I'm quite prepared to deal with the questions and any other\n\nproblems that you may have,\n\n\nfurther instructions, do not hesitate to ask\n Now when you leave I'm going to ask the court counsel here,\n\nwhether I've understated or overstated or simply made a mistake, in\n\nrespect  of  my charge\n And it may well be that I will call you back for further directions\n\n<,> after I  've , canvassed, all court counsellors\n If I do that there may be a danger that you will place too much\n\nemphasis on what I say at that time, than what I just told you    during my   address\n Please don't do that\n Should I recall you you must consider what I say

{'text': "<$A>  <->\n little\n\naccount of what's going on there with Galileo into one of those little one\n\nminute news reports but we've got a little bit more of him explaining,\n\njust what Galileo is and what the scientists hope they're going to get back\n\nfrom it  \n\n<$B>  Galileo is a product of the time that astronomers call the\n\ngolden age of planetary exploration\n Back in the nineteen sixties and seventies when budgets were higher\n\n<,,> a fleet of intelligent sophisticated robots were sent out to survey the\n\nsolar system\n And there were always two\n Viking one and two went to Mars orbited the planet mapped it then\n\nsent landers down on the surface that, tasted the soil looked for life\n\ntook full colour stereo pictures\n Voyager one and two did the grand tour of the solar system visiting\n\nJupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune\n And seeing more than fifty moons along the way\n Many that had never even been seen before\n Galileo was to be the next step\n It was to go to Jupiter and stay there\n Orbit the planet\n Look at it over a long period of time and for the first time,\n\nsample, that, atmosphere\n Send a probe right down into it\n Well with budget cuts and all of the other economic realities that\n\nhit NASA there was only one Galileo\n So the astronomers were forced to put all of their eggs in one\n\nbasket\n And because of that it's been a frustratingly long wait, for\n\nthem\n Right from the beginning, Galileo was delayed\n If it had gone according to its original schedule it would have\n\nalready been over ten years ago\n It was supposed to fly in nineteen eighty-two and it was only\n\nsupposed to take two years to get to Jupiter\n Well delays in the program put it back to nineteen eighty-six\n Then, the Challenger disaster with the space shuttle which blew\n\nup\n That put the program back to nineteen eighty-nine\n By that time they had to find a different way of going to Jupiter\n One that took six years instead of two\n So for some of the astronomers who've been working on this program\n\nthey've been waiting almost eighteen years for this one mission\n And for those who've been waiting for the data from the probe,\n\nall of that wait comes down to just over an hour\n Seventy-five minutes is the only time that that probe is going to\n\nbe sending back data before it's crushed, by that Jupiter atmosphere\n And even after the spacecraft was on its way there had been\n\nproblems that have plagued the poor Galileo spacecraft\n Its main antenna which unfolds like a big umbrella, got caught\n\non a metal strap so it doesn't have the proper shape to be able to send\n\nsignals at the earth\n So they have to use a very slow back up antenna\n And they had to cut down the number of pictures down from fifty\n\nthousand that they were hoping to take, down to maybe three or four\n\nthousand\n At the same time they've had to rely on a tape recorder that,\n\ncan store the data and send it back at this slow rate\n And the tape recorder jammed and almost broke, so now they're\n\nbeing very ginger with that to make sure that it works\n But even though it's had its delays and had its problems and it's\n\nhad frustrations and everyone is biting their nails as it finally gets to\n\nJupiter, Galileo has done some remarkable things\n While it was on its way to Jupiter it took the very first movie,\n\nof, the earth turning\n Which is a rather remarkable thing when you think about it\n We'd never seen the Earth turn\n We'd seen it from space but never actually moving\n Galileo did that\n It also saw the first, asteroids\n We'd known they had been out there\n We've never seen them close up\n It passed two of them on the way here and even found a little tiny\n\nmoon going around an asteroid\n A total surprise to everyone\n And while the amount of data Galileo brings back might be limited\n\n<,> it's still exciting because we've never been inside Jupiter\n For me I've been there throughout this entire exploration of the\n\nsolar system\n\n\ntape cut out  live from the planets and seen worlds that have never been\n\nseen by human eyes\n And you relate to these spacecraft almost like pets\n They're out there in this very hostile environment\n They have a hard time\n You hope they survive and you kind of encourage them on\n Come on Galileo you can make it you can do it you can go there\n So I wish Galileo well, and hope it succeeds in its mission\n\n<$A>  host of Quirks and Quarks our\n\nNational Science Program here on    C B C Radio\n\n \n That can be heard every Saturday right after the noon news weather\n\nand sports uhh right after well it's nine minutes a nice package of\n\ninformation there and then Quirks and Quarks comes on with  Doug Mackenzie\n\n here on C B C nine forty in Montreal \n\n\n Ah Canadiens are playing in Pittsburgh tonight so the test\n\ncontinues for them\n And we keep saying that and it would have been a test for Mario\n\nTremblay anyway with Patrick Roy in the line up had they gotten along\n\nfamously\n Fact is they're not\n They're facing Mario Lemieux tonight, in Pittsburgh\n Should be a very tough game for Montreal\n Patrick Roy will probably get the start for the Avalanche tonight\n They are at home, against the Edmonton Oilers\n And the Avalanche play very well at home\n They've only lost once there all season long\n Among the eight games in the N H L tonight\n One in Quebec major junior hockey\n Sherbrooke is at Drummondville\n And for boxing the Canadian Amateur Championships get under way\n\ntoday in Brampton Ontario\n Ninety men and fifteen women will try and qualify for the Team\n\nCanada that goes to the nineteen ninety-six Atlanta Olympics\n And Canada's top sprinters have agreed to run in the Hamilton\n\nIndoor Games next month\n That includes Montreal's Bruny Surin\n That starts January twelfth\n The meet uh in Montreal will be uh on the nineteenth of January\n\n\n\n\n Well it's supposed to be the end of the rush hour but it doesn't\n\nlook that way from the uhh problems that we have\n Décarie southbound a stall in the lefthand lane at\n\nJean-Talon\n Metropolitan westbound a couple of stalled vehicles there as well\n Left hand lane just before Décarie Circle\n And another one also left lane just before Veuillot\n and the Met westbound is pretty much bumper to bumper all the way\n\nfrom the Anjou interchange to Décarie Circle\n Highway Twenty westbound that accident was cleared away and it is\n\nuhh working much better than it was before so you should have less trouble\n\ngetting out to the airport\n Uh the Mercier bridge we have an accident just reported on the span\n\nthere\n So uh not uh not a good end to the rush hour\n The Champlain though has cleared out fairly nicely\n Cost you about ten minutes there\n Same thing for the Victoria\n Though coming off the Victoria bridge you will find things slow if\n\nyou decide to, get on the Bonaventure because we have the uh Sun Youth\n\ndoing a collection of donations along with the M U C Police at the corner of\n\nSaint-Antoine and University\n And that is backing things on to the Bonaventure\n And one last look at Thirteen southbound and yes they did arrest a\n\nmotorist there for driving with a dummy in the passanger seat\n And you would think thousands of people would get arrested if that\n\nwere the case and they did it everyday\n But you're not supposed to do that in the reserved lane on the\n\nThirteen southbound\n You have to have a real person in the passenger seat and you have\n\nto be at least two people in your car \n\n\n It's three minutes now before nine and ah once again forecast high\n\ntoday probably, minus two\n Should see quite a bit of sunshine in the course of the day\n\n\nget cold down to minus fifteen\n Lots of sunshine for tomorrow but cool temperatures\n Minus eight the forecast high for tomorrow\n Some snow on the way for Saturday\n Not clear yet how much, at this point\n It looks like not very much\n That could change\n Keep listening\n And for Sunday, a mixture of sun and cloud with a high around\n\nminus three\n Let's listen to a little more of Danielle Martineau in a style\n\nwe'd be maybe more expecting from her \n You're listening to Daybreak on C B C nine forty in Montreal\n\n Thanks for joining us this morning\n Cool out there\n Minus seven\n The skies, are quite clear though\n At least\n Throughout the day we'll be expecting a mixture of sun and cloud\n\nthis Thursday the seventh of December \n Skies clearing out overnight, tonight completely\n Temperatures dropping down as low as minus fifteen\n We're ah heading towards a cold and sunny day tomorrow\n Sunshine with a high of only minus eight\n\n\n to minus two for midtown Montreal\n Uh but generally minus five that kind of thing\n So it's not going to be a great great day\n Uhh for the weekend and of course the weekend is in the forecast\n\nat this point we're talking about a little bit of snow for Saturday\n At this point they're saying at least five centimeters\n how the\n\nsystem develops\n But we should see a bit of sunshine on Sunday\n Variable cloudiness for Sunday\n Uhh highs around minus three minus four for the weekend\n Fourteen minutes now after seven\n\n\n\n Two major events there right now\n Uh first of all I'm presently at the intersection of ah University\n\nand ah Saint-Antoine\n Montreal city police\n\n uh are ah doing       \n\nle      special collect to the benefit of ah Sun\n\nYouth ah\n They were here ah trying to ah collect ah with all their,\n\nflashers\n Trying to be ah very ah visible\n unfortunate\n\naccident happen \n A pedestrian was hit ah by a car\n The ambulance right in front of me\n And they're about to ah clear up the sector\n that\n\n  operation uhh here\n So if you're in the Bonaventure expressway beware of some ah delay\n But within minutes uh they should clear the sector\n Secondly, on the Highway Thirteen, real bad start this\n\nmorning\n We have now a second accident\n Thirteen south just before the Highway Four Forty\n Metro\n\ndetachment in conjunction with uh Saint-Eustace are blitzing\n So beware of a ticket operation uh they're not changing their plan\n\nas of right now\n And on Highway Thirteen ah once again it's a real bad start and\n\nit's going to be a real bad day \n\n\n We heard last hour incidently for those of you who may be facing\n\nuhh Thirteen this morning that ah the Ministry of Transport is on the scene\n\n evaluating  they say\n They are going to be reviewing their decision to have that\n\nreserved lane, on the Thirteen\n Uh as soon as they gather some data today\n Could have a decision by the end of the week\n A spokesperson from the Ministry of Transport told us this morning\n\nthat ah they might roll back that decision to have that reserve lane\n So I guess we'll have to wait til the end of the week on that one\n Fifteen minutes now after seven\n\n\nwill be joining us this morning", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'adf6ccba-472b-424d-a0cb-1a24ceb3a40c', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:50.885206+00:00',

six of its\n\nplayoff round against the Rangers, and team owners say, they've\n\ndecided the climate just isn't right to keep the team in Quebec City \n Today in the National Assembly Premier Parizeau tabled the offer his\n\ngovernment made to keep the team\n The province is willing to cover up to twenty-one million dollars in\n\nteam losses over the next three years\n In the meantime Quebec would study whether the team really needs a\n\nnew twenty-thousand seat coliseum\n that's not enough\n\n\n wants the new hockey rink built right away,\n\nand in that arena, he wants a government-run casino that would dedicate\n\nits earnings to support the team\n That way, he says the Nordiques would be able to guarantee\n\nthey'll stay in Quebec City\n And he says the owners have voted unanimously to go if they don't\n\nget what they want\n The Nordiques could be knocked out of the play-offs tonight, but\n\nthe negotiations with the government are likely to go into overtime\n The team president

really talks    in terms of \n\n the very slimmest opening\n\n\nthe president of the Nordiques and Jacques Parizeau where they would discuss\n\nthis question of the casino\n Now Jacques Parizeau has said no in two ways\n\n\nmatter of the casino is not his alone to decide but it's a government\n\ndecision\n uhm\n\nto be a negotiator in this affair and so he sees no need to meet directly\n\nwith  Marchand  on this sort of question\n\n\ntrain   drain   on that\n says that this offer from the government\n\nwas clearly insufficient\n He reiterated their three demands which is the new arena,

says that would sink the team\n\n   if it   isn't covered\n They would go bankrupt\n And then also the question of long-term financing through something\n\nlike the casino\n says they have gathered seventy-five\n\nthousand signatures on a petition that  they'll  be handed in to the\n\nNational Assembly tomorrow, and he says that's proof enough that those'd\n\nbe the kind of people who'd be

by\n\nwithout debate\n The Opposition's price for ending what has effectively become a\n\nsit-in, is for the government to break the bill down into several smaller\n\nbills, then submit the pieces to

stands at Jarry Tennis Stadium\n He was booed as he entered the court, booed as he left the\n\ncourt, and booed at all times inbetween\n The few fans he had, were drowned out by the loud boo birds\n Rusedski says the hostile crowd didn't affect his game though,\n He just went out and played the best tennis he could, with or\n\nwithout support\n In fact, the booing seemed not to bother him at all\n\n<$E>  hurt\n\n  me at all\n\n\ngonna   going to   get    a  \n\ndifficult reaction\n I kind of expected it so, I was prepared for it\n\n\nhow   many times have you been to a tennis match and,

alive in doubles action\n It was there that he was able to silence one of his harshest\n\ncritics\n Former team mate Sebastien Lareau, is openly critical of\n\nRusdeski's decision to play for Britain, but on the court, Lareau and\n\nhis partner LeBlanc, were just two more players for Rusedski and Wekesa to\n\ndefeat\n They just had to do it without any support from the fans\n\n\n\n<$C>  Heh",

was, alive but had a\n\nvery, weak pulse\n And of course he died, shortly afterwards\n And we have a new picture to look at, in connection with the\n\nmurder of Police Constable  Raymond Gagnon  who as you know was\n\nmurdered, in Senneville recently\n The new picture is a picture of a man robbing a bank of Montreal\n There\'s now some reason to believe that he escaped, in a car\n\nthat may, have been the same car, that was the car that  Raymond\n\nGagnon  stopped in Senneville when he was shot, and killed\n So, that, picture is now being published and police are\n\nasking, all of our

{'text': "<$A>  It is a history however that has to be told\n The government takes this issue very seriously and is looking into\n\nhow best to set the record straight and to symbolize our recognition of this\n\nsad event, this very sad event in our history\n Madame Speaker in more recent times the government of Canada has\n\nacted to protect its citizens from this kind of treatment,\n The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees equal\n\nprotection, and benefit of the law without discrimination\n Through the Canadian Multiculturalism Act the parliament of Canada\n\nhas recognized that our society is fundamentally multicultural, in nature\n\nand has committed itself to the full and equitable participation of\n\nindividuals and communities of all origins in shaping Canada's future\n Act as an\n\nexample, Madame Speaker has been repealed by this government,\n Encouraged to immigrate to Canada by Canadian governments Ukrainians\n\nwere a vital part of the settlement process of Canada, particularly in the\n\nprairies\n in the\n\nprairies Madame Speaker, wanted no more than the chance to live and work\n\nin the indignity    in this country of Canada\n\n \n The Ukrainians were among the founding settlers of Canada especially\n\nimportant in settling the prairies\n Between eighteen ninety-one and nineteen fourteen one hundred and\n\nseventy thousand    Ukrainians  , one\n\nhundred and seventy thousand came to Canada\n And between the wars another sixty-eight thousand Ukrainians came\n\nto Canada\n U\n\n   Ukrainians   immigrated to Canada\n Ukrainians did settle however in small numbers in Canada long\n\nbefore the mass    or immigration   that took\n\nplace in eighteen ninety-one\n According to the publication the Canadian Family Tree there were\n\nsoldiers of Ukrainian origin in the De Meuron and De Wattville regiments\n\nwhich fought for Canada in the War of Eighteen Twelve\n in this, in this time period\n\n  before this time period   actually during the period    of   Lord Selkirk in Manitoba,\n There're also Ukrainians who settled in Manitoba coming from the\n\nUnited States prior to eighteen ninety-one\n Madame Speaker in the beginning the Ukrainians faced a very\n\ndifficult life in the prairies as they broke into this land and broke the\n\nland itself\n In spite of this harsh existence community cultural and social life\n\ngrew with a variety of organizations\n Womens' groups newspapers and periodicals architecture, folk\n\narts and poetry developed, over the years\n In nineteen oh five the Ukrainian Mutual Benefit Association was\n\nfounded, in affiliation with the Saint Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Church\n\nin Winnipeg\n Among these Ukrainian workers and farmers there emerged a credit\n\nunion movement which began in nineteen thirty-nine when the New Community\n\nSavings and Credit Union was founded in Saskatoon\n And by the end of the nineteen sixties over sixty Ukrainian credit\n\nunions served an estimated membership of fifty thousand people\n\n\ncitizens   citizens   had become an urban people\n According to the nineteen eighty-one census there were,\n\nsixty-three thousand Ukrainians in Edmonton, fifty-nine thousand in\n\nWinnipeg, fifty-one thousand in Toronto,\n Other major centres of Ukrainian population are Vancouver,\n\nMontreal Calgary Saskatoon Hamilton, Thunder Bay Regina and the Niagara\n\nPeninsula\n Of the five hundred and twenty-nine thousand six hundred and\n\nfifteen Ukrainians in Canada in nineteen nine uh excuse me Madame Speaker\n\nnineteen eighty-one fifty-nine percent lived in the prairie provinces, and\n\ntwenty-five point three percent lived in Ontario\n Much of the cultural struggle for the Ukrainian-Canadian community\n\n  , has   involved the maintenance of its\n\nlanguage\n In recent years bilingual and even trilingual education with,\n\nFrench, teaching included Madame Speaker has been offered in the publicly\n\nsupported education systems of the prairie provinces,\n Ukrainians are a vital part of the cultural fabric of Canada\n To quote from the Ukrainian Community Development Committee Report\n\nfor the prairie regions published in nineteen eighty-six by the    Ukrainian   - Canadian Committee, the Ukrainian\n\nsituation as an ethno-cultural minority is a very special one, permanently\n\nwoven into the fabric of Canadian society,\n Over one thousand organizations exist within the Ukrainian\n\ncommunity\n The painting of uh William Kurelek, inspired by his experience\n\non the    prairies   have been widely\n\nrecognized and George Ryga is a writer of Ukrainian origin of a national \n\nstature  Madame Speaker\n Ukrainians have long been involved in municipal politics as well\n William Hawrelak in Edmonton and Steven Juba in Winnipeg have been\n\nprominent mayors and the first Ukrainian elected to the provincial\n\nlegislature was Andrew Shandro in nineteen thirteen, in Alberta\n In nineteen twenty-six Michael Luchkovich became the first\n\nUkrainian elected to the House of Commons\n Over two hundred Ukrainian-Canadians have been elected provincially\n Another sixty have been elected to the House of Commons\n In nineteen seventy, Stephen Worobetz became the Lieutenant\n\nGovernor    of Saskatchewan  \n And of course a former honourable member of this House His\n\nExcellency Ray Hnatyshyn now serves the country as Governor General,\n And Madame Speaker during the Second World War approximately forty\n\nthousand Ukrainian-Canadians served in the Canadian Armed Forces,\n Ukrainian-Canadians form a vital part of Canadian life\n They are important exponents of recognition of the multicultural\n\nnature of Canada\n of\n\n  of   Ukrainians that took place during the First World War\n We must ensure that present, and future generations of Canadians\n\nunderstand the reality of Canadian history, including events such as\n\nUkrainian internment\n or\n\n  or   even,\n They are even unaware Madame Speaker that they took place\n They are seldom mentioned in the official history books, or in\n\nmuseum exhibits, or in popular press reports about historical events\n Madame Speaker I'm grateful to the honourable member for, this\n\nmotion and for the occasion to speak about the Ukrainian internment\n More important Madame Speaker I'm grateful for those members of the\n\nUkrainian-Canadian community for increasing public awareness about this\n\nhistory\n Without this knowledge of history we risk repeating the same kinds\n\nof mistakes, whenever world crises break out, or stoke the embers of\n\nfear and intolerance\n In one of the most important conclusions of the Spicer Committee\n\n<,> Report last summer was that Canadians need a greater knowledge of their\n\nhistory and of themselves and of each other\n\n\n  we must   encourage the recounting and\n\nthe hearing of our histories\n Thank you Madame Speaker\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$B>  Yes\n Thank you uh Madame Speaker\n Uh, I attended a meeting on behalf of the Minister uhh I guess\n\nit would be probably about a year and a half ago at which the Ukrainian\n\nRedress Committee uhh had a press conference and uh basically told their\n\nstory\n And I think it's a story that, is the story of a minority in\n\nCanada that still hurts\n So I think that this motion that uh Mister Milliken has presented\n\nis one that should be given every consideration by the government\n The government is committed to doing something to redress this uh\n\nhistorical wrong committed by    a previous  \n\nuh government of Canada and I think that the suggestions of Mister Milliken\n\nare certainly excellent ones that should be given every consideration so I\n\nwill certainly support the referral, of the motion\n Thank you,\n\n<$C>  Point of order Madame Speaker\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$C>  the honourable member\n\nfor   all honourable members   the    honourable member   for Burlington Edmonton-East\n\nCarleton-Charlotte and Don Valley-North for their kind interventions\n unan\n\n   unanimity   on this point I wonder, if uh rather\n\nthan drop the motion it could be uh carried by unanimous consent,\n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$Z> \n\n\n\n\n<$A>  And you're listening to Radio Noon\n\n It is now three degrees in downtown Montreal\n I'm going to give you the forecast in uh just a moment or so but\n\nfirst I want to tell you what's on the program today\n\n\n  it is   becoming    curiouser and curiouser   about what might\n\nhave happened on referendum night in terms of the voting\n We have been following quite closely the issue of spoiled ballots\n Now there comes allegations that ah some of the votes were switched\n switched\n who's\n\nan investigative reporter at the Gazette\n\n\nallegations\n We're going to find out more from him about what it might mean\n has this story of a signmaker\n It's a woman who makes these wooden signs in her basement\n will have that story for us\n It is Tuesday and we have the Radio Noon Farm Panel\n And on the phone-in today would you buy private, homecare\n\ninsurance\n I've heard time and time again on this program mostly since the uhh\n\nnews of the hospital closures came out in the spring, people calling in\n\nvery afraid of what that might mean\n Because as you know the regional health boards are saying that this\n\nis part of an entire restructuring of healthcare\n That too many people are spending too much time, in hospital\n We don't need so many hospitals\n Close some down have the hospital stay, shortened and have\n\npeople sent home to recover and recuperate\n there's a lot of wisdom in that\n People are a lot more comfortable at home\n Course the big question is, who looks after them, at home\n or\n\n  any sort of treatment probably aren't capable of looking after\n\nthemselves\n Particularly if you're elderly and if you're alone\n There's a lot of fear out there\n Fear fuelled as well by the fact that if you call up the C L S C\n\ntoday,  chances\n\nare they won't be able to send you anyone\n\n\nJohn Peggoty  reporting today\n Uh they are going to be getting considerably more money\n A lot of that is going to go into home care and they say it's going\n\nto improve\n But, we also hear today from Blue Cross, which is a private\n\nhealthcare company, and it says that it is going to step in where it sees\n\na need\n And it is offering private homecare insurance\n seventy dollars more, a year, if you already\n\nhave one of their plans,   seventy dollars more a year  \n\nyou can guarantee that someone will come in to your home and look after you\n\n<,,> if you are sick if you're sent home from the hospital\n A lot of people find that a very attractive offer\n screaming\n\nfoul saying    that will   completely undermine\n\nthem\n It's going to create this two-tiered system where the wealthy,\n\nget uh homecare    and   the poorer don't get\n\nhomecare\n A whole lot of issues\n Our question for you would you buy, private homecare insurance\n That's next hour on the phone-in\n And in fact we're going, to start the discussion just before\n\none o'clock, when I speak to someone from Blue Cross to find out more\n\nabout what it is that they are offering \n\n\n Now if you were sent home early after an operation at the hospital\n\ndo you trust that the C L S C  would be able to send you someone to help you recuperate\n The Blue Cross private health insurance uh company doesn't think\n\nso\n So it has set up a private policy\n It is a private homecare insurance and it has people really\n\nsteamed at the C L S Cs\n Our question next hour, would you buy, private homecare\n\ninsurance \n Now you knew that was coming\n The beauty of it is you don't know quite when\n It's three degrees right now in downtown Montreal\n Storm on the way overnight\n Fifteen centimetres of snow expected\n Seventy kilometre an hour winds\n Uh by tomorrow morning it's supposed to change into ice pellets\n\nand freezing rain and rain by noon tomorrow\n But a really bad night expected tonight in ah the Montreal\n\nChateauguay    and   townships as well as\n\nthe

{'text': "<$A>  Mister Speaker uh, pursuant to standing order thirty-two two\n\nI have the honour to table in both official languages, copies of a\n\ndocument entitled Shaping Canada's Future Together\n applause, 15 seconds, then short\n\nintroduction by extra-corpus speaker \n\n<$A>  Mister Speaker, I, rise to table the government's\n\nproposals, to renew the Canadian federation,\n The proposals entitled Shaping Canada's Future, Together have\n\none simple but nevertheless critical and crucial objective, to build a\n\nstronger and more prosperous Canada where all Canadians can feel at home\n And I believe Mister Speaker, that that is shared by all members\n\nof this House who believe in Canada \n\n<$A>  Every generation of Canadians has had to redefine the terms,\n\nof living together\n Our generation now faces that same challenge,\n If we're wise and we remain true to our traditions, we can\n\ntransform, challenge into opportunity\n Our goal is not only a framework under which all Canadians can feel\n\nat home in this magnificent country, but one that better equips us to\n\nmeet the challenges of the global economy, in the twenty-first century,\n\nand beyond because if we must provide Canadians with a valid constitution,\n\nwe must also, Mister Speaker provide Canadians with a powerful and a\n\ngrowing economy\n And one goes with the other\n And these two challenges have to be met by all members of this\n\nHouse,\n Canada's needs are well-known, aboriginal self-government,\n\ntwo Houses of Parliament that are truly, democratic and progressively,\n\nmore responsive, recognition in principle and practice of the distinctive\n\ncharacter of Quebec, protection for the rights of all Canadians and\n\nparticularly for minorities, a stronger Canadian economic union,\n\nbringing government closer to the people in framing national programs and in\n\ndelivering programs and services to individual Canadians to people,\n\nreducing wasteful overlap, and duplication in government programs\n There isn't a member in this House who hasn't heard directly from\n\n <->    his   and her voters in regard to not\n\nonly the overlap and the waste in government, but the perception that it\n\nis perhaps in some cases even more widespread, than actually meets the eye\n And of course, the government at all levels, not just Ottawa\n\nbut governments at all levels that listen and lead, and one that truly\n\nempowers people in exercising its powers,\n Mister Speaker none of these changes is in any way, contrary to\n\nthe original concept of confederation now a hundred and twenty-five years old\n Rather these changes add up to a renewal, now long overdue if\n\nthe truth be known, of our confederation\n\n to our proposals and we expect\n\nchanges,\n The joint committee, will hold its first meeting tomorrow,\n And Mister Speaker, the first witness before the joint\n\ncommittee will be the Right Honourable Minister for Constitutional Affairs\n\n<,> whose outstanding leadership in developing these proposals I know that\n\nall members from all parties will want to acknowledge with respect and\n\ngratitude \n\n<$A>  Today Mister Speaker I don't intend to go into a detailed\n\nexplanation of all of these proposals\n They will be available to members of the House and of course to the\n\nmedia and eventually to all Canadians,\n Rather I wish simply to outline them so as to convey to the people\n\nof Canada what lies behind the proposals, the spirit that motivates them\n\nthe objectives we have had in mind in developing them,\n In the Canadian constitutional tradition there exists side by side\n\n<,> protection for individual human rights and the    rights of people   rather as members of communities\n The people of Canada cherish these rights as attributes of our\n\ncommon citizenship\n They are defining characteristics of our Canadian identity,\n They capture in, many ways, the essence of what unites us,\n Our proposals therefore seek to enhance both, individual, and\n\ncollective rights\n For example, Mister Speaker we are proposing that the Canadian\n\nCharter of Rights and Freedoms be amended to guarantee property rights among\n\nour basic rights in Canada \n\n<$A>  And we are also proposing, more stringent limitations on\n\nthe so-called not-withstanding clause which enables legislatures to override\n\n<,> many of our basic rights\n Of the various communities whose rights need and deserve protection\n\nthe aboriginal peoples of Canada have in my judgement a very important claim\n\n<,> on our attention and the attention of all members,\n We have made a commitment to them that they will participate in the\n\ncurrent constitutional discussions,\n And we propose to entrench a continuing constitutional process for\n\naboriginal matters\n Consistent with these guarantees of process, the time has come\n\nto break with our recent history in aboriginal constitutional matters which\n\nsadly, has largely been, by any objective criteria, a history of\n\nfailure\n We are proposing to entrench in the constitution of Canada a\n\ngeneral right to aboriginal self-government within the Canadian federation\n\nand subject to the Charter \n\n<$A>  Our proposal would allow governments and aboriginal peoples\n\nten years to agree on the powers to be exercised failing which, they would\n\nbe defined and enforced by the courts\n In other words Mister Speaker the passage of time would work for\n\nand not against the aboriginal peoples of Canada,\n No aboriginal leader I know believes that self-government is by\n\nitself the remedy for the terrible deprivation and alienation that are so\n\nprevalent among so many aboriginal peoples, but none    underestimates   the value of regaining the right to\n\nself-government and the responsibility that goes with it in providing an\n\nopportunity for First Nations renewal,\n That is what they ask, the right to get on with their own lives\n\nas members of aboriginal societies the right to devise their own solutions to\n\nthe terrible problems which, over generations have come to afflict these\n\nsocieties, the right to work out their own place, by themselves, in\n\nCanada's future, the chance of a new lease on life\n And I'm proposing a deadline on negotiation of the powers of\n\naboriginal self-government because Mister Speaker and I want everyone in\n\nCanada to understand this because I believe that we dare not, wait another\n\ngeneration\n This is a matter of human dignity, of justice and fairness\n We can't repair the past but we need not be condemned to relive it\n\neither,\n And so let us all together ensure that the future of the aboriginal\n\npeoples belongs to them, and to their children in fairness and justice and\n\nequality of opportunity for all \n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  applause, 20 seconds\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n<$A>  applause, 15 seconds\n\n\n\n<$A> \n I believe that we all know that the people of Canada, are going\n\nto be looking carefully to see whether, in proposing change and renewal\n\nfor Canada we    parliamentarians   might\n\nseek to exempt ourselves\n Well we cannot and we must not,\n I am sure that we all realize, that in the minds of the people\n\nof Canada, no area of our national life is more in need of improvement\n\nthan the parliament of Canada itself \n\n<$A>  I want to draw your attention to our proposals for reform of\n\nthe House of Commons\n Some may say these proposals, breach long-standing parliamentary\n\ntraditions\n I would argue to the contrary that these proposals are more\n\nfaithful than some of our modern practices have been, to the essence of\n\nparliamentary government, and M P's prerogatives and individual freedoms\n If we pursue proposals along these lines we will have government\n\nmuch more responsive to the elected representatives of the people and we will\n\nhave members of parliament much more responsive to the people who elected\n\nthem in the first place\n We will then be closer to the British system of parliamentary\n\ngovernment as it was originally meant to be\n We will have a more vibrant and a more vital Canadian parliamentary\n\ndemocracy,\n The people of Canada properly demand a renewed House of Commons and\n\na reformed Senate\n I believe Mister Speaker that our Senate proposals are very much in\n\nline with the expectations of people across Canada but I look forward to the\n\nviews of the public and the recommendations of the parliamentary committee\n\n<,>\n The Senate that we are proposing today, would for the first time\n\nbe directly elected by the people of Canada \n\n<$A>  An unelected body exercising legislative powers, equal to\n\nthe House of Commons is simply not compatible with democratic government,\n The Senate should also be much more equitable in its representation\n\nthan is the present chamber\n Equity includes a range of possibilities, from weighted\n\nrepresentation of member states such as in Germany to equal representation of\n\nprovinces as advocated by the Canada West Foundation\n And we propose and effective Senate\n As a general rule in order for a measure to become law, the\n\napproval by both the House of Commons and the reformed Senate should be\n\nnecessary, and the Senate should have to approve key government\n\nappointments that affect the lives of Canadians\n For example under this plan in the future, nominees such as the\n\ngovernor of the Bank of Canada would have to go before a reformed elected\n\nSenate to explain his philosophy and obtain the approval of that body \n\n<$A>  On legislation involving language and culture special voting\n\nrules a double linguistic majority will apply as proposed Mister Speaker,\n\nby the Alberta legislative committee in nineteen eighty-three and the\n\ngovernment of Newfoundland and Labrador in nineteen eighty-nine,\n On matters of particular national importance such as defence and\n\ninternational relations the Senate would only have    a suspensive   veto\n Under our proposals the House and the Senate would have somewhat\n\ndifferent roles and responsibilities but we believe, that good government\n\ndemands that only the House of Commons, be a confidence chamber in order\n\nto prevent the kinds of constitutional instability that parliamentary federal\n\nsystems have known at other times and in other jurisdictions\n The Commons would likely become a chamber in which there was\n\nstricter adherence to the principle of representation by population\n And the Senate in consequence would provide more balanced, and\n\nmore equitable representation among the provinces,\n Both Houses would have real power\n Most important to Canadians the Senate like the House of Commons\n\nwould for the first time be accountable and responsible to the people of\n\nCanada \n\n<$A>  And so I think uh Mister Speaker there wouldn't be

would have democratic\n\nlegitimacy,\n Mister Speaker for some years Canadians have felt an increasing\n\nfrustration with governments at all levels and that's pretty obvious to all\n\nof us,\n

reforms to our economic union\n There are more interprovincial barriers to trade and commerce\n\nwithin Canada today than there are among nations of the European Common\n\nMarket\n These barriers in our internal market weaken the Canadian economy\n\nand impair our ability to compete in the world\n That is why we are proposing that the constitution be amended to\n\nprohibit government barriers to the mobility of people goods capital and\n\nservices anywhere within Canada \n\n<$A>  In law and in fact our economic growth is profoundly affected\n\nby the policies and actions, of both the federal and provincial\n\ngovernments\n Fundamental conflict between federal and, provincial economic\n\npolicies can be absolutely disastrous\n Even working, at cross purposes, can diminish our prosperity\n\n<,,>\n It is absurd that the twelve nations of the European Common Market\n\nare moving towards a state of economic coordination and harmonization\n\nsuperior, in many ways, to the Canadian economic union which has been\n\ntogether for a hundred and twenty-five years\n And so obviously we must do better\n We must equip this country with the means to act decisively, to\n\nensure as best we can, our own prosperity\n And that is why we are proposing to amend, the constitution to\n\nprovide the parliament of Canada with a new power, to make laws for the\n\nefficient functioning

common values and\n\naspirations that unite us, and our national characteristics, and our\n\nidentity, as we wish it to be\n We are a nation with an immense capacity for generosity and\n\ncompromise, a capacity, that has never mattered more than it matters\n\ntoday,\n Parochialism, small-mindedness, mistrust, these are always\n\npresent in any society,\n These lesser attributes have had their day,\n It's now time for the fundamental qualities of generosity and\n\ncompromise, to dominate the process,\n There are in all, twenty-eight proposals that the Government of\n\nCanada is putting forward today for consideration by the joint committee and\n\ndiscussion with the people of Canada\n\n\n<$A>  Mister Speaker, these proposals, which are perfectible\n\nwhich are going to a committee which will begin hearing tomorrow, will\n\nhopefully be examined in an objective and fair-minded manner not by people\n\n   searching   for perfection because\n\nperfection can become the enemy of the good, but for proposals that are\n\ngood for Canada\n No one need lose,\n the\n\ncause   and the hopes and aspirations of Western Canada are advanced\n\n<,> that does not mean that that    advancement\n\n  means a lose for Quebec\n And if French Canadians feel no more secure, as a result of\n\nconstitutional proposals, and feel a greater attachment and a greater\n\nlove for Canada that doesn't mean that the, rights of, Canadians \n\n  in English-speaking Canada   say in\n\nthe Atlantic regions need in any way be diminished\n This can\n Constitutional proposals fairly considered, actively debated\n\n<,,> generously contemplated, can be what they should be, a win-win\n\nsituation for all Canadians \n\n<$A>  And how are they to be considered,\n Well each one of us, across the country each Premier or each,\n\ntaxpayer or each parliamentarian, each of us, will have to establish I\n\nsuppose his or her own, sense of parameters and his or  her own \n\n objective criteria\n But I think that these proposals must also be considered, in\n\nlight of our greatest obligation\n We've got many obligations\n You can enumerate them\n\n\n up\n But our greatest obligation as Canadians and as parliamentarians\n\nsitting here today is to turn Canada over to our children and our\n\ngrandchildren, unsullied and undiminished as a great prosperous united\n\nnation\n\n\napplause, 15 seconds   \n\n<$A>  And to do that will require compromise\n And compromise is not an indication of weakness\n Honourable compromise in Canada has always been seen, as an\n\nindication of strength and maturity\n The wisdom of, knowing, uh that all of us have to find our\n\nown places in the Canadian sunlight, makes me hopeful Mister Speaker that\n\nthis proposal these series of proposals once engaged will give us all the\n\nopportunity to participate in the building of Canada\n Thomas D'Arcy McGee who was a son of Ireland, but who became a\n\nfather of Canada, saw a brilliant future for our country\n I look to the\n\nfuture of my adoptive country with hope though not without anxiety \n\n Mister Speaker, I along with all other members of this House and\n\nall political parties, I too see such a country, a country of women and\n\nmen of your children and mine whose standard of living is the envy of\n\nmillions and whose way of life, is admired around the world\n This country, Canada, the second largest country on Earth is\n\nalso according to the United Nations one of the two best countries in the\n\nworld in which to live and the challenge for us now is to make Canada second\n\nto none \n\n<$A>  The challenge is to build a stronger country for the security\n\nand the prosperity of all Canadians\n Mister Speaker I have said in this House and other occasions that\n\nthe job of nation building did not end, with confederation\n had the father of\n\nconfederation sought   perfection and insisted on perfection there'd\n\nhave been no Canada, in eighteen sixty-seven\n And that was the beginning of nation building but it continues with\n\neach generation and it continues to this day in our minds and in our hearts\n And we want as McGee said a constitution, cherished, in the\n\nhearts of all of its people\n Not part of its people not some of its people not the people who\n\nlive in the west, and the east but English-speaking, Canadians\n\nFrench-speaking Canadians from the north the south the east, all Canadians\n\nare deserving of a constitution that    represents\n\n  them and reflects their hopes and dreams and aspirations for a new\n\nand a better Canada \n\n<$A>  So we have the challenge to keep Canada and today we have the\n\nopportunity to improve it\n Mister Speaker nothing would serve the economic interests of all\n\nCanadians more directly than clear resolution of constitutional challenges\n They've bedevilled this nation for too long\n And I think it would be with a sense of national relief and\n\ngratitude that all Canadians, dealt with a proposal and managed to bring\n\nthis to a successful conclusion\n In that spirit, I invite all Canadians, all political parties\n\nwho believe in one undiminished Canada, to set aside other differences and\n\nto engage in nation building with the full exuberance that this magnificent\n\ncountry deserves\n I suggest Mister Speaker we get on with it, the building of\n\nCanada of the vision of McDonald and Cartier and McGee and the country of our\n\nown dreams a new Canada, for a new century, honoured in the family of\n\nnations as a modern and flexible and caring country, a Canada respected by\n\nits peers a Canada loved by its people a Canada better able to serve its\n\ncitizens with governments and institutions revised and reformed by this\n\nparliament and by all Canadians that will be tied to the very best that\n\nCanada can provide \n\n<$Z> \n\n<$B>  Mister Speaker I rise in this House today, very conscious\n\nof the importance of the issue, before us,\n At a time of significant national debate, each of us must\n\nfulfill our duty to the best of our ability\n At a time when there is cynicism about the role of politicians it\n\nis particularly important that the political process work, the way it\n\nshould\n I want to be very clear Mister Speaker that the role of opposition\n\nis not to give a blank cheque to the government, nor it is our role to\n\noppose simply, for the sake of opposing something\n The role of the opposition is to scrutinize, to ask the right\n\nquestions, to propose improvements, and to seek to correct error,\n The role of the opposition is to speak for those who have no voice\n This is a role that we will fulfill in the months ahead\n I want to say, that our objective is the unity of the country\n\n  , but   this does not mean\n\nthat we will necessarily agree with all of the proposals of the government\n Indeed, our first impression is that the proposals of the\n\ngovernment need a great deal of work\n Over the next few months some of the debate will be about issues of\n\nprinciple, and we will fight for our principle by proposing improvements\n\nbut much of the debate will be about legal  text \n What does one word mean\n What does one phrase mean\n Are these flaws that can be corrected, or improvements that can\n\nbe made\n\n individual governments and the\n\ncourts must rely upon, it must accurately reflect the intention of its\n\nauthors\n Let us resolve not to transform a debate on legal meaning, of\n\nproposals into an emotional debate about rejections and humiliation, and\n\nlet us not transform a debate about values into a lot of empty rhetoric and\n\npolitical posturing\n Clearly it is too early for anyone to state definitively a hard and\n\nfast position on the government papers\n Constitutional language is extremely important\n And some of the government paper lacks legal precision\n In many places, we do not have a specific proposal, just a\n\nlist of options,\n Over the coming weeks and months, with the help of the people of\n\nCanada, we in this party will work to find, the \n In this round we will not tolerate constitutional wording which is\n\nso deliberately ambiguous that it can be used to mean one thing in one part\n\nof Canada and something else in other part of country \n\n<$B>  Ensuring that these proposals are thoroughly debated,\n\nthoroughly reviewed, and where necessary amended, abandoned or enlarged\n\nthat is our duty\n It is a duty we in this party will honour\n We will not compromise on principles,\n\n\n<$B> \n written for all to see\n\nMister Speaker\n The people should never be ignored\n I will hold the Prime Minister to his promise made today before the\n\nentire nation his promise to involve the people of Canada in this new round\n\n\n\n<$B>  This joint parliamentary committee is to report at the end of\n\nFebruary,\n We must use the remaining time to study the proposals, to debate\n\ntheir meaning to consult widely and to listen to the people of Canada\n Mister Speaker, I have spent time talking about the process,\n\nbecause the process is very important,\n Now I will address principle which, are equally important,\n One of Canada's greatest constitutional thinkers the late Professor\n\n<,> Scott F R Scott once wrote that,  If Canadians can agree upon\n\ngreat and lasting principles upon which they wish their society to be built\n\n<,> then they can agree upon the broad outlines of a constitution, to\n\nachieve these ends  end of quote,\n Our principle as Liberal are clear\n One what is proposed must be compatible with the very nature of\n\nCanada, a nation which finds its  raison d'&ecircumflex;tre\n\n in sharing, diversity, and respect for  \n\n the right   of individual\n\n Two the solutions proposed must result in real reform of our\n\npolitical institutions to ensure that the distinct, concern of Canada's\n\nregions are respected,\n Three the solution proposed must recognize the need, to renew\n\nand modernize our economic instrument including, the training and mobility\n\nof our workforce, to create policies that will permit us, to be\n\ncompetitive, in the world of tomorrow,\n Fourth constitutional reform must not weaken, must not weaken\n\nthe right of individual as guaranteed in the Charter of Right and Freedom \n\n<$B>  Fifth, constitutional reform must not weaken, Canadian\n\nduality and official language minorities everywhere in Canada\n, constitutional reform must not weaken Canada's\n\ncultural diversity and, its heritage of tolerance,\n And finally number seven constitutional reform must not weaken the\n\nability of a strong federal government to speak and act for all Canadians \n\n<$B>  Mister Speaker, the Liberal Party of Canada entered this\n\nparty convinced, that the things we call, Canadian values are as\n\nrelevant today as they have been, at any time in our history,\n At a time when Canadian values are under attack, and, when\n\nour country is divided as never before, we believe that Canadians must\n\nremind themselves of the greatness of the Canadian experiment,\n We also believe that Canadians must devote their energies to\n\nfinding new bonds and new endeavours which reflect our collective values\n\n\napplause, 7 seconds \n\n<$B>  More than ever, we must commit ourself to true Canadian\n\nvalues, values like generosity of spirit and collective action\n Values that will permit us to meet the next century, with our\n\nhead held high\n In discussing constitutional reform we must reflect on the great\n\nand lasting principles of our society,\n Constitutional reforms must have one goal Mister Speaker, and\n\nonly one goal\n That is the well-being not of governments, not of politicians\n\n<,> not of bureaucrats but the citizens of Canada \n\n<$B>  Which government holds which powers, only matters in as\n\nmuch as citizens are well-served\n Therefore to serve the citizens of Canada and that is what all of\n\nus have been elected to do to serve them we must understand the values we\n\nshare as Canadians\n After all Canadian citizenship means more than a shared passport\n\n<,>\n It is shared values\n And quite frankly Canadian citizens have a right to a government\n\nthat can speak and act for all Canadians\n As Canadians, we have a

in Montreal, on April twenty-first\n They will guide us in our work over the next few months\n Let me repeat them here in the House of Commons\n First, to propose an inspiring declaration of the nature of\n\nCanada\n This declaration will set out the will of Canadians to live\n\ntogether in a federal state, the principle which  government's at stake\n\n the values we share our commitment to two official languages a\n\nrecognition of our diverse cultural heritage a recognition of the\n\ndistinctiveness of Quebec and a recognition of the role of the aboriginal\n\npeople\n The government

fundamental right and\n\nfreedom found in the Charter\n They want to see those freedoms strengthened\n we will\n\nnot   we will not   accept any constitutional change that \n\n  diminishes   the rights and freedom of\n\nCanadians protected by the Charter\n applause\n\nstops \n Third, strengthening the Canadian economic union,\n In the\n\nCanadian federal state we are   entitled to expect the

improvements,\n Fourth, institutional reform,\n The regions of Canada need to be more involved in decision-making\n\nand policy-making at the national level\n To meet the hopes and dreams of those who live in the west and the\n\nAtlantic a reformed Senate is essential\n It must be a Senate that is elected effective and equitable\n Such a Senate should have the power to examine appointments to\n\nimportant federal institutions and agencies\n It should also protect the rights of minority language groups\n And it should also require a double majority for legislation\n\ntouching upon the French language and culture,\n It appears the federal government has adopted a lot of, this\n\nproposition\n We will listen carefully to the view expressed before the committee\n\n\n<$A> \n Since the creation of the Charter nine years ago the Supreme Court\n\nof Canada is becoming more and more of a constitutional court\n For that reason alone it is reasonable to expect that the

that we\n\nwant to achieve, the goals to keep this country together and give the\n\nCanadians, a new constitution and a new departure for the twenty-first\n\ncentury, but we have to do it in a way that it is acceptable to all the\n\nCanadians\n We have to do it in a sense that, rather than divide us that\n\nwill make us closer to each other, cos we have too much in common to be\n\ncomplacent\n

good, propositions in this House some\n\ngood amendments that if had been accepted by this House then there would have\n\nbeen no crisis but they were all rejected \n\n<$A>  Because they were all

having when we\n\nreceive anybody, coming here\n Like yesterday morning I had the privilege to meet with the\n\npresident of Ukraine, everybody went they look at us they envy us and it\n\nis our

will\n\nparticipate in \n\n<$A>  But there are some people Mister Speaker in all parts of\n\nCanada, who say that it's too late for Canada\n And to them let me cite the words of a first generation immigrant\n\n<,> who said and I repeat,  I came here as a guest  \n\nRahim Balangee  writes  and Canada was generous as it has been to\n\nthe generations of guests it has accepted and accommodated in its short and\n\nglorious history \n\n Well Mister Speaker I can only agree with that person who chose\n\nthis country for many of the values that all of us hold dear because it would\n\nbe a tragedy Mister Speaker because we are a nation like no other populated\n\nby the First Nations a vibrant French-speaking society rich regional cultures\n\npeople who have come from every corner of this globe who make up the reality\n\nof Canada in nineteen ninety-one, and who work together as we move to the\n\ntwenty-first century\n We are a northern nation Mister Speaker of great possibilities\n\nwhere citizens and cultures come together\n I'm here because I believe in this northern nation\n I believe in this possibility\n I believe that though we are far from perfect we offer the world an\n\nexample of tolerance and harmony, and yes we can give to the world some\n\nhope,\n We have a responsibility Mister Speaker to others, to ourselves\n\nto those who follow to fulfill the promise of Canada\n I'm here because I believe we can join together to correct the\n\nflaws address the injustices and create the best Canada we can, a Canada\n\nthat all Canadians will want to belong to\n Let me turn then to the proposals put forward today\n\n are delighted to say\n\n the least  Mister Speaker to see the government is looking at the\n\nabolition of the present non-elected Senate,  the  goal we have\n\nheld for many many years in this party\n One also sees in this document Mister Speaker movement, towards\n\nsomething else my party has long advocated and that is the recognition of the\n\nright of aboriginal people to self-government\n In this document the government does not address the inherent right\n\nto self-government and I would suggest that that must be a major part of the\n\ndiscussion as the committee goes forward \n\n<$A>  And let me say, in this area Mister Speaker that a\n\nfundamental principle must be that aboriginal people must be involved in\n\nevery way at every stage at every step along the way\n The First Nations of Canada must have a prominent place at the\n\nconstitutional table\n Let me say with respect to the division of powers Mister Speaker\n\nthat it will take some time to fully study the government's proposals\n We are talking about some fundamental changes\n The New Democratic Party is not opposed to change, but we feel\n\nin each area there must be a rationale for how that change, will meet the\n\nneeds of Canadian people,\n\n\nculture   for instance, I think Canadians must be able to see how\n\nthese changes, would in fact directly benefit them, because all of\n\nthese changes will have a profound impact on the future of our nation as a\n\nwhole and how Canada will come to be defined in the twenty-first century\n that the New\n\nDemocratic Party believes that a strong Canada requires a strong, national\n\ngovernment\n Any redistribution of powers that takes place must meet one\n\nfundamental test for this party\n It must not be about meeting the demands of government\n It must be judged on the criteria of meeting the needs of citizens\n\n\n\n<$A>  Mister Speaker it's my view that the role of the federal\n\ngovernment must be re-examined\n The government has put out some proposals on this\n\n\naccept the principle as I certainly do as my party certainly does that the\n\ndiversity of Canada is part of our strength that the rights of First Nations\n\nthe distinctiveness of Quebec, the rich culture and contribution of our\n\nmulticulture multi-ethnic communities the equality of men and women all of\n\nwhich are fundamental to who we are as a nation if we are to recognize that\n\ndiversity in a fundamental way we must also recognize in a fundamental way\n\nthat the unity of this country will require a federal government that can\n\nrepresent every Canadian in all parts of the country in the national interest\n\nand the international interest\n That's what the New Democratic Party\n\n<unclear> word </unclear>, \n I repeat Mister Speaker that there are a number of things, that\n\nwe can look favourably upon in initial reading of these proposals but there\n\nare also elements, that are potentially disturbing elements that indicate\n\nthat this government has a very different vision of the future of Canada,\n\na very different vision and of course it is, the Conservative Party vision\n\nof Canada, but it is a vision certainly in some instances that is\n\ncertainly not shared by the New    Democratic \n\n Party nor by many Canadians\n It is of course the government's right to put forward its vision in\n\nterms of its own political philosophy, but if the consultation process if\n\nthe parliamentary committee is to have any meaning, we must seriously\n\nlook at all visions of Canada, and try to come up with a consensus on what\n\nwill best represent all Canadians and not one agenda \n\n<$A>  I want to raise some questions particularly Mister Speaker on\n\nthe proposed economic union\n I believe we can all agree in this House that the reduction of\n\ntrade barriers  at  greater cooperation among provinces and\n\nterritories is an important and a laudable goals, but we must ask, some\n\nhard questions\n Does the kind of domestic free trade in people goods finance and\n\ncapital extend the same  laissez faire  principles of the\n\nCanada U S trade deal to a domestic playing field,\n Will there be winners and losers in this and if so how do we deal\n\nwith that\n Could this potentially lead to a whole new round of privatization\n\nderegulation, diminishing social standards and diminishing corporate taxes\n\n<,,> as we look at this in terms of greater cooperation\n And Mister Speaker we must raise questions about the ability within\n\nCanada, to reach the goals that we wish    to  \n\nreach in this economic cooperation if we in fact do not have a transportation\n\ninfrastructure in place, which is absolutely necessary in a country of\n\nthis  size and which has lamentably has been\n\nsystematically destroyed, \n What does the right of corporations to free movement of goods\n\nservices and capital mean for weaker provinces who seek to establish their\n\nown, economic development programs\n What does it mean for provincial Crown corporations\n What does it mean for provinces or territories trying to support\n\nlocal jobs in fledgling industries\n What does it mean for affirmative action\n What are the implications, of this form of, economic union\n\n<,> in terms of aboriginal self-government agreements\n harmon\n\n   harmonization   but does not mention initiatives to\n\nhave greater regional equality and to strengthening section thirty-six of the\n\nconstitution on regional equality falls far short, in this party's opinion\n\n\n\n<$A>  Economic union proposals that suggest that the only role of\n\nthe Bank of Canada will be to address inflation but not as well to look at\n\nunemployment to look at fiscal and monetary policy as an instrument to\n\naddress unemployment falls far short, Mister Speaker of what we can be and\n\ncan do if we're to have greater cooperation in the economy across this\n\ncountry\n And so I say Mister Speaker that, while we support greater\n\ncooperation while we support looking at a renewal of the relationships\n\nbetween the provinces territories and the federal government in economic\n\nareas we must also not simply take a defensive posture but a posture that\n\nsays in this economy we will reach out we will initiate to seek greater\n\nequality and that that will be a strong commitment of a federal government\n\nany federal government of any political party and a fundamental part of our\n\nconstitution \n\n<$A>  Mister Speaker part of the proposals on the economic union\n\ninclude a Council of the Federation, and there're again many issues I\n\nthink that must be discussed in terms of what that council will do, what\n\nkind of decision-making powers that council will have how those will mesh\n\nwith the decisions of the House of Commons and indeed what implications a\n\nCouncil of Federations has which according to the document instrument make\n\nmany decisions when in fact aboriginal groups will not be included on that\n\nand yet we'll have according to the same document aboriginal self-government\n\nagreements\n So there are questions to be raised Mister Speaker\n We will be doing so in a constructive manner with alternatives,\n And I find that, what is important as we move into this process\n\nat this time is that we are constructive and we do present ah proposals,\n\nand when we raise our vision of Canada and our alternatives it's not simply\n\nto discredit someone else it's because we truly believe that each of us in\n\nthis House each political party has a contribution which will be\n\nfundamentally in the interests of Canada and that if all of those\n\ncontributions can be brought together we will have the kind of consensus on a\n\nconstitution that we must have because as we know the constitution is not\n\nsimply the government's constitution the New Democratic Party's constitution\n\nthe Liberal Party's constitution it is a constitution for the people of\n\nCanada now and in the future \n\n<$A>  Mister Speaker I also find it somewhat disturbing that the\n\nproposals    put   forward today include such\n\nthings as the entrenchment of property rights but make no mention of the need\n\nto entrench social rights",

 uhh private members' business section, uh and\n\nI'm pleased to at least have one come forward even if it's uh for a brief\n\ndebate,\n I had hoped that perhaps at the end of the hour the government\n\nmight allow the motion to pass, uh so that we could uh, possibly see\n\nsome government action    in this   particular\n\narea    which   I know the government is\n\nin fact considering,\n Canadians Mister Speaker\n\nare unaware of the plight of the Ukrainian-Canadians who were interned during\n\nWorld War One,\n In fact uh when the war broke out, the government said that,\n\nCanadian- uh Ukrainians who had immigrated to, Canada from the western\n\nUkrainian territories of Galicia, and    Bukovina   both of which were then part of the\n\nAustro-Hungarian Empire, uh were enemy aliens and they posed a threat to\n\nnational security,\n Mister Speaker uh the government took the view that this threat\n\nrequired that these, particular persons who were in many cases Canadian\n\ncitizens, ought to be interned and held in camps for the duration of the\n\nwar and accordingly about five thousand, Ukrainian-Canadians were in fact\n\ninterned by the federal government in twenty-six camps that were located\n\nacross Canada\n One of those camps happened to be in my riding of Kingston and the\n\nIslands, and was in the famous old fort there Fort Henry uh which was\n\nbuilt sometime    in the middle of the\n\nnineteenth century  \n Approximately eighty-eight thousand others Mister Speaker most of\n\nthem uh Ukrainian-Canadians were forced to report regularly to local police\n\nand to internal, uh security authorities\n This uh in spite of the fact that in many cases these persons posed\n\nabsolutely no risk uh security or otherwise to the Canadian state,\n I'd like to read a quotation from a book written by Lubomyr Luciuk\n\na constituent of mine Mister Speaker who's a professor  \n\n uh at   Queen's University in the Department of Geography\n\n\nand   and   member of the uh committee that is seeking redress\n\nin this case, and he has written a pamphlet called A Time for Atonement uh\n\nsubtitled Canada's First National Internment Operations and the\n\nUkrainian-Canadians Nineteen Fourteen to Nineteen Twenty\n And I'd like to quote from his book, page nineteen\n,\n Again he's quoting\n\n,\n\ninternment   uh went on for a considerable period, uh until\n\nnineteen twenty in fact, but uh the internment was not the only problem\n\nfaced by these, citizens\n In nineteen seventeen uh many members will recall the government at\n\nthe time passed    the Wartime\n\nElections Act   which disenfranchised most Ukrainian-Canadians as\n\nwell as many others\n women\n\nof men    serving     uh uh wives\n\nof men serving   in the Armed Forces\n persons of German origin\n\n  Canadians of German origin   and other uh groups that were\n\ninvolved in the First World War on the other side\n It was not, an election act of which Canadians can be proud\n In fact uh frankly it was a national disgrace\n Uh the government rigged the elections very much in its favour so\n\nthat it could win uh the nineteen seventeen election campaign uhm uh which\n\nsaw the    Union   government as it then was\n\nrun and win the election in that year,\n They paid for it in due course as a historical footnote because of\n\ncourse in nineteen twenty-one uh they were thrown out and replaced with a\n\nvery sound administration under, the very distinguished and capable\n\nWilliam Lyon MacKenzie King,\n In nineteen eighteen an already censored uh Ukrainian language\n\npress was closed down\n Uh and this obviously right near the end of the war\n During the war Ukrainian-Canadians were often maligned in regional\n\nand national newspapers\n They were forced to work as poorly paid labourers in remote areas\n\nand were often relocated away from their homes and their families,\n property\n\n  confiscated as I've already indicated\n Some committed suicide while they were imprisoned\n And some were killed in unsuccessful escape attempts\n uh of the\n\n  Ukrainian-Canadians were still interned and the government changed\n\ntheir status from that of enemy alien to Bolshevik and kept them locked up\n\n<,> for fear that they might be sympathetic with the new, communist regime\n\nin the Soviet Union\n And not until nineteen twenty were the camps, finally closed\n\ndown\n\n\nthat    that the   Ukrainian-Canadians posed a\n\nthreat to national security and indeed the government never produced any\n\nevidence to that effect at all\n Indeed in January nineteen fifteen the British Foreign Office\n\ninformed the federal government that Ukrainian-Canadians should be treated as\n\n<,> friendly aliens\n The government was told that many Ukrainians like other\n\nnationalities within the Austro-Hungarian Empire were opposed to\n\nAustro-Hungarian rule and would not therefore be sympathetic    with   Canada's enemy, in the war\n The motion that I have put before the House, is one that is\n\nsupported, by the Ukrainian Canadian Committee\n That committee wishes the government to formally acknowledge the\n\nunjust and unwarranted treatment that these persons received during the First\n\nWorld War\n They would like to have the event commemorated by having historical\n\nmarkers established at the various internment sites including at Fort Henry\n\nin Kingston which was the first site used as an internment camp\n I should also note as an historical footnote that the same fort was\n\nused during World War Two, to house prisoners of war, and indeed the\n\nInternational Red Cross uh made statements concerning its use    as a   prisoner of war camp that it was not a suitable place\n\nto house prisoners so one can only imagine uh what the condition was uh\n\nduring the First World War when no international organization apparently was\n\ninvolved in checking on the internees\n The Ukrainian Canadian Committee has asked the firm of Price\n\nWaterhouse to compile a study on the financial losses of the internees\n The report is due later this autumn and once it is complete the\n\ncommittee would like to discuss the matter of redress with the government,\n,\n\nCanadians   who were interned during World War Two has clearly\n\nestablished some kind of precedent\n\n\nma    many    , number   of years that\n\nhave elapsed since this internment took place very few if any of the\n\ninternees must still be alive, and accordingly the committee is not\n\nseeking a redress on an individual basis but rather in the establishment of a\n\ntrust, uh fund for the Ukrainian community in Canada which could be used\n\nfor various purposes of that community,\n Speaker the purpose\n\nof the motion that I have put before the House, is to urge the government\n\nto look at the facts look at the record and see if something cannot be done\n\nthat would in some way, commemorate, the evil that was perpetrated by\n\nour country on these people at that time\n These were innocent citizens of our country who were never\n\nconvicted of any crime, who just happened to come from an area with which\n\nCanada was at war\n Because of that, they were deemed uh, unsuitable to, carry\n\non their daily lives on their farms and their homes wherever they happened to\n\nlive in Canada were rounded up and herded into these camps,\n They were separated from their friends from their families from\n\ntheir communities and held far longer than was necessary solely uh because\n\nthe government perceived there may be a security risk to our country because\n\nof the fact they came from that particular part of Europe\n With great respect uh, it is clearly a situation that calls for\n\nsome kind of relief\n Uh I'm not suggesting as I indicated earlier that payments be made\n\nto individuals and neither is the Ukrainian Canadian Committee\n The committee seeks redress for the community and seeks to have the\n\nfact of this internment commemorated in plaques at the various locations\n\nacross Canada where these internments took place\n In closing perhaps I could quote uh my uh friend Mister Luciuk and\n\nBohdan Kordan both members of the Ukrainian Canadian community, uh when\n\nthey published an article in the Kingston Whig-Standard \n The uh article I think uhh summarized at least the views of their\n\ncommunity and they wrote as follows\n\n Madame Speaker I know that the government is sympathetic to the\n\nplight of these people uh or to the plight that they suffered    in any   event these many years ago\n I know that the government is considering moving on this issue\n I urge them to take the matter in hand, handle it with dispatch\n\n<,> and seek to come to an arrangement that is satisfactory, to ensure\n\nthat the fact that this type of thing went on in our country is not forgotten\n\nbut is indeed commemorated, uh perhaps as a sad reminder of how sometimes\n\nwe fall off our notions of fairness and equity and justice which we so often\n\ntake for granted in Canada today", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source':

{'text': "<$A>  Madame Speaker\n Let me uh at the outset uh commend the honourable member for\n\nbringing uh his motion forward\n timely and uhm, I'm\n\npleased to be able    to address   the\n\nmotion and acknowledge the treatment of Ukrainian-Canadians at the hands of\n\n<,> past governments\n We all agree that uh mistreatment of Canadians because of their\n\norigin is unacceptable\n Unfortunatelty Madame Speaker the history of our country has not\n\nalways reflected, the principles of justice and equality that make us\n\nproud Canadians today\n Thankfully this sad chapter in our history is now behind us,\n\n\n however   these events, must be brought out into the open\n This Mister Speaker concerns each of us\n\n\n of   situations like this one and that it is important to set the\n\nrecord straight\n Madame Speaker our government today is commited to building a\n\nstrong multicultural society, one that abides by the rules of justice\n\nhuman rights and mutual respect\n The basis of this uh commitment is clear understanding of how\n\nCanada came to be\n and\n\n  to face up to our past\n\n\ncommitted himself to a formal apology regarding the matter of\n\nUkrainian-Canadians interned during the First World War\n We must not forget that Ukrainian-Canadians helped build this\n\ncountry\n We must not forget that the history of Ukrainian-Canadians is\n\nclosely interwoven with the growth and the achievements of the prairies\n Their contribution to Canadian life which began, in the eighteen\n\nhundreds continues today\n As Canada's fifth largest ethno-cultural group the\n\nUkrainian-Canadian community is present in every sphere of activity cultural\n\nprofessional educational political religious and financial\n With a network of over a thousand organizations and a highly\n\norganized structure the community has a voice in over a hundred and fifty\n\ntowns and cities across this country\n Ukrainian-Canadians have come a long way\n Ninety percent of the community is Canadian, - born and\n\ntherefore fully integrated into the mainstream of Canadian culture\n Nonetheless Madame Speaker uh Ukrainian-Canadians are strongly\n\nattached to their heritage and therefore determined to maintain their culture\n\ntheir language and their identity\n Ukrainian-Canadians are a perfect example of the country, we are\n\nstriving to build\n They are full-fledged Canadians with Ukrainian heritage that gives\n\nthem a unique flavour\n\n\n personify   I should say    our  \n\nmulticultural society\n\n\nand   cultural heritage the    Ukrainian \n\n community has long since been the most outspoken advocates for a\n\nmulticultural nation, one that recognizes that diversity    uh is a fundamental   characteristic of\n\nour country and a vital part of being Canadian\n Ukrainian\n\ncommunity produced an in depth study, entitled Building the Future\n\nUkrainian-Canadians in the Twenty-First Century\n As the title suggests the document is proof that\n\nUkrainian-Canadians are turned, towards the future\n They are men and women of action\n The document established a strategic process of renewal and\n\ncoordination within the Ukrainian community in Canada\n It set specific goals in education arts communication cultural\n\ndevelopment as well as public policies and programs\n\n\nmulticulturalism   was the key to maintaining their culture while,\n\nparticipating fully in the larger Canadian society\n Ukrainian-Canadians promote the concept of, functional,\n\ntrilingualism, and many of them exemplify this goal by being fluent in\n\nEnglish, French and Ukrainian\n\n\ncan identify  or  can definitely pride  themselves \n\n in being amongst the architects of the Canadian Multiculturalism Act\n\npassed in nineteen eighty-eight\n Because they refused assimilation, Ukrainian-Canadians have met\n\nchallenges of integration while retaining their essential qualities of their\n\nheritage\n Today our country is proud of the numerous Ukrainian, - Canadian\n\npersonalities who contribute to the innumerable facets of Canadian life\n A life at Rideau Hall, with Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn\n Life in the Supreme Court with John Sopinka\n\n\nhockey players    like   Dale Hawerchuk and Mike\n\nBossy\n to name uh a\n\nfew among the many\n These people and thousands more, Madame Speaker confirm the\n\nenormous contribution of Ukrainian-Canadians to the economic and social\n\ndevelopment of this land\n, Ukrainian-Canadian\n\ncommunity   I should say has come a long way\n Despite difficulties Ukrainian-Canadians have done well\n vital\n\ncommunity and one that continues to prosper\n This year, Ukrainian-Canadians are celebrating the proud\n\ncentenary of the Ukrainian settlement in Canada\n The official opening which was held at the end of August marked the\n\nbeginning of festivities that will unfold throughout the country during the\n\nnext twelve months\n The official closing of this centennial celebration in October,\n\nnineteen ninety-two will coincide with the triennial congress of\n\nUkrainian-Canadians\n Many special events are planned by individuals and organizations on\n\nnational regional provincial and local levels,\n for\n\n   for this   Ukrainian-Canadians   to\n\ncommemorate and honour their rich historical past salute their present and\n\ncreate a vision, for the future\n this\n\nweek's, proposal for constitutional reform, it is true that this\n\ncountry,    and its   creation has not taken\n\nplace without pain and suffering\n The aboriginal people, uh in particular have paid a high price\n\nfor other people's search for freedom\n Canada has not always been inclusive and many have been left out of\n\nthe benefits of citizenship\n are now, uh only now\n\nacknowledging   uh we are    only now  \n\nacknowledging   and trying to remedy Canada remains deeply symbolic\n\nof freedom in its broadest sense\n Many around the world still long to come to our shores to share in\n\nwhat we have built\n People in other nations continue to risk their lives and sacrifice\n\ntheir security, for freedoms that    previous\n\n  generations have already guaranteed for us in this country\n What better time Madame Speaker for all Canadians to recognize the\n\ncontribution of this vibrant community one which has undergone tremendous\n\nchange over the past hundred of years but one that retains values traditions\n\n<,> and a language and all fundamentals of our Canadian way of life\n Thank you very much,\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$B>  Thank you very much Mister Speaker,\n Excuse me Madame Speaker,\n Uhh, I too would like to thank and congratulate the honourable\n\nmember from Kingston for uh, bringing this matter to the House today\n It is a matter that uh, has cried out for effective treatment\n\nfor a long time,\n I'd like to start Madame Speaker by asking yourself and through you\n\nthe other members present here today to uh conjure up a picture,    in   your mind,\n Highway One\n\nA    the   road that uh was there before the\n\nTrans-Canada Highway One was built, northwest of Banff  \n\n in the   Bow River Valley within the Canadian Rockies about\n\nhalfway up Highway One A, between Banff and Lake Louise, at a junction\n\n<,,> in front of the towering Castle Mountain which is a wall of rock,\n\nthat stretches, literally for miles, rising up on the east side of the\n\nBow River Valley,\n Place yourself there in your mind, on the road in the flatlands\n\nof the valley in the winter\n Few people stop, along, this road especially in the winter\n\n<,>\n The scenery is stupendous,\n The towering mountains are brilliant, in their fresh coat of\n\nsnow\n with every gentle wisp, of\n\nbreeze, the pine trees drop a cascade of snow  \n\n in a   sparkling dazzle of crystals, and colour\n Occasionally a car swishes by, speeding towards Banff, to\n\nthe south or Lake Louise and other points to the north,\n And Madame Speaker if while standing there you close your eyes and\n\nstand stock still and again use your imagination you can see another scene\n\n<,> a shockingly disturbing scene,\n Right there, and not very long ago, for between nineteen\n\nfourteen and nineteen twenty in one of the most, shameful episodes of\n\nCanadian history, thousands of recent immigrants to Canada were imprisoned\n\nthere\n The concentration camp near Castle Mountain outside Banff was only\n\none, of the twenty-six such internment camps scattered across the country\n\n<,>\n Thousands of Ukrainians and other people of East European descent\n\n<,> were designated enemy aliens, stripped of their property, and\n\ndenied their civil rights\n Over eighty thousand people mostly of Ukrainian origin, were\n\nforced to carry identification papers and report to local police,\n Over eight thousand others were separated from their families,\n\nconfined behind barbed wire, and forced into hard labour\n And what was the crime that justified this imprisonment, this\n\nmassive injustice perpetrated, under the provisions of the recently passed\n\nWar Measures Act,\n Madame Speaker there wasn't one,\n These Ukrainians were simply recent immigrants, who happened to\n\nhold, Austrian passports\n Many simply didn't have a job,\n These were not enemies of Canada\n In fact the British government expressly informed the Canadian\n\ngovernment that these Ukrainians should be considered friendly,\n In fact many of them had fled their homes to avoid being\n\nconscripted into the Austro-Hungarian army\n But even though they had committed no crime, these new Canadians\n\nwere forced to build the internment camps that contained them, to build\n\nthe roads including the predecessor to that Highway One A, to clear the\n\nland to cut wood, and work on railway construction projects\n Later, they were forced to work at miserable pay for private\n\ncompanies,\n\n\n<,,> these sites   that used to be internment camps every year,\n\nyet few Canadians know the extent of the hardship that was caused in Canada\n\nto our own,\n Canada should finally acknowledge that this gross injustice\n\noccurred here\n We can never right the wrongs that were committed, but we can\n\nteach our children what happened, why it happened, in the hope that\n\nthey may learn from the past so that such injustice may not happen again\n For this reason Madame Speaker I and, the New Democratic Caucus\n\nand Party of which I am a member very strongly support several steps\n First, an official acknowledgement by the government of the\n\nserious injustices that were inflicted on these Ukrainian-Canadians\n Second, the placement of historical plaques at appropriate sites\n\nnear, those twenty-six internment camps\n Third the establishment of a national redress commission to review\n\nrequests for redress of discriminatory acts of past Canadian governments and\n\nrecommend appropriate and expeditious action to deal with this, and other\n\ndark episodes in our history\n In addition Madame Speaker we support, the partial\n\nreconstruction of that Castle Mountain Camp in Alberta as an educational site\n\nto which Canadians could go, and other visitors, could go, be\n\nencouraged to pause along their drive through the majestic Rockies, to\n\nreflect on what they themselves might do to ensure that such a \n\nsorry event never occurs in Canada again and Madame Speaker perhaps as well\n\nto reflect, on what it is, that human societies, can do to\n\nthemselves, when, the idea of the enemy, the other, the apart,\n\nthe separate, becomes, a more compelling idea, than the certain\n\nknowledge, that we are all of us, brothers and sisters\n Madame Speaker, this is a motion, completely worthy, of\n\nthe non-partisan support of all elements in this House\n I greatly hope it receives that support\n Thank you,\n\n<$Z> ,\n\n<$C>  Thank you Madame Speaker\n I'm honoured Madame Speaker to speak in response to the motion by\n\nthe honourable member and specially in light of the importance of the issues\n\n<,> being uh raised Madame Speaker,\n Canada today is a vibrant and tolerant society that recognizes the\n\nessential nature of its multicultural reality\n Ukrainian-Canadians have been major exponents of the recognition\n\nof the multicultural nature of Canada\n Canadians can trace their origins to every part of the world\n People from all over the world have played a major part in\n\nsettling the land developing our resources building cities, and forging\n\ntransportation links over vast distances\n Madame Speaker the internment of Ukrainian-Canadians during the\n\nFirst World War is not a proud moment in our history", 'subdomain':

established that she couldn't even have been three years old\n\nat that time\n That's when he stumbled across, the, fact,\n started the idea of the\n\nbicameral brain,\n And it gives new importance to the caves of the subconscious where\n\neach human has stored, a unique and individual, past,\n And we know that, thanks to Wilder Penfield that nothing which\n\nbombards a human brain is ever lost\n It may be forgotten but it's not\n Now, that's the resource,\n That's the unrefined resource\n It's called life,\n It's, smells sights sounds touches, bits of people,\n\nemotions, and you've got to prospect, that, stored  ,  resource  \n So I'm not too far, off, the thing here, because the\n\nimportant thing about that art resource for a, writer, of short stories\n\nplays poems novels, there's an important geographic dimension, to it\n And that dimension has its effect during the litmus years of\n\nchildhood when somebody is stained\n So boy if you're north of the forty-ninth parallel, and I'm not\n\nfar north during those, affecting years for me, when I built up my\n\nresources out of which I might, refine, uh I'm not a practicing poet\n\nbut plays novels short stories\n Now, as a child, for the first twelve years I wandered over\n\nthe prairie a great deal, with the prairie wind dirging for me through\n\nthe great prairie harp, of telephone wires,\n They hummed, they twanged and they seemed to endlessly adjust\n\nthemselves against, the prairie stillness\n I can remember barbed wire fences, and impaled on the barbs were\n\nbutterflies, grasshoppers, earthworms, maybe field mice\n\n\n\n\n<$A> \n\n they did it on the, buffalo berry bushes with those sharp thorns\n read bird prints on the\n\nsnow, the alternating dog tracks of a coyote, or the domino ones

that one uncovered, by\n\nWilder Penfield when he worked with the epileptic patient,\n You see art is the only thing humans do for its own sake, uh\n\nbesides the act of love \n\n<$A>  This explains perhaps the, great part that the arts play in\n\nculture\n Humans are the only animals who make poems plays novels drama\n They are the only animals who paint dance sing sculpt compose\n Artists

smells sights sounds tastes touches, feelings, and took\n\na creative leap\n Very frequently, it isn't a very large leap\n It stays very close to the unrefined resource\n Now let's refine, a little bit further from a autobiography\n\n\n\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  When you look at us as a biologist does we're not very\n\nimpressive\n We're not very fast,\n elephant can outrun the\n\nfastest human being on

survival trait of course, is a huge and complex brain\n\n<,>\n A brain that enabled us to recognize patterns in nature,\n Things like the, regularity of the tides of the seasons of\n\nanimal migration plant succession\n the human brain\n\nhas a built-in need for order \n And by creating order, out of chaos, we were able to uh\n\nanticipate events and to exploit that anticipation,    through   our predictive capacities for our greater\n\nsurvival,\n Thus, from that human brain emerged the concept, of,\n\nfuture\n Of course the future doesn't exist it's not real, it only\n\nexists, as an invention of the human brain\n But because we invented an idea like a future, it gifted us as\n\nno other animal has on this planet, with choice\n We can deliberately choose, from a variety of options and\n\nthereby plot our way into a number of different kinds of futures\n And for ninety-nine percent of our existence on earth that\n\nstrategy worked\n, We were able to flourish, and yet at the same time nature\n\n<,> seemed, infinitely abundant, and endlessly self-renewing,\n Today, we can see before our eyes that nature is no longer as\n\nvast as it   nor is it as\n\nresilient, as it has been in the past,\n Yet today with all of the amplified brain power of, global\n\ntelecommunications with computers with scientists and engineers, we no\n\nlonger seem able to do what our ancestors did\n To act deliberately by choosing an option that would give us the\n\nhighest survival attribute, or possibility\n And the question that we have to ask ourselves is why\n Why do we seem so paralyzed, today\n I've already participated in two days of, preliminary\n\ndiscussions here at Global Forum, and I'm afraid that, it's clear that\n\nwe still haven't established a discussion that deals with the fundamental\n\ncontext, within which we can assess, the human place in the planetary\n\necosphere\n tape cuts out briefly\n\n that we fail to recognize our absolute needs, as biological beings\n\n<,>\n In the discussions that I've heard about the north versus the\n\nsouth, in the need for greater input from women, from youth, from\n\nthe handicapped and indigenous people, there is

and biological diversity as any\n\nother living things\n These life support systems, air water soil and biodiversity,\n\nare what make our societies possible\n But today they are being torn apart by human numbers, by\n\npoverty and technological muscle power\n Science can not begin to comprehend the vast diversity of living\n\norganisms on earth and their interactions with each other, and the\n\nphysical properties of the world\n Yet we hack away at nature, as if it is infinitely renewable\n And we pour our industrial excreta into life support systems,\n As if somehow, air water soil, can absorb, dilute and\n\ndetoxify these poisons indefinitely\n We know for a fact, that human activity is now creating change\n\non a global scale that is unprecedented in scope, and speed,\n Our

escorting\n\npeople through the ruckus of the logging area to the gate, that the\n\nWestern Canada Wilderness Committee had built, that marked the beginning\n\nof a trail, into the rainforest\n It seemed as if all the racket, and the dry heat of the open\n\nclear-cut, vanished almost immediately as you dropped into this\n\nmagnificent humid temperate rainforest of ancient cedar, and Sitka spruce\n The soft songs of the winter wrens were all that could be heard,\n\nwithin minutes\n Even with my forestry education it was easy to question the wisdom\n\n<,> and sustainability of clear-cutting\n In British Columbia the free ride of the first harvest of old\n\ngrowth forests, is nearly over\n Companies now have excess mill capacity, and they're scrambling\n\nto buy logs from private lands in Alberta\n Amidst the crisis, the B C government is creating a Forest\n\nPractices Code\n It's an extensive set of very specific rules that industry will\n\nhave to follow, if they want to stay in business in British Columbia\n, calls B C's\n\nForest Practices Code, draconian\n He says the code is motive enough for Alberta's forest companies to\n\nimprove their practices, before Alberta winds up in the same situation as\n\nB C\n There's no question things are changing in B C, and in Alberta\n\n<,> but can things change soon enough to make a real ecological difference in\n\nthe woods\n thinks so\n She's an ecologist and a member of the steering committee that's\n\njust finished the second major draft of the Alberta Forest Conservation\n\nStrategy \n Scientists and Foresters alike seem to have discovered Mother\n\nNature\n represents Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries\n\nLimited, or ALPAC as it's known\n Faced with controversy at home and abroad this multi-national\n\nforestry company, isn't waiting for a new strategy\n It's creating its own brand of ecosystem management in northern\n\nAlberta \n Some critics grudgingly agree that ALPAC is onto something\n The old approach would be to simply go out and mow everything down\n\nin a patchwork of twenty to sixty hectare clear-cuts\n Ron Lowen\n\n, doesn't think, clear-cuts can be used as a substitute for fire\n\n\n insists, their\n\nclear-cuts aren't really clear-cuts \n In Alberta, the ground rules for logging allow maximum clear-cut\n\nsizes of sixty hectares for hardwoods like aspen, and thirty-two hectares\n\nfor soft wood, like spruce\n with Alberta's Lands and Forests\n\nService, the average is even lower \n says ALPAC has had discussions with government about\n\nincreasing their clear-cut sizes, but no formal requests have been made as\n\nof yet\n says, clear-cutting and the subsequent\n\nplanting of trees is not sustainable forestry, because it causes the loss\n\nof biological and genetic diversity\n He says trees, and forests are going to need diversity and\n\nadaptability to survive in a future world of air pollution, and global\n\nclimate change\n But, if companies or the province, are truly taking\n\ninspiration from nature, it could have significant implications for\n\nmanagement techniques\n about how, pesticides and herbicides\n\nfit into ALPAC's version of ecosystem management \n It's hard to say how the new Forest Conservation Strategy will\n\naffect forest management in Alberta, but we could know as early as this\n\nfall\n Next week, Alberta may be getting set to announce a new forestry\n\nmega project\n End of show\n\nsegment   \n\n\n\n<$B>  Do you know what Alberta's provincial tree is\n If you said aspen you'd receive top marks for knowing it's by far\n\nour most common tree\n But Alberta's provincial tree is actually the lodgepole pine\n The stately lodgepole pine is found throughout Alberta's foothills\n\n<,> mountains, and even in places like Cypress Hills and Peace River\n\ncountry\n This beautiful species is often found growing in stands of trees\n\nall the same age\n That's because forests of pine are often born of fire\n The cones of lodgepole pine are sealed shut by a sticky resin that\n\nprevents them from opening, until they're heated by fire or sun\n This and many other facts about Alberta trees are recorded in a\n\nbooklet entitled Trees of Reknown, published by the Alberta Forestry\n\nAssociation\n The tallest white spruce on record was a towering forty-five point\n\nsix metres\n It was found by logging crews in the Hinton area\n That's one hundred fifty feet tall, or taller than most fire\n\nlook-out towers in Alberta, and more than twice as tall as most other\n\ntrees\n The oldest tree on record is a limber pine, along the North\n\nSaskatchewan River\n It's reported to be more than one thousand years old\n This windswept limber pine is only eleven metres tall, but it is\n\nso wide it would take five adults to encircle the tree with their arms  \n\n\n\n<$A>  It was thanks to the Alberta Forest Service that I received my\n\nfirst introduction to the boreal forest\n When I was a student of forestry at the University of Alberta, I\n\nspent one summer working for the Forest Service, as a timber cruiser\n In a nutshell, this means I drove or flew, to some of the\n\nmost remote reaches of our northern forests to count and measure trees\n It was all part of Alberta's phase three Inventory of Forests\n What it meant was walking through hundreds of kilometres of remote\n\nvirgin boreal forests\n On the long and often hot days of summer, we discovered many\n\nwildlife species such as nesting great grey owls, black-backed woodpeckers\n\n<,> and bears, plenty of bears\n I'll never forget the experience\n I'll also never forget what it's like to share lunch with millions\n\nupon millions of insects\n Whether it's the Arctic grayling in the House River, or a\n\nspotted sandpiper in a wet open clearing in an old growth forest, mostly\n\nwhat I learned is the boreal forest is an amazingly diverse and beautiful\n\nplace\n What I didn't think much about, was why I was measuring all\n\nthese trees\n At the time the government had only allocated about twenty-five\n\npercent of the forests, it had earmarked for forestry operations\n Since then, the Alberta government has allocated most or some\n\nwould say all, of the remaining public forests\n Under a management scheme known as Sustained Yield Management,\n\nthe Forest Service allocates volumes of wood to private companies based on\n\nwhat they call, Annual Allowable Cut\n The theory is, if you cut the same amount of wood that grows in\n\na given year, it'll be sustainable over time\n of Alberta's Lands and Forests Service\n\n<,> how much of the Annual Allowable Cut is left unallocated in Alberta \n is quoting a recent government report called the\n\nStatus of Alberta's Timber Supply, and indeed the report says of the\n\ntwenty-two point one million cubic metres of wood available for cutting,\n\nfifteen percent, or more than three million cubic   \n\nmetres  , is unallocated\n, a forestry consultant\n\nand a former, manager of public policy and planning at the Lands and\n\nForests Service, this may not be the whole story \n In fact, according to Forest Service sources, virtually all\n\n<,> of the so-called unallocated harvest is already committed to\n\nDaishowa-Marubeni International, Alberta Newsprint and numerous other\n\ncompanies\n We've learned from several sources that only about half of one\n\npercent, of the coniferous and five percent of the deciduous annual\n\nallowable cut, has not been committed\n This means ninety-four point five percent of Alberta's annual\n\nallowable cut, has been committed to companies\n The Grande Alberta Paper Company is currently negotiating with the\n\nAlberta government for access to an estimated, eight hundred thousand\n\ncubic metres of wood\n if their needs could be satisfied,\n\nout of the existing allowable cut \n Throughout our forestry series, foresters have been telling us\n\nthat the Lands and Forests Service is moving from sustained yield management\n\n<,> to sustainable forest management\n\n\nsays, the Forest Service may adopt sustainable forest management, as\n\nearly as this fall \n This is ironic since the vast majority of Alberta's public forests\n\n<,> have already been allocated, or committed, under the old sustained\n\nyield model\n Since nineteen eighty-nine, the Forest Service has revised and\n\nreduced their provincial annual allowable cut figures, at least twice\n According to the Timber Supply Report, the annual allowable cut\n\nhas been reduced by four point three million cubic metres, or sixteen\n\npercent since nineteen eighty-nine\n told us he doesn't believe the forest resource\n\nis over-allocated at this time, and that he couldn't comment on whether\n\nthe government intends to allocate one hundred percent of the annual\n\nallowable cut\n This could be an important question, since dramatic previous\n\nadjustments and    annual   allowable cuts, and\n\nthe government's commitment to sustainable forest management and,\n\nunresolved land use issues such as the Special Places Two Thousand Program\n\ncould all affect the amount of timber available for harvesting\n Tina\n\nLavallee  \n, if bio and genetic\n\ndiversity and sustainable forestry, were considered in the government's\n\nannual allowable cut calculations\n the author of a report on\n\nbiodiversity in the Aspen forests, there may not be enough room in some of\n\nthe older forest management agreements to accommodate sustainable forest\n\nmanagement\n He says new techniques that would be needed to protect things like\n\nbiodiversity, could leave some areas squeezed for timber \n a professor of Forestry at the University\n\nof Alberta agrees\n He says he doesn't believe sustainable development, biodiversity\n\nor ecosystem management can be accommodated within current annual allowable\n\ncut levels\n He warns, some forest management agreements may have to reduce\n\ntheir harvest levels, to accommodate the changes\n of the Forest Service counters, that other\n\nresources have been considered, and that the government's approach is\n\nconservative \n So can Alberta support another forestry mega project\n The answer isn't simple\n says if Grande Alberta Paper goes ahead, part of\n\nthe wood supply would come from the unallocated forest, and the rest would\n\ncome in the form of residual chips from existing sawmills\n If Grande Alberta Paper and the government come to a tentative\n\nagreement on a wood supply, there is still the hurdle of the Natural\n\nResources Conservation Board\n And, the N R C B has already indicated that for the first time\n\never, forest harvesting would be examined in addition to mill site impacts\n\n<,> before any approval is given \n\n\n\n<$B>  Foresters used to call aspen trees weeds\n Elk often gnaw on the bark of these trees when they're hungry\n Bears often mark the aspen's smooth white trunk with their

without organic matter becomes in effect a surrogate mother\n\nrequiring additional inputs to produce crops\n Technology is able to compensate for depletion of the soil\n Chemical fertilizers and

The first is a catalytic converter that would sell for around ten\n\ndollars and could reduce emissions by up to fifty percent\n The second solution being investigated is alternative fuels that\n\ncould reduce carbon monoxide pollution by as much as sixty percent\n Part of the problem is we all use these small engines at the same\n\ntime, and since carbon monoxide is about the same density as air it just\n\nhangs around poisoning you as you do your lawn\n Fuel spillage is also a problem as hydrocarbons are rapidly\n\nreleased into the air whenever you miss the tank,\n The State of California already has plans to force manufacturers to\n\ncut emissions by two-thirds by the year nineteen ninety-nine\n But you could do your part today by keeping your engine tuned or

close\n\nto impossible \n the protection of wilderness is more than just\n\nan aesthetic it's absolutely necessary \n\n The United Nations Brundtland Commission on Environment and Economy\n\nreported in nineteen eighty-seven that protected areas need to be at least\n\ntripled to constitute a representative sample of the Earth's ecosystems\n The commission also indicated that saving species in their\n\necosystems is an indispensable prerequisite for sustainable development\n When Alberta wrote its own sustainable development plan the\n\ncompletion of a system of protected areas was front and centre\n Today we begin a series of programs that will examine how Alberta\n\nis doing at protecting natural ecosystems,\n a naturalist an Albertan with\n\na very special appreciation of the world

ecosystems \n\n\n\n<$A>  There's been a long and distinguished history of creating\n\nparks and wilderness areas in Alberta\n It began in eighteen eighty-five with the establishment of Banff\n\nCanada's first national park\n Since then Waterton Lakes Jasper Elk Island and Wood Buffalo\n\nNational Parks have been created\n At almost forty-five thousand square kilometres Wood Buffalo is the\n\nlargest national park in the western hemisphere\n But according to the Alberta government reports most of Alberta's\n\ndiverse ecosystems are still unprotected and in some cases vanishing\n Today we present part two in our series on protecting Alberta's\n\nendangered ecosystems\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  of the Alberta Wilderness\n\nAssociation\n Alberta is short of protected areas\n This may come as a surprise to many people who already know that\n\nAlberta's blessed with some of the most beautiful parks in the world\n But most of these parks were established to protect economic\n\ninterests or national curiosities and not ecosystems per se\n Alberta's a wonderfully biologically diverse province\n Ecologists divide Alberta into six major natural regions the\n\nGrasslands Aspen parkland Boreal forest Foothills Rocky Mountains and\n\nCanadian Shield\n These six natural regions are further divided into twenty natural\n\nsubregions\n Alan Van Dusen\n\n the natural regions that are most endangered are the ones we live in\n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$A>  The idea of protecting Alberta's ecosystems has been around in\n\ndraft government reports and policies since the late nineteen seventies and\n\nearly nineteen eighties but it wasn't until nineteen ninety-five when Ty Lund\n\nAlberta's environment minister released the Special Places Two Thousand plan\n\nthat it became government policy to protect ecosystems\n of the University of\n\nAlberta this is important because for the first time Alberta's agreed to a\n\nscientific approach to protect ecosystems\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  According to the Alberta government's nineteen ninety-five\n\nState of the Environment report only four of Alberta's twenty natural\n\nsubregions are adequately represented\n They include the Alpine Subalpine and Montane Natural Subregions in\n\nthe Rocky Mountains and the Peace River Lowlands in the Boreal forest\n If the government's own assessment of its progress isn't bad enough\n\nthere's a scientific debate going on as to whether the Montane is adequately\n\nprotected\n explains\n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$A>  says that more than five hundred and fifty\n\nsquare kilometres of montane in Jasper and Banff National Parks is severely\n\ncompromised\n what indicators tell us that\n\nthings aren't well in the Montane\n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$A>  Very little comes easily in the struggle to protect Alberta's\n\nnatural regions and the options diminish with each passing day\n Less than twenty percent of the original Grasslands are left and\n\nas little as five percent of the Aspen parkland remains today\n The World Wildlife Fund recently awarded Alberta a B for progress\n\non protecting endangered spaces\n That's a major improvement over the F it received a year ago\n Alberta was recognized because environment minister Ty Lund\n\npromised to protect Alberta's ecoregions by nineteen ninety-eight and for\n\nlegally protecting Willmore Wilderness Park north of Jasper\n Since the program was launched Alberta has created two new\n\nprovincial parks twenty-seven new natural areas and one new ecological\n\nreserve\n That's it for this week's feature report\n Next week the Environment Minister has promised to protect\n\nexamples of all of Alberta's natural regions by nineteen ninety-eight\n Can it be done\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  Alberta has a colourful history of creating parks and\n\nprotected areas\n It all began with the protection of Banff Hot Springs as a Crown\n\nreserve in eighteen eighty-five\n Two years later in eighteen eighty-seven Rocky Mountains National\n\nPark was established,\n Little known to most people three national parks have been created\n\nand abolished in Alberta's history\n In nineteen oh eight Buffalo National Park was created near\n\nWainwright to protect bison,\n Wawaskesy and Nemiskam National Parks were created in nineteen\n\ntwenty-two to save the prong-horned antelope\n All three were abolished by nineteen forty-seven, because the\n\nantelope came back and bison were being protected elsewhere in Wood Buffalo\n\nNational Park\n If these parks existed today though they would protect some of\n\nAlberta's most endangered ecosystems,\n In nineteen thirty-two Alberta created its first four provincial\n\nparks Aspen Beach Gooseberry Lake Park Lake and Saskatoon Island\n Today these small parks are among the most popular recreation\n\nsites in Alberta\n That's it for this week's Ecofacts and Trends\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  Alberta has been blessed with some of the most spectacular\n\nlandscapes you'll find anywhere\n But as oil and gas agriculture forestry and cities push to the\n\nlast frontiers the province's natural ecosystems have begun to show signs of\n\nstress\n Alberta's Special Places Two Thousand program seeks to ensure\n\nexamples of those rare and beautiful natural landscapes are preserved for\n\nfuture generations\n But critics argue the program is so full of holes you can drive\n\noil rigs and logging trucks through them\n Today we present part three in our series on protecting Alberta's\n\nendangered ecosystems\n A nineteen

sustainable development\n In Alberta however there is no formal monitoring of our progress on\n\nsustainable development\n The Alberta Roundtable did come up with fifty-nine indicators for\n\nmeasuring sustainable development but most of these indicators are not being\n\nused in the government's annual report\n The majority of indicators are still traditional measures of\n\neconomic performance such as G D P jobs and the cost of transportation\n But that's only half of the sustainable development equation\n What's missing are indicators that would raise red flags signalling\n\nthreats to the environment\n if there are indicators that could\n\nhelp balance off the economic ones already in place\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  There's a flurry of sustainable development activity going on\n\ninside government but it's hard to see results on the ground\n This radio series was inspired by the Alberta Roundtable report\n Throughout this series we will assess Alberta's progress on the\n\nfifty-nine indicators of sustainable development identified by the Roundtable\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  Technology may not hold all the answers to creating a\n\nsustainable future but according to  Tim Lee  at A G T Limited the\n\ncreation of fibre optics has radically improved the efficiency of\n\ntelecommunications\n Fibre optic wires are made out of plain everyday sand\n Not only is the process of mining sand far cleaner than mining\n\ncopper the wires are one thousand times more efficient\n This means one pair of fibre optic wires can handle thirty thousand\n\ntelephone calls at once, compared to just twenty-four on a pair of\n\nold-fashioned copper wires\n When it comes to Alberta's wetlands the story is not quite so\n\npositive\n According to Alberta Environmental Protection the number of\n\nmarshlands in Alberta declined by more than thirty percent between nineteen\n\nseventy and nineteen ninety\n To try and save wetlands the North American Waterfowl

Trends\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  Alberta's economy runs on natural resources\n From the oil and gas industry to the coal-fired power plants that\n\nprovide our electricity Alberta's dependent on its natural resources\n Agriculture forestry and tourism round off a suite of renewable\n\nnatural resources that Albertans depend on\n How does a province of oil barons loggers miners and farmers deal\n\nwith some very real global environmental problems\n Today we asked Ty Lund Alberta's Minister of the Environment what\n\nAlberta's doing to create a sustainable future\n In Alberta perhaps unlike anywhere else in Canada people are\n\nreminded of their dependence on natural resources every two weeks when they\n\ncollect their paycheques\n Most jobs in Alberta are linked in some way to the exploitation of\n\nnatural resources\n Oil and gas still make up a majority of provincial revenues\n Ty Lund knows this well\n He's the Minister of the Environment and a two-term Conservative M\n\nL A  from Rocky Mountain House\n I asked Ty Lund what he thinks the big sustainable development\n\nissues are for Alberta\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  Lund's concerns about greenhouse gas emissions is tempered\n\nhowever by his concern that Alberta might lose oil and gas business\n In fact he says if Alberta reduced production of natural gas it\n\nmight be bad for the environment because those markets would still be filled\n\nby other countries with lower environmental standards\n\n<$Z>  interview between A and Z, 1 min 40\n\nsec \n\n<$A>  The government's annual report is chock full of economic\n\nindicators such as the amount of grain produced timber harvested or the low\n\nprices Alberta charges for utilities and trucking, but rarely does it look\n\nat the quality and sustainability of the ecological systems that produce the\n\nresources\n The report of the Alberta Roundtable endorsed by the Alberta\n\ngovernment in nineteen ninety-three states there are consumption limits to\n\nthe Earth's resources and that the increasing rate of consumption and the\n\nexploding world population are the largest contributors to the global\n\nenvironmental crisis\n I asked Ty Lund if he believes there are limits to consumption\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  Some scientists say we're already running a global\n\nenvironmental deficit but the division between those who think vigorous\n\neconomic growth can save us and those who think reduced consumption can save\n\nus is the Grand Canyon of voids\n In March nineteen ninety-five the Ensuring Prosperity taskforce\n\nmade twenty-four recommendations to change our ways\n Among many suggestions it proposed the injection of sustainable\n\ndevelopment into the school curriculum and the creation of a mechanism to\n\ncoordinate and implement sustainable development\n I asked Mister Lund if all of the recommendations are being\n\nimplemented\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  Many critics see monitoring and reporting on sustainable\n\ndevelopment progress as the Achilles heel of sustainable development\n They say that without transparent and independent monitoring it\n\nwill be too easy to cook the books\n If sustainable development is as important as the government says\n\nit is critics wonder why no one is in charge of it\n The federal government is creating an independent environmental\n\nauditor like the Auditor General\n I asked Mister Lund if he's developing a similar process here\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  Another suggestion of the taskforce was a review of taxes and\n\nfees for their impact on sustainable development\n In Sweden the government there has recently reduced income tax by\n\nfour percent and replaced it with environmental taxes on S O two and C O two\n\ngases related to acid deposition and global warming\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  For

ever wondered how many species of life there are in\n\nCanada\n According to Ted Mosquin Don McAllister and Peter Whiting the\n\nauthors of a new book on Canada's biodiversity there are seventy-one thousand\n\nspecies of life in Canada,\n But those are only the discovered species\n The scientists estimate there are sixty-eight thousand more species\n\nnot yet discovered by science, and for each species of life there is at\n\nleast one more species of virus\n If you're keeping tabs the answer is, there are two hundred\n\neighty thousand species of life in Canada,\n When you factor environmental costs into things the results can be\n\nsurprising\n According to the World Watch Institute burning a gallon of gasoline\n\nin the U S costs the driver about one dollar twenty cents but

{'text': "<$A>  Jose Lopez Portillo, was the President of Mexico from\n\nnineteen seventy-six to nineteen eighty-two,\n He ascended to his presidency on the wave of new petroleum\n\ndiscoveries, and the OPEC oil bonanza\n It seemed as if Mexico was well on its way to achieving full\n\neconomic development,\n So what happened,\n Lopez Portillo used Mexico's oil to borrow additional capital in an\n\nambitious plan to turn his nation from a Third, to a First World country\n His strategy made sense initially,\n Petroleum prices were expected to rise well into the eighties,\n Commercial bankers in other countries were eager to lend money to\n\nMexico, in an attempt to recycle the billions of petrol dollars, that\n\nArab countries had placed on deposit with them,\n This lending strategy seemed to work well for the first years of\n\nPortillo's term,\n Huge investments were made in roads, ports, and heavy\n\nindustry,\n The economy boomed and hundreds of thousands of new jobs were\n\ncreated,\n Unprecedented spending occurred in areas such as health and\n\neducation,\n The greater availability of wealth also translated into an\n\nastronomical increase in governmental waste and corruption,\n As the international playing field changed in nineteen eighty-one\n\n<,> Mexico's heydays of success and overnight riches ground to a halt,\n Oil prices began to fall, in response to the collapse of the\n\nOPEC cartel, and the economic recession in the United States, and other\n\nindustrialized countries,\n Lopez Portillo, thinking that the price downturn was nothing but\n\na temporary blip, in an otherwise upward curve, continued his ambitious\n\nspending,\n He replaced oil revenues with massive amounts of foreign borrowing\n\n<,>\n The bubble finally burst in nineteen eighty-two when the\n\ninternational banking community effectively cut Mexico off,\n Lopez Portillo was unable to obtain enough money to service his\n\ngovernment's existing debts,\n With his term drawing to a close, and knowing that he would\n\nforever be remembered as  the  president, who mortgaged the country\n\nto ruin, he nationalized the Mexican banking system,\n Now the rationale for that was to stop the huge flight of capital\n\nthat was occurring, out of Mexico\n Mexican bankers and industrialists had panicked, and millions of\n\ndollars were sent to safety in the United States and Europe,\n Portillo's actions came too late however to stop the draining of\n\nmillions of dollars from the National Reserve,\n After Portillo's term was over, the new President on the block\n\nwas de la Madrid, who was elected in nineteen eighty-two,\n Initially, de la Madrid did not differ greatly from Portillo in\n\nhis ultimate vision, for Mexico,\n He too wanted to bring Mexico, within his term, into the\n\nprivate club of the First World nations\n Economically though things went from bad to worse,\n At the beginning of his term, Mexico was still able to get forty\n\ndollars per barrel of oil on the international market,\n Only four years later, that price would plummet to ten dollars\n\nper barrel,\n Facing an eighty-five billion dollar debt, de la Madrid imposed\n\nharsh austerity measures\n Imports were cut,\n The public sector was slashed,\n Government-owned corporations were privatized, and government\n\nsubsidies to all groups were reduced,\n By nineteen eighty-five Mexican officials decided that this I M F\n\nstyle of reform wasn't working\n Instead, the country would have to become more outwardly focused\n\n<,> more competitive, and more export-oriented,\n de la Madrid moved quickly onto the fast track, removing import\n\nlicences reducing tariffs and, courting foreign investors\n moves\n\n  focused on the northern border region, the Maquiladora area\n Approximately three hundred plants were owned by U S companies at\n\nthat time,\n The Maquiladora factories employed, more than forty thousand\n\nMexican workers, and produced five hundred millions dollars worth of goods\n\nannually,\n This area alone didn't make much of an impact, in the economic\n\nequation though,\n Because in nineteen eighty-five, interest payments alone came to\n\na staggering fourteen billion dollars, more than fifty-five percent of the\n\ncountry's export earnings,\n With the implementation of economic reforms, the gap between the\n\nvery poor, and the very rich grew exponentially\n By the mid-eighties, for every hundred pesos that a poor Mexican\n\nwas earning, two thousand pesos would be pocketed by a rich Mexican\n The funds that had been channeled towards social programs during\n\nLopez Portillo's reign, all but dried up,\n Even though both the middle and upper classes had grown\n\nsubstantially, since the turn of the century, the poorest element of\n\nsociety still constituted the largest percentage of the total population,\n Since the nineteen thirties, peasants have been migrating to\n\nurban areas in ever increasing numbers, and this movement has exploded\n\nsince the early eighties\n This migratory flood hasn't been adequately planned for by\n\ngovernment pundits, and the strain that's been put on the public services\n\n<,> has created a permanent underclass living at the bottom level of urban\n\nsociety\n The informal work sector has been flooded by people of all ages,\n\nwho try to scratch out a living polishing shoes, selling newspapers, or\n\nany number of cheap goods in the street,\n Urban dwellers who have traditionally, been seen by the Mexican\n\ngovernment as potential sources of political instability, have\n\ntraditionally had their basic food stuffs subsidized,\n Beans flour, and tortillas, as well as commodities such as\n\ngas, public transportation and electricity, had all been covered\n The de la Madrid administration decided that it could no longer\n\nafford the scale of subsidies, so a harsh blow was dealt to the urban poor\n\n<,,>\n Tensions are likely to increase as more Mexicans continue to flood\n\nfrom politically isolated rural settings to urban ones\n With greater access to information on politics, and governmental\n\nmismanagement, fertile ground exists for popular political organization\n\n<,>\n A prime example of urban discontent was seen immediately following\n\nthe earthquake, which devastated Mexico City, in nineteen eighty-five\n\n<,>\n The government was painfully slow, in the area of reconstruction\n\nand so non-governmental groups mobilized and completed the work largely\n\nthrough their own efforts,\n By nineteen eighty-seven the austerity measures and the tightening\n\nof the Mexican, economic belt on the part of the private sector,\n\nresulted in an unemployment rate of eighteen percent,\n Another twenty-five to thirty-five percent of the population was\n\nunderemployed, in jobs that barely provided for their basic needs\n Between nineteen eighty-two and nineteen eighty-seven, real\n\nminimum wages fell about forty-two percent, and  the   record inflation rates\n The only group that wasn't left scarred by the abysmal economic\n\nsituation was the very wealthy,\n Until nineteen eighty-eight, the governing party, the\n\nInstitutional Revolutionary Party or the P R I had been able to deflect the\n\nblame for the poor economic performance on others, the Church, greedy\n\ncorrupt bureaucrats, and money-grubbing foreigners,\n The P R I has been called the best hidden dictatorship in the world\n\n<,>\n It's retained exclusive power for the last seventy-odd years,\n\nand has proved itself remarkably adept, until recently, at adapting to\n\nwhatever political crisis may be thrown its way,\n The governing P R I has been able to survive until now because of\n\nits rather octopus-like structure\n Its political tentacles have reached into all sectors of society\n\n<,> from labour to big business,\n In the past, the regime proved itself capable of responding to\n\nserious threats to its authority by enacting reforms, that undercut\n\npopular resentment,\n Widespread agrarian reforms in the early part of the century,\n\nwere probably the best example of this undercutting,\n\n\n peasant discontent, and land pressures at the same time\n Such a modern day panacea is not forthcoming however,\n Popular resentment came to a head in the nineteen eighty-eight\n\nnational elections, as support for the P R I, for the first time ever\n\n<,> declined sharply,\n The revolutionary nationalist image that was seventy years in the\n\nmaking for, P R I governments, is beginning to look a bit shoddy,\n One of the principal continuous platforms of the P R I has been\n\nthat Mexico must be politically sovereign,\n The giving up of national economic sovereignty, to foreign\n\nadjustors, primarily Americans, does not fit well with Mexican public\n They see that it is not just the domestic market, that is under\n\nsiege, but Mexican foreign policy as well,\n An outstanding example of Mexico's loss of integrity, was seen\n\nin their dealings with Central America,\n The American government demanded that Mexico cease and desist with\n\nall oil shipments to Ortega's Nicaragua,\n They were also strongly advised to back off from any,\n\ninvolvement in the Central American peace proposals, which were hotly\n\nopposed by Washington,\n Mexico was, and still is strongly affected by the wishes of its\n\ncreditors\n demands\n\n  of the Reagan administration, dealing a blow to its already\n\nshaken international image,\n Perhaps even more damaging than the perceived loss of external\n\npolitical sovereignty, has been the breakdown of traditional\n\nshock-absorbing groups within Mexico,\n The P R I, in its octopus form, through coercion or co-option\n\n<,> had given an institutional voice to labour, the peasantry, and the\n\npopular sector,\n These three groups had guaranteed access to participate in the\n\ndecision-making that affected their groups\n However, with the implementation of austerity measures, the\n\nability of these groups to negotiate, and to find solutions to their  demands has been greatly reduced,\n The Trade Union Confederations lost their ability to win benefits\n\nfor union members,\n They were also unable to maintain wage and employment levels,\n As workers saw a rapid decline in their living standards, and\n\ntheir inability to match their wages to rapidly rising prices, discontent\n\nhas grown\n The P R I corporate octopus is crumbling,\n As disillusionment with the P R I becomes widespread, and\n\nindividuals within Mexican society begin to agitate, new social movements\n\nhave begun to emerge,\n For the most part they've been limited in their focus revolving\n\noftentimes around a single specific interest,\n Without the promise of benefits from the government, these\n\nvoices are no longer being incorporated into, or silenced by the\n\nmonolithic, government structure,\n The decline of the Institutional Revolutionary Party in Mexico,\n\nis a result of the fact that it can no longer hand out the cookies and\n\ncarrots that it has grown accustomed to,\n Traditionally Mexican politics were defined by who got the\n\nresources and benefits, rather than by popular representation,\n Now, the P R I's actions are restricted by the economic\n\nhandcuffs which it has assumed,\n The political crisis which is occurring now is a direct result,\n\nof political inability to control the economy,\n The increasing rich-poor gap, the squeezing of austerity\n\nmeasures on those classes that can least bear them, and the disintegration\n\nof traditional channels of communication between the P R I monolith and\n\nsociety, have all given fuel to the political crisis,\n The economic bust after years of petrol plenty have meant that the\n\nP R I is no longer able to co-opt and assimilate dissenting voices,\n The economic crisis of the eighties has been the root cause of the\n\npresent-day political crisis, in the Mexican system,\n Unless the price of oil skyrockets again, or platinum is found\n\nin copious amounts on Mexican soil the morally and economically bankrupt\n\nMexican government will have difficulty stemming, the tumultuous wave of\n\nchange which is sure to come\n\n\n CABS 1-2\n\n\n The demonstrators predict, President Carlos Salinas, will die\n\nin election year, after stepping out of a cabinet meeting where he's told\n\npollution is under control, and yet chokes to death, for lack of oxygen\n\n<,,>\n I feel some days myself as if I could choke to death,\n Today's paper says there was no thermal inversion yesterday, so\n\nthat means the air quality index today is unsatisfactory\n The lead content is sixty percent above the accepted maximum,\n\nozone is rated at one hundred and ninety that's just eleven points away from\n\nbeing considered dangerous,\n And there is always a permanent oily smell in the air,\n Among foreigners anyway when greeting fellow countrymen, the\n\ntalk is

the far north,\n\nto the pure stands of lodgepole pine in the foothills, Alberta's blessed\n\nwith a diversity of forests, but not with a large number of species of\n\ntrees\n In fact, just six species, aspen, white spruce,\n\nlodgepole and jack pine, balsam poplar and black spruce make up\n\nninety-seven percent of the volume of wood, on Alberta's so-called\n\nproductive forest land\n The province considers just over half of the forest land or\n\nthirty-five percent of Alberta as productive commercial forests\n The theory of modern sustained yield forest management, is that\n\nif it takes a hundred years to grow a tree, you only cut one one-hundredth\n\nof the trees each year\n And if you do that you'll be able to cut trees forever\n is a well-known authour and a widely respected\n\necologist\n I asked him if current forest management practices, are\n\nsustainable \n In fact, of the seven foresters we interviewed, including two\n\nwell-known independent ecologists a former chief forester of a private\n\ncompany three prominent government foresters and one academic none would say\n\nour forests are sustainable under present management\n what are the indicators that our forests\n\naren't sustainable \n is saying that the model of\n\nsustained yield forest management, was designed to meet economic\n\nobjectives, but it doesn't protect biodiversity or the other non-fibre\n\nvalues in the forest, and as a consequence it may not even ensure a\n\nsustained yield of fibre, over the long-term\n Alberta's first pulp mill was opened in nineteen fifty-four in\n\nHinton, by Northwestern Pulp and Power Limited\n It was about that time when Reg Loomis Alberta's first professional\n\nforester took the reins on behalf of the government\n Using aerial photographs he pioneered management of Alberta's\n\nforest, on a sustained yield basis\n The theory is that timber harvesting will be forever sustainable\n\n<,> if you cut only the amount of wood that grows each year\n In essence you live off the interest of tree growth, without\n\never cutting into the principal\n It was a very progressive concept and Loomis made sure the concept\n\nworked its way into the province's very first forest management agreement\n Today, there is growing recognition that forests especially\n\npublic forests, should be managed to sustain everything in the forest not\n\njust the volume of timber\n is a forestry consultant with the Forestry\n\nCompany in McBride British Columbia\n He used to be the chief forester of Ziedler Forest Products in\n\nEdmonton\n I asked him, if what we're doing in the forests is sustainable\n\n\n is a forester with the Alberta government\n He is working on the model forest in Hinton and the province's\n\nforest conservation strategy\n on the question of fibre\n\nsustainability\n He thinks in most instances fibre production is sustainable, but\n\nhe does agree that sustainable forest management is more than just fibre\n\nproduction \n In fact, there's a quiet revolution going on in the woods\n Driven by the potentially explosive repercussions of the\n\nmarketplace, a new kind of forestry, may be emerging\n a forester with the Land and Forests Service\n\n<,> says the move, is from sustained yield, to sustainable forest\n\nmanagement \n By now, you're probably beginning to realize that sustainability\n\nin the forest can be a bit of a shell game\n But the debate, is about sustaining forests and not just trees\n Next week, we'll try to find out what forest sustainability is\n\n<,> and what's being done to ensure Alberta's forests are going to be around\n\nfor future generations   \n\n\n\n<$B>  Forests cover about two-thirds of Alberta, and most of the\n\nforest is relatively young\n About seventy percent is less than a hundred and twenty years old\n Fire is probably the most important natural force in Alberta's\n\nforest ecosystems\n More than seventy-five percent of Alberta's forests have burned in\n\nthe last fifty years, and unlike the temperate rainforests of B C , Alberta's forests are composed mostly of a half\n\ndozen species or so\n One out of every two trees in Alberta is an aspen\n Aspen is that handsome white bark tree seen in groves throughout\n\nthe province's forested ecosystems\n Aspen and balsam poplar are in the Salicaceae family, along with\n\nwillows, and this is where acetylsalicylic acid or aspirin was derived\n\nfrom\n In fact almost half of the medicines prescribed today were\n\noriginally derived from plants, and that is partly why protecting\n\nbiodiversity in forests, has become a world-wide issue \n\n\n\n<$A>  In nineteen eighty-five, only about one quarter of the\n\nannual allowable cut of trees was allocated to forest companies in Alberta\n The annual allowable cut is calculated, based on the annual\n\ngrowth rate of trees\n If a tree takes one hundred years to grow, then your allowable\n\ncut is one one-hundredth of the trees in your forest\n Today, ninety-five percent of the coniferous or pine spruce and\n\nfir allowable cut, has been allocated, and seventy-three percent of the\n\ndeciduous trees such as aspen, have been promised to forestry companies\n More public forest lands have been allocated to forestry operations\n\nin the last decade, than in all of Alberta's previous history\n It was the government of premier Donald Getty that looked to\n\nforestry, when Alberta faced plunging oil prices in the mid\n\nnineteen-eighties\n As a sustainable development strategy the concept of harvesting\n\ntrees may not be a bad idea, but in the headlong rush to develop Alberta's\n\nnorthern forests some critics argue, wildlife biodiversity and science\n\nwere left behind\n Today, spurred on by environmental protests abroad and\n\ncontroversy at home, forest companies are making changes\n Overharvesting in British Columbia and some very public fights over\n\npollution, and allocation of the public forests in Alberta have tarnished\n\nforestry's image\n The industry's scrambling to improve its image and protect its\n\nmarkets\n In the early nineteen-nineties the Alberta government's answer was\n\nto write a new vision for government that called for ecosystem sustainability\n It was largely a symbolic beginning, but the word ecosystem had\n\nfinally crept into the practice of forestry\n is a policy advisor with the Alberta\n\ngovernment \n Ecosystem sustainability may have become part of the language of\n\nthe day, but the indicators of success in forestry were still annual\n\nallowable cut, and reforestation\n Both are indicators of fibre production, but not forest\n\nsustainability\n In last week's program nearly every forester we spoke to agreed\n\nthat what's being practised today, is sustained yield management and not\n\nsustainable forest management\n Understanding the difference between these two concepts is\n\ncritical in sorting out the important issues in forestry today\n is the ecologist who wrote the book on\n\nCanada's forest ecosystems\n and more\n\nrecently he wrote  Home Short Pieces on Ecological Subjects \n I asked him how he would define, sustainable forest management\n\n\n idea is to pass the forests on to our children\n\n<,> in the same condition, as they were given to us\n This sounds reminiscent of sustainable development as defined by\n\nthe United Nations Brentland Commission\n shares\n\n Lathe's  view, and elaborates \n says if poor management results in a deficit\n\n<,> for either the choice of our children, or in the land's productive\n\ncapacity, we will have in effect stolen resources from our children\n That's how two well-known ecologists would define sustainable\n\nforest management, but what about government\n is the senior policy advisor who\n\nrepresented Alberta when the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers defined\n\nsustainable forest management, and created a system of indicators \n The system of eighty-three indicators created by the Forestry\n\nMinisters is far more complex than the loan indicator now being used by the\n\nAlberta government in its annual, measuring up report\n It also adds significantly to the traditional indicators such as\n\nreforestation success, and annual allowable cut, however according to\n\n Samuel Lamberthad , the Alberta government is also creating its\n\nown definition, of sustainable forest management \n Critics of the forest conservation strategy charge that talk is\n\ncheap\n says the government intends to\n\nredefine the way it does forestry, based on the definition of sustainable\n\nforest management that emerges from the process\n Next week, could sustainable forest management mean an end

century\n of the Pembina Institute in Drayton\n\nValley why we should worry about the greenhouse effect in Alberta\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  If global warming were simply a matter of ecosystems moving\n\nnorth perhaps the consequences wouldn't be so bad but as Doctor  Morris\n\nSengorem  of the University of Calgary explains ecosystems don't change\n\novernight\n\n<$ZA> \n\n<$A>  So the climate may change enough to move an ecosystem such as\n\nthe boreal forest north but the soils can't just pick up and come along for\n\nthe ride\n The boreal forest would essentially be caught between a heat wave\n\nand the underdeveloped soils of the sub arctic\n if such outcomes represent worst\n\ncase scenarios\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  In nineteen ninety Lucien Bouchard then the federal\n\nEnvironment Minister committed Canada to stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions\n\nat nineteen ninety levels by the year two thousand\n The federal government's answer to stabilizing greenhouse gas\n\nemissions is the Voluntary Challenge\n But since nineteen ninety Alberta's carbon dioxide emissions have\n\nincreased by fifteen percent making Alberta the largest greenhouse gas\n\nproducing province in Canada\n is with Alberta Environmental Protection\n\n<$ZB> \n\n<$A>  The Pembina Institute did an analysis of the first hundred and\n\neighty-nine submissions to the Voluntary Challenge Registry in Ottawa and\n\naccording to  Hubert Daring  the results are less than inspiring\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  Officials from Alberta's Energy Department told us they're\n\nexcited by the high levels of participation and that it's a question of\n\nwhether the glass is half full or half empty\n They say flaws in the voluntary system will be cleaned up in round\n\ntwo and that we have to give corporations a chance to show results\n of Alberta's Clean Air Strategic\n\nAlliance Alberta's fossil fuel industries are very concerned about this issue\n\n<$ZC> \n\n<$A>  But just as concern over greenhouse gases is building two of\n\nAlberta's largest greenhouse gas producers are talking about major expansions\n Suncor and Syncrude in Fort McMurray are already responsible for\n\nproducing eight percent of Alberta's carbon dioxide emissions\n Environmental Specialist for\n\nSuncor the company will reduce C O two emissions back to nineteen ninety\n\nlevels by two thousand and five\n This while doubling producion of oil\n\n<$ZD> \n\n<$A>  In the struggle to put the brakes on global warming we know\n\nthat all fossil fuels are not created equal\n coal produces twice as much\n\ncarbon dioxide as natural gas and oil produces about one and a half times as\n\nmuch\n Oil sands synthetic crude on the other hand produces ten times as\n\nmuch C O two as conventional crude oils says  Daring \n This may be why some American states are so interested in Alberta\n\nnatural gas\n If they replace coal with natural gas they could reduce their\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions by as much as fifty percent\n The trouble is Alberta gets the C O two bill for producing the\n\nnatural gas\n energy switching and efficiency\n\nare only part of the first step in curbing greenhouse gas emissions\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  Despite that fossil fuels appear to present significant and\n\nunaccounted environmental cost movements towards renewable energy continue at\n\na snail's pace\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  Canada is responsible for two percent of the greenhouse gas\n\nemissions on Earth\n While China releases four and a half times as many greenhouse gas\n\nemissions the average Canadian is responsible for seven hundred and fifty\n\npercent more emissions than the average Chinese\n Among Canadian provinces Alberta is the greenhouse kingpin,\n Not only is Alberta the largest emitting province in Canada carbon\n\ndioxide emissions have grown by fifteen percent since nineteen ninety,\n This despite Canada's promise to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions\n\nat nineteen ninety levels by the year two thousand,\n There are some glimmers of hope however\n Gas companies like Nova are looking for ways to curb their\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions,\n Traditionally before work was done on a pipeline the gas was vented\n\ninto the atmosphere\n By using compressors to push the gas into sealed areas of the\n\npipeline repair crews can now minimize the methane released while making\n\nrepairs\n Nova estimates this one change is preventing nine thousand tonnes\n\nof methane from being released each year\n Methane is eleven times more potent than carbon

to protect South\n\nMoresby National Park on Canada's west coast in the mid nineteen eighties\n It was the largest and most successful park campaign ever mounted\n\nin Canada, involving people from coast to coast\n He began this campaign after living and working with the Haida\n\npeople in the Queen Charlotte Islands for almost a decade\n Before it was over the Conservative federal environment minister of\n\nthe day had kissed the earth and pledged to create a national park there,\n later, led a world tour to expose the plight of\n\nthe Penan people of Borneo who were losing their

find\n\nsustainable development solutions  Jim Hanley  has been observing\n\nhelping and ultimately trying to save sustainable cultures around the globe\n how he thinks Canada is doing at\n\npracticing sustainable development\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  Humans have lived on the Earth for about three point five\n\nmillion years\n For most of that time humans lived as hunter-gatherers\n The

practicing\n\nit\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  The sago palm is one of more than fifteen hundred palm species\n\nin this hundred and sixty million year old rainforest ecosystem\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  The Mentawai culture is just one example of a so-called\n\nprimitive society living and working sustainably in their ecosystem,\n For many of us in western society the dream of a utopian life in\n\nthe serene suburbs has turned into long commutes high stress and a distinct\n\nshortage    of leisure   time\n not suggeting we all immediately adopt the\n\nlifestyle of the Mentawai people but perhaps their's and the cultures of\n\nothers around the world can each provide a piece of the answer in our search\n\nfor sustainability\n Next week we continue our journey through culture and sustainable\n\ndevelopment with author  Jim Hanley \n We'll find out how the Penan of Borneo met Saks of Fifth Avenue in\n\nNew York and how car sales in southeast Asia are turning rainforests into\n\nrubber plantations\n You're listening to the Chevron Ecofile\n with this week's Ecofacts and\n\nTrends \n\n\n\n<$A>  Here's something a little different this week\n From the recent Sustainable Edmonton Society's Striking A Balance\n\nConference we present the top five future indicators of sustainability,\n Number five\n Within fifteen years five percent of Alberta homes have solar\n\nshingles on their roofs and they'll be producing their own heat and power,\n Number four,\n In one decade ten percent of workers will leave the driving to the\n\ninternet and telecommute to work from their homes,\n Number three,\n After yard naturalization becomes a raging fad dandelions are no\n\nlonger scorned and dozens of species of songbirds and wildlife reappear in\n\nurban neighbourhoods,\n Number two,\n Within a decade more community cooperatives spring up to get small\n\ngrocery stores back in neighbourhoods\n As a consequence local food is better marketed and more people\n\nlearn the names of their neighbours\n And finally the top future indicator of sustainable development is\n\n<,,> Ottawa swears of greenhouse gas emitting tar sands projects and\n\nasphalt-friendly infrastructure programs\n Instead the feds encourage solar power, light rail transit,\n\nand the marketing of new sustainable technologies,\n That's it for this week's Ecofacts and Trends\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  Last week we began our series on culture and sustainable\n\ndevelopment with an interview with author and activist  Jim Hanley \n He was the architect of the campaign to protect South Moresby as a\n\nCanadian national park in the mid nineteen eighties\n\n\n  the environment   and rainforest people around the world\n in\n\nsoutheast Asia\n It's a culture that lives sustainably in one of the oldest\n\nrainforests on Earth\n they seem a happy and content people with\n\nenough leisure time to leave anyone in the western world aghast\n Jim\n\nHanley  about culture and sustainable development, \n In view of humanity's potential to dominate the Earth Albert\n\nEinstein's analysis seems rather pragmatic\n man has lost the capacity to foresee and\n\nforestall \n\n Western society seems to have developed some capacity to foresee\n\nthings\n The real question remains in the forestalling department\n It's perhaps why we in the so-called first world spend enormous\n\namounts of time navel gazing and searching within our market-based system for\n\nways of making our consumer lifestyle sustainable\n has spent time with cultures like the\n\nMentawai of  Seburoot  the Penan of Borneo and the Quechua of the\n\nAmazon\n Many of these cultures are already socially environmentally and\n\neconomically sustainable\n if there's anything western society\n\ncan learn about sustainability from other cultures\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  thinks we have to get beyond the recycling\n\nstage to take seriously more challenging concepts like reduction,\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  In our quest to develop new markets the western world\n\ncertainly seems to have become culturally imperialistic\n The western consumer lifestyle's intoxicating\n It's addictive\n it's endangering sustainable\n\ncultures and mowing down rainforests throughout southeast Asia\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  The unbridled economic development that's racing through\n\nsoutheast Asia today reminds  Hanley  of Canada in the nineteen\n\nfifties\n In this frenzy of economic development people are not sitting\n\naround debating sustainable development\n argues that many countries are actually\n\nmoving away from sustainability\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  One by one diverse and once sustainable cultures and\n\nrainforests are being swallowed in the name of economic development\n\n<$Z> \n\n<$A>  remains hopeful\n It will take creativity and he says some sacred notions will have\n\nto be shed along the way but there are solutions\n Some of which exist in other cultures\n Next week is

agriculture is being lost\n In addition ground water is being overpumped and aquifers are also\n\nbeing depleted in many countries,\n According to Postel no one has tallied the potential effect on\n\nfuture food production,\n It takes up to one thousand tonnes of water to grow one tonne of\n\ngrain\n No one is sure where a sustainable supply of water will come from\n\nin the future\n The number of large dams has climbed from five thousand in nineteen\n\nfifty to thirty-eight thousand today\n But this strategy has also had many environmental side effects\n As the demand for water intensifies many river deltas and coastal\n\nestuaries are losing their capacity to support fisheries\n The lower reaches of China\'s Yellow River have gone dry an average\n\nof seventy days a year in each of the last ten years\n The Aral Sea in central Asia has lost half its area and three\n\nfourths of its volume to cotton production,\n As a consequence twenty out of twenty-four fish species

Generally government rules dictate that all merchantable trees\n\nthat is those that are of a size and quality that can be sold must be removed\n\nfrom a cutblock\n Hence the clear-cuts\n So Al-Pac is

from sitting too much ,\n In eighteen ninety-one undaunted Clara Brett Martin presented a\n\nformal petition to the Law Society of Upper Canada for admission as a student\n\nat law\n This is the first record we have in Canada written record I\n\nemphasize that of a female applicant\n Which is not to suggest that there weren\'t women before her who\n\ndesired to go and who may have made informal enquiries\n This is our first written record\n The benchers of the Law Society rejected her application in the\n\nfirst of what would be a series of Law Society votes against her admission\n The Canada Law Journal put it succinctly\n\n It would take two separate statutes of the provincial parliament,\n\nlobby forces mounted by very very prominent women in the community such as\n\nEmily Stowe the first white woman doctor, and Lady Aberdeen the wife of\n\nthe Governor General and the founder of the National Council of Women of\n\nCanada and six more years before Clara Brett Martin would finally achieve\n\nsuccess\n During her articling experience she was described by fellow\n\nstudents as, a very odd sort of woman, a rebel, and in later years\n\nas a queer old duck\n She survived taunting hissing and classroom sexual harassment\n\nequivalent to that experienced by Emily Stowe one of the first women doctors\n She also survived unprecedented media attention\n Her first courtroom appearance was followed by a bevy of reporters\n\nconcerned above all with her appearance her voice inflection and her facial\n\ntone\n Now those of you, who\'ve appeared in court for your first time\n\nalready will know what it\'s like to walk into a courtroom,\n Can you imagine walking into that courtroom as the first woman,\n\nwith a hoard of newspaper reporters at your toes\n This is one of the reports that was written\n\n Clara Brett Martin went on to develop a successful practice\n\ncentring upon wills real estate and family law\n Women lawyers howl with laughter when they hear this because that\'s\n\nstill where women practice,\n She rarely went to court\n One is not surprised,\n She hired a number of female articling students\n lectures\n\nto women\'s organizations on issues of women and law\n She wrote extensively for the National Council of Women of Canada\n\ncriticizing the paternal rights in child custody the double standard of\n\nsexuality in law and the legal disabilities of married women\n She lobbied for female suffrage and for separate women\'s courts\n She was elected as a school trustee and she ran for the position of\n\nalderman in nineteen twenty,\n She died in nineteen twenty-three at the relatively young age of\n\nforty-nine of a heart attack,\n Now within the past year and a half we have had a monumental\n\ndiscovery because until this time all efforts to trace Clara Brett Marin\'s\n\ndiaries journals correspondence personal and business files have failed\n However within the past year and a half a P H D History student\n\nnamed Peter Sibenik who was researching files in the archives of the Ontario\n\nAttorney General going through countless letters received by the Ontario\n\nAttorney General in the early twentieth century came across a letter from\n\nClara Brett Martin\n Now this is one of the only surviving letters remaining from Clara\n\nBrett Martin\'s practice\n And this letter indicates that Clara Brett Martin may have been a\n\nproponent of sex equality but she was also capable of fairly ugly forms of\n\ndiscrimination\n The letter she wrote in nineteen fifteen to the Ontario Attorney\n\nGeneral accused Jewish realtors of transferring   \n\nproperty titles   improperly,\n I\'m going to quote two or three lines of this\n Anybody who\'d like to look at the full letter I have ah the full\n\ncontents of it with me which you can see after\n But the lines which capture the flavour went as follows\n,\n Now this is one letter, and one of the first, questions that\n\nI\'d been asked when I\'m making, this speech is, can we make any\n\nassessments on the basis of one letter\n And I think that\'s a difficult question to answer\n I think that it is safe to say that on the basis of this one letter\n\nwe can make an assessment that Clara Brett Martin was anti-Semitic,\n On the other hand, this past week, I received a\n\ncorrespondence from  Gladys Kroech  from the University of Toronto\n\nwhich suggests that it is difficult to be conclusive in the face of one\n\nletter\n And I\'d like to read to you from a letter which she sent me written\n\nto her by  Robert Gordon  and dated November twenty-eighth nineteen\n\nninety,\n I have been\n\nreading with some interest recent reports of Clara Brett Martin and certain\n\nanti-Semitic remarks which she reportedly made \n\n Now, we got first late-breaking news about a Jewish legal\n\nsecretary and bookkeeper,\n Now I think that alters our record somewhat, but not completely\n I don\'t think, memories positive memories from a Jewish\n\nsecretary and bookkeeper are going to completely override a clearly expressed\n\nform of anti-Semitism in a nineteen fifteen letter but I think it signals,\n\nvery importantly to us that matters of discimination are complicated, and\n\nthat people are not all one or the other\n None of us is free from discrimination and none of us is completely\n\nmalevolent and I think that sets the context for my remarks today,\n Canadian society and the legal profession was riddled with\n\nanti-Semitism throughout the nineteenth century and the early twentieth\n\ncentury\n In the first decade of the nineteenth century Ezekiel Hart a\n\nmerchant from the small Jewish community in Trois-Rivi&egrave;res was elected\n\ntwice to represent his riding in the Quebec Legislative Assembly\n Both times he was declared ineligible to sit because he was a Jew\n family\n\n  members a descendant of Ezekiel Hart who became the first Jewish\n\nlawyer called to the bar in the two Canadas  some years later,\n By the eighteen eighties and nineties pogroms in Russia and Romania\n\ncaused several thousand Jews to immigrate to Canada and incidents of bigotry\n\nbegan to increase\n Goldwin Smith who in the nineteenth century was the darling of the\n\nCanadian intelligentsia was characterized as an arch Jew-bater and bitter\n\nanti-Semite by the Jewish Times\n Writing in eighteen eighty Smith proclaimed that Jews were an\n\nabhorrent tribe anti-social and immoral\n Henri Bourassa the French Canadian parliamentarian defended the\n\nRussian pogroms of nineteen oh five arguing that Jews brought it on\n\nthemselves through deception and exploitation\n In nineteen hundred the Toronto Weekly Sun clamoured to prohibit\n\nimmigration of Polish Jews\n it wrote claiming that\n\nPolish Jews were corruptors of the community\n In nineteen oh four the Ottawa Free Press protested the immigration\n\nof Russian Jews a group it described as having  drained the miserable\n\npurses of careless Russian peasants through usury and extortion ,\n In the nineteen twenties and thirties vast sectors of the economy\n\nwere completely closed to Jews\n Banks insurance companies department stores universities and large\n\nindustrial corporations refused to hire Jews\n There were no Jewish judges, and most law firms, also refused\n\nto hire Jewish members\n could not find a job in nineteen thirty-seven\n\nwhen he returned to Toronto from Harvard Law School\n A brilliant legal scholar with two Master\'s degrees to his credit\n\nhe was consigned to write head notes for a law publisher at fifty cents a\n\nnote,\n Now the question you\'re going to be asking yourself is, is\n\nhistorical context an excuse\n Does it excuse Clara Brett Martin\'s letter to know that she was\n\nsurrounded by anti-Semitic rhetoric and bigotry,\n Is it possible to argue she was merely a product of racist\n\ndiscriminatory intolerant times\n Now the typical historical answer to this is yes,\n My answer is no,\n Class discrimination, anti-Semitism racism ableism heterosexism\n\nand other forms of bias have made the lives of many members of oppressed\n\ngroups an unmitigated hell\n Clara Brett Martin must have known that and if she didn\'t she\n\nshould have,\n Throughout these years in addition to the bigots there were people\n\nbattling discrimination\n Jews and other religious minority groups were demanding freedom of\n\nreligion and an end to religious racial and ethnic bigotry\n There were choices to be made,\n Clara Brett Martin chose to perpetrate some of the abuses not fight\n\n them \n To modernize, her choices must be viewed as tragic\n A woman of such insight who fought so valiantly against the forces\n\nof oppression in many aspects of her life who paid the price of ostracism\n\nridicule and undisguised hostility for her work reveals herself as partially\n\nriddled with bias in some other aspects of her beliefs and practices,\n Now to move to a modern perspective the present debate seems to\n\nfocus on how we today in contemporary times should respond to information\n\nrevealing tragic deficiencies in insight of the famous heroines of the past\n And I think the importance of this question cannot be\n\noveremphasized,\n And I offer my remarks today as the preliminary, beginnings of\n\nwhat must necessarily be a full and lengthy debate,\n I also want to speak briefly about my own status in offering these\n\nremarks as a non-Jew,\n To some degree my situation today reflecting on Clara Brett\n\nMartin\'s anti-Semitism reminds me of a situation of a man who comes to\n\naddress an audience on how to tackle difficult issues relating to the\n\noppression of women\n We\'ve had a lot of debate in Canada over the last number of months\n\n<,> on the concept of appropriation of voice, and who should speak, on\n\nthese issues\n And I must say I side squarely with the group that is worried about\n\nappropriation of voice in that, scholars researchers, advocates who do\n\nnot speak from personal experience make mistakes, and I believe that,\n\nJewish women in fact should take the lead in this debate as individuals who\n\nhave much deeper insight into anti-Semitism and its meaning than anything\n\nthat Gentiles can offer\n However many Jewish people have suggested to me that it is not\n\nenough for us to sit back and let them take the lead on these debates that\n\nindeed they want to hear our voices, in this matter\n impo\n\n   important   points to offer, and knowing that I\'m\n\ntaking the risk of missing essential elements in the argument and hoping that\n\nif I do, Jewish feminists will respond and we will all learn more,\n And I want to talk squarely about the concept of a heroine today\n\n<,> because I think the question we\'re grappling is what meaning significance\n\nand symbolism should we accord to women of the past,\n And it\'s very well captured to my mind in the label "\n\nheroine "\n Are these women heroines or not,\n And this question is going to expand well beyond Clara Brett Martin\n\nas more historical evidence comes to the fore, about Nellie McClung\'s\n\nactivity, siding with the uh committee of citizens the one thousand\n\ncitizens that attempted to strike break during the Winnipeg General Strike\n\n as more evidence of\n\nEmily Stowe the first white woman doctor\'s class insensitivities come to the\n\nfore\n Ya I mean even uh one of the most famous women from Quebec history\n\n<,>\n forget her name\n Marguerite, Bourgeoys, uh turns out to have been an active\n\nslave holder and uh marketer in slaves,\n I think that, as our society struggles towards a greater\n\nsensitivity to class and race and gender disparities we\'re going to learn\n\nmore about the mistakes of women we have

{'text': '<$A>  The Oxford dictionary speaks of illustrious warriors, of men\n\nadmired for their achievements and noble qualities,\n Searching for a female-centred definition I turned to Vogue magazine\n\n<,,> \n\n\ncrowd laugher \n In any event, Vogue magazine described heroines as infinitely\n\nalluring a shade tragic, \n Damsels in distress locked in castle turrets loom immediately before\n\nyour eyes\n I was rescued somewhat by the publication of feminist dictionaries\n\nover the last several years and the several that I cited poke fun, at\n\n" hero "\n My favourite was a recitation from Charlotte Perkins Gilman who was\n\na very famous American, feminist at the turn of the century who wrote as\n\nfollows\n This is her definition of " hero "\n\n Canadian Prime\n\nMinister , \n, what\'s most interesting to me about the\n\nfeminist dictionary is that it contained no entry for " heroine\n\n",\n Presumably some feminists have concluded that the female\n\ncounterpart of this " hero " is unsalvageable that it is\n\nseriously infected with saccharine femininity race and class privilege and\n\nthe glorification of characteristics prized by men\n\n\n respectfully   wish to disagree\n I have always been partial to the reclamation of words and I think\n\nthere is room to rehabilitate the word " heroine " \n\naltered  to give new meaning and dimension to the concept\n It is not beyond the realm of possibility to believe that the\n\nfeminist movement could forge an entirely new definition for "\n\nheroine ", one much richer fuller, and more reflective of the\n\ndiversity of women\'s lives\n I think we need to grope toward something which will capture the\n\nlives of women who represent strength, courage, persistence,\n\nfortitude, all of those, in the face of oppression\n And I think there\'re two main premises behind the reclamation task\n Let me just write this\n,\n sound of writing on a\n\nblackboard  is the concept of inclusivity\n Our understanding of the levels of oppression have to be as\n\ninclusive as possible so that we ensure that race class and sexual\n\norientation and so on are considered, as well as gender\n\n Secondly I think we have to, grapple with the male traditions\n\nwhich tout heroes as role models and as perfect\n I think we have to move beyond perfection,\n And I think we need to ask ourselves is perfection what feminists\n\nwant to demand of their foresisters\n Is perfection a necessary ingredient of female heroism,\n Let me start with the first inclusivity,\n Much of our current feminist historical scholarship, has focused\n\nupon white well-educated middle and upper class Protestant women\n For this I have to claim I share some responsibility\n I\'m clearly implicated in terms of the women that I began choosing\n\nto study\n In my defence and the defence of the rest of us I can say that\n\ntheir records tend to be more accessible and their achievements have tended\n\nto reflect in some measure the criteria that wider society has viewed as\n\nheroic,\n But it seems to me that the search for women who represent strength\n\nand courage and persistence and fortitude in the face of oppression should be\n\nmuch wider,\n And the realization of this was painfully brought home to me,\n\nwhen I, began working on my manuscript, which will be appearing this\n\nSpring titled Petticoats and Prejudice\n I know this is the second time the title\'s been mentioned\n I\'m shamelessly flaunting, my book,\n This is based on about a decade\'s worth of research I\'ve done on\n\nnineteenth century legal records\n And they reveal a remarkably diverse bunch of women, improperly\n\nmarried wives victims of seduction and rape perpetrators of infanticide and\n\nabortion practising prostitutes, petitioners for divorce and child custody\n\nand wage labourers\n None of these women are warriors active in military manoeuvres\n Furthermore the admiration they achieved from a paternalistic\n\nsociety was grudgingly qualified at best,\n Nor were they fainting damsels, rescued by handsome knights,\n And yet there\'s undeniable heroism in the lives of women such as\n\nthe following\n Ellen Rogers was a francophone rape victim who demanded that women\n\nof all classes and sexual background should be protected from sexual assault\n She spoke those words through tears, in a Toronto courtroom in\n\neighteen fifty-nine to a courtroom filled with jeering and abusive public\n\nmembers who were laughing and shouting as her gang rapists were acquitted\n\n<,,>\n was an English prostitute who ran a\n\nnotorious brothel in London Ontario in the eighteen eighties\n The Crown Attorney and the Mayor of London decided to conduct a\n\nlegal vendetta against her to make an example of her\n She hired\n She was a well-to-do brothel operator\n She hired the leading criminal lawyers in the country, a raft of\n\nthem\n About four by the time she finished\n And she fought them at every turn of the way\n And when she achieved success in her criminal, case she turned\n\naround and authorized her lawyers to sue the Crown Attorney and Mayor of\n\nLondon for compensation for false imprisonment\n She won, at the first level of hearings\n Subsequently the ruling was overturned but before they could catch\n\nup with her to jail her, she had fled to the United States\n And she returned to London approximately a decade later flush with\n\nprosperity, with a new husband in tow who was described as a horse breeder\n\nand horse dealer to live out her life in financial security and middle class\n\nrespectability in London Ontario,\n Euphemia Rabbit was a woman, from the First Nations who also had\n\nItalian ancestry who shot and killed her would-be rapist at Slate Creek\n\nBritish Columbia, in eighteen ninety-seven and she successfully argued\n\nself-defence at her murder trial,\n a Finnish immigrant committed infanticide in\n\nNanaimo in eighteen ninety-six in the face of stark poverty and social\n\nostracism and then withstood the dramatic legal intervention into her life\n\nwith stoicism and fortitude,\n Nellie Armstrong was a feisty smart-mouthed hot-tempered New\n\nBrunswicker who fought unsuccessfully in eighteen ninety-five to wrest\n\ncustody of her four year old daughter and two year old son from a violent\n\nhusband\n These women and others are ones whose histories should also be\n\nreclaimed and who also deserve the accolation " heroine "\n Next moving to perfection beyond perfection\n have\n\ntraditionally been catapulted into service for furnishing role models for the\n\ncurrent generation and women have borrowed this pattern and heroines have\n\nbeen forced into moulds as gurus touted as unblemished symbols of wisdom\n\ninsight and inspiration\n My colleague Rob Martin has charged me with inculcating adulation\n\nof Clara Brett Martin publicly\n I think fairly in some measure\n Fairly,\n And I think the time is overdue for us to re-examine the search for\n\nperfection and consider whether it is essential or fundamental to our\n\nemerging new concept of heroine\n These women did not ask to become our shining knights in armour,\n Most of them would be horrified to know to what degree their\n\nthoughts and deeds would be scrutinized by future generations\n Out of a feminist sense of charity perhaps we ought not to require\n\nwomen of the past to bear responsibility of icons of the future a role they\n\nnever sought,\n Femininism might want to work towards embodying a more humble sense\n\nof human error, a more grounded set of expectations about human failings\n\nand deficiencies\n We come by this naturally\n No one who has worked within the feminist movement for any length\n\nof time can claim innocence on this score,\n One of the gravest tasks facing our society today is to work\n\ntowards an elimination of continuing and vicious anti-Semitism racism ableism\n\nand other forms of discrimination,\n One of the chief barriers, is the inability of members of the\n\nprivileged groups in our society to admit their complicity\n The knee-jerk reactions of defensiveness which sprouts almost\n\nimmediately upon any assertion of sexism and racism is eloquent testimony to\n\nour wish to erase even the most polite dialogue, on these issues,\n One way we might speed the work against these barriers is to look\n\nto our past, to dissect the racism sexism and other forms of\n\ndiscrimination of our ancestors, to do this honestly and without\n\nattempting to distance ourselves artificially from their errors,\n Clara Brett Martin\'s failure to make feminism inclusive of all\n\nwomen\'s interests is centrally important to any full analysis of her place in\n\nhistory\n I think we can learn from her errors because in so many ways her\n\nerrors are our errors, and this whole debate is about ourselves and the\n\nfuture\n We can use the revelations about Clara Brett Martin\'s anti-Semitism\n\nas a spur to produce more research on the history of anti-Semitism and its\n\ncurrent manifestations on our profession and society\n We can make Clara Brett Martin\'s mistakes work to our heightened\n\nappreciation of justice fairness and equality\n We can turn her lack of insight into a mechanism for remedial\n\naction today\n Clara Brett Martin\'s principles and actions were marred by bigotry\n\nand limited perspective but she did fight against some forms of male\n\ninjustice\n She challenged a part of the patriarchal system and she paid\n\npersonally for her daring\n Demanding that she be perfect, that she have understood every\n\naspect of bigotry and injustice is to hold her to a model which will be met\n\nby very few, perhaps none,\n That vision of heroine as perfect and omniscient is binding\n\nrestrictive and remarkably rigid\n If we hold to it, we will consign ourselves to a future in which\n\nhistorians will write of theory, and institutions, but not of people\n I for one would rather historians continue to write about\n\nindividual women, detailing at length their shortcomings and yet according\n\nthem the respect of recognizing that at points there were bonds of shared\n\nsisterhood\n as a\n\nwoman   with significant gaps in her understanding of injustice and\n\ndiscrimination\n I think we need to ask ourselves whether there is still room for\n\nher within this evolving rehabilitated concept of " heroine\n\n"\n And I want to close with a poem by Adrienne Rich, called A Wild\n\nPatience Has Taken Me This Far\n\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  two words\n\n</unclear> describing this bizarre geography book called Gender and Sexuality\n After tracking down and reading Peter Jackson\'s Maps of Meaning

{'text': '<$A>  It has been argued that this development of feminist Geography\n\nparallels developments in other humanist geographic research such as Marxist\n\n<,> and,  phenomenological  studies,\n

them\n The debates among human geographers questioned the definition of\n\nGeography as a    solely   spatial science\n\nand reintroduced human environmental relations as essential concerns  of\n\nthe

the <unclear> word </unclear> number of women in the discipline\n\nhistorically\n the number of women involved in generating\n\nknowledge in a given discipline appears to be important in determining the\n\ndegree to which feminism is absorbed in  a specific academic  research\n\ninstitution \n As all knowledge is a social creation it reflects the conditions\n\nout of which it is produced and  transmitted \n\n\nwith men\'s knowledge and theory and <unclear> word </unclear> men who have\n\ndefined its focuses and interests have defined the fields the areas and the\n\nacceptable lines of

undergraduate levels men are predominant <unclear> maybe three words\n\n</unclear> especially on the physical side of the discipline\n And of the few female students who do enter the graduate levels the\n\nattrition level is high\n One study from the United States shows that feminist or female\n\ngraduate Geography students not necessarily feminists have <unclear> word\n\n</unclear> the highest

in Geography\n\n\nfemales  in Geography,\n related to the\n\nnature of the discipline of Geography which is inherently androcentric,\n\nand in sharp conflict with the nature of feminism\n maybe\n\ntwo words </unclear> has been a study of the <unclear> word </unclear> world\n\n<,,>\n Geography like any other discipline is a product of its times\n The origins of Western Geography penetrates back to the ancient\n\nGreeks in the fifth and fourth century B C, where the first \n\nphilosophers  the Ionians including <unclear> a few words </unclear> and\n\nso on first began to ask questions with the shape and origin of the Earth\n It\'s interesting that the first philosophy which emerged from the\n\nWest was the philosophy of nature,\n Their aim was to create a man-made philosophy which could explain\n\nand control the  whims and irrationality  of nature <unclear> word\n\n</unclear>,\n Women were excluded from the ranks of these philosophers and\n\n<unclear> phrase </unclear>\n Although Geography is currently divided into the human Geography\n\nand physical Geography the emergence of Geography initially from a physical\n\nscience that is    or Geology   uh the study\n\nof the Earth\'s surface is significant,\n This may partially explain why Geography has traditionally been\n\nmore male-dominated than other social sciences as hard physical sciences have\n\nhistorically been seen as a male endeavour and it may partially explain why\n\nit traditionally  stresses  the landscape a landscape which is formed\n\nand  interpreted  by the male gaze,\n described this role of the male\n\ngaze in shaping the landscape\n word\n\n</unclear> in the United States personified in the female body in overtly\n\nsexual terms,\n The association that was prevalent in ancient Greece of women with\n\nthe private sphere and men with the public has continued in Western  minds\n\n,\n As geographers throughout history have traditionally been men it is\n\nunderstandable how Geography    has focused\n\npredominantly   on public that is male spaces\n places on the\n\nEarth where we could see the greatest interaction between man and his\n\nenvironment such as the ancient Greek    agora  \n\nor in contemporary urban areas it is evident that in these places they have\n\nbeen constructed by and for men,\n As women have been associated with private spaces they have\n\nrelatively little opportunity to modify the landscape traditionally studied\n\nby geographers\n geographers unlike sociologists\n\nusually exclude the small scale and the <unclear> word </unclear> for\n\nconsideration ignoring the material world the social and spatial\n\nrelationships that take place within buildings ,\n\n example of urban\n\nGeography    which has   traditionally\n\nconsidered the production of the built environment the distribution of the\n\nurban space how households gain access to certain types of housing in\n\nparticular parts of towns and cities but they stop at the front door, and\n\nthey ignore questions about the sexual division of labour within the home or\n\nthe structural <unclear> word </unclear> relations within the households\n Thus Geography\'s emphasis on large scale and macro processes\n\nprovides another reason for the degree to which Geography has remained\n\nremarkably untouched by feminist theory,\n\n\n might consider the <unclear> word </unclear>, uh of interiors as\n\nexpressions of a culture reflecting women\'s activities but, it is\n\nimportant to, realize that this women\'s culture is <unclear> word\n\n</unclear> in a predominantly male architecture and design\n In this paper I\'ve attempted to understand the reasons behind\n\nGeography\'s reluctance to adopt feminist insights as this will provide a\n\nstronger vantage point from which to    tackle \n\n its historically androcentric nature,\n word\n\n</unclear> to Geography and why feminist Geography and insights    of   feminist theory in general are so little known by\n\ngeographers\n Feminist Geography provides a direct challenge to this\n\nandrocentricity\n admit the gender bias of traditional geographic\n\ntheory and to transform radically the structure of our knowledge of reality\n\nand our obsession  of states of things \n This discussion also contributes to the current debate of whether\n\nfeminist theory and researching should be added as one thread among many\n\nwithin human Geography or whether a feminist perspective might be developed\n\nwithin all the subdivisions of human Geography,\n\n\nnow as fitting into Helene Cixous\'s framework of binary oppositions, where\n\nfeminist Geography is in an unprivileged position to traditional that is\n\nnon-feminist Geography,\n\n\nas a solution to male discourse would have undoubtedly argued that feminist\n\nGeography should remain as a separate  endeavour \n argues that feminist Geography as a separate\n\nspecialist course on feminist Geography would combat continuing sexism and\n\nencourage female students to  sit in  the academic environment,\n a\n\npractical challenge to the male-dominated <unclear> a few words </unclear> of\n\nacademia since as  Morgan    Hanson   \n\nhas argued  the more women are involved in the dissemination of\n\nknowledge the greater degree to which feminism is likely to be appropriated\n\n<unclear> word </unclear> research processes ,\n But an integrationist approach would also combat sexism and it\n\nwould also encourage more women to go into Geography\n I argue that the inherently androcentric nature of Geography\n\nindicates that it is vital for Geography to wholeheartedly adopt feminist \n\n  insights   within all of human Geography\n If feminist Geography remains as a separate and marginalized\n\nsubdiscipline it will present a weaker challenge to the highly androcentric\n\nnature of Geography\n Thus I advocate a feminist perspective within all streams of human\n\nGeography as feminism has the potential to radically transform the

spontaneous reading by a\n\ngroup of subjects would be the same as that conducted by the same readers who\n\nhad had time to read and think about the text\n Here are the results,\n Spontaneous versus non-spontaneous\n When I compared the analysis of those who noted down their\n\ninterpretations as they were reading the text with those produced by students\n\nhaving had time to study the text I noted areas of agreement, within and\n\nbetween both groups\n Spontaneous reactions to a text can be held in common and can be\n\nmaintained over time\n\n\ninconsistencies   <unclear> two words </unclear> with spontaneous\n\nreading\n Over time a few readers also changed their minds as to the meaning\n\nof a text,\n of the two\n\ndependent   variables subjects opponents time led to more coherent\n\nreadings of the text\n When designating objects and convergences those who had more time\n\nthat is the non-spontaneous readers entered more responses than did the\n\nspontaneous group\n For example the non-spontaneous group supplied more objects and\n\nmore convergences than did the spontaneous group\n Conclusion,\n And of course this is all very summarized form\n Time makes a difference\n Not surprising\n It leads readers to change their minds about the meanings of a text\n\nto produce more consistent analysis of what they have read and to propose\n\nmore varied and more nuanced analysis\n I'm going to go to what you have as uhm, four point three,\n\ninstead of four point two for the first and I'll go back to four point two\n Critical expertise overall knowledge,\n When comparisons against the overall knowledge levels of the\n\nreading subjects were conducted a complex pattern was revealed of overlap and\n\nagreement coupled with opposing nuances and outright contradictions\n On the one hand informed readers agree on several points with\n\nnon-informed readers\n That is there were some commonly held perceptions\n On the other hand those who were most informed selected a larger\n\nnumber of types of objects and convergences than did the less informed group\n\nwhere choices were more spread out and basically less consistent within the\n\ngroup\n Conclusion\n Informed readers and non-informed readers disagree as to the\n\nrelative importance of the different types of possible answers\n The concepts of those with high levels of overall knowledge are\n\nmore differentiated, their readings more nuanced than those of the less\n\ninformed readers\n To put it another way the more you know the more you have to say\n\n<,>\n This is certainly a reassuring conclusion for those of us who make\n\na living from having a lot to say and saying it in such a way as to imply \n\n  that we   are revealing new truths to those\n\nwho may be listening\n But more significantly it points to the importance of overall\n\ndomain-related knowledge and the differentiation of expert and non-expert\n\nreaders\n Now we'll go to specifics\n Critical expertise knowledge of the critical model,\n When I compared the work of readers who were not instructed as to\n\nthe use of the actual critical model with that of well-instructed readers\n\nresults showed that there was generally no consistent pattern of response\n\nwithin the non-   instructed   group\n Moreover by none of my measures did the non-instructed group agree\n\nwith the instructed group\n For example readers with high levels of this type of domain\n\nknowledge designated subjects and opponents more often and more logically\n\nthan did those with little knowledge of the model\n In the same way subjects with high levels of domain knowledge also\n\ndesignated more objects and more convergences    than\n\ndid   those with low levels of knowledge of the critical model,\n Conclusion\n Knowledge of the process seems to make a difference both as a\n\ndistinguishing factor between experts and non-experts and as a means of\n\ndifferentiating experts from each other\n Knowledge of the critical methodology distinguishes readers from\n\neach other\n It is also sufficient condition to allow readers to produce more\n\nlevels of meaning\n In this case more convergences than objects,\n Critical expertise knowledge of theatre and or dramatic criticism\n The comparison of those with high levels of knowledge and or\n\ndramatic criticism and those with low levels of this type of critical\n\nexpertise produce interesting results which correlate with the finding for\n\nmeasures of overall knowledge\n Informed readers agreed in some points identified by non-informed\n\nreaders\n Informed readers generally analyze texts differently than do\n\nnon-informed readers\n Answers in the low level group differed by as much as fifty percent\n\nby those of the high level group\n Informed readers isolate more elements of meaning than do\n\nnon-informed readers and perhaps consequently informed readers disagree more\n\nbetween themselves than do non-informed readers,\n Conclusion\n Knowledge of the genre makes a difference\n It differentiates informed and non-informed readers and informed\n\nreaders against themselves\n There can be some agreement between the two groups but overall\n\nthose with relevant domain knowledge performed differently than those without\n\nthis type of knowledge\n Domain specific critical expertise is what differentiates expert\n\nreaders from non-expert readers and from each other\n At least, one might think that until we get to a knowledge of\n\nsemiotics another kind of expertise\n Perhaps the most surprising result of my research was that produced\n\nby the comparison between those  possessing  semiotic knowledge with\n\nthose with low levels of this particular type of critical expertise\n One could have expected these readers to behave as expert readers\n\nthat is to reply differently than the non-expert group and to provide more\n\nlayers of meaning\n But this is not what I found\n Responses were essentially the same for both groups\n The high knowledge group\n leave now,\n The high knowledge group designated about as many objects as did\n\nthe low knowledge group and both groups selected ah almost the same number of\n\nconvergences\n Conclusion,\n informed about\n\nliterature or literary theory in general is not a significant factor when\n\nanalyzing a specific genre or using a specific methodology\n Knowing about literary theory does not allow readers to produce\n\nmore detailed analysis or different readings than those of non-informed\n\nreaders\n Expert knowledge of theatre and dramatic criticism is what is\n\nrequired to differentiate literary critics of drama from non-expert readers\n Knowledge about semiotics apparently only generally relates to the\n\nspecific application of the Greimasian model to theatre and is therefore not\n\nenough to differentiate these critics from non-experts,\n Cultural expertise knowledge of Canada or Quebec,\n Although Canadians and Quebecois experts offered more levels of\n\nmeaning than a non-informed    group   those\n\nwith high levels of knowledge about Canada or Quebec did not differ amongst\n\nthemselves as to the meaning of the different types of analysis\n Moreover whether they knew about Canada or about Quebec these\n\nreaders distinguished themselves from those who knew less about Canada or\n\nQuebec by proposing far more objects and far more convergences\n Conclusion,\n Cultural expertise leads readers to form more numerous and more\n\nconsistent opinions on the meaning of a text related to the culture about\n\nwhich they are knowledgeable,\n national or\n\nregional  , interpretations of national or regional literatures\n\n \n Readers with knowledge of the culture to which the text is related\n\nproduce more meanings than less informed readers do, but more consistent\n\nand fewer than the other texts <unclear> maybe three words </unclear>\n Critical and cultural expertise knowledge of Quebec theatre\n Quebec theatre as opposed to theatres just by itself\n maybe two\n\nwords </unclear> produced complex and surprising results\n There was some agreement between the two groups although the\n\ninformed group produced more answers than did the non-informed group\n However when compared with those knowledgeable about Canada or\n\nQuebec this high knowledge group that is readers with high    levels \n\n of cultural and critical expertise designated fewer objects and\n\nconvergences than did the culturally aware group\n This implies yet again that there is a fine line to be drawn\n\nbetween different types and levels of expertise and there might even be a\n\ntype of expertise such as the case here which    lead \n\n readers to draw more concise and succinct conclusions than will not more\n\nna&iuml;ve readers do\n Conclusion\n As with the high cultural, knowledge group readers with high\n\nlevels of knowledge about the culture and the genre did not differ much\n\nwithin their own group, although their responses differed in number and\n\nkind from the low level group", 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': '<$A>  High levels of either dramatic critical knowledge or overall\n\ndomain knowledge differentiate readers from those with little or no relevant\n\n<,> domain knowledge\n If you know about the relevant culture and if you are an expert in\n\nthe particular genre the text relates to then your reading of the text will\n\nbe different from those without your double level of expertise\n On the other hand however cultural and critical expertise together\n\ndoes not necessarily lead to more numerous explanations than emanate from\n\nreaders with high levels of other types of domain knowledge\n Overall results,\n Taken as a whole\n\n\nabout three words </unclear>\n Taken as a whole all of these comparisons indicate that experts read\n\ndifferently than non-experts do\n Hypothesis number one\n They also show that experts read more into a text than do\n\nnon-experts\n Hypothesis number two\n And that knowledge of the relevant culture differentiates readers\n Hypothesis three\n Hypothesis four\n Commonly held ways of reading among experts has not been neatly\n\nproven, however\n my study produced the finding that expert\n\nreadings must have specific domain knowledge in order to distinguish\n\nthemselves as a group from non-experts\n Belonging to the same group of experts on theory is not enough to\n\ndifferentiate one group of readers from another\n So if you take all the semioticians in the room you will not answer\n\nas a  whole \n Sorry folks\n Okay\n Discussion\n These conclusions are consistent with other studies reported on in\n\nmy book and with experiments conducted by   \n\ncognitive   scientists on non-literary texts,\n To illustrate the latter point let me cite the example of the work\n\nof  Dane Bosch \n used\n\naccounts   of a fictitious baseball game to study the difference\n\nbetween what baseball experts learn and retain when reading, and what \n\n , non baseball experts   learned\n\nand retained from the same text\n found that high knowledge subjects reported larger\n\nchunks of information and recalled more propositions than did low knowledge\n\nsubjects\n\n\n  graphically   and with more variety than\n\ndid the low knowledge group\n full-scale\n\nstudy   full-scale study   about knowledge levels and reading\n\nrecall of a non-literary text could very well be applied to what I have found\n\nwhen studying the reception of a literary text\n According to both these studies domain-related concepts of the high\n\nknowledge individual are more differentiated than the concepts of the    low knowledge   individual\n Furthermore high knowledge individuals have a much greater\n\nknowledge of contingent relations and are more adept at using this knowledge\n\nthan are those with low domain knowledge\n In general then those who read either non-literary or literary\n\ntexts reveal similar patterns of reading and understanding\n There are commonly held concepts and ways of reading within and\n\nbetween different groups of readers\n There is a difference between the perceptions of nine na&iuml;ve\n\nreaders and those of    literary experts \n\n\n Literary critics as do other informed readers read differently than\n\ndo non-informed readers\n My empirical research into reader response has provided some useful\n\ninsights into the role of interpretive strategies, the significance of\n\ncritical knowledge domain specific critical expertise and the role of culture\n\nin the reading process\n It also points to answers some of the questions I first posed in\n\nnineteen eighty-nine in an article that appeared in  Linguika  called\n\n The Reader as Expert \n And if you look at the book summary you\'ll see that I have the last\n\nchapter is called  The Reader as Expert Part Two \n\n\nthat article   that appeared in nineteen eighty-nine\n Literary critics do have expertise that distinguishes them from\n\nnon-critics\n Literary critics tend to respond consistently as a group and\n\ntherefore have expertise that is not idiosyncratic\n Literary critics pick up the same text markers that other readers\n\ndo but they do so more frequently and more consistently than do na&iuml;ve\n\nreaders\n But, colleagues beware\n These results should be considered tentative and incomplete\n My samples were relatively small and there are many interesting\n\ncalculations and cross-calculations which could only have been    determined   from a very   \n\nlarge   scale study\n Studies of the kind I conducted might very well need to be\n\ncompletely redesigned should new critical models and different testing\n\nmethods emerge\n With time and further research we will also learn to pose other\n\nquestions\n To what degree for example do informed readers propose answers\n\nwhich are probably accurate or likely to be believed as opposed to those\n\nspontaneously arrived at\n Do critics behave more often as problem solvers than as expert\n\nreaders,\n Does a change of context in a text make a difference to the use of\n\nreading strategies\n So many questions\n So few answers\n In the context of reader response to literature and the performance\n\nof critics as experts, the eye of the beholder holds and contemplates many\n\nmysteries yet to be solved\n\n\n\n\n<$A>  The geography of women is really just a first step, though\n\na necessary one because the real problem  about  incorporating women\n\ninto geography  lies  not with <unclear> word </unclear> empirical\n\nresearch but  at the  theoretical and analytical level,\n The copious quantities of new descriptive and empirical material on\n\nwomen had been collected using traditional geographic <unclear> word\n\n</unclear> assumptions methodologies and paradigms\n In the early nineteen eighties it became apparent that in order to\n\nanalyze this new content women a new analytical framework feminism was needed\n\n<,>\n Feminist geography is therefore faced with the much larger task of\n\nreworking and redefining geographic theory,\n So what is feminist geography,\n Just as there isn\'t one definition of " feminism "\n\nor  even  " geography " there is also no one\n\ndefinition of the intersection of these two things,\n feminist geography as a study which explores\n\ndynamic interrelations between space and gender,\n\n\nways  and extents to which women and

are\n\ncultural constructs, but they\'ve never considered the ways in which gender\n\nis involved in this process,\n The geography of women is a necessary precursor for the entrance of\n\nfeminist

list\n\nof titles culled from the various learned sessions that started with    Roman   latrines and worked through I don\'t\n\nknow sewage systems or something mine was the ultimate wacky topic at the\n\nvery end    and   Professor  Lincolnshire\n\nReef  is working on gender panic and aesthetically enhanced subjects in\n\ncyberpunk\n only really good\n\nbenefit to come out of it was that uh I was elevated to full professor which\n\nis quite a jump     from \n\n graduate student so,\n At least\n Maybe the English Department hasn\'t found out yet though\n I\'m expecting the cheque so\n Uhm, there\'s an irony to that as well to this idea that uh the\n\npaper for all that it has this kind of esoteric uh topic matter or title uhm\n\nis actually dealing with a form and a subgenre that is very popular\n Uhm the novel I\'ll be speaking of principally today Neuromancer by\n\nWilliam Gibson at last look had gone through about fifteen editions has\n\nspawned an entire subgenre of material\n There are cyberpunk films that are watched by, the populous at\n\nlarge\n\n\n or   Blade Runner\n attached to it\n There\'s almost a lifestyle that\'s become attached to it\n that\n\n  is extremely populist uh    and  \n\nnot particularly esoteric\n At least perhaps not as esoteric as Roman latrines,\n So from beginning from that irony let me begin\n We are approaching the asyntotic limit of gender,\n Not the collapse of sexual difference but the ever-receding point\n\nat which differences verge on but    do   not\n\nbecome self-identical,\n In the information age the body and the irregular formations of\n\ngender which accrete about it are effaced become bits of data with no greater\n\nepistemological charge than any other bit of data circulating through our\n\nmodems and microprocessors\n Homo datum retains only the irreducible trace, of gender\n People hooked into the network of databases electronic uhm bulletin\n\nboards and mailboxes exist as identities free of reference to their bodies\n Computer hackers indulge in the opportunity to leave behind the\n\nmeat of their physical form and sing the body electric\n In the Net no one can tell if you\'re black or white male or female\n\nyoung or old oppositions which have a declining relevance once freed of the\n\nimperium of the gaze,\n Well the technology of gene splicing and virtual reality software\n\ntend towards its eclipse much recent feminist critical theory has been\n\nconcerned with the role of gender in the construction of gender and identity\n Teresa de Laurentis for example reconfigures Foucault\'s analysis of\n\nthe technology of sexuality to include the problem of sexual difference,\n\nconcluding that gender is quote  the product and the process of a\n\nnumber of social technologies of technosocial or biomedical apparati \n Donna Haraway\'s well-known essay A Manifesto for Cyborgs however\n\nperceives the emancipatory potential of the new technologies\n In a self-consciously ironic move geared to disconcert those who\n\nwould pledge allegiance in however mediated a sense, to the goddess of a\n\nnatural femininity\n Haraway embraces the figure of the cyborg, the assemblage of the\n\n   organic   and the inorganic of human\n\nconsciousness and machine agency which blurs the notion of a unitary\n\nautonomous and self-aware subject\n\n skips the step of original unity of identification\n\nwith nature and thus has no  trouble  with bisexuality pre-oedipal\n\nsymbiosis unalienated labour or other seductions to organic wholeness\n\n\n Cyborgs of course are not simply the products of a technosocial or\n\nbiomedical apparati\n They are creations of imagination particularly women\'s fiction,\n The monster of Mary Shelley\'s Frankenstein eighteen eighteen but\n\nnot strictly speaking a cyborg, remains the most resonant myth of\n\ntechnology\'s illegitimate offspring the creature that is not human yet is not\n\nanimal or machine,\n Frankenstien is also considered by many to be the first true\n\nscience fiction story and it is not surprisingly science fiction that has\n\nbeen one of the most effective literary forms for drawing into question and\n\nproblematizing the oppositions of mind body organism machine developed\n\nprimitive and man woman,\n Cyberpunk the most recent aesthetic revolution in science fiction\n\nis as its hybrid tag indicates particularly concerned with the breakdown\n\nbetween the human and the machine that has been the hallmark of late\n\ntwentieth century post-industrial capitalism,\n The term " cyberpunk " signifies less a set of,\n\nshared formal and aesthetic devices or even social and political concerns,\n\nso much as it does a range of literary styles and themes which only\n\noccasionally overlap\n Its arrival as a full grown movement, was announced by the\n\nfurore of critical accolades and prizes for William Gibson\'s first novel\n\nNeuromancer which came out in nineteen eighty-four, and then by    Bruce Sterling\'s   manifesto-like preface\n\nto a cyberpunk anthology entitled Mirrorshades which came out in nineteen\n\neighty-eight\n In this preface Sterling notes two recurrent sources of\n\nfascination in cyberpunk\n And this will give you some sense of the kind of topic matter that\n\nthe subgenre deals with\n the theme of body invasion, prosthetic\n\nlimbs implanted circuitry cosmetic surgery genetic alteration \n\n\n\ncyber, punk  shares with postmodernism and feminism and the form\'s\n\nacute awareness being wrought by advanced computer technology, allows it\n\nto

{'text': '<$A>  console that\'s a brand name and the\n\nnovel is littered with brand names, is a kind of prosthetic extension of\n\nhis mind which allows him to transcend his body and interface with a higher\n\nreality\n As the novel opens Case is pursuing a path of self-destruction\n Caught holding back on a client his nervous system has been\n\nsabotaged so that he can no longer enter the matrix that is so dear to him\n\n<,,>\n Though it does not effect him otherwise the nerve damage consigns\n\nthe cowboy to a kind of death in life\n He\'s like the cowboy who can\'t shoot his gun anymore\n a\n\ncorruption which like atoms leaves him in  quote  the prison\n\nof his own flesh  at the mercy of quote  the meat and all it\n\nwants , a real disdain for the physical form   \n\nand   what it needs    uh to survive\n\n \n The computer prosthesis effaces the body relegates it to an archaic\n\nand vulnerable support system which requires an unfortunate amount of\n\nmaintenance\n For homo datum biology is no longer the determining factor in\n\ndestiny but the hardware attached to it\n Upon Case\'s regaining the ability to enter the matrix the reader is\n\ntold  this was it \n,\n The prosthetic supplement is not just the means of access to the\n\ntranscendental realm of cyberspace but the apparatus of its domination,\n The matrix is the new frontier of the postindustrial psyche a\n\nterrain so vast as to never exhaust the imperialist  qua \n\ncapitalist desire for expansion and exploitation\n The relationship between Case the console cowboy and the space\n\nwhich is the proving ground of his identity is a remarkably accurate\n\nremapping of the politics of domination so evident in the imperialist\n\nenterprise\n Though as Hollinger claims Neuromancer in many ways aligns the\n\nstructural oppositions that have supported the phallocentric project of\n\ncapital, the text also encodes a disturbing desire to witness the male\n\nsubject mastering a threateningly feminine nature which is at once greater\n\nand lesser than he,\n The transition, from the world of meat our physical forms to\n\nthat of cyberspace the word that is used to describe this is "\n\njacking in "\n One jacks in to the matrix\n The act is thus explicitly sexual\n The term derives from hardware installation which a male plug or\n\njack, is inserted into a female receptacle\n It also carries with it particularly in light of the solitary and\n\nrhapsodic nature of the act connotations of masturbation\n " Jacking off " is a euphemism for "\n\nmasturbation ",\n The descriptions of Case moving through cyberspace consistently\n\ndisplay attitudes of male aggression\n programs\n\nto bore holes in  heights  of secure databases and most commonly\n\npunches through the colour-coded spheres of information\n Particularly he punches\n Spends most of his time punching things I guess from punching a\n\nkeyboard,\n a\n\nterm resonant with echoes of Freud\'s description of female sexuality as\n\nlacuna as a dark continent a non-space of lack and absence\n The principle site of male gender panic however is displaced from\n\ncyberspace, to the prosthetically enhanced woman Molly,\n is a\n\ndisplacement of   male anxiety surrounding Molly to cyberspace,\n Molly is a razor girl\n She\'s a hired muscle that plies her trade with the aid of uh a\n\nmirrored visor grafted into her skull through which she can receive uh\n\ninformation from computer chips implanted in the nervous system\n She has these kinds of sunglasses that on the inside of she can\n\nreceive information\n Uhm her body has been uhm prosthetically enhanced so that her\n\nnervous system is jacked up so that she can respond very quickly to things\n\n<,>\n More importantly though, and more menacing Molly\'s had scalpel\n\nblades surgically inserted under her red painted fingernails\n\n\nvagina dentata  the archetypal image of male castration anxiety\n The threat Molly represents to the male characters is aptly summed\n\nup by one who warns another  she\'d have you wearing your balls for a\n\nbowtie if you looked at her cross-eyed ,\n Another character Peter Riviera who is capable of projecting\n\nholographic images\n He has computer implants which allow him to project three\n\ndimensional projections of his imagination,\n He performs a cabaret piece in which a phantasmal version of\n\nhimself is shown constructing an idealized Molly out of thin air\n The performance concludes with the phantom Molly extracting her\n\nrazorblades and ripping her creator apparent\n The full significance of Riviera\'s holographic vignette does not\n\nbecome fully apparent until much later in the book when Molly perhaps fearing\n\ndeath uncharacteristically reveals something of her past to Case\n And now it gets very odd\n a kind of\n\n   prostitute  \n This is what Molly was\n chip\n\n  chip   implanted in her nervous system which allows her to\n\ndissociate herself from what\'s going on\n throws a switch\n\nin her mind and she sort of literally jacks out of her body which then\n\nproceeds to go through the actions with whatever her clientele is and then\n\nwhen the act is all over she can come back into her consciousness,\n Molly uses the money earned as a meat puppet to fund the expensive\n\nsurgery required to outfit her as a razor girl\n\n\nfor this   uh these   new glasses and stuff\n\n\n  some customer software   cooked up\n\n\n He essentially reprograms her body in order to take advantage of\n\nher special physical characteristics\n Her boss figures well she\'s got these scalpel blades\n\n\nclientele that might get off on that\n Perhaps I can take advantage of this,\n I never knew who wrote the program they switched me to\n\n says Molly  but it was based on all the classics \n She thus becomes an expression not only of male financial\n\nexploitation of women but an entirely male literary tradition of pornography\n But the classics that Molly refers to can only be the works of de\n\nSade and Masoch\n One night the cut-out chip that shields her conscious mind fails\n\nand Molly discovers herself in the middle of a routine with a customer\n This is not for the squeamish\n\n\n\n a threesome and what the senator wanted was for her to dismember    the   other woman    in this \n\n  ménage &agrave; trois \n At the end of it when Molly jacks back in when her microchip fails\n\nand she realizes what she\'s done    she   similarly\n\nprobably dismembers the senator\n,\n Molly becomes, a complexly overdetermined character of male\n\nanxiety\n More than just the fear concomitant with the figure\n\nof the independent autonomous assertive woman she represents the erosion of\n\nmale power as the return of the repressed\n Riviera\'s performance the one where he constructs her out of air\n\nand then she destroys him, shows her as the product of male power\n He literally constructs her\n\n\nof that power\n She rips him apart\n The seeds of its own destruction\n Molly\'s days as a meat puppet rewrites the gender panic she\n\ninspires as the just and final comeuppance of the exploitation of women in\n\npatriarchy\n The readily apparent sexual anxiety which surrounds Molly spills\n\nover into the already feminized realm of cyberspace dangerously destabilizing\n\nit as a proving ground of the new male power base\n The relationship between the matrix and Molly recalls the lack\n\nwhich the prosthetic device serves to disguise,\n When Case first makes love with Molly he experiences the act as a\n\nsubstitute for jacking in to the matrix,\n This is the passage\n\n This scene reverses the comforting male dominance of the act of\n\njacking in\n Here the female receptacle has literally the upper hand as Molly\n\nusurps the assertive role\n Significantly however Molly\'s orgasm goes undescribed\n The male dominated point of view seeks to deny to suppress and\n\nmaster the condition of lack lack of power lack of body to which the very\n\nfact of prosthesis attests\n A body which requires supplementation is always already the site of\n\nloss\n The narrative voice that is ensconced in Case\'s subjectivity\n\nhowever can only see Molly as impaling herself a description fraught with the\n\nmale desire for mastery in the face of its painfully inferior position\n displaces her entirely in the\n\nvastness of the space for which she only serves as a metaphor    uh subsumes her otherness   into\n\nthe realm over which he as an ace console  jackie  has complete\n\ncontrol\n The effacement of difference sketched in this scene from early in\n\nthe book reproduces a miniature of the narratological movement of the novel\n\n\nstim   stimulation   rig a device implanted in Molly\'s nervous\n\nsystem that allow Case to interface with her through his computer\n Case literally uses her as his eyes so that she moves around\n\nthrough things and he can control her\n see through her\n Molly becomes an extension of

of my life, whom I had certainly never\n\nforgotten showed me the, official Province of Saskatchewan Department of\n\nEducation daily register for recording the attendance of pupils which she had\n\nkept that year when she was seventeen years old when after six weeks of\n\nprofessional training in Saskatoon she had come to  Treadwell  on\n\nOctober the nineteenth nineteen forty-two as a certified, student teacher\n\nwith a salary of eight hundred dollars per year prorated of course because\n\nshe started   , at   the end of October, \n\n\n\n<$A>  And as I grew older I listened to sermons more closely I\n\nrealized that all this magnificent talk about bible stories\n The Mennonite church I grew up in had only two art forms\n harmonized singing\n\n,\n All of this varied preaching could only mean that there was some\n\ndebate about what the Bible meant and said in some places,\n And then my mother made a fatal error,\n To balance all the made up books I was obviously reading in school\n\n<,> she bought a book for me, from a traveling salesman I think\n Now how and with what kind of vehicle this man it could not have\n\nbeen a woman got beyond all the gravel roads in Saskatchewan there wasn\'t a\n\nmile of pavement in it at the time to this last dirt wagon track that ended\n\nonce and for all at our bush place I don\'t know\n If I ever write a story about him I expect it to sound something\n\nlike Flannery O\'Connor even though no one in our family has ever needed a\n\nwooden leg,\n There it was a very thick book one I did not have to carry back to\n\nschool the seven hundred and fifty-seven hardcover pages of Hulbert\'s Story\n\nof the Bible\n the complete Bible story running\n\nfrom Genesis to Revelation told in the simple language of today for young and\n\nold \n,\n A year ago in a used bookstore I found a salesman edition of this\n\nbook\n you should try to sell the two\n\ndollar and fifty cent edition with gold and ink stamping plain edges whenever\n\nyou can \n\n often wonder if\n\nyou have to tell salesmen that I mean, they must be pretty slow somewhere\n\nbut\n,\n\nbought the ink stamped only in blue cloth plain edges for a dollar fifty,\n First the continuous stories of the pictures and then that expanded\n\ninto the tempting evocative  condensious  and nevertheless endlessly\n\nexpansive stories of the words\n I devoured that book for years\n Its very large size was very useful as well\n For years my mother did not understand how fast I could read and\n\nwhen she called up the stairs for me to get down here and do something useful\n\nI could always shove whatever book I had under the bedclothes and yell back\n\nI\'m reading the Bible book and at least stop her lecture on <unclear> two\n\nwords </unclear> junk\n When look at that book now I realize that despite several years of\n\nbiblical studies at colleges and universities much of my fundamental image of\n\nthe Hebrews, in their strange desert world and of course I\'ve never seen a\n\ndesert, remains based on Hulbert and the pictures in Hulbert\n And so, despite what I knew about the absolute truth of the\n\nBible, an emotional conviction that I would never be able to unsettle from\n\nthe depths of my as the Hebrew scriptures have it my   splochna\n\n  my most innermost bowels\n Nevertheless I read the Bible stories pretty much as I read the\n\nGreek myths in the tiny blue books out of the  Treadwell  school\n\nlibrary\n Schools that I\'ve never yet been able to find anywhere either in\n\nlibraries or in used book stores\n Books which offered the stories of Jason of Theseus, of Owl Grey\n\nwise Athena of Medina with her dreadful tempting hair of Odysseus scrabbling\n\nwith pigs and one-eyed giants and the wrath of Achilles and the stupefying\n\nbeauty of Helen of Procrustes with his terribly strange bed that never fitted\n\nanyone of Venus riding her shell up on the ocean\'s foam\n I had never seen an ocean, but the thunderstorm smashing the\n\nwater on  \n\n Turtle Lake   against Indian Point filled me with awe and dread\n Of fleeces with golden sheep and minotaurs and flying too close to\n\nthe sun and falling falling smashing into the sea but, incredibly lifted\n\nup poised    on the snouts   of dolphins\n What were dolphins\n And the slender woman running into the transformation of a delicate\n\n branchy  tree like the thousands of poplars or birch or willows or\n\nspruce or pine\n Uh it wouldn\'t be pine\n,\n But surrounded me at the farthest northern edge of the world, to\n\nbe transformed from a woman into a tree to preserve your virginity\n What was that, virginity,\n Now the mother of Jesus mother help me\n But the mother of Jesus in Hulbert was Mary the young woman\n For the Reverend Jesse Lymond no hint of sex could exist in the\n\nBible, which requires some very fancy writing indeed,\n In all the one hundred and sixty-eight stories, there is not a\n\nhint of the existence of the Song of Solomon for example\n Well perhaps, the convenient excuse that a song cannot be a\n\nstory\n But then there\'s Issac for example who in Hulbert certainly has\n\nAbram for a father and Sarah for a mother but Ishmael has only his mother\n\nHagar\n As a child I did wonder what Ishmael was doing in Abram\'s tent all\n\nthe time and perhaps he also was what Popeye in the Free Press Prairie Farmer\n\ncomics would have called an  orphink \n Jungfrau\n\n\n That\'s the German technical word for it which was certainly never\n\nexplained to me\n round yon virgin\n\nmother and child \n is mentioned\n There is no mention of " the virgin mother ",\n To finally inform me in the words of my sister whom I asked,\n\n never touched by a man \n What\'s the matter with a man touching you\n that\'s for me to know and you to find out\n\n, in the maddening superiority of every older sister that has ever\n\nexisted\n And so all I could do was yell at her you don\'t know anything\n\neither\n But of course she knew\n She did\n For all that I knew she knew everything that I didn\'t which was\n\ncertainly enough,\n liars ought to have\n\ngood memories  my friend, do you have a good memory\n Or to touch the ambiguity lurking in Sidney\'s phrase of plurals do\n\nyou have good memories,\n God save us all from the present writing fad of miserable\n\nchildhoods,\n activist Robert Bly half a\n\nblank page and ten minutes on T V and he will out-miserable both novelist\n\nPatti Reagan Davis\n Her father and mother are much better known than she\n And also T V star Rosanne Arnold whose parents now pray not to be\n\nknown at all\n Genuine suffering is never a fad and never irrelevant,\n You have good memories regardless of whether they are happy ones\n\nbecause you are a good writer\n And my memories are good too because in my child\'s world to be a\n\nstorywriter was to be a liar\n You concocted made up stories\n When one writes fiction there is to put it simply and by our own\n\nadmission no actual literal smellable and touchable reality to which the\n\nwords you cluster onto the page respond\n There is no literal brown cow hiding in the bushes,\n In my growing up world there was only one true book\n The one book written by God himself long ago\n Or rather as I was told written by holy men always men only at\n\nGod\'s dictation\n\n\n like    beloved disciple John who could explicate\n\nthe entire universe in words of mostly one syllable\n And this is a miracle,\n\n That\'s two,\n Three\n,\n As a writer I\'m not for the moment interested in Saint John\'s joy\n I\'m exorcised by his word by his writing the seeing hearing\n\ntouching he seems to declare as so obviously so simply a part of the world\'s\n\nword,\n My childhood, such a tapestry of hearing and speaking words in\n\nthree languages and of seeing and reading and writing words in two of them\n\ngave me such an overwhelming gift of good memories that my good memory forces\n\nme to conclude with an affirmation it was that very interweaving of languages\n\nwhich made me a writer,\n There was never any doubt about when which language could or should\n\nbe used but the necessary frictions between them destroyed the thoughtless\n\ncomplacency often demonstrated by monolingual people about what language may\n\nbe or how it works,\n To try and explain to somehow translate or transliterate the\n\npossible vaporous ungraspable abstractions of literary or theological High\n\nGerman or English into the tightly circumscribed cryptic graspabilities of\n\nLow German,\n That\'s all I ever spoke to my mother and father for example\n Drove me far into the wilderness of each language\'s particular\n\ngenius\n Sometimes I couldn\'t find my way out\n The languages didn\'t work none of them\n A bit seemed clear in this language another bit in that or the\n\nother but never all in one,\n Sometimes as I crashed hithering on my mother would say I know\n\nalready I know what you mean, and of course I was certain she didn\'t\n How could she\n I hadn\'t even said it,\n But then again perhaps she did,\n forty\n\n    seventy-nine  ,\n And in my memory she is a mellow very gentle and wise woman who if\n\nyou disagreed about something on which she had a strong conviction\n And this happened often\n She would sometimes say not always well that\'s enough talking now\n I\'ll pray about it,\n And then I knew I might as well give up,\n\n\ncosmic connections,\n Very likely they\'re even better now,\n The point for me is, every writing reflects a literal reality\n Whether that reality is physically historically verifiable or not\n\nreally does not matter,\n Writing can and does create realities more truly experiential than\n\nmere facticity, and therefore the distinction commonly made between a true\n\nstory and a fiction or a myth, beyond factual verifiability is literarily\n\nwithout useful meaning\n Reading for over half a century has convinced me that the best\n\nwriting is often a more powerful experience of the actual world then the\n\npersonal so-called, firsthand actual experience ,\n We all know that\n You all know that\n You and I thousands of other readers have seen the prairie far\n\nbeyond our individual limited perception because    as \n\n for me in my house in  Thorasus   eyes\n No one who has ever read Naomi Woolf\'s The Beauty Myth can ever\n\nagain consider the women displayed in contemporary advertising and see them\n\nin the same old way,\n You\'ll have to excuse me\n I\'m, blurting out matters of serious import with unconscionable\n\nboldness,\n You and I have discussed this often and will again and again\n\nbecause the creation of, formerly unsuspected realities with words is all\n\nour writing is about or all it needs to be about,\n And the way in which, Saint John in his letter deals with this\n\nmatter confirms  me \n And I do appreciate a Hebrew confirmation, especially one with\n\na boost from Greek theoretical philosophy\n The word of life, at the beginning, for me the\n\noverwhelmingly powerful Hebrew creation story is the one where everything\n\nthat is comes into existence when God said  And it was \n So look around you,\n,\n Let me wander into another word world and tell you how the\n\nexcremental world of sewers, shaped my writer\'s imagination\n placement of\n\n the story\n and it\n\nwas commissioned by Alberta Culture\n Not the subject\n Just the story,\n And well you know uh Alberta Culture one must tread very lightly\n\non both the sacred and the excremental\n After this initial politeness we can get on to, extrapolating\n\nimplications which might be more fun,', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'bd77ba5a-7d5d-4b7c-966b-f6cc90d738f4', 'added':

{'text': '<$A>  this is the first, letter, and it\'s\n\ncalled For the Benefits of a Poster, The Discovery of Deserts Giants and\n\nSewers\n My dear friend,\n A writerly greeting with a text, by the late Algernon Sidney\n Very late actually\n Somewhere uh before uh sixteen eighty-three\n\n\n one bit of ambiguous advice for people in our profession and it is this\n\n liars out to have good memories ,\n It has always made me happy to know that if you and I had not been\n\nwriters we would never have met\n But since we are both we did meet and in that way we were mutually\n\nresponsible for at least the possible beginning of our friendship,\n The contemporary world places a most disproportionate emphasis on\n\nindividual freedom\n We call self-determination a right with a general understanding it\n\nis worth dying for, even though everyone knows how much of our life is\n\nquite beyond our determination <unclear> word </unclear> our control\n The time and country of one\'s birth one\'s parents one\'s genetic\n\nprogramming the food one is fed the very size of one\'s toes or nose or cock\n\nor breasts any of these and or a thousand other personal details can be\n\ncritical traumatic of life importance and every one is quite beyond our self\n\ndetermination\n The fact that I have a certain type of red colour blindness could\n\npresumably at some point kill me though it hasn\'t yet, and nevertheless it\n\nhas certainly prevented me from becoming the airplane pilot or painter I\n\nsometimes as a child dreamed about\n While at the same time it grants me the freedom to walk about\n\nsometimes quite unselfconsciously in clothes of embarrassing colour\n\ncombinations as close friends tell me\n This uncontrollable genetic inheritance apparently granted me by my\n\nmother who herself had a superb eye for colour may very well be the reason\n\nwhy since the age of six I have found it necessary to inflict upon myself the\n\nessential suffering of chewing my fingernails,\n, human beings have developed towards any kind\n\nof freedom beyond the other animals it is surely because of their developed\n\nability to think in image and abstraction\n The Saskatchewan homestead where I was born had more animal than\n\nhuman companionship to offer\n The behaviour of cows, when I had to herd them in the unfenced\n\nbush was highly instructive to me\n Cows, wanted some simple things\n They wanted to eat grass to drink water to protect and nurse their\n\ncalves to lie about and chew their cud and at various times  \n\n to mount   and be mounted by another cow\n Now this latter process seemed to be the only fun they ever had\n It could continue for an entire day\n Such a cowish expression of intimate bodily concern for one another\n\n<,> never evident between them otherwise\n One after another they hoisted themselves ponderously up on their\n\nback legs and leaped before they missed which as they sometimes did to clasp\n\nthe afflicted or playful one again and again offering their clumsy mysterious\n\nsolicitude\n The arrival of any scrawny bull however instantly changed all that\n\ninto domineering into a great deal of roaring of bellowing okay okay I\'m here\n\njust get out of the road I\'ll take care of it, shoving everyone aside and\n\nsimply doing the same thing in his massive pointed way violent and fast,\n\nand that finished the fun, and the caring\n\n\n it seems in sort of growing discouragement each cow went back to her\n\nsolitary boring, normality of tearing up grass\n It happened often enough but the cows never seemed to anticipate\n\n<,> that the bull would spoil their cowish delight enjoy it then chase \n\n  them   away\n\n Truly stupid these cows\n They never remembered anything\n\n\nimmediately under their broad wet noses\n They never seemed to have thought like there should be grass here\n\nfor example or we should keep this bull away or he\'ll finish our fun and\n\ngames\n Never\n On the other hand, my mother and I talked of all sorts of\n\npossibilities that hadn\'t even happened yet\n\n\nscrub broken out of his fence again\n\n\nLawrence  will have every farmer mad at him again from here to \n\nEstevan  just like last year,\n And I\'d respond hopefully, maybe somebody\'ll load up his gun or\n\nrifle or something and shoot it,\n Our house never had a rifle in it,\n Even when our neighbours came by hunting in fall as they often did\n\ntheir heavy rifles stayed in    their   wagon or\n\ntheir saddles or at worse, tilted against the wall in the step outside the\n\ndoor\n\n\nwilful  ones\n Of course my subsequent ignorance, of guns transformed them into\n\na fascinating mystery which is why  I mentioned of it  every <unclear>\n\nword </unclear> chance I had at whatever length I could spin out\n My mother would shake her head stop talking like that nobody will\n\nshoot anything, and change the subject\n Does Nellie still hide in the bush so much\n She doesn\'t want to come home\n Maybe we should hang this small bell on her,\n Thinking into these matters now it seems to me that,\n\nsubliminally I already knew at the age of seven or eight about the time when\n\nI began milking and discovered at the tips of my fingers the refined\n\ncontinuous possibility of pain if one seriously chewed one\'s nails, I\n Uh squeezing tough bush tips taut with milk can build up\n\nexcruciating levels\n I knew that the human ability to think to image was inextricably\n\nlinked    to our ability   to speak\n The language of my mother and myself was somehow our mutually\n\nagreed upon sound image of the observably factual world,\n In an instant we could create the world in sound unhindered by\n\nplace or by time past present future simply offer more possibilities without\n\nany of the world having to be actually physically present\n What an incredible gift language,\n With a puff of air you could conjure up Nellie surely the stupidest\n\nof brown cows without dragging that huge and invariably spring green grass\n\nshit-slimed lump of bovinity into the house with you,\n What power of dealing with the world,\n Words what incredible freedom,\n Years later I recognized that the Hebrew myth of human creation\n\nunderscored this same concept\n Perhaps I had heard the strange story of Eve and Adam mutilated too\n\noften, from too many pulpits to notice this understanding about language\n\nearlier\n In Genesis chapter two Adam is alone in Eden and in the process of\n\nnaming the animals that is, inventing human language and he discovers that\n\nnone of them are fit for him\n Somehow language itself the names he gives the animals and he is\n\nfree to    call\n\n  them anything he wishes reveals to him their distinct animal\n\nnatures\n These creatures are different from me\n They are not my fit companions,\n Now when he complains to Yahweh about this Yahweh puts him to sleep\n\nand makes Eve out of Adam\'s rib,\n Now by an inexplicable linguistic accident the English words\n\n" man " and " woman " mirror    the Hebrew pun   on the two words used in the original\n\nstory a pun which in turn presumably mirrors the physical pun of Yahweh\'s\n\nplaying on Adam as it were a linguistic echo of that duplication with a\n\nsignificant difference\n I first noticed this curiosity because the pun doesn\'t work in\n\nGerman\n share neither sound nor sense\n\nnor even a single letter,\n But Luther in his translation thought this word play so crucial\n\nthat he invented a word by force, using    \n\nMann    and then attaching a feminine ending to it,\n umlaut\n he called it, to put the pun\n\nacross\n\n\nMann  and  M&auml;nnin  and the word exists only\n\nin Luther\'s Bible  at Genesis chapter two verse twenty-three\n You can look it up,\n As an aside that particular Genesis story of human creation\n There is an earlier one in Chapter one\n Has always struck me as ambiguously problematic\n The language pun is essential to the story because, it seems\n\nYahweh is playing a joke on Adam\n fit and proper for\n\nhimself\n Well Yahweh makes him one out of himself\n Adam laughs because of course he gets the joke and names Eve\n\naccordingly\n He\'s been practicing naming creatures after all\n Me man\n You woman,\n But it seems, Yahweh has the last laugh\n of a health\n\nmate  would be so incredibly helpful to get them both kicked out of\n\nparadise\n Wow that\'s a helpful companionship alright\n It\'s a big cosmic joke I\'d say\n In my less hilarious moments I find the Native Canadian Yellowknife\n\nstory of human creation first recorded in English in an eighteen thirty-six\n\nmuch more helpful and I intend the pun\n Uh that Yellowknife story also begins with a solitary man but it\n\ncentres on his living with a Ptarmigan\n That is an animal which in Hebrew terms is prohibitively different\n\nfrom man\n, and the two of them making\n\n  a pair of snowshoes,\n Man Ptarmigan and snowshoes it\'s a superb story\n You should look that one up too,\n if you want to,\n Well in beginning with speech it followed that in learning how to\n\nread, I was making the next step into image and abstraction that of\n\nphysically seeing of physically seeing a commonly agreed upon symbol of the\n\nsound which in turn was the image of the factuality of the world, alright\n\n<,,> I experienced all around me\n And obviously that concept would work itself back into a different\n\ndirection as well\n If it comes from the factuality of the world, it can also work\n\nitself back in a different way,\n the symbol of the\n\nsound which was the image of a world I might never yet have seen, but\n\nwhich existed somewhere, either in actuality or in the imagination of the\n\nmaker of the symbols,\n I will return to discuss this latter point\n For the moment let me say that I devoured the miracle of language\n\nwritten, of book\n In nineteen seventy-one a former teacher told me that by the time I\n\nfinished grade two, that is June nineteen forty-three I had read every\n\nbook in the  Treadwell  Saskatchewan School District library\n Now granted, the entire, district consisted of a one room one\n\nlog school , with four shelves of very worn books, some\n\nin classroom sets and a small cupboard with doors that stood directly below\n\nthe window high on the east wall\n I still remember the tiny knobs on the library cupboard doors\n They were the first machined knobs I had ever seen\n They were so absently round and smooth with a screw in their\n\ncentre\n The school door itself had a metal knob you had to turn to open\n On our farm you opened things from outside by pulling on leather\n\nloops nailed onto them or from inside by jerking a string that lifted the\n\noutside latches\n In nineteen seventy-one my former teacher, whom I had not met\n\nsince nineteen forty-three told me about my early reading as we leaned out of\n\nthe big hole of where the school\'s large west windows used to be the ones\n\noverlooking the hallowed space where the ball diamond had been, the\n\nsod-covered barn where we used to stable our horses for the day and the hill\n\n<,> where we slid on our sleds and skis all winter and wrestled each in the\n\nsnow when we as we always did spilled\n The log shell of the school still existed twenty-one years ago',

the\n\npolitical project of what she terms postmodern feminism\n cyborg unities are monstrous and illegitimate\n\n\n,\n There are however extremely good reasons to be sceptical of the\n\nalliance wrought by Hollinger,\n First, cyberpunk is an almost exclusively a male domain\n In the words of Pat Murphy an award winning author of feminist\n\nscience fiction speaking on a women\'s panel on the

from K W Jeter Lewis Shiner uhm Joseph Shirley uh largely all men\n\nand with    perhaps the   only major exception of\n\nthe recent novel by Pat Cadigan called Sinners which has just come out,\n A second reason for scepticism is the fact that cyberpunk\'s interest\n\nin demonstrating the permeability of the human body does not ultimately\n\ndisplace or even volatize what  are  sorry volatize the category of\n\nman rather the masculinist domination of a feminized virtual reality\n It\'s a long phrase that I will sketch out further later on\n The masculinist domination of a feminized virtual reality in\n\nGibson\'s Neuromancer represents what Arther Kroker describes as the \n\nhyperinfusion of power by a male sex which seeks to hide the privileging of\n\nthe phallocentric gaze by theorizing the disappearance of its power into\n\nseduction ,\n It is my contention that much of cyberpunk\'s problematization of\n\nthe humanist subject and the real simulation opposition inscribes an acute\n\nanxiety of male displacement even as it heralds the age of homo datum,\n The electronic space which at once threatens male power while\n\nsimultaneously offering new opportunities for

simply the tools of their trade but the very condition of\n\ntheir identity and their being \n\n\n\n<$A>  which begins the story is\n\nthis\n\n,\n This is from Victor Hugo Les Misérables, eighteen\n\nsixty-two\n\n\n   years     weeks   before I entered\n\nmy last year of high school I bought Victor Hugo\'s massive novel Les\n\nMisérables, the English edition one thousand two hundred and\n\ntwenty-two pages long published in nineteen thirty-one by the Modern Library\n\nof the World\'s Best Book The Giant Series translated by Charles E Wilbur\n That same summer I worked on the construction crew that was laying\n\nthe first water and sewer mains under the streets of  Creighton  the\n\ntown where I lived\n I was seventeen\n population eight hundred had of course no\n\nbookstore\n Neither did nearby Lethbridge population twenty-two thousand\n But sometime earlier I had discovered that the stationery store on\n\nSeventh Street South did offer a back corner with a few world classics\n None of which had ever been written in Canada of course,\n In December nineteen fifty-one I had bought my first book there\n\nPickwick Papers by Charles Dickens and I spent all of Christmas Day except\n\nthe compulsory Sunday morning uh church service, morning uh lying on the\n\nliving room couch laughing myself into fits, until my mother whose gift to\n\nme the book was decided she had made a mistake in letting me choose it,\n She had had no choice\n I wanted a book for Christmas and she could not read English\n But, to waste an entire serious holiday laughing,\n Fortunately I was a fast reader though enjoyment and coughing\n\nslowed me down on this one,\n But Les Misérables was no novel of laughter and forgetting\n Not even in a brilliant windy southern Alberta summer Sunday, of\n\nthe early fifties\n Nor can the present world tour musical version of that story make\n\nit that,\n As Hugo states in his nineteen sixty-two preface the book deals\n\nwith,  the degradation of man by poverty the ruin of women by\n\nstarvation and the dwarfing of childhood by physical and spiritual night\n\n,\n Now the fact is that most modern Canadians like myself are\n\nimmeasurably fortunate\n Not one of these conditions has ever really applied to us\n Nevertheless, in July nineteen ninety-one when I walked along\n\nthe beautiful streets of present-day  Creighton  I remember the deep\n\ntrenches that piled up the earth here in  pyramidal  rows thirty-nine\n\nyears ago, the sewers that surely still lie where I helped place them and\n\nI also think of the hero of Les Misérables Jean Valjean, carrying\n\nhis, unconscious enemy, with such ineffable honour through the immense\n\nleviathan sewers, of eighteen thirty Paris,\n To descend into the sewer, is to enter the grave\n\n,\n Now anyone in their right minds knows that the prairie town is,\n\nnot Paris France\n Such knowledge is particularly obvious to those who year after year\n\nlive in such a town\n The main irrigation ditch which still marks the southern boundary\n\nof  Creighton  does not run through the middle of it like the Seine\n\nthrough Paris, that ditch, which then watered all the gardens and the\n\nsmall strawberry patches and corn and bean fields which filled every cistern\n\nfilled, under and beside every tiny wooden house through an intricate web\n\nof overgrown ditches, supposedly    kept clear\n\n  of weeds and wading widdling children by the one hired town worker\n\nwho was all    at the   same time the constable\n\nthe volunteer fire chief the dog catcher the wooden sidewalk repairman and\n\nthe waterman,\n That ditch of reverse tributaries was certainly no Seine River,\n The glazed clay and the much larger concrete sewer pipes, which\n\nthe workers of Bennett and White Limited Edmonton nested in the sand fitted\n\ntogether and buried beneath the streets, in nineteen fifty-two were\n\nnothing at all like the legendary architectured Paris sewers begun somewhere\n\nin the middle ages and which in the nineteenth century had become both a\n\ngrave, and an asylum for crime intelligent social protest liberty of\n\nconscience and every conceivable human debauchery as Hugo writes  day\n\nand night \n sewers were\n\ntoo small even for a child to crawl into,\n Not a single one of them was then large enough, for a big man to\n\nwalk in erect and leave alone carry another, draped over his shoulder,\n\n\nBruneseau, who in, eighteen oh five would be the one man in all of\n\nNapoleon\'s empire brave enough to enter the Paris sewers and then spend seven\n\nyears expanding their network\n Creighton\n\n project, in less than two months before it was completed I was fired\n\n<,,>\n Creighton\n\n, I was a labourer a grunt,  when our  work was mostly\n\nfitting and carrying things of digging them up or burying them in places\n\ndesignated by the foreman and various bosses   \n\nall of whom came   from somewhere else\n A nice brainless business being a grunt\n You just do everything anyone orders you because you\'re right down\n\nthere at the bottom with the sewer pipe as low as you\'ll get without more\n\ndigging which you\'ll have to do yourself,\n I however was a shade less grunty than most, for some reason\n Because I could read and write\n I, can\'t remember anyone having asked me to demonstrate it\n On the very first day the project engineer pointed at me and the\n\n fat  foreman said you go with him\n So there I was frequently without a shovel, riding about town\n\n<,> in the engineer\'s brown Model A Ford\n A curiosity even then\n The rod and chain man,\n While my fellow grunts heaved sand and gravel and cement into the\n\ngrinding maw of a mixer, or backfilled around pipe deep in the trench,\n\nor muscled clay joints and concrete manholes sectioned  above  the\n\ntrucks I held a graduated stick motionless, or anchored what I at first\n\nsupposed was an endless measuring tape,\n Hold it right there\n Don\'t move it\n But quickly discovered it was a chain, a steel chain certainly\n\n<,> but nothing at all like the one riveted around Jean Valjean\'s neck, to\n\nmarch him to the prison galleys of Toulon,\n\n\n romance like Les Misérables where everyone especially the\n\nvillains always and continuously return, until all are either dead or\n\nmarried, which in most romances not Hugo\'s    amounts\n\n  to the same thing I would by now have met that engineer again,\n Perhaps five years older than I a third year civil engineering\n\nstudent at the University of Alberta on his summer job,\n His blond tough and compact body shorter than mine\n His slightly lopsided grin with a tooth missing on the right side\n\n<,>\n But I cannot remember his name, nor will he remember the gangly\n\nkid he left to lounge in the shade of his Model A while the other grunts\n\nsweated and gasped in the burning sun and he argued with the foreman\n I didn\'t lounge often for within two days I had learned the grunt\'s\n\nbasic survival rules\n One\n Never sit down,\n Two\n Never stand with your hands in your pockets,\n But often the engineer did not need me and then I worked with the\n\nrest and that was when the others who were never told to sit in the Model A\n\ngot their small revenges on me\n The heavy ends of the pipes\n The extra shovelling where there was room for only one to work\n supported\n\n the trench,  walls  oozed and bulged ominously between their\n\nhorizontal braces,\n He was wading, in the hideous muck of the city all\n\ndripping with slime \n,\n The best trench workers quickly proved to be the older immigrant\n\nmen who had somehow survived the war and had managed with what was left of\n\ntheir families to get into Canada,\n Those were the refugees, displaced persons or D Ps as they were\n\ncalled derisively or schmoes, as we called them I don\'t even know how to\n\nspell that    word  , after the subhuman\n\ncritters in the very popular    Li\'l \n\n Abner comic strip,\n They worked at anything without question,\n\n\n the precise   details of racism, but it certainly did not save\n\nthem from its pervasive abusive tone\n That racism bothered me,\n Mostly to be honest about it for myself,\n After all though born in Canada I was of refugee parents myself\n At home we had never spoken but an obscure German dialect, a\n\nlanguage I used to explain the foreman\'s peremptory orders to my fellow,\n\nMennonite D P labourers,\n But tired muscles and common sweat soon pushed such attitudes in a\n\nwork gang aside,\n\n\n  deride   a man not for his race but for his evasions for his\n\nlaziness,\n It seems to me now that thinking back to that nineteen fifty-two\n\n<,> that male concepts about women, are much harder to change than their\n\nprejudice about race,\n Oh the summer girls walking by with their brief blouses knotted up\n\nunder their breasts, their white shorts their arms and legs week by week\n\nturning a deeper more  Olympic  golden brown under that libidinous sun\n\n<,,>', 'subdomain': 'CANADA_S_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

the trench,\n From below at least, they sounded indistinct merely animals\n\nyowling,\n The young engineer spoke very little\n He never said a word when a woman passed,\n Sometimes he would smile but he kept on working\n One of his main jobs was to make, certain that the sewer was\n\nlaid absolutely on gradient, and that\'s where his arguments with the\n\nforeman started\n Time and again to prove his points about the violation of\n\nbenchmarks he had set I\'d have to slide down into the cool sweet earth and\n\nwork my extended measuring rod as directed from one joint to another along\n\nthose

hole\n\ncapacity and percentage fill,\n word\n\n</unclear> shoved into sewers, the engineer muttered grimly to me who had\n\nno opinion but at dislocated moments might provide an ear\n Shit apparently was the least of it,\n Why in this sewer summer of nineteen fifty-two at eighty-two cents\n\nan hour    it was the most I\'d ever\n\nearned   did I begin with Hugo rather than with any other Modern\n\nLibrary giant, two ninety-five each then,  like\n\nCervantes <unclear> word </unclear> Pushkin Joyce Tolstoy  \n\n the ones   I bought latter,\n because of its giant intestine\n\n<,> the cloaca which as Hugo explains it has been the disease of Paris\n\nthroughout history\n In Part Five of Les Misérables he describes it for fifteen\n\npages, and then he devotes another twenty-three, to getting Jean\n\nValjean with Marius on his shoulder out of that sewer\n Well why,\n Why did I buy this book\n how I\n\ndealt   how one dealt   with shit,\n Clearly,\n How did one,\n Clearly the world including me was full of it, and here on the\n\napparently open prairie,    there\n\nwere neither enough   bushes, nor even spaces as it seemed to me\n\nthere\'d always been in  Estevan  Saskatchewan where I lived the first\n\ntwelve years of my life    there were not\n\n  bushes nor spaces for it to be properly voided unseen and\n\nthereafter to be    permitted   the privacy\n\nof its individual disintegration,\n In sunny southern Alberta it seemed necessary to rip up the\n\nlandscape  and  yell about it in the streets,\n, Holding this immense novel in my hand in\n\nnineteen ninety-one I am suddenly certain, that I bought it originally\n\nbecause of the sewer, for I had read the story much earlier in\n\nSaskatchewan when I was eleven, a simplified version by Solomon Cleaver\n\nthat had from somewhere contained pictures\n school I\'m reading Jean Valjean\n\nas the book is called leaning against the warm galvanized guard of the heater\n\nwhich is two gas barrels welded together\n On

carries the wounded Marius, to safety through the filthy\n\nsewers of Paris ,\n Jean is lank-haired old man\n His face contorted\n Above his waist in what seems to be, molten lead,\n Behind him the glooming maw of the sewer twists away into darkness\n\n<,>\n Carried to safety\n When I go to find Jean Valjean in the university library I discover\n\nit in the, Canadian Literature section,\n It seems Solomon Cleaver was a young minister of Winnipeg who\n\ndecided to tell the stories in his own words rather like Hulbert with the\n\nBible\n Not even God could write well enough for him\n The Reverend Cleaver repeated the story more than eight hundred\n\ntimes to over one hundred thousand people and was obliged to reject one\n\ninvitation every four, which crowded upon him\n continues he was\n\nprevailed upon to have it published first in nineteen thirty-five and then\n\nafter ten reprintings Clarke Irwin of Toronto brought it out as a true\n\nCanadian classic,\n And the pictures fourteen in all from an early-thirties French\n\nmovie,\n Cosette leaning over a dying Jean looks like Greta Garbo, in\n\ngolden ringlets,\n And the sewer\n Surely every young lover deserves to be carried, from the fallen\n\nbarricades of his revolution to safety through a filthy sewer\n How could Solomon Cleaver squeeze Victor Hugo\'s gigantic story onto\n\none hundred and nineteen book-sized pages,\n Jean Valjean\'s passage through the sewer shrinks from thirty-nine\n\npages to six hundred and twenty-seven words\n The final two chapters are transformed into a single verse from get\n\nthis a Scottish    hymn,\n How truly classic Canadian,\n is most\n\ncertainly a place also,\n In late August nineteen fifty-two the trench had reached the\n\nwestern end of town  and my fellow grunt and I, were hand\n\ntunnelling a side branch, of it under the sidewalk in front of the hotel\n\ndirectly beneath the Ladies and Escort sign\n are old enough to know what that\n\nmeans,    in the   history of Alberta\n\ndrinking,\n We are tunnelling this little side branch, of the main tunnel\n\n,\n We took turns\n\n\n and pulling   back a short spadeful of earth while the other used\n\na long shovel to throw it up onto street level,\n I\n\ncould see at my feet   only my friend\'s head, sprinkled with red\n\nclay and talking\n Talking Low German as he had all afternoon\n Me intense with listening,\n Holy shit you buggars\n\n\n  fucking   job done with that speed\n It was the foreman,\n His bulging face tilted down at us, maybe about to topple right\n\ninto the ditch on top of us\n But I was somewhere very far away\n Nineteen forty-four\n watching refugees push their carts through the\n\nfrozen mud of Stalin\'s oppression surrounded by the German Army\'s disastrous\n\nretreat across the endless devastating vistas of the Ukrainian steppes\n Shut yourself I yelled up\n so hard in the hotel\n\nevery day    getting   drunk,\n Well after that we had nothing to do but drop our shovels right\n\nthere\n\n And get out of that ditch, and hoof it over to the office\n\nportable and pick up our last cheque,\n The foreman drove his pickup there to tell the bookkeeper, and\n\nhe sure as hell wasn\'t giving no smartassed little bastards a lift,\n So we walked east the entire length of Main Street all cut up with\n\nbumpy trenches, and I felt stupid because my big mouth had gotten  John\n\n fired but he just laughed,\n He was two years older than I but his father had vanished long ago\n\nin, Stalin\'s Siberia, and he and his mother and younger siblings were\n\ntrue refugees working at   \n\nanything to make a living  \n He laughed and said school started in a week anyway\n He was going to school and learn to be a good Canadian just like me\n\n<,,>\n Well here it is nineteen ninety-one in a prairie town\n It\'s uniquely its own place, in the darkened summer sun,\n\nspread across the wide land dark trees and roofs surrounded by the white\n\nspray of irrigation sprinklers moving steadily across and around the fields\n No more men in gumboots, leaning on shovels opening up little\n\nditches,\n\n\n\n Population five thousand two hundred and eighty,\n Here and there among the bungalows, the small old houses sit\n\nwell below street level\n The green rushes grow in the seepage along the main ditch\n The giant cottonwoods still lean over its surprisingly
