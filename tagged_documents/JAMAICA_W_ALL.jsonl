{'text': "The Jamaica university students should not pay fees for their\n\neducation.  \n\n  The cost of education in Jamaica is said to be sometimes\n\nprohibitive and encourages a better educational standard among the wealthy\n\nand conversely low achievements among those students at the lower strata of\n\nour society.\n There is ongoing debate if Jamaican university students should pay for\n\ntheir education. \n\n  The way forward for any nation is to have an educated populace,\n\ntherefore tertiary education is the catalyst to take us into the next\n\ncentury.\n Higher learning must be made more readily available to more citizens\n\nthereby reengineering the structure of our society, as it would filter down\n\nto the nether regions of the communities.\n\n\n  The majority of parents complain of the cost of tuition from\n\nprimary/preparatory Schools through secondary Schools and by the time\n\nuniversity comes along they are at the end of their wits to find new\n\nfinancing.\n had been\n\non hold for so many years.\n had been great,\n\nforegoing their own pleasures so that the children may have a better\n\nlifestyle than they had; sometimes neglecting each other for the sake of the\n\nkids.\n These parents are now asked to mortgage their very souls for the\n\nbenefit of their siblings.\n The resultant pressure harasses even the most devoted mother and\n\nfather. \n\n  So too the average working person who decides to continue his/her\n\neducation.\n to\n\nsave the money for school and the unemployment situation in the country\n\ndetermines that fewer persons are able to save towards schooling. \n\n  At the macro level, we have to look at the state of our economy\n\nwhich has recorded little growth or negative growth over the past decades.\n The small slice of the pie given towards education hardly maintains\n\nour schools.\n We must ask ourselves if this brittle state of affairs can withstand\n\nthe added weight of free university education.\n At present each student is subsidised, somewhere in the region of\n\neighty-five percent, and it would come as no surprise if the University of\n\nthe West Indies is owed a tidy sum. \n\n  If the doors at Mona were thrown open to all and sundry, persons\n\nwho have satisfied the matriculation requirements of course, then the\n\npopulation on campus would increase substantially  .\n The immediate problem of a lack of space would have to be rectified.\n\n\n\n  There are those who argue that the thought of free university\n\neducation would engender a freeness mentality among students and that this\n\nlearning would be more readily appreciated if one has to suffer to achieve.\n\n\n\n  It would be retrograde to keep on increasing fees at the Mona\n\ncampus without due concern for other variables.\n Perhaps annual increases could be linked to the rate of inflation,\n\ncertainly no more, or tied to the percentage increase in the pay package of\n\ncivil servants or a medium between the two.\n There could be more novel ways of keeping the cost of tertiary\n\neducation down because some way must be found to have more persons exposed to\n\nhigher learning.\n\n\n  The arguments for and against fees for university education will\n\ncontinue to abound.\n Fees must be paid to keep the institution viable.\n\n\nbut  so we must discover new ways to fund this venture.\n scope of the Students Loan Bureau may have to\n\nbe reorganized, but ways must be found to make the university more accessible\n\nto the ordinary Jamaican.\n\n\n\n\n  Jamaican University Of The West\n\nIndies students should not be required to pay fees for their education. \n\n \n\n  The University of the West Indies has been increasing school fees\n\nalmost annually.\n Therefore more and more people are finding it difficult to attend\n\nuniversity, especially those from the poorer class.\n The trend we are now seeing is similar to that of the nineteen\n\nsixties when only the offspring of the upper class could get a university\n\neducation. \n\n  With school fees in the\n\n$60,000 range and Basic Minimum Wage annually is\n\n$38,400, it is virtually impossible for a poor person to send their child /\n\nchildren to university.\n Even with the presence of the students loan bureau, there are still\n\npersons who did not qualify and yet had passed the matriculation test for\n\nuniversity. Those people are denied a university education. \n\n  In my opinion therefore, Jamaican students should not be required\n\nto pay for their university fees, as Michael Manley said in the 1970's\n\n \x1cFree education for all\x1c  .\n Even with the fees being subsidized by the government, it is still\n\nunaffordable.\n What we should be required to pay is caution and maintenance fees,\n\nbut tuition should be free. \n\n  Should education be free, then automatically an increase in brain\n\npowers hence an increase in technology.\n This would result in much more productivity and efficiency.\n .\n The areas of agriculture, manufacturing and information technology\n\nwould see us being more competitive. \n\n  As it is now with our economic situation, with the unavailability\n\nof jobs for qualified personnel, Jamaica is now experiencing a massive brain\n\ndrain.\n Qualified people are now migrating to first world countries in the\n\nhope of finding greener pastures.\n However, with free university education, increase in technology;\n\nincrease in productivity, and increase in export, hence a better standard of\n\nliving, therefore reducing migration. \n\n  This would place Jamaica on the verge of becoming a more\n\ndeveloped country. \n\n  The university could put in place a rigid bond system that could\n\nbe similar to other tertiary institution, such as teachers colleges, where\n\nstudents would be bonded to serve the country for at least three years. \n\n  Let us not defeat the objective of our late leader Michael\n\nManley.\n Instead strive to provide an excellent and affordable education\n\nsystem for under privilege people who has the potential to do well for our\n\ncountry. \n\n\n\n  TOPIC: JAMAICAN STUDENTS SHOULD NOT PAY FOR THEIR UNIVERSITY\n\nEDUCATION  \n\n  \x1cthe\n\ndevelopment of character or mental powers, or the acquisition of in <l>\n\ntellectual, moral and social instructions.\x1c  \n\n  It is the desire of individual from all stratus of the society to\n\nbecome educated.\n\n\n highest level of training within the Caribbean and it is to this\n\ninstitution which most persons aspire. \n\n  The topic states that Jamaican students should not pay for their\n\nuniversity Education.\n arise:\n mean that other\n\nstudents who are non-Jamaican should be required to pay, but not Jamaicans.\n If so on what basis was this disparity arrived at.\n Are students assessed on their Country's economic status, their level\n\nof literacy or the benefits the country receives from training its students.\n 2. Would Jamaican students entering university in other regions\n\nof the  Caribbean be expected to pay tuition\n\nfees, or should it be applicable only to those students studying in Jamaica.\n\n\n\n \n Jamaican university students should be required to pay for their\n\neducation, whether they study in Jamaica or inter-regional.\n\n\npropels   one to higher levels of social mobility, greater\n\nmarketability of skills and flexible earning power should have some cost\n\nattached.\n Paying for such tool lends itself to greater appreciation and a\n\ngreat desire to    excel   , as oppose to the\n\nfact that if it was free the freeness mentality would rob the essence out of\n\nthe desire to achieve. \n\n  Though there should be a cost to university education for it to\n\nbe

ones already in operation.\n\n\n of scholarships and grants must be present especially for persons\n\nstudying at university level.\n a\n\nreality both Government and the private sector must become

Topic: Jamaican University students should not be\n\nallowed to pay fees for their education.  \n\n  A University education is necessary for those students who aim to\n\nachieve more than just an ordinary level of education.\n It is geared toward helping students develop to the fullest their\n\npotentials, to reflect more precisely, to express themselves more    cogently   and to be able to communicate more\n\nclearly on different issues.\n At the end of a University education, students will become more aware\n\nof the changes in their environment and to cope with these changes.\n Students will be able to compete in the working world as they will\n\nhave the aptitude to produce optimum quality work. \n\n  A University education is a necessary choice made by parents and\n\nstudents so in order to achieve their goals, parents and students must be\n\nprepared to put in the necessary resources to get the desired results.\n I think that Jamaican University students should be allowed to pay\n\nfees for their education. \n\n  In the Jamaican society, with all the economic pressures that the\n\ncountry faces, it would be a rather difficult task for the government to pay\n\nfor the education of all Jamaican students.\n Students in other Caribbean countries and even the developed world do\n\npay for their education at the university level.\n In recent years, students after completing their course of study at\n\nthe University, migrate to other countries, without even making any\n\nmeaningful contribution of their own country.\n Other students whose education was financed through the Students Loan\n\nBureau, refuse to pay back the loans they received thus making it difficult\n\nfor other students who want to use this facility. \n\n  The University has various commitments and expenses to take care\n\nof on a regular basis in order to maintain the institution and keep\n\nfunctioning in a satisfactory manner.\n There are various areas in which the fees that student pay are used\n\nto assist in this proper functioning of the University.\n There are members of the academic, administrative and ancillary staff\n\nto be paid, cottages and halls of residence to maintain, utility bills to be\n\nmet, and campus grounds to be kept in good order.\n The University also provides recreational facilities for students and\n\nstaff alike, and security personnels are placed at different points on the\n\ncampus grounds to see to the well of all concerned. \n\n  Even though Jamaican University students should be allowed to pay\n\nfees for their education, consideration should be given to and provisions\n\nmade for less fortunate  students  to get a university education.\n There are many students who have the ability and potential to achieve\n\nbut are unable to do so because of financial   \n\ndifficulties   .\n get grants and\n\nscholarships to assist them.\n students'\n\n   financial difficulties, they should be made to earn their keep\n\nand  'earn while they learn'  .\n students will appreciate the\n\nsacrifice made and work harder to achieve their goals. \n\n  In conclusion, it is important for Jamaican University students\n\nto pay fees for their education, as these fees assist in maintaining the life\n\nof the institutions in the continuation of  programmes  and facilities\n\nfor other students  who attend these institutions\n\nyear after year.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a24aab44-bb0b-4389-aeb5-cd4ba1359062', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.266238+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': 'University Student Should Not Pay Fees For Their Education  \n\n  It is my view that Jamaican University students should not pay\n\nfees for their education.\n Every month, religiously, twenty-five percent of one\'s income goes\n\ntowards Income Tax.\n This allocation is supposed to cater to the basic needs of one\'s\n\nsociety.\n These needs include: Education, Proper Infrastructure ( Light, Water,\n\nHousing, Roads, Proper Health Facilities) among others.\n As is the system that obtains, Education at the Tertiary level can be\n\nrealized but at exorbitant costs.\n on\n\nthe part of the government.\n Law-abiding, hard-working members of our society have invested\n\nmillions of Jamaican Dollars in Income Tax but have not reaped the dividends\n\nin the form of free Tertiary Education.\n "\n\npurse"  by way of Income Tax Tertiary Education should be fully\n\nsubsidized. \n\n  Let me remind our Principals, the powers that be, that our\n\nchildren are the future.\n for the\n\nfuture - investments are made in high yielding  " instruments"\n\n to ensure that maximum returns are achieved.\n The government has been a trifle myopic in the sense that sufficient\n\nallowances have not been made for Tertiary Education, at which level the\n\nfuture of the nation hinges.\n At the level of education in question, students trained, nurtured and\n\ngroomed for various professions.\n The University, essentially fit students, young adults, for various\n\npositions in the commercial and Professional arenas of our Society.\n Needless to say, if the government fails to provide free education at\n\nthe Tertiary level then our future is at stake.\n\n\nspin-offs   from free Tertiary Education:\n Free University Education may suggest an increase in the number of\n\nindividuals to whom the same level of education  becomes\n\navailable.\n suggest a more\n\nqualified work force.\n A qualified work force implies an increase in production.\n Subsequently, there may be a reduction in the nation\'s cost of\n\nliving.\n Where there\'s a low cost of living, members of the society can enjoy\n\na sense of euphoria.\n One Hundred percent subsidy along the lines of Tertiary Education may\n\nalso imply more qualified Teachers.\n This would, no doubt, eliminate the incidence of Pre-trained\n\nteachers, hence an improvement in the quality of our Education.\n A strong educational foundation is reflective of a solid future.\n as a\n\nNation, our future, our children, must be assured of a solid education. \n\n  I am aware, however, that there are some persons who may argue\n\nagainst the idea that University education should be free where Jamaicans are\n\nconcerned.\n In response to the issue of Government\'s default as regards Income\n\ntax, persons may contend that funds earmarked as  subsidy\n\nfor Tertiary Education had to be used as  " bail outs"  for\n\nfailed Private Sector organisations, managed by individuals who are products\n\nof our University.\n They may maintain the view that students may take free education for\n\ngrant and that people usually show more interest in something when they have\n\na  " stake"  in it.\n Notwithstanding the positives associated with free Tertiary Education\n\nfar outweigh the negatives. \n\n  In conclusion: members of the society have pledged monies, from\n\ntheir salaries and wages, towards education and expect that the government\n\nwill deliver.\n\n\n ought   to invest in them by    providing\n\n  free Tertiary Education.\n A fully subsidized University Education may suggest a more qualified\n\nworkforce  . \n which translates a\n\nsound Educational foundation.\n The foregoing supports the view that Jamaican University Students\n\nshould not pay fees for their Education.  \n\n\n\n  Title of Essay: University students in Jamaica should not pay\n\nfor their education.  \n\n  Education is the training of minds or abilities.\n The acquisition of education usually begins at an early stage in a\n\nchild\'s life, progressing from kindergarten through to University.\n At this stage, students receive training appropriate to their\n\nacademic abilities, which generally pave the way for their career path.\n\n\noften times   oftentimes   , a fee is charged for education.\n The question therefore arises, should University students, in\n\nJamaica, be required to pay for their education?\n The answer to the question is not as simple as one might think since\n\nseveral factors need to be taken into consideration:- \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  status has in most instances,\n\ndetermined the    privileges   which are\n\naccessible to each class.\n\n\n privileges    which depends on the social standing.\n\n\nprivileged   families will be able to attend university, and later on\n\npursue an occupation that confers both prestige and high income.\n privileged\n\n  families, who are intellectually capable, may find that they have\n\nto settle for menial jobs which may barely cover expenses for their basic\n\nneeds let alone further education.\n There is hardly any scope for further advancement in these\n\ncircumstances and therefore University hopes might just be a passing dream.\n\n\n\n  Universities usually exist to provide students with the best\n\nquality education  geared at making more efficient\n\nindividuals for the job market.\n With this in mind, the most appropriate environment is necessary to\n\nfoster good learning.\n Visual aids, spacious & comfortable classrooms, security, and\n\nutilities are just a few of the areas in which funds must be diverted.\n These overheads require some sources of income, with school fees\n\nbeing the most readily available source. \n\n  The state of the economy also determines what portion, if any,\n\nthe government will absorb.\n For instance, the Government of Jamaica has subsidised the cost of\n\neducation at the University of the West Indies.\n This has enabled more students in a wider cross-section of society to\n\nbe able to afford education.\n The granting of subsidies enables students to further their education\n\nwhether it be full-time or part-time ( while income is being earned).\n However, the problem still exists where a large majority of the\n\npopulation is still unable to afford University education. \n\n  In order for the institutions to survive, administrative and\n\nother expenses need to be covered.\n If Government assistance is not adequate, then the students input\n\nmight be the most appropriate source.\n After all, they might argue, students are the ones who reap the\n\nbenefit, and sacrifices must be made.\n Education is supposed to be a free good yet it is difficult to\n\nseparate the inequalities that exist where it is concerned.  \n\n\n\n  Jamaican University students should not be required to pay\n\nfees for their Education  \n\n  \'Jamaican University\n\nstudents should not be required to pay fees for their Education\'  .\n I think they should be required to pay, the question is how much they\n\nshould be required to pay.\n There are several reasons I take this position such as the fact that\n\nsomebody will have to pay for it, if the students don\'t and if students are\n\nrequired to pay they will more than likely work harder and make more use of\n\ntheir university education.\n Another reason why I disagree with the statement, is that practically\n\neverywhere else in the world, if not everywhere students are required to pay\n\nfor their University education, so why should Jamaican students be treated\n\nspecially. \n\n  required\n\nto pay for their education, then more than likely the Jamaican government\n\nwould have to pay for it.\n I do not think it would be right for the government to have to spend\n\nall that money paying for student education, when there is so much need for\n\nthe money to be spent on such things as hospitals, poverty, alleviation\n\nschemes and to build and repair roads in the country.\n There is also the fact that government can not afford to pay for the\n\ntertiary education of all Jamaican students.\n This is because a University education is very expensive and for the\n\ngovernment to pay for all of it would cost a lot of money.\n The government more than likely could not afford to pay for the\n\nuniversity education of all Jamaican students at this time, even if it wanted\n\nto.\n This is because the government already has a large budget deficit and\n\nhas to be borrowing billions of dollars both locally and internationally and\n\nto pay for the complete education of Jamaican University student, would  mean the government would have to  borrow\n\neven more money to finance it. \n\n \n\nstudents</- > education as students only pay a\n\nsmall percentage.\n I think if students are going to get the benefit of a University\n\neducation they should be required to sacrifice something financially.\n\n\nprivilege   and benefit to be a University student, and if you are\n\ngoing to    receive   this    privilege   , you should be required to sacrifice something.\n Also if students have to pay for their University education, they\n\nwould probably work harder thus achieving much more and making more use of\n\ntheir University education.\n paid\n\n  for, they would not take their education very seriously as they\n\nwould not be sacrificing anything. \n\n  Also there is already a system in place which guarantees that\n\nstudent who can not afford it, but have the ability will still be able to get\n\na University education.\n This is because there is a student loan scheme in place to help those\n\nwho can not afford it.  \n\n\n\n  Question: Jamaican Should not be allowed to pay for tuition.\n\n \n\n  nationals of the\n\ncountry, Jamaican students should not be allowed to pay fees for their\n\nEducation; while on the other hand some would totally agree with the proposal\n\nshould one be  announced.\n that both\n\nsides of the situation have to be evaluated before one can take a stance.\n\n\n\n  There are many reasons why I think Jamaican students should be\n\nallowed to pay tuition.\n Firstly, they should be allowed to pay their tuition so as to ease\n\nthe financial strain on the government\'s budget.\n\n\n  may be   due to various factors such as\n\nmisappropriation of funds, low production and the destabilizing Jamaican\n\ndollar.\n governments\n\n government programmes and to meet the demand of the economy.\n This financial constraints causes the government to seek financial\n\naids from first world  countries to finance planned\n\nprogrammes.\n This results in accumulation of debts by the government.\n should be allowed to pay\n\ntheir tuition as it would greatly eased the financial contraint on the\n\ngovernment. \n\n  Secondly, if Students are allowed to pay for their tuition they\n\nwould be  more appreciative\n\nand value their achievements more.\n They would seek to obtain as much as they can from the system and\n\ndon\'t take it for granted as they did in the 1980\'s when they had    so-called   Free Education for all.\n advantages many\n\nstudents waited  their opportunity.\n\n\nthat is provided by the government is free and hence they    presumptuously   abused the system. \n\n  Thirdly, much consideration should be given to the fact that the\n\ngovernment has subsidized education to some extent.\n This is done in the form of cost sharing and other financial aid in\n\nprimary and secondary schools and also  teritiary  level where ( 83%)\n\neighty three percent of the tuition is  paid  by the government.\n I think that as students we should be responsible enough to keep our\n\nend of the bargain by paying the minimal balance that is asked of us to pay.\n\n\n\n  On the other hand Jamaican students should not be allowed to pay\n\ntuition due to various reasons.\n Firstly, it is the responsibility of the government of the country to\n\nprovide quality education for the citizens.\n has a\n\nright to obtain education irrespective of their social status.', 'subdomain':

{'text': 'Jamaican University Students should not be required to pay\n\nfees for their Education  \n\n  Even up to this point in time the question of Jamaican University\n\nstudents paying for their education is a burning issue. \n\n  The background from which this topical issue was developed is the\n\nfact that many of our counterparts from other Caribbean countries enjoy the\n\nbenefit of free university Education.\n \x1cWhy should we be required to pay, when\n\nTrinidadians don\'t, when Barbadians don\'t and many others don\'t?\x1c \n No doubt their arguments are reasonable.\n What is even more disturbing is the fact that the fees charged are not\n\nmoderate  but  absolutely    exorbitant \n\n .\n It is frightening to learn that some concern individuals are of the\n\nopinion that this is a deliberate attempt to prevent the mass of people from\n\nattaining an education that will guarantee them a share of the    scarce   benefits available. \n\n  But why should Jamaicans not pay?\n Is it fair to demand of taxpayers to pay for people\'s highest level of\n\neducation, when they have been doing so for primary and Secondary Education\n\nand in some cases Tertiary?\n No doubt some students will say that their money is in the tax pool\n\nsince no one can truly say that he or she is exempted from paying taxes.\n This will now force us to ask, What percentage of taxpayers is\n\nentering the university?\n\n\n  It seems then that the logical way to address this issue is to\n\nask the students to pay a part of their fees and let the state pay the other\n\npart.  \n\n\n\n  Jamaican university students should\n\nnot be required to pay fees for their education.  \n\n  Entrance into the University of the West Indies at the Mona\n\nCampus is a very trying time.\n This is because there is the limited time period for registration in\n\nwhich courses have to be chosen and fees must be paid.\n During this time the payment of fees is foremost in the minds of the\n\nparents whose children are entering the university.\n Under normal circumstances Jamaican students should pay fees for\n\ntheir education,  however there are also circumstances\n\nin which Jamaican students should not pay fees for their education. \n\n  The University of the West Indies has a budget comprised of\n\nschool fees which is used to finance the school.\n This budget is used to pay utility bills along with salaries and\n\nother expenses.\n\n\nan education because if Jamaican students did not pay then where would the\n\nmoney come from.\n This non-payment of fees would also be unfair to students who come\n\nfrom other countries in the Caribbean to attend the Jamaican campus of the\n\nUniversity.\n It would be unfair because those students would then have to bear the\n\nfull costs of the University. \n\n  Jamaican students on the other hand should not be required to\n\n pay fees for their education only if there were special\n\ncircumstances.\n One such circumstance would be if Jamaican students were qualified to\n\ngain such benefits as scholarships and bursaries then this non-payment of\n\nfees could be accepted.\n However, this circumstance could not only be applicable to Jamaican\n\nstudents but also to nationals of other Caribbean countries. \n\n  If the University of the West Indies was a government grant aided\n\nschool  in which the school was subsidized by the\n\ngovernment then could the university exempt Jamaican students from paying\n\nfees.\n However this would also have to be applicable to nationals of other\n\nCaribbean countries in which the other two university campuses    are   situated.\n This non-payment of fees could only be facilitated with government\n\nhelp because if the nationals of the islands in which campuses are situated\n\ndid not pay fees then such things as school supplies could not be paid for.\n\n\n\n  Under normal circumstances Jamaican students should pay fees and\n\nunder other circumstances the non-payment of fees would have to apply also to\n\nnationals of other Caribbean countries where there are University campuses.\n\n \n\n\n\n  : Jamaican university students should not be\n\nrequired to pay fees to attend university.  \n\n  Though vital to existence of a society, tertiary level education\n\nshould have its price.\n The pursuit of academic learning is of utmost importance to the\n\nexistence of any society.\n Education, and more specifically tertiary or university level\n\neducation is the source of economic growth and social changes for any nation.\n "\n\nemancipate yourself from mental slavery"  in very practical ways.\n It empowers you to become independent, productive, resourceful,\n\ninnovative, creative and socially well adjusted members of society.\n As a developing country Jamaica cannot afford to provide free\n\ntertiary level education.\n Free university education implies removing resources from other\n\neconomic sectors as well as other levels of education.\n Still for some, the sacrifices made to acquire a university education\n\nmotivates them to aspire for excellence. \n\n  nations\n\n nation that wishes to achieve economic growth and by extension,\n\nimprove the standard of living of its citizens.\n As a developing nation, Jamaica must allocate its limited and already\n\nstretched resources in the most efficient way possible.\n Economic constraints confront us; a contracting economy,\n\nunemployment, financial sector problems, both government and private sector\n\ninefficiencies, just to name a few.\n Hence, the Jamaican economy cannot afford the full economic cost of\n\nproviding its university population with the option of free education.\n Implicit in the notion of free tertiary education is the fact that\n\nresources must be redistributed.\n\n\ncapitalized health sector, public investments, the manufacturing and\n\nproductive sectors; vital sectors upon which the life of our economy depends.\n Investment in human capital is indeed critical to development but\n\ncannot by itself generate development.\n Even countries that are referred to as developed countries, such as\n\nthe United States of America and Canada  do not\n\nprovide free university education. \n\n  In this fiscal year the government has allocated 15.6 billion\n\nJamaican dollars to the education sector of which 2.6 billion is allotted for\n\ntertiary education ( The Gleaner, April 27, 1998).\n Is 13 billion dollars adequate funding for primary and secondary\n\nlevel education?\n At the beginning of the school year one local newspaper carried\n\nnumerous reports of the cost to parents of funding their    children\'s   education at these levels.\n The September 4, 1998 issue of the Gleaner carried an article\n\nattesting to the fact that there were  " reports from some principals\n\nof an increase in parents applying for assistance with school fees." \n The implementation of measures such as the shift system because of\n\nlimited infrastructure is designed to give more students the opportunity to\n\nbenefit from education at the secondary level.\n This puts a strain on the already meager resources allocated to the\n\neducation sector.\n If therefore, the sector is strapped for enough cash to adequately\n\nsupport primary and secondary level education, how then can it afford free\n\ntertiary education?\n As we grapple with the realities of our educational system at these\n\nlevels, high cost, illiteracy, poor infrastructure it is imperative that we\n\nanalyze and decide accordingly where the need is greatest.\n Who will benefit from free university education when we produce\n\nilliterate and academically incompetent school leavers at the primary and\n\nsecondary levels.\n The provision of affordable and even free education must be\n\nadequately addressed at these basic very important levels. \n\n  Paying for a university education also has a psychological effect\n\non many of our university students.\n The sacrifice that some students make in order to acquire a\n\nuniversity education creates in them a sense of responsibility.\n Responsibility to themselves, to their parents, to all those who make\n\nsacrifices on their behalf to provide them with the opportunity of getting a\n\nuniversity education.\n It motivates and inspires students to work hard and to achieve\n\nexcellence.\n The price students pay to attend university eliminates the tendency\n\nto settle for mediocrity both in their own performances and from our tertiary\n\ninstitutions.\n The hard work, the discipline, the sacrifices will truly be valued\n\nwhen a monetary price is paid to attend universities.\n " that which is free is never usually\n\nappreciated."  \n\n  Though burdensome we must all aspire to get a university\n\neducation.\n There are opportunities provided, the revolving student loan fund,\n\ngovernment and private scholarships, church and community initiatives,\n\ncontributions from the business sector of which we must avail ourselves.\n Inadequate as these may be, they do help in defraying some of the\n\nmonetary cost associated with attending a university in Jamaica.\n as free university tuition is, the\n\nfact is as a developing nation paying the full economic cost of providing\n\nsuch an amenity is not one that can be afforded.\n Until our educational system begins to provide affordable and quality\n\neducation at the primary and secondary levels we cannot even begin to\n\nconsider free university tuition.\n The value of a university education cannot be quantified in monetary\n\nterms, however it should and does motivate students and tertiary institutions\n\nto settle for nothing less than the best.  \n\n\n\n  Topic: Jamaican University student should not be required to\n\npay fees for their education.  \n\n Date of Submission: September 21, 1998. \n\n  Education is defined as the acquisition of knowledge and the\n\nlearning of skills, while a university is described as being an educational\n\ninstitution for advance learning.\n The opportunity to pursue a university education is therefore a\n\nsignificant one.\n This opportunity can be very costly for some Jamaican students.\n This is because the fees they are required to pay are relatively\n\nhigh. \n\n  However, even though these fees are high, they are important in\n\nthe operation of the university.\n Fees help to offset some of the cost that the institution incur from\n\nproviding the service of educating the students.\n These costs may vary depending on the programme taken by the student.\n Fees are therefore set against this background.\n An example of this is that if a student is pursuing a degree in\n\nnatural sciences he or she may need to carry out various experiments which\n\nmust be provided for in the fees that the student pays.\n The fees are also used to cover the cost of various printed material\n\nwhich the students may be given during the course of the school year. \n\n  Another important reason why students should be required to pay\n\nfees for their university education is the level of professional assistance\n\nthat is received at this stage.\n At the university students require more advance professional help,\n\nand this must, therefore, be provided by some of the best professionals in\n\nthe various areas of studies.\n These persons need to be paid for their expertise and the time that\n\nthey devote to the students, and the fees paid  by the\n\nstudents is a means of paying for  this level of professional\n\nhelp that could not otherwise be paid for. \n\n  The paying of fees by students often act as a means of motivating\n\nstudents to work hard at university.\n This is because when students realize the sacrifice that either they\n\nor their parent have to make for them to get a university education this will\n\nencourage them to work hard.\n These same students may not have been motivated to work hard if they\n\nwere given a free education.\n The students may also take into consideration that if they fail they\n\nwill be required to pay these high fees again for the same course, this also\n\nacts as a motivation for hard work at this level of education.\n If students are required to pay fees for their education it may also\n\nhelp to give them a sense of responsibility. \n\n  If students were not required to pay for their university\n\neducation they would probably be bounded to give some sort of voluntary\n\nservice to the country.\n This idea may not be readily accepted by some students.\n It can also be argued that if persons are not bound to give voluntary\n\nservice then they should be required to pay for their university education.\n\n\n\n  Therefore, given the cost and the level of professional help that\n\nit is needed at  this level, I strongly believe that Jamaican\n\nuniversity students should be required to pay fees for their education.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '2208e0a1-fde5-40d9-b320-81469ebdfd41', 'added':

{'text': 'Jamaican University students should not be required to pay\n\nfees for their education.  \n\n \n\n  Education can be defined as the act or process by which knowledge\n\nis acquired or imparted.\n The process develops the powers of reasoning and judgement and\n\ngenerally prepares one or others intellectually for mature life or a\n\nprofession.\n Education is the foundation of a nation as it produces a skilled and\n\neducated workforce which contributes to society as a whole.\n It can be seen undoubtedly that education has a function.\n In Jamaica, however education is not made free of cost to university\n\nstudents, this is so because considering our economic status it is\n\nimpractical and impossible to do so. \n\n  Jamaica is a third world country whose economic status is unstable\n\nand insufficient to fund education totally.\n In our country we have greater social problems such as crime which are\n\nnow on the rise and therefore where funding or political legislation is\n\nconcentrating now.\n It then goes to show that the country is trying to correct and\n\nimprove more direct social problems and therefore can\'t and is unable to\n\nprovide university education free of cost, especially at this point in time\n\nwhere other areas or sectors in society and economy need to be improved\n\nrapidly. \n\n  To make up for this the government through the university\n\nprovides some form of subsidy in the means of school loans, scholarships and\n\nawards to outstanding students who strive for achievement.\n This is the most the government can do at this point in time\n\nconsidering its capabilities, and its intentions are acceptable and should be\n\ngreatly appreciated. \n\n  It can also be said that if the government should provide\n\nuniversity education free of cost, so too should primary or basic education\n\nbe free of cost.\n Primary or basic school education is even in more need because there\n\nare many poor or desolate parents with willing children who hope for the\n\nopportunity to get an education but due to a lack of funds are left to idle.\n At least most university students are better off because most of them\n\nare working people and the others have reached some acceptable level and are\n\nlegible to work.\n Primary education more so than university education requires\n\ngovernment funding, so that education at this initial stage is of no cost to\n\npoor parents and children are given this vital opportunity. \n\n  The government can still be blamed to an extent for the fact that\n\neducation is not free at any level.\n It can be seen that the government misallocates and misuses public\n\nrevenue or income in Jamaica, resulting in the downfall and economic crisis\n\nthat is now widespread from the common man to the largest business\n\ncorporation.\n The government needs to be more responsible and efficient in the\n\nallocation of the country\'s income and resources and budget prioritising\n\neducation starting at the primary level.\n Hopefully by the next decade it is seen that primary and university\n\neducation are totally subsidised and free of cost  .   \n\n\n\n  Jamaican students Should not pay fees for their education\n\n \n\n  Education may be described as the process of training and\n\ndeveloping of the knowledge, skill, mind and character.\n This is achieved through formal schooling, teaching and\n\ntraining. \n\n  The educational process could be a life long one, if one wishes\n\nto attain the highest level at all times throughout one\'s productive years.\n Education is an important investment to a country as well as to\n\nthe individual citizens.\n Educated people make better political choices as they are better able\n\nto analyse issues presented to them which are important to their future.\n For a country like Jamaica that seeks foreign investment, an\n\neducated workforce can be an attraction for foreign investors.\n Education could be the means by which individuals improve their\n\nsocioeconomic state and escape a life of poverty.\n In some countries, the educational costs are borne by the state and\n\nso present no charge to parents except through payment of income and other\n\ntaxes. \n\n  Educational costs in Jamaica are high at all levels especially at\n\nthe tertiary level.\n For the University of the West Indies fees range in excess of\n\n$200000 per annum which are quite outside the means of the average working\n\nclass  person. \n\n  Since education is an investment, persons pursuing it should be\n\nready to take responsibility for financing it bearing in mind that the\n\ngreatest return on this investment is theirs.\n Jamaica is not in a healthy financial state to bear the cost of\n\neducation at the University level.\n one word\n\n</unclear>  first of all plan for tertiary level education and use all\n\nchannels open to them to meet the costs  involved. \n Revolving Loan\n\nScheme, Credit Unions, Scholarships.\n For those students still unable to acquire support through the above,\n\ntheir financial situation should be thoroughly evaluated by the Ministry of\n\nEducation.\n Based on their need financial support should be offered and annual\n\nevaluation done to ensure that a satisfactory level of performance is\n\nmaintained throughout the period of study.  \n\n\n\n  Jamaican University students should not be\n\nrequired to pay for their education. Discuss.   \n\n \n\n  A university education is a very precious commodity, however,\n\nmany are excluded from using this commodity because of the great expense\n\nassociated with a university education.\n This is exceptionally true in Jamaica, where approximately\n\ntwenty-five percent of the population is living below the poverty line.\n Because so many are deprived the right to a university education\n\nbecause of their financial background; many people hold the view that\n\nJamaican university students should not be required to pay for their\n\neducation.\n But is it logical to say that university students should not be\n\nrequired to pay for their education?\n Where will the funding come from to run the University?\n Is it fair to expect that the government of Jamaica fund the\n\nuniversities totally on their own when they cannot provide crucial services\n\nthat the majority of the Jamaican population needs for their daily life? \n\n  It is ludicrous to believe that a university education should be\n\noffered free of charge to Jamaican students.\n .\n As it is the University of the West Indies ( where most of the\n\nJamaican university students are enrolled) is   \n\nunderfunded   .\n Also, at present all students of the University of the West Indies\n\nare required to pay high fees for their education.\n For example, students in the Faculty of the Social Sciences are\n\nrequired to pay a fee close to sixty thousand Jamaican dollars per year for\n\ntheir education.\n The fees in other faculties are, in most cases, higher than the fees\n\nin the Faculty of the Social Sciences.\n If university education was to be offered free of charge to Jamaican\n\nstudents then the universities would lose the majority of their funding which\n\nthe Jamaican government could not afford to supplement.\n This would cause the quality of education offered by the universities\n\nto decline. \n\n  If the quality of the education offered was to fall then that\n\nwould have detrimental effects on Jamaica. If the education offered in\n\nJamaica was to worsen then more students would opt to further their studies\n\nabroad.\n \'brain drain\'\n\n .\n This would negatively affect Jamaica as Jamaica would lose many of\n\ntheir professionals. \n\n  Those that support the view that Jamaican students should not be\n\nrequired to pay for their education, hold the view that it would affect\n\nJamaica positively rather than negatively.\n They believe that free university education would help to build up\n\nthe number of people in the work force that hold professional degrees.\n At present, the reason so few Jamaican students have a tertiary level\n\neducation is that they cannot afford the fees, and provisions for students\n\nloans are insufficient.\n If university were free then more Jamaicans would have university\n\ndegrees. \n\n  However, it would be best to come to a compromise.\n The government cannot fully pay for the university education of\n\nJamaican students neither can university students expect to attend university\n\nfree of charge.\n A good compromise could be that university education be heavily\n\nsubsidized by the government.\n That would allow for the reduction of university fees for the\n\nstudents, without reducing the revenue of the universities.\n This would therefore allow for the maximization of all resources both\n\nhuman and monetary.  \n\n\n\n  JAMAICAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO\n\nPAY FEES FOR THEIR EDUCATION   \n\n \n\n  defined by the Diamond\n\nCollins Thesaurus is training,    development \n\n or cultivation, schooling, informing and  rearing  .\n The term required can also be replaced by the term begged, ordered,\n\ndemanded, requested or needed. \n\n  The Cost of university education in Jamaica is at an all time\n\nhigh.\n Individuals upon gaining acceptance at the university are forced to\n\naccess funds through the local borrowing institution - The \n\nloan Bureau.\n this institution is only equipped to grant\n\nloans to approximately thirty-seven percent of applications received.\n Approximately fifty percent of this number are university students.\n It can be therefore said that approximately two-thirds of the\n\nuniversity population are forced to pay   \n\nexorbitant   fees for their education.\n Considering the cost of living in this country, many students are\n\ndeprived this educational opportunity. \n\n  University students should not be required to pay fees for their\n\neducation.\n Jamaican citizens are forced to live on meagre incomes which are in\n\nmost cases inadequate to satisfy their basic needs such as Clothing and\n\nshelter.\n They are therefore unable to save a part of their earnings towards\n\nthe cost of education at the university level. \n\n  In order to promote technological advancement, university\n\neducation in Jamaica should be free.\n the need to import\n\nthe services of well educated lecturers as Jamaica would be able to utilize\n\nits own resources.\n Individuals with the aptitude and ability to be great scientists,\n\nsurgeons, professors etc are sometimes denied the opportunity to study at the\n\nuniversity level as the fees are unaffordable.\n Some have even commenced their course of study but were unable to\n\nfinish. \n\n  Many teachers, especially at the pre-school level have minimal\n\neducation;

{'text': ": Jamaican University\n\nstudents should not be required to pay fees.  \n\n  '\n\n98  . \n\n  Parents and most Jamaican university students, if not all, would\n\nwelcome this policy should it be put into effect.\n Is this measure healthy for the Jamaican society?\n We must analyse whether or not such measures would achieve the\n\nultimate goals of the University; to equip individuals with the means to\n\nfunction in today's rapidly changing society. \n\n  One of the most positive effects of such measure is the increase\n\nin the number of students able to    receive\n\ntertiary   level education.\n Statistically, approximately 7% percent of the Jamaican population\n\nattend the University, limited financial resources being the main\n\ncontributing factor.\n It shows that a great percentage of the population is marginalised.\n No fee payments would greatly reduce this marginalization.\n\n \n\n  run, indirect effect would be an\n\nincrease in the economic development of Jamaica.\n &triangle; &asterisk; Among the additional number of students would\n\nbe individuals who are not only intelligent but  good\n\nthinkers.\n Hence is produced economist, government leaders, scientist and like\n\nprofessions that will have an input into the Jamaican society to increase its\n\neconomy and achieve higher standards of living. \n\n  The need for government scholarships would no longer exists on a\n\nlarge scale.\n Therefore revenue that was placed toward education in that area can\n\nbe rechanneled to other sectors of the economy. \n\n  Unfortunately, however, the Mona University needs finances in\n\norder to function and continue its  existence.\n paid by its\n\nstudents.\n Denied of this source of revenue the University will be unable to\n\nsupply many of the facilities and equipment presently provided at the\n\ninstitution. \n\n  number of teachers\n\nemployed will occur because of the inability to pay wages.\n This means that there are less professors and larger classes.\n Their lecture schedules become tighter and the quality of their\n\nteaching reduces.\n\n\n  Furthermore, students will take their education for granted.\n there\n\nare students who are delinquent with regards to their studies.\n This attitude would further increase should such a policy become\n\neffective. \n\n  Finally, more likely than not, fees for non-Jamaican university\n\nstudents will drastically increase.\n As a result, the number of foreign students attending the institution\n\ndecreases.\n Not only will it decrease but contention can arise among foreign\n\nstudents desiring to attend but unable to do so.\n This contention may then surpass the students level and go into a\n\ngovernmental level in which great debates arise concerning tertiary level\n\neducation system in the Caribbean, especially Jamaica.\n\n\n  Considering the above arguments it is perhaps, hardly likely that\n\nJamaican students would not be required to pay fees.\n Nevertheless, the fact remains that the University seeks to attain a\n\nhigh level of education and service, and  to maintain\n\na reputable standard.\n As was previously mentioned, it seeks to create well rounded\n\nindividuals to deal with today's society.\n the University must maintain\n\nthese ideals.  \n\n\n\n  Jamaican University Students Should\n\nNot Be Required To Pay Fees For Their Education.  \n\n \n\n  'Jamaican university\n\nstudents should not be required to pay fees for their education'  .\n Education is costly.\n Materials, equipment, facilities and personnel used in the process of\n\neducating, has to be paid for.\n I believe that those who will reap the most benefits from the\n\nprocess, should be the ones to pay for it.\n The student will benefit most directly from a university education,\n\nthen his/her family and then the society.\n\n\n  The aim of the government should be to make tertiary education\n\naccessible to all economic classes of the society.\n Qualification should be based solely on academics.\n Financial status should not be a factor.\n To make this really happen, a new policy needs to be implemented.\n loan system would have to be amended.\n A policy like the one I am about to outline, might be more efficient.\n\n\n\n  The government would require that all workers pay a minimum of\n\nten dollars from each salary or wage collected, to a Tertiary Education Fund.\n Each person accepted to university should pay whatever portion\n\nof the fee they can.\n If they cannot pay it all, then the government pays the rest,\n\nusing money from the college fund and other sources. For each ten percent\n\npaid by the government, the recipient is bonded to work in Jamaica for\n\none year.\n So if, for example, the government pays fifty percent of John Brown's\n\nfees, John has to work in Jamaica for at least five years on completion of\n\nhis studies. \n\n  The percentage paid by the government would be calculated\n\nfor the full period of study.\n If John did a three-year programme, his percentage paid by the\n\ngovernment would be; \n\n \n\n &line;  \n\n \n\n \n\n  In addition to being bonded, the recipients of government\n\nassistance would be required to repay the government at a rate of\n\ninterest slightly lower than that of commercial banks.\n These two stipulations should deter those who do not need assistance\n\nfrom taking it.\n The policy would however make it easier for the poorest Jamaicans to\n\nattend university, and eventually pay for the benefit. \n\n  Jamaican university students should pay for their education\n\nbecause they stand to gain the most from it.\n However, there should be a better system which allows those who\n\ncannot pay for it  'now'  to get it on  'credit'\n\n .  \n\n\n\n  Jamaican University Students should not be required to\n\npay fees for their education   \n\n  Education can mean many different things.\n You can learn from books, television, radio, newspaper and\n\npictures, just to name a few.\n Anything that you learn is a part of your education even talking to\n\nother persons.\n Formal education is said to be education that you get in school or\n\nthe University, while learning outside of the class-room is called informal\n\neducation. \n\n  In Jamaica the formal education cycle of an individual starts\n\nwith attending basic or pre  -  preparatory school from the age of two\n\nyears to four years.\n This is followed by preparatory school from four years to ten, at\n\nwhich time the child would sit the Common Entrance Examinations.\n can cost\n\napproximately Two Hundred Thousand Dollars (\n\n$200,000.00) inclusive. \n\n  On being successful the child will spend another five years in\n\nhigh school, at which point he/she will be required to sit the CXC\n\nexaminations or the GCE Ordinary Level examinations where he/she is tested on\n\nseveral areas.\n At this level, school fees can cost approximately One Hundred\n\nThousand Dollars (\n\n$100,000.00).  This figure also includes the cost for examination\n\nfees. \n\n  are Advanced Level\n\nexaminations after which the individual will usually go on to university.\n\n\n\n  During these fifteen years of learning it can be observed that\n\nthe amounts that can be spent on tuition and examination fees are quite\n\nsubstantial.\n A family that has one child attending school may find this affordable\n\nbut when there are more children to support it can prove to be costly. \n\n  It is no wonder that at the stage of receiving tertiary education\n\nstudents should not be required to pay fees.\n It can be reasoned that prior to this a child has his\n\nparents/guardians as the provider and it will be the parent's responsibility\n\nto provide the fees.\n However, on reaching the age of eighteen years, young persons are\n\nusually unable to secure the funding necessary to pay for the tuition on\n\ntheir own.\n While these parents would not have deserted their children, it now\n\nbecomes quite burdensome to identify funds to pay the fees.\n It must be remembered that in addition to fees, funds are also\n\nrequired to purchase school books and other tools necessary to be successful\n\nin a course of study. \n\n  On supporting the statement further, that University students\n\nshould not pay fees, the government of the country should ensure that enough\n\nis budgeted each year for tertiary education bearing in mind the number of\n\npupils that can be accommodated in the institution each year, as well as the\n\npersons that will be paid to manage the institution. \n\n  It can be recommended however, that having gone through tertiary\n\nlevel education, it should be mandatory that graduates should give back\n\nsomething to the community.\n This could be free hours in tutoring either at the University or at a\n\nhigh school or free medical service to a hospital or clinic.\n The general idea should be that whatever area of speciality you\n\npracticed, there should be the opportunity for this expertise to be given\n\nback to the community free of cost. \n\n  This practice could certainly benefit the nation as one of the\n\nmost pressing problems within countries today is the lack of education for\n\nits people  .  \n\n  Jamaica could be the role model by not allowing students within\n\nthe University to pay fees for their education  .   \n\n\n\n  JAMAICAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO PAY\n\nFEES FOR EDUCATION.  \n\n  Whether Jamaican University students should pay for education or\n\nshould not pay for education has been a much debated topic for many years\n\nnow.\n With many coming to the conclusion that fees must not be paid and\n\nsome with the conclusion that fees must be paid. \n\n  It would almost be unfair to the government and to Jamaica if the\n\ncost of education was totally financed out of tax       money, because then it would mean that everyone else\n\nwould have to bear the  'burden'  of paying for school fees\n\nwhile the main beneficiary, the student, pays little or nothing. \n\n  If it was by some means decided that Jamaican students should not\n\npay fees, this could automatically represents a even greater strain on the\n\ngovernment's already unstable budget and it would also add even greater\n\nweight on our already depressed society, because then the government would\n\nhave to find ways and means of financing and the easiest mean of finance is\n\nby increasing taxes, this, however, would not place our society in a better\n\nposition than before. \n\n  While free tertiary education seems to be a unwise move, there\n\nare those students who just cannot afford the  high cost of\n\nattaining a tertiary education and these students are being totally deprived\n\nof a higher level of education or the chance of making themselves better\n\nindividuals.\n It seems to be very contradicting for a country to continue advertise\n\nthat education is the key while fees for some faculties of U.W.I.  has increased by more than sixty percent and then the government\n\ndecided that money that could be used to further subsidise the cost of\n\neducation, was sent abroad to purchase a football for almost  ten million dollars.\n It would, therefore, seem that the country is saying one thing and\n\ndoing another.\n For students, like myself, who has lost both parents and then to have\n\nmy application for a loan declined, this would be a very hard thing for me to\n\naccept, but I still have to accept it.\n g\n\n  high school fees. \n\n  While it would be very hard for Jamaican students to receive free\n\neducation, I surely do think that the cost of education could be much lower.\n If this is not done the country will be returning to those days when\n\nonly the rich could afford education and the poorer class of students will\n\nhave nothing to do.\n One of the easiest way the government or this country can lower the\n\ncost of education so that it is affordable to each and everyone, is if the\n\nimportance of football is replaced by the importance of education, then we\n\nwould see money coming from all angle to finance the cost of education.\n Therefore, the importance of tertiary education will have to be seen\n\nby deeds and not only by words.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

problem of\n\ninequality of educational opportunity at the University. \n\n  Based on these inequities Jamaican University Students should not\n\nbe required to pay fees for their education.  \n\n\n\n  Jamaican students ( University) should not be required to pay\n\nfor their education  \n\n \n\nfor all in the 1970\'s, there has always been a debate as to whether or not\n\nuniversity students should pay school fees.\n In the current system students pay fifteen percent of their fees\n\nwhile the government pays the other eighty-five percent.\n If all things are taken into consideration, it becomes clear that the\n\nfifteen per cent is not an unreasonable amount for a student to pay. \n\n  An institute of higher education such as a University has certain\n\nneeds and amenities which require a large sum of money.\n Not only do lecturers and tutors have to be paid but also\n\nadministrative staff and grounds personal.\n The amount of people employed by a university is similar to that of a\n\nfirm.\n Also buildings have to be repaired and furniture maintained.\n The Water bill and cost of electricity are another matter in itself.\n Jamaica being a small third world country, with many economic issues\n\nin need of urgent address,  leads to a need for students to\n\npay some of the cost of their education. \n\n  Another factor that needs to be taken into consideration is the\n\nearning potential of a Degree.\n Basically what this means is that in a few years after a degree is\n\nobtained one would see it paying for itself.\n The leverage one gains once they have a degree and advantage allows\n\nthe individual to regain the money once in the field of work. \n\n  The flexibility of payment also needs to be considered.\n In the present system one does not have to pay all their fees at\n\nonce.\n payed\n\n  paid   at the beginning of  each semester.\n\n\n in one   " lump sum"  but can be\n\n   paid   in halves, this makes it more\n\naffordable and  reasonable on the student. \n\n \n\n  cannot   afford the fees, and they should not\n\nhave to  do without   a\n\nchance for advancement.\n In these cases government agencies such as the Student Loan Bureau\n\nare necessary.\n They will provide the student with the finances needed to secure a\n\nDegree.\n a payment plan is arranged.\n There are also scholarship boards which give student scholarships\n\nbased on academic ability.\n These merely need to broaden their scope and take financial need into\n\nconsideration. \n\n  With enough thought and consideration, it becomes clear that\n\nthere is no reason why Jamaican students should not pay for their university\n\neducation.  \n\n\n\n  Jamaican university students should not be required to\n\npay fees for their education.   \n\n \n\n  The new education policy emphasizes that Government has\n\nrecognized that education has to be given a higher priority than has been the\n\ncase over the last decade.\n Education is critical to the development of the country, hence, the\n\ncomprehensive education policy and the decision to increase the financial\n\nresources allocated to education.\n In order to educate a wider cross-section of society at the tertiary\n\nlevel, Government should rethink its position and once again make education\n\n " free"  to Jamaican students at the university level. \n\n  education\n\nhave merits, however, let us give preference to  " free" \n\neducation.\n human\n\nbeings.\n As stated in the Second- Generational Rights under the articles in\n\nthe UN Declaration, individuals are entitled to an education.\n The right to an education is also stated in the Constitutional Rights\n\nof the Child in the sense that one has to pay to \n\nreceive an education, it may be viewed as a   \n\nprivilege   rather than a right, not easily obtained by some.\n However, since education is a basic human right to which we are all\n\nentitled, Jamaican university students should not be required to pay fees in\n\norder to exercise this right. \n\n  for students to attend high\n\nschool for five years, but education like socialization is a lifelong process\n\nwhich cannot and should not be cut short. \n\n  The Jamaican economy is in a poor state.\n The society is faced with the inability to meet the financial\n\nrequirements of the university.\n More people are registering each academic year so expenses go up.\n In order to ensure that they have the infrastructure available to\n\nmeet population needs, such as library space and lecture theatres, as well as\n\nthe need to finance the additional administrative expenses such as staff to\n\nensure the efficient running of the institution, one can see the need to\n\ncharge tuition fees.\n However, the cost of living is constantly on the rise and with it\n\ntuition fees. \n\n  There is a limited market for high school graduates, so more\n\nyoung people are seeking to better equip themselves for the job market\n\nthrough higher education.\n The downturn in the economy has caused many parents who were once in\n\na position to finance their children\'s education unable to do so because of\n\nredundancy.\n Education is key if children are to be the future leaders of the\n\ncountry.\n " free"\n\n , more individuals would have an opportunity to pursue a university\n\ncareer providing more qualified individuals to fill jobs. \n\n  when then Prime Minister Manley\n\ndeclared education was  " free"  , many people who would not\n\nhave been able to afford a university education were able to do so.\n Today, many of these people are leaders in the various sectors.\n\n\nthe    practice   was discontinued. \n\n  Loan Bureau seeks to fill the gap but\n\nbecause of their limited resources they are unable to meet the demand for\n\nfinancing.\n\n\n  lead others not to apply. \n\n  Given the high level of taxes which is imposed, including an\n\neducation tax, the Government should use this to underwrite the cost of\n\neducation at the tertiary level rather than being included in the\n\nConsolidation Fund. \n\n  education for Jamaican university\n\nstudents is utopia unless the country\'s economy can be stabilized.\n Until then, persons wishing to pursue a university career will\n\ncontinue to pay    exorbitant   tuition\n\nfees or be forced to seek self-employment or minimum wage jobs. \n\n  Given the downturn in the job market and the quality of jobs\n\nwhich are available, the society must find a way to finance the education of\n\nits university students, as well as maintain its quality, as only through the\n\ncontributions of educated individuals can the country develop and grow. \n\n\n\n\n\n  JAMAICAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO\n\nPAY FEES FOR THEIR EDUCATION.   \n\n \n\n  The government of Jamaica is elected by the people to serve the\n\ninterests of the people.\n It is therefore submitted that the educational needs of the Jamaican\n\nstudent should be a priority with the Jamaican government. \n\n  The Government needs to prioritise its internal policies.\n In order for the country to improve its position on the international\n\narena, Jamaica needs to improve    its      infrastructure   and education is therefore a\n\nkey instrument.\n It is commendable that the country has gained international exposure\n\nfrom the Reggae Boyz success and even more praiseworthy is the interest that\n\nthe government has taken in sports.\n Now imagine if University education received half the attention, we\n\ncould also be known for our Universities and even attract foreign students.\n\n\n\n  The Jamaican economy is on a downward slope, like Japan and\n\nGermany was after World War II but they are now two of the    world\'s   most powerful nations largely due to their\n\ninvestment in education.\n\n\nparents are on a minimum wage salary to attend our universities when they can\n\nhardly afford the Jamaican high schools.\n Not only are university fees high but they are constantly being\n\nincreased.\n\n\n-  INDIES is unacceptable.\n Recent increases between 50-100% only further serves to marginalise\n\nthe poor from our tertiary institution as their economic situation often\n\nmakes it impossible for them to be able to afford the increases in tuition.\n\n\n\n \n\n afford university fees should not be required to pay.\n Not only are they being denied a tertiary education but they are also\n\nbeing denied the opportunity to improve their social and economic stratum.\n Education is one of the key factors to social mobility and in our\n\ndemocratic society should be accessible by all who desire it. \n\n  Education in Jamaica, even at the University level, is subsidised\n\nand compared to some United States University tuitions of up to\n\n$30,000 U.S. dollars are relatively low.\n However it does not take a genius to recognise that with the high\n\nstandard of living in Jamaica subsidised University education does not even\n\nbegin to solve the problem.\n The Government needs to increase the number of scholarships awarded\n\nto  \'A\'  level students.\n It is hard to believe that out of the thousands of students who sit\n\nthe  \'A\'  levels and are accepted to U.W.I. only five receive\n\nscholarships.\n In fact it is even harder to learn that the United States has given\n\nmore Jamaican students the opportunity to receive a need based scholarship\n\nthan the Jamaican Government. \n\n  In order for the university students to receive a free education\n\nthe Jamaican economy would have to go through a metamorphosis we would have\n\nto become a Utopian society as well as the societies around us.\n have free\n\nUniversities then how can we rationally expect a third world country like\n\nJamaica to do so.\n Free education at the university level is an ideology one supported\n\nby the Jamaican Labour Party.\n IF students were not required to pay university fees the money to\n\nmaintain the universities and to pay teachers and all other personnels, who\n\nkeep the university operational, would have to come from the national budget.\n This would mean less money being advocated to other areas of social\n\nlife such as health. \n\n  There has to be a compromise a standing middle ground.\n needs to fund\n\neducation more efficiently even if it means a pay cut for the Jamaican\n\nFootball    team\'s   Technical Director.\n rich or a poor family should\n\nbe given the opportunity to receive a higher education if

pay for the services of the teachers, a\n\nservice which should help them maintain a particular standard of living for\n\nthe rest of their lives.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM',

{'text': 'JAMAICAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO\n\nPAY FEES FOR THEIR EDUCATION.   \n\n  As the world becomes more competitive, persons within the society\n\nseek new ways in which they can make themselves more marketable.\n By doing so these persons are better able to withstand the harsh\n\nrealities of this world. \n\n  One such way in which this can be achieved is through education.\n By educating themselves, especially in levels well above the formative\n\nyears of an elementary and primary education, persons find themselves being\n\nmore viable on the job market. \n\n  In Jamaica the situation is similar, as more persons are enrolling\n\ninto tertiary institutions in the hopes of attaining some sense of job\n\nsecurity.\n The increase in the amount of redundancies has led to the belief that\n\nif a person were to be of a higher level of qualification, then the\n\nlikelihood that he/she would be laid off would be minimal.\n The more specialized a person is, the more secure he is with regards\n\nto his job.\n When the workforce of a country becomes more specialized, then the\n\neconomy will improve becoming more profitable and stable. \n\n  However, although persons may want to attain a higher education,\n\nthis may not always be possible for the average Jamaican.\n This is so as the tuition for both Universities located on the island\n\nand Universities worldwide, is viewed as being extremely expensive. This\n\nbeing so, forcibly excludes persons who are not in a position to afford these\n\nfees. \n\n  It has then been suggested that Jamaican University students\n\nshould not be required to pay their tuition fee.\n Instead the Government of Jamaica and/or the private sector should\n\nmake available the necessary funds to offset these fees. \n\n  The argument that has been presented to support this is the fact\n\nthat having a specialized workforce would be an investment that the\n\ngovernment and the private sector would benefit from in the long term.\n As stated before a specialized workforce eventually leads to a more\n\nsecure economy.\n With the Jamaican economy continuing its downward trend, it would be\n\nin the interest of the country if these agencies were to invest in its\n\npeople. \n\n  With the advent of free education for Jamaican University\n\nstudents, other Jamaicans, who may have had the necessary resources to study\n\nabroad, may reconsider hence keeping those resources within the country.\n This in turn aids the economy financially as more money, which would\n\nhave been spent in other countries, can be spent within this economy, making\n\nit more secure. \n\n  Another benefit for the country incorporating free education at\n\nthe university level and hence adding to its specialized workforce, would be\n\nthat it would no longer need to import specialized workers.\n The foreign exchange presently being wasted on such activities would\n\nbe spent in other sectors. \n\n  At each rung of the educational ladder, fewer persons would be\n\nallowed to advance due to many factors, cost being the most influential.\n With free education more persons will be able to expose themselves to\n\na tertiary education, unleashing talents that would have been suppressed due\n\nto a lack of the financial resources. \n\n  If the government and the private sector were to look at the\n\nlong-term effect of providing the necessary resources for university\n\neducation and implement it, they would support it whole-heartedly as the\n\neconomic situation of the country would drastically improve.  \n\n\n\n  Jamaican university students should not be required to pay\n\nfees for their education.  \n\n  The Mona Campus of the University of the West Indies is what its\n\nname suggests.\n It is not the University of Jamaica.\n Bard\n\n  Barbadians and other citizens of West Indian countries have as\n\nmuch right to attend it as Jamaicans do. \n\n  In light of the previous statement, it is disagreed that Jamaican\n\nuniversity students should not be required to pay fees for their education.\n .\n\n\n , the statement could have been agreed    \n\nupon   , but since the reality is that the university is of the West\n\nIndies, the original view is  preferred and agreed with.\n\n\n\n  There are various reasons Jamaicans should pay fees, equality,\n\nmentioned before, perhaps being the most important.\n The University of the West Indies is not a government owned entity,\n\nin other words, it is not run by the government.\n Hence, Jamaican students, being the majority of the student body,\n\nshould be required to pay fees in order to finance the school.\n in\n\nfact take over the school, to enable Jamaican students to attend free of\n\ncharge.\n However, given the current status or position, economically, of our\n\ncountry and its government, this may put a strain on the economy, which is\n\nalready in debt both locally and internationally. \n\n  In the statement, does " Jamaican university students\n\n" cover those attending university in Jamaica as well as the other\n\nbranches on other  islands?\n This is important, because depending on your career choice, you will\n\nattend university here, in Jamaica or in another West Indian country.\n Let us say, the statement applies only for Jamaican students\n\nattending university in Jamaica.\n solely\n\n  upon their career choice,  would have to pay for\n\nan education, while others would not, since  their areas of\n\nstudy were different, which forced them to attend different schools. \n\n  If this action was to be taken by Jamaica, it might trigger the\n\nother islands to do the same, and we ourselves would then see and complain\n\nhow unfair that would be.\n One person pays and one does not simply because of where they were\n\nborn or where they grew up.\n\n\n  In conclusion, Jamaican university students should pay for their\n\neducation.\n Either they pay fees, or students from other islands attend freely\n\nalso.  \n\n\n\n  JAMAICAN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED\n\nTO PAY FOR THEIR EDUCATION    \n\n  The cost of university studies in Jamaica is a very topical issue\n\nand is much debated in Jamaica today.\n The amount charged to students often depends on the curriculum, type\n\nof institution and by the gap between the approved budget from the Ministry\n\nof Education Youth and Culture ( MOEYC) and of the respective institutions (\n\n Source - Jamaica survey of living conditions 1996 PIOJ/STATIN  )\n\n\n\n  Students at the university pay for their\n\ntertiary education because of the fee structure developed by the short fall\n\nof the budget. \n\n  The University of the West Indies students pay 15.0 per cent of\n\nthe economic cost of their studies each semester depending on the course\n\nbeing pursued.\n This practice however, does not extend to all tertiary institutions.\n\n\n\n  Another reason why students pay is because of the declining\n\neconomy that is the reduced spending power of the government.\n If the government pay for their tertiary education it is not\n\nguaranteed that they will import and give back some of their acquired\n\nknowledge so that the country will benefit. \n\n  Usually, after completion of their tertiary education these\n\nscholars &asterisk; &asterisk; &asterisk; &asterisk; &asterisk; &asterisk;\n\n&asterisk; overseas for what they referred to as greener pastures or for\n\nbetter paying jobs.\n The effect this has on the educational system is usually that of a\n\nbrain drain. \n\n  Another reason why students pay for their tertiary education is\n\nthat they will benefit in the future.\n They will not be bonded by the government therefore they have the\n\nopportunity to choose which country to settle in and offer their skills  .\n\n \n\n  However, on the other hand there are numerous reasons why\n\nstudents should not be required to pay for their education.\n Tertiary education should be an expense to the government because it\n\nis an investment in human resource and the country would benefit. \n\n  If university students were deferred from paying for their\n\ntertiary education there would be more professionals in the country.\n More students from the poorer class or the less fortunate who could\n\nnot afford to pay for tertiary education would be able to attend university\n\nand acquire a higher standard of education.\n Therefore increasing their earning ability and making themselves more\n\nmarketable and competitive in their field of choice. \n\n  If the campus authority does not put in the necessary precautions\n\nand proper security system in place for the safety of its students and staff\n\nthen the level of teaching will deteriorate and this will affect the level of\n\nstandard of the students that the university send out into the working world\n\neach academic year.\n If lecturers are being attacked, subsequently, this will obviously\n\naffect their ability to teach and have the effect that it is intended to\n\nhave.\n In concluding, the government should ensure that the society is well\n\neducated.\n Institute the proper programme, which will enable students to get a\n\ntertiary level education after leaving secondary school.\n The government should allocate enough to support education in the\n\nbudget rather than on    unnecessary  \n\nluxury items.\n They should also use the education tax for the purpose, which it is\n\nintended.\n\n\n\n\n  Jamaican University Students should not be required to pay\n\nfees for their education.  \n\n  Over the years the University tuition fees has been rising\n\nconsistently.\n However, education has become expensive to Jamaican University\n\nstudents.\n The cost of education at the tertiary level has been noticed to\n\nincrease each academic school year due to the fact that education is less\n\nsubsidize by the government.\n Because the cost has become so high; education at the university\n\nlevel has become a scarce resource. \n\n  To not make it a requirement for Jamaican University students to\n\npay fees for their education like in the 1970\'s where the late Michael Manley\n\nprovided free education up to the University level.\n Providing free Education at the University level will be beneficial\n\nto the whole Jamaican economy. \n\n  Education is important for the development of a country\'s\n\neconomy.\n For example, in countries such as Taiwan and South Korea; both the\n\ncountries were at the same level of development as Jamaica in the 1960\'s.\n Because of the availability of free education at university level to\n\nthe masses; today these countries were able to grow faster in terms of\n\neconomic development, through human development.\n\n\neconomic development with per capita income almost at the same levels of many\n\nwell developed countries. \n\n \n\nDevelopment indicators that was published by the United Nations that ranks a\n\ncountry\'s development in terms of social development of a population.\n Education is one of the key indicator of human development.\n was discovered that most countries that have\n\nhigh rankings in Human Development; education is free at the tertiary level.\n Free education for Jamaican University students will mean that\n\neducation at the University will be available to the  wider  society.\n ,\n\n in terms of Human  development; for further\n\neconomic growth. \n\n  For education to be free at the University level in Jamaica it\n\ncan also have an adverse effect on the Jamaican economy.\n This level of education has to be paid for one way or another way.\n Jamaican University\n\nstudents should not pay fees for their education, this will    increase   government expenditure which might be against\n\npolicies set by the government.\n This kind of expenditure has to be allocated in government\'s budget\n\neach year; which is financed by tax payers.\n Some tax payers will not be able to afford the cost which is\n\nassociated with education at the University level. \n\n  in the\n\n1970s where education was free or heavily subsidize at the University level\n\nis a contributing factor to the cost of education today; at the University\n\nlevel. \n\n  Another reason why education at the University level should not\n\nbe free is because of the stigma that may be attached to the University.\n because it\n\nis free to the masses.\n For Example in countries like Germany and Italy where education is\n\nfree at the University level; nationals of these countries prefer to pay for\n\neducation in the U.K and the U.S.A because they think it is of better quality', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '77b8b53f-2148-4202-9071-ce9145c4f713', 'added':

{'text': 'Topic: Jamaican University Students should not be required to\n\npay fees for their education.  \n\n  The current situation concerning Jamaican students and the subject\n\nof fees is a very sore point of discussion.\n\n\nfees that university students are required to expend, in order to gain a\n\ntertiary education.\n There are a number of tertiary education institutions in Jamaica, the\n\ntwo major ones being the Mona Campus of the University of the West Indies (\n\nUWI) and the University of technology ( Utech).\n\n\nmoreso   more so    , is UWI.\n Even though the disciplines offered at UWI and Utech are essentially\n\ndifferent and therefore incomparable in terms of the monetary cost of the\n\ncourse; it is noteworthy that a medical student doing the Clinical Discipline\n\nis required to pay Jamaican\n\n$217,050.00 for tuition only; compared to a top level fee of J$100,000.00 at\n\nUtech for one of the most expensive courses there.\n In light of this the emphasis of this essay will be more on those\n\nJamaican students who attend UWI. \n\n  The question, then, is: Should Jamaican UWI students who are\n\nseeking a tertiary level education be asked to, or committed to, paying fees\n\nfor the education received?\n\n\nwould probably be the answer given by most of these students and their\n\nsponsors who are forced to shell out life savings in order to pay for their\n\neducation.\n However, upon closer examination, this may be an answer which is\n\ndevoid of forethought.\n The fact is, tertiary education comes at a cost.\n For a Third World/developing country like Jamaica with a particularly\n\npoor economic record, this cost is highly inflated.\n Thus, this cost must fall on the shoulders of someone, whether the\n\nGovernment or the student.\n\n\n  The harsh economic conditions which face the majority of our\n\ncitizens precludes the opportunity to seek higher education for many Jamaican\n\nstudents.\n They just cannot afford to go to University and so their education\n\nceases at the high school sixth form, community college level.\n do not have\n\nthe financial  \'backative\'  needed to secure a Student Loan.\n In this area the Government and the education system have failed\n\nthem ( the students) miserably.\n Also, the fact that UWI fees are so high and rising only adds sting\n\nto the sorrow.\n UWI has also failed the potential student in its bid to offer\n\nquality, affordable education to the people of Jamaica and the Caribbean.\n Apart from the ones who can afford a university education, the\n\nstudents who do manage to scrape together the funds for university, often\n\nfind themselves, after however long the time in university; unable to\n\nrepay the debts racked up during this time.\n This is due, usually to the lack of feasible employment.\n Therefore, before and after university the students finds that\n\nthe system has failed him/her.\n Based on these circumstances, it might be justified for Jamaican\n\nstudents to not have to pay fees for university. \n\n  Nevertheless, the question still arises.\n Who will pay for the university education if not the student?\n The possible alternatives are: the Jamaican Government; the private\n\nsector.\n Again, looking at the present economic situation, the second can be\n\ncrossed out as a possible or even distantly feasible alternative.\n So the Government can be the only other way.\n How would the Government sponsor all those students?\n Already, the Student\'s Loan Bureau is in operation.\n This is a revolving loan scheme set up by the Government\n\nspecifically for providing loans and grants to needy tertiary students.\n This scheme has met with some success since its inception.\n However, the source of funds for supplying or subsidising this loan\n\nscheme, apart from the revenue gained from repayment of loans, is the\n\nGovernment.\n The Government gains these funds from the revenue ( tax) collected.\n So it is the taxpayer who pays for these loans.\n Another way would be for the Government to subsidise, heavily, the\n\ncost of university education.\n Again, the funds would come from Government revenue.\n So taxpayers, many of whom have children going to, or are themselves\n\nstudents of university, would still be paying for the university education.\n\n\npaid taxpayers.\n So any way one looks at it, the cost of the university education\n\nstill falls on the shoulders of the selfsame people who would seek to have\n\nthe cost alleviated from their shoulders.\n The fact is if the Government should take up the task, then most\n\nlikely it would need to raise taxes or establish new ones.\n\n\n  So therefore, there is no one but the student who can pay for\n\ntheir university education.\n This may be seen by some as what ought to be.\n By being required to pay a student will place more value on the\n\neducation gained.\n Having had to pay, they will make sure that they gain the necessary\n\nskills to make them successful.\n If the education is free, students might be more likely to squander\n\ntime and other resources.\n A fitting illustration might be: a student who receives free tertiary\n\neducation may only think of aiming for a bare pass in order to get a degree,\n\nbut someone who had to pay will more likely ensure that they work towards\n\nfirst class honours in that degree.\n So when you pay for it, you value it more.\n This is not to say that gaining first class honours will ensure a job\n\nafter university, but it will give one more than a fighting chance. \n\n  Having examined the situation and having seen that the student\n\nought to pay; the fact must also be recognized, that the University is not\n\ndoing nearly enough to keep fees at a minimum, which is affordable to the\n\ncitizens of the country; who are desirous of a university education.\n all\n\n in his opening remarks at the 1998-99 Matriculation Ceremony for\n\nnew students, alluded to the fact that many parents had to mortgage their\n\nhouses in order to afford their child(ren)\'s tuition and other fees.\n That this is a sad fact; must not be lost on\n\nhim.\n It is a sad, unfortunate but necessary evil that Jamaican students\n\n are required to pay for their tertiary education.\n There is no feasible alternative; the Government cannot afford to;\n\nthe taxpayer can\'t and also the university, most likely, will not be able to\n\nhandle the massive influx of students;  neither the cheapening\n\nof the quality of university education to be gained.  \n\n\n\n  Jamaican students should not be required to pay for tertiary\n\nlevel education.  \n\n  Early childhood education is provided free for all Jamaicans,\n\ntherefore it is compulsory that all Jamaicans get  a primary\n\nschool education without cost to them. \n\n  It was made mandatory that all students attending high schools\n\npay school fee.\n In Jamaica the government uses the term " " cost sharing"\n\n" .\n Cost- sharing is where the government subsidize the greater portion\n\nof the    child\'s   high school education and\n\nthe student is made to pay a portion to assist in the funding. \n\n  At the tertiary level ( University of the West Indies) the\n\ngovernment pays the greater portion of the economic cost of education while\n\nstudents are asked to pay the other portion. \n\n  The arrangements for each level I think is reasonable\n\nsince the government cannot afford to pay the full cost, since they operate\n\nfrom a budget which has to be split between several ministries. \n\n  Tertiary level education is not compulsory but is for people who\n\nare academically inclined and strive for excellence. \n\n  students should go out in\n\nthe work world and work to finance further studies.\n For those who cannot afford to or prefers not to work the government\n\nprovides  a revolving loan scheme so that students can access\n\nfunding for their education. \n\n  The government should not be required to fund tertiary level\n\neducation since it is a choice made between work and school whether to be\n\nworking or studying full time.\n choice\n\n responsibility. \n\n  Qualified Jamaicans often find it easier to migrate from Jamaica\n\nand use their expertise abroad rather than trying to build the economy of the\n\ncountry.\n This would be a high cost to the government who in turn would have to\n\nraise taxes, thus placing more pressure on the working class people in the\n\ncountry, to fund education  \n\n\n\n  " Jamaican University Students Should\n\nNot Be Required To Pay Fees For Their Education".   \n\n  country, some\n\nof Jamaica\'s social problems can be linked to the quality of life which its\n\ncitizens enjoy.\n Poverty is widespread and is a major contributing factor to the level\n\nand types of crime experienced in the country.\n It can be further argued that the level of poverty is due largely to\n\nthe rate of illiteracy. \n\n  Considering that illiteracy is such a pressing social problem it\n\nshould be placed on the governments priority agenda.\n The government, and in fact the business community, should ensure\n\nthat students are educated not only at the primary and secondary but also the\n\ntertiary level. \n\n  Individuals have been able to achieve personal, material success\n\nwithout the benefit of a tertiary education.\n However, if the economy is to grow significantly, and consequently\n\nthe standard of living be improved for all, emphasis needs to be placed on a\n\ncomprehensive plan for tertiary education to be made accessible to\n\nacademically qualified Jamaicans. \n\n  The high cost of tertiary education ( tuition fees and associated\n\nexpenses) presently make it nothing but a dream for most bright young\n\nstudents.\n and\n\nacademic ability of Jamaicans is left, for the most part, untapped or worse\n\nmisdirected ( drugs and crime) in the absence of viable alternatives. \n\n  The number of Jamaican students whose parents/guardians can\n\nafford to pay for their tertiary education is in the minority.\n Increasingly, the trend is that most have to work for a year or two\n\nto finance their education or settle for enrolling in part-time or evening\n\nprogrammes. \n\n In an economy crying out for constitutional, economic and social reform,\n\nthe national emphasis should be on educating Jamaicans to play Key roles in\n\nnational development.\n As such, tertiary level education should be made available to the\n\nacademically qualified free of cost. \n\n\n\n  " Jamaican students should not be required to pay for\n\ntheir education." \n\n\n  Ideally Jamaican students should not be required to pay for their\n\neducation.\n Despite this assertion, the level and cost of education, the Jamaican\n\neconomy and the state of the Jamaican education system may alter the reality.\n\n\n\n  Considering the benefits reaped from education, both personally\n\nand with regards to society on a whole; one might declare that it should be\n\noffered free of cost to the public.\n Thus, the above assertion may be consolidated.\n Education is paramount in any society.\n It is a means of academic enlightenment through teaching.\n Daily, we as Jamaicans are witness to the disadvantages of ignorance\n\nin our society.\n \'knowledge is power\'\n\n , expresses the benefits of education; especially to a third world\n\ncountry.\n Education allows us, as a people to improve ourselves through\n\ncreativity and technology.\n An educated nation today, manifests a prosperous nation in the\n\nfuture.\n With these considerations in mind, one can strongly assert that\n\neducation should be free of cost. \n\n  , the\n\nconstraints of reality inhibit free education.\n , Jamaica is a\n\nthird world nation, undergoing economic development.\n , when compared to the\n\nfree education in  first world countries such as England\n\nand Canada.\n These countries are able to provide free primary and secondary\n\neducation, while assisting tertiary education.\n\n\n; thus subsidizing education at all levels.\n Thus, education costs are partially burdened by students. ( as\n\nstudents of this University may testify to).\n This subsidization, comes closest to the ideal.\n In considering this discussion, one might highlight the improvements\n\nmade in the education sector.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '7861ea67-c441-4310-8560-7b8f0422b5ff', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.273506+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9710731506347656, 'non_english_score': 0.028926849365234375}
{'text': 'Topic: Jamaican university students should not be required to\n\npay for their education.  \n\n  ,\n\n and, its  attainance assists in equipping\n\nan individual for the twenty-first-century job market.\n hundreds of students\n\nenroll in the island\'s largest tertiary institution.\n The majority of these students are unable to solely finance their\n\neducation and are assisted by the Government of the country, by way of\n\nstudent loans.\n The fees that are quoted by the University of the West Indies are fees\n\nnet of    sponsorship  by the\n\nGovernment and can still be viewed as being high. \n\n  The statement above which I seek to discuss is advocating that as\n\nJamaicans we should not pay for our university education.\n Taking into account the fact that many individuals do not excel\n\neducationally because of financial constraints; one might  apt\n\nto agree with the statement.\n It is a fact that not every student who applies for a student loan\n\nwill be granted one.\n As a result of this, they are unable\n\nto accomplish tertiary level education. \n\n  at\n\n from a broader point of view.\n lvel\n\n level of illiteracy among Jamaicans.\n for the most part can\n\nalso be blamed  on the high cost of tertiary level education.\n As the more educated one is, probably the higher the standard of\n\nliving.\n Crime also, can be blamed on lack of education at a certain level.\n so\n\n  poor quality of their lives caused possibly,  from\n\nthe lack of success which comes with a degree. \n\n  Let us now look at the cons to having free tertiary level\n\neducation.\n at present persons are not excelling\n\neducationally because of the cost of doing so, when it is free and if it is,\n\nit is very much possible that many individuals may waste the opportunity to\n\nmake good of themselves by becoming intellectuals just because it is too easy\n\nfor them.\n They have no obstacles so they do not seize the opportunity.\n Also, if university education becomes free the job market would\n\nbecome saturated as everyone would be qualified, and the market would be\n\nfiercely competitive. \n\n  From an economic point of view we will see this issue in a\n\ntotally different light.\n The university is undoubtedly expensive to maintain and the tutors\n\nand lecturers need to be paid; therefore if the Government should take on all\n\nthe cost the expense would be a very great one.\n Jamaica would be a\n\nvery large one as expenditure would far exceed income or receipts.\n The burden taxpayers would have to pay would also be unimaginable, as\n\nthe government raises funding through taxes. \n\n  In order to allow us not to pay for our university education\n\notherwise from taxes, the government may have to borrow loans that have\n\nto be repaid and will  place the country into extreme\n\nfinancial difficulties.\n refuse from working\n\nwith the Government after achieving their degrees which unfortunately makes\n\nfinding qualified persons for the public sector difficult. \n\n  By looking at both sides, I think the government should award\n\nmore scholarships especially to  needy students.\n They can also try to subsidise the cost a bit more to cushion\n\nthe heaviness of it.\n They should also allocate more funds for expenditure on education so\n\nas to  increase  their loan portfolio. \n\n  In closing, regardless of the fact that the cost of tertiary\n\nlevel education is relatively high, we must persist its attainance\n\nand maybe we can help the economy to develop to a point where education\n\non a whole can be cost-free.  \n\n\n\n  Topic: Jamaican University students should not be required to\n\npay fees for their education  \n\n  In today\'s world more and more persons are gravitating towards\n\ntertiary education.\n As the desires for higher learning escalate so does the cost.\n by\n\nthe individuals themselves, while some receive sponsorship from the\n\norganizations in which they are employed. \n\n  Many would argue that it is the state\'s responsibility to educate\n\nits people.\n In fact, this is done up to the secondary level in many countries.\n , is at the\n\nfull cost of the individual.\n Not everyone will opt for tertiary level education, therefore those\n\nwho do should not be denied because of lack of funds. \n\n  Jamaica has a unique situation in that education is free only up\n\nto the primary level.\n As a result of the cost sharing between government and parents some\n\nchildren are deprived of a secondary education as parents sometimes cannot\n\nafford their portion of the fees.\n as education up to the\n\nsecondary level should be the responsibility of the state.\n When this is so every individual would have the opportunity to be\n\nfunctionally literate and would then be able to contribute meaningfully to\n\nthe development of the country. \n\n  Although university tuition in Jamaica is somewhat subsidized it\n\nis still out of the reach of many who aspire towards a university education.\n One school of thought would argue that a university education is a\n\nchoice, it is not necessary for one to be a well adjusted member of society,\n\ntherefore, those who choose that route should be prepared to pay.\n It is true that one does not need a university education to function\n\nas a worthwhile member of society, but this level of education makes one a\n\nmore rounded person.\n It makes one better equipped to fill crucial positions in the\n\ncountry.\n as there are\n\nnot many skilled and qualified persons available. \n\n  If a country wants to move forward; if it wants to make sure that\n\nthere are qualified persons available to full positions when they become\n\nvacant; if it wants to have people to carry on when death or old age has\n\ntaken its toll on its leaders, then it must assist at the tertiary level.\n Nothing in life is free, someone has to pay at some point, but when a\n\ncountry invests in its people then that country is moving forward.  \n\n\n\n  Jamaican university students should not be required to pay\n\nfees for their education.  \n\n  Had Jamaica been a first world nation, capable of providing free\n\ncollege education for its future leaders, then one could easily agree with\n\nthis moot.\n However the country is gravely lacking in economic strength, hence to\n\nagree with such an endeavour, as free education, would be ludicrous.\n\n\n  Firstly, Jamaican students only pay 15% of the total cost of\n\ntuition.\n\n\nallieviated   alleviated   85% of that cost.\n This is quite impressive as the cost of tuition can reach some\n\n$400,000 to\n\n$800,000 levels.\n First world countries do allot some percentage of cost to their\n\nstudents.\n English students pay up to &pound; 1000 for University Education.\n\n\n\n  For Jamaica, free college education would be disastrous.\n Yes, many more Jamaicans would be able to attend University, however\n\nas the Government provides free primary level education, it would produce a\n\ndrain on resources.\n\n\n  The presence of bursaries, scholarships and the student Loan\n\nbureau, also make free college education  \n\n  unnecessary   ; as they provide  aid to students who can not afford the 15% of tuition. \n\n  On the other side of the argument, There are the benefits of free\n\ncollege education.\n The truth of the matter; some may argue, is that with the very low\n\nlevels of salaries for the majority of Jamaican workers/parents, the cost of\n\neducation is rather steep.\n Even 15%, of a\n\n$400,000 tuition may be too expensive. \n\n  Agencies of aid such as the Student Loan, do not guarantee\n\napproval or loans or bursaries for needy students.\n Indeed many students who gravely need assistance are declined loans\n\nby the Bureau every year.\n Scholarships also only cater at times for one exceptional student.\n As a result an average or even a good needy student may be declined a\n\nloan. \n\n  There is also the argument that free college education would\n\npromote more students to achieve and, their parents would be encouraged to\n\nsend them to school.\n\n\n  education might do\n\njust the opposite.\n Parents might not see the importance of encouraging students to\n\nachieve, because the education cost is greatly cut or students may become\n\ncomplacent, because their parents, cannot force them to be educated, because\n\n \'Mom and Dad are not footing the bill"  and education is free\n\nso they believe that they can simply waste time at school.\n " my parents\n\nspent their life savings to send me to the U.W.I"  is removed and a\n\nsense of responsibility is lost. \n\n  In light of this free education for University students is\n\noverall a bad idea, as it encourages complacency and irresponsibility.\n " striving for\n\nAchievement and Success in a developing nation." \n\n\n\n\n  We live in a revolving world where everything around us is\n\nchanging.\n For us to remain viable, we have to cope with global and\n\norganizational changes.\n As a result of this, the demand for tertiary education is on the rise\n\nin our country, and therefore, I disagree with the statement that Jamaican\n\nstudents should not be required to pay for their education fees. \n\n  If students are not to pay for their fees, obviously that would\n\nbe the country\'s responsibility.\n It would not be practical for a small developing country like Jamaica\n\nto pay for tertiary education for its students as we are faced with a climate\n\nof financial instability and hardship. \n\n  Several companies are closing down forcing hundreds of persons\n\nout of jobs.\n Other organizations have run into financial problems and the\n\ngovernment has had to assist them by injecting funds, and in some cases, take\n\nover operations. \n\n  The government is unable to adequately provide for the basic\n\nneeds of the nation at large in areas such as food, health, housing and\n\neducation for all children of school age.\n Many homeless and mentally ill persons roam the streets daily and the\n\ngovernment does not seem to care much about them.\n Infrastructure such as good roads, piped water and electricity are\n\nnon-existent in many sections of this country.\n Satisfying these needs, it would deem to be more important than\n\nfunding tuition for university students. \n\n  Based on the inability to satisfactorily meet those needs stated\n\nabove, if the government were to pay fees they could only afford to offer\n\nsuch benefits to a relatively small amount of people.\n If this would be the case, some advantages could be derived for both\n\nthe country and the students involved. \n\n  The students would be motivated to become more community and\n\ncountry oriented as they would feel that the country has their interest at\n\nheart and in so doing, they would use their specialized skills to assist in\n\nthe social and economic development of the county.\n\n\n  A tertiary education would be attained by those students who\n\ncannot afford to pay for fees. \n\n  Students could also save towards specific goals, like car\n\nownership, instead of using that money for fees. \n\n \n\n  Paying tuition for university students would result in the\n\ndecline of the services in some other sectors of the economy, as education at\n\nthis level is very costly. \n\n  Students might not put out much effort in their studies as they\n\nare not paying, therefore they would have no money    to\n\n  lose if they fail their courses. \n\n  If an opportunity arises for a student, on completion, to go\n\noverseas for employment, or even to do further studies, they could not\n\nimmediately take up the offer.\n This is because they would normally be required to work in the\n\ncountry for a stated number of years first.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '589f365b-929f-4d5d-84e0-0ef4e45d708d', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.275034+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9830840229988098, 'non_english_score': 0.016915977001190186}
{'text': 'ASSIGNMENT: Jamaican University Students should be required to\n\npay fees for their education.  \n\n \n\n  Education plays a very important role towards the development of\n\nour  youths and our country.\n Our youths should be encouraged to attain the highest possible level\n\nof education which will be beneficial to our country in the future. \n\n  However, I am of the view that Jamaican University students should\n\nbe required to pay fees for their education.\n I take this stance because Jamaica is a developing country and is not\n\nable to competently provide for basic needs such healthcare, security, and\n\neven education.\n The economic situation in Jamaica is enjoying some of its worst\n\nmoments.\n\n\n  The government would not be able to allow free education to\n\neveryone at the University level.\n There are students who have genuine financial needs and cannot afford\n\nthe cost of education at this level.\n For these students, the government has put in place, The Students\n\nLoan Bureau.\n The Students Loan Bureau assists in the funding of tuition, books and\n\nother needs; by way of long term loans. \n\n  If the government in Jamaica was to allow free education, then\n\nwhere would the financial resources come from to maintain the institution.\n There will definitely be more pressure on tax-payers to contribute\n\nmore thereby contributing to the decline in the standard of living of our\n\npeople. \n\n  At this time, one of our country\'s woes is that of high\n\nunemployment.\n If free education was to be allowed, where would jobs come from to\n\nsatisfy everyone\'s needs?\n If the government is not able to create more jobs then these\n\nUniversity students would not feel encouraged to remain in their country and,\n\nbuild it.\n When these intellectuals leave for greener pastures, they would be\n\ncontributing to the country\'s brain drain. \n\n  I am not in total opposition to free education.\n I believe that education should be free up to the secondary level.\n At that level the government has seen to the mandatory education of\n\nall. \n\n  Free education at he University level allows for complacency and\n\n indiscipline; because it is of no cost to the\n\nstudent, then the drive and commitment to work hard and succeed will be\n\nlacking.\n In essence, what the students may be paying is that they have nothing\n\nto lose. \n\n  It is undoubted that education is a fundamental part of our\n\nlives, but the government of Jamaica, because of its limited resources,\n\ncannot afford to promote free education at this time.  \n\n\n\n  Jamaican university students should not be required to\n\npay fees for their education.   \n\n  Education is a fundamental issue in all societies.\n Through education an individual will gain moral and mental discipline\n\nwhich will guide him or her in their future career endeavours.\n This will in turn contribute in improving the economy of the society\n\nin which the individual lives. \n\n  If Jamaican university students were not required to pay fees for\n\ntheir education then there would be both advantages and disadvantages for all\n\nconcerned. \n\n  A free tertiary education system would attract many Jamaicans and\n\nthe percentage of students per year entering the university would increase.\n The advantages would be that more Jamaicans would benefit, and in the\n\nfuture more qualified individuals would be available in the job market.\n Also Jamaicans would not have to enter the university in the prime\n\nyears of their adult lives to further their education because they would have\n\nhad the opportunity to do so at a more earlier stage in life. \n\n  However, the disadvantages would be that the standards of\n\neducation would decrease in the university because there would be more\n\nstudents to educate.\n\n\ndefinately   definitely   be a major problem.\n The lecturers and tutors will probably not have the time to react\n\nwith all the students on a one to one level during their office times or in\n\nthe lecture theatres.\n The marking schemes in examinations might not be effective because\n\nthere would be more papers to mark, and so less attention might be given in\n\nthe marking of papers and more errors maybe overlooked. \n\n  There might be little or no space for other Caribbean students\n\nwho are non- Jamaicans in the university because preference may be given to\n\nthe qualified Jamaican students.\n As a result the university may suffer from a lack of funds and so the\n\nphysical standard of the university may also decline. \n\n  The university would be at a great disadvantage because enough\n\nmoney would not be available to keep up the maintenance of the institution.\n The miscellaneous fees paid by each student would not be enough to\n\nhelp to adequately maintain the university.\n The fees paid by non-Jamaican students would probably have to be\n\nincreased and considering the physical condition of the institution and the\n\nproblem of sufficient spacing for each student then the university might not\n\nbe a major attraction for other Caribbean students. \n\n  definitely\n\n  result in low faculty equipment.\n For example the Faculty of Medicine may not have enough lab apparatus\n\nor equipment to adequately meet the needs of all the medical students.\n Also the boarding facilities for students would not be up to standard\n\nand less students may have to board because of lack of space. \n\n  In reality Jamaican university students are required to pay fees\n\nfor their education because it would be unfair for the government or any\n\nother leading body to cater for the thousands and thousands of students in\n\nJamaica that wish to    receive   a tertiary\n\nlevel education. \n\n  However, certain opportunities are open for those Jamaicans that\n\ncannot afford the university\'s tuition fees.\n Firstly there is a scholarship system where different organisations\n\nand the government may provide scholarships for students with profound\n\nabilities in their academic subjects.\n The scholarship serves as the tuition fund which assists the\n\nstudents.\n Secondly the government provides a Student Loan Bureau which lends\n\nqualified students the tuition fee to pay the university and this money is\n\npaid back after the student have    receive  their\n\ntertiary level education and can pay back the loan. \n\n  Although more Jamaicans from different classes in the society may\n\nbenefit if they were not required to pay fees for their university education.\n The disadvantage, however would be overwhelming and it would be\n\nclearly seen that the university would not operate effectively if free\n\nservices were given.  \n\n\n\n  Jamaican University Students should not pay fees for their\n\neducation  \n\n  The Heinmann English Dictionary defines education as the act\n\nor process of educating which means to instruct or develop especially through\n\nformal teaching or training.\n It therefore follows that the main purpose of education is personal\n\ndevelopment.\n clearly at the\n\nUniversity level where students receive training which equips them with the\n\nskills and qualifications to earn a living in the \n\ncareer of their choice.\n\n\nstudents who are qualified to attend the University should be given this\n\nopportunity whether or not they can afford it. \n\n  There are several arguments which I would like to put forward\n\nwhich support my opinion.\n The first is that a large portion of our society lives below the\n\npoverty line.\n\n\n  young people with the potential to do exceptionally well\n\nat the University level.\n However, because of financial constraints, these persons cannot go\n\nvery far in the educational system.\n Hence, they are forced to drop out of the educational system and\n\nnever fulfil their potential for greatness. \n\n \n\nincreasing number of qualified prospective employees going into the job\n\nmarket these days, persons who are already employed may see the need to seek\n\nfurther  qualifications from the University.\n Some of these persons will have the qualifications to at least attend\n\nthe University on a part-time basis but cannot do so because of in <l>\n\nsufficient funds.\n As a result, they will be unable to go as far as their abilities can\n\ntake them in their respective organizations or even keep their present\n\njobs. \n\n  The underlying fact is that both these groups contain a vast\n\nnumber of human resources.\n Now if these persons are able to obtain a University education, some\n\nof them could perhaps develop the skills to make Jamaica a more developed\n\nnation by increasing its level of productivity. \n\n  One may now wonder who would pay for the fees of the University\n\nstudents.\n Well firstly, the Government could significantly reduce all other\n\n taxes and increase the education tax.\n In addition, the Government could also give tax relief\n\nincentives to private sector firms which award full scholarships to\n\nUniversity students.\n Finally, the students would have to work in Civil Service or these\n\nprivate sector firms for a period of five years after which they would be\n\nfree to work elsewhere or stay where they are. \n\n  In concluding, I would like to say that as the years go by,\n\nUniversity Education will become more expensive.\n However, this does not mean that some members of society should\n\nreceive a quality education and others should fall by the wayside because\n\nthey cannot afford it.\n millenium\n\n  millennium   , it becomes more necessary for every\n\nmember of society to become more qualified and have the skills to survive in\n\nan  ever changing world.  \n\n\n It is a matter of each one help one.\n Finally, our country Jamaica will see more students attending the\n\nUniversities and at the end of each student\'s course of study he or she\n\nshould be able to be a better individual, more aware and conscious of the\n\nchanging times.  \n\n\n This also implies that the government\n\nshould supply financial aid in order allow students to access education.\n\n\n  underprivileged   of the country would\n\nbe able access quality education. \n\n \n\n cross section   of the population would \n\nbe educated consequently.\n This would contribute to an educated and skilled labour force.\n This would also influence the increase in productivity as more\n\nskilled, educated efficient people would be employed in business places and\n\nfirms, which would make tremendous contributions to the growth of the\n\neconomy. \n\n  Thirdly, I don\'t think students should pay tuition since\n\nEducation tax was implemented to  use \n\nprimarily for education purposes.\n However these funds are misappropriated and use for other means.\n I think this should be used pay tuitions, thus making education\n\naccessible. \n\n  One may argue that the students Loan Bureau is providing\n\nfinancial assistance for Jamaican students but how many students have\n\nbenefited from this programme?\n Certainly not many when the total number of application is\n\nconsidered.\n I strongly believe that the growth and success of a country is\n\ndependent on the level of education the citizens   \n\nreceived   .\n If Jamaica is to move forward in this twenty first century the\n\ngovernment of the day has to ensure that every citizen is given the chance to\n\nobtain quality education by greatly subsidizing tuition or making education\n\nfree so that all Jamaicans can access education.  \n\n\n " Silver and Gold\n\nwill vanish away but a good education will never decay"  . \n\n \n\n\n\n  If Jamaican University students are not required to pay fees for\n\ntheir education, competitiveness among students will be increased for a place\n\nat  a University as there  are two\n\nuniversities in    Jamaica   .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n high schools.\n achied\n\n  achieved.\n Although it might be stated that education should be free of cost,\n\ndespite the fact that it is not;    one might also consider the possibility of education not\n\nbeing subsidized.\n\n\n  Therefore, although we may agree with the assertion; the factual\n\nreality has to be considered.\n Jamaica\'s economy and the current state of the education system have\n\nto be considered while discussing the assertion.\n With these statements in mind, one might agree that the current\n\nsystem, although subject to improvement, is the most appropriate solution at\n\nthe moment.  \n\n\n\n  With all the above factors taken into consideration I think\n\nJamaican university students should pay for their education fees.\n This would make them more independent and their self-esteem would be\n\nsoaring, knowing that they worked hard, and have achieved a degree or a\n\ndiploma.', 'subdomain':

{'text': 'when\n\nit can stand alone in the case of  "  Sally\n\nwalked down the street."\n\n  " Sally" is a noun phrase and be clefted for\n\nexample " It was  Sally who walked down the\n\nstreet."\n\n \n\nana head.\n\n\n \n\n  The head is the noun so it is called a noun phrase.\n This phrase consists of a modifier and an adjective P.\n be\n\nungrammatical to say:\n\n  she\n\nis."\n\n  Here the modifier is attributing to meaning.\n\n\n  Likewise in the given data the possessive marker is attached to\n\nthe noun phrase and not the noun.\n jamaican</-\n\n>Jamaican data is a noun, the significant entity is the noun\n\nphrase.\n " Fi" has to be clefted with the entire phrase:\n\n" [ fi yu maaga \x13 fut fren]" for it to be grammatical\n\nbecause if attached to the noun it makes it ungrammatical.\n\n  In the English data, the entire phrase is a noun phrase dominated\n\nby a noun entity.\n hat\n\nbut [ the woman in the blue coat\'s] hat.\n Therefore it would be ungrammatical to attach the possessive marker\n\nwith the noun since  it is attached to noun phrases.\n example to justify this\n\nnotion is:\n\n \n\n  ( ii) " On the table is where [ Jack\'s book]\n\nis."\n\n  The noun phrase " [ Jack\'s book]" is clefted\n\ngrammatically and not for example\n\n  " *Jack\'s on the table book is."\n Therefore " Jack\'s" is a word and not a phrase so\n\nonly phrases are clefted.\n Words sometimes have to make up phrases and not stand by themselves\n\nas a phrase to carry meaning.\n The word " very" are modifiers and therefore has to\n\nbe combined with adjectives and noun in noun phrases therefore conveying\n\nmeaning.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Subjects and direct objects can be tested for in several ways.\n To show the syntactic properties of subject examine the following\n\nsentences.\n\n  ( 1) Penguins have inhabited Antarctica for centuries,\n\nhaven\'t they?\n\n  ( 2) Antarctica has been inhabited by penguins for\n\ncenturies, hasn\'t it?\n\n  Both sentences are tag questions and are grammatical.\n The subject of sentence 1, is " Penguins" so the\n\npronoun used in the second clause  a NP consisting of  a noun "\n\ndog", the other item in the phrase is the indefinite article\n\n" " the"" which helps to give reference only if the phrase\n\nis part of earlier discourse that mentions a dog.\n\n  The heads do not give reference, it is the combination of the\n\nhead and the other items that give reference; that is, phrases are important\n\nin pointing out the particular entity that is  being talked about.\n In " fi yu maaga fut fren", " fi"\n\nthe  possessive marker \n\nattaches to the phrase, as is seen in the ungrammatical sentences when it is\n\nseparated from the rest of the items in the phrase. \n\n  In the NP " the woman in the blue coat\'s hat"\n\n" the hat" does belong to the woman, but the  genitive marker does not attach to the word "\n\nwoman".\n The suffix is attached to the NP.\n The entire phrase has a reference " a woman in a blue\n\ncoat", this is shown by looking at the entire phrase not "\n\nwoman" in isolation, therefore the significance of phrases is shown\n\nby the  genitive marker being attached to the\n\nend of the NP and not to the head word.\n Note that ungrammaticality results when the suffix is attached to the\n\nnoun.\n\n  Clefting is a method of distinguishing whether a group of words\n\nconstitute a phrase or not.\n be\n\nclefted  that group of words is a phrase.\n Consider, " A yu fren mi sii", and the ungrammatical\n\n" *A fren mi sii yu", here " yu fren" is a\n\nphrasal unit, hence separation results in ungrammaticality.\n The difference is apparent when the sentence is seen in its original\n\nstate " mi sii yu fren".\n\n\nNP. \n\n  In " A pan di tiebl di kii de", the PP "\n\npan di tiebl" must be \n\nclefted as an entire phrase \x13 hence ungrammaticality results.\n " Pan" by itself does not constitute a PP \x13 the PP\n\nconsists of the P  " pan" and the NP  " di tiebl" \x13 hence the ungrammatical "\n\n*A pan di kii de di tiebl".\n The grammatical cleft sentence supports this: " Di kii de pan\n\ndi tiebl."\n Also, the original sentence: " Di kii de pan di\n\ntiebl", shows us that " de pan" is a phrasal\n\nunit.\n\n  Combining words into phrases, allows for better understanding of\n\ndiscourse.\n the units\n\nthey co-occur with to form phrases, give not only sense to discourse but also\n\nreference.\n\n\nword</unclear> being talked about, and the meaningful  roles that these entities play in discourse.\n\n  The notions of subject and direct objects are fundamental to\n\nsyntactic analysis.\n In order to explain the relationships that exist among the items in a\n\nsentence we need to know  how to identify subjects and\n\ndirect objects.\n Subjects\n\nand direct objects  have structural functions in sentences,\n\nthese functions are grammatical functions.\n\n  test for subject is\n\ncase, subjects have subjective case.\n as\n\nsee the subject pronouns are " she", "\n\nhe", " they", " you", "\n\nI".\n These pronouns can appear only in subject position of a tensed\n\nclause.\n Contrast with the object pronouns " her", "\n\nhim", " them".\n The ungrammaticality of " *Them disliked they"\n\nsupports this.\n\n  Syntactic test for subject has to do with tag\n\nquestions, in a tag the subject NP determines the NP that appears in the\n\ntag.\n\n \n\nsubject to see whether " penguins" have subjective\n\ncase we substitute a pronoun, in this case \x13 " they".\n " They" is therefore the subject and it reappears\n\nin the tag.\n ( ii) if we\n\nsubstitute the pronoun " it" for "\n\nAntarctica", it also reappears in the tag.\n regarded as a dummy\n\nsubject.\n We could have also substituted another pronominal to check if\n\n" Antarctica" had subjective case, as " "\n\nit"" is not morphologically marked in subjective or objective\n\ncase.\n\n  Only subjects and their verbs agree.\n If the subject is singular the verb is marked morphologically by the\n\nsuffix \x13s.\n\n\n  The direct\n\nobject is usually local to the verb.\n DO\'s are usually participants in the activity denoted by the verb.\n This would lead us to say that syntactically the DO must be local or\n\nnear to the verb.\n In ( VI) " the penguins" are the entities being\n\nwatched ( ie they are the D.O. of the V), when it is separated from the V\n\nungrammaticality results.\n "\n\nher binoculars" serves as a modifier, a D.O is the NP that follows\n\nthe verb and is a participant in the activity denoted by the verb and must\n\nnot be a modifier.\n\n\n\n \n In English, sentences are made up of subjects and verbs.\n The verbs selects its participants which are the arguments.\n Verbs are intransitive and transitive.\n Transitive verbs take a direct object whether optionally or\n\npurposefully.\n\n  The morphological test for direct objects is that they are in\n\nobjective case or accusative case.\n The direct object in English must be a noun phrase that immediately\n\nfollows the transitive verb.\n\n  semantic test on the other hand shows\n\nthat the direct object is the entity that the action is being done to.\n Let us examine the following data and see if the results are what is\n\nstated about the direct objects.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  In sentence ( i) ( a) the verb " \'served\'" has\n\nan inherent meaning, that is, you have to  serve something.\n The item that was served is " \'lunch\'" which\n\nimmediately follows the verb and it is in the objective case.\n Sentence i ( b) on the other hand is what we refer to a dative\n\nalternative whereby the direct object changes place with the indirect object\n\nand the preposition " \'to\'" is deleted.\n In this case " \'the students\'" that follow the verb\n\nis not a direct object because a preposition can be inserted.\n This means that " " the students\'" is the object of\n\nthe preposition and not the verb " \'served\'".\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Again from this data sentence ( iii) ( a) has a direct object\n\n" \'circles\'" as it is a noun phrase and it immediately\n\nfollows the verb " \'turned\'".\n However, in sentence ( b) the preposition " \'on\'"\n\ncomes between the verb and the noun phrase " \'the ice-\n\nmaker\'" and where there is an insertion the noun phrase is an object\n\nof the preposition and not the verb.\n\n  In sentence ( iii) ( b) the noun phrase " \'the\n\nice-maker\'" is the direct object of the complex verb " \'turned\n\non\'" because it immediately follows the verb.\n The word " \'on\'" is not a preposition but a part of\n\nthe verb " \'turned\'".\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  In the sentence v ( a), the noun phrase, " \'the\n\nstory\'" is also a direct object of the verb " \'know\'"\n\nbecause it immediately follows it and it is in objective case.\n However in sentence ( v) ( b) the phrase that follows the verb is\n\nnot a direct object.\n The sentence consists of two clauses, that is, the main clause and\n\nan embedded clause.\n Although the pronoun " \'him\'" that follows the verb\n\nis in objective case, it is the subject in the embedded clause of the\n\ninfinitive verb " \'to be\'".', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '8563b25f-2110-4f80-91be-70de8cd3e3ae',

{'text': "The Amerindian languages present in the Caribbean today are only a\n\nfraction of the various languages that were spoken by the indigenous people\n\nwho once lived in the Greater and Lesser Antilles and the South American\n\nCoast.\n The Languages spoken by the Amerindians could be broadly classified\n\nunder the headings Arawaks ( Lokono), Caribs ( Kari&ntilde;a) and Warav.\n During the Pre-Columbian period studies show that the Arawaks who were\n\nmore peaceful than the Caribs initially occupied the islands of the Greater\n\nAntilles but were constantly moving from one island to the next, fleeing from\n\nthe raids of the Caribs.\n\n\nkilled the males and kept the females as servants or companions.\n As a result of this, many of the women in the Carib villages spoke\n\nArawak and in turn taught this language to their children.\n However, because the language of the society was Carib, these children\n\nespecially the male children would also speak Carib, the language of their\n\nfathers.\n Thus there was acculturation taking place in these Amerindian\n\ncommunities where depending on factors such as the number of raids ( Arawak\n\nwomen in the community) and the motivation of the children to speak Arawak or\n\nCarib, the language of a particular Amerindian community would move further\n\naway from the original language from which it started.\n\n \n\n  In some cases the Carib languages are mutually intelligible and in\n\nsome instances they are not.\n\n\nsimiliarsimilar to another Carib language depends on the\n\ndegree of acculturation between the Carib and Arawak languages and whether\n\nthese two Carib languages were near each other and were able to have parallel\n\ntypes of development.\n the Carib languages there\n\nsuch as Akawaio, Waiwai, Arekuna and Patamano are mutually unintelligible.\n One reason for this could be that these languages do not have a\n\ncontinuous connection, that is, they are not geographically near each other\n\nor are separated by Arawak or Warav languages.\n However, it has been noted that the Arawak languages Guarijo, Lokono\n\nand Guarafuni are not only related to each other but they are all very \n\nfamine, malnutrition and cruelty of the European\n\ncolonist.\n With these Amerindians the languages that they spoke also died.\n ( During the 16th and 17th centuries not many of the languages spoken\n\nby these Amerindians were documented.)\n\n  The arrival of the Europeans not only reduced the number of\n\nAmerindian languages and caused the language death of others but it also\n\nbrought about the creation of new language varieties.\n For instance, the Island Caribs ( Arawaks) living in St Vincent,\n\nrescued Africans from  Spanish slave ships that wrecked near St\n\nVincent.\n These two groups joined together to fight a common enemy \x13 the\n\nEuropeans.\n As a result of this relationship, a new language and ethnic group was\n\nformed from this union.\n The language of the Black Caribs, which is said to be very similar to\n\nthe language of the Red Caribs \x13 Arawaks has influences from the African and\n\nthe Spanish and French.\n\n  Now the language situations of the Africans in Florida who\n\nencountered the Indians ( native Americans) who  left\n\nAlabama for Florida to escape the English encroachment on their territory is\n\ndifferent from that of the Black Caribs, who  used\n\nAmerindian as the model language incorporated African, Spanish,\n\nFrench lexicon and grammar in some instances.\n The Afro-seminole however did not develop an Amerindian language as a\n\nresult of their contact with the Seminoles.\n These people still spoke a language variety that was close to the\n\nGullah    Creole   and spoke the Amerindian language as a second\n\nlanguage.\n this contact did not\n\nresult in  an Amerindian language being created, because these\n\nAfricans already had a developed stable    Creole\n\n when they met with the Seminoles.\n Other factors that probably also contributed to the Afro-Seminole\n\nspeaking the Indian language as a second language and Spanish as a third is\n\nalso  attitude.\n The Afro-Seminoles unlike the Black Caribs did not claim the identity\n\nof the Indians with whom they joined.\n They continued to see themselves as a separate ethnic and linguistic\n\ngroup.\n\n  The introduction of sugar to the various colonies resulted in\n\nsignificant changes in the social and economic state of the colony which in\n\nturn impacted the linguistic situation.\n\n  Prior to the introduction of sugar many of the colonies did not\n\nhave a very large black population.\n In fact, the black population was less than that of the white\n\npopulation ( some of the whites were poor indentured servants).\n Because sugar is a labour intensive product that requires much\n\n 'man power' many of the colonies had to rely on heavy\n\nimportation of African labour.\n With this heavy importation of black labour the white indentured\n\nservants were no longer needed and the ratio of blacks to white in the colony\n\nchanged drastically in Haiti the ratio of black to white was 18 to 1.\n\n\nthe ratio to blacks to whites were 44% black / coloured to 56% whites, in\n\n1774, in 1790 to 1820 over 200,000 African slaves were imported and 1821-1831\n\nover 600,000.\n\n\n  The changes in the demographics and social state of the colonies\n\nas a result of the introduction of sugar resulted in  not all\n\nblacks having  equal contact or exposure to the European\n\nlanguage model.\n Thus the rate of acculturation for some blacks was faster than\n\nothers.\n That is, the field slaves who would have had less exposure or contact\n\nto the white colonist European language model would not have acquired the\n\nsame amount of language skills as the house slave who is exposed to it more\n\noften.\n As a result of this the field slave would have maintained more of\n\n their native language vocabulary syntax etc.\n\n  Although Cuba & Barbados also had heavy importation of slaves\n\nlike Haiti, Jamaica and Suriname who each developed a   \n\nCreole  language variety based on a  particular\n\nEuropean lexifier language, we see that the heavy importation of slave labour\n\nand less contact with the white European slave language did not result in a\n\n   Creole  language variety forming in Barbados\n\nand Cuba.\n The factors that probably accounted for this are,\n\nin Cuba and Barbados missionaries and churches provided education for the\n\nslaves and various repressive slave laws meant the end of  certain Africanisms in those societies\n an inclination\n\namong the slaves to assimilate.\n In Cuba, slaves could purchase their freedom and the freedom of their\n\nchildren and could live and work in the city and attend the missionary\n\nschools if they could afford to.\n\n  The heavy importation of slaves would result in new Africans\n\ncoming into the community and bringing with them their African languages and\n\ncultures.\n Thus the constant importation of slaves would have resulted in\n\nkeeping the Africans from assimilating the European language and culture.\n Which is why it is argued that the heavy slave importation that came\n\nto Barbados with  intensive sugar production resulted in the\n\nrecreolization of the language variety there.\n\n  Prior to the introduction of sugar and the expansion of the\n\ncolonies in many Spanish and French colonies, slaves had the opportunity to\n\npurchase their freedom and that of their loved ones but with the constant\n\nimportation of different Africans I  merged as well.\n still keeping Suriname at the centre of the\n\ndiscussion, a language was created by the  <-> murger</-\n\n>merger of Arawok and  'Wayana'.\n\n\n  As historians have put it, there were two waves of migration into\n\nthe Caribbean.\n There was the Arawak migration, followed by the Carib migration.\n themselves to\n\nthe  Greater Antilles and the former occupied the\n\nsmaller island.\n\n  This structure did not happen by chance, but rather it was\n\ncreated out of a significant cultural difference between the Arawaks and\n\nCaribs.\n The Caribs were warlike and would often capture and kill Arawak male\n\nand marry their female.\n One such case of this happen in Dominica and St Vincent.\n\n\n on both island.\n\n\nsyntactic structure, but many Carib words.\n predominantly\n\nto male and others used predominantly to female.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'Education is one means of becoming self actualized in Jamaica.\n mind and character\n\nthrough teaching by way of formal instruction at a school or college level\n\ncomes through education.\n it compulsory\n\nfor the five to sixteen age group to become educated that is they must attend\n\nschool.\n It is also said to be free for that age group.\n The family cannot always afford to educate their children because of\n\neconomic constraints.\n the\n\nsociety as a person strive for self actualization via education.\n\n  Abraham Maslow, the psychologist implied that after the basic\n\nneeds of the human are fulfilled he will then seek for self actualization.\n In Jamaica the family structure seem to comprise of the nuclear family\n\nor Christian, headed by the father, which is the ideal family structure\n\naccording to George P. Murdock, a sociologist, and one of the four functions\n\nof the family is education with respect to socialization.\n The socialization of the human is important for existing in any\n\nsociety.\n Hence the family plays an important role in educating its offsprings.\n For example when parents place magnetic alphabets on the refrigerator\n\nthey have started to educate their children.\n However, there exists other family types.\n compasionate</-\n\n>compassionate family and the  one\'s rise from  illiteracy and poverty to self actualization.\n But education is the key and a most positive means of becoming self\n\nactualized.\n It is socially accepted that education can allow one to reach where\n\nhe wants to reach in life, and that the educated person who have reached self\n\nactualized level will find himself in a  \'good\' social\n\nlevel.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Developing countries can be defined as those countries which are\n\nunable to finance themselves and their citizens  thus,\n\ndepending on external sources for their survival.\n In other words, these countries are poor countries which the\n\nCaribbean is  <- > aparta part.\n Education which is a vital facet of human development is often one of\n\nthe areas neglected by governments of developing countries, due to lack of\n\nresources.\n\n\nth individuals in these developing states are able to gain access\n\nto higher level education.\n Those who are able to obtain advanced level education acquire\n\nexaminations in for example, O\' level and Caribbean Examination Counsel (\n\nCXC).\n There are other individuals who are able to afford a university\n\ndegree or degrees, thus, ensuring that they are on the path that leads to\n\nself actualization.\n\n  In developing states, owing to the fact that limited amount of\n\nfunding is available, not much is invested in building universities and\n\ncolleges.\n For example, at the University of the West Indies Mona and at the\n\nCave Hill Campus students from other developing countries can be found at\n\nthese campuses because they may not have access to universities in their home\n\ncountries.\n There are also other skills which may draw the interests of these\n\nstudents, one such is  technological skills.\n More and more students are pursuing high levels of training in the\n\nfield of computing as a means of self actualization, as well as preparing for\n\nthe job market.\n\n  Most of these educated citizens in the developing countries have\n\nalready perceived in their minds the type of life style they wish to gain.\n\n\nexitingexciting for them.\n however, has reduced\n\nsignificantly after entering the work world.\n Most of the jobs that are available are not what are expected by\n\nthese individuals and thus not self fulfilling.\n Due to the nature and structure of these poor countries, the salaries\n\npaid to these individuals who spent several years studying are not enough to\n\nmeet their needs.\n developing countries are most times over\n\npopulated and therefore not able to create the jobs required by these\n\neducated individuals.\n As mentioned in the definition, these developing countries are not\n\nable to finance their economies efficiently, hence, there is a continuous\n\npattern of slow growth in their economic activities which result in unstable\n\neconomies.\n countries</-\n\n> economic vulnerability, lack of financing and\n\nunstable economies, they have to depend on other rich countries or\n\nindustrialized states, like the United States.\n As a result of this external dependency, these developing countries\n\nhave high external debts and  this problem of high external\n\ndebt payment also reduces the ability of these governments to provide jobs\n\nand salaries which would enhanced self actualization.\n\n  Based on the factors outlined, including others, many citizens\n\nfrom these developing countries have to resort to migration as a means of\n\nself actualization.\n Some of these individuals emigrate to other destinations such as\n\nCanada, the United Kingdom but more so the United  States.\n In those developed countries, these persons are able to obtain a\n\nbetter life for themselves and their family.\n Some individuals, based on their level of education, are able to\n\nobtain two or more jobs, thus acquiring the self fulfillment they hoped for.\n\n\nin educated individuals leave the developing countries, these\n\ndeveloping countries suffer from what is called  \'brain\n\ndrain\'.\n However, on the other hand the highly educated persons think that\n\nmigration is a way of achieving what they want.\n\n  For these developing countries to put in place institutions and\n\norganizations in order to provide the required jobs for these educated\n\nindividuals, they must obtain help from the private sector.\n Most of the individuals from these developing countries do not wish\n\nto migrate but to stay in their home lands and help in their development.\n However, due to the unstable economies they go to other countries to\n\nobtain what is called self actualization.\n\n\n\n \n Thesis statement: In developing countries, self actualization is\n\ndetermined by  one\'s educational level. \x13\n\n\n  Education is viewed as a field of knowledge dealing with the\n\ntechnical aspects of teaching.\n Education not only teaches, but, it disciplines and trains one to\n\ndevelop mentally as well as morally.\nization is explained by the\n\nexistence or importance of an individual.\n These two terms are dependent on each other, in that, self\n\nactualization is determined by  one\'s educational\n\nlevel.\n The question states that these two terms should be related to\n\ndeveloping countries, however, for clarity and conciseness one developing\n\ncountry will be used as an example or model of all developing countries.\n\n  Developing countries are characteristiccally identified by\n\nlow levels of standard of living, low Gross Domestic Product ( GDP) and Gross\n\nNational Product ( GNP) figures as well as high infant mortality rates among\n\nother features.\n In developing countries, there is the existence of stratification.\n stratification is a term used to describe a rank-hierarchy that\n\ngroups individuals with  identical\n\ncharacteristics together.\n Therefore, as implied by the definition whites and blacks are in two\n\nseparate groups, and so is the rich and the poor.\n In developing countries, education is accessible to a relatively\n\nsmall segment of the entire population.\n\n\n  Prestigious social institutions ( schools) are located in high\n\nincome residential areas.\n For example, in Jamaica highly recommendable schools are located\n\n near the Norbrook area and Liganea surroundings, namely\n\nImmaculate conception High school and campion college.\n On the contrary, in low income residential areas technical high\n\nschools, secondary schools and all age schools, are present.\n This depicts that whereas in prestigious institutions the individual\n\nis exposed to the arts and sciences; in the low income residential areas the\n\nschools provide training in wood-work and cosmetology \x13 to name a few.\n It must be noted that erstwhile in Jamaica, the Common Entrance\n\nExamination ( C.EE.) done in preparatory, primary and all age schools placed\n\nstudents in schools located nearest to them.\n Therefore, this examination maintained stratification and class\n\nstruggle between the rich and poor in the developing society.\n In addition, the government have implemented a fairly new examination\n\nnamed the Grade six Scholar Achievement Test ( GSAT), this was done to  aid in eradicating stratification in contemporary Jamaica.\n This is so because children from Tivoli Gardens \x13 a low income\n\nresidential ( LIR) area in Jamaica \x13 were now granted the opportunity to\n\nattend schools in high income residential ( H.I.R) areas.\n In other words, they could now attend traditional high schools.\n Therefore, individuals from L.I.R areas were able to experience a\n\n " better" education and hence a broader field of career\n\nopportunities that are relatively high paying.\n The term " " better education"" is used in the sense\n\nthat one would be able to achieve a higher secondary education and possibly a\n\n teritarytertiary education.\n\n  higher paying jobs\n\nare associated with a high levels of education, in a general sense.\n Therefore, students who have achieved a degree from the University of\n\nWest Indies ( U.W.I.) will, in most cases, reap higher salaries than those\n\nwho have only a primary education as well as a secondary education.\n This is representative of the picture trying to be painted throughout\n\nthis essay \x13 that high levels of education yield high earnings, a high\n\nstandard of living and so a high self actualization within the developing\n\nworld.\n\n  there are exceptions to every\n\nrule and so few people in the developing countries are able to achieve a\n\nreputable self actualization without a  " proper" education.\n\n\nentrepeneursentrepreneurs.\n An example that would clearly depict this is Mr. Matalon.\n has achieved\n\na high status  not only within the Jamaican society but\n\nin the Caribbean and the world, to a lesser extent.\n Matalon did not achieve a secondary education, however, he owns the\n\nfamous Sandals hotel resorts as well as Air Jamaica.\n Additionally, entertainers such as Rodney Price, alias Bounty Killer\n\nis presently living in a relatively H.I.R. area Constant Spring and is\n\nbuilding a base in Norbrook a H.I.R.\n His singing career has granted him money that was able to make him\n\nexperience upward social mobility ( moving from a lower strata to an upper\n\nstrata) and as a consequence a higher self actualization than if he did not\n\nsing and had remained living in seaview Gardens \x13 a L.I.R. area \x13 where his\n\nself actualization would be

{'text': "This essay looks at the condition under which Caribbean Creole\n\nlanguages developed.\n It discusses the sociohistorical backgrounds of Haiti, Jamaica and\n\nCuba in an attempt to show how the different histories of these Islands may\n\nhave given rise to different linguistic results.\n Its aim is to suggest reasons for the development of creole in two of\n\nthese islands and not in the other.\n\n  century,\n\nColumbus discovered the West Indies, which he so named.\n This discovery led to the occupation and colonization of these islands\n\nby European countries such as Spain, England, and France.\n These European countries occupied and fought over both countries in\n\nthe greater and the lesser Antilles.\n The hope of finding gold and/or precious stones in these territories\n\nwere dashed to  <- > peicespieces so the Europeans\n\nintroduce crops to the islands.\n\n  The first profitable crop introduced to most island was the\n\ncultivation of tobacco.\n This crop needed only a small labour force and was grown by small\n\nplanters as well as large landowners.\n Labour was a constant problem in the early colonization of the\n\nCaribbean territories, thus white labour was encouraged even  Indians should be enslaved and on the suggestion of one\n\nof his advisors turned to the African Coast for black, to fill the need for a\n\nlabour force.\n The other Europeans did likewise, thus, during the cultivation of\n\ntobacco period, the labour force consisted of European indentured servants,\n\nblack slave and in some instances Amerindians.\n\n \n\nbecause due to different factors.\n The Africans were discouraged from using their own language, which\n\nwas often difficult  for them to maintain since different\n\ntribes and language groups were given no consideration.\n Frankly the European preferred to put different speakers together to\n\nminimize plotting among the Africans against the whites.\n It was therefore necessary for the Blacks to learn the language of\n\ntheir masters, without it being taught to them, thus the genesis of the\n\nlanguages that have come to be know as the creole languages of the\n\nCaribbean.\n\n  It was easier for the blacks to learn the language of their\n\nmasters during the period of tobacco production  because the contact between whites and blacks were\n\ncloser.\n\n\nlarge small in the early periods as can be seen in the history of \n\n<- > BarbadoesBarbados.\n On this island there were approximately 40,000 whites to six\n\nthousands blacks before the sugar boom.\n\n  With the introduction of sugar cane the demand of labour became\n\ngreater and the importation of blacks escalated in the islands.\n Contact with the European languages became more remote as the slave\n\npopulations grew.\n on the islands influenced\n\nthe growth of the  Creole towards the\n\nstandard.\n\n  Jamaica which was owned by both the Spanish\n\nand the English a  Creole developed.\n\n\ncreoleCreole is developed through the French occupation of\n\nthat country.\n Cuba however, which was owned solely by the Spaniards except for a\n\nbrief one year period by the English, developed no creole language.\n\n \n\ncreoleCreole due to its long occupation by the English until\n\nit gained independence.\n The colonization period of Jamaica by the English showed a marked\n\ndistancing between the whites and the blacks.\n The island's slaves from the early periods vastly outnumbered the\n\nwhites and the English slave masters in the island had minimal contact with\n\nthe vast  majority of their slaves\n lack of contact effected the development of\n\nan  <-> English based</- >English-based  Creole which is further removed from the Standard than\n\nthat of say,  Creole.\n Large number of slaves were imported on the island.\n\n\npracticed racism and had very little social contact with the blacks.\n islands, the more slaves the less\n\n contact with the standard.\n The social practice also did not foster contact and the coloured (\n\nmixed blood) of Haiti showed the same or perhaps more hatred for the blacks\n\nthan the white French.\n These people of mixed blood had closer contact with the standard\n\n and spoke a variety of French but the  <-> creole</-\n\n>Creole developed by the blacks ceased to grow towards the\n\nstandard.\n early in Haiti did\n\nnot enhance the growth of the  despised.\n no access to the standard and very little\n\nmotivation to learn it.\n\n \n\ndid not develop because the social practices of the Spaniards were different\n\ntowards the slaves.\n Cuba tried at first to keep the slave population down even though\n\nthis could not be maintained in the sugar production era.\n The slave population grew but the Spaniards treated their slaves much\n\nbetter than the treatment of the slaves on both Haiti and Jamaica.\n The Spaniards feared slave uprising and maintained a close contact\n\nwith them.\n initially developed the\n\nsocial practices and treatment of the slaves  effected a\n\nlanguage that is not considered  Creole even \n\nthough it has the  island share\n\nhistory with many of the other Caribbean islands that developed and\n\nmaintained a creole language.\n\n \n\n  The Amerindians who occupied both the Greater and the lesser\n\nAntilles in the West Indies were said to have been natives of larger land\n\nmasses such as South America because of evidences of their occupation that\n\nare found.\n There is however no evidence to link these peoples directly to a\n\nparticular area of origination.\n\n  When these people were discovered it was found that they were of\n\ntwo major races, Arawaks and Caribs.\n The Caribs were a fierce warlike race that raided the Arawak villages\n\nperiodically.\n They would capture the women of the villages and kill the males.\n Their practice was to take the women as wives mainly.\n These Arawak women spoke a different language from their mates.\n The males in each community would think of their Carib language as\n\nthe language of the men while the women spoke a different language.\n\n  led to\n\na number of Arawakan languages  and Carib languages.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  ( a) assimilation of the European lang. by the Indians in a\n\nnumber of cases.\n\n  <p\n\n<\n\n\n\n\n \n\nand as well as the other European nations which followed, the region\n\nwas inhabited by different tribes of Indians referred to as Amerindians.\n These tribes occupied different territories and pursued their\n\nlivelihood often at the expense of other tribes.\n\n  In the West Indies, the Arawaks speaking Arawakan and or Taino\n\nsettled in the islands of the Greater Antilles ( Jamaica, Cuba, Puerto Rico,\n\nHispaniola) and the Bahama Islands while the warlike Caribs speaking Cariban\n\nsettled in the islands of the Lesser Antilles except in Trinidad.\n attacked\n\nthe Arawaks chasing them up the chain of islands capturing their women who\n\nwere kept as wives and eating/killing the men.\n\n  It was therefore no surprise that both Carib and Arawak languages\n\nwere present in the Carib society with that of the Arawaks being the language\n\nof the women-folk and the first language of the children.\n On the other hand Carib language remained largely the language of the\n\nmale in the society.\n\n  In other territories especially those of Central and South\n\nAmerica where enemy tribes were raided  the captured  were enslaved and the language of the captors ( for example\n\nQuechica or the Inca in Peru) became the language of the captured or slaves\n\nwere allowed to use their native language to ensure easy identification\n\n  It was therefore an era of monolingualism but bilingualism\n\nexisted to some extent.\n The appearance of Columbus/the Spanish and other Europeans\n\ndrastically changed this linguistic situation.\n Their entrance disrupted the lives of these indigenous peoples to the\n\nextent that in many cases the inhabitants all died ( were decimated) and\n\ntherefore caused language death.\n The Arawakan language Taino said to be spoken in Jamaica was one such\n\nexample as none of its speakers survived the European conquest.\n In some cases where living speakers remained, there have been changes\n\nin the original language itself or a creolised form and the original\n\nlanguages have retreated to informal and private domains.\n As a matter of fact, the languages which were affected in this way\n\nwould be now under threat of extinction if the younger generations do not see\n\nit as important to their life and survival.\n\n  European conquest on the whole meant that these tribes of peoples\n\nwould be enslaved or put to work to discover the gold and other precious\n\nmetals that these Europeans at first sought.\n This situation, though similar to previous era in the lives of the\n\nIndians, in that it was again a time of conquest and contact was also very\n\ndifferent.\n\n  lost control of their lives\n\nand with this was the loss of control  over their language.\n For effective communication then, these Indians had to learn the\n\nlanguage of the conquering nations ( depending on the nation which conquered\n\nthe tribe).\n This caused a relexifying of their original languages where Spanish\n\nwords infiltrated and were helpful in allowing one to understand the\n\nother.\n\n  Subsequently, bilingualism would have developed to some extent\n\nalong with a pidgin for effective communication.\n From this point, the Indians would have ( with length of stay of\n\nEuropean power) become monolingual speaking only the languages of the nations\n\nwhich established colonies and had remained in the territory for a long\n\nperiod of time.\n\n  Conquest and the absence of precious metals was\n\nlater\n\n  Success was achieved through conquest but the absence of precious\n\nmetals especially in the islands of the West Indies led to the setting up of\n\ncolonies \x13 ( permanent settlements).\n Again these indigenous peoples were overworked and many died from\n\nthis as well as from diseases introduced by the Europeans.\n It therefore did not take long for many of these peoples to disappear\n\ncompletely as many were killed in  earlier battles of conquest\n\nresisting the newcomers.\n\n  It is therefore no surprise that Indian languages survived to a\n\ngreater extent on the Mainland territories than in the islands as these\n\npeoples could have retreated to the Hilly / forested areas given the fact\n\nthat the mainland has larger land masses.\n Conversely the remaining speakers and descendants of Arawaks and\n\nCaribs are few.\n\n  'Black\n\nCaribs'.\n These are the descendants of the last of the Caribs of St. Vincent (\n\nwho resisted European domination) and negroes who having been shipwrecked\n\nsought refuge there.\n The language spoken originally by the Caribs is a mixture of Carib\n\nand African.\n These were deported to Belize where their language one Island Carib\n\nbecame Black Carib or Garifuna.\n\n  There are remnants of the Arawaks still living in Guyana where\n\ntheir language Arawakan is used at home and for religious festivities.\n Their offsprings therefore would become bilingual as they are in\n\norder to fit into the new society.\n The Indians of the Mainland ( Central and South America) were able to\n\n preserve their way of life and their language as the\n\nSpanish who occupied most of these territories did not begin to develop\n\ncolonies as early as the British and others.\n They therefore were able to survive linguistically though\n\nrelexification and bilingualism would have resulted.\n\n  Conquest of one Indian tribe by another resulted in the\n\nmaintenance in the conquered's language to some extent.\n On the other hand conquest of Indians by Europeans largely resulted\n\nin the death or  near death of the language of the Indians.\n This latter conquest changed ( eventually) the linguistic landscape\n\nof the West Indies forever as not only were most Indian languages erased (\n\nthose of Greater Antilles) but the introduction of Africans created a new mix\n\nand eventually a new language system that of Creole.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '18dbd711-4ad4-4780-9d1c-c44db43adcd5', 'added':

to satisfy the requirement for question formation.\n of\n\ncase from " go" and &THETA; role from "\n\ngo".\n\n  Whereas passive movement is needed so that the Noun Phrase or\n\nmove entity will receive case in  wh-movement the moved entity did not move to get case and\n\nso the original position or trace receives case as well as &THETA; role.\n Whereas the morphology of the verb is affected in passive movement\n\nthe morphology of the verb is not affected in wh-movement.\n The auxiliary in wh-movement is affected as it is moved to a\n\npre-subject position\n Movement is needed in both wh- movement and passive movement to\n\nfulfil the requirements needed for ( i) case assignment in passive and\n\ncorrect word order in wh.\n\n\n\n  Passive movement entails a number of properties.\n In looking at a passive sentence in English the first thing to note\n\nis that unlike active sentences the verb is affected in that it exist in the\n\nform of a participial with the use of the verb " \x1dto be\x1d" in\n\nthe form of an auxiliaries.\n One would therefore see as in the example given " \x1cwas\n\nprovided\x1d".\n " \x1dWas\x1d" being the auxiliary and "\n\nprovided" being the past participle.\n When attempting any kind of movement as regards to passives a number\n\nof features or properties becomes evident.\n\n\nexclusively.\n\n\n  The morphology of the verb is affected.\n The verb in passives are not marked for tense as in the example cited\n\nabove verb exists in a participial form along with an auxiliary.\n Again in the example provided the verb exist in the past participle \x13\n\n" \x1cwho + provided\x1d".\n\n  Another property of passive movement is that the verb is unable\n\nto assign the external  argument which is normally the\n\nagent and usually occurs in subject position.\n It is said in the literature that its theta assigning ability has\n\nbeen absorbed.\n argument structure\n\nof the verb provided would be  realized in one, the\n\n \x1cagent\x1d, that being " \x1cthe commuters\x1d" and\n\nthe  \x1ctheme\x1d the thing being provided.\n In an active sentence the agent would normally be present in subject\n\nposition or as an external argument.\n\n\nat the end in a phrase introduced by " \x1cfor\x1d".\n The property of passives of the verb not being able to assign\n\nexternal theta role must be taken care of in that " \x1cthe\n\ncommuters\x1d" being the agent and hence the external argument must be\n\nmoved into its correct position.\n This is accommodated by the fact that the agent position was empty\n\nand can therefore accept the move.\n After this movement a trace is shown and this is shown with the use\n\nof co-indexing as can be seen in the given example.\n\n ty.\n the verb is also\n\nbecause of its lack of finite  is unable to assign case.\n Once again the literature says that its case assigning ability has\n\nbeen absorbed because of the participial form of the verb.\n The fact that the agent that being " \x1cthe\n\ncom<l>muters\x1d" was moved into the ex<l>ternal argument position.\n\n\ninfl\x1d.\n\n\ninfl or inflection  on the verb "\n\n\x1dprovide\x1d".\n\n\n  \x1dThe commuters were provided with a new\n\nbus-stop\x1d.\n\n  The argument structure of the verb " provide"\n\nhere constitutes an agent and theme.\n The agent being " the commuters" and the theme being\n\nthe " \x1cbus-stop\x1d".\n The first noun-phrase would then get case because of this\n\nmovement.\n\n  Other properties of passive movement is that movement is\n\nobligatory.\n Movement must occur so that noun phrases get structural case.\n movement occurs trace which is\n\nvisible exist and is represented by co-indexing.\n\n \n\n  Unlike passive movement argument structure is fully realized in\n\nthe interrogative sentence.\n\n\nauxillaryauxiliary is moved into  pre-subject and  <-> auxillary</-\n\n>auxiliary positions respectively.\n What is produced are interrogative sentences with the\n\nwh-constituent.\n These include the " what", " who",\n\n" why" and so on words.\n\n  It is noticeable that at the D-structure level the\n\nwh-constituent is present so the given example would read as follows at the\n\ndeep structure level\n new\n\nbus-stops for who?\x1d\n\n ment is that the "\n\n\x1cwho\x1d" would be moved into word initial position in the sentence.\n Since " \x1cwho\x1d" occupied the noun phrase at the end\n\nof the sentence a trace would be left.\n " \x1dWho\x1d" is then placed into the specifier position\n\nof the sentence.\n\n\n  "\n\n\x1dhave\x1d" would then be moved into  \x1cC\x1d position.\n This is so because wh-movement dictates that head-to-head movement\n\nmust occur so hence the  <-> auxillary</- >auxiliary "\n\n\x1dhave\x1d" must be placed under  \x1cC\x1d.\n With this movement a chain is also established and\n\nhence  \x1ct\x1d for trace is written with the use of\n\nco-indexing.\n\n  In the literature it has been said that chains and traces must\n\nbe shown or made visible because it is through traces that the noun phrase\n\nwill get its structural case.\nortant as syntactic theory states that every noun\n\nphrase must be assigned a theta-role and case.\n\n  In concluding movement is very necessary in syntax.\n It was seen that in passive movement for the noun phrase to be\n\nassigned case, movement was necessary since the ability of the verb to do so\n\nwas absorbed.\n Because of the movement the verb was able to assign the agent or\n\nexternal argument.\nssary so to form the\n\ninterrogative sentence and hence  allow for the\n\nassigning of case through trace.\n\n  Theta theory for a fact claims that the meaning of a word is\n\nreflected in its argument structure.\n This theory states that every noun phrase must be assigned a theta\n\nrole.\ndicates in sentences\n\nidentifying the activity of the predicate; based on this noun phrases are\n\nassigned specific theta roles.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL',

{'text': 'Thesis statement: Some religious organization in Jamaica has\n\nbecome more materialistic because they spend more time Promoting fund raising\n\nevents rather than engage in worship.\n\n  It is said that for every square mile in Jamaica there can be\n\nfound a church and days gone by the church was the foundation of a community.\n Worship was one of the most integral aspect in a Jamaican\'s life.\n It was the background of our culture.\n; religion has\n\ntake on for itself a new role.\n A role that has crept upon us so suddenly, it took us completely off\n\nguard.\n Religion now has a new approach, a materialistic one, which seems to\n\nbe spreading like wild fire.\n Some religions are deeply involved while others are just catching-on.\n\n\n \n\nof the many improvements in technology.\n There are so many development on the various gadgets that people uses\n\nboth in the homes, offices and event musical instruments that are used by\n\nchurch bands.\n There is always some new equipment that seems to be better than the\n\nones that was made before and this is promoted by advertisers in ways that\n\nmakes them appealing to the eyes of individuals.\n\n  To acquire these things though, money is needed and so churches\n\nwould need funds.\n Voluntary contribution alone will not help to make bigger building\n\n maintenance of the church building and various\n\nother services that has to be paid for in order to keep the organization\n\nrunning.\n\n  Religious organizations have to engage in other area to make\n\nmoney.\n They cannot rely upon contributions from their members again,\n\ntherefore they have seen where they excell in the entertainment field and so\n\nthey begin to keep gospel concerts and collect a small fee  from\n\npersons who like this sort of music.\n This has grown into a big event.\n Every year in Jamaica an island wide gospel stage show is held at the\n\nStadium or National Arena and gospel entertainers from different parts of the\n\nworld come to take part.\n over\n\nwhelmingoverwhelming that even  <- > non\n\nChristiannon-Christian, DJs and other entertainers have\n\nswitched from their former life styles and have turned to a  "\n\nChristian life style".\n "\n\nGodly" way of life through music.\n But it is said that some of them are in it solely for the money.\n Other Christians have also engage in talent contest where it is said\n\nthat they represent their churches and if they win the money will go to the\n\nchurch.\n\n  There is a popular gospel contest that is featured yearly in\n\nJamaica and Christians from most of the religious organization compete for\n\nthe prize packages.\n Other Christians go as for as making gospel albums and to justify it\n\nthey say they are doing the  "  <- > LordsLord\'s\n\nWork".\n\n  When religious organizations are engaged or involved in these\n\nvarious money making schemes it shows  how they\n\nhave lost the true essence of what religion should be.\n Yes, some people will be drawn to various religious organization but\n\nthis could be because of the entertainment that is offered and not because of\n\ntheir teachings.\n People are always drawn to music especially if it is pleasing to\n\ntheir ears.\n\n  a\n\nmistrust because they will realize that those who preach to them lack true\n\nfaith.\n They are not sincere and are only trying to gather members in order\n\nto gain more funds.\n Lack of faith in religion creates lack of faith in the morals that\n\nthe Bible teaches because of the in<l>sincere persons who are teachers of the\n\ngospel.\n\n\n  As mentioned before some religion in Jamaica has taken on a\n\nmaterialistic approach.\n People of Jamaica are being misguided by some of the religious\n\norganizations which only seek to get more members by engaging in various\n\nentertainment venues.\n non\n\nchristiansnon-Christians who do not really want to serve God\n\nbut to gain more material wealth for themselves.\n\n\nturned misguided a lot of persons from the true meaning of\n\nreligion.\n\n\n\n  Mankind has always been interested in and somehow feels the need\n\nto aspire towards a  \'Supreme being\' who he claims created him\n\nand the universe, and therefore he needs to worship him.\n The phenomenon is called religion.\n Religion may be defined as the systematic belief in and worship of a\n\nSupreme deity or deities.\n Karl Marx, one of the world\'s great philosophist describes religion\n\nas the,  " opium of the people", probably because of the\n\naddictive nature of religion and man\'s feeling that he needs to worship this\n\nbeing or face all the negative consequences that follow.\n Religion should evolve and has evolved in visible ways, even in\n\nJamaica in the year 2000.\n Jamaica is a peculiar island, having the most churches per square\n\nmile in the world and no doubt with this record, it is safe to say that\n\nreligion has changed in many way on the island.\n\n  Jamaica is noted for presently having many religious groups and\n\ndenominations.\n But this was not always so.\n\n\nnegrosnegroes from Africa began, the Europeans who claim to be\n\ndiscoverers of the Western world brought Catholicism with them.\n Being the only religion known to the inhabitants at the time, they\n\nalong with the Africans who later came were exposed to Christianity and\n\nChristianity alone and suddenly all their practices were gingerly put\n\naside.\n\n \n\nPresbyterians and Baptists.\n There are also relatively new groups like the Pentecostals and\n\nAdventists and other non-traditional groups like the Jehovah witnesses,\n\nChristian scientists and the Kingston Church of Christ.\n restricted to\n\ndoctrinal matters but has increasingly become involved in the music industry\n\nand the social welfare of its followers and others.\n\n  groups are different in some\n\ndoctrinal matter,  lifestyle and worship.\n The traditional Christian groups are more reserved in their worship\n\nand are less noisy.\n and believe in\n\nmaking a joyful noise unto the Lord as recorded in book of Psalms.\n They can be divided in two groups; the Church of God who believe in\n\nthree revelations of God and the Apostolic who believe there is\n\nOne God ( Monotheistic).\n\n\nChristians use the  " Bible" as their holy book.',

trends.\n In the field of entertainment, particularly the music arena, there\n\nhas emerged in recent years what is \n\ntermed a  " dancehall" fad.\n It is characterized by predominantly a young, gaudily dressed\n\nindividual with a  fondness for a music form,\n\nwhich oftentimes exemplifies violence and lewdness.\n This dancehall fad often attracts a number of innercity youths to\n\nbecome  disc jockeys ( DJs), of a music\n\nform which largely promotes vulgarity and lewdness.\n\n  Although reggae was made universally acceptable by Bob Marley,\n\ninnercity youths considered this  \'mento\' rhythm irrelevant to\n\ntheir cultural expressions, experiences, aspirations and lifestyles in the\n\nghetto.\n They instead saw the sound system culture as an alternative music\n\nform.\n Consequently, the dancehall phenomenon was accompanied by new\n\nattitudes, which brought about a revolution in social behaviour, dress,\n\nsuggestive dance moves and violent obscene lyrics.\n\n  The lyrics often describe the female in a derogatory manner.\n\n\nword</unclear>  \'gal\' and nerve  \'fire\'.\n This is manifested by violence seen in schools, where students are\n\neven fighting teachers.\n The songs depict life in the ghetto as the lyricist knows it whose\n\nlife is tough.\n\n  world wide</-\n\n>worldwide appeal, and for those DJs on the international circuit,\n\nthe rewards are quite lucrative.\n This makes it attractive to youths who no longer want to graduate\n\nfrom school, but opt for the fast lane to fame and fortune by becoming DJs.\n Nevertheless, others turn to it because of the hopelessness in\n\nseeking regular employment.\n\n \n\nand expensive, it is difficult to understand how the average innercity youths\n\nafford it, without any visible gainful employment.\n It sometimes lends to an informal type of prostitution, which carries\n\nwith it the attendant social and medical ills.\n Notwithstanding, the gaudy dancehall dress for many is mainly a\n\nstatement of identity.\n\n  The unfortunate consequence arising from this culture is the\n\nproblems of disruptive,  overly loud noise to\n\nattached neighbourhoods.\n At these sessions roads are sometimes blocked.\n accidentally causes any\n\ndisturbance to a session could lose his life as with the  motorists on\n\nSpanish Town Road and in Montego Bay.\n This is the extent of the barbarisms and uncivil behaviour the fad\n\ngenerates from innercity youths.\n\n  Despite the evils of this fad, it is still popular and cable\n\noperations even dedicate at least one channel featuring fashionable partners\n\n " bubbling" to the latest dance nerves.\n is this type of\n\ndancehall fad, that it has even begun to influence the type of gospel music\n\nnow heard.\n\n  It is regrettable that the lyrics could demean and cause youths\n\nto have wrong values and improper self esteem.\n They seek to bleach themselves, a reality initiated by lyrics from\n\n Buju Bantu\'s popular song   " mi luv mi  car, mi\n\nbike, mi money and ting, but most of all mi luv mi  <unclear>\n\nword</unclear>&dotted- line;".\n\n\nhormone pills intended for chickens to enhance the size of their breasts and\n\nbottoms.\n and influence DJs\n\nhave on the youths.\n\n  There is not doubt that the dancehall culture is a popular fad\n\nwith musical expressions which could have positive influence on youths if\n\ncleaned up.\n However, in order for this to happen, uplifting values and clean\n\nlyrics need to be expressed.\n\n\ncan be cleansed by  eliminating the  \'gun\',\n\n \'fire burn\' and violent lyrics.\n\n  We should instead seek to glorify the heroes and the positive\n\naspects of our culture.\n\n\nword</unclear> Walsh.\n should refuse to play\n\nsongs exalting gunmen who continue to reek

mechanisms have also caused most of the members of modern\n\nsocieties to undermine various important issues and to act in a manner\n\ndefined as  " wrong" by society.\n Technology ( radios, televisions, computers, telephones) has caused\n\nmost of the people of the modern world to be too lackadaisical while at the\n\nsame time this encourages deviant behaviour.\n\n  The telephone acts as a medium for time wasting and threats.\n Due to the fact that most people spend hours on the telephone other\n\nimportant tasks are left undone.\n For example, in a typical family one involving parents and children,\n\nit is seen where both parents and children abuse the telephone.\n Mothers especially spend countless hours on the telephone talking to\n\nfriends about trivial issues while the house needs tending to.\n This results in a dirty house, no dinner for the husband and\n\nchildren.\n Such behaviour is seen as complacency and there is no sense of\n\norderliness as was present before.\n As with the children they too spend hours on the telephone while the\n\nhomework is left undone.\n Sociologists would term such behaviour as that of a delinquent as\n\nwhen school work is

as a result we increased the area by approximately 200\n\nsq. ft., therefore the revised area is 1,400 sq. ft.\n\n \n\n  ( approx.\n\n$2,925.00 per sq. ft.)<space> - <space>\n\n$4,100,000.00\n\n \n\n \n\n$4,300,000.00\n\n  As will be seen the approximate construction per square foot is\n\nright on the\n\n$3,000 marker.\n There is also a need for a contingency sum to be put in place.\n Even though the cost of concrete work for beam, columns, slab and\n\nblock wall are more or less fixed, the variable cost would be the finishes\n\nthat will be used e.g. types of floor finishes, finishes for counters,\n\nbathroom fixtures and fittings, etc.\n\n\n  The design of the building ( extension) will be presented at the\n\nnext Grounds, Building Committee meeting which is on December 4, 2000.\n From our meeting, however, it was my understanding that the Principal\n\nhad given approval for the erection of this building.\n\n\n  Since time is of the essence, we are proceeding with the\n\nconstruction drawing which is still expected to be completed by the end of\n\nNovember.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n , Head,\n\nLanguage and Linguistics\n\n , Superintendent of\n\nWorks\n\n \n\n  THE COMPUTER\n\nWRITING CENTRE\n\n  Please be advised that the Grounds, Building and Premises\n\nCommittee has formally approved the construction of the Computer Writing\n\nCentre.\n\n  As such The Projects Office will now proceed with the\n\nimplementation of the various activities for the execution of the works.\n\n  Please note that I will be revising the schedule which will be\n\npresented to you.\n\n  On another matter, members of the committee are recommending that\n\nthe name be changed from Computer Writing Centre to, let's say  \x1dThe\n\nWriting Centre\x1d.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGlendon Construction Limited, for the execution of work for the captioned\n\nproject in the sum of\n\n$5,436,456.00, for a construction period of three months.\n\n  Initially, the budget for this project was\n\n$4,500,000.00, however, due to the anticipated future \n\n\x1cvertical\x1d expansion, a number of modifications and alterations had\n\nto be factored in to ensure that this could be met \x13 hence the increase in\n\ncost.\n\n\n \n\n  The foundation is designed to accommodate three storeys.\n This is justifiable since it is envisaged to expand the building\n\nvertically, which would not consume the limited green area on the Campus.\n It should also be noted that this building will be extended off the\n\nexisting building  \x1cLibrary of the Spoken Word\x1d, which is\n\nthree storeys.\n\n \n\n  Adequate provision for future use of electrical and incoming\n\nwater supply have been incorporated in the present design so that minimal\n\ninfra-structural work will be needed for the future expansion.\n\n \n\n  Sufficient provision for future use of the LAN connection for\n\ninter-intra Campus connectivity has been incorporated into the present design\n\nso that minimal infra-structural work will be needed for the future\n\nexpansion.\n\n  Initially, the contractor had submitted his tender document in\n\nthe sum of\n\n$6,402,060.20 for a construction period of three months.\n The Quantity Surveyors estimate presented was\n\n$5,581,825.00, a difference of\n\n$820,235.00.  Following several intense discussions, we were able to\n\nagree at the figure of\n\n$5,436,456.00, which is\n\n$145,369.00 lower than the Quantity Surveyor's estimate.\n\n  In short the total figure negotiated off the contractor's\n\noriginal figure is\n\n$965,604.00.  The contractor has shown an interest to commence work\n\nimmediately once the contract has been awarded.\n If this is done during the course of this week, into early next\n\nweek, the project will be completed before the new academic year begins \x13\n\nthus ensuring the need for new and returning students to be able to have this\n\nfacility to be used which will greatly assist them in their writing\n\nskills.\n\n  I therefore seek your budgetary approval for this project so\n\nthat we may commence work and be completed in a timely manner.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Letter of Acceptance \x13 Construction of Computer\n\nWriting Centre\n\n \n\n  The University of the West Indies, Mona campus wishes to inform\n\nyou that the revised offer presented by your firm,   GLENDON\n\nConstruction Limited has been accepted to carry out construction of\n\nthe Computer Writing Centre in the Department of Language and Linguistics in\n\nthe negotiated sum of  Five Million, Four Hundred and Thirty Six\n\nThousand, Four Hundred and Fifty Six Dollars (\n\n$5,436,456.00), with a construction period of three ( 3) months from\n\nthe date of commencement.\n\n  Pursuant to condition of contract, you should furnish the\n\nemployer with the following:\n\n  A work programme that should clearly outline the\n\nCritical Path Method of how the work will be executed.\n\n \n\n  Performance bond in accordance with Clause 38-\n\nAdditional Clauses\n\n  Appropriate Insurance Coverage in accordance with\n\nClauses 18, 19 & 20a\n\n  You are required to acknowledge receipt of this Letter of\n\nAcceptance by returning a signed copy to the Superintendent of Works,\n\nProjects Office, Credit Union Building U.W.I.

{'text': "Annual Staff Development Workshop\n\n\x13 Student Learning And Development<space>: A Collaborative\n\nApproach\n\n  Seminars and\n\nWorkshop, presentations by the President of the Jamaica Employers Federation\n\nand other corporate persons, underscored the holistic approach to student\n\nlearning and development by emphasizing the  \x1cCompetence\n\nSkills\x1d that employers expect a graduate from tertiary institutions,\n\nto<space> possess.\n\n  The skills identified can best be achieved if Faculty and Student\n\nServices Practitioners collaborate, so that student out-of-classroom learning\n\nexperiences, will complement classroom learning.\n\n  To meet the world of work challenges, UWI, Mona in collaboration\n\nwith the Caribbean Tertiary Level Personnel Association ( CLTPA) will be\n\nhosting a two day residential workshop at Golf View Hotel from June 26-28,\n\n1998.\n The Workshop is designed to identify strategies for collaborative\n\nstudent learning and methods of implementing the strategies.\n\n , Vice\n\nPresident, Student Affairs at Bridgewater State College and President of the\n\nAmerican College Personnel Association ( ACPA).\n someone who\n\nhas written and presented many papers on Collaborative Student Learning.\n\n  You, as well as selected members of your staff are specially\n\ninvited to attend the workshop.\n Included is a brochure which gives additional information on the\n\nworkshop.\n\n  To assist in our planning we ask that you indicate your\n\nacceptance by returning the attached application form to the Office of\n\nStudent Services by June 5,1998.\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Public Statements and Research\n\nEthics\n\n  As some of you may be aware the University of the West Indies has\n\nan established policy on research ethics which deals with issues of giving\n\naccurate and appropriate credit for work done, falsification of data and\n\nplagiarism, dispute resolution and a number of other matters affecting the\n\nconduct of researchers, whether Faculty or student.\n A copy of the document is attached to this memorandum for easy\n\nreference.\n\n\n  An aspect of this matter which I wish to bring to your urgent\n\nattention is that of public statements and publications which are issued by\n\nUniversity agencies, Faculty or students giving information about research\n\nprojects and related activities taking place at the University to the general\n\npublic.\n It is of the utmost importance that any such information be accurate\n\nand that great pains are taken to ensure that credit for work being done is\n\naccurate, appropriate and complete.\n This is especially important in these times since issues of\n\nintellectual property rights are invariably at stake and often also theses of\n\ngraduate students may be involved.\n\n  Recent experience suggests that it is surprisingly easy for\n\nerrors, omissions, and ambiguous photographs of research activities to be\n\ninadvertently published in the course of the laudable efforts to publicize\n\nour work.\n We cannot be too careful on these matters as they are very difficult\n\nto correct after the fact and can have very severe repercussions on us\n\nall.\n\n  I therefore take this opportunity to invite you to exercise the\n\nutmost caution on these matters.\n Any intended publication on research activity must be carefully\n\nvetted by the Faculty member(s) ( and graduate students where appropriate)\n\nconcerned.\n The parties directly involved should make a written confirmation to\n\nthe Public Relations ( or relevant office) that to the best of her/his\n\nknowledge it is accurate, appropriate and complete.\n It is also highly advisable that copies of correspondence on these\n\nissues be kept on file.\n Directors and Heads of Departments have a special responsibility to\n\nensure that this is done.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Re: Publications for Research\n\nDay</italics>\n\n \n\n  As you may be aware of by now, one of the major outputs for\n\nResearch Day 1998 at Mona will be the production of two documents on research\n\nundertaken at our institution.\n\n  The first document will be a bibliography monograph, which the\n\nLibrary has kindly undertaken to produce, and which will have detailed\n\nlistings of all staff publications at the University over the last five\n\nyears.\n\n  The other document will be an up-market publication, which will\n\nsummarise in a historical perspective, the significant research associated\n\nwith the University during its fifty-year existence.\n\n  In order to have the most up-to-date information available for\n\nboth publications, I would like to appeal for your help in collecting all the\n\npublished works of the past five years from your faculty staff.\n These should be deposited in the Main Library by September 10, 1998,\n\nfor the attention of Mrs.  Nancy King.\n\n  I would appreciate your urgent attention on this matter, in order\n\nfor you to be able to review the documents before publication, and for us to\n\nbe able to meet the publishing deadlines.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  I have just received a list of the projects submitted in response\n\nto the request for proposals to be incorporated into the university's\n\npresentation to the IDB/CDB for a new loan agreement, and have had the\n\nopportunity to read most of them.\n\n  The projects represent a wide range of very important work which\n\nthe Mona campus should be engaging in over the next few years.\n Thank you very much for the effort which you put into developing\n\nthese proposals, at very short notice, and for identifying such significant\n\nareas for research and development.\n\n  The outcome of the IDB/CDB proposal will not be known for some\n\ntime, and some of these projects may not be selected to be part of that\n\nprogramme.\n\n\nme with the nucleus of a Mona Campus Research and Development Programme for\n\nwhich I hope to be able to obtain some funding support.\n\n  I look forward to working with you to ensure that your proposals\n\nreceive the funding necessary to facilitate their success.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Thank you for agreeing to meet with me and to discuss matters\n\nrelating to ( i) the staffing of the department and ( ii) the physical plant\n\nof the department.\n This is my attempt to record the proposals, which I put to you and\n\nyour responses.\n\n \n\n  We would be allowed to proceed to advertise for the two currently\n\nvacant positions in the English Language Section, in addition to the one due\n\nto become vacant on the retirement of Mr.  Edward Queen in 2001.\n The same would apply to the two currently vacant posts in\n\nLinguistics.\n Efforts would be made to have these advertised soon, with a view to\n\nhaving these positions filled by 1st August 2001.\n\n  In relation to Philosophy, it was agreed that the Campus, in\n\ncollaboration with the department, would make an approach to SEPROD to fund a\n\nlectureship or chair in Philosophy.\n\n \n\n  I submitted a plan for the building of 800 square feet of space\n\nfor the Computer-Supported Writing Centre ( CSWC) which, along with the\n\naccompanying equipment, would be part of the Language Research Centre.\n The total sum for the CSWC is estimated in the plan at\n\n$3,910,000. \n\n  In addition, I had discussed with you the need for a Linguistics\n\nLaboratory as well, to form part of the Language Research Centre.\n I proposed to you the prospect of building 300 square feet of space\n\nadjoining the CSWC and equipping it to create the beginnings of a Linguistics\n\nLaboratory.\n The Capital Expenditure on the Linguistics Laboratory would come up\n\nto Ja$2,170,000, is broken down as below.\n\n \n\n  Building Construction ( 300 sq. ft. @\n\n$4,000/sq. ft.)<space> 1,200,000\n\n

Mervyn\n\ngave me the go-ahead to place the order and has sent out a request for\n\npayment ( <space> to whom or to what entity I'm still not sure).\n\n  At present, we have in stock 380 of the reading booklets and 200\n\nof the writing ones.\n I haven't been able to explain why there aren't equal numbers of both\n\n( since they're sold as a pair) and this perhaps speaks to the need for\n\ntighter security in the storage area.\n\n  The number I have ordered allows us to start this year with 900\n\ncopies of each booklet ( old and new stock).\n I used a projected intake of 450 students for the two years 96/97 and\n\n97/98.\n The new booklets work out at\n\n$260.00 for the pair, and so if we charge\n\n$250.00 per pair \x13 including for the old stock, priced at\n\n$150.00 last year \x13 we'll make a profit of\n\n$22,500.00, more than enough to cover the cost of other printed matter given\n\nto students.\n ( See calculations below).\n I think it's best to use the old booklets in this way to defray the\n\ncosts of the new ones yet still realize some savings.\n\n \n\n \n\n  Last year's price =\n\n$150.00 per pair\n\n \n\n  Total value =\n\n$43,500 (\n\n$150.00 x

the\n\nfollowing information:\n\n  As I explained, the plan this time is to combine the two\n\nbooklets into on; this should yield  approximately 90 pages (\n\nback & front).\n\n\nFriday, July 16,

fore\n\nregarding the proposed relocation of the Mona Commons Squatter Community, we\n\nare seeking your support in requesting that the University Council \n\nrescind the F&GPC decision of October 30, 2000 and set up a sub-committee to\n\nexplain to the Government of Jamaica why the University is unable to accede\n\nto its request.\n\n  Should the Council be unwilling to take such a position, we are\n\nrequesting that at the very least the Council place on hold the October 30,\n\nF&GPC decision and designate a sub-committee to enter into dialogue with the\n\nJamaican Government with a view to resolving the problems of the Mona Commons\n\nSettlement, without implementing the proposed Housing Scheme for UWI lands,\n\nand that discussions also be held with the Sir John Golding rehabilitation\n\nCentre with a view to addressing their concerns without recourse to further\n\naction.\n\n  Please find attached a statement that outlines the basis for our\n\nreservations.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  On October 13, 2000 the University F& GPC ( min. 82 and 86) gave\n\nits approval to the Jamaican Government's proposal to relocate the Mona\n\nCommons squatter settlement to 3.2 acres of University lands adjacent to the\n\nMona Rehabilitation Centre and the site where the University laundry is\n\nlocated.\n\n  The members of WIGUT are requesting that this decision be\n\nreviewed and revoked based on the following:\n\n  The UWI holds lands in trust for the people of the\n\nCaribbean in keeping with the aims of the Charter ( 1998, Volume I):\n\n  To act as trustees or managers of any\n\nproperty, legacy, endowment, bequest or gift  for purposes of education\n\nor research or otherwise in the furtherance of the work and welfare of the\n\nUniversity</italics> &dotted- line;\n\n  We are firmly of the view that no more UWI land should be taken\n\nover for any but educational purposes.\n What seems to be a great deal of land today will appear like nothing\n\nin 50 years time.\n This in light of the fact that nearly every permanent structure\n\nbetween Matilda's Corner and August Town, the area that encompasses the Mona\n\ncampus, has been erected in the last 55 years.\n\n  The project is unsuitable for the relocation of the\n\ncommunity given its design and the nature of the family structure of the\n\naverage Mona Commons household.\n In addition there is strong evidence that the persons for whom it is\n\nsupposed to be designed consider the proposed housing units unsuitable.\n It would not be long before the three-storied one bedroom and studio\n\napartments become nothing more than an over crowded high-rise slum as has\n\nhappened with a number of others in Kingston.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Neither the proposed housing scheme, nor the UWI lands\n\nidentified to accommodate it, can house the entire community of Mona Commons.\n In the past, there have been moves to resettle the community.\n These however have only served to relocate a part of the community\n\nthus leaving the remainder to regenerate itself.\n There is nothing to suggest the entire community will be moved at\n\nthis time, in which case nothing will be gained from the move.\n\n  The realities of Jamaican politics are such that\n\ngovernment housing has been used to develop a plethora of garrison\n\ncommunities.\n These have become havens for high levels of crime and electoral\n\nmanipulation that have impacted negatively on neighboring communities.\n A professional analysis of the nature of the Mona Commons community\n\nclearly shows the symptoms of a garrison in formation.\n What the UWI has done in effect is agree to have built on its own\n\nlands a scheme that shows all the signs of becoming an institutionalized\n\ngarrison.\n\n  In bringing together some of the most promising young\n\npeople of the Caribbean at Mona we believe that the Council should have\n\nforemost in its mind their security.\n Already this issue has been a major concern at Mona.\n While recognizing that it is impossible to insulate the Campus from\n\ndevelopments taking place in the wider community, we cannot accept a\n\ndecision, in the community's best interest, that is likely to undermine the\n\nsecurity of our brightest sons and daughters or place them in an environment\n\nin which they would be adversely affected.\n\n  The decision taken by the University F&GPC is an unfortunate one.\n It seems to have been done without sufficient time for professional\n\nreflection on all the ramifications.\n We are therefore calling on the University Council to rescind the\n\ndecision.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  RADIO JAMAICA LIMITED BONUS\n\nISSUE\n\n  In accordance with a

{'text': "\x18Housing Scam?', May 30.\n From all indications, many Jamaicans are being taken for a ride and\n\nwill lose a lot of money.\n Please follow up this story since no other media has picked it up.\n\n\n  Your story was investigated and well written.\n I cannot say the same about some of your columnists who seem to be\n\nsuffering from paranoia when addressing issues concerning the JLP.\n One such person writing recently in your paper May 30, made up such a\n\nfabricated tale of foolishness about the party leadership and I was amazed\n\nthat editorial sanction was not applied.\n There is so much to write about in Jamaica at this time and I cannot\n\nunderstand how any responsible writer can waste valuable newspaper space to\n\nwrite such a story without an iota of truth.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nat the Jamaica  at the Jamaica Conference Centre.\n The Hon. Denis Lalor ruffled a lot of feathers when he suggested the\n\nresponsibility for education should be removed from the Government.\ntion\n\nhad approached a Minister of Government to be allowed to purchase a\n\nschool.\n\n  \x1cEducation will only be available\n\nto certain classes of persons\x1d;  \x1cindividuals want Jamaica to\n\ngo back to the bad old days\x1d;  \x1cwhy would the society allow a\n\nfew wealthy individuals to dictate what<space> should be taught<space> to our\n\nchildren?\x1d; cries of  \x1ccolonialism\x1d and so on.\n\n  Maybe Lalor's comments should be made public; maybe we could\n\npersuade Lalor to write an article for your publication outlining his ideas\n\nand the thinking behind them.\n\n\norour citizens to start talking about education, where it is\n\nat, and where it is not going.\n\n  I am amazed that Jamaica could be at the stage where the majority\n\nof our society appears to take very little interest in education.\n It is even more amazing that this is so at a time when the rest of\n\nthe world has renewed interest in the role of education as a catalyst for\n\ngrowth and development.\n\n  Having taught in a tertiary educational institution for several\n\nyears, I recall cases when I attempted to motivate stu<l>dents who were not\n\ndoing well academically.\n Many times I was told that the most educated in our society did not\n\nbecome rich or even earn enough to live com<l>fortably.\n\n  I also recall being told by a young teacher who was seeking\n\nhousing accommodation, that she was told by a house owner that \n\n\x1cteachers can't pay my rent\x1d.\n In general, teachers are neither respected nor appreciated, although\n\nsometimes there is lip service.\n\n  Is it any wonder that ambitious persons who want to succeed\n\nrefuse to enter the classroom?\n It is inevitable that what the society will really experience is the\n\nsitu<l>ation where  \x1cthose who can't, teach\x1d.\nisfied with this situation is in serious\n\ntrouble.\n\n  No amount of political bashing will change the present situation\n\nin Jamaica.\n Neither political party will make any difference.\n \x1ctwo term\n\nsyndrome\x1d for each political party, and the quality of our political\n\nrepre<l>sentation will continue to deteriorate until we gain the same type of\n\nreputation as some Latin American and African countries.\n Democracy will disappear and the gun will determine who will wield\n\npolitical and eco<l>nomic power in our land.\n\n  The Jamaican society needs to be awakened to the knowledge that\n\nan uneducated or undereducated and untrained work force can only be dependent\n\nand eco<l>nomically backward.\nzens will be demoralised,\n\ndemotivated and angry.\n They will continue to target those in the society who appear to be\n\n \x1cbetter off\x1d.\n\n  While I did not agree with all that Lalor said at that\n\nconference, I think that it was stimulating.\nvidual or group that puts forward new ideas that encourage\n\ndialogue and any individual who is willing to try something new should\n\nreceive support and assistance.\n\n  Jamaica's way forward is through an educated / trained work\n\nforce.\n Education must become the focal point for growth and development in\n\nour society.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  I was not comfortably out of the exams room before I was\n\nconfronted by a young lady as to my purposes on this earth.\n She was curious as to the time when I would have a baby or if my case\n\nwas one wherein I was a  \x18mule'.\n It was obvious to this woman that I am a prospective final year\n\nstudent in college and that I am not married.\n\n  Most young women who have the chance to pursue a career are\n\nreluctant.\n Some of them believe that if they have a very good figure, or can do\n\nhouse chores well, this is the passport to<space> a good life.\n I have discovered however, that men of today do not merely want a\n\nwoman, who cannot share in the financial respon<l>sibilities at home.\n\n  A young lady explained to me in an interview, the problems she\n\nhad after she became pregnant for a guy she was dating for almost two years.\n\n\n  \x18having a\n\ngood figure' without having any qualification.\n It is quite clear that the price one has to pay to provide a child\n\nwith the basic necessities of life, has escalated, and is above most average\n\nJamaican  income.\n\n fits\n\neven  <- > thoughtthough they are not working and sometimes\n\nhave two or three children.\n I find it amazing how they can try to emulate ladies who are in jobs\n\nthat pay them well and who budget their weekly or monthly salaries.\n\n\n\x18mothers' and  \x18fathers' of their siblings.\n It is most hurtful when young children are seen on the street sides\n\nwith their baskets when they should be in school.\n Every child should give some assistance to their parents, but they\n\nshould not be  \x18robbed' of their childhood days.\n\n  With the new price increases in basic items and baby food, I hope\n\nmothers will reconsider the position they are about to take when they are\n\ngoing to have their babies, and the chance they owe to these children.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n  Not considered for\n\nappointment\n\n \n\n  If Mr. Tom Tavares-Finson had read and properly understood the\n\nPrime Minister's letter to the Leader of the Opposition, proposing the\n\nappointment of the Hon. R. Carl Rattray, Q.C. as President of the Court of\n\nAppeal, he could never have made the claim, as he has, that the Prime\n\nMinister was guilty of  \x1cgrave and misleading deception\x1d by\n\ndrawing an analogy between the post of President of the Court of Appeal and\n\nthat of the Lord Chancellor.\n\n  The point being made quite clearly and correctly was that in the\n\nUnited Kingdom ( UK) from which we take our jurisprudence and most of our\n\njudicial traditions, previous political involvement does not debar a person\n\nfrom being appoint<l>ed to high judicial.\n\n  The highest judicial office in the UK is that of the Lord\n\nChancellor.\n He performs not only judicial but administrative functions and he is\n\na Cabinet Minister and Speaker of The House of Lords.\n\n  The statistics as to how often a particular Lord Chancellor sits\n\nas Judge are irrelevant since he has a right to sit and determines how often\n\nhe does so.\n\n  Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice of England, in\n\nthe Dimbleby Lecture delivered on the November 29, 1992 stated on the matter\n\nof selection of Judges -  \x1cultimately the Lord Chancellor is the Judge\n\nmaker.\n He appoints the Circuit Judges and Stipendiary Magistrates; also the\n\nAssistant Recorders and Recorders who are practising lawyers appointed to sit\n\npart-time as Judges in less serious cases.\n The higher judiciary is appointed upon the Lord Chancellor's\n\nrecommendation.\x1d\n\n  In relation to the independence of the judiciary, he also stated\n\n \x1cOf course the independence of the judi<l>ciary is a vital principle.\nence, their\n\nimpartiality and therefore the justice of their decision may be at risk.\n\n We tend to forget that the independence of judges rests not so much\n\nupon how a judge is appoint<l>ed but rather as to how secure a judge is in\n\nterms of protection from dismissal.\n\n  The appointment of persons who have held political office to be\n\nJudges has been exampled in the UK by the cases of Sir Reginald\n\nManningham-Buller, later Lord Dilhorn; Lord Hailsham ( Quinton Hogg) and most\n\nrecently Lord Havers ( Sir Michael Havers), all of whom were appointed to\n\nhigh judi<l>cial office from being Attorneys General.\n\n  In other parts of the Commonwealth, Sir Garfield Barwick was\n\nappointed Chief Justice of Australia from having been Minister of Foreign\n\nAffairs; and Nigel Bowen and Lionel Murphy were appointed to the High Court\n\nof Australia, in each case directly from having been Attorneys General.\n\n  In Canada, the Hon. Roy McMurtry who was Attorney General and\n\nwent on to become Canadian High Commissioner in London, a political\n\nappointment, moved from that post to be appoint<l>ed a Deputy Chief Justice\n\nof the Province of Ontario.\n\n  In the other great common law jurisdiction the United States of\n\nAmerica, Governor Earl Warren of California moved directly from that position\n\nto be the eminent Chief Justice of perhaps the greatest Supreme Court in that\n\ncountry's his<l>tory \x13 The Warren Court.\n\n  In Jamaica, the Hon. Leacroft Robinson, Q.C. as Attorney General\n\nwas appointed President of the Court of Appeal with the same objections now\n\nbeing taken and from the same originating source, that he was a practising\n\npolitician.\n He served in that office with great distinction.\n\n\n  The published criteria of the Lord Chancellor on the merits of\n\ncandidates for judicial office as cited by Lord Taylor of Gosforth are\n\nrelevant in this contrived contro<l>versy.\n \x18to appoint to each judicial post the\n\ncandidate who appears to him best qualified to fill it, regardless of sex,\n\nethnic origin, political affiliation or religion'\x1d.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Now that the General Election is over we must pick up the pieces\n\nand start the national building pro<l>cess.\n We still have the problems of crime and violence to overcome, thus I\n\nam making the following suggestions in this national effort.\n\n  First, we should cease to refer to areas such as Rema, Moscow,\n\nLizard Town, etc., as ghetto and garrison constituencies.\n\n ber of\n\nsoldiers, as policemen, is rec<l>ommended, since policemen are considered as\n\ncommunity peace officers.\n We must also reduce the numbers of guns in the possession of the\n\nelected representatives and appointed officers of Government.\n\n zenship, we should endeavour to\n\nreduce unemployment and promote employment for every Jamaican who wants to\n\nwork.\n by giving\n\nfull support to the massive  \x1chouse building\x1d start<l>ed by\n\nPrime Minister P.J. Patterson.\n\n  We are in need of a cement factory and a steel fabricating plant\n\nin western Jamaica.\n These factories could be built in Savanna-la-mar, Hanover, or St.\n\nJames where there is a large supply of limestone, clay, silicon and  sand.\nduce\n\nsand and gravel as these can no longer be mined in Jamaica.\n\n  Our cities and towns need immediate upgrading; Kingston, Spanish\n\nTown, Montego Bay and Savanna-la-mar.\n Savanna-la-mar should be relocated about ten ( 10) miles from its\n\npresent site.\n It is at the most unfortunate spot as it is below sea level and\n\nthus, it has always been affected by malaria, cholera etc.\n Presently, Savanna-la-mar is the most unhealthy town in the area.\n It needs a proper sewage disposal system, a project which can be\n\nfinanced through loans and collection of taxes.\n This proposal to remove Savanna-la- mar has been made by the old\n\nlegislative of Jamaica, years ago.\n\n  There are many available buildings in Kingston and lower St.\n\nAndrew which can be remodelled to reduce the severe housing short<l>age.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '8d2d770a-54a7-40e2-800a-0acdb3f3724c', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.306156+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9773045778274536, 'non_english_score': 0.022695422172546387}

to\n\nindulge in something personal, for clarity.\n\n  My stand in writing and preaching has led, in four instances, to\n\nmy being classified as a  \x1cLabourite\x1d in a PNP church; in the\n\nsecond instance, the charge was made in reverse: a PNP minister in a \n\n\x1cLabourite\x1d Church; on the other two occasions, I was referred to as\n\n \x1cthat Communist up there\x1d.\n Surely, there is some confusion created here, not by what is said, or\n\nwho said it, but by the interpretation made and its attachment to\n\nperson<l>ality.\n We do not seem to be able to separate issues from

buildings are going to pieces while\n\nmillions have been spent in Portland to set up another plant.\n The cause, as we were made to understand then, for the removal, did\n\nnot justify the

on\n\nthe streets, cannot change hearts.\n The clergy who at Polling Stations, signed ballot papers under\n\nduress, are no better than those who stuffed boxes.\n Those members of the clergy have not

the tribalism in this land and show the government\n\nhow to serve all of the people and share the national cake among us all.\n Therefore, I think the Opposition may be doing the right thing

will\n\neventually explode and shatter the dreams of tens of millions of senior\n\ncitizens the world over.\n There's one way out, and in a moment, I'll tell you how to protect\n\nyourself from the coming collapse of social security systems.\n\n  But first, let us look at the frightening scope of this problem.\n Ill effects of the sick and dying social security systems will be\n\nfelt as early as the latter part of this decade, but the dooms-day bomb is\n\ncoming for sure by the year 2011.\n That's the year the first wave of the 200 million strong, post-war\n\nbaby boom generation will turn 65 and expect to collect the retirement\n\nbenefits they honestly deserve.\n Unfortunately, the money won't be there for them.\n\n\n  When a few thousand people share an opinion or buy a product, it\n\namounts to a curiosity or perhaps the beginning of a trend.\n But when 200 million do so all over the world, it's a revolution.\n And this revolution will shake Western civilization to its\n\nfounda<l>tions.\n War between the generations is inevitable, with the key issue being\n\nwho will benefit, and who will pay.\n\n  If you were born between 1946 and 1964, chances are, you are a\n\nmember of a doomed generation.\n You won't get much from Social Security or other government\n\nretirement plans \x13 possibly not even 10 per cent of your contri<l>butions.\n In effect, what you have already paid in \x13 and will continue to pay \x13\n\nis nothing more than an income tax.\n And, even if you are now in your 50's and 60's, you'll likely see\n\nyour benefits reduced, as the over-burdened social security system begins to\n\ncollapse for lack of underlying support.\n\n \n\n  Three inescapable trends will be responsible for the fall.\n The first of these is the aging of the baby boomers.\n In North America, for example, baby boomers now comprise one-third of\n\nthe entire population.\nzens:\n\npeople just live longer today and may live even longer, in years ahead.\n The third is that today's mothers are giving birth at a rate just\n\nhalf that of their mothers, which means the rising number of seniors is not\n\noffset by a corresponding number of children.\n This is a trend that transcends language and cultural barriers\n\nthroughout the industrialized world.\n\n  The inevitable result of these trends is that 21st century\n\nworkers won't be able to pay the benefits for all those retired folks, even\n\nif they wanted to, and you can be sure they won't!\n Government retirement systems are usually based on a pay-as-you-go\n\nplan.\n\n\n  Any surplus goes into the general fund to be used accordingly.\n Contrary to what some believe, no money is held in trust.\n\n\n  There was a time when the system worked.\n And back then, nobody anticipated the social changes that would\n\ndestroy it.\n In the United States of 1940, there were more than 40 workers to\n\nsupport a single retiree.\n By 1990, it was down to just 3.4 workers for every retiree.\n And by 2011, experts say only 2 workers will support each retiree.\n\n\n  You don't have to be Einstein to see that it will not work.\n But don't expect anything from your political representative, not in\n\nthe 90's!\n\n\n  Today, baby boomers are paying record portions of their incomes\n\nto support today's retirees.\n After having made these sacrifices, they will demand similar benefits\n\nwhen they retire.\n\n\n \n\n  Forget the fight.\n If you are part of the post-war baby boom ( born between 1946 and\n\n1964), you would better plan for your retire<l>ment as if Social Security did\n\nnot exist, which for all intents and purposes, it won't, by the year 2011.\n Your only solution is: start early and build a fortune before you\n\nretire!\n\n  Plan to invest on the long term.\n Profits of 50 per cent, 100 per cent, 500 per cent, and more, will\n\ngo a long way towards building a sizeable nest egg, and are the best ways to\n\nensure a rich and rewarding retirement.\n\n  If you are currently in your 50's or early 60's and have already\n\naccumulated a nest egg, your solution is to double or triple it before you\n\nretire.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  The Constitution of Jamaica gives to the Prime Minister the\n\nright to choose the President of the Court of Appeal, and gives no power of\n\nveto to the Leader of the Opposition in that regard.\n Thus there can be no legal quarrel when the Prime Minister does what\n\nthe Constitution says he can do.\n\n est appointment has generated\n\nshould cause us to consider whether this area should not be the subject of\n\nsome reform.\n\n  Perhaps the appointment of the President of the Court of Appeal,\n\nthe Chief Justice, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General,\n\nand other constitutionally protected posts should be the sub<l>ject of Senate\n\nconfirmations. Accordingly, a Senate sub- commit<l>tee could conduct\n\nhearings, giving interested parties an opportunity to be heard before a\n\ndecision is taken.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '6e058f8e-cbea-4efb-87e0-90fe2add5faf', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.307554+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9692341685295105, 'non_english_score': 0.030765831470489502}

Carl Rattray to the post of President of the\n\nCourt of Appeal.\n\n ing Mr. Rattray's integrity or\n\nlegal knowledge, it certainly appears that his political career with the PNP\n\nover the past twenty years, renders him unable to pass impartial judgement in\n\ncases involving any members, activists, associates, etc., of either the PNP\n\nor the JLP.\n Mr. Rattray's part in the injustices levied against the Jamaican\n\npeople in the past, by PNP governments, for example:\n\n  The state of emergency and detention of several activists and\n\nmembers of the then Opposition in 1976;\n\n izen in 1992 to the U.S.A.\n\nbefore all his legal rights to appeal had been exhausted;\n\n  the recent rape of the electoral process in the March 30\n\nelections;\n\n \n\n der why after thirteen years on\n\nthe run, a known PNP activist, wanted by the Police has now chosen to hand\n\nhimself over to the law.\n Perhaps he now feels assured of a favourable judgement should he find\n\nit necessary to appeal to the highest court in the land.\n\n gant in ignoring the\n\nobjections of the Leader of the Opposition, as well as others in the society\n\nwho have raised their voices against his choice.\n Based on his actions, both in the past and now, it would not be\n\nunreasonable for people to think that Mr. Patterson sees his main task as\n\nPrime Minister as not to seek the good of all Jamaicans but as Santa Claus\n\nhanding out choice positions and favours to party faith<l>fuls \x13 chose good\n\nlittle boys and girls of the PNP for services well rendered.\n Mr. Patterson would do good to remember that he is not the Prime\n\nMinister of the PNP but of Jamaica.\n If he insists on this appointment he will be showing all Jamaicans\n\njust who is most important to him&dotted-line; and it would not be\n\nJamaica.\n\n  Mr. Rattray would do well to refuse this appointment if he wishes\n\nto save the Prime Minister from him<l>self.\n\n  Over to you Governor General Cooke \x13 are you for the PNP or are\n\nyou for Jamaica?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Attached is a letter which speaks for itself.\n dated\n\nFebruary 22, 1993 is in response to mine of the November 24, 1992.\n\n  It is now the 26th May 1993 \x13 exactly 2 months and 4 days since\n\nthat letter was written.\nously, a section of paragraph one reads inter alia\n\n \x1c---, but your com<l>plaint has just come to hand.\x1d\n May I ask what Mrs. Ramsaran means when she states that the complaint\n\nhad just come to hand?\n Where was the letter all those months?\n And why has 65 days elapsed without my receiving a reply to the\n\nletter dated 22nd February 1993?\n\n  Mrs. Ramsaran, may I point out that the matter which was brought\n\nto the attention of the Superintendent of Insurance relates specifically to\n\nmy piece of nugget \x13 my only child.\n I get extremely hot under the collar when issues relating to my child\n\nare not properly addressed.\n\n  I listened with interest to the Superintendent of Insurance who\n\nspoke at length on  \x1cTuesday Forum\x1d on the 25th inst.\n He made it quite clear that his office's main function is to protect\n\nthe interest(s) of policy holders, whether in the area of life insurance,\n\ncar, or house insurance.\nlate his words into action by\n\ncausing his subordinates to respond to my long overdue letter.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ter dated November 24, 1992.\n Kindly accept our apologies for the delay in responding but your\n\ncomplaint has just come to hand.\n\n  An investigation is presently being conducted and as soon as this\n\nis completed you will hear from us.\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  When Jesus last came on earth, there was no prophet in Israel for\n\nalmost 500 years ( God had stopped talking to them because of their\n\nunrepentant sinful life), the Romans had invaded the land in B.C. 63 after a\n\nchequered military history of Babylonian cap<l>ture B.C. 580 and Alexander\n\nThe Great establishing Greek rule in B.C. 333.\n The lesson is clear.\nfer oppression\n\nby foreign invaders.\n\n  time, not only did the Priests ( Ministers of\n\nReligion) and Pharisees ( University Lecturers)  refuse to consider Jesus a good man, but they went to\n\nthe extent of killing him.\n They also refused to consider Him Divine and to this day the Jews are\n\nstill looking for a Messiah.\n Of course, it was the Jews, principally from the countryside, that\n\nknew who He was and has caused the imple<l>mentation of the will of God,\n\nwhich is to spread the word worldwide, but first in Jerusalem.\n\n  Today, in Jamaica, the scripture is being propagated by\n\norganizations (  \x1cChurches\x1d) that are Roman, not Israeli, in\n\norigin.\nly controlled by the I.M.F. ( A branch of the\n\nUnited Nations) whose logo is that of Roman Emperors; our laws and politics\n\nare based on a Greeco-Roman model; Christian love in the population is\n\nreplaced by romantic love; we also find a preponder of peo<l>ple with demonic\n\nspirits; extensive disease and a lot of religion but little Christianity as\n\nwas in  time.\n The Roman invasion results in the control of thought and behaviour in\n\nsocializing fashion, resulting primary<l>ly in unconscious but de facto\n\nrejec<l>tion of  laws.\n\n sent day invasion of Jamaica,\n\nby Rome ( known as Babylon, in Revelation), will Jesus come again to save His\n\npeople?\n\n  Or will His people, with His word, save themselves from\n\nthemselves?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Sometimes a torturing surmise haunts me \x13 that the generation\n\nthat is over or nearing three score and ten will leave Jamaica worse than it\n\nfound her.\n Is this not a shame?\n Some of us have been blessed with the best in scholarship; some have\n\nbeen the best technicians, while oth<l>ers have been excellent\n\nbusiness<l>men, managers, etc; but have lacked the vital ingredient that\n\nbuilds and unites a strong nation \x13 being our  \x1c\n\nkeepers\x1d!\n\n  We have been deliberately torn apart by religion and politics in\n\nthe first round; the fruits thereof fol<l>lowed in abundance \x13 brother\n\nagainst brother, family against fami<l>ly, neighbour against neighbour;\n\nbecause we are unaware that every thought, word, and deed are seeds sown and\n\nreacting obediently to God's abundant law of reciprocity.\n When I see Ronnie Thwaites at this crucial time of the budget,\n\njoining the  \x1celectoral reform\x1d chorus, using words to the\n\neffect -  \x1cgovernment squandering chances to improve image\x1d (\n\n Herald of June 11 page 2), I know not who to trust in this\n\ncountry.\ners,\n\nknows that more than anything else, Jamaica needs  \x1cpeople\n\nchange\x1d.\nmendations to\n\nthe Governor General, I have the weird feeling it is an attempt at\n\nundermining the government's authority.\n\n\n als are unresponsive when\n\ncriti<l>cism or advice come from ordinary mortals; but I suggest that the\n\nsingle most important challenge to government and people is devel<l>oping\n\nlove of country \x13 patriotism; while religion's most important task is\n\nrevitalizing brotherly love.\n These will make all systems work and will achieve the new Jamaica\n\ndesired.\n In this area, the news media can make a tremendous input that will,\n\nin the long run, improve their image.\n\n  Once again, we have to realize that for every action there is a\n\nreac<l>tive maturity time; but impatience on our part makes us destroy the\n\nbud to see the flower.\n\n Apparently, those who demand immediate electoral reform, completely\n\nforget the nation's degeneracy and ignorance, elements that undermine any and\n\nevery system.\n Only fools put new wine in old bottles; to the extent that human\n\nminds are suppressed and eroded, the environment, pro<l>grammes and systems\n\nare also erod<l>ed and suppressed, in keeping with the adamantine reciprocal\n\nlaw.\n cast\n\nstones, the wise must refrain, and when  \x1cthe they who know not what\n\nthey do\x1d contin<l>ue to publicly demean leaders of government, they\n\nare adding inflammatory material to the flame of tribalism and hatred.\n\n  By now, we ought to grasp the gravity of the situation created\n\nby non-reading school leavers and what it spells for the future.\n Here is where our efforts are desperately needed, as the best plans\n\nin the hands of ignorance, are failures.\n Are there leaders in this country with vested interest in ignorance?", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a09e5788-4fab-40a5-9370-ef947d36d322', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.308924+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9731884002685547, 'non_english_score': 0.026811599731445312}

talked with the friendly locals; watched workmen\n\nbuilding quaint thatched cottages ( straight out of a painter's can<l>vas);\n\nsaw fishermen preparing their boats or bringing in their catches.\n We drove up into the hills and walked around Munro College; admired\n\n its cut-stone buildings.\n\n  We rode the giant waves that are typical of that coastline, went\n\nbeach combing, climbed trees, lazed over pink sunsets and in the evenings got\n\nto know our children a little better, who, for lack of more  exhilarating activity, were forced to\n\ncommu<l>nicate with us.\npect one of them even read a book&dotted-line;\n\ncover to cover!\n\n riences and the acute anxiety we had\n\nanticipated in the company of a ten and sixteen year-old suffering the\n\ndeprivations of sa<l>tellite dish, ghetto blaster, com<l>puter games, plazas\n\nand all the other trappings of City life never manifested itself.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  How in these hard times can the Government of Jamaica even\n\nconsider giving the mini-bus op<l>erators a fare increase when they continue\n\nto provide the commuters with such poor serv<l>ice which continue to affect\n\nus daily.\n\n\n  Before the goodly Minister even considers a fare increase, I\n\nbelieve that the following should be met by the operators.\n\n  1. The conductors should be made to attire themselves\n\nprop<l>erly.\n\n sengers\n\nwith tickets after they have tendered their fare.\n\n  3. Each operator should see to it that their bus is properly\n\nmain<l>tained which includes washing it every day and regular servicing.\n\n  4 The Government should see to it that every route has\n\nad<l>equate buses plying the routes and I would also like to call on the\n\nGovernment to remove the type of buses on the SR 1 to Downtown and Barbican\n\nRoute because these buses move very slowly, are extremely hot and are always\n\ndirty.\n\n\n \n\n  I challenge the operators to meet all the above criteria then I\n\nam sure that the public will not mind paying more for the better service.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  There is a move by the United Nations Secretariat to place the\n\nquestion of a refer<l>endum for the  secession of Eritrea on the agenda of the United\n\nNations General As<l>sembly.\n\n  The situation in Ethiopia is very explosive in relation to the\n\nother countries of the world.\nedent in his\n\nprogramme of ethnicity which he adopted from Stalin and which pro<l>vides for\n\nand allows the disin<l>tegration of Ethiopia along ethnic class and religious\n\nlines.\n\n lomon/Sheba/Haile Selassie I dynasty\n\nis the only means by which Ethiopia can hope to survive as an empire.\n We, Ras Tafari minority in Jamaica who recognize Ethiopian\n\nsov<l>ereignty under constitutional monarchy, are calling on the Transitional\n\nGovernment of Ethiopia and their allies in Africa and the United Na<l>tions\n\nto desist from trying to destroy Ethiopia with their policies and to honour\n\nthe 1953 Resolution by the Unit<l>ed Nations by which Eritrea was again\n\nfederated with the Ethiopian Empire.\n\n  They should also help to create the climate for the return and\n\nrestoration of the legitimate and constitutional monarchial Government of\n\nHaile Selassie I through his son and heirs.\n\n ing upon\n\nthe Jamaican Gov<l>ernment who is a member of the United Nations to let its\n\nvoice be heard and oppose this move by the U.N.

bauxite loading dock areas.\n\n  We at Kaiser Bauxite share the public's concern for any adverse\n\neffect which our min<l>ing and shipping operations could have on the\n\nenviron<l>ment, and appreciate Mr. Shulman's observations on co<l>ral\n\nresearch in Discovery Bay, where our port is located.\n\n tain\n\nour shiploading operations as a dust-free one, particularly because vessels\n\nused today are chartered from varying cus<l>tomers and agents and the ships\n\noriginally designed to fit our shiploading chute are no longer available.\n\n  In an effort to overcome this problem, we recently spent\n\nUS$450,000 on a new shiploading system which in<l>cludes a Telescopic Chute\n\nar<l>rangement expected to reduce and control dust escape.\n\n ternational,\n\nU.S.A., was in<l>stalled in July 1992 but does not yet meet Kaiser's\n\nstandards and requirements.\n\n  A further modification will be implemented during June 1993 in\n\nconcert with the de<l>sign engineers as we work to improve our\n\nperformance.\n\n pany is about to introduce a new\n\nmethod of treating baux<l>ite which suppresses the dust as it travels through\n\nthe system and into the ship's hold.\n\n  Experiments undertaken during the last quarter of 1992 and in\n\nJanuary 1993 indicate that dust escape can be re<l>duced 90 per cent by this\n\nmethod, and we are now await<l>ing the go-ahead from our customers once they\n\nhave com<l>pleted their own modifications to accept the treated bauxite.\n\n  We therefore believe that the combination of the two systems,\n\ninstalled at cost to date of\n\n$600,000, will reduce dusting at our pier to negli<l>gible levels over the\n\nnext few months.\n\n  Finally, Mr. Shulman, and other marine life interests will be\n\npleased to know that a Kaiser-sponsored meeting to make plans for a community\n\nbased management pro<l>gramme of marine and coastal resources in the\n\nDiscovery Bay area, will be held at the Ma<l>rine Lab on July 8.\n\n ings initiated by Kaiser since July\n\n1992, as both Kaiser and marine scientists from the U.W.I. and as far as\n\nLouisiana State University, pursue a commitment to protecting the environment\n\nas

May,\n\nOctober and December.\n\n  However, up to now in 1993 there is one word that stands out far\n\nabove all other appropriate ones in describing the weather strictly in\n\nrelation to the Moore Town-Mill Bank area.\n.\n The heaviness of the showers is unusual but hardly an eyebrow has\n\nbeen raised because of this.\nsternation is the fact that they were\n\ncontinual throughout March into April whence they merged violently into the\n\ncontin<l>uous May rains.\n Damage is great in some sections of the Rio Grande Valley.\nroons \x13 are marooned by the effects of a dam built by\n\nBritish slaves.\n\n  Much more than a year ago the signs became clear that\n\nre<l>medial measures were necessary at Dam Head ( the section of road broken\n\naway near the dam is known by this name) if some disaster were to be averted.\n But apart from a few thoughtful peasants who placed stones into the\n\ncreek as the seeping water silently set the stage for the grand assault\n\ndestined

been done was to look at these\n\n$5.00 properties and see how much increase in specific areas was justified\n\nfor owners.\n Everyone would agree that\n\n$5.00 per year is a ridiculous figure no

reported in the All England Law Reports\n\nfrom the House of Lords in 1991.\n\n  It is of interest to note further, that Lord Gardiner seldom sat\n\nas a judge while between 1971 and 1964 Lords Elwyn-Jones and Hailsham sat on\n\nonly twenty-nine of the five hundred and forty-two cases heard in the House\n\nof Lords.\n Thus, the position of Lord Chancellor is an aberration, a creature

years.\n\n  The ability for the lands south of the main road to absorb any\n\nrainfall is nil.\n They are just super saturated because of a rainfall to date of 40\n\nins. in 60 days.\ncomes run-off and all the drains and\n\nculverts ( they are not miss<l>ing) cannot handle the volume of water.\n Indeed, rain falling on say 1,200 acres at the rate of 1 inch in 1\n\nhour, becomes approx<l>imately 700,000 gallons of run-off in 1 hour.\n\n  If this person is referring to Chukka Cove and not the area by\n\nLaughlands P.O., then the water he/she is seeing, is from a gully through\n\nRichmond that has simply overflowed its banks where it crosses under the\n\nPar<l>ish Council Road ( through Rich<l>mond to Lewis) and the excess water\n\ncomes down that road into the main road.\n\n  For this person's information, this private land owner (\n\nRich<l>mond Farms Limited) is not blocking anything.\nverts, gullies, etc. and\n\ncutting the main road and council road banks for the past fifteen

recent staging of the National Inter-Secondary Schools Debate\n\ncompetition at the Education Development and Demonstration Centre ( EDDC)\n\nCaenwood Centre, was quite an experience for all participants.\n Just sitting there and listening to those students, from the\n\ndifferent schools across the island, delivering themselves with confidence\n\nand pride was indeed a plus for lovers of good public pre<l>sentation.\n\n \n\nBoys' proudly wore the victory laurel and collected the coveted prizes.\n Here was a fine display of effective team work where the three\n\nmem<l>bers of the Wolmer's team ( Brain Moodie, Jermaine Spence and Stuart\n\nSimpson) made superb presentations.\n However, their opponent May Pen High school was a force to be\n\nreckoned with especially with the unique presentation of second speaker\n\nSamantha Gooden, who had the audience spellbound most of the time.\n\n  Credit must be given to the organizers of this competition whose\n\nvision of youth partici<l>pation at the secondary level is helping to\n\npositively develop young minds for the benefit of the country.\n We appreciate the excellent work done by Project Co-ordinator, Miss\n\nNorma Ro<l>chester, Mr. Gerry McDaniel for staging workshops in pre<l>paring\n\nstudents for the debate; and of course for all the teach<l>ers who worked\n\nassiduously with their respective team.\n\n  The sponsors Burger King, Desnoes & Geddes, R.J.R and Esso all\n\ncontributed greatly toward making the debate a reality.\n It is also good to see that J.B.C. television has been showing the\n\ndebate regularly and will continue to do so during the summer holidays.\n\n  For the other schools that have actively participated in such\n\n \x1chealthy competition\x1d, please bear in mind that defeat with\n\nhonour is merely victory delayed.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  As the gunmen successfully take over the country and we duck for\n\ncover and pray that the next bullet won't catch us, the well-protected\n\nMinisters do abso<l>lutely nothing to help us to de<l>fend ourselves.\n\n  The price of a gun is beyond our reach, the length of time it\n\ntakes to process a licence is ridic<l>ulous, the fee of\n\n$500 which was upped from\n\n$50 is a sick joke that shows just how much they put us first.\n\n ica, people are permitted to buy a\n\nweapon to defend themselves even though their police force is well-manned,\n\nwell trained, well funded and well equipped.\n\n bery ( per capita) is above that of\n\nthe United States and our police force is crippled by the lack of finance,\n\nman-power, equipment and resources.\n Yet our well armed, well protected politicians insist that the way to\n\nsolve crime is not to allow us, the innocent victims to arm ourselves against\n\nthe monsters that stalk us.\n\n  Please understand, I am not advocating a vigilante force, I am\n\nsimply saying that if I am attacked and I can shoot back, I cannot only\n\nprotect my life, but I may shoot a wanted person that the police have not\n\nbeen able to catch.\n\n  The Neighbourhood Watch is a joke to the well-armed thug who\n\nknows that most of us can<l>not really defend

{'text': "Language as an expression of identity in Dominica\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  This paper takes as its starting point the languages Dominicans\n\nconsider themselves to speak, although it is recognized that these represent\n\nstereotypes to which actual usage does not necessarily conform.\n Indeed, Le Page ( Le Page and Tabouret-Keller 1985: 9) has pointed\n\nout, with much justification, that the problem of defining a language is\n\nespecially real in the linguistically heterogeneous societies characteristic\n\nof much of the Caribbean.\n Even in societies like these, however, speakers have some concept of\n\ntheir language.\n Such concepts have their uses.\n They represent one means by which speakers identify themselves and are\n\nidentified by others, and they also provide a standard against which actual\n\nusage can be judged.\n It will be shown here that even where their linguistic behavior\n\ndiverges from the stereotypes, Dominican speakers are still using language to\n\nexpress their identities as members of Dominican society. \n\n  Consideration of contact situations has tended to focus on the\n\ntraditionally recognized languages seen to be involved.\n These represent, historically, not just different linguistic\n\nstructures, but also different cultures.\n Even from this standpoint, however, the fact is brought out that what\n\nare involved are never really separate systems, since the speech of mono <l>\n\nlinguals in the relevant communities has, regardless of which of the\n\nlanguages they claim to speak, features in common which are not shared with\n\nmonolingual speakers of these languages in noncontact situations ( see, for\n\nexample Weinreich 1953).\n In extreme cases, what has been labeled code switching, defined by\n\nGumperz and Cook- Gumperz ( 1976: 8) as reliance on  'the meaningful\n\njuxtaposition of what speakers must process as strings formed according to\n\nthe internal syntactic rules of two distinct systems&'  , has become\n\nthe norm for informal exchanges between bilingual speakers of comparable\n\nsocial backgrounds.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  Traditionally, two languages have been identified as spoken in\n\nDominica: a lexically French Creole ( Patois) and English.\n Patois is the more highly focused.\n Its grammatical structure has been the subject of a number of\n\ndescriptions, notably by Taylor ( for example, 1977).\n Although even from these descriptions it is evident that the\n\ninevitable variation occurs, identification of Patois as a distinct\n\nvariety is relatively unproblematic.\n For one thing, its lexis, being mainly derived from French, sets it\n\napart, at least in theory, from the other varieties in use.\n What passes for English in Dominica is relatively heterogeneous,\n\nthough less so, on the whole, than lexically English varieties spoken in some\n\nparts of the Caribbean, for example in Jamaica.\n The varieties all share with Patois features that are foreign to\n\ngenerally accepted Standard English.\n They are nearly all labelled English by Dominicans.\n The one exception is a variety known to its speakers as Cockoy, which\n\nappears to be confined to the villages of Marigot and Wesley in the northeast\n\nof Dominica.\n Cockoy shares some of the Creole features of other Dominican\n\nvarieties, but it is characterized by the presence of other Caribbean islands\n\nsuch as Antigua.\n Speakers of Cockoy all appear to control some other lexically English\n\nvariety spoken in Dominica.\n These other varieties will all be referred to as DEC ( Dominican\n\nEnglish Creole) in this paper. \n\n  Some understanding of the contexts out of which the concept of\n\neach language developed in Dominica is necessary to account for the current\n\nrelationship between language and identity, since choices and their impli <l>\n\ncations derive, to a large extent, from historical facts. \n\n  Patois was first brought to Dominica in the seventeenth or\n\neighteenth century by slaves who arrived there with French settlers from\n\nMartinique and Guadeloupe, where French colonies had been established in\n\n1635.\n Dominica is sandwiched between these islands, 25 miles south of Guade\n\n<l> loupe and 30 miles north of Martinique.\n These early French settlers were mainly woodcutters who later became\n\nsmall farmers, cultivating mainly tobacco and cotton.\n Coffee was introduced early in the eighteenth century, and it soon\n\nbecame the most important crop, earning much wealth for the growers.\n Though denied political power after the coming of the British in\n\n1763, the French planters remained numerically and economically strong until\n\nwell into the nineteenth century, and even then, many of the estates were\n\ntaken over by mulattos from Martinique and Guadeloupe ( Honeychurch 1984:\n\n77). \n\n  After the British assumed control, some of the slaves belonging\n\nto the French ran away and formed Maroon settlements in the mountains, where\n\nthey were soon joined by newly arrived slaves, among others.\n These settlements became Patois-speaking enclaves.\n At the same time, on the plantations, those slaves who had stayed\n\nremained openly loyal to their French owners.\n 'Frenchness'\n\n . \n\n  Patois is the language acquired by the majority of Dominicans,\n\napproximately 97 percent of whom are of African descent.\n The only significant ethnic minority is made up of descendants of the\n\nCaribs who controlled the island before the coming of the Europeans.\n Over the centuries, the Caribs gradually abandoned their language for\n\nPatois.\n Linguistically they are no longer distinguishable as a group.\n Their ethnic separateness, too, is threatened, since the majority of\n\nthose so labeled are of mixed ancestry. \n\n  Patois remains structurally close to the vernaculars of the\n\nneighbouring French islands and St. Lucia.\n Despite differences, many of which relate to the fact that Patois\n\ncoexists with English, whereas French is the official language of Martinique\n\nand Guadeloupe, language provides a bond between all these islands.\n 'Anglophone'\n\n , it is slightly further away than the French islands with which\n\nDominica has the most direct air links, for example. \n\n  Patois is the traditional vehicle for oral literature, that is,\n\nfor the   kont   or folktales told at wakes for\n\nthe dead, for folksongs, and for proverbs.\n A link between Patois and national culture has long been recognized\n\nby many Dominicans.\n This recognition arose out of the nostalgia for a romanticized French\n\npast which Patois evoked.\n More recently it has become part of the new national consciousness\n\nand has been officially encouraged more and more in recent years.\n Prizes have been offered for some time to the best tellers of\n\n  kont   .\n During the annual independence celebrations, a special day is set\n\naside on which everyone is urged to use only Patois.\n There are now radio programs in Patois, and the occasional\n\nadvertisement may also be heard on the radio.\n During the early 1980s, an independent orthography for Antillean\n\nCreole, that is, the vernaculars of Martinique, Guadeloupe, St. Lucia, and\n\nDominica, was agreed to at a workshop held in St. Lucia, but this has not yet\n\nbeen put to much use.\n has also been set up as part of the\n\nCultural Division of the Ministry of Community, Housing and Social Affairs.\n Last but not least, Dominica's motto, adopted even before its\n\npolitical independence in 1978,   Apr &egrave; s Bondi é\n\nC'est la Ter   ,  'After God, it's the Land'  ,\n\nis in Patois. \n\n  English was introduced as the official language in 1763.\n However, in addition to what has been seen as a language barrier\n\ncreated by Patois, difficulty in getting from place to place in this, the\n\nmost mountainous island in the Lesser Antilles, hampered its spread.\n As late as 1946, census figures indicated that 25 percent of the\n\npopulation did not speak English.\n The percentage must now be significantly smaller, but more recent\n\nfigures are not available.\n Many young people nowadays acquire some variety of DEC as a first\n\nlanguage. \n\n  As the language of the colonial rulers and their administration,\n\nas well as the only accepted written medium, English has been regarded as the\n\nlanguage of the elite.\n This prestige is shared by all lexically English varieties, with the\n\nexception of Cockoy.\n English is seen as the key to upward social mobility.\n Parents not only actively encourage their children to speak it, but\n\nthey make a special point of addressing the younger ones in their version of\n\nEnglish, even if they customarily use Patois to each other and to other\n\nadults.\n Ability to speak English is not only seen as a sign that the user is\n\neducated; it is also taken as a mark of sophistication.\n These correlations are becoming less and less valid, but the\n\nstereotypes persist. \n\n  The origin of Cockoy can be traced to slaves of British planters\n\nwho moved to Dominica from the Leeward Islands shortly after the British\n\nassumed control.\n Most of them settled in the parish of St. Andrew ( then La Soye), in\n\nwhich the villages of Marigot and Wesley are situated.\n New ties have been formed over the years.\n Dominica was administered along with Antigua, Montserrat, and St.\n\nKitts-Nevis in the Leeward Islands Federation from 1871 to 1939. More\n\nrecently, during the 1960s when the airport at Melville Hall, also in the\n\nparish of St. Andrew, was being built, workers were recruited from these\n\nother islands.\n There is also a link through the Methodist Church, which is strong in\n\nthe Leewards and also in the Marigot-Wesley area, whereas the majority of\n\nDominicans are Roman Catholic. \n\n  Cockoy is rarely heard outside the home nowadays.\n Many of those who do not speak it hold it up to ridicule, an attitude\n\nwhich is sometimes transferred to all Dominicans who are known to have been\n\nborn in the areas with which the variety is associated.\n\n\ntelliing   telling   jokes, for gossiping, or for exchanging\n\ncurses.\n Like Patois, too, it is a vehicle for folklore.\n The folktales, whether narrated in Patois or in Cockoy, share the\n\nAfrican heritage of most Dominicans. \n\n  Alongside the negative attitudes to Cockoy, it must be noted\n\nthat, despite current efforts to promote Patois as the vehicle of national\n\nculture, those Dominicans who regularly use Patois rather than English in\n\ntheir daily intercourse through lack of proficiency in English are looked\n\nupon by the population as a whole as uneducated and/or countrified.\n This negative view of Patois speakers is being reinforced by the fact\n\nthat some variety of Dominican English is now the first language of a growing\n\nnumber of young Dominicans.\n It is clear to the outsider, however, that linguistic features\n\nassociated with Patois occur more or less frequently in the speech of all\n\nDominicans. \n\n \n\n  Of the linguistic features which are shared by all or most\n\nvarieties of Dominican speech, the most obvious are lexical items such as\n\n  v &egrave; p    'something received\n\nfor nothing, usually a ride in a motor vehicle'  , adverbs such as\n\n  afos    'to such an extent'  ,\n\nexclamations like   Bondj é   ! \n\n'good heavens!'  , the emphatic tags   wi \n\n and   non   , <fnr>  1  <fnr>\n\nall from Patois, and other words like  teacher, station, so, because\n\n , which were once specifically associated with speakers of English.\n\n\n 1. The orthography used to represent Patois in this paper is the one\n\nagreed on in 1982 for Antillean Creole.\n\n Present-day Dominicans are not generally conscious of the origin of\n\nsuch words at the time when they are using them.\n Their use by speakers of all the usually identified linguistic\n\nbackgrounds is evidence of the oneness of Dominicans on some levels. \n\n  Most varieties of Dominican speech also have certain phonological\n\nfeatures in common.\n For example, many speakers have only tense high vowel phonemes,\n\nwhatever variety they are using.\n There is also a shared tendency for the main stress to fall toward\n\nthe end of each word-group.\n Uninflected nouns and verbs represent the most striking\n\nmorphosyntactic features common to the different varieties  .  Such\n\nusage is very inconsistent in DEC, but it is regular in Patois and Cockoy.\n\n\n\n \n\n  The following excerpts from recorded interviews are used here to\n\nillustrate some of the points made so far in this paper.\n Their selection was designed to give representation to each of the\n\nlinguistic varieties recognized by Dominicans.\n The sample is necessarily limited.\n DEC, especially, is underrepresented, but differences within it\n\nhave been deliberately ignored for the purpose of this discussion.\n Of the three speakers whose usage is illustrated here, the first one\n\nclaimed to speak no English, the second to speak both English and Patois, and\n\nthe third to speak English and Cockoy.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd6a99456-b7bc-4b68-b904-b359676b82a3', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.319962+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9723126888275146, 'non_english_score': 0.02768731117248535}
{'text': "Derek Walcott, The Nobel Laureate for Literature, 1992, was born,\n\nalong with his twin brother Roderick, on January 23, 1930, in St Lucia in the\n\nold British West Indies.\n His parents were Alix Walcott, a respected school teacher, and her\n\nhusband Warwick Walcott, of the Public Works Department.\n Warwick died when the twins were one year old, leaving Alix the\n\ndaunting task of bringing up the twins and their sister Pamela.\n Despite the early death of Warwick he, who had been himself a painter\n\nand producer of plays, was to have a great influence on the artistic career\n\nof Derek. \n\n \n\nCaribbean Voices  I was fortunate to come into contact with Walcott's\n\nwork as early as 1949, and I first met him in 1951 at the Colony Club,\n\nJamaica.\n He was with an old school mate of mine, Tony Steer, who, Walcott tells\n\nme, later appointed himself a bishop of his own church somewhere in Central\n\nAmerica. \n\n  Walcott was then an undergraduate at the University College of the\n\nWest Indies, Mona.\n He was reading ( or as we would have said in those days of colonial\n\ninnocence, studying) the old combined honours degree: English, French, Latin.\n I was still a lecturer at the London University Institute of\n\nEducation, and had returned to Jamaica, where I had been born in 1920, partly\n\nto look at the new University College.\n Later, in 1953, when I joined UCWI, as one of the few West Indian\n\nmembers of staff, Walcott was still a student. \n\n  I can remember Derek's smile when, on that first meeting with\n\nSteer, I quoted the first of his verses which stuck in my mind:  ...nursing\n\nneurosis like a potted plant... \n He did not smile easily in the early days at UCWI, and alas,\n\nsometimes gave the impression that he was in fact nursing neurosis. \n\n  My recollection is that I had heard vaguely of Walcott in 1946\n\nfrom James ( Sonny) Rodway on the crowded SS Jamaica Producer which was\n\ntaking a whole batch of us, from the Caribbean, to pursue university \x13 mainly\n\npostgraduate \x13 studies all over the U.K.\n Rodway was from a distinguished Guyanese family but he had moved\n\nto St Lucia in the colonial education service to be an inspector of schools.\n One of Walcott's earliest works is dedicated to him \x13 because, says\n\nthe inscription quoting Catullus,\n -\n\n  ...namque tu solebas/ Meas esse aliquid putare nugas... \n\n \n\n  Much to my surprise Rodway knew the work of George Campbell of\n\nJamaica, whom he then \x13 1946 \x13 considered to be the leading Caribbean poet.\n ( This came out as we were discussing some poems I had recently\n\npublished.)\n I was surprised because at the time I hardly knew of St Lucia ( its\n\ncapital, Castries, had been raided during the war and heavily shelled); I\n\ncertainly did not know of its poets.\n And although George was the leading nationalist poet of Jamaica, and\n\na protégé of Edna and Norman Manley, I might not have known\n\nmuch about his work except for the fact that we had been students together at\n\nthe Jesuit High School, St George's College in Kingston.\n George's work was also well known to another St Lucian, the painter\n\nand amateur anthropologist, Harry Simmons.\n And through Harry, Walcott was more influenced by Campbell's work\n\nthan he perhaps realised.\n where Simmons\n\nreads to Walcott Campbell's well known poem  Holy  :  'Holy\n\nbe the white head of a Negro...'  and where in fact Walcott so took\n\nover the theme of  'Holy be...'  that the subtitle of my\n\nforthcoming book on his poetry is  'from exorcism to benediction'\n\n .\n For his concerns moved from those of cursing the vile things of his\n\nearly experience to that of blessing the good things.\n\n\nAnother Life  . \n\n  One of the other bits of his verse which I could have quoted at\n\nhim in the Colony Club was  'You in the castle of your skin/ I the\n\nswineherd...' \n The persona in that poem feels that he has been rejected by his\n\n 'Princess'  because he is clearly too dark, and she is\n\npictured as safe in her  'fine castle'  , looking down on him\n\nand banishing him to the pens of the swine, a mere swineherd.\n There is little doubt that in his early days Walcott was much\n\nconcerned in his poetry with themes of colour, discrimination and rejection,\n\nof being on the periphery    .  \n to have\n\nbeen prickly, morose and deeply worried.\n The wife of a colonial official once said about him, as a young man,\n\nthat she knew no one who so strongly gave the impression of being disturbed\n\nand bleak.\n\n\n'She ought to know all about that, and the reasons for it \x13 is she not from\n\nSt Lucia?'  \n\n  One of his remarkable achievements \x13 most suitable to a Nobel\n\nLaureate \x13 had undoubtedly been his movement from exorcism to benediction.\n He had much to reject in the time and place of his birth, but he has\n\nbeen able to move from the necessary rejection of  'the works and\n\npomps of Satan'  to the acceptance of, and the building on, all that\n\nwas positive: his great gifts, his family's nurture, the  'good\n\ncolonial education'  which he received, the care of such people as\n\nHarry Simmons and the Irish brother who introduced him to Joyce and Yeats and\n\nIrish ballads. \n\n  Few people could have moved as he did from his early feelings of\n\nrejection to his wonderful taking over, in  Another life  , of\n\nFrancois Villon's  'I have swallowed all my hates'  . \n\n  From the culture of St Lucia into which Walcott was born another\n\nNobel Laureate also came: the late Sir Arthur Lewis, the economist.\n And one of Walcott's close friends and colleagues of his early days,\n\nDunstan St Omer, is an outstanding painter, as was Harry Simmons in a smaller\n\nfashion.\n This island country, of 180 square miles, also accounts for an\n\noutstanding musical genius, Luther Francois, and outstanding entrepreneurs\n\nsuch as the late Sir Garnett Gordon, and many writers. In fact the cultural\n\nlife of the place, despite poverty and prejudice, is a cause for wonder. \n\n  The cultural factors which first would have made any gifted\n\nperson such as Walcott uncomfortable, dissatisfied and rebellious, and which\n\nhe was later, with the touch of a true alchemist, to transmute to gold, are\n\nalluded to by the shabine, the main character in, and narrator of Walcott's\n\n The Schooner Flight  :  \n\n \n\n I had a sound colonial education,\n\n I have Dutch, nigger and English in me,\n\n and either I'm nobody, or I'm a nation...\n\n  Walcott's mother was his connection with the Dutch, through the\n\ntiny island of Sint Maartin. His father's father was from Warwickshire in\n\nEngland.\n Two of his grand parents were black; two white \x13 an expression of\n\nthe cultural mixture of his island home.\n St Lucia itself had been battled for by the French and English for\n\nsome two centuries: in the days of sail it controlled a wind route direct to\n\nthe Main.\n Fourteen times it changed hands between England and France.\n Just off its shores, at the battle of the Saintes ( 1793), the fate\n\nof France in North America and India was decided by Rodney's victory over De\n\nGrasse \x13 this is one of the starting points of Walcott's remarkable \n\nterza rima  novel/ poem  Omeros  . \n\n  So while the population was genetically African with a fair\n\nsprinkling of Carib and European, the cultures which were brewing together\n\nwere Trans-Atlantic African, French ( Pre and Post-Revolutionary) British (\n\nmainly through schooling and the English language it taught), heavily\n\nRoman Catholic, with a small but staunch Methodist presence.\n Both Walcott and Lewis came from Methodist families.\n By the time Walcott was growing up, English was the language of the\n\nschools and civil service; French Creole the language of the countryside and\n\nthe streets; French of the Creole families who had escaped from the\n\nRevolutionary islands, and a Creole of English was spreading.\n your\n\nethnic cleanser, white or black, Catholic or Protestant, Muslim or\n\nrationalist, would have despaired. \n\n  One of the marks of Walcott's greatness, it seems to me, is that\n\nwhile many of us would have done our best to deny the  'mixture'\n\n generated in our culture through history and European geopolitics,\n\nand a few of us would have merely accepted it, Walcott used it and the\n\nexperience that it brought, to make poetry of the highest quality.\n In doing this he has also enriched that language which first came\n\nfrom England \x13 that glorious and growing language which so many, who should\n\nknow better, are now trying to persuade us, especially in the  'United\n\nKingdom'  , stopped developing, even perhaps died, with Shakespeare\n\nand the King James translation of the Bible!\n He has also clearly shown by his art how the influence of the\n\nlanguages brought by brutalised slaves from Africa has been giving birth to\n\nnew extensions of language throughout the Caribbean. \n\n  But Walcott's greatness lies not only in his feeling for the\n\nwhole of his spiritual/ physical/ intellectual environment, and his ability\n\nto work through all of it, but also in his dedication to work \x13 the dictum of\n\nHorace's about using the   labor limae   , he\n\ntook whole-heartedly to his poetry. \n\n  But poetry is neither mainly a matter of concerns or of hard\n\nwork; it is hewn, or in a few cases comes as if by magic, from a particular\n\nnexus of language and music.\n It combines a creative insight into tradition with an ability to\n\nexperiment, to extend the confines into other regions. \n\n  So one must refer \x13 one has not space to do more than that \x13 to\n\nWalcott's magical ability with language and his ability to handle many verse\n\nforms, and to extend them \x13 whether sonnet or terza rima or quatrain.\n his extension of the sonnet\n\nform and of end rhyme into internal patterns which create new richness in the\n\nuse of assonance.\n From early on he revealed an ability to create meaning through the\n\ncombination of varieties of not only registers but languages.\n Shabine, who is not only of mixed race\n\nand culture, but a Creole speaker, narrates the whole of the poem in an idiom\n\nnot only suitable to creating verisimilitude but to communicating in a\n\nspecial way certain meanings not easily communicated in a monolingual display\n\nof  the STANDARD LANGUAGE'  . \n\n  'fishing the\n\ntwilight for alternate voices his own voice'  .\n as his\n\nyouthful exuberance disclosed too easily his vast reading of both English and\n\nFrench poets.\n .\n But certainly that is always at most half the battle.\n He also had some thing to say \x13 something meaningful, not only to\n\nNazareth but to Rome, Nairobi and New York \x13 even to London, which is always\n\na bit narky about him \x13 after all he has deserted not only the negative\n\nunderstatement London so loves but also the Empire, and lives half the year\n\nin AMERICA! ( the other half he spends in the Caribbean).\n Further, his great friends tend to be foreigners who do not\n\nunderstand that the only done thing, in showing that one is really \n\n'top drawer'  , is to pretend that one has nothing to say and is\n\nindeed rather boring! \n\n  In one sense his medium can be seen as flowing against his\n\n \x18message'  , for while the former appears to grow more and\n\nmore transparent, the latter never forgets, or attempts to hide, the fact\n\nthat it comes from a complicated situation \x13 a situation as multicultural and\n\n 'impure'  as it is possible to imagine. \n\n  I have referred above, by implication, in quoting the fleeing\n\nShabine, to the cultural variety of Trinidad, his native land.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1bb4e3a1-97cc-4625-b5fb-6836d1fc23bc', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.321539+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9884036183357239, 'non_english_score': 0.011596381664276123}
{'text': 'A writer of fiction does not, I believe, write narrative to\n\nconvert, to disturb, to instruct, to reassure, or to challenge readers,\n\nexcept perhaps to challenge their understanding of themselves.\n One sets out to write because narrative gives value to experiences\n\nthat might otherwise vanish, and writing immortalizes things.\n To write is to learn, to bring knowledge unexpectedly about oneself,\n\nand to discover truth as one goes along.\n But to think seriously about writing is to convince oneself that one\'s\n\nimaginative prompting and experiences will provide an inexhaustible\n\nsource.\n But is one ever convinced?\n Writing line after line, one can never be free of misgivings for there\n\nis always a great distance between what is seen in the mind\'s eye and on the\n\npaper.\n The writer may be pleased with a phrase, a paragraph, or even a page.\n She may regard her description of a certain scene or character with\n\napproval, but self-doubt always lingers in the mind.\n Having written something, the writer wants to share it with someone\n\nand yet is afraid to have it scrutinized by others.\n She is afraid of baring her innermost thoughts, of exposing her soul.\n And yet her work has to be seen.\n For a writer\'s work appears to be of little value if the public does\n\nnot approve of it.\n Approval and praise by others reassure the writer and provide the\n\ndrive to continue, strengthening her wavering conviction that the source will\n\nnot dry up. \n\n  Writing, like any other human endeavor, needs praise and approval\n\nif it is to grow.\n And yet the writer of fiction, like a poet or a painter, pursues art\n\nprimarily to satisfy an innate self-yearning.\n How the writer\'s work affects the public could be a matter of\n\nmaterial rather than spiritual concern.\n But it is human to be pleased when one\'s work gives pleasure or when\n\nothers praise it.\n But what if approval and praise never come?\n An artist should find a reward in having satisfied the creative\n\ninstinct.\n Yet that reward alone will not be enough, so the writer tries to get\n\nher work published. \n\n  My inclination to write arose from a strong desire to use words\n\naptly, vividly, to describe people and scenes, to make them real.\n I have always admired beauty and richness in writing, sentences\n\nstrung together so eloquently that they fall like muse on a reader\'s ear.\n I like phrases and paragraphs that a reader would read and reread,\n\npause and reflect on, unwilling to leave behind: \n " The moon rises red from out of the still water of the bay.\n The hanging nets throw a dark shadow on the beach... the serried row\n\nof nets have come to rest under the trees... and only the water is unquiet\n\nwith the pull of the tide" ( Roger Mais,  The Hills Were\n\nJoyful Together  ) . \n\n  But what you want to write and how you write are different\n\nmatters.\n I had written many stories in my mind before feeling compelled to\n\ntake up pen.\n And the ideas I thought originally had led me to begin writing were\n\nno longer inspiring.\n I was unexpectedly learning something about myself.\n My desire to write, it occurred to me, was an urgent desire to be\n\nheard.\n I wanted to write because in the act of writing I was denying myself\n\nthe mutedness that had been imposed on me as a woman in a patriarchal\n\nsociety.\n In the act of writing I enjoy a sense of liberation from\n\ndisappointment and hurts, a feeling of security and freedom. \n\n  I discovered that writing was hard work, for it demands time.\n\nAnd for a woman who is also a wife and mother engaged in a full-time career,\n\ntime for writing is very scarce.\n Writing takes sustained and uninterrupted stretches of time, and\n\nwith the division of labor we have been blessed with,  " women have\n\nbeen required to produce time for men.\n Women have different working conditions from men, men have a right\n\nto write which women do not." \n Traditionally, men writers have had only one job; women writers have\n\nhad two.\n By producing time for men, women have lost some of their own time,\n\nfor there is little time left after family needs have been attended to.\n " women never\n\nhave half an hour they can call their own." \n For women with children it is difficult or impossible to find half a\n\nminute for themselves. Virginia Woolf\'s comment that early famous women\n\nwriters had no children is no coincidence.\n A woman with family commitments must steal time to write, feel\n\nguilty about neglecting duties, and have that guilt reinforced when a thread\n\nof thought is suddenly broken as someone asks,\n What\'s for lunch?\n Where is the pen I left on the bed?\n Is it two cups of sugar or one?\n Motherhood means being available to be interrupted, responsive,\n\nresponsible.\n The first two are qualities not necessarily required of a father.\n\n\n\n  Men are serviced but women do the servicing.\n The situation for men who are writers is different.\n They are shielded from the daily business of living, and women\n\nprovide that shield.\n Unlike men writers who have wives, there is no equivalent for women.\n Men operate from a different context in which servicing remains\n\ninvisible and unknown.\n They appear to be severed from day-to-day existence.\n " are sincerely ignorant\n\nof the processes that supply their comforts, strangers to blisters and\n\nbackaches." \n The situation for women writers is very different, for even if some\n\ndomestic chores are relegated to paid help, the social convenience would be\n\nmissing as well as the effortless spontaneity of the author\'s reliance on his\n\nwife. \n\n \n " To be a female human being, trying to fulfill traditional\n\nfemale functions in a traditional way is in direct conflict with the\n\nsubversive function of the imagination.\n There must be ways \x13 and we must find out more about them \x13 in which\n\nthe energy of creation and the energy of relation can be united"\n\n( Rich, 1979:43).\n That women\'s lives are bounded on all sides by needs, husbands, and\n\nchildren means that women will tend to write differently than men, for their\n\nviews will be grounded in a very different reality.\n For women, it is not possible to ignore the servicing or its\n\nimplications.\n\n " When Mrs. Carlyle told her husband that on a previous\n\noccasion she had thought of leaving him, he replied,\n \'I don\'t know that I would have missed you.\n I was busy with Cromwell just then.\'\n He would of course have missed her as soon as he felt hungry or\n\nneeded a change of clothes.\n But the master can afford the luxury of forgetting his reliance on\n\nhis slave, whereas the condition of slavery can never be forgotten.\n\n But what may be permanently present in the minds of women may be\n\nnonexistent in the minds of men.\n The drudgery of which Glastonbury speaks may be invisible.\n Women are not required to perform it, but it is unreal if they wish\n\nto create it in their writing.\n\n\n  Of course, both sexes experience problems inherent in writing.\n\n " You have to begin it and stick at it through many long and\n\nsolitary hours and at the point every writer feels unsure, voice<l> less and\n\nguilty" ( Fairbanks, 1978:247). \n\n  Fiction has often been regarded as the most successful genre for\n\nwomen writers because the novel makes use of the domestic scene or the life\n\nof the feelings or  " trivial"  observations, all supposedly\n\nclose to women\'s experience.\n " it is because that scene is the\n\nworld of social relations of inter-subjectivity, in which the author can\n\nreconcile to some extent her speech and her silence."  \n\n  My first novel seems to support that suggestion.\n is a narrative rooted in the\n\ndomestic scene: the life of the feelings and so- called trivial\n\nobservations abound.\n I have tried to deal with some aspects of Miss Milly\'s feelings as a\n\nsingle parent, poor, obscure, a working-class woman with typical\n\nworking-class problems, with a strong desire to improve her son\'s economic\n\nand social condition through education.\n She is dedicated to her son\'s needs, and because she is solely\n\nresponsible for him, she gives them primacy. \n\n \n " Working class women, illiterate or literate, play\n\nvirtually no part in the conversion of raw material into\n\nliterature," states Glastonbury ( 1979:172),   " since\n\ntheir preoccupations are not convertible into the accepted currency of truth\n\nin the patriarchal order.\n The prevailing definition of reality necessarily makes working-\n\nclass women and their lives invisible."\n\n  Miss Milly dominates the narrative of my novel in much the same\n\nway that she dominates the life of her son Wilby, especially just before the\n\ncommon entrance examination.\n She is neither muted nor invisible, though at times she chides\n\nherself for not  " holding her tongue"  when she speaks with\n\nWilby\'s father, a man who only marginally contributes to his son\'s\n\nupbringing.\n her fear of\n\nlosing Wilby or even Lenny would not haunt her.\n Miss Milly\'s love for her son drives her to stifle him.\n Wilby is so distressed that he finds ways to rebel.\n His father\'s infrequent visits lighten the yoke he feels Miss Milly\n\nhas placed on his young life. \n\n  Wilby cannot understand that his mother\'s dream is to help him\n\nescape the dullness and drudgery of her life.\n He may make such an escape only by passing the common entrance\n\nexamination.\n It is the first step he must take if he is to climb out of the\n\npoverty he has inherited and for which Milly feels responsible.\n The common entrance examination is a source of yearly anxiety to\n\nmany parents as well as children, regardless of their socioeconomic class.\n For a poor working-class woman like Milly, the anxiety is\n\nheightened because if Wilby fails to secure a place in a prestigious\n\nsecondary school, in Miss Milly\'s view he will be able to do no better than\n\nbe a part-time calypsonian like his father or a professional  "\n\nstandpipe philosopher"  like his

She knows\n\nit is difficult for the boy to concentrate on his homework as the music seeps\n\ninto their small house.\n Still, she encourages Wilby to work harder.\n Then, ten days before Carnival Tuesday, the news that calypso\n\nsinging and mas playing are part of the school curriculum turns Miss Milly\'s\n\nanxiety to rage.\n For the distractions have multiplied and she is angry, especially\n\nagainst the people in the ministry, who  " can\'t see they trying to\n\nkeep poor people\'s children like Wilby from studying hard." \n The added distractions increase Milly\'s resolve to ensure that Wilby\n\nspend more time with his books.\n Playing cricket with Tallboy in the savannah will not be tolerated.\n But Wilby uses his own devices to outwit Miss Milly.\n When he excels in sports and the calypso competition, his mother is\n\nso wounded that she is unable to share his achievements, and Wilby is deeply\n\nhurt.\n But experience has taught Milly that the only way to real success\n\nis through  " book learning,"  and she believes that academic\n\nsuccess for Wilby will liberate them from the constraints of poverty and\n\nimprove the quality of their lives. \n\n  When I finally came to write the last line of the story, after\n\nmany interruptions and countless hours, I discovered that writing was much\n\nmore than putting words on paper, even beautiful words strung together.\n The narrative appeared to have taken me over.\n Whatever I was doing, the story was always in my mind, so that it\n\nbecame almost organic.\n It was a great relief to have finished.\n The story was no longer a part of me, and I felt a delicious sense\n\nof fulfillment.\n This feeling passed, and I began to hope that the story would be of\n\nsome value, that it would get published, and yet I felt so tremendously\n\nrelieved and satisfied in my creative instinct that I postpone worrying about\n\nits value.\n I realize that the reader of a work of fiction or the viewer of a\n\npainting is not concerned with the artist\'s feelings.\n How well I have communicated with the reader will be a matter for\n\nthe reader to decide.\n Artistic creation is an activity that is satisfied by its own\n\nexercise in creating the story, the picture, or the poem. \n\n  The techniques of any art or craft can only be acquired through\n\narduous labor.\n Writing, like any other work, has to be pursued vigorously and\n\ncontinuously.\n\n\nticeship, I hope I may write well, write much, and make a habit of writing.\n I would like to be able to develop a writing style that is lucid,\n\nsimple, euphonic, vivid, sensitive, and harmonious.\n I would like to achieve success as a writer of fiction so that\n\nmy character can develop as I continue to discover myself and the many selves\n\nthat a writer is made up of.\n To present society as the writer sees it, it is not necessary to\n\ncopy life.\n The writer thinks with the narrative and can make an arrangement\n\nout of reflections of experiences, strong responses, and imaginative\n\npromptings to achieve that purpose.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'fccc1e15-fd9b-473f-99b8-8733e9ba4d20', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.322768+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9823394417762756, 'non_english_score': 0.017660558223724365}
{'text': 'In the early 1960s I started to seek out the women of Jamaica\'s\n\npast during the period of slavery, women of all classes and of all colors,\n\nblack, brown, white.\n I had no feminist motivation, or at least none that I recognized.\n I was motivated mainly by intellectual inquisitiveness, the usual\n\nambition of the doctoral candidate to investigate virgin territory, which it\n\nwas at that time.\n There was almost nothing to guide such a search.\n There was, in fact, nothing in modern historical scholarship about the\n\nwomen who came before me.\n But this was not surprising, for historiography, which has for\n\ncenturies been a male academic preserve, has been stunningly devoid of a\n\nconsciousness of women as significant beings. \n\n  So feminist historians have been faced with the methodological\n\nchallenge of excavating women from layers of distortion and obscurity,\n\nof getting beyond and behind the formal roles conventional history has\n\naccorded them and in the process, perhaps, even transforming the dis <l>\n\ncipline of history. \n\n  Digging into the lives of the small minority of free white women\n\nin Jamaican slave society takes one along a relatively straightforward route.\n There is a substantial body of data to be found in contemporary\n\nhistories and accounts by residents and travelers: there is even more\n\nvaluable material in legal documents, in wills, in diaries, and in the volume\n\nof transatlantic and inter-American correspondence that has been preserved in\n\nthe papers of planter families.\n Letters and diaries of women of this class reveal some of the\n\npersonal and domestic implications of absentee proprietorship, an alienating\n\nphenomenon that has been distinguished throughout most of Jamaica\'s history\n\nby the nostalgia of its white elite for all things English, an intensely\n\nfemale nostalgia that is communicated through the pens of women with\n\nperturbing immediacy. \n\n  Other approaches are required to recover the feelings of brown\n\nand black women and to gain insight into the multidimensional nature of their\n\nlives.\n Until the very recent development of indigenous scholarship, the\n\nCaribbean researcher\'s main reference point was the Eurocentric, eth <l>\n\nnocentric historiography of the colonizer and the slaveholder, which is\n\nincapable of addressing the humanity of transplanted Africans labeled\n\nchattel, identified for the historical record in an entry on a bill of lading\n\nor an estate inventory and rendered voiceless.\n The state of slavery further compounds the methodological challenge\n\nin that women and slaves, as oppressed groups, themselves frequently suppress\n\ntheir objective reality.\n Their words, if we could only hear them, may have been designed not\n\nto reveal but to conceal, not to inform but to misinform. \n\n  In attempting to decode the mysteries of the black female\n\ncondition, the Caribbean scholar is at greater risk than her Afro-American\n\ncounterpart, who can study collections of slave narratives, with\n\nopportunities for testing their authenticity.\n Nothing has surfaced to date in the Jamaican records comparable to\n\nthe statements of a Sojourner Truth, or a Harriet Tubman, or the remarkable\n\ntestimony of the slave woman Harriet Jacobs, whose autobiography has only\n\nrecently come to light. \n\n  Only one woman of color has left a strong imprint on the pages of\n\nJamaica\'s past, leaving literary evidence of her lively existence: this was\n\nMary Seacole.\n Wonderful\n\nAdventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands  , was first published in\n\nEngland in 1857.\n It is a vivid, witty account of the life of a spunky mulatto woman\n\nwho labeled herself a  " female Ulysses." \n Her ambition and wanderlust took her as innkeeper, huckster, and\n\nnurse to Haiti, Cuba, the Bahamas, Panama, England, and the battlefield of\n\nthe Crimea, where she became celebrated as the  " brown Florence\n\nNightingale." \n Her portrait dominated the platform of the Hall at the University of\n\nthe West Indies in Jamaica, where I lived and worked during the years of my\n\nresearch. \n\n  occurred\n\nduring the post  -  emancipation period and therefore fell for the\n\nmost part outside of my research time frame, but I expected to meet her on my\n\njourney.\n I did, and certainly she came alive through the picture she drew of\n\n herself  .\n Today\'s Caribbean women writers will be intrigued to explore the\n\nvalue of her contribution to our literary heritage, for her autobiography is\n\nboth a historical document and a creative work, a unique expression of the\n\nfemale mulatto syndrome. \n\n  Nanny of the Maroons was more enigmatic.\n For as long as I can remember, she has been somewhere in the\n\nJamaican consciousness but without acquiring solid flesh and blood.\n Was she actually an Ashanti chieftainess who wielded power over her\n\npeople in the Portland mountains of eastern Jamaica and kept the\n\nestablishment at bay for years as she led the war of black liberation,\n\nfrustrating colonial designs to make the island free for King Sugar?\n Or was she a creature of legend, summoned up by the Maroons from the\n\nspirit world to sustain their struggle for freedom?\n The supernatural powers attributed to her in popular sayings seemed\n\nso bizarre as to produce scepticism about her humanness.\n I did not know precisely how much I would discover about this heroic\n\nbut insubstantial figure, and if one rejected the folk memory as a valid base\n\nfor scholarly theses, was there any certainty of finding incontestable\n\nevidence that she had really lived? \n\n  The twilight zone Nanny inhabited symbolized the hazy state of\n\nour knowledge about our black foremothers.\n Records existed, most of them the result of the very nature of the\n\nslave society and economy.\n Estate papers and slave registration returns are rich in the\n\ndemographic data compiled by proprietors and managers to keep account of the\n\nsize, age, physical condition, occupation, and other attribute of their human\n\nproperty.\n Colonial Office and parliamentary reports provide prime evidence of\n\nthe strategic and commercial interests of imperialism, which shaped the\n\nisland polity and made precise prescriptions for the functioning of each\n\nracial group and, above all, of each unit of the work force.\n There are data in abundance, but there is very little about the inner\n\nlives of slaves. \n\n  Clearly, one must probe deeply into the conventional sources of\n\nCaribbean history to find those missing women, to attempt new interpre\n\n<l> tations, and imaginatively to bring new insights to the task of opening\n\nup the  private world, where black women lived in cultural an\n\n<l> tithesis to the white plantation.\n The historical, sociological, and creative writings of Orlando\n\nPatterson and Edward Kamau Brathwaite in the 1960s and early 1970s indicated\n\nhow and where one might find that Afro-Caribbean world.\n\n\npology and sociology, psychology and literature and archaeology, and whatever\n\nelse is needed to make the fragments whole."\n In the 1960s, however, we were along distance away from refining\n\nmultidisciplinary scholarship. \n\n  Understandably, I was nervous about embarking on my venture with\n\nsuch undeveloped professional tools.\n But I was inspired and supported by a friend and teacher, and a\n\ngreat woman, Elsa Goveia.\n And there could be no more appropriate occasion than this historic\n\ngathering of Caribbean women writers at which to pay tribute to her shining\n\nspirit and towering intellect: she was a native of Guyana, the first female\n\nprofessor and the first professor of West Indian history at the University of\n\nthe West Indies.\n Sadly, she died too soon, eight years ago, at the age of fifty-five.\n But what a legacy she has left us!\n Her first major publication in 1956 was a study of the\n\nhistoriography of the British West Indies.\n In it she dissected with a cool and devastating critique the\n\nracialist and authoritarian ideologies of those historians who, under the\n\nguise of academic objectivity and humanist values, previously attempted to\n\nrecord the Caribbean past. \n\n  Slave\n\nSociety in the British Leeward Island at the End of the Eighteenth Century\n\n .\n In his annual lecture in her memory at the University of the West\n\nIndies, Professor Franklin Knight aptly described that work as  "\n\nmagisterial."  \n\n  Professor Goveia\'s piercing vision and rigorous scholarship\n\nbrought fresh understanding of the complex historical forces that have shaped\n\nour island societies.\n Brilliantly, meticulously, she analysed the decisive force of race\n\nand color in constructing Leeward Islands society, demonstrating how  "\n\nthe social order of the whole community hung upon the distinctions\n\nestablished between the constituent races." \n Simultaneously, she identified the propensity of those same\n\nconstituents to destabilize the social order.\n Her thesis tempted me with prospects of an exciting dialectical\n\nexploration to illuminate the buried lives of women: if the fact that she was\n\nblack, or white, or brown ascribed to a woman her status, her functions,\n\nand her subversive potential, would her being female make a difference?\n In short, how far would her sexual identity diminish or enhance her\n\ncapacity to conform or to resist? \n\n  It took time, of course to find answers, and a great deal of\n\npatience, like that of the gold prospector, sifting through tons of material\n\nin search of the occasional nugget of enlightenment.\n But fragments of women\'s lives came to light increasingly out of the\n\nshadows of the archives, and the contours of black, brown, and white women\'s\n\nstories took shape. \n\n  The combined ideologies of white supremacy and patriarchalism\n\nlaid down clear guidelines for the status and functioning of white women in a\n\nplantation colony.\n The majority, conditioned to accept such concepts, performed\n\naccordingly, but not all did.\n Some proved capable of flouting convention, of engaging in economic\n\nactivities that did not fit the white female stereotype, of indulging in\n\nunbecoming social conduct, of violating interracial sexual taboos.\n Women of the plantocracy struck out with even more spirit in some\n\nways than women of lesser classes, making definitive statements of white\n\nfemale distaste for Creole norms.\n Many came, saw, and fled, leaving behind awkward social and domestic\n\ngaps that threatened to undermine the nice designs of the establishment.\n\n\n\n  Colored women had their allotted place, initially a marginal\n\none.\n But selective co-option carried some to the status of surrogate\n\nwhites, who served partially to defuse the racial imbalance, ten blacks to\n\none white, the highest in the transatlantic plantations and a terrifying\n\nspecter to the white establishment.\n Numbers of brown women exploited openings in Creole society, carving\n\nout for themselves significant roles that had not been previously prescribed,\n\nvirtually inverting the social order.\n Such processes, within the context of Jamaica\'s sexual and racial\n\ndemography, have important implications for brown women\'s assertive capacity\n\nto influence the shaping of a society.\n But under the close scrutiny of research, the black slave woman\n\nemerged as the most aggressive of women: she took center stage as rebel. \n\n  Rebels on the run are usually the first to catch posterity\'s\n\neye, for as valuable property that had to be recovered when they fled their\n\nestates, they made copy in the local press.\n gave them\n\nnames, faces, and identities.\n They became conspicuous in the fugitive population, confounding\n\ncustomary perceptions of the passive sex, whose physical mobility is\n\nconstrained by motherhood. The female runaway often made sure her children\n\njoined her escape from bondage in what was one of the most threatening forms\n\nof protest, for each missing person, man, woman, or child, jolted the system.\n\n\nrogues\'  gallery.\n " slender black woman, with a large eye, prominent\n\nforehead and straight nose, and marked CH or MH"  ; her daughter\n\nEliza Arnold was also  " slender, with very large eyes, and a thin\n\nvisage"  ; and her son Richard McHead, aged eighteen, accompanied\n\nthem.\n "\n\nplausible trio,"  they had crossed the length of the island from the\n\nnorthwestern parish of Hanover and were hiding somewhere in the city of\n\nKingston in the southeast.\n They and others like them moved through a black underground that\n\nsustained fugitives for long periods, over long distances, in the countryside\n\nor in the busy subculture of the island\'s growing towns. \n\n  " incorrigible"\n\n slaves who ran away again and again, risking recapture and\n\npunishment, which increased in severity for each repeated offense.\n When caught and returned to the plantation, they made common cause\n\nwith an equally  " incorrigible"  band of rebels, the\n\nindustrial saboteurs.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'ab584877-f825-402c-82e0-fba4dbc485bb', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.324226+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9673497080802917, 'non_english_score': 0.03265029191970825}

for example, marronage, that tradition of resistance\n\nscience that establishes an alternative psychic space both within and beyond\n\nthe boundaries of the enslaving plantation.\n\n\ngriot  as narrator clearly tests the boundaries of the oral and the\n\nscribal, operating as it does on the edge of speech and writing, to cite\n\nGlissant again. \n\n  The poetry of Luise Bennett, Micey Smith and Jean Binta Breeze\n\nrepresents a further stage along the scribal/oral continuum.\n Explicitly performance texts, these poems, though composed with\n\nclear reference to both oral and scribal literary traditions, are actualised\n\nin contexts of more-than-verbal production.\n Though the poem ( as script) may be available in print, the\n\nperformance itself cannot be printed.\n Audio- visual technology, rather than the printed word, best records\n\nthe total theatre that is performance poetry. \n\n  and\n\nMichael Thelwell\'s novelisation of the film  The Harder They Come \n\nare included as doubly engaging examples of transitional narrative forms.\n As fictionalised ( auto)biography both narratives explore the\n\nrelationship between identity and the explicatory ordering of the life story;\n\nas scribalised oral forms they raise theoretical issues about marginality and\n\nthe boundaries of voice and print.\n Both works, focusing in large measure on the impact of migration\n\nfrom rural Jamaica to the concrete jungle of Kingston, are centrally con <l>\n\ncerned with a collision of values that tests the authority of the oral\n\ntradition.\n On issues of gender and social order the brash revisionism of the\n\nghetto youth\'s cries for social justice challenges the wisdom of the\n\nconservative peasant culture. \n\n  The lyrics of the reggae musician and the DJ, related in\n\nperformance terms to the poetry of Bennett, Breeze and Smith constitute the\n\nfourth group of texts to be examined.\n The least scribal of the texts under consideration, they become the\n\nmost    de-contextualised   in the\n\nkind of close verbal/textual reading to which they are subjected here.\n History of the\n\nVoice  draws deliberate attention to the sound and not simply the sight\n\nof the text.\n The basic limitation of this sighted focus on lyrics is that\n\nrelatively little attention is given to analysis of the non-verbal elements\n\nof production and performance: melody, rhythm, the body in dance and the\n\ndancefloor itself as a space of spectacle and display.\n Relatively little attention is paid to the institutions of\n\nmusic production or to assessing the degree to which modes of production and\n\nperformance reinforce or undermine the power relations identified at\n\nplay in the lyrics.\n But the value of the analysis of disembodied lyrics is that the\n\n \'noise\'  of the reggae musician and the DJ is heard as\n\nintelligible and worthy of serious critical attention. \n\n  The power of Bob Marley\'s lyrics has been universally acclaimed.\n Singing in a language close to the English end of the\n\nlinguistic continuum in Jamaica, but with clearly  rootsical  vibes,\n\nMarley sold himself internationally.\n The efficient marketing strategies of the Island Records empire made\n\nBob Marley a superstar.\n Raw talent would not have been enough without the operations of\n\ninternational capital.\n Indeed, Bob Marley was not a better singer than Peter Tosh or Bunny\n\nWailer; he was an opportunist, in the best sense of that word.\n The lyrics of the DJs in the present sample cannot be favourably\n\ncompared to Bob Marley\'s, with the striking exception of Lloyd Lovindeer\'s.\n They nevertheless deserve attention because of their massive appeal.\n can be simply dismissed as yet\n\nanother example of the increasing vulgarity of both rural and urban life in\n\nJamaica.\n Or, it can be recognised as a profoundly malicious cry to upset the\n\nexisting social order.\n Night noises that pollute middle- class neighbourhoods, disturbing a\n\nneighbour\'s sleep, are a threatening challenge to those uneasily awake\n\nin comfortable beds.\n from his\n\n Uprising  album:  \n\n \n\n Can\'t get mi out of the race\n\n Oh man you said I\'m in your place\n\n And then you draw bad card\n\n A make you draw bad card&\n\n \n\n Cause I\'m feeling so right\n\n I want to turn up my disco\n\n Blow them to full watts tonight\n\n Ina rub-a-dub style\n\n  This is the politics of noise.\n The literal reference to megawattage noise also evokes, however\n\nunintentionally, the Watts  \'riots\'  / uprisings and the blow\n\n<l> ing-up of placid assumptions about the appropriate place/space for the\n\ninsurgent Africa in the diaspora. \n\n  A problem surfaced as I tried to determine the sequence in which\n\nthese essays should be ordered for publication.\n Jane\'s Career\n\n , the first West Indian novel in which the  \'dialect\'  -\n\nspeaking <fnr>  2  <fnr> character is the central consciousness.\n\n\n patois\n\n alternates in popular usage with  dialect  , which has been\n\nsuperseded ( in the academy) by  Jamaican Creole  or the more\n\ngeneric ( pan-Caribbean)  Creole  - for good linguistic reasons.\n which I prefer\n\nbecause it moves towards settling the issue of the status of the language as\n\nthe legitimate expression of the ethos of a people.\n\n\nCreole  interchangeably, especially in contexts where ambiguity might\n\narise in the use of  Jamaican  as noun or adjective. \n But I intuitively knew that since the tradition of the spoken word\n\npreceded the scribal there was another kind of logic that was requiring me to\n\nbegin with the noises of  neo-oral  verbal creativity.\n I wanted Bennett to come before DeLisser.\n Jane\'s\n\nCareer  ,  \'Throwing Words\'  , a Jamaicanism for the sly\n\nact of casting aspersions without naming the object of abuse, voices an\n\nideological problem with DeLisser\'s representation of Jane\'s career which\n\nmade me unwilling to give him primacy of place: DeLisser\'s instinct is\n\nessentially satirical.\n Knowledge of Jamaican and facility in its use do not necessarily\n\nextend to shared sympathies with its habitual speakers.\n Boundaries of colour, class and gender seem to define the limits of\n\nDeLisser\'s conception of Jane\'s career.\n Her middle-class ambitions are derided as the fanciful vulgarity of\n\nher group.\n in the little world\n\nof urban hurry- come-ups in Kingston is itself evidence of the triviality of\n\nthat world. \n\n  In addition, I somewhat illogically wanted to preserve the\n\narbitrary order of the actual evolution of the essays.\n The order of writing reflects the loose nature of this project which\n\nwas not originally conceived as a book. It grew organically.\n The present Chapter 2 was written for the 21st Anniversary Symposium\n\non the Cultural Heritage of Jamaica, convened in 1983 by the African\n\nCaribbean Institute of Jamaica/Folklore Studies Committee; in 1984/85 there\n\nfollowed the present Chapter 3 on  \'Female sensibility in the poetry\n\nof Louise Bennett\'  which developed out of a lecture to a class in\n\nWest Indian Literature; and then also in 1985,  \'Afro-Jamaican  <->\n\nFoklore <->  Folkore   Elements in Brodber\'s  Jane and Louisa\n\nWill Soon Come Home  \'  ; and, finally, in 1986,  \'Chanting\n\nDown Babylon\'  ( now Chapter 7).\n It only then occurred to me that I had the core of an extended study\n\nof oral/scribal discourse in Jamaican literature. \n\n  I have resisted the temptation to rewrite these early essays,\n\nbut a few essential changes have been necessary. When, for example, in the\n\nessay on Bob Marley\'s lyrics, I wrote somewhat dismissively of the  \'inscrutable\n\nart of the DJ\'  , I did not anticipate that I would later penetrate\n\nthe lyrics in such excruciating detail: the crosses of the new convert.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '7a2aea5e-d12b-49f1-aea1-ffa052faafb6', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.325825+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9355586171150208, 'non_english_score': 0.06444138288497925}
{'text': "Imperial Policy and Colonial Sterling Balances 1943-56\n\n    \n * I would like to thank the British Council and the Association of\n\nCommonwealth Universities for the funding which made this research possible,\n\nthe Institute of Commonwealth Studies for the fellowship which\n\nfacilitated my research and Dr Robert Holland for his incisive comments on\n\nthe draft to this article. \n\n \n\n \n\n  Between 1943 and 1956 Britain's strategy for maintaining the\n\nsterling balances of its colonies was an important policy issue.\n These balances or sterling assets formed the external financial\n\nreserves of the colonies and represented, ultimately, colonial claims upon\n\nthe resources of the UK itself.\n The principal components of the colonial sterling balances were\n\nColonial Government Funds, Currency Funds, Marketing Board Reserves  and the reserves of commercial banks which were operating\n\nin the colonies but not investing locally. \n 1. The Government Funds consisted of the various central and local\n\ngovernment reserves and funds for which colonial governments acted as\n\nbankers.\n The Currency Funds were made up of sterling or sterling securities,\n\nequivalent to at least 100 per cent of the value of the local currency\n\nissued.\n It also included the profits from commission charges and the interest\n\non investments made by the colonial currency authorities.\n The Marketing Board Reserves consisted of the surplus funds which the\n\nvarious marketing boards had set aside for price stabilization, research and\n\ndevelopment.\n The percentage of the total colonial sterling balance represented by\n\nthese each of its main components, varied according to the economic earnings\n\nand the level of economic activities in the Colonies.\n For more details on the nature and the structure of the colonial\n\nsterling balances see T236/3562, Memorandum on the Sterling Assets of the\n\nBritish Colonies ( Col. No. 298), 18 Dec. 1953. \n Colonial sterling reserves were, theoretically, assets which could\n\nhave been withdrawn by the colonies without restrictions.  \n 2. T236/3562.\n Memorandum on the Sterling Assets of the British Colonies, 2-9.\n\n\n However, between 1943 and 1945 the contingencies of war made it\n\nimpossible for the British government to grant the colonies unrestricted\n\naccess to their own reserves. \n\n  In the post-war period the question of granting the colonies unre\n\n<l> gulated access to their sterling reserves posed a dilemma for the British\n\ngovernment.\n Britain could have reduced the burden of having to finance colonial\n\ndevelopment by allowing the colonies to meet their development costs from\n\ntheir sterling reserves.\n However, because of the devastation wrought by the war and the\n\ninstability which prevailed in the UK economy, especially between 1945 and\n\n1952, Britain was not in a position to satisfy the demand for goods and\n\nservices which would have been generated by colonial expenditure of\n\naccumulated sterling reserves.\n On the other hand, it could not have allowed the colonies to make\n\nunlimited purchases from the Dollar Area, their principal alternative source,\n\nbecause supplies had to be paid for in gold or dollars.\n The consequent drain on the gold and dollar reserves of the UK would\n\nhave added to the economic disequilibrium and further jeopardized the status\n\nof the pound as an international currency.\n Finally, so long as its economy was weak it was advisable for Britain\n\nto act promptly on the measures necessary to deal with the colonial balances.\n If it did not, subsequent increases in the size of the accumulated\n\ncolonial sterling reserves would have accentuated the threat posed by such an\n\n 'overhang'  of external claims on the UK economy. \n\n  Britain's plight was exacerbated by its obligations under the\n\nterms of the Anglo- American Loan Agreement of December 1945.\n According to the terms of this agreement, the UK was obliged to\n\nrestore the free convertibility of the pound sterling by abolishing all the\n\nrestrictions governing the conversion of pounds into other international\n\ncurrencies by July 1947.\n It was also committed to the reduction of the overall size of its\n\ntotal sterling liabilities, in other words, the sum total of all the sterling\n\nor sterling securities held by Britain's creditors. \n\n\n 3. For details on the Anglo- American financial negotiations in the\n\nwar and post-war years see following: R. Gardner,  Sterling Dollar\n\nDiplomacy in Current Perspective  ( new and expanded edition) ( New\n\nYork,1980); L.S. Pressnell,  External Economic Policy Since the War \n\n, Vol.1 ( London, 1986); R.

Hathaway,  The Ambiguous\n\nPartnership: Britain and America 1944-47  ( New York, 1981). \n The Americans were determined to ensure that Britain reduced its\n\naccumulated sterling liabilities, because they were poised to capitalize on\n\nthe escalation in the demand for goods and services that this would have\n\nprecipitated.  \n 4. See CO 852/584/1/19037/16.\n Washington to Joint American Secretariat.\n\n\n  Britain's attempt to restore the free convertibility of the pound\n\nproduced a major economic crisis in 1947. \n\n\n 5. For the effects of this crisis on imperial policy see A. Hinds,\n\n 'Sterling and Imperial Policy 1945-51'  ,  Journal of\n\nImperial and Commonwealth History  , 15, 2 ( 1987), 148-70. \n After this had been overcome by re-establishing controls, its\n\neconomic stability was soon threatened by another crisis in 1949 and the\n\nrepercussions of the Korean War which began in 1950.\n The latter led to a boom in world commodity prices which facilitated\n\nsteep increases in colonial sterling assets between 1950 and 1952.\n Amid all of this, Britain was still expected to honour its commitment\n\nto reduce the size of its accumulated sterling liabilities.\n These developments made the formulation of a policy to manage the\n\ncolonial sterling balances a particularly onerous task. \n\n  This article examines the attempt made by the British government\n\nto devise a policy to manage the expenditure of the sterling balances\n\naccumulated by the colonies between 1943 and 1956 - a topic yet to receive\n\nthe detailed scholarly attention it deserves.\n Hitherto issues relevant to the general question of British policy\n\ntowards the expenditure of colonial sterling balances have been analysed by\n\nthree scholars: Judd Polk, D.J  .  Morgan and B.R  . \n\nTomlinson.  \n ( New York, 1956) 175-206; D.J\n\n .  Morgan,  The Official History of Colonial Development  (\n\nLondon, 1980) II, 53-63 and 157-74; and B.R  .  Tomlinson,\n\n 'Indo-British Relations in the Post-Colonial Era: The Sterling\n\nBalances Negotiations 1947-49'  ,  Journal of Imperial and\n\nCommonwealth History  , 13, 3 ( 1985), 142-62. \n Polk's analysis of the sterling balances of the regional blocs which\n\ncomprised the British Empire is especially acute.\n However, while it is provocative with regard to the general factors\n\nshaping British policy, Polk, writing in 1956, could do little to unravel the\n\ncomplex debate within Whitehall.\n Morgan's work contains a lot of useful information.\n However, the author tended to narrate rather than interpret the\n\nissues.\n In addition, he did not pay sufficient attention to the conditions in\n\nthe British and international economies which influenced the UK's policy\n\ntowards the colonial sterling balances. Tomlinson's work focuses on the\n\nIndo-British sterling balances negotiations between 1947 and 1949.\n Despite his primary materials, Tomlinson gives readers only a limited\n\nidea of some of the overall factors that shaped Britain's colonial sterling\n\nbalances policy.\n This article attempts to bolster the existing literature by analysing\n\nthe extent to which imperial policy towards the management of the colonial\n\nsterling balances was determined by the state of the British economy.\n It also intends to show that the colonial development issue in\n\ngeneral, and colonial balances in particular, have to be seen in the context\n\nof distinctive phases in the UK's post-war economic travail, rather than - as\n\nis usual - a somewhat undifferentiated rendering of Britain's balance of\n\npayments disarray.\n In so doing it is concerned only with the sterling assets of those\n\ncolonies which remained under British control throughout the period under\n\nreview. \n\n \n\n  Before the Second World War the total sterling liabilities of the\n\nUK were about &pound;600 million,  \n British\n\nImperial Policy and Decolonization 1938-1964  , II ( London, 1989), 128.\n\nDoc. 5  'Sterling Balances'  , note by the Chancellor of the\n\nExchequer, 20 Dec. 1951, CAB 129/48.  an estimated &pound;100-\n\n&pound;150 million of which was owed to the colonies.  \n 'The Treatment of the Colonial Sterling\n\nBalances'  , draft memorandum by O.L  .  Williams forwarded to\n\nN.E  .  Young with a covering letter dated 4 May 1949.\n This memorandum was the Treasury's response to the Governor of the\n\nBank of England's request for a memorandum which examined the colonial\n\nsterling balances, colonial currency reserves and the prospects for colonial\n\nborrowing in London.\n See T236/3351, H. Wilson-Smith to Mr. Governor, 30 May 1949.\n\n\n During the war years the acquisition of unrequited exports, inflated\n\nprices and military expenditure by the British and Allied forces in the\n\ncolonies combined to produce a steady increase in the colonial sterling\n\nassets held in London.\n Table 1 indicates the pattern of this growth.\n During this period the imperial government did not formulate any\n\npolicy to deal with colonial sterling assets beyond allowing them to\n\naccumulate. \n\n  The absence of policy did not preclude government officials from\n\nconsidering ways in which the funds or reserves which comprised the balances\n\ncould be utilized.\n In May 1943 at a meeting to discuss the cost of living in Cyprus,\n\nBritish government officials examined the feasibility of using part of the\n\ncolonial currency fund to finance the cost of colonial development.  \n\n\n\n This led Sydney Caine, the Colonial Office Financial Adviser, to\n\nsolicit the views of Lord Keynes ( an adviser to the Treasury) on the\n\nimperial government's policy at this time of investing the increments to the\n\ncolonial currency fund in London, instead of spending it on current expenses\n\nor on capital development in the Colonies. \n\n\n\n Caine pointed to some of the benefits which might accrue to the\n\ngovernment if it adopted an alternative strategy and allowed the colonial\n\ngovernments to spend a portion of their reserves on colonial development\n\nprojects.\n 'would have precisely the same effect\n\non the Government's finances as if it raised a loan, i.e. the Government\n\nwould be drawing funds from the London market, and its net income would be\n\nlower by the interest on those funds'  .\n He juxtaposed this with the government's policy of allowing colonial\n\ngovernments to raise loans for colonial development on the London market,\n\nwhile simultaneously investing funds for future income in London, through\n\ntheir currency accounts.\n 'it looks as if\n\nit might be better to simplify the business by using the currency funds\n\ndirectly for the kind of expenditure which might otherwise by financed from\n\nloans'  .  \n\n\n  Caine felt that it might have been possible to make some kind of\n\nspecial arrangement with the currency authorities which would have\n\nfacilitated the short-term issue of Treasury bills, and thus allow colonial\n\ngovernments to raise loans locally.\n Although he believed that there were alternatives to the British\n\ngovernment's policy for managing the colonial sterling balances, Caine did\n\nnot believe that the existing system needed major reforms.\n He thought that apart from considering the possibility of making some\n\nkind of special arrangement to facilitate a local issue of the Treasury\n\nbills, there was  'no great advantage in a change in the current\n\npractice'   because the colonies were an\n\nintegral part of a much wider British financial system. \n\n\n  Keynes thought that Caine's analysis of the issue was complete\n\nand convincing.\n He added that the existing practice for dealing with the colonial\n\ncurrency reserve funds  'was designed, probably on purpose, to promote\n\na high degree of conservatism in development'  .  \n 13. T236/4090.\n\n He claimed that a colony would be more reluctant to spend money on\n\ndevelopment if it felt that it had to borrow rather than use its own funds.\n He added that, when the currency reserve was growing, to hold 100 per\n\ncent reserve  'in a form equivalent to gold ( i.e  .  external\n\nliquid assets) instead of having a proportionate fiduciary issue, tends to\n\nlead to an underestimation of the financial strength of the Colony'  .\n\n \n\n He thought there were alternatives to the excessive conservatism of\n\nthe present system, although he remained vague as to what they might be. \n\n  This exchange between Caine and Keynes set the stage for the\n\ndebate which shaped imperial policy towards the management of colonial\n\nsterling assets during the period under review.\n The main contributors to this debate were officials from the\n\nTreasury, the Colonial Office and the Bank of England.\n Discussions focused upon what many officials believed was,\n\nultimately, the principal contradiction in the imperial government's strategy\n\nrelative to the colonial sterling balances: colonial development was being\n\nfinanced out of scarce UK funds, while the colonies went on accumulating\n\nsterling balances in the metropole. \n\n  Between 1943 and 1945 the need for an alternative to the imperial\n\ngovernment's policy of simply allowing colonial balances to accumulate in\n\nLondon was supported by most Treasury officials.\n Notable among these was Ernest Rowe-Dutton, the Principal Assistant\n\nSecretary.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '418089cd-51e2-4d8f-abd3-19f2306cbcc6', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.327385+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9545329809188843, 'non_english_score': 0.04546701908111572}

J.A., 2/6/13, Kingston Common Council Minutes, 1834-1839.\n\n\n He also made money out of land speculation in Kingston.\n In the 1830s he bought and sold land to other Jewish retailers in\n\nWater Lane and Heywood Street and made a quick profit of 400 pounds sterling\n\non ten acres of land along the Windward Road. \n\n\n\n In the neighbouring parish of St. Andrew, he bought land from James\n\nBarrett, a black storekeeper, and made other purchases in the Half-Way-Tree\n\n   area   .  \n Barrett was a strong political supporter of\n\nHart\'s. \n By 1838, Hart had bought Bowden Estate in St. Thomas-in-the East,\n\n and he purchased the three thousand acres property\n\nat Harris Bay in St. Catherine.  \n\n\n Hart also acquired Hampshire and Philipsfield Pens in St. David, both\n\ntotalling five hundred and sixty acres.  \n\n Clearly, Daniel Hart was representative of the new class of local\n\nbusinessmen who invested profits in land which came on the market during the\n\nuncertain period surrounding emancipation.\n He was the first of a number of Jewish retailers to use their newly\n\nacquired wealth to challenge the political establishment by organising black\n\nand coloured voters, who were looking for alternatives to more conservative\n\nwhites and coloured candidates.  \n \'Jewish Politicians and Black Voters in Free\n\nJamaica\'  ,  Social History Project Newsletter,  , No. 9,\n\nJune 1984, pp. 6-10.  \n\n  In the first stages of his political career, Hart formed an\n\nalliance with Edward Jordon and Robert Osborn, whose newspaper benefitted\n\nfrom Hart\'s financial backing, and he won seats in the Kingston Common\n\nCouncil and in the St. Andrew Vestry with their help.  \n Kingston\n\nChronicle,  21 September, 1835. \n These early excursions into local politics also revealed his strong\n\nfollowing among the black electors.\n \'shads\n\nand mackerels\'  at election time has created this alliance.\n\n\nHart\'s   support as his opponents ridiculed his humble back <l>\n\nground and his lack of facility with Standard English.\n Both Hart and the black voters soon turned to politics to indemnify\n\nthemselves for the derision and scorn which the better off poured on them.\n\n<fnr>  17  <fnr> \n ( New York, 1851) pp.\n\n21-22;  Kingston Chronicle  , 29 August, 1835.  \n\n  Such an opportunity presented itself in 1836 when Hart broke with\n\nJordon and Osborn and challenged John Samuel Brown, a coloured merchant, for\n\none of the three Kingston seats in the Assembly. \n\n\n\n Hart\'s resounding success underscored the role of ethnicity and\n\ncolour in Kingston politics.\n Skillfully exploiting old animosities between the black and the\n\ncoloured groups, and receiving the undivided support of the Jewish\n\nfraternity, he also attracted some support from the white mercantile\n\ncommunity who were eager to embarrass the coloured grouping led by Jordon and\n\nOsborn.\n Hart\'s victory was based on a coalition of black and Jewish voters\n\nand a new and important  " party"  was now part of the\n\npolitical landscape of Kingston.  \n 19. C.O. 137/211, Sligo to Glenelg ( Private), 18 June, 1836.\n\n \n\n  Furthermore, the significance of this victory for Kingston\n\npolitics and what later happened in 1840 and 1841, lay not only in the depth\n\nof Hart\'s electoral support he generated among the nonvoting public. The\n\nstrong presence at the poll of apprentices revealed that Hart\'s elec <l>\n\ntioneering activities had gone beyond the traditional boundaries of\n\nregistered voters to include  \'well able-bodied apprentices\' \n\nand  \'sailor negroes\'  .\n \'rabble\'\n\n so as to prevent  \'respectable persons\'  from going\n\nto the poll, and this before 1838, when it would be  \'bad enough to be\n\njostled and ill-treated by former servants\'  at the hustings.  \n\n\n\n  \' &he was the representative of the black population.\n He was sent there by the blacks and his other friends.\n The white Christians had their representatives, and he hoped shortly\n\nto see the day when the blacks would send in their own representatives.\n [ Meanwhile,] his black friends looked up to him to protect\n\nthem.\'  \n\n\n  Moreover, Hart grasped every opportunity to solidify his support\n\namong the Kingston blacks.\n When the Assembly debated the proposal to terminate the\n\nApprenticeship System in 1838, Hart unsuccessfully tried to convince them\n\nthat June 28, 1838, the day of Queen Victoria\'s coronation would be a more\n\nsuitable date than August 1st.\n Although the planters and the coloured representatives argued that\n\nthe extra five weeks were crucial to ensure a    smooth\n\n  transition, Hart freed all his apprentices on June 28th, claiming\n\nthat his black supporters in Kingston preferred the earlier date.\n He also publicly defended the freed workers against wild rumours\n\nthat they had immediately refused to labour unless they were offered\n\nextravagant wages.  \n 25\n\nJuly, 1838.  \n\n  However, Hart\'s colourful sojourn in the Assembly was\n\nshortlived.\n In October 1838, he and four other representatives formed the\n\nminority of Assemblymen who supported the Imperial Prisons Act which was\n\nvehemently opposed by the planters and the coloured politicians because they\n\ninsisted it violated their legislative autonomy.\n " nationalism"\n\n set off by the political crisis which precipitated an early general\n\nelection.\n They encouraged Philip Lawrence, a wealthy Jewish merchant, who had\n\nclose ties to the plantation economy, and who enjoyed undivided support of\n\nthe white Kingston mercantile establishment, to oppose Hart.\n Confronted by the coalition of white and coloured voters, and having\n\nto share the Jewish vote, Hart\'s strength among the black constituency proved\n\nunequal to the task of returning him to the Assembly.  \n Morning\n\nJournal,  22 November , 1838. \n He now focused his political ambitions on the Kingston Common\n\nCouncil, then firmly ruled by Mayor Mitchel, who could count on the support\n\nof Messrs Jordon and Osborn, whose newspaper, the  Morning Journal \n\n, was dependent on the advertising support of the Kingston merchants.  \n 24. C.O. 137/230, Smith to Glenelg ( Private), 13 October, 1838.\n\n \n\n  The enfranchisement of the Jews and the free black and coloured\n\nmale population in 1831, altered the membership of the common council.\n By 1839, of the twenty four elected members, nine were white, eight\n\nwere coloured, four were Jews, and three were black.  \n 25. J.A, 2/6/13 \x13 Kingston Common Council Minutes, 1834-1839.\n\n\n Hart became the chief spokesman for a minority group of ten, made up\n\nof three coloureds, three blacks, and the four Jews, who were referred to as\n\nthe  \'Hartites\'  .\n They pushed for a lowering of taxes and strongly supported the\n\nGovernor in his efforts to reform the Kingston prisons, and specifically, the\n\nremoval of the Superintendent of the prison, against the wishes of Mitchel,\n\nJordon and Osborn.  \n\n The meeting became more stormy as each side traded abuse and\n\ninvective.\n In one such debate, Hart\'s speech became so raucous and abusive that\n\n \'people rushed into the court-house in scores to ascertain what was\n\nthe matter\'  .\n Before the enlarged audience of ordinary Kingstonians, Hart attacked\n\nhis coloured political opponents as former  \'liberals\'  who\n\nwould now  \'make slaves of the people and rob them of their rights and\n\nprivileges\'  .  \n 27.

{'text': 'Spanish place names, and distortions of some of those Spanish\n\nplace names, are the principal reminder that Jamaica was a Spanish colony for\n\n161 years, between 1494 when Columbus claimed the island in the name of\n\nFerdinand and Isabella of Spain, and 1655 when the Lord Protector of England,\n\nOliver Cromwell, launched his Western Design.\n Names such as St. Jago de la Vega, ( Santiago de la Vega), Oracabessa\n\n( Cabeza de Oro), Ocho Rios ( Las Chorreras), Rio Minho, Rio Cobre, Rio\n\nGrande all testify to a Spanish and indeed to a Jewish-Portuguese presence in\n\nthe island.\n Is Mathra Brae, possibly Mata da Praia?\n And then, there are the Pedro Plains ( wrongly pronounced), and Great\n\nPedro Bay, savanna-la- Mar, Mount Diablo ( Devil Mountain), Montego Bay (\n\nManteca Bay), Port Maria ( Port Mary), Port Antonio ( Port Anthony).\n There is of course Don Christopher\'s Point: and the name Spanish Town\n\nis a lasting reminder that Spanish settlers had built this little town near\n\nthe south coast to administer the small colony.\n The Spanish crown had recommended to Columbus that he name the island\n\nSantiago in honour of the patron saint of Spain \x13 Santiago ( St. James), but\n\nthe original Taino name " " Jamaica" " defied all efforts to\n\nchange it\n There is Rio Nuevo, Rio Bueno, Rio Magno, Port Esquivel, ( Juan de\n\nEsquivel was one of Jamaica\'s first Spanish governors), Potosi, Santa Cruz (\n\nHoly Cross), and Porus was possibly named after the Porras brothers who rose\n\nagainst Columbus during his one year sojourn in Jamaica  .  \n\n \n\n  The Genoese sea-captain, Christopher Columbus, working in the\n\nservice of castille, first sighted Jamaica on May 5, 1494, in the course of\n\nhis second voyage to the Americas.\n On his fourth and last voyage beginning in 1502 he was forced to land\n\nin Jamaica because of the poor condition of his ships.\n He was to remain in the island for one full year, from June 24th,\n\n1502 to June 29, 1503. \n\n  absorption of Jamaica into the\n\nEuropean system is part of the broader canvas of European expansion overseas,\n\nand the nature of European expansion had been influenced by specific\n\nfeatures of European society.\n The end of the fifteenth century saw the emergence of the nation\n\nstate in Europe generally.\n In Spain, which underwrote the voyages of Columbus, the formation of\n\nthe nation state had been accompanied by a seven hundred year war against the\n\nMoors and the reconquest by Christian ( Catholic  )  Spaniards of a\n\ncountry dominated by Islam.\n If Spanish Catholicism proved to be particularly bellicose and\n\naggressive it must be attributed, in part at least, to the reality that in\n\nthe fifteenth century religion and nationalism, religion and the formation of\n\nthe nation-state, had become inseparable in the Spanish mind.\n The fortunes of Holy Church, buttressed by an Inquisition which\n\nvetted men\'s beliefs with powers of life and death, were at once an ideology\n\nfor expansion, a justification for conquest, and a guarantee of eternal life.\n Not surprisingly, Ferdinand and Isabella ( of Aragon and Castille\n\nrespectively) were and remain   " Los Reyes Catolicos"\n\n  - the Catholic monarchs.\n At the same time, it would be an exaggeration to suggest that the\n\nSpanish religious instinct always presupposed piety.\n Benassar\'s description of Spanish life in the sixteenth century\n\nrecords for us aspects of the vulgarity and coarseness of daily life, the\n\nblasphemous conduct, and a sexual life that failed to measure up to the\n\nstandards imposed by Mother church on its flocks.\n Religious militancy did not preclude, either, a dedication to\n\nthe acquisition of material goods.\n Indeed, the association between materialsm and idealism is best\n\nsummarised by Bernal Diaz del Castillo who fought beside Hernan Cortes in\n\nMexico:\n\n\n  Another feature of Spanish life was the existence of black\n\nslavery in the Iberian peninsula.\n True it is that the enslavement of Africans in Spain was a\n\nsubstantially different thing from what it was to become in the Americas, but\n\nthe concept of enslavement of man by man was justified by practice, and\n\nentrenched in the regulatory laws of Alfanso the Wise of Spain in the body of\n\nlaws called the   Siete Partidas   .\n The Spanish nobility also created social distance between itself and\n\nthe mass of Spaniards by supporting a huge dependent domestic class.\n\n\n\n  I have indicated that the fifteenth century saw the development\n\nof the nation-state in Europe, whose society gradually was emerging out of\n\nthat system of social, economic, military and political relations broadly\n\ndescribed as feudalism, the transition was not complete at the end of the\n\nfifteenth century, it is true, but the evidence points to the increasing\n\ndominance of the King and his court over the nobility.\n\n\ncoexisted with the predominance of the monarch.\n " We who are no\n\nbetter than you declare to you who are no better than us"  . \n In Castille, however, the process of Crown control was far more\n\nadvanced.\n That Crown, worn by Ferdinand\'s wife, Isabella, had no intention of\n\nallowing a new powerful nobility to arise in the so-called New World glimpsed\n\nby Christopher Columbus on the morning of October 12, 1492 at Guanahani in\n\nthe Bahamas.\n The Crown, too, would see to it that the Church never asserted its\n\ntemporal power over the Crown, and the  patronato real \n\nbecame the legal mechanism whereby the Spanish Crown controlled appointments\n\nto the Church, with due respect to the Popes who had formally granted\n\npossession of the western continents \x13 the papal donation to the Spanish\n\nCrown. \n\n  The Spaniards whose ships scoured the Caribbean Sea after 1492\n\ncame, then, in search of fortune, of status and honour, of  \n\nhidalgo   status, ideologically buttressed by the conviction\n\nthat God was on the side of the conquest.\n It may be so.\n What is certain, however, is that they had sufficient gun-power, the\n\nmanoeuverability of a cavalry, and a belief in total war to crush a native\n\nenemy whose most advanced weapons were spears.\n The Jamaican Indians threw their spears at Columbus\'s ships, to no\n\navail. \n\n \n\n During his second voyage to the Indies Columbus mentions thick\n\nsettlements of Indians on the Jamaican north and south coast.\n The Dominican friar, Bartolome de las Casas, referred later on to the\n\nvery dense Indian population of Jamaica, and from all appearances Las Casas\n\nobtained this information from people who had visited Jamaica.\n The recent works of Sherbourne Cooke and Woodrow Borah? have tended\n\nto revise upward the Indian populations of the Caribbean and central America\n\nsuggesting up to one and a half million for Hispaniola \x13 substantial revision\n\nupwards from 60,000 to 600,000. Morales Padron suggests 60,000 native\n\nJamaicans, but  figure seems to have been plucked\n\narbitrarily out of his own hat. \n\n  We are not in a position to give an accurate figure either.\n It is interesting to note, however, that when in 1511, Indians were\n\nbeing shared out among the Spaniards in   repartimiento \n\n , that the Crown received a large number and the Columbus family\n\n1,600  men  and his Lieutenant another 1,600.\n These figures must surely correspond to the perception of the Spanish\n\ncolonists of the size of the Indian population.\n There are unfortunately no figures on how many Indians were granted\n\nto less deserving Spaniards, and no figures either on how many Spaniards were\n\nin Jamaica.\n It is worth noting too that this distribution of Indians took place\n\nfourteen years after Columbus\'s first entry into the island, and we can\n\nassume that the decline of the population had begun long before 1511. \n\n By the end of the sixteenth century most of the Indian population had\n\ndied.\n There are three major explanations for the rapid decline of the\n\npopulations of the Americas.\n The first one was suggested by Bartolome de las Casas \x13 that the\n\nsystem was primarily responsible.\n\n\n imposed such a harsh labour regime on the Indians that they were\n\nunable to survive it.\n ( It has been argued that the European labour system imposed the\n\ncapitalist category of labour organisation on a system that had been\n\nprimarily communal).\n The fact is that the Spanish authorities in Jamaica were instructed\n\nto intensify production in Jamaica in order to meet the needs of the\n\n  conquistadores   on their way to the mainland \x13\n\nbred supplies, cattle or whatever the island could provide.\n Jamaica, strategically placed vis-a-vis the Mainland, was ideal for\n\nthe performance of that function.\n The island served as a supply base for Castillo del Oro, sent\n\nmaterial assistance to Pedrarias on the Isthmus, and to Vasco Nunez de\n\nBalboa.\n We know that the governor of Jamaica sent to Balboa cassava bread,\n\npork, beef and other supplies, which incidentally Balboa never paid for.\n The King recommended that Jamaicans sign up with Gil Gonzalez Davila\n\nfor the exploration of the South Sea, since the Jamaicans were already\n\nacclimatized.\n Garay one of Jamaica\'s first governors eventually joined Heran\n\nCortes.\n as\n\n  head of an expedition for the Mainland.\n ( Morales, 70-5), Las Casas does have a point, though the labour\n\nregime was not entirely responsible for the destruction of the Indian\n\npopulation. \n\n  A second factor was the export of Jamaican Indians to Cuba to\n\nfill the gap left by the declining Indian population in that island.\n Again, there are no specific statistics.\n A third possibility is war between the Indians and Spaniards.\n It is clear that many Indians fled to the less accessible mountains\n\naway from the Spaniards.\n but no details are\n\ngiven.\n We do know that the Spanish colonists did resort to brutal tactics to\n\nkeep the Indian population in subjection.\n\n\nRepartidor de Indios  , Garay was much struck by the sparsity of\n\nthe Indian Population.\n In 1515 Pedro de Mazuelo concluded that if Spanish excesses were\n\nallowed to continue that the entire Indian population would be erased within\n\ntwo years. \n " When Diego Columbus\'s representative tried to distribute\n\nthe Indians, the Caciques openly resisted, and the Indians began to flee for\n\nrefuge in the highest mountains.\n of the leaders was followed by the\n\nsubmission of the rest, who were immediately distributed and used as\n\nagricultural labourers." ( Morales Padron 260-1).\n In 1523, one Francisco Garcia Bermejo informed the King that in the\n\nfirst  repartimiento  of Indians, the Cacique Goayrabo,\n\nand all his subjects has been assigned to him; but at the time of writing he\n\nhad only four or five Indians left.  ( Morales: 185) \n\n  By far the most important cause of Indian mortality was disease.\n The most fatal of all diseases brought to the New World was\n\nsmall-pox, described by Alfred Crosby as a  " disease with seven\n\nleague boots."  ( 201) The disease appeared in Espanola ( Hispaniola)\n\n  " at the end of 1518 or the beginning of 1519...the malady\n\nquickly exter<l>minated a third or half of the Arawacks on Espanola, and\n\nalmost immediately leaped the straits to Puerto Rico and the other Greater\n\nAntilles, accomplishing the same devastation there." ( 200)\n\n\ntheria, trschoma, whooping cough, chicken pox, bubonic plague, malaria,\n\ntyphoid fever, cholera, yellow fever, dengue fever, amebic dysentery, and\n\nother  " helminthic infestations."  ( Crosby: 198)\n susceptibility of the non-immune\n\nArawaks to the new diseases was quickly demonstrated when Columbus \n\n " searching for a West Indian commodity that would sell in Europe,\n\nsent 550 Amerindian slaves, twelve to thirty-five years of age, more or less,\n\noff across the Atlantic.\n Two hundred died on the difficult voyage; 350 survived to be put to\n\nwork in Spain. The majority of these soon were also dead  because\n\nthe land did not suit them." ( Crosby:198) \n\n  The affection that the rat has always had for man has never\n\nreally been shared by man whose abhorrence for the rodent has been\n\nintensified by the plagues and the diseases that it carries.\n " shipped as stowaways with the\n\nIberians everywhere they went in America." \n " They bred in infinite\n\nnumbers, overran the land, and destroyed crops and standing plants, such as\n\nfruit trees, by gnawing the bark from the ground to the shoots."\n\nAfterward they remained in such numbers on the coast  " that no cat\n\ndare look them in the face." \n We can assume that the rat performed its function equally\n\nefficiently in Jamaica \x13 destroying fruits, and spreading murine typhus. \n\n  encomienda\n\n  , even for the introduction of African slaves, whom he\n\nassumed would be better able to cope with hard labour.\n The use of African labour, as we have noted was widespread in the\n\nIberian peninsula, and it was natural for las Casas to think in terms of\n\nextending African slavery to the Americas.\n The Africans faced the same demographic catastrophe.\n African slaves were introduced into Hispaniola from about 1520, and\n\ncertainly by the mid- sixteenth century Jamaicans were pleading for the\n\nintroduction of African slaves.\n The assumption \x13 no African labour, no prosperity, and a King after\n\nall could not be wealthy if his subjects were poor.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '7b938672-953b-4e36-ae98-683d621e3212', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.330201+00:00', 'english_score': 0.966924786567688, 'non_english_score': 0.03307521343231201}

been\n\nignored or swept under the carpet of the Indian-Spanish weave.\n And yet, for almost the entire colonial period, there were more\n\nAfricans in Mexico than Europeans.  \n La poblaci&oacute;n\n\nnegra de México   ( México: Fondo de Cultural\n\nEcon&oacute;mica, 1984), 234. \n When to this is added, under the entire colonial period, the\n\nincreasing number of Mestizos \x13 whether Afro- European or Afro-Indian \x13 the\n\nAfrican presence in Mexico has had a significant impact demographically. \n\n \n\nopen up a massive panorama of an African presence and influence centuries\n\nbefore Cortes arrived in Mexico. \n 2 Notably van Sertima ( 1976) and José Luis Melgarejo Vivanco,\n\n  Breve historia de Veracruz   ( Xalapa: Edta del\n\nGobierno de Veracruz, 1975). \n It was mainly centred on the Olmec culture in the Gulf coast region\n\nuntil its subsequent expansion and influence through areas of\n\npresent-day Veracruz, Puebla and Guerrero states \x13 coincidentally, some of\n\nthe very states in which post-conquest Africans were to be located ( Fig.\n\n6.1).\n Virtually all the Africans arriving in Mexico in the colonial\n\nperiod were brought as slaves to work, not only on the sugar estates being\n\nestablished in Veracruz, but also in other branches of agriculture, in\n\ndomestic work, in the gold and silver mines and in various aspects of urban\n\nindustry.\n As a result, in addition to the regions mentioned above, Africans\n\nbecame located in most of the central highlands around Mexico City,\n\nstretching as far north as the mines of Guanajuato and Zacatecas, west to\n\nTaxco and Acapulco and south to Chiapas. \n\n  In the sixteenth century, the majority of Africans came from the\n\nCape Verde area and West Africa in general, but by the seventeenth century,\n\nthe main areas   of provenance had shifted to\n\nthe Congo and Angola.  \n\n Because of the shortage of African women, relationships soon\n\ndeveloped with Indians.\n Similarly, Spaniards developed relationships with African slaves\n\nand the whole process of this racial mixing expanded inexorably.\n Five hundred years have produced a decidedly, if not always\n\nadmittedly, mixed population in much of the areas mentioned above. \n\n \n\n  As happened throughout the Americas, the slaves did not take\n\npassively to their enslavement.\n A variety of forms of resistance rapidly developed, including rebel\n\n<l> lion and maronage.\n In an exceptional reference to the Maroon\'s own historical sources,\n\narchival documents of 1767 quoted one Maroon leader thus, concerning the\n\nexistence of  palenques  : \n " According to what the old folks tell us, they have always\n\nbeen there since the conquest of this country".  \n Esclavos negros en las haciendas\n\nazucareras de C&oacute;rdoba, Veracruz, 1690-1830   ( Xalapa:\n\nUniversidad Vercruzana, 1987), 129.  \n\n  Within three years of the fall of the Aztec empire, reference\n\nwas being made to African slaves who had fled to live among the Zapotec\n\nIndians.  \n Los vagabundos en la Nueva\n\nEspa&ntilde;a: Siglo XVI   ( México: Edit Jus, 1957),\n\n120. \n For generations, there were complaints of Maroons attacking and\n\nrobbing travellers on the Veracruz-Mexico highway.\n In 1576, blacks and mulattoes who had established themselves in a\n\nplace called Ca&ntilde;ada de Negros, carried out numerous attacks against\n\nthe Spaniards of the newly-established town of Leon.\n " insolences"\n\n .\n When the Spaniards tried to capture or control them, they simply\n\nfled beyond the jurisdictional limits of Leon. \n\n\n\n It was established that by 1570, fully one-tenth of the black\n\npopulation ( which then totalled about 20,000) had fled.  \n\n\n  It was calculated, also, that in 1609 there were some 500\n\nrunaways in the Orizaba area between Puebla and Veracruz.  \n\n Data for the sugar estate near Cuernavaca belonging to the\n\nMarquis del Valle, indicate that the incidence of maronage in the area\n\nincreased in the eighteenth century, one cause being that there were now more\n\nmulatto slaves who could more easily disappear amidst the now sizeable free\n\nmulatto/Mestizo population.  \n La hacienda azucarera de los\n\nmarqueses del Valle ( 1535-1910)   ( México: Siglo XXI,\n\n1977), 195.  \n\n \n\n  If the circumstances and location of runaways were varied, so\n\ntoo were the lifestyles resulting from maronage.\n There were isolated runaways, many of whom sought to lose themselves\n\nin towns or areas of free coloureds or Indians.\n There were many others, who joined together ( or with other racial\n\ngroups) in gangs of vagabonds and bandits, living off the proceeds of robbery\n\nand general pillage, while operating mainly along main roadways.  \n , 95.\n\n \n\n  palenques\n\n or communities, especially, though not always, in the mountains,\n\nsuch as the Sierra de Zongolica, Veracruz, or the Sierras de Guerrero.\n While many of these communities developed an agricultural lifestyle,\n\nothers supplemented their farming activities with proceeds from robbing the\n\ncolonists. \n\n  Equally varied was the relationship between Maroons and other\n\nsocial groups.\n From very early, partly because of the paucity of women in their\n\ngroups and partly because the child of an Indian was born free, Africans took\n\nIndian women as their mates.\n There were repeated instances of Maroons seizing Indian women, as\n\nfor example, in 1609 when the Maroons of Yanga raided a ranch and took off\n\nwith six Indian women.  \n " La lucha de los negros\n\nesclavos en las haciendas azucareras de C&oacute;rdoba en el siglo XV\n\n  ,  Anuario II  , Centro de Estudios\n\nHist&oacute;ricos, Universidad Veracruzana ( 1980): 80. \n Speaking of the townships of Colatlan set up with Tlaxcalan Indians,\n\ncolonial documents explain how mulattoes arrived in search of freedom, and\n\nthe Indians themselves sheltered them.\n After a few years they either married Indian women or claimed\n\nfrontier militia rights.  \n Colotlan: Doble\n\nfrontera contra los b&aacute;rbaros   ( México: UNAM,\n\n1961), 17-18. \n Indeed, in general terms, complaints were made to Phillip II in 1574\n\nthat it was impossible to enforce the prohibition of black/Indian unions\n\nsince  " the Indian women are slack and very taken by blacks, so they\n\nprefer to marry them rather than Indian men, and just so the black men marry\n\nthem rather than black women, so as to have free children"  .  \n\n\n  The frequency of male African Maroons having Indian women is an\n\nimportant determinant of the subsequent racial, ethnic and cultural\n\nassimilation of the Maroons and their post-abolition descendants. \n\n  Such relationships with Indian communities as a whole were not\n\nalways so congenial.\n In fact, the above feature would indicate a certain amount of\n\nhostility towards blacks on the part of Indian males.\n Some Maroon communities did get on fairly well with their\n\nneighbouring Indians, usually for economic reasons,  but the majority had contradictory and sometimes hostile\n\nrelationships. \n Los pobladores del\n\nPapaliopan   ( México: Instituto Nacional Indigenista,\n\npre- edici&oacute;n mimeo\n#19, 1956), 65. \n In the remote areas of the Costa Chica de Guerrero, hostility\n\ntowards Indians was general among the mixed Maroon/free Afro- mestizos, who\n\nusurped their lands and livelihood, and abused them constantly.  \n Cuijla: esbozo\n\netnogr&aacute;fico de un pueblo negro   ( México: Fondo\n\nde Cultura Econ&oacute;mica, 1958), 87. \n While the majority of Spanish colonists were antagonistic to\n\nand fearful of the Maroons, some found them a useful source of paid man <l>\n\npower or traded profitably with them.\n Indeed, one of the leading petitioners for the establishment of the\n\nfree Maroon village of Amapa in the 1760, was the chief magistrate of\n\nTeutila.\n He used the Maroons as agents in the vanilla trade and provided\n\nthem with supplies \x13 even weapons.  \n ,\n\n143.  \n\n  Among fellow blacks and mulattoes, maroons were usually well\n\nreceived.  \n " La vida de los\n\ncimarrones en Veracruz"   , in  Jornadas de homenaje a\n\nGonzalo Aguirre Beltr&aacute;n  / Veracruz: Instituto Veracruzano de\n\nCultura, 1988), 87. \n It would seem, also, that some even made regular visits to their\n\nwomen still in slavery, since one of the conditions sought by the\n\nplanters in the establishment of Amapa was that such women should be sold to\n\ntheir now free men, rather than have the latter visit them on the\n\nplantations.  \n ,\n\n147. \n However, there were also cases of betrayal of Maroons to the\n\nSpaniards by fellow Maroons or slaves \x13 usually with the bribe of freedom \x13\n\nwith disastrous results for the  palenques  in some cases.\n A law of 1574 granted freedom to runaways who handed in other\n\nrunaways.  \n Enciclopedia de\n\nMéxico. Vol. IX   ( México: Enciclopedia de\n\nMéxico, 1975), 370. \n Addi <l  <tionally, mulattoes and Afro-Indians wer e used in\n\ncampaigns against Maroons. \n\n \n\n  In trying to curb the phenomenon of maronage, the Spaniards used\n\na variety of measures, chief among which were punitive ones.\n Severe punishments were legislated against runaways, including\n\ncastration and, particularly for leaders, death.\n At times, the authorities were reluctant to return runaways to their\n\n " owners"  , and preferred to keep them imprisoned.\n In most cases, a runaway was valued at much lower than normal fees\n\nbecause of the economic risk of their repeating the act.\n\n\n  And yet, throughout the entire period of slavery, the most\n\nvirulently punitive measures proved incapable of stopping the process of\n\nmaronage.\n Other measures were equally ineffective.\n For example, the establishing of the Spanish town of C&oacute;rdoba\n\nin 1617 as a sort of garrison town along the Puebla-Veracruz highway, to\n\ncontrol maronage and slaves in the area, did not prevent them from running\n\naway and damaging colonial property.  \n El cant&oacute;n de\n\nC&oacute;rdoba.  Vol. 1  ( México: Ed Citlaltepetl,\n\n1959).  \n\n  met\n\nwith some success in the Veracruz area, but failed in the more remote\n\nand difficult terrain of Guerrero.\n But these military campaigns proved to be very expensive and also\n\ndiverted the militia members from productive work on their farms.\n The Catholic Church was trying to convince the Maroons that\n\nChristianity and pacifism were the correct paths to follow, teachings which\n\nseemed to have had some subversive effect on members of some \n\npalenques  . \n\n  Where the path of violence was inconclusive in controlling the\n\nMaroons, and partly because it was a costly and debilitating strategy, the\n\ncolonial authorities in two exceptional cases almost one hundred and fifty\n\nyears apart but within the same general region, agreed to a negotiated\n\nsettlement with Maroons although with some reluctance.\n This in the face of opposition from the planters, who feared the\n\neffect the examples of freedom from slavery would have on their slaves. \n\n  The two cases, Manga/San Lorenzo and Amapa, have been the focus\n\nof much study and comment, partly because since their creation impinged on\n\nthe state structure, documentation exists.\n Unfortunately, precisely because they represent communities of some\n\nassimilation into the dominant state, they reflect fewer African retentions\n\nthan would have been the case in the more remote and  " rebel"\n\n  palenques  which have had scant documentation.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Some confusion exists as to whether the establishment of San\n\nLorenzo in 1630 was a distinct development separate from the recognition of\n\nthe  palenqueros  , headed by the most famous African in\n\npost-Cortes Mexico: Yanga ( or Nanga).\n\n " Yanga was a fine-bodied black, from the Bran nation and of\n\nwhom it was said that were he not captured, he would have been king in his\n\ncountry; with those lofty ideas he had been leader of the rebellion from some\n\nthirty years, in which his authority and fine style towards those of his\n\ncolour had consid<l>erably increased his followings".  \n " Dos aspectos\n\nde la esclavitud negra en Veracruz"   , in  Jornadas de\n\nhomenaje  , 221.  \n\n  located in the\n\nZongolica range near Orizaba were the most threatening to the colonists.\n The data indicate that by then, because of his age, Yanga kept the\n\ncivil and political authority for himself, but entrusted the military\n\nleadership to an Angolan, Francisco de la Matosa. \n\n\n\n Most of the historians base their views of this period on the\n\ntestimony of the above- mentioned Jesuit priest, Laurencio, to the effect\n\nthat in 1609 a force of some 600 men comprising Spaniards, Indians, mulattoes\n\nand Mestizos was sent against Yanga. \n\n Yanga is said to have captured a Spaniard and sent him to the leader of\n\nthis expedition, Gonzalez de Herrera, with a letter to the effect that\n\nthe Maroons \n\n    had withdrawn to that area to free themselves from the\n\ncruelty and the perfidy of the Spaniards, who without any right sought to be\n\nmasters of their liberty; that in attacking the  places and\n\nplantations, they were doing nought but compensating themselves by force of\n\narms for what was unjustly denied them and that they [ the Spaniards] should\n\nnot think of peace but should come and test forces with them.\n And, so that he [ Gonzalez] could not in cowardice claim ignorance\n\nof the path, he was sending him a bearer whom he had chosen not to kill so\n\nthat he could serve as a guide and save the job of seeking them\n\nout.  \n\n\n  This message was clear and indicated the determination of the\n\nMaroons to maintain their freedom by any means available to them. \n\n \n\n  In the face of such defiance, the Spaniards attacked and\n\nmanaged to defeat the Maroons, who withdrew from that  palenque\n\n into others situated in more difficult terrain to continue in\n\nfreedom.\n Laurencio\'s description of what the Spaniards found in the\n\n palenque  gives a glimpse of the sedentary agricultural\n\nlife that the Maroons sought to establish even as they were on a constant\n\nwar- footing.   " Provision grounds of corn, tobacco, pumpkin,\n\nbanana and other fruit trees,&dotted-line; beans, sweet potato,\n\nvegetables&dotted-line; an abundance of chickens and a large number of\n\ncattle&dotted-line; as well as about sixty huts that sheltered approximately\n\neighty adult males, twenty-four black and Indian women and an indeterminate\n\nnumber of children".  \n\n\n \n\n  The historians all agree that Maroon activity and resistance\n\npersisted in the area until the Viceroy agreed in 1630, to the establishment\n\nof a free town of Maroons.\n\n\n 25   ascribe to Yanga after the defeat described above, a\n\nproposal for a peace treaty. \n 126;\n\nHerrera,  El cant&oacute;n  , 96-97.\n However, Aguirre has quoted documents of 1608 ( corroborated by\n\nGarc&iacute;a Bustamante) that set out Yanga\'s peace proposals, the most\n\nfundamental being that Yanga be governor and after him his children and their\n\ndescendants.\n Another condition was that Franciscan friars and no others\n\nwere to administer the area.  \n " Nyanga y la\n\ncontroversia en torno a su reducci&oacute;n a pueblo"   , in\n\n Jornada de homenaje,  133-32.  \n\n  Naveda lists other demands: that all slaves who had fled before\n\n1608 remain free, that no Spaniard live in their community and that they have\n\ntheir own  cabildo  .\n They also offered to pay tribute and to hand over any slave who ran\n\naway.   27 Naveda,  Esclavos negros,\n\n , 126.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '92851925-260e-42ee-a06a-291e4413aac0', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.331576+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9618722796440125, 'non_english_score': 0.03812772035598755}

she not only laments but resents her banishment to\n\n wraecsipa  ,  " the paths of exile." \n This single view of woman\'s outlawry contrasts with other views of\n\nexile in Old English because of one factor which distinguishes the relation\n\n<l> ship between woman and lord/husband from that between retainer and\n\nlord.\n The Wife\'s passion rages on, unabated by events but distorted from\n\nsweetness to bitterness.\n In the finality of her husband\'s desertion, her love turns to hatred\n\nand her grief to fury.\n The outer landscape reflects the inner.\n Her dwelling place is among dim recesses overgrown with thorns.\n ) of the self\n\nand ends in contemplation of her husband\'s isolation,  waetre beflowen.\n\n \n\n \n\nmakes limited overt reference to the sea.\n Yet the presence of the sea is implied in the novel\'s themes of\n\njourney, exile, and maroonage and is essential to the tale of Antoinette\'s\n\ndispossession, which involves her actual transshipment to England.\n Rochester\'s Eurocentric vision of civilization redefines all that\n\nAntoinette would consider civilized as savage, yet he transports her to an\n\nattic that is neither civilization nor wilderness.\n The casting of Rochester as conqueror/colonizer implies his own\n\nvoyage of adventure.\n Metaphorically too the confining sea is implicit in all\n\nsuggestions of insularity that support the theme of Antoinette\'s increasing\n\nisolation and eventual imprisonment.\n Like the Old English world, Caribbean society itself is insular,\n\nwaterlocked.\n The sea divides, and it defines borders of existence.\n " paths of\n\nexile."  \n\n Although Nebecker examines development as journey, she does not pursue a\n\nlink between transshipment and abortive birth.\n Her physical voyage completes her psychological passage of\n\ndispossession and finalizes her deprivation of mother, mother-land, and\n\nmother-tongue.\n Separate from society, and indeed never fully part of any\n\ncivilization, Antoinette\'s quest is for existence and identity.\n The actual account of her physical passage across the Atlantic\n\noccupies less than a paragraph, but her psychological journey \x13 a study of\n\nemotional darkness, isolation, and confinement in which Antoinette\n\nbattles for existence \x13 constitutes the entire novel. \n\n  Elsewhere in Caribbean literature the Middle Passage has\n\nfiguratively associated the sea with childbirth.\n In comparing the trauma of transshipment to that of birth, the\n\nnarrative may focus on the tortured consciousness of either mother or child.\n The link between passage in the great triangular route of the slave\n\ntrade and passage in the birth canal occurs in John Hearne\'s  Sure\n\nSalvation  , where the frustrated womb of Eliza Hogarth reflects the\n\nbecalmed slave ship.\n The passage of Eliza\'s nightmare labour brings death and madness.\n in many senses, self-\n\ncondemned to isolation in her sterile cabin.\n Close at hand the hold confines a cargo of slaves, until the whole\n\nenterprise is violently aborted.\n\n\nexplicitly links the birth struggle and sea passage in ways that recall the\n\nend of  Wide Sargasso Sea  :  \n\n\n the movement down\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  and begin another\n\n  By a combination of such metaphors Rhys explores the mind of a\n\nCaribbean woman adrift in a murky passage between her Caribbean beginnings\n\nand an attic in Britain.\n Antoinette tries to smash her way out of confinement in the cabin,\n\nbut her captors drug her into sleep: \n " It was that night, I think, that we changed course and\n\nlost our way to England&dotted-line;.\n\n\n ( 148).\n Torn from her motherland, Antoinette never arrives at the\n\ncivilization she has imagined. \n\n Rochester\'s preconceived vision of her aborts her independent existence.\n Rhys approaches the Passage as a psychological voyage of the white\n\nnigger/bartered woman in a study of the identity crisis through\n\ntransportation from the Caribbean to England.\n It is an unnatural separation, abortive rather than maturing to\n\nindependent identity; her passage is a miscarriage.\n\n\nground to the mad wife of Rochester in  Jane Eyre. \n is thus a journey through recollection\n\nby the  " madwoman"  in the attic, a woman whose development\n\nof an identity separate from her mother has been stunted.\n Kloepfer analyses the mother/daughter relationship in detail, but\n\ndoes not explore the methods by which Rhys fragments time, setting, and point\n\nof view to support the controlling theme of this tortured and disori <l>\n\nented psyche, stripped of its every support and suspended in a timeless void.\n\n\n\n \n\nence to birth trauma or to a mother/daughter relationship ( although the Wife\n\nrefers to earlier sorrows).\n sufferings show\n\nmuch in common.\n In the exile imposed by her husband, the Wife shares with Antoinette/\n\n " Bertha"  a history of irrevocable loss and a present of\n\nunremitting yearning.\n\n\n  Both narrators, dislocated in space, produce accounts which are\n\nsuperficially sequential but embedded in frames that are dechronologized.\n When the Old English Wife mentions her lord\'s departure overseas this\n\nmay or may not be of his own volition, may or may not be desertion, may or\n\nmay not precede emotional estrangement.\n care,\n\nwhich may imply sudden discovery of his absence at daybreak or the end\n\nof innumerable sleepless nights.\n In an age of limited communication, a wife may well lose track of the\n\nexact location of a husband travelling abroad, but in  The Wife\'s Lament\n\n the narrator\'s reaction does not suggest routine uncertainty, for her\n\nhusband\'s departure from his people renders her friendless and impels her to\n\njourney in search of support.\n of the kinsmen, introduced\n\nat this point, does not necessarily follow her departure into friendlessness\n\nchronologically;

{'text': "Middle Class Domination, External Dependency, and\n\nInternal Clientelism, 1962-1972   \n\n  This chapter analyzes the linkages between the interests of inter\n\n<l> national actors and the noncapitalist state-controlling middle class.\n The Colonial Development and Welfare Act of 1940 legitimized both\n\nstatist expansion for welfare purposes and lower-class mobilization into\n\nlabor and party organizations.\n State expansion gave the middle class tremendous access to the\n\nresources needed to finance its clientelistic structure of power maintenance\n\n( see Chapter 2).\n That structure has been largely maintained by extracting resources\n\nfrom international capitalist actors.\n The latter includes international business, international\n\norganizations, international financial agencies, foreign governments, and\n\ninternational sectors within the local economy. \n\n  The terms and conditions of the relationship between these inter\n\n<l> national actors and the middle class were determined by the latter's\n\nwillingness to maintain the existing structures of international depen <l>\n\ndency.\n Both JLP and PNP governments of the 1950- 1972 period gave foreign\n\ncapital the most favourable economic conditions possible to pursue its\n\ninterests ( see Chapter 2).\n Additionally, international actors were protected from the\n\nsociopolitical crises of potential private-sector mobilization and\n\nlower-class rebellions.\n The state mediated class conflicts in the domestic economy to ensure\n\ncontinued middle-class access to external resources.\n External resources were used to constrict and restrict the power of\n\nthe domestic capitalist class and simultaneously demobilized the lower class\n\nthrough clientelism, intimidation, and violence.\n The interests of the middle class, the domestic capitalist class, and\n\ninternational capitalist actors converged in the 1962-1972 postinde <l>\n\npendence Jamaican political economy.\n As all these interests were mediated by the state, it became very\n\npowerful relative to other domestic actors and had room to maneuver in its\n\nrelationship with international actors.  \n For the past two decades, debate among radical neo-Marxists has\n\nfocused on the  \x1crelative autonomy\x1c  of the postcolonial\n\nstate.\n Some argue that the postcolonial state cannot be independent of\n\nforeign interests and cannot therefore be used in the interests of the nation\n\ninvolved.\n \x1crelatively autonomous\x1c\n\n with some power to set limits to the power of foreign capital and\n\nbargain with it.\n The first coherent advocate of this position was Hamza Alavi ( 1972).\n Dozens of articles have been written on the subject.\n For example, see Leys ( 1976), Von Freyhold ( 1977), Shivji ( 1976),\n\nand Stone ( 1977a).  \n\n \n\n \n\n  Foreign ownership of business in the postindependence period in\n\ndeveloping nations has become an issue of growing sensitivity.\n In many instances, foreign companies were allowed to purchase\n\ncontrolling interests in key industries without giving domestic purchasers\n\nsome type of preference.\n Insofar as acquisitions were concerned, the local private sector was\n\nat an economic disadvantage vis-&agrave;-vis their foreign competitors in the\n\narea of tax treatment, technology, skilled personnel, and capital resources.\n The dominant view within Jamaica was that foreign direct investment\n\nwas desirable.\n Foreign control, on the scale on which it took place during the\n\n1950-1967 period, was inimical to the national interest as it involved\n\nselling permanent assets and created a foreign claim on the Jamaican economy.\n Backed by the emerging capitalist classes, the political leaders made\n\na decision to allow unlimited foreign control of strategic domestic\n\nindustries.\n This decision appeared to have been based on Jamaica's overdependence\n\non foreign capital and the political  fear of frightening\n\nthat capital away. \n\n  Perhaps the most significant economic event in the postwar period\n\nwas the arrival of North American-based TNCs in the bauxite, tourist, and\n\nmanufacturing industries.\n Demand for aluminium had been stimulated by the Korean War and the\n\nspace exploration program.\n Companies participating included Aluminium Company of America (\n\nALCOA), Aluminium Company of Canada ( ALCAN), Kaiser, and Reynolds.\n Massive inflows of capital also led to the establishment of\n\nbranch-plant manufacturing.\n Many TNCs set up manufacturing subsidiaries in Jamaica, often in\n\njoint ventures with the state or the local private sector.\n Familiar names such as Firestone, Exxon, Colgate Palmolive, and Del\n\nMonte set up alongside existing British companies, such as Bata Shoes, which\n\nchose to remain.\n Sheraton, Hilton, among others, scrambled control of the hotel\n\nindustry.\n First National City Bank, First Chicago, and Citizen's Bank arrived\n\nin the same period to join Barclays, Bank of Nova Scotia, and Royal Bank of\n\nCanada \x13 British and Canadian banks that had been around for a long time.\n\n\n\n  Transnational corporate capital was invited into the Caribbean\n\nbecause the needs of the state-controllers and the foreign investors\n\ncoincided.\n The former was committed to capitalist accumulation and the latter\n\nwas interested in accumulation in the form of access to the resources of the\n\nstate.\n The middle class's desire to expand the state sector and the TNC's\n\ninterests in gaining cheap labor and making huge profits coincided to create\n\nthe basis for alliance. \n\n  Underlying these seemingly apparent common interests are two\n\ncontradictory interests.\n First, the TNC bourgeoisie wanted to bring its technology, skills,\n\nand expertise to Jamaica in exchange for cheap labor and an increase in its\n\nglobal profits.\n Second, the Jamaican middle-class rulers desired state resources to\n\nsatisfy developmental functions and to employ state control of the economy to\n\nmaintain dominance over other social classes.\n On the surface, these two goals do not appear contradictory.\n The contradiction lies in the structure of the exchange relationship\n\nbetween the TNCs and the political directorate whereby TNCs not only\n\nexpropriate surpluses created in developing nations, but also eliminate\n\npotential bases for local capital accumulation through the international\n\npolitical and economic structures they monopolize and control ( Girvan 1978).\n The global interests of the TNCs were often in conflict with the\n\npolitical interests of the state in developing nations.  \n For different perspectives on the bauxite TNCs in Jamaica, see Stone\n\n( 1977a), Stephens and Stephens ( 1985), and Manley ( 1987).  To\n\nhead off conflict, the Jamaican political elite accepted the terms dictated\n\nby the bauxite TNCs, as it feared that retaliation could lead to withdrawal\n\nof investments. \n\n \n\n  Capital investments made by the four largest North American\n\nbauxite companies \x13 Kaiser, Reynolds, ALCAN, and ALCOA \x13 have been the\n\nlargest single source of investment and capital flow into the postwar\n\neconomy.\n This import of capital was accompanied by the purchasing of more than\n\n600,000 acres of Jamaican farmland to carry out bauxite mining.\n The aluminium industry quickly grew to one of the wealthiest\n\ninternational industries and became the largest export industry in Jamaica,\n\naccounting for 47 percent of its exports in 1968 ( Girvan 1971a; Jefferson\n\n1972) and one-tenth of its GDP.\n Bauxite TNCs controlled 100 percent of Jamaican bauxite alumina\n\nproduction and were the largest single source of taxes paid to the Jamaican\n\ngovernment. \n\n  The U.S. government made a decision after World War II that\n\nnational reserves of strategic minerals should be stockpiled.\n With the decision to depend on imported bauxite, U.S. aluminium\n\ncompanies turned their attention to Jamaica. The island soon became a key\n\nlink in the  strategy to internationalize their\n\noperations, and became the major supplier of bauxite to North America. \n\n  Labor was cheap and abundant in Jamaica.\n In 1953, the unskilled bauxite worker earned an average of about 13\n\npounds a week, just slightly more than the sugar cane cutter working\n\nfull-time during the harvest ( Manley 1975:115).\n Because there was relatively little skilled labor in Jamaica, the\n\ncompanies could control the training and set wage scales for skilled workers.\n But worker militancy soon forced the companies to raise wages well\n\nabove the Jamaican average.\n The companies still had an economic advantage, however, as even with\n\nthe wage increases they were paying the bauxite workers in Canada and the\n\nUnited States significantly more than their Jamaican counterparts.\n At that time there was not a single union specifically for Jamaican\n\nbauxite workers. \n\n  During the period between World War II and 1972, the aluminium\n\ncompanies dominated the bargaining situation in Jamaica ( Huggins 1965).\n The strength of the companies was fortified by the existence of many\n\nenterprises in the extraction of bauxite and the production of alumina.\n Agreements linking Kaiser with Reynolds, Pechiney with Kaiser,\n\nAlusuisse with Pechiney, and other such pairing characterized the structure\n\nof the aluminium industry. \n\n  From the point of view of the bauxite TNCs, Jamaica gained\n\ntechnological and managerial skills, much needed capital, government\n\nrevenues, and foreign exchange.\n The problem was that the bauxite industry was capital intensive,\n\nwhich meant high labor productivity and hence a high demand for skilled\n\npersonnel.\n The bauxite industry employed approximately 1 percent of the Jamaican\n\nlabor force in 1976 \x13 approximately 6,000 workers out of a total employed\n\nlabor force of 883,600 ( Department of Statistics 1976:15).\n At the level of the highly skilled occupations, the industry imported\n\nits own expatriate staff.\n Thus it displaced more agricultural labor than it employed because\n\nthe costs of extracting the ore was extremely low relative to the price\n\nreceived for the final product. \n\n  \x1cdrop in the\n\nbucket\x1c  in comparison to the billions of dollars of profits returned\n\nfrom the Jamaican subsidiaries.\n In 1968, the Jamaican government received 18 percent of its tax\n\nrevenues from the bauxite industry.\n In the same year, taxation was based on a price of J$7.50 per ton,\n\nwhereas the U.S. companies reported a value of US$15.00 per ton ( 1J$ =\n\nUS$1.10) to U.S. customs authorities (  Jamaica Bauxite Institute Digest\n\n 1, 3 ( 1976):16).\n The companies consistently undervalued the price of Jamaican ore,\n\nwhich lowered their tax payments to the government.\n The government could have developed fiscal policies to combat this\n\nproblem, but it opted to acquiesce to TNC demands, as it feared retaliation\n\nthat would cripple an economy experiencing incipient industrialization. \n\n  National policy during the period was geared toward satisfying\n\nthe claims of the TNCs while hoping to secure enough revenues for the\n\nstate-controlling elite to exercise control and maintain its dominance over\n\nother social groups.\n The state opted for a strategy of cooperation and conciliation.\n Its acquiescence was based on its perception that any negative action\n\non its part might lead to a severe economic crisis because Jamaica had now\n\nbecome dependent on bauxite exports. \n\n  Jamaica's bauxite was important to North America only in the\n\nshort run, as alternate sources could be found ( although initially\n\ninconvenient and expensive) in Brazil, Guinea, and Australia.\n Jamaica's ore was not as unique as the calcined ore found in Guyana,\n\nnor was Jamaica as central to the global operations of the TNCs as was\n\nGuyanese bauxite to ALCAN.\n The political climate within Jamaica was one focused on political\n\nsovereignty and independence from Britain.\n Economic nationalism was not yet a salient issue in local politics.\n Furthermore, because the economy was experiencing unprecedented\n\ngrowth, the middle classes were expanding and the government appeared to have\n\nsufficient revenues for clientelist patronage to the poor.\n The government was not yet pushed to seek additional revenues to\n\naccommodate the disenchanted and disaffected classes.\n The state had the option to pursue a policy of conciliation and\n\ncollaboration with the TNCs. \n\n  In an alliance with the emerging local capitalist classes,\n\nsuccessive PNP and JLP governments passed legislation ( e.g., the Bauxite and\n\nAluminium Industries Encouragement Law), granting incentives to foreign\n\ninvestors as well as to local private capital.\n Governmental power was used to stimulate industrial growth with the\n\nformation of state agencies such as the Jamaica Industrial Development\n\nCorporation ( JIDC), whereby foreign investors, the local private sector, and\n\nthe state were all actively involved in economic policymaking. \n\n  Bauxite industry directors were placed on various advisory boards\n\nand government committees, as the political directorate had very little\n\nknowledge of the industry.\n The politicians relied exclusively on the information given to them\n\nby the officials of the aluminium industry, although there were competing\n\ninformation sources available to them among economists at the University of\n\nthe West Indies.\n This close relationship between the political leaders of both JLP and\n\nPNP governments and the bauxite companies ensured the latter's dominance in\n\nmatters of bauxite policy during the 1950-1972 period. \n\n  If a developing nation produces a strategic proportion of a\n\ncommodity, in whose absence from the international community crisis is sure\n\nto ensue, then that nation is in a position to exercise leverage\n\nvis-&agrave;-vis powerful TNCs.\n In 1971, the Guyanese Peoples National Congress was able to dictate\n\nthe terms of the bauxite  involvement in its economy.\n This was successfully done because at the time Guyana produced 80\n\npercent of the world's calcined bauxite, and it had the management and\n\norganizational resources required to run its nationalized operations (\n\nHintzen 1989).", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '9edd85ab-e194-4d56-8e69-aca1ac2359c4', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.334725+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': 'Jamaica is the largest of the English-speaking and the third larg\n\n<l> est island in the Caribbean.\n Its two closest neighbors, Cuba and Hispaniola, are the only two\n\nislands that are larger.\n The island lies just over 600 miles southeast of Florida, one of its\n\nclosest English-speaking neighbors.\n An extremely mountainous country, over half of Jamaica\'s 2.5 million\n\ncitizens are urban dwellers.\n\n\nboring parish St. Catherine, comprise the metropolitan hub of the country\n\nwith almost one million inhabitants. \n\n  Jamaica\'s second largest city, Montego Bay is located on the\n\nNorthwestern part of the island, 120 miles from the Kingston Metropolitan\n\nRegion ( KMR).\n It is the country\'s tourist capital and has a population of\n\napproximately 150,000.\n Served by two international airports, Jamaica is just over an\n\nhour\'s flight from Miami.\n It is, however, over three hours direct flying time from Guyana its\n\nfarthest Caribbean Community ( CARICOM) neighbor on the South American\n\nmainland. \n\n  A former slave plantation society, a majority of Jamaicans are of\n\nAfrican descent with small ethnic minorities of whites, ( East) Indians and\n\nChinese.\n Officially, the Jamaican government considers the nation a\n\nmulti-racial society.\n Notwithstanding, as in most of the former British colonies of the\n\nWest Indies, Jamaica has what could be described as a fairly rigid class\n\nstructure.\n Whites and browns occupy the top of the social hierarchy, people of\n\nmixed heritage the middle and black persons the lower rungs.  \n ( New\n\nBrunswick, NJ: Transaction Books, 1986)  \n\n  In August 1962, Jamaica became the first CARICOM country to gain\n\nits political independence from England after over three hundred years of\n\ncolonization.\n While Jamaica still relies heavily on export agriculture, its major\n\nforeign exchange revenue earner today is tourism, with earnings from bauxite,\n\nalumina and manufacturing also making significant contributions.\n Until the slump in the world aluminum market in the early 1980s,\n\nagriculture, bauxite and alumina industries were the major foreign exchange\n\nearners of the country. \n\n  One of Jamaica\'s chief colonial legacies has been its parliamen\n\n<l> tary two-party government and electoral tradition.\n The seeds of political independence were sown in the late 1930s with\n\nthe formation of the island\'s first labor union, the Bustamente\n\nIndustrial Trade Union ( BITU), and its first national political party, the\n\nPeoples National Party ( PNP).\n Since universal suffrage in 1944, the country\'s electoral politics\n\nhave been dominated by the Jamaica Labor Party ( JLP)/BITU alliance and\n\nthe PNP/National Workers Union ( NWU) alliance. \n\n \n\nitics until 1974 when the then PNP government, led by Michael Manley,\n\ndeclared itself a democratic socialist party and government.  \n 2. The formation of a communist Workers Pary of Jamaica ( WPJ)\n\nfollowed in the wake of that transformation. \n Thus, for the remainder of the decade, Jamaican politics were\n\ncharacterized by a left-right ideological cleavage fostered largely by the\n\nstatist redistributive policies and programmes of the PNP government.\n The non-aligned foreign policy of democratic socialism also\n\nensured that Jamaica would become an arena for conflict between East-West\n\nsuperpowers; especially since Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Barbados\n\n\x13the more developed countries ( MDCs) of CARICOM had recognized Cuba\n\ndiplomatically from as early as 1973.\n That the Jamaican government under Manley had friendly relations with\n\nCuba, led to tensions with the U.S., which, geopolitically, considered the\n\nCaribbean archipelago of strategic importance to its national security.  \n\n\n\x1ehostile\x1e  are a part of the region\'s 20th Century history, ( for\n\nexample, Haiti, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic).  \n\n \n\ncided with the election of the JLP\'s Edward Seaga as Jamaica\'s Prime\n\nMinister.\n Seaga was the first head of government to visit Mr. Reagan as\n\nPresident of the United States \x13 a symbolic gesture that signaled the\n\nimportance both regimes attached to renewed relationships, following a swing\n\nof the political pendulum in Jamaica from left to right. \n\n \n\ntance to accessing U.S. markets for Jamaican goods and services.\n The Jamaican economy had declined during the Manley years as a result\n\nof a quantum leap in crude oil prices which coincided with the failed\n\nredistributive socialist policies of the regime.\n Reagan\'s 1983 Caribbean Basin Initiative was meant to open the U.S.\n\nmarket to countries of the region; in part, as a U.S. response to leftist\n\nCaribbean politics of the  as much as recognition of the\n\nideological affinity between the two new regimes. \n\n \n\ncerned the reduction of the 27% unemployment level and restoration of\n\nsocial services, which had started to decline.\n But the first priority had to be restoration of law and order, the\n\nbreakdown of which saw over 800 Jamaicans killed in interparty vio <l>\n\nlence during the prolonged 1980 election campaign. \n\n  This summary description of the political-economic environment\n\nwithin which the mass media operate in contemporary Jamaica, provides the\n\nbackdrop against which to analyze the changes which have occurred and\n\ncontinue to occur in the media since political independence was achieved over\n\na century ago. \n\n \n\n \n\n  The print media in Jamaica comprise three daily newspapers.\n Star\n\n , an afternoon tabloid, are both owned by the Gleaner Company Limited\n\nwhich also publishes  The Sunday Gleaner  ; a children\'s newspaper\n\nused in the island\'s elementary schools; and textbooks under a special\n\nagreement between the government of Jamaica ( GOJ), the Canadian\n\ngovernment and the Gleaner Company.\n is the island\'s third daily newspaper.\n This most recent journal started publication in July 1988 in\n\nbroadsheet format. \n\n  Since the mid-Eighties, a number of weekly and community\n\nnewspapers have also come into existence.\n , a bi-weekly tabloid\n\npublished in Montego Bay and serving the western section of Jamaica; The \n\nTwin City Sun  , a weekly which serves the suburban bedroom community of\n\nPortmore just outside of the island\'s capital; the  St. Catherine\n\nReporter  ;  Middlesex News  , serving Central Jamaica and \n\nThe Boulevard News  , a bi-monthly tabloid which serves communities\n\nbordering the major east-west thoroughfare bisecting Kingston.\n ,\n\ndevoted to the subjects from which it takes its name.\n This is circulated primarily in the KMR.\n is an occasionally published tabloid of the\n\nPNP and  The Voice  , an occasional tabloid of the JLP.\n Party\n\nof Jamaica ( WPJ). \n\n \n\n  Two companies control the electronic media in Jamaica: Radio\n\nJamaica Rediffusion Limited ( RJR) and the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation (\n\nJBC).\n The former was, until the mid-Seventies, owned by Rediffusion of\n\nLondon and local private interests before it became a cooperatively\n\nowned entity; the latter is government owned and controlled. \n\n  Both broadcasting companies run two radio programme services\n\nnationally, on AM and FM frequencies.\n In addition, the JBC has a regional station, Radio West, based in\n\nMontego Bay and serving the western end of the island.\n Two other regional stations - Radio Northeast and Radio Central -\n\nwere closed down by the Corporation soon after the JLP came to power in 1980.\n The island\'s only television station is owned and operated by the Ja\n\n<l> maica Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n\n \n\n  Jamaicans also have access to other media forms including cinema\n\nand satellite- transmitted television.\n The former provided a nationally popular form of entertainment\n\nuntil the mid 1970s but has since declined in importance as a result of\n\ncompeting visual entertainment media, including videocassette recorders. \n\n  A variety of local and foreign magazines are also available to\n\nthe literate Jamaican.\n , a\n\nweekly business- oriented publication intended for a general audience. \n\nJélan  is a fashion magazine of special interest to women and\n\n The Jamaican  is a quarterly family- oriented publication.\n The National Institute of Jamaica publishes the leading magazine\n\ndevoted to local culture.\n , started in 1967 by the Institute, is one\n\nof the Caribbean\'s leading publications of its kind and appears on a\n\nquarterly basis. \n\n \n\nNewsweek  ,  US News and World Report  and the  Economist\n\n are all available in the urban centers of the island.\n are also available as are\n\nthe Sunday editions of the  New York Times  and the  Miami\n\nHerald  .\n , is also\n\navailable on a monthly basis. \n\n \n\nmaica.\n These include a variety of newsletters published by both public and\n\nprivate agencies, posters, fliers, street signs and billboards.\n , especially during the general\n\nelection campaigns, graffiti has also been used by partisans to convey their\n\nmessages. \n\n \n\n  It can be deduced that, in strictly commercial market terms, the\n\nJamaica economy is able to support existing media.\n tion would further be\n\nsupported by the fact that there are at present some twenty-four advertising\n\nand public relations firms operating in Jamaica.\n Twenty-two of these are locally owned and two are local subsidiaries\n\nof international agencies.\n\n\n  The following data reveal the dynamism of the Jamaican media\n\nmarket.\n In 1974, Jamaican advertising and publicity agencies received\n\nsome J$12 million.  \n " The Mass Media of Communications and\n\nSocialist Change in Jamaica,"  in: Carl Stone and Aggrey Brown (\n\neds),  Essays on Power and Change in Jamaica  ( Kingston: Jamaica\n\nPublishing House, 1977).\n\n However, by 1987 the amount spent on commercial advertising and\n\npublicity in Jamaica had reached J$154,882,059.00 ( See Table 1).\n In other words, in constant dollar terms the advertising and\n\npublicity industry in Jamaica grew by over 410% between 1974 and 1987.\n Three hundred and thirty-three percent of this growth occurred\n\nbetween 1981 amd 1987; coincident with the economic ideological shift\n\noccurring with the ascendancy of the JLP in 1980.\n The socialist management of the economy of the 1970s gave way to an\n\nopen market approach which included liberal importation of goods and\n\nservices, deregulation and divestment as well as huge inflows of foreign\n\nexchange, courtesy of the Reagan administration. \n\n \n\nronment had direct repercussions on the role of the media in Jamaican\n\nsociety as well as on professional practices within the media fraternity.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Other external factors also had an impact on the Jamaican media\n\nand media environment, manifesting their effects from as early as the\n\nmid-1970s.\n Today, they are so well integrated as to constitute important\n\nelements of the media landscape.\n Historically, the island\'s geographic proximity to the United\n\nStates has made the   movement of people,\n\ncommodities and ideas between the two countries relatively easy.\n When therefore, videocassette recorders ( VCR) were introduced in\n\nNorth America, the Jamaican middle and upper income classes were among the\n\nfirst consumers of the new technology.\n One researcher found that between 1976 and 1980 Jamaicans had\n\npurchased approximately US$21 million worth of VCR hardware and software.\n\n \n " Satellite Television and Home Video:\n\nEconomic Implications for Jamaica," CARIMAC, unpublished MS., 1983.\n\n\n The 1987 Jamaican All-Media Survey puts the present VCR set count at\n\n151,000 which means that of the 236,087 homes with electricity in Jamaica,\n\n64% have a VCR.  \n\n\n \n\nmultaneously by the introduction of satellite-transmitted television.\n Jamaicans discovered that the signal overspill of U.S. domestic\n\nsatellites could easily be received in the island.\n As Table 2 shows, in 1987 there were 6,700 backyard ( frontyard)\n\nsatellite receiving dishes in the country; 3,722 of these located in the KMR\n\nand the remaining 2,978 scattered across the rest of the island.\n At an average price of J$30,000 ( US$5,600) the dish-owning segment\n\nof the Jamaican population is largely confined to middle and upper income\n\nclasses. \n\n \n\n  Historically, an inherited colonial tradition has determined\n\ngovernment-media relations in Jamaica.\n This tradition has influenced both articulated and latent ( but\n\nimplicit) policies of the two political parties that have formed governments\n\nsince universal suffrage in 1944.\n So for example, British laws of libel and slander and the citizens\n\nright to information, which define the parameters of free speech in\n\nEngland, are the prevailing laws within which Jamaican media operate.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'bb7f62cb-6451-4e21-b2d6-10fea95dacca', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.336155+00:00', 'english_score': 0.961662232875824, 'non_english_score': 0.038337767124176025}
{'text': ': a\n\nmetaphor for liberation   \n\n \n\n \n\n  The very title of this chapter betrays the problem of black\n\nexistence as part of the human condition in the lopsided world of today.\n The notion of black aesthetics, as against a supposedly white\n\naesthetics, comes out of the conceptual configurations of a white world\n\nthat is used to conquest, domination, and superordinate status with\n\nEurope as Conqueror, Overlord and Mother Superior while the rest remain at\n\nthe bottom of a power pyramid on the basis of certain laws of nature and the\n\nLaw of God. \n\n  The idea of black aesthetics is very much a European invention,\n\npart of a power- apparatus devised to keep large masses of humanity in\n\nsubjugation and to deny to them any innate sense of order, interior\n\nlogic or consistency in all the varied acts of intelligence that are the\n\nproduct of the collective or individual intellect and imagination of those\n\npeople.\n Such preferred patternings of the black experience as are deliberately\n\nmisrepresented and discounted, have pushed the blacks ( in Africa and\n\nthe diaspora) into dialectical defence, for survival and beyond. \n\n  Africans have long turned the weapons of their denigration against\n\ntheir oppressors and so to many people of African ancestry, black aesthetics\n\ntakes on positive meaning in the fight against such denigration.\n Yet one can be sucked into arguments that are shaped by European\n\nexperience about self-worth and about the credit worthiness of this or that\n\nwork of art created out of the experience, world-view(s), or ontological\n\nconfigurations of people of African ancestry. \n\n  The temptation to be sucked in is indeed great especially when\n\nthe black man functions in an environment of power over which he has no\n\ncontrol.\n Hence the adoption of the terms and attitudes of a Eurocentric\n\ntradition of aesthetic description, evaluation and criticism.\n Thus the search for the irreducible kernel of the African experience,\n\nwherever it was found, was conducted using non-African concepts. \n\n \n\n  \n\n  It was from an exiled African, Aimé Césaire of\n\nMartinique,  that the world received the gift of a\n\nnew and resonant designation for that quest by blacks for the ideal, form and\n\npurpose they knew to reside in their African heritage. \n 1 Aimé Césaire was born in Martinique in June 1911, and\n\neducated in Paris, France, where he met Léon Damas of French Guiana\n\nand Léopold S&euml;dar Senghor of Senegal.\n \'legendary founders of the Black\n\nAwareness Movement known as Négritude\'  .\n A foremost thinker of the twentieth century\'s Black Consciousness\n\nMovement, Césaire is a practising politician in his native Martinique\n\nbesides being an acclaimed poet, playwright, literary critic, and\n\nphilosopher. \n It came at a time when that heritage was facing the threat of\n\nenfeeblement from assimilationism in the case of the Francophones and from\n\ncounterpart afflictions which had been the target of assault by men like\n\nMarcus Garvey and William Du Bois among the Anglophones.  \n\n  2 Francophone black awareness had its forerunner in ( a) the\n\nGarvey Movement led by Jamaica visionary and activist, Marcus Mosiah Garvey,\n\nfounder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association ( UNIA), who worked\n\nout of Harlem and influenced liberation movements among blacks all over the\n\nAmericas and in colonial Africa itself, and ( b) the Harlem Renaissance in\n\nwhich the scholar and a leading intellectual William Du Bois was a major\n\nfigure.\n Dr Du Bois is considered one of the fathers of Pan- Africanism, a\n\nmovement that saw Africans and peoples of African ancestry outside the\n\nAfrican continent joining forces for effective political action to fight\n\nracism and African denigration. \n\n  The Marcus Garvey ( and UNIA) Papers\n\n ( UCLA Press, 1983); Rupert Lewis,  Marcus Garvey: Anti-colonial\n\nChampion  ( London, Karia Press, 1987); Rex Nettleford,  \'Garvey\'s\n\nLegacy: Some Perspectives\'  in Rupert Lewis and Patrick Bryan ( eds)\n\n Garvey; His Work and Impact  ( Mona, 1988) being proceedings of the\n\nSymposium on Marcus Garvey held at the University of the West Indies in\n\nNovember 1987; Amy Jacques Garvey,  Garvey and Garveyism  (\n\nKingston, A.J.

Heath & Co., 1971), pp. 110-25\n\nand reprinted from  Diogenes  No.16 ( Winter 1956) pp. 23- 38.\n\n\n The essay could have been easily dismissed as an example of\n\nEurocentric aesthetics. \n\n  Indeed, 13 years later a younger generation found a spirited\n\nspokesman in the person of one Stanislas Adotevi  who at the Pan-African Cultural Festival held in Algiers in 1969 took\n\nnot just the aesthetics of Négritude but all of Négritude to\n\ntask for being too fey to deal seriously with the harsh reality of armed\n\nstruggle and the technological modernisation of a slothful African society.\n\n\n in\n\n The Ideology of Blackness  ed. with Introduction by Raymond Betts (\n\nLexington, Massachusetts, D.C. Heath & Co., 1971), pp. 186-96, and reprinted\n\nfrom  The Black Scholar  , 1 November 1969. Dr Adotevi, who at the\n\ntime of writing his essay was Commissioner General for Culture and Youth in\n\nDahomey ( later Benin), presented his Paper at the Pan-African Cultural\n\nfestival, held in Algiers in the summer of 1969.\n That festival was reportedly organized as a rejoinder to the Festival\n\nof Negro Arts held in Dakar in 1966, in celebration of Négritude.\n The Adotevi contribution was enthusiastically received as one of the\n\nmore forceful interventions in the conference which sought to discredit\n\nNégritude as a meaningful ideology for modern Africa.\n Black Scholar\n\n 1 ( 1969) pp. 2-10. \n Both of these duties had by then become to many the only meaningful\n\nones in response to the very humiliation that Négritude had sought to\n\naddress but failed to destroy.\n Adotevi, with the anguish and anger of youthful impatience and the\n\nthirst for less poetic resistance against an affliction of ages, declared\n\n \'Today this humiliation is still apparent and the problem posed by\n\nNégritude remains.\' \n \'the values which distinguish the\n\nBlack world from that of the white man,\'  Adotevi graciously\n\nacknowledged as  \'the first moment of present-day requirements& one of\n\nthe possible forms for the struggle of emancipation, especially in the realm\n\nof artistic creation.\' \n To this young and ardent critic Négritude even represented the\n\n \'courage& needed to dare protest against the humiliation of the\n\nthirties\'  .\n But the new generation, according to Adotevi, found this wanting.\n And in the spirit of the time when Black Power and the ideas of Fanon\n\nwere in the ascendancy, Négritude was all but replaced by what the\n\ncritic called  \'Melanism\'  . \n\n\n 5 The doctrine of Melanism was the alternative offered by Stanislas\n\nAdotevi to Négritude.\n ( from Melanism\n\nmeaning darkness of colour deemed to result from  \'abnormal\n\ndevelopment of black pigment in epidermis\'  etc.) was seen by Adotevi\n\nas a source of energy for  \'unceasingly renewed action\'  as\n\nagainst the literary indulgences of Négritude.\n \'cementing force and thought\n\nwhich, operating in the perspective of unity, reacts on particular\n\nsensibilities as do Margrabism and Arabism\'  .\n \'\n\n1. &It is not a new racialism but an identification.\n It is an affirmation of the plain fact that to be Negro today is\n\nstill to live through the violent degradations of the slave trade.\n 2. Melanism is the acceptance of a state of war, but with arms other\n\nthan prayers and Negro Spirituals ( it being)  " an act of humanity to\n\ntake up arms in the defence of a people for whom arms are the only\n\nresource" [ as Machiavelli said] and 3. Melanism will be the unique\n\nresource of a people who can no longer decorate their torture with trophies\n\nconquered from shame&\n We must give the lie to negation by assigning positive tasks to each\n\nNegro\'.

( 1971), page 192.\n\n \n\n  At the heart of this stirring missionary statement was a sense\n\nof history, with its chronic humiliation starting with the slave trade to be\n\navenged by the recognition of a state of war seeking affirmation in positive\n\naction.\n For the immediate task, according to the young rebels, was not to\n\ndecorate the torture of history  \'with trophies conquered from shame\'\n\n - in reference, no doubt, to Négritude\'s aesthetically\n\nacceptable literary expressions in the torturer\'s lexicon and complete\n\nwith Eurocentric notions of the perfection of line, harmony, metric logic,\n\ntruth and beauty.\n The task rather was to address such issues as the methods of\n\nmodernization, the liberation of Africa from the old structures of the past,\n\nthe rational use of technology, the attainment of equality with African\n\nsocieties, the allocation of place and human purpose to black women and the\n\nyoung in society, a realistic approach to tribalism, and getting into\n\nperspective the role of traditional religions in modern African society.\n\n<fnr>  6  <fnr> \n\n\n\n\n  Beside such harsh evidence of existential reality in the late\n\nsixties, the primary involvement of Négritude with its literary\n\nconcerns, aesthetic sensibilities, the characteristics of a poem, dance,\n\nsong or carving seemed irrelevant and insipid.\n \' Négritude, hollow, vague and inefficient is an\n\nideology\'  insisted Adotevi.  \'There is no further place in\n\nAfrica for literature other than that of revolutionary combat,\'  he\n\ndeclared.  \' Négritude is dead.\' \n The literary indulgences of Négritude were too far divorced\n\nfrom the ordinary activities of humiliated Africans and from what Adotevi\n\nreferred to as  \'the daily problems which must be solved immediately\'\n\n . \n\n \n\n  Yet part of Senghor\'s claims for the aesthetics of\n\nNégritude was that  \'literature and art ( to the Africans) are\n\nnot separable from men\'s generic activities, particularly from the artisan\'s\n\ntechniques.\' \n The functionality of art, with Man at the centre of the process of\n\ncreation, affirms Man\'s  \'individual essence\'  .\n But African literature and art are also collective, taking on\n\nmeaning through the participation of the  \'anonymous masses who sing,\n\ndance, carve and paint\'  . By their very nature, functionality and\n\ncollectivity in turn commit the persons involved both as individuals and as\n\nmembers of the community, precisely because, according to Senghor, lit <l>\n\nerature and art for the Africans  \'are techniques of essentialisation\'\n\n .  \n ( 1971), page 114-15.\n\n \n\n  In this sense Négritude is a search for essences.\n The now classic dismissal of the movement as an exercise in futility\n\nsince the  \'tiger does not concern itself with its tigritude\' \n\n raises questions about the black man\'s own claim to\n\nfull and unfettered membership in the human race. \n 9 The pun is attributed to the poet-playwright and Noble-Laureate\n\nWole Soyinka of Nigeria. \n For his irresistible claim lies in the fact that he, as Man, is\n\nable to  think  and follow through to action on the basis of his\n\nthought(s).\n To equate him with a tiger in any literal sense is to fall prey to\n\nassumptions about the black man\'s legendary location outside the very species\n\nthat sets great store by the gift of culture in the creative exercise of his\n\nimagination and intellect \x13 something reportedly not within the reach of\n\nliving organisms such as tigers.\n The tiger is not concerned about his tigritude indeed.\n But that may well by why Man is able to cage him and not he Man.\n And when Man attempts to deprive the tiger of his natural habitat,\n\nthe tiger fights back, which may well be that animal\'s way of asserting his\n\ntigritude.\n Well, if with the tiger, how much more with the human being!\n Deprivation of self and society has never failed to attract\n\nresistance from, and assertion of self-preservation by, the human being.\n Man is by nature concerned with the essence of himself: it makes\n\nsense that men like Césaire, Senghor and Léon Damas approached\n\ntheir liberation from this angle.\n The Gallic concerns with things ontological were part of the\n\napparatus of assimilationist education meted out to French-speaking Africans\n\nto whom the search for essences came more naturally than to their Anglophone\n\ncounterparts, whose Anglo-Saxon education often eschews such essays into what\n\nEdmund Burke, the English philosopher, might well have dismissed as\n\nmetaphysical nonsenses.  \n 10 Attributed to the English philosopher, Edmund Burke, in his\n\nobjections to the natural-rights claims made by protagonists of the French\n\nRevolution.\n \'Reflections on the Revolution in France\'\n\n in  Durham University Journal  , Vol. XIV, No. 3, June\n\n1953, and Charles Parkin  The Moral Basis of Burke\'s Political Thought\n\n ( Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1956), Chapter II.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '45099365-a06a-44e8-8fcf-6dbcaf71cae6', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.337446+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9470077753067017, 'non_english_score': 0.05299222469329834}
{'text': "Whither Caribbean Socialism? Grenada, Jamaica, and Guyana in\n\nPerspective  \n\n \n\n  SOCIALIST TRANSFORMATION has often been seen by the left intelli\n\n<l> gentsia of the Caribbean as the optimal development path.\n That socialist vision has now been informed by various efforts within\n\nthe region to break out of the limiting confines of capitalist economic\n\nmanagement and to embrace varieties of socialist practice and policy.\n The experiences of Guyana in the 1970s and early 1980s, Jamaica in the\n\n1970s, and Grenada between 1979 and 1983 are three notable efforts in this\n\ndirection.\n They provide, in different ways, interesting evidence on the limits\n\nand potential of socialist initiatives in the Caribbean region. \n\n  What is meant by socialism? For one thing, the concept overlaps\n\nconsiderably different political economy structures; sharp controversy also\n\nexists over whether the label appropriately describes regimes claiming\n\nallegiance to the socialist ideology broadly defined.\n Several Marxist commentators, for example, have challenged the claims\n\nto genuine socialist practice by the Manley regime in Jamaica in the\n\n1970s and by Guyana under the late Forbes Burnham. \n\n\n 1. Clive Thomas in fact classifies these regimes as being state\n\ncapitalist rather than socialist.\n (\n\nParamaribo, Suriname: Foundation in Arts and Sciences, 1982, mimeo.).\n\n \n\n  Socialism involves commitment to certain specific development ob\n\n<l> jectives.\n These include large-scale redistribution of wealth, assets, or income\n\nin favor of the majority classes and the assignment of a dominant role for\n\nthe state in economic management to further the life chances of the majority\n\nand to reduce, control, or eliminate the power of capitalists.\n Socialist theory and practice diverge on the most effective means of\n\nachieving these common objectives and on the accompanying political\n\nstructures necessary to activate socialist economic development. \n\n  Social democrats seek to operate within the framework of\n\nessentially capitalist economies, seeking to humanize them and reform them\n\nthrough redistributive, populist, social service, and social welfare poli <l>\n\ncies.\n More radical socialist commitments attempt to overturn the capital\n\n<l> ist economy and replace it with a political economy controlled by the\n\nstate on behalf of the people.\n Theory and practice within both the reformist social democratic\n\napproach and the revolutionary Marxist-Leninist approach diverge also on the\n\nquestion of ownership of the means of production.\n Emphases vary also with respect to designs to transform the\n\nproductive capacity of an economy along socialist lines as against priorities\n\nthat concentrate on redistribution.\n Further confusion is added by the fact that socialist regimes often\n\nembrace theories and articulate principles that diverge considerably from\n\ntheir actual practice. \n\n  Somewhere between the reformist social democratic regimes and the\n\nMarxist- Leninist political economies are regimes that ultimately seek to\n\nmove toward the latter by gradual but decisive political and policy steps\n\nthat take them toward a so-called noncapitalist path. \n\n \n Socialism and the Newly Independent\n\nNations  ( Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1974). \n This intermediary position has structural features that combine\n\ncapitalist elements with initiatives toward a state-managed socialist\n\neconomy. \n\n  The promise of socialist development has also been associated\n\nwith the objective of reducing dependence on world capitalism and its domi\n\n<l> nant system in the region ( the United Stated) as well as with the\n\ninter-linked objectives of greater economic self-reliance, more decisive\n\nlocally controlled and inward-looking development policies, as well as\n\ngreater local political autonomy, dignity, and self-respect. \n\n  Implicit in the socialist promise is the democratic claim that\n\nsocialist management of power is more responsive to majority interests, is\n\nmore accountable, and provides more extensive channels for mass political\n\nparticipation.\n Strategies to deepen democracy or claims in that direction invariably\n\naccompany efforts at socialist economic management.\n Socialist management of power, it is claimed, is able to achieve\n\na greater deconcentration of political power. \n\n  The interest in socialist transformation and its potential has\n\ngenerated considerable attention due to the deeply rooted economic and\n\nsocial problems that remain unsolved in the English-speaking Caribbean under\n\ncapitalist economic management.\n These include high levels of open unemployment; extreme concentration\n\nof income; distressing poverty levels among the bottom 40 percent of\n\nhousehold; extreme dependence on and vulnerability to trade, financial,\n\nconsumer, and fiscal trends within the world capitalist system; weak\n\nproduction structures, dependent on one or two main sources of hard-\n\ncurrency earnings; enormous idle capacity in agriculture; extensive foreign\n\nownership and export of capital; weak entrepreneurial traditions, centered\n\nmore on mercantile activity rather than on production; and massive outflows\n\nof skills through emigration. \n\n  Whether socialist economic management offers real solutions is an\n\nissue that remains largely unexamined beyond the rhetorical claims and\n\nassertions of the left and the equally strident counterclaims of\n\nantisocialist adversaries.\n To confront this issue adequately requires some conceptual\n\nclarification of the development assumptions of socialist thought and a\n\nconcrete specification of the precise nature of the root causes of Caribbean\n\neconomic underdevelopment. \n\n  Because Marxist and social democratic notions of development\n\nemerged as antitheses to capitalism within the core economies of the world\n\ncapitalist system, both assumed that capitalism had developed a productive\n\ncapability that socialist management could build on to achieve its class and\n\nsocial objectives.\n The social democrats sought to harness the income base generated by\n\ndynamic private entrepreneurs to redistribute some of it in the direction of\n\nimproving the quality of life of the poor through welfare state policies.\n Additionally, it was thought that the creative and productive\n\nenergies of private capital could be channeled more toward national\n\ndevelopment by state regulation.\n Marxist development thought presumes that the task of revolution\n\nlies in taking hold of the productive forces created by capitalism and using\n\nthem for the benefit of the majority classes rather than for the purpose of\n\ncapitalist profit generation.\n These essentially Western European assumptions have no basis\n\nwhen applied to Third World regions like the Caribbean, where the priority\n\ndevelopment task lies in building a strong and viable production base, as a\n\nlong history of retarded growth through colonialism, dependence, and\n\nimperialism has left a legacy of an undeveloped productive capacity.\n\n\n\n  Two Marxist views on development in the Third World are more\n\nrelevant to the Caribbean situation.\n The first argues for a development alternative via socialism, which\n\nwould avoid the excess of materialism and acquisitiveness associated with\n\ncapitalism.\n This type of no frills development would seek to reorganize the\n\nforces of production to meet the food, shelter, clothing, health,\n\neducational, and other welfare needs of the majority classes.  \n 3. North Korea and China ( under Mao) represent models of this type\n\nof no-frills socialist development.\n Prescription of this path for the Caribbean is set out in George\n\nBeckford and Michael Witter,  Small Garden, Bitter Weed: Struggle and\n\nChange in Jamaica  ( Morant Bay, Jamaica: Maroon, 1980).\n The basic- needs model of socialist development is comprehensively\n\nanalyzed in Carl Stone,  Profiles of Power in the Caribbean Basin  (\n\nPhiladelphia: ISHI, 1986). ch. 6. \n The goal of mass affluence, or a high material level of living, is\n\nportrayed as a capitalist design to promote overconsumption.\n Needs rather than wants would be satisfied, and equality assured.\n\nSuch an objective is realizable within the context of the productive\n\ncapability of Caribbean economies.\n Its advantage over the present situation in the English-speaking\n\nCaribbean is that it would reduce or eliminate much of the hard-core poverty\n\nand unemployment among the bottom 40 percent of income earners.\n The disadvantage is that it would have nothing to offer to the top 60\n\npercent of income earners \x13 except a drastically reduced standard of living.\n\n\n\n  The alternative Marxist view still clings to the idea of\n\nsocialism as capable of transforming the productive capacity of Third World\n\ncapitalism and of beginning to bring the full fruits of modern\n\ntechnology within the grasp of the world's working class.  \n The Political Economy of Growth\n\n ( New York: Monthly Review Press, 1957). \n Here the vision of socialism coexisting with abundance and high\n\nmaterial standards of living is kept intact, although its realization can\n\nonly occur after the collapse of the world capitalist system.\n Underlying this view is a Leninist faith and optimism that the world\n\ncapitalist system is destined to collapse and the task of Third World\n\ndevelopment is to prepare to partake in an alternative socialist development.\n Here the Prescription is for a development effort toward a\n\nnoncapitalist path.\n Success or failure cannot be judged in terms of whether incomes\n\nincrease or mass welfare improves.\n Rather, the key criterion is whether development is moved toward\n\nsocialism to ensure that these countries keep pace with the unfolding pattern\n\nof inevitable world historical development from capitalism to socialism. \n\n  Underlying this socialist view of development is the idea that\n\npolitics takes command of economic forces and guides them in a direction that\n\nis either historically correct or designed to put them at the service of the\n\nmajority classes.\n In the Caribbean situation, it acquires currency as an escape route\n\nfrom imperialism, class exploration, and dependency.\n Socialist development thought in the Third World and the Caribbean\n\nfocuses on the consolidation of power, the development, and a historically\n\ncorrect view of world political alignments.\n The result is that an overloaded agenda of political concerns crowds\n\nout detailed and technical economic policy questions.  \n 5. There is in fact not a single comprehensive work by a Marxist\n\ntheorist that deals with the technical issues of transformation to socialism\n\nin the specific context of Caribbean economies.\n Dependence and Transformation: The Economics of\n\nthe Transition to Socialism  ( New York: Monthly Review Press, 1984),\n\ncomes close, but it deals with the issue within the general Third World\n\nframework rather than addressing the specificities of the Caribbean context.\n\n\n These relate to economic strategies and tactics; the nature of the\n\nexisting world capitalist system and how to maximize one's development policy\n\noptions within it; the level of existing productive capability and how to\n\nadvance it; how to go about obtaining development financing and to\n\nimprove one's position in the fields of technology and trade; and what forms\n\nof economic planning are feasible, given the political capacity and\n\nadministrative resource capability.\n The result quite often is that conventional capitalist economic\n\nstrategies are borrowed and combined with socialist political strategies,\n\nleading to development that is contradictory, internally inconsistent, and\n\nconfusing to both those who lead and those who follow.  \n 6. This was certainly a problem of the Manley regime in Jamaica.\n\n \n\n  Socialist development in the Caribbean can therefore be judged\n\naccording to a number of criteria.\n\n\n  1. Has it enhanced or improved the well-being and welfare of the\n\nmajority classes? \n\n  2. Is it seeking to establish a reorganized basic-needs socialist\n\neconomy, or is it working within the capitalist market economy, albeit with\n\nhigh levels of state regulation control or ownership? \n\n  3. Is it Marxist or social democratic in ideological alignment?\n\n\n\n  4. Is the accompanying political system liberal democratic or\n\nbased on the political prescriptions of the concapitalist path, which seeks\n\nto establish political hegemony around a strong and dominant populist or\n\nmajoritarian political ideology? \n\n  5. Are the development priorities biased toward consolidation of\n\npower, biased toward economic transformation strategies, or are they balanced\n\nevenly? \n\n  6. How do the strategies of international alignment serve or\n\nundermine the economic policy thrust, and what is optimal given existing\n\nworld economic realities? \n\n  7. How far are the socialist goals ( economic or political)\n\ncompatible with the aspirations, values, and culture of Caribbean people?\n\n\n\n  8. How fare are the economic and social objectives of socialist\n\npractice likely to address the concrete or structural economic problems in\n\nthe region? \n\n  9. To what extent are socialist politics consistent with the\n\naccompanying economic policies? \n\n  In examining the attempts at socialist development in Grenada,\n\nand Jamaica, and Guyana it will be useful to compare and evaluate these\n\nregimes according to these criteria. \n\n  There are essentially three basic structural problems in\n\nEnglish-speaking Caribbean countries.\n Firstly, as middle-income third World countries, they have\n\nconsiderably raised their post-World War II living standards through\n\noverdependence on mineral and primary products exports ( bauxite, oil, sugar,\n\nbananas, etc.) to buoyant and lucrative core capitalist markets.\n Major downward shifts in prices and market demand for those exports\n\nhave meant drastic declines in the capacity to import.\n High dependence on imports ( due to small size and to a legacy of\n\neconomic dependence) makes the region extraordinarily vulnerable to adverse\n\nprice and supply changes in international commodity or consumer goods\n\nmarkets.\n Third, import dependence combined with technological dependence\n\nmean that investment expansion to extend, enlarge, and diversify\n\nproductive capacity require foreign investment, loans, credit, or aid to\n\nbring such ( public or private) investment projects to fruition.\n Policies to address these problems all require a capacity to mobilize\n\ninternational or foreign resources or to penetrate overseas markets.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '75f92510-fbac-4e45-9d09-744ae1f6df0a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.338975+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9364644885063171, 'non_english_score': 0.06353551149368286}
{'text': 'LESSONS FROM THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROCESS IN\n\nJAMAICA   \n\n  * The\n\nviews expressed in this paper are the author\'s and not necessarily those of\n\nthe Bank of Jamaica  \n\n \n\n \n\ntries with protracted international payments problems is that policies should\n\nbe pursued which lead to a more efficient allocation of resources\n\ninternally and that a shift into the production of exportable goods should be\n\nencouraged.\n With financial assistance tied to the adoption of this advice, what\n\nusually follows is a series of measures to increase public savings, constrain\n\ndomestic demand for importables and, as far as practicable, a withdrawal of\n\nintervention in the pricing system.\n A transparent system of prices, it is argued, supported by adequate\n\ninformation and freedom of action, leads inevitably to a more efficient and\n\nrational use of resources and a consequent improvement in living\n\nstandards.\n The free market and its political counterpart, democracy, now\n\nrepresent the prevailing tenet in development thinking. \n\n \n\ntries.\n\n\nsources and industries, in planning and in safeguarding the welfare of the\n\nordinary citizen was for many years the accepted norm in Europe, with the\n\nstate becoming more pervasive as one moved eastwards.\n The North American version of this thinking was manifested in an\n\nincreasing tax rate and growing public sector deficits which were used to\n\nsupport subsidies on income, medical care, food and housing for the less\n\nfortunate.\n Studies in benevolent state intervention spawned think tanks and\n\ncivil rights groups and became a strong branch of the literature during the\n\ndecades of the 1960s and 1970s when considerations of social welfare and\n\nprotection guided the invisible hand of private economic endeavour. \n\n  These broad swings in international politico-economic thinking\n\nhave been reflected in the perceived role of the state in Caribbean economies\n\nand perhaps most intensely in Jamaica.\n Following political independence with the champions of the\n\nlabour movement at the helm, the stance of the government was one of\n\nwelfare-mindful industrialisation.\n The generous incentives to foreign investors which had begun in the\n\n1950s continued to create jobs in mining, tourism, manufacturing and export\n\nagriculture while new social legislation and collective bargaining protected\n\nthe  " rights"  of workers.\n But these enclaves of industrial wealth were relatively small\n\nand isolated and stood in stark contrast with a much lower average per capita\n\nincome in traditional occupations despite impressive annual rates of growth\n\nin GDP.\n These gaps in income distribution amid the mood of liberalism and\n\nself actualisation sweeping North America heralded a change of government in\n\nthe early 1970s and a shift in the perceived role of government in a popular\n\ndemocracy. \n\n  During that decade, the governing party joined the ranks of the\n\ninternational socialist movement.\n The thinking of the government was guided by notions of equity,\n\nsocial justice and the collective good of the community.\n This philosophy found its most important expression in the\n\nnationalisation of the  " commanding heights"  of the economy\n\n\x13 the land, mineral deposits, major export industries, financial\n\ninstitutions and utilities - and in socio-economic legislation which\n\nsignificantly increased the share of national income accruing to labour.\n\n \n 1 Compensation of employees as a share of factor income increased\n\nfrom 50.1% in 1970 to 56.6% in 1976.\n\n Economic strategy was focused inwards for self reliance in basic\n\ncommodities and embracing cooperative mechanisms for production, housing\n\nand finance.\n , output,\n\nespecially of exportables, fell steadily.\n Buoyed by an overvalued exchange rate, trade restrictions and\n\nprice controls, a large market for illegal imports emerged which, when\n\ncombined with heavy capital outflows, led to a growing balance of payments\n\ndeficit.\n By 1980, the inherent contradictions in the economy constituted a\n\nfertile milieu for the adoption of concepts identified with a new wave of\n\nAnglo-American conservatism\n In economic terms, the leaders of this movement advocated lower\n\ntaxation, private ownership and productivity versus redistribution,\n\ncollectivism and state-sponsored welfare benefits. \n\n \n\nsued for most of the decade of the 1980s, particularly after 1983.\n Official documents frequently repeated that these policies were de\n\n<l> signed with the intention of setting the economy on  " an\n\nexport-led, private sector-driven, self-sustaining growth path"  .\n Supported with heavy financial backing from the multilateral\n\ndevelopment institutions and the blessings of the IMF ( for most of the\n\nperiod), the government set about reorienting production based on market\n\ndetermined competitive advantage while smoothing the transition to the\n\npattern of income distribution consistent with this model\n\n\n was to be

the outcome to date. \n\n  The review which forms the remainder of this paper is arranged as\n\nfollows:\n Section 2 examines the structure of the economy prior to the effort\n\nat adjustment, the pattern of output, income, the price and incentive systems\n\nand the likely direction of indicators given the existing set of\n\npolicies.\n Section 3 describes the structural adjustment measures, the\n\ninstitutional changes and the external support which attended them.\n This is followed by a statistical and qualitative assessment of\n\nthe degree of transformation which ensued and the extent to which the process\n\nhas lived up to expectations.\n The concluding section attempts to draw some lessons form the\n\nexperience of the process, some of which may be useful for other countries\n\nfacing adjustment. \n\n \n\n  From political independence in 1962 up to 1972 Jamaica enjoyed\n\nsteady growth, with GDP expanding at a real average annual rate of 5.3%.\n Direct foreign investment in bauxite, alumina and tourism, combined\n\nwith domestic financial stability, contributed to this performance.\n But overall employment grew at a much lower rate, reflecting in\n\npart a shift away from labour-intensive agriculture to bauxite/alumina\n\nand import- substitution manufacturing.\n In 1974 the economy started a sustained contraction, with real GDP\n\ndeclining by about 3% per annum and unemployment rising to almost 28% in\n\n1980.\n\n\ncal division, inappropriate sector policies and macroeconomic man <l>\n\nagement, compounded by adverse external developments. \n\n  Despite the prosperity of the late 1960s there was growing socio\n\n<l> economic dissatisfaction and a clamour for reform.\n Income disparities were marked.\n In all the major productive sectors \x13 agriculture, mining,\n\nmanufacturing \x13 as well as the utilities and financial institutions,\n\nownership and wealth were concentrated in very few hands, many of them\n\nforeign.\n The thrust of Government policy in most of these areas was to acquire\n\nland, enterprises and equity participation in most areas of the economy on\n\nbehalf of the public and to widen the availability of social services to the\n\ngeneral population.\n The redistributive stance of the government created unease\n\nbetween the private sector and itself which translated in short order\n\ninto considerable flight of capital,  closing of\n\nenterprises, and tax evasion.\n As a result, and although public investment grew as a share of total\n\ninvestment, total investment declined abruptly. \n\n  Overall agricultural production declined from 1972 to 1980, with\n\nexport agriculture falling sharply, while domestic food crop production\n\nincreased.\n The decline of export agriculture was related to pricing\n\npolicies.\n Farmgate prices for export crops were regulated by the Marketing\n\nBoards and they lagged behind the unregulated farmgate prices for domestic\n\ncrops.\n Export crops were produced in an increasingly regulated\n\nenvironment and suffered from under-investment and an incentive system which\n\nfavoured the production of domestic crops. \n\n  One goal of the government was to extend Jamaican control over\n\nthe bauxite/alumina industry.\n In 1975 a government holding company was formed that took a 51%\n\nequity position in Kaiser and Reynolds and a minority position in Alcoa and\n\nAlcan and engaged in external bauxite/alumina trading on its own account.\n An attempt was made to emulate OPEC by promoting the establishment of\n\nan industrial cartel of bauxite producers between 1973 and 1974.\n In April 1974 Jamaica introduced a controversial 7.5% production\n\nlevy, and government revenue from bauxite/alumina production rose seven fold.\n Imposition of the bauxite levy was followed by the start of the\n\ndecline in the Jamaican bauxite/alumina industry.\n This decline was subsequently aggravated by the inflation of energy\n\nprices and fluctuations in world demand and sourcing of bauxite. \n\n  Manufacturing production peaked in 1973; by 1980, it was 30%\n\nlower.\n This result was partly caused by shortages of foreign exchange,\n\nfrequent labour unrest, unavailability of skilled manpower ( due to\n\nintensified emigration) and deterioration of the country\'s infrastruc <l>\n\nture.\n The small domestic market was reaching its saturation point while the\n\nopening of the CARICOM markets diverted manufactured exports away from third\n\ncountries instead of stimulating higher production levels.\n The import- substituting oriented industries set up in the 1950s and\n\n1960s were ill-prepared to face world markets.\n Besides, the protective system based on quantitative\n\nrestrictions on imports made sales to extra-regional markets less\n\nprofitable than sales to the sheltered but limited CARICOM market, and these\n\nin turn were less profitable than sales to the domestic market. \n\n \n\nrate with the public sector\'s new role and expansion. The public sector\'s\n\ndeficit consequently grew dramatically.\n Financing this deficit resulted in a crowding out of the private\n\nsector and money creation.\n The latter, concurrent with a fixed exchange rate, caused the Jamaica\n\ndollar to become overvalued and contributed to a serious disequilibrium in\n\nthe external accounts. \n\n  There were other contributors to the balance of payments crisis.\n The maintenance of an overvalued exchange rate, the deterioration in\n\ninfrastructure as well as adverse publicity led to a deleterious fall in\n\ntourist arrivals and expenditure.\n Many properties were acquired by Government in the process.\n The new operators boosted occupancy by promoting local vacations by\n\nresidents.\n While these moves saved jobs, they were neither profitable nor\n\nhelpful to the balance of payments problem which was all the time being\n\naggravated by capital flight.\n With respect to the latter phenomenon, not even a stringent tighten\n\n<l> ing of exchange controls could succeed in stemming the outflow. \n\n  The decline of the Jamaican economy during the 1972-80 period\n\ncould hardly be ascribed to the external environment in any direct sense.\n Terms of trade movements were slightly favourable and only a part of\n\nthe trade volume and services deterioration was due to external reasons.\n The massive increase in oil and other import prices in the early\n\n1970s was more than compensated for by increases in Jamaican export prices.\n Jamaica\'s terms of trade declined over the two years 1973-1974 but\n\nshowed a significant recovery between 1974 and 1978.\n The oil shocks, however, had severe indirect effects on the bauxite\n\nindustry.\n Because the aluminium reduction process is energy intensive, the rise\n\nin world fuel prices induced the relocation of facilities towards\n\nenergy-rich countries, reducing demand for Jamaican alumina.\n The demand for Jamaican bauxite was also affected by rising\n\ntransport costs which favoured production of alumina near the bauxite source.\n Jamaica\'s share in the world bauxite production declined from\n\n23.2% in 1965 to 13% in 1979.\n In value terms, however, the decline of Jamaican export volume was\n\ncompensated for by imposition of the 1974 levy, and net earnings from\n\nthe bauxite/alumina sector rose by more than the increase in the oil bill.\n\n\n\n  There were efforts over the period to arrest the economic decline\n\nand to offset the effects of reduced export earnings.\n The government increased external borrowing, tightened fiscal policy,\n\nand introduced extensive import restrictions and exchange controls.\n Still, the depletion of the foreign reserves of the Bank of Jamaica\n\ncontinued.\n\n\ntered into uneasy relationships with the IMF and the World Bank in\n\nnegotiating financial support for the balance of payments. \n\n  The adjustment efforts were however neither long-lived nor\n\nextensive.\n The exchange rate remained fixed and pegged to the US dollar from\n\n1973 until April 1977, when a dual exchange rate was established.\n Under an agreement signed in July 1977 with the IMF, Jamaica\n\nundertook to restore the Central Bank\'s foreign reserves, sharply reduce the\n\nfiscal deficit, restrict domestic credit expansion and limit foreign\n\nborrowing.\n The IMF agreement, however, did not call for a curtailment of public\n\nemployment and social programs, or for the removal of price controls and\n\nsubsidies.\n Jamaica was also allowed to maintain the new dual exchange rate, as\n\nwell as the quantitative restrictions on imports.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '37ce8cf7-7b16-4822-a88c-b65654bf238e', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.340517+00:00', 'english_score': 0.964576005935669, 'non_english_score': 0.035423994064331055}
{'text': "Natural disasters destabilize the economy.\n The more wide-scale is the impact of the disaster, the greater is the\n\ndegree of instability which the system is likely to experience.\n The disaster may be sufficiently extensive and severe, to give rise to\n\nchanges in both the composition and levels of investment, as well as the flow\n\nand level of exports. \n\n  The resumption of economic activities and the restoration of\n\nmacro- economic stability at the level of economic activity which is\n\nwarranted by prevailing conditions during the post disaster period, are among\n\nthe important tasks of the economic and other managers, during the post\n\ndisaster period. \n\n  This paper examines in brief, the impact of natural disasters on\n\nmacro- economic performance and on the essential steps required for the\n\nrestoration of normalcy in the operations of the economy.\n The steps which may be taken on an ongoing basis to moderate the\n\neconomic impact of natural disasters are identified and the link between\n\nthese measures and the performance of the economy during the post disaster\n\nperiod are examined. \n\n  Some of the steps which may be taken during the pre-disaster\n\nperiod to assist the post-disaster adjustment process and to return the\n\neconomy to normalcy and stability within the shortest possible time-frame are\n\nreviewed in brief in the final segment of the document. \n\n \n\n  There exists a condition of macro-economic stability where there\n\nis internal and external balance.\n There is internal balance where total desired consumption and\n\ninvestment expenditures plus desired exports are equal to the maximum output\n\nlevel which is sustainable plus the total imports of goods and services. \n\n  Price increases may be moderate under conditions of stability\n\nsince total desirable expenditure is equal to total realizable output and\n\nthere is no excess demand in goods, services and factor markets. \n\n  For those economies which can meet only a small part of their\n\nrequirements of investment goods, there is a state of internal balance and\n\nstability where realizable output plus the external current account deficit\n\nfor which there is adequate funding, is equal to total desirable expenditure\n\n( consumption plus investment). Many developing countries find themselves in\n\nthis position. \n\n  The economy enjoys a state of external balance where over an\n\nextended period, the total demand for foreign exchange is equal to the total\n\nsupply of foreign exchange.\n For those economies which are not in the fortunate position of being\n\nholders of embarrassingly huge international reserves, the definition of\n\nexternal balance envisages the build-up of international reserves, in as much\n\nas the supply of foreign exchange exceeds the demand for foreign exchange\n\nduring the period of reserve accumulation.\n The build-up of international reserves on the basis of capital\n\ninflows ( public and private) in the face of current account deficits, is\n\nleast painful and most beneficial where long-term private capital inflows\n\nconstitute the major component of total capital inflows. \n\n  The achievement and maintenance of internal and external balance\n\nat the highest sustainable levels of economic activity or with high and\n\nsustainable rates of growth of gross domestic product and high employment\n\nlevels, is currently the focus of most economic stabilization programmes.\n Sustainable output growth rates accompanied by stable prices and\n\nimprovements in the economy's international reserves are currently the main\n\nfeatures of most stabilization programmes. \n\n  Natural disasters do give rise to internal instability which is\n\nmanifested in extraordinary rates of inflation.\n More often than not, they create imbalances between desirable\n\nexpenditure and realizable output which, in the very short-term, cannot be\n\nbridged by inducing steep increases in imports even where the availability of\n\nfinancial resources is not the principal inhibiting factor.\n It may be a situation in which the physical movement of goods and\n\nservices cannot be undertaken before shortages within the system manifest\n\nthemselves in upward movements in prices. \n\n  Natural disasters such as hurricanes, which effect severe damage\n\nto agriculture and disrupt domestic food supplies, do impact strongly and\n\nspeedily on the general price level.\n Cost inflation which may have been a minor concern prior to the\n\ndisaster, may turn out to be a major contributor to domestic inflation after\n\nthe disaster.\n With higher levels of demand for labour as restoration works are\n\nmounted, labour rates may be paid at levels which are far in excess of\n\nestablished market rates, as individuals and firms hasten to rebuild and\n\nre-establish dwellings, office buildings, factory buildings, and other\n\nbusiness establishments.\n Furthermore, with business operations made more difficult by damages\n\nto plant, machinery and general infra-structure, productivity levels do fall\n\nbelow the norm for at least the initial phase of the restoration period. \n\n  The Jamaican experience of 1988 is worth noting.\n Just prior to the 1988 hurricane ( Hurricane Gilbert), the year to\n\ndate inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index was 3.05 per\n\ncent.\n This inflation rate compared very favourably with the inflation\n\ntarget of 7 per cent which was programmed for that year.\n There was an acceleration of inflation during the immediate\n\npost-hurricane months.\n The year to date inflation rate increased from the 3.05 per cent just\n\nprior to the hurricane, to 8.3 per cent in November 1988. \n\n  The upward movements in the inflation rate were attributable to:\n\nthe dislocation in the domestic production and marketing of foods and the\n\ninadequacy of supply of imported food products.\n High levels of rebuilding activities during the post- hurricane\n\nperiod accompanied by supply shortfalls in respect of building materials,\n\ngave rise to steep increases in the prices of materials.\n There were shortages of skilled labour, which was acute in the case\n\nof certain skills.\n These factors combined, produced the acceleration in inflation\n\ndiscussed above. \n\n  The pace of inflation slowed considerably before the end of the\n\n1988/89 fiscal year as food and other product supplies were normalized.\n Domestic inflation which at November 1988, had been projected at some\n\n14 per cent for the fiscal year, reached 9.1 per cent for the fiscal year,\n\n2.1 percentage points above the programmed rate of 7.0 per cent. \n\n \n\n  The country's capacity to re-establish internal and external\n\nbalance and stability within the shortest period, is dependent upon the size\n\nof its international reserves, the country's capacity to organize external\n\nfinancial aid flows, and the speed with which normal flows can be\n\nre-established within the goods and services markets. \n\n  The Jamaican experience of 1988 and the immediate post-1988\n\nperiod, strongly support the position set out in the foregoing paragraphs.\n If the full impact of Hurricane Gilbert which struck in September\n\n1988, were reflected in the country's balance of trade deficit in the 1988/89\n\nfiscal year, the trade balance for that fiscal year would have increased by\n\nsome 119.5 per cent.\n This compares very unfavourably with a pre-hurricane projection of an\n\nincrease in the trade deficit of some 7.0 per cent.\n The actual increase in the deficit that year turned out to be 48.4\n\nper cent.\n With the surge in imports of building materials, machinery and food,\n\ncoupled with a marked decline in the value of exports of agro-based products\n\nand a wide range of other products, the dramatic increase in the size of the\n\ntrade deficit was unavoidable. \n\n  Despite this 48.4 per cent or US$243.1 million increase in the\n\ncountry's trade deficit during 1988/89, the external current account position\n\nimproved dramatically.\n Re- insurance inflows linked to the disaster, amounting to some\n\nUS$413.0 million and incremental flows of grant funds from official sources\n\nof some US$104.0 million, were the principal contributors to an external\n\ncurrent account out-turn of minus US$38.3 million.\n In the absence of these huge flows, the full impact of the\n\ndeterioration in the balance of trade would have been reflected in an\n\nexternal current account deficit of US$253.0 million. \n\n  If the country's stock of free international reserves at that\n\npoint in time were in excess of US$1.0 billion, an external current account\n\ndeficit increase of US$0.5 billion which is implied by a trade deficit of\n\nUS$1.1 billion and a fall-off of some US$104.0 million in tourism earnings,\n\ncould have been financed in that fiscal year without significant external\n\nassistance, by pulling down the stock of international reserves. \n\n  As a draw-down of international reserves of this magnitude would\n\nhave been unsustainable, the balance of payments position for that year would\n\nhave been as reflective of external instability as a major build-up of\n\nexternal payments arrears, which would have come about if the stock of\n\nreserves did not permit the magnitude of drawn-down warranted by the size of\n\nthe external current account deficit set out above. \n\n  It is clear, therefore, where the country's stock of\n\ninternational reserves is relatively small, the level of external financial\n\ninflows, the capability to secure commitments for such inflows and to\n\nmobilize them, are extremely important determinants of the speed with which\n\nmacro-economic stability may be restored and maintained during the\n\npost-disaster period. \n\n  This fact is illustrated by Jamaica's experience during the\n\nimmediate post Hurricane Gilbert period when, on account of added foreign\n\nexchange inflows of over US$500 million, a 48.4 per cent increase in the\n\nexternal trade balance did not give rise to a deterioration in the external\n\ncurrent account position of the country.\n There was, instead, - a significant improvement in the external\n\ncurrent account position. \n\n  Conditions of macro economic instability may not be removed from\n\nthe system during the early phase of the post disaster period.\n In the absence of careful and effective management of the economy,\n\nconditions of macro economic instability may persist for several years.\n The authorities must ensure, therefore, that the post disaster\n\nrestoration programme takes fully into account, the entire scope of the\n\nrestoration programme, the full foreign exchange and other cost of the\n\nprogramme and most importantly, the time-frame over which work will be\n\nundertaken. \n\n  The policies which underpin the programme must be formulated on\n\nthe basis of reasonably good judgement's about lags in the direct and\n\nindirect impact of the programme.\n Such issues as the multiplier impact of the expenditure programme,\n\ndirect and indirect foreign exchange demand as well as imbalances which may\n\narise in the flows of foreign exchange are critical. \n\n  The need for the foregoing approaches is illustrated by the\n\nexperience of the Jamaican economy during the 1989/90 and 1990/91 fiscal\n\nyears.\n The economy moved into a period of acute instability in 1989/90.\n This unstable condition intensified during the 1990/91 and 1991/92\n\nfiscal years.\n The external current account deficit deteriorated to minus US$297.6\n\nmillion in 1989/90, US$262.1 billion in 1990/91 and US$111.9 million in\n\n1991/92.\n There was marginal growth in exports during the period, yet\n\nmerchandise imports rose from US$1.6 billion in 1988/89 to US$1.9 billion in\n\n1989/90 and 1990/91.\n The net international reserves position of the country deteriorated\n\nby some US$182.9 million during the 1988/89 and 1989/90 fiscal years. \n\n  Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index increased at\n\nannual average rates of 16.3 per cent in 1989/90, 24.8 per cent in 1990/91\n\nand 68.6 per cent in 1991/92. \n\n  The inflation rate represented by the change in the GDP deflator,\n\nrose to 15.9 per cent in 1989/90, 24.2 per cent in 1990/91, 60.0 per cent in\n\n1991/92 and some 50.0 per cent in 1992/93. \n\n  Output growth rate rose to 3.7 per cent and 4.2 per cent in\n\n1989/90 and 1990/91 respectively, then fell to 1.2 per cent in 1991/92 and\n\n0.8 per cent in 1992/93. \n\n  Specific Actions for the Restoration or\n\nEstablishment of Stability   \n\n  The restoration of internal and external stability during the\n\npost disaster period, or the attainment of macro-economic stability, requires\n\nappropriate assessments during the very early phase of the post disaster\n\nperiod in order to build a sound foundation for the establishment of\n\nappropriate monetary and fiscal parameters accompanied by an appropriate role\n\nfor exchange rate policy. \n\n  The best possible assessment must be made of the level of\n\nspending which is financeable during the first year of the post disaster\n\nperiod, taking into account the phasing of such expenditures ( public sector\n\nprivate sector).\n A careful assessment of the growth rate of output, as well as the\n\nlikely inflationary impact of the restoration programme is required.\n The assessments of output growth, inflation and other such\n\nmacro-economic outcomes are critical inputs in the adjustments of monetary\n\nand fiscal policies, which must be undertaken during the period.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'MACROECONOMIC ADJUSTMENT IN EXTERNALLY-DEPENDENT\n\nECONOMIES WITH PARALLEL EXCHANGE MARKETS   \n\n \n\n \n\n  a model\n\nof the macroeconomic response to a monetary shock in an externally-dependent\n\neconomy with a black market for foreign exchange.\n A model of the currency substitution genre is used to describe how\n\nmonetary signals may be transmitted through a black market rate and the\n\nsupply side of the economy to real output.\n The model demonstrates that monetary contraction may have an\n\nexpansionary supply-side influence, and that this effect is stronger in the\n\nmore dependent economies.\n The model also shows that devaluation is not neutral with respect\n\nto the black market premium.  \n\n \n\n  The purpose of this paper is to develop a model of macroeconomic\n\nbehaviour for a structuralist economy with a black market for foreign\n\nexchange.\n The structuralist characteristic of interest is the dependence of the\n\nproduction structure in developing economies on imported intermediate inputs.\n The distinguishing feature of the treatment is the consideration of\n\nblack markets within a complete macroeconomic framework with an independent\n\nsupply side.\n The model demonstrates that expansionary money may exert a brief\n\ncontractionary influence on output in externally dependent economies with\n\nblack markets, before any long run expansionary impact is felt.\n This result, based on differential rates of adjustment in goods and\n\nasset markets, undercuts those of structuralist models of credit-constrained\n\noutput.\n The model shows also that a nominal devaluation can be contractionary\n\nand is not neutral with respect to the black market premium. \n\n  The focus of the analysis is the transmission of monetary signals\n\nto the real economy.\n Much has been written on the transmission of such signals via the\n\nunofficial credit ( or  " curb"  ) market.  \n 1. See Bruno ( 1979), Taylor ( 1981 and 1983), Porter and Ranney (\n\n1982), van Wijnbergen ( 1983 and 1986), and Buffie ( 1984). \n Because of poor state of financial intermediation in developing\n\neconomies, and in particular, the inadequacy of markets for equity as well as\n\nofficial limits placed on commercial bank credit, firms face a credit\n\nconstraint in the financing of working capital for production.\n Changes in the money supply can affect output via the availability of\n\ncommercial credit as well as through changes in the interest rate being\n\ncharged in the unorganized money market.\n It will be shown below that the exchange rate regime, in particular,\n\nthe presence of a parallel exchange market, introduces a transmission\n\nmechanism that can act counter to this supply-side credit effect. \n\n  The analytical content of this paper has a dual heritage,\n\nhowever.\n In addition to being a response to the new structuralists and their\n\nworking capital constraint, in modeling the transmission of monetary signals\n\nin the presence of a black market this work is a methodological descendent of\n\nthe black market literature.  \n 2. For a sampling, see Macedo ( 1982), Dornbusch ( 1983), Lizondo (\n\n1987), and the articles summarised in the following paragraphs. \n The specific mechanism highlighted in this chapter, via the black\n\nmarket and the supply side, has largely been ignored in that literature\n\nbecause of inadequate treatment of the real side.\n Aizenmann ( 1985), for example, has previously examined\n\nadjustment to monetary shocks and devaluation under a dual exchange rate\n\nregime.\n He shows that a black market exchange rate will rise in response to\n\nmonetary expansion.\n\n\nequilibrium   setting, however, and his concern is with the\n\nperformance of the current account and how it compares to the single fixed\n\nexchange rate case.\n\n\n  Cumby\'s ( 1984) analysis of monetary policy in a black market\n\neconomy is conducted in a general equilibrium context.\n He shows that an expansion of the domestic money supply, even if\n\nwealth does not increase initially, raises the black market rate.\n The depreciation of the black market rate itself creates a wealth\n\neffect and consequent increase in aggregate demand. \n\n  Nowak ( 1984) uses the Kouri stock/flow portfolio balance\n\nformulation, also in a general equilibrium context, and analyses the effect\n\nof both money growth and devaluation, largely on the price level and black\n\nmarket exchange rate.\n Output is demand determined by relative prices in the devaluation\n\nexercises, but his analysis of monetary changes assumes fixed output.\n\n\n\n  The analysis below explicitly addresses the issue skirted by\n\nthese works - how money affects the real economy in a black market or dual\n\nexchange market regime.\n The framework employed is a simple general equilibrium model with a\n\ngoods market and two financial assets.\n The financial assets ( a domestic and a foreign asset) are modeled as\n\nportfolio balances.  \n 3. See Kouri ( 1976) for a general portfolio balance formulation.\n\n\n The economy has an official fixed exchange rate and a second (\n\nhigher) black market rate, and current transactions occur in both exchange\n\nmarkets.\n\n\n  The structure of the paper is as follows.\n The basic model is constructed in the next section.\n In section 2, exercises are conducted to trace the effects of\n\nexogenous shifts in policy variables.\n The polices examined are a higher level of the nominal money stock\n\nand a devaluation of the official exchange rate.\n In the final section, it is shown that the temporary contractionary\n\neffect of monetary expansion varies positively with the degree of external\n\ndependence in the economy. \n\n \n\n \n\n  A salient feature of production in LDC\'s is its external\n\ndependence.\n Production, particularly of manufacturers, requires the use of\n\nintermediate inputs not produced domestically.\n The elasticity of substitution with respect to these imported\n\nintermediate inputs and raw materials versus domestic inputs is low.\n Even in the long run, with capital and therefore the technology of\n\nproduction variable, the choice of production technique is limited\n\nbecause even the technology is imported, and therefore embodies the factor\n\nendowments of an industrial economy.\n Consequently, output is specified as a function of imported (\n\n&Ntilde;) and domestic ( L) inputs.\n Production is governed by a concave Leontief technology of the\n\nfollowing form \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nthat the world price of imports and exports ( P &asterisk;) is given.\n A firm buys as much of its imported inputs as possible at the lower\n\nofficial rate ( e  o  , expressed in  " pesos"  per\n\n " dollar"  ) , the amount determined by the prevailing rules\n\nof the central bank limiting sales of official reserves.\n Firms then purchase dollars on the black market ( at rate e) to\n\nprocure the remainder of their imported inputs.\n o\n\n P &asterisk; for the share bought at the official rate and eP\n\n&asterisk; for inputs obtained with  " black market dollars"  .\n Notwithstanding the presence of official currency\n\ninconvertibility, firms can obtain as much foreign exchange as they need at\n\nthe prevailing parallel exchange rate.\n Domestic inputs are bought at a nominal price of w, hereafter\n\nreferred to as  " wages"  . \n\n  Profit maximisation using the production function of equation 1,\n\nand normalisation of world prices, yields an output function on the following\n\nform. \n\n Y=Y(e/P,w/P) ( 2) \n\n  Wages are flexible and there is no money illusion, so real wages\n\n( w/P) adjust instantly to clear the labour market.\n The wage rate can therefore be expressed as a function of the\n\nexchange rate, output price, and labour market conditions.\n For this reason, the wage term is omitted from subsequent appearances\n\nof the supply function.\n The supply of goods therefore varies inversely with the nominal ( and\n\nreal) exchange rate, and positively with the price level.  \n 4. As long as the constraint imposed by the limited availability of\n\nforeign exchange at the official rate is effective, that is, as long as the\n\nfirm is forced to buy some foreign exchange at the parallel rate, then the\n\nofficial rate does not appear in the supply function since the marginal cost\n\nof imported inputs is the parallel rate.  \n\n  Demand for the output of the economy is the sum of domestic\n\nconsumption ( C) and exports ( X).\n\n\n 5   \n includes only income from the provision\n\nof domestic inputs, and does not include discounted income from the ownership\n\nof assets. \n\n\n \n\n \n\n  On the monetary side, wealth-holders apportion their wealth\n\nbetween a foreign and a domestic asset.\n The foreign asset is black market hard currency, henceforth referred\n\nto as  " dollars"  .  \n 6. Private foreign asset holdings in Latin America are indeed largely\n\nheld as money.\n The most common holdings are U.S. currency in a local safety deposit\n\nbox or a checking account in Miami.  \n The domestic asset is a fixed-interest-bearing security,\n\nrepresentative of and encompassing the range of domestic assets actually\n\navailable, including money. \n\n \n\n 7   \n 7. Since the focus is on the speculative portfolio, we ignore the\n\nminimum- variance portfolio by assuming that asset-holders are risk-neutral.\n\n\n The portfolio mix is determined, in general, by the interest rate\n\ndifferential and the expected rate of depreciation of the exchange rate.\n\n\nd  ) can therefore be stated as follows. \n\n\n 8. We use the wealth identity introduced below to eliminate the\n\n " n\'th"  asset market equilibirium equation, so we explicitly\n\nmodel only the asset market for foreign currency.  \n\n \n\n  is the fraction of wealth ( W) that is held in the\n\nforeign asset; &pi; is the expected rate of change of the parallel exchange\n\nrate;  is the foreign ( domestic) interest rate.  \n 9. The absence of Y from the asset demand equation requires a\n\ncomment.\n may include demand deposits\n\nand bonds, both issued by the banking sector.\n Households would satisfy a change in their transactions demand for\n\nmoney by shifting between demand deposits and bonds.\n But this would not affect the distribution of their portfolio between\n\ndomestic and foreign assets, which by assumption is affected only by changes\n\nin relative rates of return.\n For this reason, Y does not appear as an argument in the asset demand\n\nequations. \n Nominal private wealth, W, is identically equal to the sum of the\n\nnominal stock of ( high-powered) money ( M) and the domestic value of private\n\nforeign exchange holdings ( e.F, where F is the privately-held stock of\n\nforeign exchange).\n Foreign asset holdings are evaluated at the parallel rate since that\n\nis the rate on marginal transactions.\n Because much of foreign asset holdings are indeed held as\n\nnon-interest bearing money ( all of it, by assumption here) and because we\n\nassume that domestic monetary authorities control interest rates, the\n\ninterest terms become parametric and are omitted from subsequent appearances\n\nof the foreign asset demand equation.\n In this respect, the model is in the spirit of the currency\n\nsubstitution framework.  \n 10. The defining characteristic of currency substitution models is\n\nthat the yield on the assets in the portfolio, usually monies, are not\n\nfunctions of the value of the asset, as is the case with bonds.\n For the general theoretical treatment of currency substitution, see\n\nGirton and Roper ( 1981).\n For previous black market applications of the framework, see Macedo (\n\n1982) and Dornbusch et al.

and involves subjective considerations\n\nas well as  " awareness of external reality"  .\n The range of choice also influences the process which can be depicted\n\nin stages, with fantasy choices being made at an early age ( about 11 years),\n\ntentative choices made at about age 17, and more realistic choices being made\n\nlater after exposure to the work itself. \n\n  Ginzburg et al developed a general theory without reference to\n\nany specific occupation.\n Their conclusions were based on case studies of a cross section of\n\nyoung American adults.\n The theory was shaped by the responses of upper class young men, with\n\nwomen and lower income young men treated as variations.\n The dynamics of decision making may operate differently in specific\n\noccupations and in different social and cultural contexts.\n In such cases some variables may be more salient in decision making\n\nthan others. \n\n  Teaching as an occupation has some special features which may\n\nmake the choice process unique.\n For example, most if not all persons in a society become aware of\n\nteaching as an occupation by virtue of their compulsory attendance at school.\n If an awareness of the occupation is an important factor as Ginzburg\n\net al contend, then teaching is a special occupation.\n In addition, teaching appeals to that desire to correct and improve,\n\nwhich Stephens ( 1969) claims the human race developed as a means of survival\n\nand which can in some individuals develop into a sense of mission.\n In his evolutionary account of the origins of basic pedagogical\n\ntendencies, Stephens argues that human beings have survived because of these\n\ndeeply ingrained impulses which are lived out naturally in classrooms and\n\nfamilies.\n Thirdly, by virtue of an extended exposure to teachers and teaching,\n\nstudents may come to perceive the occupation as having certain qualities\n\nwhich they consider attractive.\n For example, the teacher may conceivably be seen as one who exercises\n\npower, authority or control over others, or one who is kind and loving, or\n\none who imparts knowledge to others.\n lives,\n\nhe or she is capable of exercising indirect influence on one\'s early\n\nidentification with or even choice of teaching as an occupation.\n Indeed, students may view becoming a teacher as one way of becoming\n\nlike a " significant other" in their lives. \n\n  Research on the sociolization of teachers suggests that these\n\nearly experiences are very powerful and enduring, and often do influence  decisions to become a teacher ( Lortie 1975, Goodlad 1984).\n Research also suggests that new recruits to teaching view teaching as\n\neasy and requiring little specialized learning ( Book, Byers and Freeman,\n\n1983).\n The teacher\'s nurturing, interpersonal and caring qualities, which no\n\ndoubt have great effect on them as students, become salient in their\n\nconception of teaching ( Weinstein 1989).\n Though this line of research in socialization seeks to identify\n\nsources of dispositions, models of teaching and other pedagogical tendencies,\n\nwe can deduce from this research some special features of teaching which\n\nserve to attract the young. \n\n \n\ntural contexts invite special examination.\n In non-industrialized countries for example, there may exist a\n\nnarrow range of choices with respect to the number of occupations that exist.\n The individual in these countries may have a narrow range of choice\n\nbecause of lack of information or because of the absence of the financial or\n\neducational qualifications which provide access to the particular occupation.\n In such cases, early influences and decisions taken at what Ginzburg\n\net al call the fantasy stage may have greater salience than in other\n\ncountries in which the individual has a wide range of choice, or where\n\noccupational counselling is available.\n And factors which ease one\'s entry to an occupation such as\n\navailability of scholarships or free tuition for the required training, may\n\nexercise a strong influence on one\'s occupational choice. \n\n \n\n  Jamaica is an interesting country for the study of the choice of\n\nteaching as an occupation.\n Up to the 1960s, and even about a decade after independence in 1962,\n\nthe commercial sector grew slowly and new categories of jobs were established\n\ninfrequently.\n Colonialist attitudes restricted the access of the majority of black\n\nJamaicans - male and female - to jobs in the commercial and tourism sectors.\n Many of the relatively small percentage of students who graduated\n\nfrom the elementary school ( the school for the masses), or who obtained the\n\nthen third Jamaica Local Examination, entered teaching.\n Teaching was regarded as an attractive occupation for both men and\n\nwomen alike.\n In small rural communities and urban centres, the teacher and the\n\nminister were the respectable leaders in the community. ( Goulbourne 1988 p.\n\n73-6). \n\n  Blocked access to alternative occupations and the high status of\n\nthe teaching profession at that time only partly explain the importance of\n\nteaching as an occupational choice then.\n Access to a secondary education was even more limited than it is now,\n\nwith only about 2% of the graduates of the elementary school being admitted\n\nto secondary high schools in 1948 ( King, cited in Evans 1991).\n Consequently, the teacher colleges were often used as a means of\n\ngaining a secondary education by the sons and daughters of the black popula\n\n<l> tion.\n Teacher colleges came to be known as the black man\'s high school.\n\n\n\n  Since the 1970s there has been an expansion of occupations in the\n\ncommercial and tourism sectors.\n New jobs in computer programming, personnel administration and\n\ntraining have been created.\n At the same time, this expansion has created additional openings in\n\nareas such as banking and insurance.\n These new positions have acquired a certain status, associated with\n\nwhat is  \'modern\'  .\n They provide attractive alternatives to teaching as a career for\n\ngraduates of secondary education or of the teachers colleges.\n The status of teaching has also declined partly because of its\n\nunfavourable comparison with these new occupations, but also because of\n\nwhat many see as changes in student characteristics and a deterioration in\n\nworking conditions.\n This change has affected teacher recruitment, retention and\n\nsatisfaction in other countries ( e.g., Schlecty and Vance 1983,\n\nFeiman-Nemser and Floden 1986).\n In Jamaica, limited research ( Coke 1990) and anecdotal reports\n\nindicate that teachers are disenchanted with  behaviour,\n\nlack of  \'discipline\'  and their learning and achievement.\n Harsh conditions and at times the absence of equipment and resources,\n\nespecially in the all-age and primary schools, have reduced the\n\nattractiveness and the status of teaching.\n salaries have not kept pace\n\nwith the rapidly rising cost of living.\n All these factors have operated to make teaching a less automatic\n\nchoice than it was twenty or thirty years ago. \n\n  The consequence of this altered situation has been a recent\n\nreduction in the number of applicants to the teachers colleges and the flight\n\nof experienced teachers from the profession.\n For although there was an increased demand for teachers during the\n\n1960s as a result of the government\'s policy of expanding educational\n\nopportunities, there has since 1980 been a drastic reduction in the number of\n\ncandidates admitted to colleges.\n For example, in 1979, 1,628 students were admitted to eight colleges.\n This figure was reduced to 728 in 1981, when higher qualifications\n\nfor entry were introduced, increased to 965 in 1985 and later reduced to 640\n\nin 1990 ( JBTE Annual Statistics, 1979, 1981, 1985, 1990.)\n ( Data for four of the colleges have been omitted because these\n\ncolleges were either established after 1979 or ceased functioning prior to\n\n1990.) \n\n \n\ntive route to a tertiary education.\n The teachers college programmes are used as the equivalent of grades\n\n12 and 13 of the traditional high school, and graduates gain automatic\n\nmatriculation to the University of the West Indies.\n For the candidate who wants to gain admission to the University, the\n\nteachers college may be seen as an attractive alternative to grades 12 and 13\n\nof the high school, since the failure rate in the A\'level exams sat at the\n\nend of grade 13 is very high.\n Thus many young secondary level school graduates have a strong\n\nincentive for attending the teachers college, though it is not clear that\n\nthey all intend to become teachers. \n\n \n\n  Given this background, it became important to discover why those\n\nwho enter teaching decide to do so.\n What from among the many factors cited by Ginzburg et al was most\n\ninfluential?\n " every &dotted-line; decision &dotted-line; is a\n\ncombination of internal and external factors"  , ( Ginzburg et al p.\n\n16) and since in Jamaica there are internal and external factors that can be\n\nconsidered equally powerful, which ones exercised the greatest influence?\n\n\n\n  We sought to identify these reasons and influences through\n\nopen-ended items included in a questionnaire developed as part of a larger\n\nstudy which examined the impact of the teacher education programme of the\n\nJamaican teachers colleges.  \n 1. The study of the impact of the teacher education programme was\n\nconceived by Professors Lilian Katz of the University of Illinois - Urbana\n\nand Jim Raths of the University of Delaware who also helped in the\n\ndevelopment of the questionnaire.\n Data were collected and analyzed by the author and Dr. Monica Brown\n\nof the University of the West Indies.\n The contribution of these persons is gratefully acknowledged.\n\n \n\n \n\n  This study combined ethnographic and survey research methods.\n The sample consisted of all the 1989 graduates of ten of eleven\n\nteachers colleges and departments in Jamaica.\n The 21-item questionnaire, which sought to examine the impact of the\n\nteacher education programme, included questions related to problems\n\nexperienced, the use of knowledge learned in college, and the college courses\n\nwhich were most useful.\n The questionnaire was mailed to the graduates during the second\n\nsemester of the 1989-90 academic year while they were or should have been in\n\ntheir first year of teaching.  \n <ICE-JA::2. Many of those who graduate from the t eachers colleges do not in\n\nfact enter teaching.\n\n\n\n\n  The number of these graduates in 1989 was 270.\n Twenty of the respondents from four of the fourteen parishes were\n\nchosen at random for indepth interviewing.\n During the interviews, additional probes were used where necessary.\n The two items included in the questionnaire and on the interview\n\nschedule which pertain to choice of teaching were: \n\n  1. What is the main reason why you chose to become a teacher?\n\n\n\n \n\n  These two questions, it was felt, would elicit the primary and\n\nsecondary reasons which prompted them to make this occupational choice.\n\n\n\n  A total of 108 first year teachers or 40.0% of the sample\n\nresponded to the questionnaire.\n Responses were analyzed for each question and coded according to the\n\ncategories and themes which emerged.\n Categories were combined and refined during analysis until a\n\nmanageable number of categories was evident.\n The number and percentages of those whose responses fell within a\n\ncategory were then calculated.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '61f34e46-526f-4abc-b4c7-648e50356aeb', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.344793+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9745439291000366, 'non_english_score': 0.02545607089996338}
{'text': '( 1)\n\n is to develop a political dialogue with my students in Caribbean\n\nPolitical Thought and my own children who were born in the mid-1970s.\n\n\n ( 1) This essay forms part of a study on Walter Rodney ( 1942-1980)\n\nwho best represented the tradition of scholarship and political activism in\n\nthe Caribbean and Africa.\n He was assassinated by the regime of the late President Forbes Burnham\n\nof Guyana in 1980 when only 38 years old.\n For other sources on Rodney see Alpers and Fontaine ( 1982), Kwayana (\n\n1988), Rodney ( 1990) and Gibbons ( 1994).\n For analyses of the 1968 protests by University students and others\n\nagainst the ban on Rodney see Girvan ( 1968) and Gonsalves ( 1979).\n\n\n The biographical format adopted tries to facilitate this method of\n\nanalysis so that readers are aware of some of the personalities with whom\n\nRodney interacted, the choices made, the negations, affirmations, the\n\nerrors, the ideas and activism in their social, economic and political\n\ncontext. \n\n  I intend to revisit Rodney\'s political activism in 1968 within the\n\ncontext of a pre-existing social movement in Jamaican urban communities of\n\nthe poor that were very heavily influenced by Rastafarianism.\n Rodney\'s expulsion by the Jamaican government was based on fears that\n\nhis interaction with the leading figures at the grass-roots could lead to the\n\nemergence of a radical political ideology taking hold among them and that\n\ninstability would ensue if such a political movement became an oppositional\n\nforce threatening the political system of independent Jamaica that was barely\n\nsix years old.\n The possibility of a link between the intellectuals and the\n\nmasses seemed to be a source of paranoia in the ruling Jamaica Labour Party,\n\nbut so far no hard evidence of Rodney trying to overthrow the Jamaican\n\ngovernment has emerged.\n What emerges is hostility by the political elite to black nationalism\n\ncoupled with cold war anti-communism, and narrow-minded Jamaican\n\nnationalism which portrayed Rodney as a foreigner from Guyana who was\n\ninterfering in national politics.\n\n\ncal elite.\n The latter feared more than anything else that Rodney could give some\n\ncoherence to the disparate expressions of resistance to the political\n\nstatus quo and for them it was a question of either squashing that type of\n\ncriticism or in the case of the People\'s National Party, then in\n\nparliamentary opposition, co-opting and subordinating it politically.\n\n\n \n\n  Rodney came to embody the aspirations of politically aware young\n\npeople from the middle and lower classes who were alienated socially,\n\neconomically and politically.\n People saw in Rodney qualities they admired.\n He was well-educated, well-informed, articulate, yet different from\n\nhis peers in ways that were personal and ideological.\n The clues to Rodney\'s appeal may be found not simply in the status\n\nderived from his academic achievements, but in his personal conduct, ability\n\nto connect history and contemporary politics, and his articulateness.\n He was not an intellectual posturer, neither did he use his immense\n\nknowledge of Africa  and the Caribbean to show off his\n\nbrilliance but helped to clarify the past and challenge the interpretations\n\nof colonial and bourgeois historians. \n A History of the Upper Guinea\n\nCoast 1545-1800.

Jamaica campus one night after dinner early in 1968.\n I was then in the final year of my undergraduate degree.\n Winston Davis, who had travelled to Cuba, was walking towards his\n\nsub-warden flat in Chancellor Hall when Walter accosted him,  "\n\nWinston, what\'s happening man?\n\n They greeted each other warmly and as I was then passing on the way\n\nto my room Winston introduced me to Walter and was somewhat surprised that I\n\nhad never heard of him.\n Winston Davis had a reputation as an outstanding Spanish teacher and\n\nhad taught me at Calabar High School.\n He was also doing research on Cuban literature under the\n\ndistinguished Latin-American scholar at U.W.I., Professor Gabriel Coulthard.\n Because of his visit to Cuba and his activities in the Young\n\nSocialist League of PNP left-wingers, he was under surveillance by the\n\nSpecial Branch of the Jamaican police. \n The mid- sixties had seen him making decisions that resulted in his\n\nrejection of much of what was considered conventional West Indian\n\nmiddle-class values - the striving for status, the distancing from one\'s\n\nsocial background, the imitation of an English accent, the marrying of\n\nan English wife or marrying what was considered the next best, a\n\nlight-skinned woman.\n Rodney never embraced a conventional West Indian middle-class\n\nlife-style and the politics that went with it because he chose not to and was\n\ncomfortable with that decision. \n\n  Political attraction to or repulsion from a personality is often\n\nbased on very small personal things.\n The fact that his education had not alienated him made a big\n\nimpression on students in the 1960s because he was setting an example that\n\nwas so unlike the posturing and radical chic behaviour of some campus\n\nradicals.\n Rodney was of average height and had the look of a 1960\'s black\n\nradical though unexaggeratedly so.\n He wore dashikis, had an Afro hair style and a slight beard.\n Pat, his wife, wore a low haircut and dressed in African print wraps.\n In the past the Mona campus had grown accustomed to the brightest\n\nyoung black male intellectuals returning from London with their Ph.Ds\n\nand white wives.\n This had been the expectation but the existence of a vibrant\n\nUniversity and the growing number of female students widened male spouse\n\noptions.\n The relationship students and friends observed between Walter\n\nand Pat seemed very healthy.\n She travelled with him whenever she had time off from her job as\n\na nurse at the University Hospital and she took their son Shaka on the rural\n\ntrips.\n Pat was very fascinated by Jamaica, how beautiful it was.\n " there are two sides to Jamaica\n\nand I will show you both sides"  ( Pat Rodney 1989).\n Walter introduced her to the two Jamaicas and this left a very deep\n\nimpression on her mind \n\n  Because Walter took me down to Trench Town and I met a\n\nlot of his friends.\n I saw the poverty, I saw the other side of Jamaica.\n It upset me a lot because I saw people rummaging through\n\ndustbins.\n But Walter said he never wanted me to get a false image at any time\n\nof wherever we lived, or what life was really like for the majority of the\n\npeople  ( Pat Rodney 1989) \n\n  He was a well-educated black man who was very comfortable in a\n\nsocial sense around ordinary people and so was Pat.\n There seemed to be some congruence between his personal and political\n\nideals.\n\n\n  His decision to live off campus was deliberate as he loathed what\n\nhe perceived as the philistinism of those of his colleagues whose lives\n\nrevolved almost exclusively around the lecture-room, laboratories, libraries,\n\nstudents, other lecturers and the Senior Common Room bar. \n\n\n ( 4) At a party at his home which I attended, in the newly built\n\nmiddle class neighbourhood of Trafalgar Park, in March 1968 there were more\n\nRastafarians and ghetto youth than students from campus. \n He lived in Trafalgar Park, then a newly built middle-class suburb\n\nfrom which he re-acquainted himself with the  " dungles" \n\n of Kingston that Orlando Patterson had portrayed so\n\ntellingly in his 1964 novel  The Children of Sisyphus  . \n ( 5) Patterson used the common Jamaican terminology " "\n\ndungles" " in his novel  Children of Sisyphus  .\n " " Dungles" " combines " \'dung ( heap)\'\n\n" and " \'jungle\' " and can be used interchangeably\n\nwith " " slums" " or " " ghettoes" " .\n\n\n But for Rodney, unlike Orlando Patterson, the struggle was not seen\n\nin terms of the Sisyphean myth but from the standpoint that the people of the\n\n \'dungle\'  had to become their own liberators. \n\n  Rodney\'s impact on young people is evident in Robin ( Jerry)\n\nSmall\'s first encounter with him in early 1968. \n\n  and I think\n\nMichael ( Poco) Morgan  told me that there was this young\n\nhistory teacher who just come from Africa and who was very interested in the\n\nliberation struggles. \n ( 6) Dr Peter Phillips, a U.W.I.-trained political scientist became\n\nin the 1990s a parlamentarian and a member of the cabinet of Prime Minister\n\nP.J. Patterson.\n ( 7) Michael Morgan later worked with UN international agencies in\n\nTanzania in the 1980s. \n He had a lot of personal contact with the liberation struggle in\n\nAfrica and had contacts with the O.A.U.\n They arranged for me to meet him.\n I think it was around by the History department one day, Peter\n\ncarried me around there and I met this small man, Walter Rodney, and I was\n\nstruck you know, the smallness of his features, almost a kind of little boy\n\nlook, not looking really hard and tough and aloof  ( Small 1989).\n\n\n\n  and Peter Phillips\n\nformed the core of a group of Jamaica College radicals from middle class back\n\n<l> grounds who became Rastafarians. \n ( 8) Garth White is a talented musicologist who is an expert on\n\nJamaican popular music. \n They were bright, articulate, and rebellious.\n Robin Small\'s alienation from his own family, which was one of\n\nJamaica\'s most prominent black professional families, mirrored a sense of\n\ndisquiet with racial prejudice and social oppression in Jamaica among\n\nsections of the middle class.\n Robin was the younger brother of Hugh Small, a well-known lawyer and\n\nthe key figure in the Young Socialist League which housed the People\'s\n\nNational Party\'s left-wing.\n Richard Small was another brother who was a close friend of Rodney\'s\n\nand his lawyer in the 1979-1980 arson trial in Guyana.\n Walter had met Richard in Leningrad in 1962 and they had been members\n\nof the C.L.R. James study group in London in the early 1960s.\n Walter later developed a close relationship with Robin Small who had\n\nleadership qualities.\n Among his peers Robin was the most articulate and widely read,\n\nand was very determined to pursue his own way of being, shunning his middle-\n\nclass upbringing and halting his own education past high school in an act of\n\nrebellion which led him to immerse himself into Rastafarianism and Twelve\n\nTribes  and radically change his life-style. \n ( 9) A grouping within the Rastafarian movement that was influential\n\nin the 1970s and developed its own organizational form and rituals and\n\nattracted the adherence of popular reggae singers such as Bob Marley.\n\n\n He became a dreadlocks and lived in the communities of the poor\n\nto the dismay of his family. \n\n  (\n\n10)  call for  \'Black Man time Now\'  at Independence,\n\nthe appointment of Clifford Campbell, a rural school teacher, as the first\n\nBlack Jamaican to be chosen as Governor General, the 1963 bus strike, the\n\nstrike at the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation in 1963, \n\nthe formation of the Organisation of African Unity in 1963 and the Coral\n\nGardens incident, discussed below, of the same year. \n ( 10) Millard Johnson was a Garveyite who tried to build a party\n\nsupporting the principles of Garvey\'s People\'s Political Party in the period\n\n1929-30.\n Johnson\'s attempt in the early 1960s to resurrect the P.P.P. was not\n\nsuccessful but he reflected the sentiment among sections of the\n\nAfrican-Jamaican population that the Jamaican white and mulatto elite wanted\n\nan independence that did not disturb their privileged positions so that\n\nracial discrimination in public and private institutions as well as in social\n\nlife would be swept under the carpet.\n While sympathetic to the Rastafarians, Johnson was not an adherent.\n A businessman himself, he reflected the aspirations of the black\n\nmiddle-class and entrepreneurs.\n After leaving Jamaica he lived for many years in the United States\n\nand Tanzania.\n See comment on Millard Johnson in Gray ( 1991, 60).\n ( 11) The strike at the Government-owned Jamaica Broadcasting is\n\ndiscussed at length by Manley ( 1975).\n It was an important milestone in the development of the struggle for\n\n rights, particularly middle-strata workers, and in Michael\n\nManley\'s trade union and political life.  \n\n\n  were very introspective and very reflective about black\n\npeople situation and Jamaica&dotted-line;\n But especially after independence when the high expectations of\n\neverybody was being tested, young people like ourselves 13, 14, 15 and 16\n\nwere starting to realise that this independence wasn\'t really living up to\n\nblack people expectations  ( Robin Small 1989)', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '84cfdd11-72ed-4878-b7c1-416b1161f74a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.346163+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9808182120323181, 'non_english_score': 0.019181787967681885}

political activities. \n CLR James, The Artist as Revolutionary\n\n , Verso, London, 1988. \n James had at least five objectives in mind.\n First, the successful Haitian revolutionary struggle was to be used\n\nas a tool to teach a new generation of anti-colonialists, particularly on the\n\nAfrican continent that it was possible for black people to free themselves.\n Second, James hoped to expose what he saw as the machinations of the\n\ncolonial/imperial powers as a means of providing the anti- colonial movement\n\nwith a guide and a warning as to what to look out for and avoid in the\n\nimmigrant struggles.\n Third, while using a West Indian study to draw lessons for the\n\nAfrican continent, he also sought to highlight the peculiar role of the West\n\nIndies in world history and to identify the unique contribution of a\n\ncertain  West Indianness   in the making of the\n\nHaitian Revolution. \n ( 6) This is a subliminal theme throughout the study, but is made\n\nexplicit in his seminal appendix  From Toussaint L\'Ouverture to Fidel\n\nCastro  , in which he makes his case - often repeated, but seldom with\n\nas much force - for a distinct West Indian nation.\n\n Fourth, he sought to explore the characteristics and dynamics of\n\nRevolution,  sui generis  as a nodal moment in the historical\n\nprocess.\n And fifth, he sought to demonstrate the usefulness and\n\neffectiveness of a certain interpretation of marxist methodology in the\n\nanalysis and understanding of history. \n\n  If the book was not, perhaps, as widely read among the leaders\n\nand followers of the political movements he hoped to inspire it,\n\nnevertheless, with its heroic portrayal of the San Domingo  blacks did, and continues to, inspire many. \n , instead\n\nof the now more commonly accepted  " St Domingue"  .\n This may have been his attempt to translate the territory\'s colonial\n\nname for the reader unaccustomed to French. \n The Black Jacobins\n\n has served as an important part of that broad array of texts and\n\ntheories, myths and cultural artifacts which together constitute the \n\n" imagined community"  of modern West Indian and beyond it, Pan\n\nAfrican nationalism and, from the perspective of its times, suggested the\n\npossibility of an independent future, even as it sought to understand the\n\ntwists and turns of the tortured past.  \n Imagined

heart.\n methodology, which in form and stated intent is\n\nclearly marxist, nevertheless follows its own peculiar trajectory.\n What is the jamesian method?\n How does it differ from other contemporary marxist schools?\n How does this affect his conclusions?\n And, how can we better understand his overall intellectual direction\n\nfrom this?\n This essay hopes to begin to answer, though it makes no pretensions\n\nin its ability to exhaust, these questions. \n\n  If one looks at the critical debate in and around the marxist\n\ntradition in the mid to late Twentieth Century, a surprisingly large part of\n\nit is devoted, not only to the  \'correct\'  interpretation of\n\nthis or that historical event or period, but more specifically to the\n\nmethodology used to interpret history.\n ( 9)\n\n generated by Thompson\'s path breaking use of social history in \n\nThe Making of the English Working Class  ; The acerbic critique of\n\nAlthusser\'s  \'structural marxism\'  by

economic or productive\n\nforces, or on  \'superstructural\'  elements, including race,\n\nreligion, political factors and, most critically, human agency.\n Indeed, the wider debate has been given permanent fuel by Marx and\n\nEngels themselves, with their glaring silences on questions of the state,\n\npolitics and historical analysis - the famous absence of Marx\'s theory of\n\npolitics.  \n ,

is\n\npossible to suggest at least three distinct approaches to the relationship\n\nbetween base and superstructure in Marx and Engels.\n ,\n\nPolitics is strictly subordinate to economics.\n ,\n\nPolitics is autonomous of the base in unique historical circumstances.\n In the third, probably more typical of the younger, post-hegelian\n\nMarx, politics is always relatively autonomous from the productive base.\n These issues are never really resolved and as good an attempt as any\n\nis provided by Callinicos and Anderson  who, separately,\n\nsuggest that the extent of human intervention varies depending on the\n\nparticular epoch. \n\n Thus, over the last two hundred years, the pendulum has swung in\n\nfavour of agency and away from determination by the productive base. \n\n  If the collapse of the Berlin Wall signalled the end of a certain\n\nmodel of  \'socialism\'  it also signalled an explosion in the\n\ndebate on the relevance of marxist analysis.  \n The Retreat of\n\nthe

{'text': 'MEASUREMENTS OF RADIOACTIVITY IN JAMAICAN BUILDING\n\nMATERIALS AND &gamma; DOSE EQUIVALENTS IN A PROTOTYPE RED MUD HOUSE \n\n \n\n \n\n  Department of Chemistry, University of the West Indies, Mona\n\nCampus, Kingston 7, Jamaica \n\n  -\n 40\n\n K measured in bauxite waste, local building materials, and soils are\n\npresented and used in model equations to estimate the effective &gamma;\n\ndose-equivalent increments over background in the center of a standard-sized\n\nroom in a prototype house.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  JAMAICAN bauxite and its process waste, red mud, are known to\n\ncontain levels of  238  U and  232  Th that are sig <l>\n\nnificantly greater than those found in most other local soils.\n This was confirmed ( Pinnock and Graham 1988) in measurements that\n\nwere carried out as part of an effort to characterize the waste. One of the\n\npotential uses of red mud noted in the characterization studies is its use in\n\nconstructing buildings.\n The material binds together strongly in its natural dry state, even\n\nwithout the addition of binders, and can be used to produce a building block\n\nthat looks very similar to a traditional red clay brick.\n Questions about radiation hazards to building occupants have prompted\n\nthis study of the radiation characteristics of red mud when used as a\n\nbuilding material. \n\n  Since it is the increment of dose above background that is the\n\nappropriate basis for judging the hazard involved in using the material\n\n( ICRP 1984), measurements are required of the activity present, not only in\n\nred mud, but also in other materials that are normally used for con <l>\n\nstruction purposes.\n\n\nK form the primary basis for such a hazard assessment; thus, they were\n\ndetermined in some relevant materials.\n\n\n  As a further step in evaluating the radiation hazard, effective\n\n&gamma; dose equivalents were deduced from measurements made in a\n\nprototype house constructed with red mud blocks.\n Dose-equivalent calculations were also made using the measured\n\nradionuclide activities by employing model equations and appropriate values\n\nfor constants derived from the literature.\n This was done as a test for the usefulness of these model equations\n\nwhen predicting doses, with a view to use such equations more generally in\n\ndeducing appropriate limits for radioactivity in building material.\n The results of measurement and calculation are presented and\n\ndiscussed below. \n\n \n\n  A &gamma;-ray spectrometer with a 7.5- x 7.5-cm sodium iodide\n\ndetector was used for the measurements.\n\n\ntroscopy amplifier, and pulse-height analysis and accumulation of\n\nspectra were performed using a 1024-channel personal computer analyzer board,\n\nPCA-1000,  in an IBM personal computer.  \n\n IBM Inc., Sales and Services, Boca Raton, FL.\n\n \n\n  Th activities were determined from\n\ncounts obtained in two regions of the spectra of samples, shown as regions I\n\nand II in Fig. 1, where the radionuclides and their progenies gave relatively\n\nhigh count rates.\n In region I ( 280 to 370 keV) the main contributing nuclide is\n\n 214  Pb with peaks at 295 and 352 keV, but there is some\n\ninterference from  228  Ac at 328 and 338 keV and  212  Pb\n\nat 300 keV.\n In region II ( 225 to 270 keV), but there is a small contribution\n\nfrom  214  Pb is the main contributor through its peak at 239 keV,\n\nbut there is a small contribution from  214  Pb through its peak at\n\n242 keV.\n The situation is given in more detail in Table 1, where the origin of\n\nthe various &gamma; rays that occur and their decay intensities are given.\n The interference in the region of interest from other radionuclides\n\nwas estimated using data from standard radionuclide sources, and counts\n\nin each region of interest were corrected accordingly.   \n\n  Background was subtracted by extrapolating the trend from higher\n\nenergies, as shown by the dotted line in Fig. 1.\n The accuracy of this procedure was verified and refined by plotting\n\ncorrected counts against known activities of standards for each region.\n The plots passed through the origin when the background correction\n\nwas accurately estimated.\n Standards employed in the procedure include International Atomic\n\nEnergy Agency ( IAEA) standards S-12 and s-16 ( IAEA 1987) and an accurately\n\ndetermined sand sample obtained from the National Radiological Protection\n\nBoard in Britain. \n\n  Potassuim-40 was determined by its counts under the peak centered\n\nat 1461 keV, with calibration performed using samples of highly pure\n\npotassium sulfate.\n Potassium-40 was assumed to be 0.0117% of the potassium in these\n\nsamples ( Weast 1988).\n Verifications performed with mixed standards, i.e., standards\n\ncontaining  40  K,  226  Ra, and  232  Th,\n\nrevealed a significant contribution to the  40  K peak by the \n\n238  U/  226  Ra series.\n This was not surprising because the peak had a\n\nfull-width-tenth-maximum of nearly 200 keV; thus, a contribution due to the\n\nlow-intensity  214  Bi peaks between 1,360 and 1,560 keV could be\n\nexpected ( see Table 1).\n\n\n226  Ra content of the sample, and the efficiency of the detector in\n\nthis region and was subtracted from the counts obtained for each sample\n\nunder this peak. \n\n  The samples examined included sand and gravel, cement, soil,\n\nred mud, concrete aggregates, wood, and gypsum ceiling tiles.\n Only two samples of cement and local gypsum were examined because\n\nthere is only one manufacturer of each on the island.\n Sand and gravel and soil samples were taken from representative\n\nlocations in the eastern half of the island, while wood and imported gyp <l>\n\nsum were taken at random from stocks imported for local use.\n Samples were crushed, where necessary, to less than 2-mm particle\n\nsizes, dried overnight at 110 &degree; C, and packed into flat tins ( 7 cm\n\ndiameter x 3cm) where they were   sealed and\n\nleft for about 5 wk before they were assayed.\n An average of about 60 g of material was present in each container.\n\n\n\n \n\ncertainties on the order of &plus-minus; 7%, &plus-minus; 15%, and\n\n&plus-minus; 25% for the activity concentrations, and limits of detection of\n\n4, 2, and 40 By kg  - 1  for  226  Ra,  232  Th,\n\nand  40  K, respectively.\n K\n\narose because of fairly high background counts for this nuclide on the\n\ndetector system, presumably because of the potassium contained in the\n\ncrystal/photomultiplier unit.\n The uncertainty could be reduced somewhat by increasing the counting\n\ntime from 6,000s to 12,000s, but this was considered unnecessary in all\n\nbut the wood and gypsum samples, where the low density of the material\n\nmeant that less than 15g were contained in the sample tins; thus, the net\n\ncounts were rather low. \n\n  Comparing values obtained on samples of the same origin analysed\n\nby this method and those obtained independently by Neutron Activation\n\nAnalysis gives an idea of the accuracy of  232  Th measurements.\n ) Company A mud (\n\n328,366 Bq kg  - 1  ) , and cement ( 10,8.6 Bq kg  - 1  )\n\nall gave values by the two methods, which fall within &plus-minus; 15% of\n\neach other. \n\n \n\n \n\nvironmental levels of the radionuclides can be seen in all materials except\n\nthose derived from red mud or contaminated by bauxitic soils.\n K\n\nover that of other materials, but this is not considered a significant hazard\n\nin most circumstances because the mass of board used is typically quite\n\nsmall. \n\n  To put the activities obtained into the context of hazards to\n\nbuilding occupants, the effective &gamma; dose equivalents have been\n\nestimated for a standard-sized room, assuming a relationship between\n\nactivity and dose equivalent of the following form ( Ackers et al.\n\n1984):  \n\n  is the effective dose equivalent resulting\n\nfrom &gamma; emitters in the building material;  Q  K   ,\n\n Q  Ra   , and  Q  Th   are factors\n\nrepresenting the absorbed dose rate in air at the center of the room ( Gyh\n\n - 1  per Bq kg  - 1  ) ;  C  K,i   ,\n\n C  Ra,i   , and  C  Th,i   represent the\n\nactivity concentrations of each of the radionuclides in material  i \n\n, and  m  i   is the mass fraction of each type of material\n\nused in the construction.  Y  is essentially a factor that converts\n\nabsorbed dose in air to effective dose equivalent in humans ( SvGy  - 1\n\n ) , and  T  is the number of hours per year the occupant is\n\ninside the room. \n\n Coefficients calculated by several different methods have been reported\n\nby Koblinger ( 1994) for a  " standard"  room of similar size,\n\nwall thickness, and wall density as the room examined in our prototype house.\n Typical values for these coefficients are given as 0.61, 6.94, and\n\n8.42 &gamma; Gy y  - 1  per Gy kg  - 1  for  Q  K\n\n  ,  Q  Ra   , and  Q  Th   ,\n\nrespectively, for a room with dimensions 5 x 4 x 2.8 m  3  and walls\n\n20 cm thick, constructed of material with a density of 2.32 x 10  3 \n\nkg m  - 3  .\n .\n The room in the prototype house has dimensions of 4.8 x 3.7 x 2.8 m\n\n 3  and has walls just over 20 cm thick with density of about 2.0 x\n\n10  3  kg m  - 3  . Koblinger\'s analysis ( 1978)\n\nsuggests that these differences in size and wall density are not likely to\n\nmake a significant difference in   the exposure\n\nor, by implication, in the effective dose equivalent at the center of the two\n\nrooms. However, unlike Koblinger\'s standard room, the room in the prototype\n\nhouse has significant wall area left void for windows and doors.\n It is not an isolated structure but part of a house that has overall\n\ndimensions of 6.7 x 6.7 x 2.8 m  3  .\n Thus, there are smaller adjoining rooms on one side and in the back.\n Additionally, the roof and floor are constructed of conventional\n\nconcrete, and the walls are constructed of red mud blocks. \n\n  To consider these differences when making an estimate of the\n\neffective dose equivalent, the contribution of the walls was separated from\n\nthe contribution of the roof and floor.\n The contribution of the walls to the exposure and, by implication, to\n\nthe effective dose equivalent at the center of a room is nearly 25% in all\n\ncases in the literature where the contributions are separated ( Koblin <l>\n\nger 1978; Standen 1979; Mustonen 1984).\n Thus, the contribution of the walls in the room of the prototype\n\nhouse can be found from the following equation:  \n\n  Ra\n\n  , and  Q  Th   are taken as 25% of those given\n\nin eqn ( 1);  m  is taken as 76%, since windows, doors, and\n\nconventional concrete occupy the remaining 24% of the wall space. \n\n  Nuclide concentrations in the walls are taken as those for red\n\nmud building blocks given in Table 2.\n , the conversion factor for absorbed dose in air to\n\neffective dose equivalent in the human body, is taken as 0.7 Sv Gy  - 1\n\n ( UNSCEAR 1982).\n The contribution of the roof and floor is then calculated using a\n\nsimilar equation with coefficients that are the remaining 75% of the quoted\n\nvalues.\n The radionuclide concentrations used for the floor and roof are those\n\nfor recent concrete aggregates reported in Table 2. \n\n \n\n- 1  at the center of the room was obtained, but this is an\n\nunderestimate because the effect of the walls in the adjacent rooms was\n\nnot considered.\n Koblinger ( 1984) suggests as much as a 40% increase in the\n\neffective dose-equivalent rate at the center of a room because of an  "\n\ninfinite plane network"  of adjacent rooms, when the wall\n\nthicknesses are of the order of 5 cm, but finds the contribution to be\n\nalmost negligible when the walls are of the order of 30 cm or more.\n In this case, with just two adjacent rooms and wall thicknesses over\n\n20 cm, an increase of less than 5% would be expected.\n An effective &gamma; dose equivalent of approximately 0.57\n\n&plus-minus; 0.05 mSv y  - 1  is, therefore, predicted from the\n\nbuilding material used to construct this room, when this increase is\n\nincluded. \n\n  Measurements made with thermoluminescent detectors exposed\n\nin film-badge- type card-holders give a value of 1.12 &plus-minus; 0.16 mGy y\n\n - 1  for the absorbed dose to deep tissues at the center of the\n\nroom.\n This converts to an effective dose equivalent of 0.78 &plus-minus;\n\n0.11 mSv y  - 1  when the conversion factor of 0.7 Sv Gy  - 1\n\n is applied.\n The measured value differs from the calculated value by 0.21\n\n&plus-minus; 0.12 mSv y  - 1  a difference that can be attributed\n\nquite reasonably to cosmic-ray radiation and radiation from the subjacent\n\nsoil.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '61564820-0064-44ae-a1e4-9488e6629a4c', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.349107+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9519392251968384, 'non_english_score': 0.04806077480316162}

Desai, 1977; Youngbluth, 1976; Wear,\n\n1984).\n Usually the pollutant reduces species diversity, increases population\n\nsize and causes episodic pulses of the zooplankton community. \n\n  In Jamaica, Kingston Harbour has been the focus of numerous\n\necological studies which primarily sought to monitor the levels of pollution\n\nand its impact on the flora and fauna of the area.\n Wade ( 1971) reported that the Harbour was polluted and that the most\n\nsevere form of pollution was eutrophication.\n Successive studies revealed the rate of deterioration of the benthic\n\ncommunities was such that total destruction was imminent if the increasing\n\neutrophication remained unchecked ( Wade  et al.  , 1972).\n This increasing organic pollution was also reported to have\n\nsignificant effects on the planktonic communities within the Harbour (\n\nGrahame, 1976; Moore & Sander, 1979), causing increases in phytoplankton\n\nproduction and zooplankton community size.\n By 1982, Moore and Sander described Kingston Harbour as a highly\n\neutrophic body of water. \n\n  Previous zooplankton investigations on the southern shelf of\n\nJamaica have compared the eutrophic Harbour to the coastal shelf and oceanic\n\nwaters ( Moore, 1967; Moore & Sander, 1979).\n However, there is no comprehensive investigation of the zooplankton\n\nof the Hellshire area which lies immediately south-west of Kingston Harbour.\n It has been suggested that outflow from the harbour, which is\n\nnormally via a weak, southerly-flowing surface current ( Sherwin & Deeming,\n\n1980), impacts the Hellshire coastline.\n This polluted outflow is thought to produce a gradient of\n\neutrophication from the north-eastern sector of Hellshire which decreases\n\ntowards the south-west.\n Investigations along Hellshire have also reported rapid, deleterious\n\nchanges in the coral reef and seagrass communities, coupled with observations\n\nof severe beach erosion in the bays closest to Kingston Harbour ( Head &\n\nHendry, 1985; Bacon & Head, 1985).\n The observed degradation along Hellshire and the proposed\n\nfurther development of the area as a major urban centre created the need for\n\nintensive baseline studies and the identification of sources of\n\neutrophication to the area. \n\n  The above information suggests that there is one major source of\n\neutrophication to the Hellshire area, Kingston Harbour.\n These polluted waters are advected through the area undergoing\n\nprogressive dilution by oceanic waters as the distance form the harbour\n\nincreases.\n Alternatively there may be other sources of eutrophication located in\n\nthe Hellshire area which would have immediate and large-scale effects on the\n\narea. \n\n  The objectives of this study were therefore to provide basic data\n\non the zooplankton populations of Hellshire, identify zooplankton indices\n\nwhich may be useful monitors of increasing organic pollution (\n\neutrophication) and identify the source or sources of eutrophication stress\n\nto the Hellshire area. \n\n \n\n  The Hellshire area ( Figure 1), which lies south-west of\n\nKingston, consists of approximately 10 000 acres of arid karst limestone\n\nhills, coastal lagoons, beaches and rocky headlands.\n The 27-km stretch of coastline consists of a variety of highly\n\nproductive coastal habitats which include coral reefs, seagrass beds and\n\nmangals.\n The major lagoonal system in the area, the Great Salt Pond, is a\n\nshallow mangrove lagoon of 17.2 ha ( Reeson, 1971).\n It receives land runoff and partially treated sewage from the Breaton\n\narea of St Catherine ( P. Bacon, pers. comm.)\n The Salt Pond opens into the eastern end of Hellshire Bay via a 10-m\n\nwide artificial channel. \n\n  The north-eastern sector of the Hellshire coastline which is\n\ndelimited by Small Point in the north-east and Wreck Point in the south-west\n\nis 15 km long and consists of seven major bays.\n These bays are all relatively shallow ( 1-5 m) and are protected by\n\nreefs and sand banks to varying degrees.\n Kingston Harbour will not be described here as this has been\n\nextensively done by Goodbody ( 1961) and Moore and Sander ( 1982). \n\n \n\n  The 16 stations selected ( Figure 1) were sampled at monthly\n\nintervals for a 17- month period.\n Three stations ( 1, 2 and 3) were located across the mouth of\n\nKingston Harbour, six ( stations 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10) within the bays found\n\nalong the Hellshire coastline and one ( station 5) inside the Great Salt\n\nPond.\n\n\ncaption  3 km from the shoreline ( called  'offshore' \n\nstations).\n An additional station ( 16) was located at South-east Cay, the most\n\neasterly of the Port Royal Cays, in an area which would not come under the\n\ninfluence of Kingston Harbour or be affected by land runoff from Hellshire.\n\n\n\n  Zooplankton collections were made with a 200-&mu; m mesh plankton\n\nnet with a hoop diameter of 0.5 m ( SCOR, WP2 pattern; UNESCO, 1968). Surface\n\ntows were conducted in a circular path ( circle diameter 30-40 m) at a speed\n\nof 0.5 ms  - 1  and lasted 5 min.\n Sampling coefficient of variation, given by the equation, C.V. = (\n\nstandard deviaton x 100)/mean involving repeated tows at the same station (\n\nn=5), was determined for all stations.\n This yielded an average sampling coefficient of variation for the\n\narea of 15.6% ( range 2.29-25.99).\n Salinity and temperature measurements were also done at each station\n\ncontemporaneously with faunal collections.\n The filtering efficiency of the net used was determined at each\n\nstation using two general oceanic digital flow meters with low-velocity\n\nrotors.\n\n\n  Identification and counting were performed on an aliquot of the\n\nsample preserved in 10% formalin.\n A subsample was taken using a 60-ml graduated syringe while keeping\n\nthe sample agitated ( Tremblay & Roff, 1983).\n All taxonomic groups were subsampled in this manner with the\n\nexception of the larger medusae and ctenophores which were too large to be\n\npicked up by the syringe and were counted separately.\n Each subsample was transferred to the circular tray of a modified\n\nJames Ward Plankton Counter ( Bacon, 1971; Ferraris, 1982) and viewed under a\n\nWolfe dissecting microscope.\n The precision of this technique was tested by enumerating the total\n\nnumbers in five subsamples from each station and calculating the coefficient\n\nof variation.\n These yielded an average subsampling coefficient of variation of 7.5%\n\n( range between 2.07 and 16.28).\n For biomass determinations, a portion of each sample was washed with\n\ndistilled water and dried to constant weight at 60 &degree; C. \n\n  Two communities index tests were applied to the data using the\n\nspecies composition.\n These were the Jaccard Community Coefficient ( Whittaker & Fairbanks,\n\n1958) and the Percent Similarity Coefficient ( e.g. Kwiatkowski & Roff,\n\n1976).\n formula\n\n where  a  is the number of species present at both stations,\n\n b  is the number of species present at station 1 but not at station\n\n2 and  c  is the number of species present at station 2 but not at\n\nstation 1.\n This coefficient thus neglects conjoint absences and is based on\n\npresence or absence, not the number of times present of the quantity.\n Thus single rare occurrences will carry as much weight as those that\n\nare regular and in large amounts.\n\n\nformula  where  a'  and  b'  are the respective\n\npercentage of animals ( for each species) at each pair of stations.\n This coefficient neglects single rare occurrences and thus may\n\ncompensate for the weakness of the Jaccard Community Coefficient.\n Both coefficients were calculated comparing the community at\n\nstations 1, 6 and 15 to that at all other stations.\n Stations 1 ( Harbour mouth) and 6 ( Great Salt Pond) were the\n\nsuspected sources to the area and 15 was thought to represent the extreme\n\npristine end of the system. \n\n \n\n \n\n  Salinity and temperature with means of 33.5 and 28.5 &degree; C,\n\nrespectively, were found to not vary significantly spatially or temporally (\n\nMANOVA test with  F  value probabilities of 0.9670 and 0.9136).\n The lack of spatial and temporal variation in these variables is\n\ntypical of this area ( Moore & Sander, 1979, 1982) and thus cannot account\n\nfor spatial variation of the biota.\n The salinity in Kingston Harbour and along Hellshire changes\n\nsignificantly only under conditions of extreme flooding ( Goodbody, 1961).\n\n\n\n \n\n  The coefficient of variation associated with subsamples and\n\nrepeated plankton tows at each station indicated the degree of variability\n\nassociated with the techniques.\n It must be noted that the variation inherent in the methodology (\n\naverage 7.5 and 15.6% C.V.) was low compared with that obtained from monthly\n\nvariation in the parameters, which in some cases exceeded 300% C.V. ( Figure\n\n3). \n\n \n\n  It can be postulated that high mean biomass or numbers coupled\n\nwith high monthly fluctuations are indicative of an area subject to periodic\n\nlarge-scale enrichment ( landderived nutrients); high mean values with\n\nlow fluctuations indicate regular large-scale enrichment.\n Similarly, low mean values with high monthly fluctuations are\n\nindicative of an area subject to infrequent enrichment and areas where both\n\nmean values and monthly fluctuations are low constantly receive little or no\n\nenrichment. \n\n  of the zooplankton\n\npopulation at each station ( Figure 2) varied significantly throughout the\n\narea ( Table 1).\n Maximum mean values were recorded at station 1, at the west of the\n\nHarbour mouth, usually followed by the other Harbour mouth stations ( 2 and\n\n3).\n Occasionally the population size at station 5 at the mouth of the\n\nGreat Salt Pond and station 7 in Hellshire Bay exceeded those at the harbour\n\nmouth stations, and the monthly fluctuations ( % C.V.) calculated for these\n\nstations usually exceeded that at the Harbour or any other station throughout\n\nthe area.\n The degree of monthly fluctuation ( % C.V.) in total numbers and\n\nbiomass was greater than 50% at most stations and was as high as 200% at\n\nstations 5 and 9.\n High monthly fluctuation or episodic behaviour is not uncommon in\n\ntropical coastal zooplankton communities, but such large values suggest\n\ncommunity instability usually resulting from enrichment. \n\n  There was a pattern of gradual decline in total numbers at\n\n 'offshore'  stations ( 11 to 15) with distance from the\n\nHarbour.\n There was no similar gradual decline along the bays due to the large\n\nvalues recorded at stations 5 and 7.\n Station 4 ( Green Bay) is the closest bay to the Harbour and would\n\ntherefore be expected to have the greatest values of all bay stations.\n Stations within Hellshire Bay however had the greatest populations of\n\nall the bay stations.\n Thus the distribution within the bays cannot be explained by gradual\n\ndilution with distance from a source of enrichment ( Kingston Harbour).\n Simple linear regression revealed that a greater per cent of the\n\nvariation in biomass and, to a lesser extent, total numbers at the  'offshore'\n\n</quote > stations was attributable to distance from the harbour, more so\n\nthan at the bays ( Table 2).\n This successful regression model suggests a gradual decline with\n\ndistance along Hellshire which is strongest along the  'offshore'\n\n area. \n\n \n\n  Seventy-nine different taxa were identified throughout the area\n\nsampled ( Table 3).", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '3b7e4550-250d-4c91-a898-8671101a7366', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.350467+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9525788426399231, 'non_english_score': 0.047421157360076904}
{'text': 'Jamaica in 1988 had a population of approximately 2.43 million and\n\nGross Domestic Product of US$2,858 million.\n The agricultural GDP in 1987 was US$174 million with fisheries\n\naccounting for approximately 1% of this amount.\n In 1987 the unemployment rate in Jamaica stood at 21% of the labour\n\nforce ( PIOJ, 1988). \n\n  Jamaica is located in the Greater Antilles, in the Caribbean Sea,\n\napproximately 145 km south of Cuba and 161 km west of Haiti ( Fig.1).\n The island is 236 km long, between 35 and 82 km wide, with a total\n\nland area of 10,940 km  2  and a coastline of approximately 885 km.\n\n\n\n The topography consists of an interior backbone of mountain ranges\n\nrunning almost the length of the island from roughly east to west, surrounded\n\nby flat coastal plains.\n The Blue Mountains in the east have the highest peak at 2,256 m.\n The interior of the central and western two-thirds of the island is\n\ndominated by a limestone plateaux, the majority of which lies between 350-610\n\nm ( NRCD, 1987). \n\n  The irregular coastline is punctuated by numerous coastal\n\nfeatures such as harbours, bays, beaches, estuaries, mangrove swamps, rocky\n\nshores, cays, coral reefs and lagoons.\n These natural features provide a resource base that contributes\n\nsignificantly to the economic well-being of the country, chiefly through\n\ntourism. \n\n  Jamaica has a tropical maritime climate which is modified by\n\nnortheast trade winds and land-sea breezes.\n Temperature is fairly uniform in the coastal areas.\n The average temperature is 27 &degree; C, ranging from a low of 23\n\n&degree; C, in the winter ( January and February) to 28 &degree; C in the\n\nsummer ( June-August).\n Humidity is usually above 60% and is generally highest in the morning\n\n( 85%), falling slightly by mid afternoon.\n Rainfall in Jamaica is marked by monthly, annual, and spatial\n\nvariability.\n The average annual rainfall for the entire island is 195.8 cm and\n\ngreatest rainfall occurs form October to November with a secondary peak in\n\nMay. \n\n \n\n  The Island lies within the path of north-easterly trade winds and\n\nwind speeds exceeding 15m/sec with associated choppy seas are common.\n A season of relative calm usually occurs between October and February\n\neach year ( Munro, 1983).\n a hurricane season in the\n\nCaribbean from July to October each year during which unstable weather\n\nsystems, including violent storms, occur. \n\n  The branch of the North Equatorial current which flows westwards\n\nand enters the south-eastern Caribbean Basin is the dominant surface current\n\nsystem affecting Jamaica.\n It exits the Caribbean Sea via the Yucatan Channel and then passes\n\nbetween Florida and the Bahamas as the Florida current before rejoining the\n\neastern branch of the North Equatorial current to become the Gulf Stream, and\n\neventually the upper portion of the North Atlantic Gyre ( Lyons, 1980; Apel,\n\n1987).\n The presence of east flowing surface and sub-surface counter currents\n\nand gyres on both sides of the main current has been reported by Emilson ( in\n\nMunro, 1983). \n\n  Munro ( 1983) reported that tidal effect on the Jamaican Coast is\n\nslight, the range varying between 20 cm and 36 cm.\n Tidal currents on Pedro Bank are reported to be sometimes sufficient\n\nto stop or reverse the flow of the prevailing westerly Caribbean current.\n\n\n\n  The annual temperature range of the surface waters south of\n\nJamaica down to a depth of about 75 m is reported to be between 26.5 &degree;\n\nC and 29.5 &degree; C ( Munro, 1983).\n Goodbody and Munro ( 1971) reported fairly constant salinity of 35.2\n\nto 35.8% in the waters south of Jamaica. \n\n \n\n  Jamaica has a 12 mile territorial zone around the main Island as\n\nwell as around the offshore Morant and Pedro Cays.\n In keeping with the provisions of the International Convention on the\n\nLaw of the Sea, Jamaica is presently in the process of drafting a bill for\n\nthe establishment of a 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone ( EEZ), which would\n\ninclude the existing 12 miles territorial limit.\n The matter, however, is a complex one and may take some time to be\n\nsuccessfully implemented. \n\n \n\n  The Island shelf and nine proximal banks ( Fig. 1) have a total\n\narea of 4,170 km  2  .\n The South Shelf is relatively wide whilst the North Shelf is very\n\nnarrow and its width does not exceed 1.5 km at any point.\n The North Shelf is characterized by fringing coral reefs with few\n\ngaps, from Morant Point in the east to Negril in the west.\n The fringing reef and the sill reef are almost contiguous along the\n\nnorth coast.\n The South Shelf attains a maximum width of 24 km south of the\n\nparishes of St. Catherine and Clarendon ( Fig.2).\n Large reefs are restricted to the eastern portion of the South Shelf,\n\nsmall patches of corals, gorgonians and seaweeds, interspersed with sandy\n\npatches are found in most other areas of the South Shelf.\n Well developed sill reefs occur along most of the edge of the South\n\nShelf.\n The sill reef and drop-off are generally characterized by massive\n\ncorals.   \n\n \n\n  The Morant and Pedro Banks rise abruptly from depths exceeding\n\n500 m to form submerged plateaux with average depths from 20 to 30 m.\n 2\n\n whilst the Morant Bank is relatively small being approximately 100 km\n\n 2  in area ( Munro and Thompson, 1983). \n\n  The Pedro Bank may be divided into various depth zones as\n\nfollows: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  The top of the Pedro Bank is relatively flat whereas the edges\n\nare characterized by sill reefs of various sizes.\n The shallowest, south-eastern, southern and south-western portions of\n\nthe Bank, which face into the Caribbean Current, have the best developed\n\nreefs.\n The middle of Pedro Bank is dominated by silt and sand with sparsely\n\ndispersed patches of sea grass, algae, and isolated coral heads.\n In contrast to the edge, the middle of the Bank is reported to be\n\nrelatively unproductive ( Munro and Thompson, 1983).\n Beyond the sill reefs at the edge of the Bank the depth increases\n\nabruptly sometimes by near vertical drops to more than 500 m.\n At the eastern section of Pedro Bank there are three small cays two\n\nof which are inhabited by fishermen.\n Small cays also occur on the Morant Bank, and are occupied by\n\nfishermen. \n\n \n\n \n\n  In order to fully understand the different types of resources,\n\ntheir locations and rates of exploitation in the Jamaican fishery, it is\n\nfirst necessary to examine briefly the organization of the fishery itself.\n\n\n\n  The fishery of Jamaica is made up largely of artisanal fishermen\n\noperating from open canoe type boats powered by either outboard motors or\n\noars.\n There are approximately 12,000 registered persons who fish using\n\napproximately 4,000 boats from 168 fishing beaches scattered around the\n\nJamaican coastline.\n The artisanal fishery may be sub-divided into two main sectors, the\n\ninshore fishery and the offshore fishery. \n\n \n\n  The inshore fishery takes place in the coastal waters of the\n\nIsland shelf and its nine proximal banks ( Fig.1).\n Historically, the shelf and proximal banks have supported the bulk of\n\nfishery activities in terms of manpower and vessels.\n The major fishing gear used in the artisanal fishery is the Z-shaped\n\nantillean fish trap.\n Other common gear include gill nets, seine nets, hook-and-line, and\n\nspearguns.\n There is some collection of crustaceans, molluscs and algae by\n\ndivers. \n\n \n\n  This includes fishing operations that are based on the offshore\n\ncays, as well as deep- sea fishing conducted by vessels operating\n\nindependently of any land base for extended periods.\n There is at present a fleet of approximately 250 mechanized canoe\n\ntype boats and approximately 700 fishermen based on the Morant and Pedro Cays\n\n( Fig.1).\n They are serviced by carrier boats in the 10-26 m size range which\n\nply between the Cays and Kingson, transporting supplies to the fishermen and\n\nreturning with fish in ice.\n During the 1980s there was a significant change in the fleet of\n\ncarrier vessels with smaller, faster, open hull vessels replacing the larger\n\ndecked boats.\n In addition to the Cay based operation, there are about five vessels\n\nranging in size from 15-30 m operating on either the Pedro Bank or in\n\nextra-territorial waters.\n The Morant Bank supports about 120 fishermen using between 40 to 50\n\ncanoe type vessels ( Anon., 1989). \n\n  The fisheries of Jamaica are based primarily on multispecies\n\ncoral reef fish resources.\n Families of major economic importance are Lutjanidae, Serranidae,\n\nCarangidae, Mullidae, Scaridae, Haemulidae, Balistidae, Acanthuridae,\n\nHolocentridae, Chaetodontidae, Palinuridae ( lobsters).\n Among the coastal pelagic fishes the most important families are\n\nClupeidae, Engraulidae, Mugilidae, Scombridae, and Hemiramphidae. \n\n \n\n  There is not as yet a permanent system for the collection of\n\ncatch and effort statistics on an island-wide basis.\n The available estimates have come from Government surveys conducted\n\non irregular basis, as well as from research projects.\n Limited data are also obtained from the Fisheries Division through\n\nvarious monitoring programmes.\n Available figures for landings from the inshore fishery are presented\n\nin Table 1.\n Catch estimated by Government sample surveys are presented in Table\n\n2.\n The six surveys showed an average of 7,600 t with a standard\n\ndeviation of 1,400 t.\n Landings from the offshore fishery are estimated to be about 2,000 t\n\nannually.\n Total catch from all areas of the Jamaican fisheries is estimated to\n\nbe about 9,000 t. \n\n  It is important to note that prior to 1955 there was no offshore\n\nfishery and the total catch came from the inshore fishing grounds.\n In 1955 a boat mechanization scheme was launched by the Fisheries\n\nDivision and by 1981 approximately 54% of the fishing boats in the Island\n\nwere mechanized. Soon after the mechanization programme started some boats\n\nfrom beaches along the South Jamaican Shelf travelled to Pedro Bank to fish\n\nand returned to their home base with the catch.\n The sample surveys conducted before 1981 assumed that the fish landed\n\non the South Shelf beaches were captured solely from the South Shelf.\n\n\ncaption     Shelf means that\n\nthe productivity of the South Shelf may have been overestimated. \n\n \n\n  Aiken and Haughton ( 1987) analyzed the available statistical\n\ndata on the inshore fishery and found that although the total catch and the\n\ntotal number of boats in operation changed very little between 1968 and 1981,\n\nvery significant changes in fishing effort and fishing pattern were taking\n\nplace as a consequence of the process of mechanization.\n Between 1968 and 1981 fishing effort was estimated to have doubled\n\nwhereas the catch remained at about the same level. \n\n  An examination of the process of mechanization of the fishing\n\nfleet reveals that very significant changes in both fishing effort and\n\nfishing patterns were taking place.\n The mechanized canoes which are replacing the unmechanized canoes are\n\ncapable of carrying more fishermen, going farther offshore, spending longer\n\nperiods in the fishing grounds and hauling more fish traps than the\n\nunmechanized canoes.\n\n\n  Haughton ( 1988) developed a standardized measure of fishing\n\neffort which was termed  " effective canoe effort"  .\n Since 1968 the catch per effective canoe has been steadily declining\n\nand by 1981 it was 59% of the catch rate in 1968 ( Fig.3).\n A logarithmic surplus production model of the inshore fishery in\n\nJamaica suggests that maximum yields of around 2.2 t/km  2  / year\n\nare possible with a fishing intensity of between 1.0 to 1.2 mechanized canoes\n\nper km  2  of shelf ( Fig.4). \n\n \n\n  The available figures published by FAO ( 1987) indicate that for\n\nthe entire Caribbean region, the average yield from shelf areas around the\n\nCaribbean islands is around 0.5-1.5 t/km  2  year.\n This is less than some earlier estimates, which tended not to take\n\ninto account the proportion of relatively unproductive sandy bottom.\n In Jamaica on the other hand the average yield from the island shelf\n\nand proximal bank, computed from the Government sample surveys, was 1.7 t/km\n\n 2  / year between 1968-1981. \n\n \n\n  Stock assessment studies of Jamaica\'s fishing grounds have been\n\nconducted by Munro ( 1969-1973), Cuba-Jamaica Fisheries Research Project (\n\n1977-1978), USSR-Jamaica Fisheries Research Project ( 1979-1980), and\n\nHartsuijker and Nicholson ( 1979-1981).', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'bf19c870-289c-4213-a136-abc0de6e1b74', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.351939+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9543958306312561, 'non_english_score': 0.045604169368743896}

The Climatology Branch of the Jamaican Meteorology Service.\n\n\n  Since the rainfall seems to peak around April, May and June (\n\nFigure 2), it is of interest to see if these months have the same charac <l>\n\nteristics.\n Table 1 shows the mean, maximum, minimum and standard deviations for\n\nthe annual monthly average rainfall for the three months.\n In addition to the peak in May, one sees that the mean rainfall in\n\nJune is greater than in April and that the fractional deviation in May is\n\nless than in April and June.\n Other comparisons of characteristics of individual months are\n\ngiven below.   \n\n \n\n  A power spectrum analysis, the results of which are given in Fig.\n\n3, shows that the annual       average of the April \x13 June\n\nrainfall has a dominant periodicity of 64.1 years ( frequency = 0.01563\n\nyear  - 1  ) and a secondary periodicity of 9.15 years (\n\nfrequency=0.10938 year  1  ) .\n The 95% confidence intervals for the periodograms for the two periods\n\nare 6.30 x 10  4  to 918.90 x 10  4  and 0.52 x 10  4\n\n to 76.28 x 10  4  respectively.\n The 64 year period is a trend in the data.\n Less significant periods of 6.9, 2.9, 2.2 and 1.9 years were\n\nobserved. \n\n  The individual months were analyzed by means of harmonic analysis\n\nand related power spectrum analysis to determine if they exhibited the same\n\nperiodicity as the average.\n Tables 2(a)-2(c) show the first 5 leading harmonics for April, May\n\nand June respectively.\n Table 3 shows the corresponding results for the power spectrum\n\nanalysis.\n The three months exhibit different harmonic behavior.\n Both tables show that April\'s rainfall tend to be composed of\n\nharmonics of lower frequencies or greater periods, June rainfall of\n\nhigher frequencies or lower periods, while May rainfall comes in between.\n Table 3 shows that, while the three months exhibit a 64 year\n\nperiodicity, only April and May have a 9.1 year periodicity.     \n\n \n\n  The power spectra for April, May and June are composed of many\n\nfrequencies, some of which may be mathematical representations of the time\n\nseries.\n\n\n  The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation ( QBO) has a period of\n\napproximately 26 months or 2.1 years.\n The June data has a strong 2.1 year component, while the April data\n\nhas a weak peak for the same period.\n\n\nfall and QBO and this would have to be investigated further.\n It will be shown below that the longer periods in the April data\n\ncould be related to the 11 year solar cycle through the phase of the QBO in\n\nsuch a way that the 11 year period of the solar activity will not be\n\nexplicitly evident. \n\n \n\n show that correlations between weather elements and solar activity\n\nincrease when the years are grouped according to the phase of the QBO.\n\n\n 2.

Rev.,  1989, 49, 239-258.\n\n\n In particular, they found that correlations were higher when\n\nweather elements were correlated with solar activity during the westerly\n\nphase of the QBO. Figure 4 shows a plot of rainfall and solar activity during\n\nthe years when the QBO was in the westerly phase at 15 mb.\n The years were chosen in such a way that the western phase of the QBO\n\nwas evident at 15 mb for most of the year, starting at least in January and\n\ncontinuing through to July, at least.\n In this way the physical phenomenon responsible for the westerly\n\nphase of the QBO would be well established in April.\n The coefficient of correlation between corresponding rainfall\n\nvalues and solar flux values was 0.79.\n\n\ndence limit lies between 0.95 and 0.32.\n Although the cycle is approximately 11 years, it may not be\n\nevident when all years are considered, such as in harmonic analysis of\n\ntime series.\n Figure 5 shows the variation of April rainfall from 1951 \x13 1990.\n The rainfall data for years in which the QBO was in the westerly\n\nphase at 15 mb are denoted by filled boxes.\n It can be seen that, although the filled boxes exhibit an\n\napproximate 11 year cycle, such a cycle is masked when the rainfall from\n\nother years are taken into account.\n It could however combine with other periods, acting as a modulation,\n\nto produce other frequencies as explained in the next section. \n\n  reported at a regional conference\n\nthat, during recorded El Ni&ntilde;o years for the 1951-1983 period, the\n\nratio of above normal rainfall anomalies to below normal anomalies was 2:1\n\nfor May, whereas the ratio was 1:1 or less for other months. \n 3. Blake, J.; Brown, P. National Meteorological Office, Private\n\nCommunication, 1993. \n It is worthwhile investigating whether or not the 4 year\n\nperiodicity in the May data, shown in Tables 2(b) and 3, may in some way be\n\ncorrelated to moderate and stronger El Ni&ntilde;o events, since the period\n\nof re-occurrence of these events from 1951 \x13 1990 was approximately 4.3\n\nyears.\n The moderate and stronger El Ni&ntilde;o years 1951 \x13 1987 are listed\n\nby Enfield  as 1953 ( M+), 1957/58 ( S), 1965 ( M+),\n\n1972/73 ( S), 1976 ( M), 1982/83 ( VS) and 1987 ( M), where ( M) refers to\n\nmoderate, ( S) to strong and ( VS) to very strong. \n Oceanography,\n\n 1988, 1, 23-27, 59. \n graph\n\n    1969 as an El\n\nNi&ntilde;o year.  5.

Climate System Monitoring Monthly Bulletin, Issue No. 5, 1993,\n\nUNEP-WMO. \n The value of 359 mm for 1993 is an estimation based on data available\n\nfrom 14 of the 21 stations used in the 1951-1990 analysis; the average\n\nrainfall in May 1993 for the island based on all data collected at the\n\nNational Meteorological Service is 559 mm, with a long-term mean of 211\n\nmm for May.\n Rainfall data for 1992, also an El Ni&ntilde;o year, as well as\n\nprevious years were destroyed in a fire at the National Meteorological\n\nService.\n The years of moderate or stronger El Ni&ntilde;o events are\n\nhighlighted by filled boxes and the mean value of the rainfall for the\n\nperiod, 1951-90, is indicated by the solid horizontal line.\n From the graph it can be seen that, for El Ni&ntilde;o years, the\n\nration of above mean to below mean rainfall is 7:4 for the 1951-1990 period\n\nand 8:4 or 2 when 1993 is included.\n For other months the ratio was found to be 1:1 or less for the 1951 \x13\n\n1990 period, except for the months of January and April, where the ratio is\n\n6:5. \n\n  Table 4(a) shows a contingency table used to test the\n\nsignificance of the relationship between May rainfall and El Ni&ntilde;o\n\nevents.\n The years from 1951 \x13 1990 and 1993 were classified as either El\n\nNi&ntilde;o or non El Ni&ntilde;o years.\n The rainfall for each classification was placed into either of 2\n\nclasses, those years when rainfall was above the 1951 \x13 1990 average and\n\nthose years with rainfall below.\n = 2.82.\n\nSince &chi;  2   .95  = 3.84, then deviations from\n\nexpectation as large or larger than occurred in this table could be found\n\nmore than 5% of the time, and the null hypothesis that above normal rainfall\n\nis unrelated to El Ni&ntilde;o events cannot be rejected. \n\n  Figure 6 also shows that of the 5 years in which May rainfall\n\nexceeded 300 mm, 4 of those years were El Ni&ntilde;o years.\n Table 4(b) gives the contingency table for the above data when the\n\nclasses are defined as those years with rainfall above 300 mm and rainfall\n\nbelow 300    \n\n  mm.\n = 7.08.\n However, the significance of the test is suspect since the frequency\n\nof two of the cells is less than 5.\n Nonetheless the Yates corrected chi-square, which corrects for small\n\ndata, gives &chi;  2  = 4.56.\n Thus the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between heavy\n\nrainfall above 300 mm and El Ni&ntilde;o events can be rejected. \n\n  The question of whether or not the 4 year periodicity of the May\n\nrainfall is associated with the 4.3 year re-occurrence period of El\n\nNi&ntilde;o is still unanswered.\n From Figure 6 it can be seen that from 1951 \x13 1070, the peaks in the\n\nMay rainfall in 1953, 1958, 1963 and 1970 coincide approximately with the\n\nre-occurrence of El Ni&ntilde;o, if 1957/58 is counted as one occurence,\n\nas it was in determining the 4.3 year period.\n However the pattern is not obvious after 1970.\n In fact, it is noted that 1 occurrence, in 1976, is associated with\n\nminimum rainfall, and 2 occurrences, in 1972/3 and 1982/3, are associated\n\nwith near average and minimum rainfall.\n\n\n \n\n  A hypothesis can be put forward to partially explain the positive\n\ncorrelation between rainfall and solar activity during the westerly\n\nphase of the QBO.\n The April rainfall can be explained in terms of precipitation\n\nresulting from the advance of cold fronts from the north over land ( Jamaica)\n\nwhich is being heated by solar radiation, which is in that part of its cycle\n\nwhere the intensity of radiation has nearly peaked  .\n\n\n 7. National Meteorological Service Climate Branch.\n\n Figure 7 shows the monthly variation of global radiation over Jamaica\n\nwith the radiation starting to peak in March. \n Thus April showers are caused by the coincidental occurrence of\n\ncold fronts and increased solar radiation over land.\n The cold air moves in under the warm air over land and forces moist\n\nair upward.\n The resulting uplifting of moist air leads to the formation of\n\ncumulonimbus clouds and eventual precipita<l>tion.\n The effect in March is not as pronounced, perhaps because of the\n\ntime lag required for solar heating to take effect.\n\n mum in the solar\n\ncycle, the mechanism above   will be amplified\n\ndue to slight increases in solar heating near solar maximum, and conversely\n\nit will be diminished during solar minimum.\n In this way there should be increased precipitation near solar\n\nmaximum and decreased precipitation near solar minimum.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '7a86fd6a-9e21-4c6d-9629-24bc3313c5bf', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.353236+00:00', 'english_score': 0.953998863697052, 'non_english_score': 0.046001136302948}

{'text': 'ABSTRACT\n A review of poisonings in Jamaica from 1980 to 1990 has been made\n\nbased on the analytical findings of the Toxicology Division of the Government\n\nChemist\'s Department of the Ministry of Health in Jamaica.\n Samples were received from a number of sources as the Department\n\nprovided analytical toxicology services to Government agencies, private\n\ninstitutions and physicians.\n Pesticides were implicated in 16.5% of the positive human poisoning\n\nsamples and 65% of the positive animal poisoning samples.\n In addition to modern synthetic drugs and pesticides, traditional\n\npoisons from botanical sources were also encountered.\n The authors feel that priority attention needs to be given to the\n\nenforcement of legal safety provisions for storage, transportation, sale and\n\nuse of pesticides as their availability is likely to increase with efforts\n\nfor greater food production in Jamaica. \n\n \n\n  Human and animal poisoning is generally associated with both\n\naccidental ingestion or exposure and criminal abuse of chemicals, drugs and\n\npesticides, as well as with poisons derived from plant materials.\n The nature of the poisons involved has become more diverse and\n\ncomplicated as a result of scientific advances over the years.\n The poisons encountered vary according to availability and aware\n\n<l> ness of their action on the body.\n The picture of poisonings therefore has changed gradually with the\n\nincrease in the number of new chemical products brought into general use.\n This phenomenon has been observed in Jamaica through studies and\n\nevaluations undertaken by the Government Chemist\'s Department over several\n\ndecades. \n\n  In addition to the historical development, recent technical\n\nadvances have made it imperative that sources of poisons be given more\n\nattention than has been traditionally done.\n The development programmes in Third World countries, including\n\nJamaica have led to an increasing use of a wider variety of chemicals\n\nincluding solvents, detergents, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and\n\nindustrial chemicals.\n The manufacture and use of these chemical agents have had an adverse\n\neffect on the environment as well as on man. \n\n\n 1.

American Journal of Industrial Medicine  , 1989,\n\n16, 167-177.  \n\n  They confirmed higher than acceptable levels of lead in air as\n\nwell as blood-lead concentrations much above the 40 mctg/dl limit set by the\n\nWorld Health Organization ( WHO).\n This situation is similar to that of several other developing\n\ncountries.  \n\n  A review of the data on blood lead analysis during the past nine\n\n( 9) years, revealed high values of blood lead concentration for the years\n\n1982, 1986 and 1987 ( Table 3).\n Figures for these three years represent extensive monitoring of\n\npersons known to be exposed to a situation of potential lead poisoning.\n The last two years ( 1989 and 1990) however, have revealed an\n\nincreased awareness and general demand for blood lead analysis as well.\n During this period only about 10% of the cases yielded blood lead\n\nlevels in excess of the 40 mcg/dl limit.\n This is indicative of endemic situation of lead poisoning at a low\n\nlevel. \n\n  It was also observed that routine occupational health surveys\n\ndone recently yielded blood lead levels averaging 10-20 mcg/dl with the\n\nhighest value of about 35 mcg/dl.\n All values were found to be below the WHO safety limit of 40 mcg/dl.\n Samples received from the Public Hospital in Spanish Town, St.\n\nCatherine typically had lead levels of 25 to 40 mcg/dl with some having even\n\nhigher values.\n In general, blood lead values for samples received form hospitals\n\nwere much higher than those of samples from various commercial agencies (\n\nnursing homes, medical laboratories etc.).\n This is probably because the hospital samples represented a weighted\n\nsample where the diagnosis of lead poisoning was based on a history of\n\nexposure. \n\n  Samples from other sources may be mainly for eliminating the\n\npossibility of lead poisoning.\n However, blood lead analysis using Graphite Furnace Atomic\n\nAbsorption Spectrophotometry is being offered as a regular service by\n\nthis Department which also indirectly serves to monitor the extent of lead\n\npoisoning. \n\n \n\n  The data on human and animal poisonings presented in Table 1 and\n\nTable 2 clearly indicates that accidental and criminal poisoning involving\n\npesticides is a major aspect of this problem in Jamaica.\n This country imported 1387 tonnes of pesticides in 1989 which covered\n\n167 insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, rodenticides and others which were\n\nsold as ready-to-use formulations.\n\n\nticides is still to be adequately regulated under the Pesticides Act 1974.\n Consequently, accidental human and animal poisoning remains a high\n\nprobability due to lack of both awareness and legal enforcement.\n\n\nwas presented by Professor Werner Ohe  of the World\n\nBank. \n 6.

Lewis, D. H.; Cowsar, D. H. Controlled Release Pesticides. Harbert\n\nB. ed., American Chemical Society, Washington D.C., USA, 1977, 1 \n 2\n\n  during the last decade to develop suitable controlled release\n\npesticides for use in the soil and on foliage to reduce ( 1) pesticide\n\napplication rates ( 2) pesticide levels in the environment and ( 3) pesticide\n\ntoxicity and to extend pesticide residual activity. \n\n\n \n\n  There are three main advantages of using controlled release\n\nformulations: ( i) reduced possibility of over or underdosing ( ii) much less\n\npesticide can be used for the same period of activity as a conven <l>\n\ntionally applied pesticide and ( iii) maintenance of an effective\n\nconcentration of pesticide for a prolonged period.\n The first advantage can be illustrated by Figure 1 where the\n\nconcentration of an active agent has been plotted as a function of time after\n\ndelivery in a conventional manner.\n Shortly after the agent is applied the concentration rises rapidly to\n\na maximum and then falls as the agent is metabolized or degraded.\n Two important concentration levels are to be noticed in this figure \x13\n\nthe effective concentration which is the minimum concentration necessary to\n\nproduce the desired effect and the toxic concentration above which side\n\neffects occur.\n It is important, therefore, to maintain a concentration of pesticide\n\nbetween the effective and toxic levels.\n Controlled release formulation is an ideal method of achieving this\n\nconcentration level. \n\n  To understand the significance of the other two advantages it is\n\nnecessary to consider the kinetics of degradation of active ingredients  when applied in a conventional way. \n\n\nAgri & Food Chem.  , 1990. \n In most cases, the degradation is a first order process and follows\n\nthe following rate law: \n\n  \n\n where x is the amount of active reagent in the environment.\n and x\n\n i  is the amount initially applied, the rate expression after\n\nintegration becomes \n\n  \n\n where t  e  is the time during which an effective quantity\n\nof the drug is present.\n Figure 2 illustrates the validity of expression 2 and the economy in\n\nthe usage of controlled release formulations. \n\n  Encapsulation processes can be divided into three categories:\n\n\n\n  1) Phase Separation \x13 in this process micro-capsules are formed\n\nby emulsifying or dispersing the core material in an immiscible continuous\n\nphase in which the wall material     dissolves and then separates from the continuous phase,\n\ndepositing around the core particles \n\n  2) Interfacial Reaction \x13 microcapsules are formed by emulsifying\n\nor dispersing the core material in an immiscible phase and then an\n\ninterfacial polymerization reaction results at the surface of the core\n\nparticles \n\n  3) Physical Methods \x13 wall material and core particles are\n\nphysically brought together and wall material flows around the core particles\n\nto form capsules.\n Matrix polymerization in which core material is embedded in a polymer\n\nmatrix during capsule formation falls in this category.\n\n\n  It should be noted that when a particular method of encapsulation\n\nis chosen one of the factors that must be considered is the end use of the\n\nformulation and thus the desired permeability of the membrane.\n Some of the parameters that affect capsular wall permeability and how\n\nthat can be manipulated are discussed in the literature.  \n 4.

C., U.S.A., 1974.  \n\n  Microencapsulation techniques have been used to prepare\n\nspherically-shaped reservoir devices for controlled release of pesticides.\n The most frequently used procedures include phase separation,\n\ncoacervation, spray coating, solvent evaporation from emulsions and\n\ninterfacial polymerisation.\n The choice of method depends mainly on the characteristics of the\n\npesticide and the release-controlling membrane.\n Common polymeric wall materials include polyamides, polyesters,\n\npolyureas, cellulose and gelatin.\n The most notable of the currently marketed microencapsulated products\n\nis the Penncap-M formulation developed by the Penwalt Corporation,  in which Methyl Parathion is encapsulated in the\n\npolyamide wall material. \n 5.

Starch-Xanthide method \x13 this method was essentially adopted\n\nfrom the published procedure. \n The encapsulated pesticide was filtered on a 60 mesh and washed with\n\nwater and pressed dry.\n The semi-dried mass was forced through a 15 mesh grid and left to dry\n\nto yield 70 g of product. \n\n B. Starch-Calcuim Chloride Method \x13 Shasha's published procedure  was followed to prepare the product.\n The encapsulated product was washed thoroughly with water and then\n\npressed dry.\n The semi-dried mass was forced through a 16 mesh grid and left to\n\ndry. \n\n \n\nof emulsifiable concentrate formulation of Diazinon and 35 cm  3  of\n\nwater were placed in a blender and mixed.\n of a 6% NaOH solution were added to gel the starch\n\nand mixing was continued.\n 2.5 g of boric acid were then added and mixed until a uniform rubbery\n\nmass was obtained.\n 11.25 g starch were then added and mixing continued until\n\nnon-adhering particles were formed.\n The particles were then forced through a 16 mesh grid and left to air\n\ndry to yield 34 g of product. \n\n  of the\n\nemulsifiable concentrated formulation of Diazinon Chlorpyrifos were added to\n\n11.25 g starch and thoroughly mixed in a blender.\n of boiling boric acid solution ( 1.25 g boric acid\n\nin 15 cm  3  water) were added.\n The mixture was blended again until a uniform gel formed.\n The mixture was poured onto plates in thin layers and left to dry.\n\n\n  Alternatively, boric was added to a slurry of starch in unheated\n\nwater.\n The mixture was then heated to gel approximately at 80 &degree; C.\n of an emulsifiable concentration formulation of\n\nDiazinon were added, followed by mixing.\n The mixture was poured onto plates in thin layers and left to dry.\n and boric acid\n\nmass was varied from 1.5 \x13 5 g. \n\n  of an emulsifiable\n\nconcentration formulation of Diazinon were added to 11.25 g starch in a\n\nblender and mixed.\n of boiling water were added to the mixture and\n\nthe latter blended.\n The gelled slurry was poured onto plated in thin layers to dry.\n\n\n  Analysis for Recovered Pesticide and Percent\n\nEncapsulation   \n\n  A. Calcium Adduct and Starch \x13 Borate 1 \x13 approximately 0.1 g of\n\nthe encapsulated product was weighed out accurately in 100 cm  3 \n\nconical flasks.\n of water were added and the product left to\n\nsoften for about 15 min.\n The flasks were then heated for about 10 min.\n At this stage the complexes were completely dissolved.\n 3\n\n portions of 15% dichloromethane/hexane solution.\n The extracts were dried and transferred to volumetric flasks.\n The contents were analysed for the pesticide using a gas\n\nchromatograph fitted with a flame photometric detector.\n This analysis gave the total amount of pesticide present,\n\nencapsulated and unencapsulated ( on the surface).\n The unencapsulated pesticide was determined by washing the granules\n\nwith a suitable solvent, collecting the washing and analysing the latter by\n\ngas chromatography. \n\n  B.

{'text': 'Effects of Flood Waters on the Planktonic Community of\n\nthe Hellshire Coast, Southeast Jamaica   \n\n\n 1 Received 4 September 1991, revision accepted 10 November 1991.\n\n \n\n \n\n  <Department of Botany, University of the  West Indies, Mona,\n\nKingston 7, Jamaica \n\n \n\n  Department of Zoology, University of the West Indies, Mona,\n\nKingston 7, Jamaica \n\n and \n\n \n\n  Department of Zoology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario N1G\n\n2W1, Canada \n\n \n\n  Between 24 May and 4 June 1986, the island of Jamaica experienced\n\nup to 635 mm of rainfall producing island-wide flooding.\n Planktonic communities along the south coast were studied before and\n\nafter the flooding.\n Flood waters from Kingston Harbour flowed southwest along the\n\nHellshire coast as far as Wreck Reef, but were confined within 4 km of the\n\nshore.\n Water in the bays along the lower Hellshire coast remained clear and\n\nunaffected by harbour water, although planktonic communities there showed\n\nmarked changes.\n The Port Royal Cays area and much of the shelf was unaffected.\n During the flood, the normal gradient of decline in planktonic\n\nindices ( biomass, abundance, and community similarity) with distance from\n\nthe harbour was disrupted.\n The extent of flooding was evident from dramatic reductions in\n\nsalinity and increases in extinction coefficient; temperatures were lowered\n\nby only 1 to 2 &degree; C.\n Flood effects were confined to the upper water column; whereas,\n\nsurface salinity and phytoplankton were dramatically changed, they remained\n\nlargely unaffected at 7 m depth.\n In surface waters, the number of phytoplankton cells increased up to\n\n4 x 10  6  per liter ( 5 times greater than normal) while biomass\n\nincreased to 30 mg Chl.  a  / m  3  ( 10 times normal) and\n\nprimary production reached 20.5 mg C/m  3  hr ( 20 times normal).\n These large increases in both biomass and primary production occurred\n\nprimarily in the nanoplankton size fraction ( 2-20 &mu; m) which was\n\ndominated by  Protoperidunum  spp.\n Within a week however, the larger net plankton ( &gt; 20 &mu; m)\n\nassumed dominance.\n These high values were short-lived as phytoplankton communities\n\nreturned to normal within two weeks of the flood.\n Zooplankton abundances at first decreased sharply in response to\n\nflooding (  e.g.  , from &approximate-sign; 20,000 to 200/m  3\n\n ) , but reattained normal values within four weeks following the flood.\n , Harbour mouth, Great Salt Pond)\n\nthere was a subsequent 10-fold increase in zooplankton abundance ( up to\n\n209,000/m  3  ) comprising mainly larval stages.\n Thus, return to nonflood conditions was achieved at different rates\n\nfor the various physical and biological parameters. \n\n  Keywords: community diversity; disturbance; flooding;\n\nJamaica; marine plankton; productivity; salinity.  \n\n  , from 24 May to 5 June 1986\n\nthe island of Jamaica experienced heavy rains from a stationary tropical\n\nfront.\n Over 350 mm of rain fell in the catchment area of the Rio Cobre, 275\n\nmm of rain fell in Kingston and St. Andrew, while a maximum of 635 mm of rain\n\nwas recorded at the Norman Manley International Airport.\n All the rivers were in spate and large volumes of silt and organic\n\nladen water poured into Hunts Bay, Kingston Harbour, and out along the\n\nHellshire coast.\n Smaller volumes of fresh water also poured into the Great Salt Pond\n\nand the bays along Hellshire.\n This occurrence prompted an investigation into the effects of\n\nextreme land runoff and flood waters on the plankton populations of the area.\n Studies already being conducted were intensified to monitor these new\n\nconditions.\n A fuller account of planktonic communities of the area under\n\nnormal conditions is presented elsewhere ( see Chisholm & Roff 1990a,b;\n\nClarke & Roff 1990; Hopcroft & Roff 1990; Roff  et al.  1990; Lindo\n\n1991). \n\n  Planktonic organisms are important indicators in the marine\n\nenvironment due to their prominence in coastal and estuarine communities and\n\ntheir wide geographical distribution.\n In fact, planktonic communities are often the surest means of\n\nrecognizing water masses of different origins (  e.g.  , Raymont\n\n1983).\n In locations such as the Hellshire coast, where preliminary\n\nobservations indicate rapid deleterious changes in the coral reef and\n\nseagrass communities ( Head & Hendry 1985), there is a need to\n\ninvestigate the causes of these changes.\n Although rainfall and flooding of the magnitude observed in June 1986\n\ndoes not occur with great regularity,   such\n\noccasions provide an opportunity to recognize different sources of water\n\nflowing into the marine environment which may normally be undetected but yet\n\nare significant.\n For example, such flood events permit the determination of the\n\nmaximum extent of influence of polluted Kingston Harbour waters in the\n\nregion. \n\n \n\n  The Hellshire coast ( Fig. 1) lies immediately south-east of the\n\neutrophic Kingston Harbour ( Moore & Sander 1982).\n The Harbour is influenced by a number of rivers and gullies\n\nwhich drain Kingston and St. Andrew.\n Hunts Bay, a semi-enclosed part of Kingston Harbour, receives land\n\nrunoff via the Rio Cobre, which in turn drains clay/silt loam agricul <l>\n\ntural lands of St. Catherine, and via the Duhaney River and the Sandy Gully\n\nwhich drain a major part of Kingston and St. Andrew ( Fig. 1).\n The total area of Kingston Harbour and Hunts Bay is\n\n&approximate-sign; 50 km  2  . \n\n  The 27 km long coastline of Hellshire consists of a number of\n\nsmall bays with reef systems stretching across their entrances.\n The whole area is relatively shallow with depths ranging form 1\n\nto 16 m.\n Some of these bays receive significant inputs of fresh ground water\n\nfrom aquifers, and water can be observed freely percolating through the\n\nporous limestone rocks of the substratum ( which possesses little or now\n\noverburden).\n The land behind many of these bays supports small mangrove lagoons\n\nand salinas which become periodically inundated.\n , Reeson 1971), the largest\n\nmangrove lagoon along Hellshire, is located behind Hellshire Bay.\n Water from Great Salt Pond enters Hellshire Bay only via a 12 m\n\nwide man-made channel. \n\n  Temperature and salinity gradients in the region are generally\n\nweak. Temperature ranges seasonally from 27 to 29 &degree; C, and salinity\n\nfrom a minimum of &approximate- sign; 33 &per-thousand; at the Harbour mouth\n\nto 36 &per-thousand; towards the edge of the shelf.\n There is little evidence of vertical stratification ( maximum\n\ntemperature profile range is &lt; 1 &degree; C).\n Nitrate concentrations, though highly variable, range from &lt; 0.1 (\n\nlimit of detection) to &gt; 8 &mu; M ( mean 1.3 &mu; M) at the Harbour mouth,\n\nto &lt; 0.1 &mu; M to 0.81 &mu; M ( mean 0.3 &mu; M) toward the edge of the\n\nshelf ( Hopcroft & Roff 1990, B. Morrison, pers. comm.). \n\n \n\n \n \x13 A total of 23 stations was sampled throughout the study area ( Fig.\n\n1).\n This included one station at South East Cay ( 23), part of the Port\n\nRoyal Cays system which is unaffected by Harbour outflow ( Hopcroft & Roff\n\n1990), and three stations across the mouth of Kingston harbour ( 1-3).\n The remaining 19 stations were grouped as bay stations: those lying\n\nwithin the reef barrier and close to the shore ( 4-10);  " inshore"\n\n stations: those lying &approximate- sign; 500 m from shore ( 11-16);\n\nand  " offshore"  stations: those lying &approximate-sign; 3\n\nkm from shore and outside the reef system ( 17-22).\n Regular sampling which had commenced in November 1985, was being\n\nconducted at monthly intervals and continued after the flood of May/June\n\n1986, until March 1987.\n During June 1986, commencing immediately after the flood rains,\n\nsampling was intensified to once per week at 6 stations ( 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7)\n\nlocated around the mouth of Kingston Harbour and the Great Salt Pond, because\n\nthe most visible flood effects were observed in this area. \n\n  Physical parameters, salinity, temperature, and extinction\n\ncoefficient ( calculated from light intensities, using a Licor light\n\nmeter), were measured at each station along with plankton collections. \n\n  Phytoplankton was collected in 6 liter Niskin bottles from 1 m\n\ndepth at all stations, and additionally from 7 m at  " inshore"\n\n and  " offshore"  stations.\n Phytoplankton biomass was determined as size fractionated chlorophyll\n\n a  ( net plankton &gt; 20 &mu; m, nano plankton 2.7-20 &mu; m and\n\npico plankton 0.7-2.7 &mu; m) using a Turner 111 fluorometer ( Parsons\n\n et al.  1984).\n Size fractionated primary production was also estimated using\n\nthe  14  C technique following methods of Hopcroft and Roff ( 1990).\n Phytoplankton identification to generic level and enumeration was\n\nperformed on 500 ml Lugold preserved whole water samples. \n\n  Zooplankton sampling involved 5 minute surface tows with a\n\n200 &mu; m net at 16 of the 23 stations ( excluding the  " inshore"\n\n group, 11-16, Fig. 1).\n Vertical hauls from 1 m off the bottom were also conducted at the\n\n " offshore"  stations.\n Zooplankton samples were preserved in 10 percent formalin and later\n\nidentified and enumerated.\n The filtering efficiency of the 200 &mu; m net ( which ranged\n\nfrom 50 to 80%) was applied in the calculation of total zooplankton numbers.\n Biomass determinations were also made using preserved material, as\n\nweight loss with preservation was found to be negligible in this area (\n\nChisholm & Roff 1990a). \n\n  In order to determine whether spatial and temporal\n\nvariability of the plankton was real or due only to sampling error, sampling\n\nvariability ( N = 5) of bottle casts ( phytoplankton) and net hauls (\n\nzooplankton) was examined.\n Counts of the total number of organisms were made and the coefficient\n\nof variation ( C. V.) was calculated.\n Sampling variability ( at a station) for phytoplankton was\n\n&approximate-sign; 10 percent, while for zooplankton sampling it was\n\n&approximate-sign; 15 percent.\n Subsample variation was similarly calculated on replicate\n\nsubsamples ( N = 7) taken from a single sample; it was &approximate-sign; 3\n\npercent for phytoplankton and &approximate-sign; 7 percent for\n\nzooplankton.\n Analysis of variance tests were performed using the statistical\n\nprogram Statgraphics ( STSC Inc. 1986). \n\n  In order to establish the levels of similarity of communities\n\nbetween stations, two indices were calculated for the entire plankton\n\ncommunity from phytoplankton genera and zooplankton taxon data.\n These were: Jaccard Community Coefficient ( JCC) ( Clifford &\n\nStephenson 1975) and Percent Similarity Coefficient ( PSC) ( Whittaker &\n\nFairbanks 1958, Lee & McAlice 1979).\n JCC neglects conjoint absences and is based on presence and absence,\n\ntherefore crediting single rare occurrences with as much weight as\n\noccurrences which are numerous or regular; in contrast, PSC neglects single\n\nrare occurrences.\n Hence, employing both these coefficients may balance their individual\n\nweaknesses.\n Both coefficients were calculated by comparing species at all\n\nother stations to stations 1 ( west of the harbour mouth) and station 6 (\n\nGreat Salt Pond). \n\n \n\n  The occurrence of the flood clearly indicated the existence of a\n\nnumber of sources of waters to the Hellshire area, namely: Kingston harbour,\n\nthe Great Salt Pond, offshore shelf waters, and runoff into the individual\n\nbays themselves. \n\n  Following presentation of visual observations during the flood,\n\nwe shall compare parameter means for the entire sampling period under normal\n\nconditions (  i.e.  , from seven months before and nine months\n\nafter the flood, but excluding the flood affected months, with values\n\nobtained when the flood effects were at their peak ( for physical param <l>\n\neters and phytoplankton \x13 6 June).\n Finally we will report weekly changes in parameters as physical\n\neffects of the flood dissipated. \n\n \n \x13 The distribution of the flood waters throughout the study area\n\n( Fig. 1) was observed, during one hour flights, from a light aircraft on 6\n\nand 8 June 1986 ( after cessation of rainfall) at &approximate-sign; 0900\n\nhours, and again on 15 June at &approximate-sign; 1100 hours. \n\n  Conditions on 6 and 8 June were similar; Hunts Bay was full of\n\nmuddy-brown water and plant debris, except for a patch of red-brown water,\n\ntypical of red mangrove areas, backed up in the Dawkins Pond area.\n Muddy-brown water in a distinct plume flowed out of Hunts Bay and\n\nacross the Harbour in the direction of the Norman Manley International\n\nAirport ( Fig. 1).\n The Port Royal mangal had its normal red-brown water but it was\n\ndistinct from the muddy-brown water of the Hunts Bay plume which had not\n\nentered this area.\n Turbid waters ( but less so than the Hunts Bay plume) were observed\n\nthroughout the outer Harbour ( west of the Airport) and seen to flow out of\n\nthe harbour.\n This Harbour water was more turbid towards the western side of the\n\nHarbour mouth ( near Lazaretto Cairn). \n\n  The plume of turbid water from the Harbour mouth extended east as\n\nfar as Gun Cay and immediately outside of Drunkenmans Cay.\n Both South and South East Cays were surrounded by clear water.\n The turbid water from the Harbour mouth then flowed southwest along\n\nthe Hellshire coast, extending &approximate-sign; 4 km from shore as far\n\nas Wreck Reef.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '2dd89a2b-600e-4126-8d24-5e6e229b927a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.359923+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9463699460029602, 'non_english_score': 0.053630053997039795}

l of toluene was added to each vial to prevent the\n\ngrowth of bacteria.\n The procedure was repeated without ACC being added to each\n\nvial-control ( Table 1).\n The vials were sealed with a rubber septum, and incubated at 30\n\n&degree; C for 4 h.\n At the end of the incubation period, 1.0 ml of air was removed form\n\nthe head space of each vial and injected onto the gas chromatograph for\n\ndetection of ethylene.\n\n\n  For quantitative analysis of the ethylene produced, a standard\n\ncurve was obtained by measuring the amount of ethylene produced form varying\n\nconcentrations ( 0.1 mM \x13 1.0 mM) of a 1mM stock solution of ACC.\n was achieved by a slight\n\nmodification of the method of Lizada and Yang  ,\n\nwhere ACC is converted to ethylene in the presence of HgCl  2  ( 1\n\n&mu; mol) and 5% Na-hypochlorite in saturated NaOH ( 2:1 V/V). \n 1979,\n\n100, 140.  \n\n  Effect of Galactose on the Synthesis of Phylene in the\n\nPresence of Added ACC   \n\n  The experiment performed here was basically the same as\n\ndescribed in the previous section, the difference being that ACC at a final\n\nconcentration of 4.5 mM was added to all the vials, while galactose at a\n\nfinal concentration of 4.5 mM was added to one vial of each group ( Table 2);\n\nafter 4 h, ethylene was detected as previously described.   \n\n  Effect of Galactose on the Synthesis of Ethylene in\n\nthe Absence of Added ACC   \n\n  Since the seeds of the coffee berry produced more ethylene than\n\nthe pulp ( Table 1), only the matured unripe seeds were used in this experi\n\n<l> ment.\n Triplicate samples were used in this experiment.\n Triplicate samples were set up where each vial contained 2g of coffee\n\nseeds with varying concentrations of galactose ( Table 3).\n The final concentration of galactose ranged form 0mM \x13 25 mM.\n For comparison glucose was included at 25 mM in one experiment.\n Buffer concentration was 0.048 M citrate/0.141 M phosphate, pH 5.0.\n\n  \n\n  Kinetic Studies on the EFE: Testing Galactose as a\n\nPossible Inhibitor   \n\n  The studies used ACC as substrate at concentrations which\n\nvaried form 0.1M \x13 1.0 M.\n Three grams ( 3g) of the coffee seeds were used, and galactose was\n\npresent at a fixed concentration of 20 mM.\n Buffer concentration was 0.048 M citrate/0.141 M phosphate, pH 5.0.\n\n\n\n \n\n  was\n\nconfirmed by assaying for the production of ethylene by the pulp ( pericarp\n\ntissue) and seeds of the coffee berry.\n Data from Table 1 show the amount of ethylene produced form the ripe\n\npulp, unripe pulp, ripe seeds and unripe seeds in the presence of added ACC.\n Ethylene was formed by the seeds of the berry whether ACC was added\n\nor not.\n In contrast ripe pulp produced ethylene only in the presence of added\n\nACC.\n The results indicate that there is more EFE in the seeds of the\n\ncoffee berry than in the pulp, as the amount of ethylene produced by the\n\nseeds ( 2.51 &mu; g/g fresh weight) is 1.67 times more than in the pulp (\n\n1.50 &mu; g/g fresh weight). \n\n  The effect of galactose on the EFE ( from pulp and seeds) in the\n\npresence of added ACC is shown in Table 2.\n These results show that when galactose and ACC are present at a con\n\n<l> centration of 4.5 mM, there is no apparent effect on the EFE, as the\n\nproduction of ethylene remains constant in both the pulp and seeds of\n\nthe coffee berry.\n A decision was made to examine the effects of galactose when\n\nsubstrate levels for the EFE were restricted to endogenous ACC only.\n A different result was seen when galactose was present and ACC\n\nwas not added ( Table 3).\n Data form Table 3 clearly indicate that as the concentration of\n\ngalactose is increased from 0 mM- 25 mM, there is a decrease in the\n\nproduction of ethylene form the endogenous levels of ACC that must have been\n\npresent.\n It is only at these low levels of ACC ( i.e. endogenous ACC\n\nconcentration) that galactose inhibits the EFE. \n\n  ) where the\n\nconcentration of ACC varied from 0.1 &mu; M up to 1.0 &mu; M, with a fixed\n\nconcentration ( 20 mM) of galactose.\n Figure 1 reveals that galactose in fact inhibit the EFE, with the\n\neffect being more pronounded at lower ACC concentrations.\n The type of inhibition shown here is indicative of a mixed\n\ninhibition. \n\n  It should be noted that values shown for ACC concentration (\n\nFigure 1) do not take into   account the\n\nendogenous ACC concentration.\n Hence the results have mainly qualitative rather than quantitative\n\nsignificance.\n This particular result is of interest, as it demonstrates galactose,\n\na product of &beta;-galactosidase activity  , as\n\nhaving an inhibitory effect on the production of ethylene.\n Glucose at 25 mM concentration also had an inhibitory effect on the\n\nproduction of ethylene ( Table 4). \n\n\n1993, 32, 355.   \n\n \n\n  Ethylene synthesis can be regulated at two points in the\n\npathway, i.e., the conversion of methionine to ACC and the conversion of ACC\n\nto ethylene.\n Galactose was found to inhibit the production of ethylene by\n\naffecting the conversion of ACC to ethylene.\n This is evident from data presented in Table 3 and Figure 1.\n\n\n , making it possible for an increase in the production of ethylene.\n\n\n ,\n\n1980, 105, 492. \n However, the production of ethylene falls considerably in fruits\n\nthat are overripe  .\n This fall in ethylene production is not accompanied by a fall\n\nin the level of ACC  .\n Therefore, the conversion of ACC to ethylene is likely to be\n\nimpaired in overripe fruits.\n It is being suggested that the production of galactose by the\n\nactivity of &beta;-galactosidase ( an enzyme that is also involved in\n\nthe ripening process  ) could be a regulating\n\nfactor that influences the production of ethylene by inhibiting the EFE.\n Consideration has to be given to the fact that the concentration of\n\nfree sugars ( i.e. monosaccharides) is increased as fruits ripen.\n It could be that galactose alone does not contribute to the\n\nregulation of ethylene synthesis.\n Glucose at a concentration of 25 mM also affected the EFE (\n\nTable 4).\n Therefore, it is quite possible that other glycosidases such as\n\n&alpha;- and &beta;-glucosidase, &alpha;- and &beta;-mannosidase are also\n\ninvolved in the regulation of ethylene synthesis by producing the\n\nmonosaccharides glucose and mannose respectively. \n\n  The actual mechanism by which galactose affects the EFE was not\n\ninvestigated.\n is known to\n\ninhibit ethylene synthesis. \n 1979,\n\n145, 293. \n have reported that\n\nthere are two possible sites for the production of ethylene in cells that are\n\ncultured  in vitro  ; \n\n ( i) an external site located at the plasma membrane that is very\n\nsensitive to high osmotica and \n\n ( ii) an intracellular site that is unaffected by high osmotica. \n\n  ACC can be converted to ethylene at both sites.\n The concentration of mannitol ( 0.8 M) used in those experiments\n\n to produce osmotic shock is high when compared\n\nwith that used in this study ( 10mM - 25 mM galactose). \n That such low concentrations of galactose can cause plasmolysis is\n\nquite unlikely.\n The manner in which galactose affects the EFE is therefore unlikely\n\nto be the same as that described by Bouzayen et al. \n A more intensive scientific investigation would by needed in order\n\nto ex<l>plain the mode of action of galactose with re<l>spect to the\n\ninhibition of the EFE.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'ea3d621d-f42c-4aaf-98b8-f9f34561bd22', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.361255+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9579703211784363, 'non_english_score': 0.04202967882156372}
{'text': "Energy Requirements and Supplies for Rural Development\n\n  \n\n  With the exception of Trinidad ( oil producer/exporter) and Haiti\n\n( very minimal industrial activity), energy-use patterns in Caribbean\n\ncountries show remarkable similarities, especially in rural areas.\n In unique ways, the command economy in Cuba somewhat changes the rural\n\nenergy consumption pattern, but generally, options for applying renewable\n\nenergy to rural development need neither be many nor very country-specific\n\namong the states of the region. \n\n  In the Caribbean context, the pervasive assumption that rural\n\nareas are more amenable to supply by small renewable sources than are urban\n\nareas, is open to question.\n Notably, whenever centralized supplies of electrical power or\n\npetroleum products are significantly disrupted many households in urban\n\nCaribbean areas readily make the temporary change to renewable sources of\n\nenergy for domestic purposes.\n The phenomenon serves to indicate a major potential for renewables\n\nlinked to small appliances to play an important role even in the urban\n\ncentres of this humid tropical region. \n\n  In any event, there are many opportunities for applying renewables\n\nto urban areas because ( 1) most urban dwellings have only one floor, and\n\nthus have direct rooftop access to sunlight for all occupants; ( 2) most\n\nurban dwellings occupy less than 40% of the property on which they are\n\nlocated; ( 3) more than 25% of the urban yard spaces in the region are\n\ncovered by lawn grass ( a renewable biomass resource); and ( 4) most urban\n\ndomestic energy applications do not require high enthalpy energy sources.\n\n\n\n  Although, on balance, the rural areas offer the best\n\nopportunities for applying renewables, the potential in urban areas should\n\nnot be ignored. \n\n  In a major UNDP/CARICOM Secretariat study on the feasibility of\n\nestablishing a Caribbean Regional Renewable Energy Development Station (\n\nRREDS), Minott  et al.  ( 1985) carried out comprehensive sub-sector\n\nlevel projections of renewables market potential and annual US dollar savings\n\npossible over a 30-year period in the Caribbean region, based on\n\nextrapolations from analyses of the enthalpies and quantities of commercial\n\nenergy usage in Jamaica at the start of the last decade.\n Table 16.1 is a summary of these projections for both urban and rural\n\nareas of the Caribbean ( excluding Cuba). \n\n  In 1984, the primary demand for rural energy was for agricultural\n\nproduction, sugar processing, cooking, lighting, refrigeration and\n\ntransportation.\n An estimate of the BOE demand may be made by extrapolating from the\n\ndata given in Table 16.1. \n\n \n\n  The industrial world of the late nineteenth and the twentieth\n\ncenturies initially designed its industries around non-renewable fossil\n\nfuels: oil, gas and coal. As the enterprises expanded, their demand for these\n\ndwindling resources precipitated a large international trading activity\n\ninvolving the purchase of fossil fuel from the resources of the developing\n\nworld at prices well below those that would be appropriate if rational\n\nmarginal costings were applied. \n\n  The countries of the Caribbean group, in trying to improve the\n\nquality of life for their citizens, have increasingly adopted the lifestyles\n\nof the industrialized world, including heavy dependency on fossil fuels.\n But among the stark differences between this group and the\n\nindustrialized country models which it seeks to emulate are ( 1) the\n\navailability of capital; ( 2) political power and international influence; (\n\n3) technological prowess related to the harnessing of the factors of\n\nproduction within the context of the Caribbean environment; ( 4) experience\n\nin implementing policies of self-reliance without disrupting the social\n\norder; ( 5) experience in commercializing local innovation by private and\n\npublic concern; and ( 6) the relative availabilities of alternatives to\n\nfossil fuels. \n\n  In the critical field of energy, the Caribbean, which in past\n\ncenturies was completely reliant on renewables, almost completely discarded\n\nits heritage.\n This was not necessary for industrialization.\n In developing countries such as the People's Republic of China, fuel\n\nand energy production benefited considerably from the wholesale\n\nadherence to the continued but modernized use of renewables, especially in\n\nrural areas by way of small hydro- power, biogas and woodfuel in conjunction\n\nwith necessary use of available non-renewables. \n\n  There is an assumption that increased fuel and energy use per\n\ncapita is essential to economic growth.\n While this may be so in some cases it is surely not so in the\n\nmajority of cases.\n The problem is that we have almost invariably equated energy with\n\nhigh-grade fuels and electricity.\n way we\n\nhave forgotten or ignored equally simple ways to perform work without\n\nelectricity.\n As the volume of work to be done increases with population,\n\nconsumption of electrical power and petroleum fuels increases\n\ndisproportionately to the actual end uses.\n Consequently, the volume of high-grade fuels that has to be wasted in\n\norder to provide electrical power at 15% to 30% efficiency climbs at a\n\ngreater than linear rate.\n To put it bluntly, the shallow economic dictum that equates growth\n\nwith energy consumption per capita results from a failure to understand the\n\nsecond law of thermodynamics and the degree to which electrical energy is\n\nabused due to ignorance about the options for performing work economically.\n\n \n\n  For the Caribbean, with the exception of Trinidad, the only\n\noptions are the renewables.\n Their abundance is such that we are well placed to be among the first\n\nbeneficiaries of the non-nuclear energy options which the entire planet will\n\nhave to rely upon in the foreseeable future.\n What abounds in the region by way of year-round sunlight, land and\n\naquatic resources in the continental countries, wind energy in the eastern\n\nstates and relatively reliable rainfall are the \x18raw materials' on which the\n\nworld's new options must invariably be based. \n\n  Even in the cases of Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados, which\n\nproduce fossil oil and gas, it is advisable that these non-renewable but\n\nvaluable assets be husbanded for use in ( 1) meeting necessary present energy\n\nneeds conservatively; ( 2) generating investment capital to provide\n\nalternatives for their replacement in the future; ( 3) manufacturing \n\n\x18nobler'  products which will be more resilient in sustaining\n\neconomic well-being than fossil products can ever be; ( 4) building up energy\n\nreserves for meeting emergency needs for high- grade fossil fuels in national\n\ncrises within the future of renewables; and ( 5) directly assisting the\n\ntransition to biomass and other solar technologies on a phased basis by\n\nproviding materials such as fertilizers, plastics, etc. \n\n  The Caribbean's bequest of renewable energy resources is such\n\nthat the region can, in a generation, be living off its own natural energy\n\nincome rather that continuing to exist on \x18oil credits' generously provided\n\nby Venezuela, Mexico, Nigeria, and Trinidad and Tobago.\n Indeed, it is a commendable feature of the credit facilities offered\n\nunder these oil supply agreements that capital investments in new sources of\n\nenergy in the consuming countries may, to an appreciable extent, be offset\n\nagainst due repayments.\n Unfortunately, however, these facilities for renewable energy\n\ndevelopment remain, for the most part, under- or unutilised because there is\n\nno viable local capacity to effect a meaningful programme of renewable energy\n\ndevelopment in the region despite the many ( but woefully fragmented) efforts\n\nof the agencies. \n\n  Of course, there is yet another awkward non-economic factor\n\ncontributing to world- wide tardiness in large-scale development of\n\nrenewables, especially in the Third World.\n Renewables are, by their very nature, anti-monopolistic, more\n\ndemocratic and less amenable to centralized control.\n This has its political implications.\n At the working level, there tends to be an incestuous institutional\n\nrelationship between second-level policy makers, regulatory bodies, executing\n\norganizations and implementing agencies, largely brought about by the\n\nscarcity of available technical personnel to staff the various agencies.\n relationships work\n\nagainst diversity in thinking, reinforce non-innovative, non-critical\n\nconformity and perpetuate increased reliance on fossil fuels and electrical\n\nenergy within large, highly centralized systems vulnerable to undemocratic\n\nmanipulation. \n\n  The argument that the economies of scale of large power supply\n\nsystems makes them more suitable to meeting national energy demand is of\n\nquestionable validity.\n When one examines the distribution of electrical power in relatively\n\nindustrialized Jamaica and Trinidad, compared to far less industrialized\n\nHaiti, the most striking similarity is the small proportion of the  tariff dollar which is actually paid for energy.\n So much of the residential tariffs are to pay for ( 1) transmission\n\nand distribution losses plus power station losses; ( 2) subsidizing\n\nindustrial and agricultural power supply; ( 3) paying for energy waste at\n\nlevels which would not be typical if smaller, more efficient renewable\n\nsystems were doing the same work; ( 4) maintaining idle reserves; ( 5) paying\n\nfor new capital equipment which will reduce jobs and trap large amounts of\n\ncapital, thus directing investment away from other critical targets for the\n\ndevelopment efforts; and ( 6) the negative effects of mis-timed demand\n\nforecasts, interest, escalations, strikes, administration and competition for\n\nforeign exchange to purchase fossil fuels from overseas. \n\n  Inevitably, we have to confront the fact that probably no more\n\nthan about 12% of electricity use in the Caribbean really requires energy in\n\nthe electro-magnetic form.\n However, one hastens to add that where the potential for cheap\n\nhydro-electric power exists, this form of energy should be exploited fully\n\nsince the development process can only benefit from this.\n Dominica, Cayenne, Suriname, Guyana, Haiti, Belize and St Vincent\n\ncould well rationalize their industrial potential for producing high-grade\n\npower in the form of electricity from hydro resources. \n\n  Trinidad and Barbados, despite their hydrocarbon resources and\n\nrelatively dense levels of population, may need to concentrate on those\n\ntechnologies and industries which can begin the process of exploiting their\n\nrenewable resources in the forms of direct solar power, biomass and wind.\n In similar fashion, Jamaica, Antigua, the Bahamas, Belize, the\n\nDominican Republic and most of the Windward Islands have the options of\n\ndirect solar, biomass and, in the case of the eastern states, wind energy.\n\n\n\n  In the Caribbean context, ocean energy and geothermal resources,\n\nthough promising, are inherently disposed to trapping large blocks of capital\n\ninto low levels of economic production for too long.\n Furthermore, ocean thermal and geothermal sources do not create any\n\nsignificant employment and are not as environmentally benign as might at\n\nfirst appear. \n\n  So, what must be done regionally?\n Briefly, these countries need to set out together to develop small\n\nenergy systems based on their affordable and sustainable renewables.\n But this must be done incrementally \x13 first, by supplementing\n\nexisting systems, then by deliberately allowing renewables to supplant\n\nexisting systems.\n The approach needs to be structured, conducted by a comprehensively\n\nendowed body of experts in collaboration with existing institutions.\n The proposed programme would ensure the thorough public education and\n\ndemocratic and commercial participation of the Caribbean peoples whose lives\n\nwill be affected by the development of new energy alternatives. \n\n  Research and Development in Rural Energy Supplies\n\n  \n\n  Table 16.1 lists the types of renewable and fossil resources on a\n\ncountry-by-country basis and gives an approximate picture of the distribution\n\nof energy resources in the sub- region.\n Research and development should be designed to service the technology\n\nneeds of each country according to its indigenous energy resources.\n The particular choices of technology are recommended on the perceived\n\ndistribution of exploitable resources and on the demonstrable nature and\n\nmagnitude of energy demands for each country. \n\n  In terms of renewable resources already being or likely to be\n\nexploited, Table 16.1 indicates the following order of technological\n\npriorities: ( 1) forestry/silvicultural biomass, including natural wood\n\nsources and cultivated wood and foliage sources for fermentation to fuels,\n\netc.; ( 2) sugar cane and grasses biomass from existing plantations and from\n\ncultivation of enhanced varieties and species for alcohol, fuel gases and\n\nsolid fuels; ( 3) direct solar for low enthalpy heat production and also for\n\nhigh temperature and electrical purposes; ( 4) small hydro-power ( below 5\n\nMW) and conventional hydro-power; ( 5) wind energy; ( 6) geothermal energy (\n\nnot truly a renewable technology); ( 7) rice-derived fuels; ( 8) wave energy;\n\n( 9) tidal energy; and ( 10) ocean thermal energy conversion. \n\n  This ordering of the technological priorities must be matched by:\n\n\n\n  1 Complementary facilities for technological developments in the\n\nuses of immediate by-products of the energy processes specific to the\n\npriorities determined above.\n These facilities must, in general, serve to promote the extraction of\n\nmaximum economic and commercial benefits from the indigenous energy resources\n\nin an environmentally benign way;

( AECL)\n\nSLOWPOKE-2 research reactor with a maximum rated flux of 10  12  n\n\ncm  - 2  s  - 1  for NAA.\n There are four Canberra and Ortec coaxial high purity Ge detector\n\nsystems and one Ortec HPGe low energy photon spectrometer ( LEPS) system\n\ninterfaced to either IBM compatibles or a DEC 380 computer.\n Spectra are analysed with EG&G Ortec software for DEC ( GELIGAM) and\n\nIBM ( OMNIGAM), EPAA ( Kennedy, Ecole Polytechnique).\n The IAEA gamma spectrometry software package GANAAS is now being\n\nincluded in the laboratory as an option for spectrum analysis.\n The laboratory computers are networked, and in-house menu-driven user\n\ninterfaces are available to provide a choice of MCA emulation, spectrum\n\nanalysis and quantification software at each workstation. \n\n \n\n  A Siemens FK60-04 X-ray tube with a molybdenum anode and a\n\nKristalloflex high voltage generator as the primary source of X-rays is used.\n The system is configured for secondary target excitation usually with\n\nzirconium as the secondary target. An EG&G Ortec SLP 10180 Si(Li) detector\n\nwith a FWHM of 180 eV at 5.9 keV and 0.025 mm Be window, and associated\n\nspectroscopy electronics interfaced to a Canberra Series 35+ multi-channel\n\nanalyzer is used for spectrum collection.\n\n\n \n\n  A Dionex 4500i ion chromatography unit with an automatic sample\n\nchanger is used.\n\n\n  &black-square; a pulsed electrochemical detector PED for the\n\ndetermination of anions such as nitrate, chloride, sulphate, etc. and cations\n\nsuch as ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, etc. by conductivity\n\nmeasurements. \n\n  &black-square; a variable wavelength detector VDM-II with a\n\nmicrolitre volume quartz cell and fibre optics for light transfer.\n This is presently used for the determination of transition elements\n\nby spectrophotometry after complexation with 4-(2- pyridylazo)resorcinol.\n\n\n\n \n\n  The electronics laboratory provides the Centre with the\n\ncapability to maintain and repair much of the instrumentation within the\n\nfacility.\n The laboratory is also involved in the development of peripheral\n\nsystems associated with nuclear spectrometry measurements.\n For example, a computer controlled random access storage system has\n\nbeen designed and built for storage and retrieval of 180 samples from\n\nindividually coded sites.\n The pneumatic system of the storage site is connected to the\n\nSLOWPOKE-II irradiation pneumatic unit so that samples can be transferred\n\ndirectly from the reactor to the storage areas.\n An onboard computer keeps a database of site status.\n The prototype was developed under a research contract from the IAEA.\n\n\n\n \n\n  The Centre has operated a pilot facility for the monitoring of\n\noccupational exposure to radiation using thermoluminescence dosimetry since\n\n1984.\n The funds for the equipment - a Vinten Universal Toledo 654D TLD\n\nReader, 623  90  Sr irradiator and 6221E annealing unit - were\n\nprovided by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA).\n During this phase, about 150 radiation workers from hospitals,\n\nlaboratories and industries were monitored.\n The success of this programme lead to the expansion of the project in\n\n1992 to create a national facility for monitoring on an island-wide basis.\n This is being funded by the IAEA, U.W.I. and the Government of\n\nJamaica. The IAEA funded the purchase of a Harshaw 6600 automated TLD reader\n\nwith a built in  90  Sr irradiation station.\n Dose evaluation is done with a TLD Glow Curve deconvolution programme\n\nand Harshaw REMS ( radiation evaluation and management system) software.\n The possibility of extending the service within the Caribbean Region\n\nis also being explored. \n\n \n\n \n\n  The Centre is involved in several national programmes in which\n\nvery large SQL compliant relational databases are generated, stored and\n\nmanipulated on a MicroVax minicomputer.\n Much of the data being compiled have been obtained through the\n\nCentre\'s research projects and are geographically referenced, and represent\n\ninformation on the geochemistry of the environment and on human and livestock\n\nhealth parameters in Jamaica.\n In order to effectively manage this data and to allow easy public\n\nsector access to the information, a Geographical Information System ( GIS) is\n\nbeing developed.\n The system uses GRASS ( i.e. Geographical Resources Analysis Support\n\nSystem) software running on a Sunsparc station 1+ as the graphical interface\n\nwith the Vax SQL database. \n\n \n\n  The Centre\'s major programmes have involved collaboration with\n\nboth international and local organisations including the British Geological\n\nSurvey ( BGS), the Geological Survey of Jamaica ( GSJ), the Natural Resource\n\n& Conservation Agency of Jamaica ( NRCA), the Scientific Research Council of\n\nJamaica ( SRC), and the Underground Water Authority ( UWA) of Jamaica. \n\n \n\n  Orientation studies for regional geochemical surveys in\n\nthe Caribbean   1,2,3  -

{'text': 'THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR SOLAR DRYING OF RED MUD\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n  ABSTRACT\n The solar drying of red mud, as is now practised at the Ewarton\n\nalumina plant of Alcan Jamaica Company, is basically a very simple process.\n The mud is spread out and allowed to dry under the hot tropical sun.\n Though simple, the process had to be neither over nor underdesigned in\n\nterms of the size of drying area necessary to treat the volume of mud\n\neffluent from the plant.\n The principles underlying the spreading and drying of the mud had\n\nto be well understood and quantified to avoid mistakes in design which could\n\nbe costly and harmful to the environment. \n\n  Of the many scientific aspects of this project, which had to be\n\nstudied, two are dealt with in some detail in this paper \x13 the rate of\n\nevaporation and the influence the rheology of the mud has on its pumping to\n\nthe drying site and its spreading thereon. \n\n \n\n  Red mud is the common name for the major waste material from\n\nalumina plants.\n It is the part of bauxite which is insoluble in the caustic soda used\n\nin alumina plants to extract the valuable part, alumina hydrate, from the\n\nbauxite. \n\n  The main constituents of red mud are the oxides of iron, silicon,\n\ntitanium, and aluminium.\n Nearly all of it is of very small particle size.\n As it comes from the alumina plant it is in the form of a slurry,\n\ni.e. the particles are suspended in water.\n The water contains a small concentration of the caustic soda used in\n\nthe plant, together with a smaller concentration of sodium carbonate and\n\nsodium aluminate.\n It is these solutes which, though only slightly toxic, are a threat\n\nto water supplies and make the handling of the waste an important part of the\n\nprocess.\n Without them, the solids in the red mud slurry would ( after drying)\n\nbe very similar in properties to the bauxite from which it came. \n\n  Extensive efforts made, worldwide, to utilize red mud as a raw\n\nmaterial for a useful product have not yet yielded a process which can absorb\n\na significant proportion of its vast output.\n Consequently, safe disposal of the major part of the red mud\n\nproduced is now, and is likely to be for some time, a major con <l>\n\nsideration in the process. \n\n  In earlier systems of red mud disposal the red mud slurry came\n\ndirect from the last stage of mud washing thickeners in the alumina plant,\n\nand consequently was a fairly fluid slurry.\n this slurry would\n\nseparate quickly into two phases \x13 the liquid phase, which was a dilute\n\nsolution of the caustic liquor circulating in the alumina plant, and a\n\nsemi-solid phase, which was a much more viscous slurry than that coming from\n\nthe plant.\n If the mud pond was sealed, the liquor phase could be recycled to the\n\nalumina plant, thereby saving the chemical content of the liquor ( sodium\n\nhydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium aluminate, and traces of other chemicals)\n\nand eliminating the chance of these chemicals contaminating the en <l>\n\nvironment \x13 particularly its water supplies.\n If the pond was not sealed, either naturally or by a manufactured\n\nseal, most of the liquor would seep into the ground and possibly contaminate\n\nwater supplies if local conditions allowed.\n The chemicals involved are not very toxic, especially when\n\nhighly diluted by rain water as they often are, but they can give the water\n\nan unpleasant taste and put it beyond the sodium concentration limits\n\nnormally regarded as acceptable for potable water supplies. \n\n  Whether or not the pond is sealed, the semi-solid phase continues\n\nto lose liquid at an ever decreasing rate over several years, and so becomes\n\nmore and more solid with time.\n In the case of Jamaican red mud ( which is very much finer in\n\nparticle size than red mud from other bauxites) the mud slurry comes from the\n\nplant at around 20% solids concentration, then quickly loses liquid until it\n\nis about 35% solids.\n Thereafter, it loses liquid slower and slower until it reaches around\n\n50% solids.\n This process is shown diagramatically in Figure 1.\n A useful study of the dynamics of these red mud ponds was carried out\n\nby Yong and Ludwig.  1    \n\n  The earlier mud disposal system suffered from loss of chemicals\n\nand risk of environmental pollution if the pond was not sealed, and\n\nsuffered from very high mud disposal cost if it was sealed ( the high cost\n\nbeing due to the cost of sealing and the frequency of having to build\n\nnew sealed ponds as each one lasted only a few years before becoming\n\ncompletely filled). \n\n  An improvement on the mud disposal system described above was the\n\nso-called  " dry stacking"  method which originated in Germany\n\nand was described by Schepers and Haerter.  2 \n reviewed the method.\n It was adopted by several alumina plants in the 1960s and 1970s.\n A similar method for other mineral tailings was first reported by\n\nRobinsky.  4,5 \n The essence of this method is that red mud slurry would be dewatered\n\n( i.e. solids concentration increased) sufficiently before leaving the\n\nalumina plant that it would not immediately separate into two phases.\n This is usually done by vacuum filtering the washed mud slurry in the\n\nplant.\n which can be pumped\n\nto mud ponds by high pressure pumps ( usually the cake has to be liquified by\n\nviolent agitation and addition of a small amount of water before it can be\n\npumped). \n\n  Besides having less liquid to lose ( and thereby reducing\n\npollution risk if the pond is not sealed), dewatering and thickening red mud\n\nslurry to the extent that high pressure pumps are needed to transport it\n\ngives it the additional advantage that it does not flow readily.\n\n\nhaving a gradient, after it comes to rest, of between 2% and 10% ( between 2\n\nand 10 units vertically to 100 units horizontally) depending on how\n\n " thick"  the mud slurry has been made.\n The advantage of this stack angle is that rain water runs\n\nreadily off the stack rather than re-wetting the mud as happens with the\n\nearlier method.\n Though it takes a long time, red mud stacks will dry out and become\n\nhard, whereas most mud ponds will never dry out. \n\n  The advantages of drying red mud as part of its scheme for\n\ndisposal make the cost and effort of doing so worthwhile.\n Dried red mud takes up much less space.\n A 75% by weight slurry occupies a little less than half the volume\n\noccupied by a 50% by weight slurry.\n Figure 2 shows the shrinkage of red mud, starting at 23% solids and\n\ndrying to zero moisture.\n\n\nfigure  \n\n \n\n  Though a stack of red mud will dry out eventually, reaching\n\ndryness can take a long time, especially if the initial water content is as\n\nhigh, as it is bound to be if the mud comes from Jamaican bauxite. (\n Jamaican red mud which is fluid enough to be pumped, has a moisture\n\ncontent of 70-75% whereas pumpable muds from other bauxites typically con <l>\n\ntain around 50% of water.\n The water content of Jamaican mud, per tonne of dry solids, can\n\ntherefore be three times that of other red muds). \n\n  Solar evaporation rate in Jamaica is high compared with most\n\nother countries where red mud is produced but the high tonnage of water to be\n\nevaporated ( around 4500 tonnes/day for each Alcan alumina plant) meant that\n\nevaporation rate had to be optimized in order to keep the land area used\n\nreasonable.\n The scientific part of the mud disposal project therefore had to do\n\nwith finding and optimizing the factors which affect the relationship\n\nbetween areas used for drying and the quantity of mud dried thereon. \n\n  This paper is concerned mainly with the scientific aspects\n\nof solar drying of red mud slurry.\n Nevertheless, in an operation carried out on a scale dictated by\n\nthe red mud output of a modern day alumina plant ( 1000-2000 tonnes/day solid\n\nbasis, 4000-10000 tonnes/day wet basis), scientific aspects could not be\n\nentirely divorced from economic considerations i.e. cost of disposal had\n\nto lie within the range affordable in relation to the market price for the\n\nend product \x13 aluminium.\n Hence elegant methods of intensification of solar radiation such\n\nas lens or mirror concentration of radiation falling on a larger area,\n\nor automatic angling of the receiving surface to keep it perpendicular to the\n\nsun\'s rays, had to be excluded.\n Likewise, double handling of the mud would have been uneconomic;\n\nconsequently, the mud had to be dried in the same location it was to remain\n\nafter drying.\n Economic factors limited the number of variables which could be\n\nmanipulated in striving towards the best solution for disposal of the red\n\nmud. \n\n  The two major scientific aspects of solar drying dealt with in\n\nthis paper are:- \n\n \n\n  b) How the rheology of the mud affects the evaporation rate via\n\nthe depth of mud layer being dried. \n\n \n\n  The solar drying of any wet, solid material involves\n\nexposing a large area of the material to direct solar radiation in order to\n\nprovide latent heat for evaporation of surface water.\n As the surface water evaporates into the surrounding air, it is\n\nreplaced by more water from the interior of the mass. \n\n  "\n\nenergy balance"  method which assumes that all radiation, less a\n\nproportion calculated to be lost by convection, conduction and re-radiation,\n\nresults in evaporation.\n\n As this method needs a lot of equipment, and more direct measurements\n\nof evaporation rate were available, it was not used in the present study.\n It was interesting, however, to check whether the magnitude of solar\n\nradiation in Jamaica was sufficient to provide the latent heat. \n\n  For mud at a concentration of 25% solids, 2.67 tonnes have to be\n\nevaporated from every tonne of solid to dry it to 75% solids.\n Consequently, to dry 1500 tonnes/day, dry basis ( the mud output of\n\nthe Ewarton plant at full production), on the 200 acres ( 80 hectares) site\n\navailable near the plant, would require an average evaporation rate of\n\n5mm/day. \n\n  If we assume an evaporation rate of 5mm/day, 5kg of water will be\n\nevaporated off each square meter.\n The latent heat needed for this evaporation would be 2850 kg.\n\ncals/day.\n This converts to 138 watts average over the 24 hours, but as most of\n\nthis comes from solar radiation, the average during 10 sunshine hours needs\n\nto be 331 watt/m  2  . \n\n  " mean net incoming\n\nradiation"  of 420 watts/m  2  at Kirkvine, reported by Wagh\n\n 7  , it appears that there is more than sufficient solar radiation\n\nto provide for 5 mm/day evaporation.\n Wagh\'s average was taken from readings taken hourly between 0730\n\nand 1730 at Battersea Pond, near Kirkvine Works, and they showed that\n\nthere is very little insolation outside these hours. \n\n  Extrapolation from the data of Langhaar ( 1953) to Jamaica\'s\n\nlatitude of 18 &degree; N gives maximum 24 hour averages ( i.e. for perfectly\n\nclear skies) of 130 BTU/(hr) ( sp.ft) in mid summer to 90 BTU in mid winter.\n over 24 hours, or\n\n984 and 687 over 10 sunshine hours.\n As these figures are for cloudless skies, and the averages due to\n\ncloud and rain are 50-60% ( say 55%) of the cloudless averages in the Eastern\n\nUnited States  8  we could expect actual monthly 10- hour averages\n\nin Jamaica to be from 540 watt/m  2  ( mid summer) to 375 watts in\n\nmid winter.\n These figures agree well with the 420 watts reported by Wagh.\n The conclusion reached is that solar radiation in Jamaica is\n\nsufficient to provide the evaporation required, providing it impinges on\n\na wet mud surface. \n\n \n\n  The alternative to Energy Balance treatment of evaporation is the\n\nmass transport approach.\n This postulates a DRIVING FORCE for evaporation and a RESISTANCE\n\nto it.\n The relationship between these two factors controls the evaporation\n\nrate.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'e7a5ad9e-e10d-42b0-8c73-c90b9cea1e17', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.365040+00:00', 'english_score': 0.962457537651062, 'non_english_score': 0.03754246234893799}

Chem.,  1951, 43(3), 628-635.  \n\n  The clarity of the chemically treated sample C was far better\n\nthan that of either the filtered or centrifuged samples A & B.\n Sample C was clear and free of sediment due to adequate flocculation\n\nand coagulation of suspended matter on treatment with lime and flocculant at\n\nan elevated temperature ( 95 &degree; C).\n Sample A and B however, were cloudy and contained a significant\n\namount of suspended material.\n Though the colour of the centrifuged juice improved on filtration,\n\nsamples A and B were inferior in quality to sample C ( Table 1). \n\n \n\n \n\n  Four samples of sorghum juice of brix density 15.0 &degree; Bx\n\nwere conventionally clarified ( as described for sample C) at pH ( i) 7.5 (\n\nii) 8.0 ( iii) 8.5 and ( iv) 9.0.\n The colour of the clarified juices was monitored and sugar analyses\n\nwere carried out.\n Table 2 shows that destruction of sugars increased with increasing\n\npH.\n Both the percentage sucrose and reducing sugars decreased as the\n\npH increased from 7.5 to 9.0.\n There was no direct relationship between juice colour and pH.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  The effect of temperature on juice clarity was investigated at pH\n\n8.5.\n Three samples of sorghum juice of 15.0 &degree; Bx were limed to pH\n\n8.5 and treated with 5 ppm flocculant.\n One of these samples was heated to 75 &degree; C, another to 85\n\n&degree; C and the third to 95 &degree; C, and these were held at their\n\nrespective temperatures for two hours.\n The juices were then filtered and the colour of the clarified\n\njuice determined. \n\n  Juice clarity increased with temperature ( Table 3).\n At 75 &degree; C, juice colour was poor and the clarified juice was\n\ncloudy.\n At 85 &degree; C, the resulting clarified juice contained only\n\nscattered fine flocs and at 95 &degree; C, the sample was free of particulate\n\nmatter.\n Complete coagulation of suspended juice material had occurred at\n\n95 &degree; C but poor settling of the coagulated flocs was evident.\n Cooling this juice to about 60 &degree; C, however, resulted in ready\n\nsettling.\n \'cold\n\nclarification\'  was investigated as a possible method of\n\nprocessing sorghum juice. \n\n  Destruction of sugars intensified with increasing temperature.\n At 75 &degree; C the clarified juice contained 10.3% total sugars and\n\nat 95 &degree; C the sugar content was 9.85%. \n\n  of Sorghum Juice\n\n  \n\n  Three samples of sorghum juice were first screened through mesh\n\n# 120 to remove coarse particles and the pH of each sample adjusted\n\nto ( i) 7.5 ( ii) 8.0 and ( iii) 8.5 with milk of lime.\n\n\nperature of 55 &degree; C for one hour.\n The juices were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 minutes and the\n\nsupernatant decanted.\n The colour of the juices was then determined and the samples compared\n\nwith those obtained from conventional clarification at 95 &degree; C.\n For each set of conditions, the juice of optimum clarity was\n\nselected for concentration to syrup.\n The colour of the final syrup was then determined by measuring the\n\nabsorbance of a 2% w/v aqueous solution of the syrup at 560 nm ( Table 4).\n\n  \n\n  Juices obtained from clarification at 95 &degree; C were superior\n\nto those produced at 55 &degree; C.\n On the other hand, settling of coarser juice particles occurred more\n\nreadily at 55 &degree; C but coagulation of the suspended plant material\n\nwas poor at this temperature and the  \'clarified\'  juices\n\nremained cloudy. \n\n  The colour of syrup prepared at pH 8.5 and 95 &degree; C fell\n\nwithin the range of the commercial standards whereas the colour of syrup\n\nproduced by the cold clarification technique fell just outside this range (\n\nTable 5).\n It is interesting to note however, that neither of the commercial\n\nstandards falls within the targeted range.\n Importantly, at 95 &degree; C, the syrup produced was free of\n\nsediment matter.\n On concentration of the clarified juice obtained at 55 &degree;\n\nC, further coagulation of suspended material occurred and the resulting syrup\n\ncontained scattered flocs.\n This is a highly undesirable condition and emphasizes the\n\nsignificance of hot clarification in the production of sorghum syrup  . \n " Agricultural\n\nHandbook # 441"  , USDA.

{'text': "STOCHASTIC SIMULATION AND FORECASTING OF HOURLY AVERAGE WIND\n\nSPEED SEQUENCES IN JAMAICA  \n\n \n\n\n  Department of Physics, University of the West Indies, Kingston 7,\n\nJamaica \n\n  -\n Stochastic simulation and forecast models of hourly average speeds are\n\npresented in this paper.\n The models take into account several basic features of wind speed data\n\nincluding autocorrelation, non-Gaussian distribution, and diurnal\n\nnonstationarity.\n The positive correlation between consecutive wind speed observations\n\nis taken into account by fitting an autoregressive moving average ( ARMA)\n\nprocess to wind speed data which were transformed to make their distribution\n\napproximately Gaussian and standardized to remove diurnal nonstationarity.\n Based on three years of data, separate models were obtained for the\n\nmonths of June, July, and August.\n Tests were performed to verify the adequacy of the models and\n\ncomparisons were made between generated and real series and between\n\nforecasted and real series to check if the wind speed behaviour was\n\nfaithfully reproduced.\n\n\n \n\n  The peak demand for power in Jamaica during any typical day\n\noccurs in the early afternoon ( private communication, Jamaica Public\n\nService Co. Ltd.).\n\n\nternoon, it is possible that wind energy conversion systems ( WECS)\n\ncould be used as alternate back-up supplies instead of conventional\n\nback-up plants if the winds are favourable.\n These conventional plants require approximately a 15-minute\n\nstart-up time; and if WECS are to be used as alternate sources of back-up\n\npower to the national grid, a statistical model is necessary to forecast wind\n\npower in advance.\n Such a forecast would allow a load dispatcher at the Public Utility\n\nto determine how much back-up power could be expected from WECS a few\n\nhours in advance and advise accordingly.\n Since wind power is a function of wind speed, forecasts of power\n\ngenerally are derived from forecasts of speed.\n Methods of converting wind speed to wind power are described\n\nextensively in the literature ( e.g. [ 1] and [ 2]) and will not be discussed\n\nhere. \n\n  Models to forecast wind speeds were developed by using data from\n\nNorman Manley International Airport, which is situated in the vicinity of\n\nKingston.\n Data from this site were chosen because of their reliability and\n\ncontinuity and also because a previous study [ 3] indicated that the\n\narea in the vicinity of Manley was a good site for WECS.\n The models were also used to simulate winds speeds at Manley since a\n\nmethodology to develop reliable models to simulate wind speeds is required as\n\nthe data at the other potential WECS sites are of short duration ( e.g.;\n\nFlagaman, Discovery Bay, and Pimento Hill) and a long sequence of data is nec\n\n<l> essary in reliability and load matching studies. \n\n  Many previous studies such as those by Chou and Corotis [ 4], Goh\n\nand Nathan [ 5], McNerney and Veers [ 6], and Kirchhoff  et al.  [\n\n7] have attempted to incorporate autocorrelation into wind speed models.\n The approaches taken in some of these studies have been based on very\n\nspecific assumptions about the statistical characteristics of wind speed\n\ndata.\n\n\ntant properties of such data, including the non-Gaussian shape and\n\nnonstationarity of the wind speed.\n The Chou and Corotis model has been found not to generate enough\n\npersistency in simulated data [ 8].\n The work of McNerney and Veers used a Markov method for simulating\n\nnon-Gaussian wind speed time series, with a Rayleigh distribution as an\n\nexample.\n employed a Markov chain model\n\nfor generating time series for 15-minute average wind speeds and for rapidly\n\nsampled turbulent wind speeds. \n\n \n\n[ 9] and Brown  et al.  [ 2] employed a class of parametric\n\ntime series models called autoregressive moving average processes ( ARMA)\n\nmade popular by Box and Jenkins [ 10].\n However, the previous studies did not use several years of wind speed\n\ndata for a given month to develop a model for that month.\n If more than one year of data for a given month is used, the\n\nstatistical calculations would be more complicated, requiring a revision of\n\nthe formulae.\n The primary advantage of including more than one year of data in the\n\nmodel development is the increased reliability of the estimates of the model\n\nparameter.\n In particular, a wind speed model based on many years of June data\n\nshould be more representative of future June speeds than a model based on a\n\nsingle year of June data. \n\n  The modelling methodology described here, consists of first\n\nfitting ARMA process of various orders to hourly average wind speed ( HAWS)\n\ndata which have been transformed to make their distribution approximately\n\nGaussian and standardized to remove diurnal nonstationarity.\n Then a model selection criterion is employed to select the most\n\nappropriate ARMA process.\n Seasonal nonstationarity is removed by fitting a separate model for\n\neach month.   \n\n \n\n\n\n  Transformation to obtain a Gaussian distribution\n\n  \n\n  By applying the graphical method of cumulative probability\n\ndistribution used by Tackle and Brown [ 11] it was found that the hourly\n\naverage wind speeds ( HAWS) at Norman Manley International Airport could be\n\ndescribed by a Weibull distribution of shape factor between 2 and 3.\n that the distribution\n\nwas positively skewed.\n Similar skewed distributions have been found to characterize wind\n\nspeeds measured at other sites and over other time periods. \n\n  Time series models based on Markov chain models have been\n\ndeveloped for random variables possessing a Weibull distribution [ 6,7].\n [ 2] took an alternative approach to\n\napproximating the fitting of a Weibull distribution by applying a power\n\ntransformation.\n Dubey [ 12] showed that for a shape factor close to 3.6, the Weibull\n\ndistribution is similar to a Gaussian distribution.\n Use of this result provided one method of selecting an appropriate\n\npower transformation to make the distribution approximately Gaussian.\n This approach is reasonable because a Weibull random variable raised\n\nto a power  m  is also a Weibull random variable. \n\n  has a Weibull probability density\n\nfunction  where  k  and  c  are the shape\n\nand scale parameters, respectively, then  U  m   has a\n\nWeibull distribution with shape parameter  k/m  and scale parameter\n\n c  m   .\n to find an appropriate power\n\n m  for the transformation, it is only necessary to solve the\n\nequation  \n\n  can be determined by\n\nthe graphical method of Tackle and Brown [ 11].\n\n\nc  and  k  is the maximum likelihood technique given by Johnson\n\nand Kotz [ 13].\n , respectively, satisfy\n\neqns ( 3) and ( 4) below.\n Equations ( 3) and ( 4) are slightly revised to accommodate more than\n\none year of data for a given month.   \n\n where  U  n,y   = hourly average wind speed for the\n\n y  - th year;  y  = 1, 2, 3 &  Y  ( the number of\n\nyears of observation);  n  = 1, 2, 3 &  N  ( the\n\nnumber of observations of a given month of a year). \n\n  is obtained from eqn ( 4), and then\n\nused in eqn ( 3), to find the value of  c  .\n Equation ( 4), however, is a transcendental equation that requires an\n\niterative process to achieve a solution.\n .\n This value is then put into the right-hand side of the eqn ( 4), and\n\na second value of  k  is obtained.\n In about 3 to 10 iterations, convergence to within 0.01% should be\n\nachieved, depending on the difference between the first guess and the final\n\nvalue of  k  .\n into eqn ( 3), the value\n\nof  c  could be determined. \n\n  Another approach to selecting a power transformation to\n\nobtain an approximately Gaussian distribution is by using the skewness\n\nstatistic [ 14]  where  M  n,y   ( assumed\n\ntransformed data) = (  U  n,y   )   m   ;\n\n&unch; = mean of the  M  n,y   series;  s  =\n\nstandard deviation of the series.     \n\n  The skewness statistic method requires the transformation of\n\nthe data using several values of  m  ( e.g., 1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7).\n Then the skewness statistic, which is a measure of the symmetry of a\n\ndistribution, is calculated for each set of transformed data.\n It takes a value of zero when the distribution is completely\n\nsymmetric.\n k\n\n  , the value of  m  for which  S  k  \n\nis closest to zero can be determined approximately. \n\n \n\nformation is applied to adjust for the non-Gaussian distribution of HAWS\n\ngiving transformed data:  \n\n  Standardization to remove diurnal nonstationarity\n\n  \n\n  The diurnal nonstationarity can be removed by subtracting the\n\nhourly expected values &mu; (  t  ) from the     transformed data and by\n\ndividing by the hourly standard deviation.\n Thus the transformed, standardized hourly average wind speed is given\n\nby  where   \n\n \n\nt  ) are periodic functions, for example   ,   , \n\n  )\n\nmay be estimated by the sample mean and the standard deviation of all the\n\ntransformed wind speed in the  t  - th hour of the day.   \n\n \n\n \n\n  ARMA models incorporate into prediction not only past values of\n\nthe data but past values of the prediction residuals as well.\n ) model can be written as\n\nfollows:  \n\n \n\nformula  = autoregressive parameters;  = moving average\n\nparameters;  a  n,y   = white noise process ( uncorrelated\n\nrandom variables with mean 0 and variance  ) .\n It is obvious that the moving average parameters will be equal to\n\nzero if the model is a pure autoregressive ( AR) process. \n\n  The model building process comprises three main steps: ( i)\n\nidentification, ( ii) estimation, and ( iii) diagnostic checking.\n The identification and estimation steps necessarily overlap.\n The first step consists of selecting a model which seems to be a\n\ngood representation of the data.\n In the second step, the chosen model is fitted accurately to the data\n\nand the model parameters are evaluated.\n Diagnostic checking, the last step, tests the validity of the model.\n If it is judged inadequate by established tests, the three steps must\n\nbe repeated until a suitable model is obtained. \n\n \n\n  The identification step consists of the preliminary estimation of\n\nthe model parameters and the determination of the values of  p \n\nand  q  in the eqn ( 10).\n ) are ob\n\n<l> tained by replacing the theoretical autocorrelations by the estimated\n\nautocorrelation  r  k   in the Yule-Walker \n\n equations ( Box and Jenkins [ 10], p. 82).\n is\n\nestimated using the equation  where   and  c  k   is the unbiassed estimate of the\n\npopulation auto  -  covariance of lag  k  = 1, 2, 3 & .\n The above-mentioned method can be used to obtain initial estimates of\n\n for and AR (  p  ) model or the AR component of the\n\nARMA (  p  ,  q  ) model. \n\n  The white noise variance of a pure autoregressive model is\n\nestimated from the equation  where  is the\n\nvariance of the transformed standardized HAWS.   \n\n \n\np  ,  q  ) model is obtained from the series \n\nby calculating the autocovariance function  of the  series.\n can be calculated as usual by eqn ( 12).\n\n\nformula  in terms of the  c  k   of the  series and the &unch;'s already available from the previous steps.\n and\n\nthe residual variance  are obtained by solving equation\n\nA6.2.4 of Box and Jenkins [ 10] iteratively by assuming the initial values of\n\nthe unknown parameters to be zero. \n\n \n\n  The general appearance of plots of the estimated autocorrelation\n\nfunction ( ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function ( PACF) of the\n\ntransformed, standardized    wind speed series versus lag  k  is studied to provide clues\n\nabout the choice of the order of  p  and  q  for ARMA\n\nparameters.\n The characteristic behaviour of the theoretical ACF of an AR process\n\nof order  p  tails off while the theoretical PACF has a cut-off\n\nvalue after lag  p  .\n ) ) are\n\nobtained from Durbins relations [ 10].\n If both the ACF and PACF tail off, a mixed process is suggested.\n -\n\nth order AR component and a  q  - th order moving average compo <l>\n\nnent, is a mixture of exponentials and damped sine waves after the first \n\nq-p  lags.\n Conversely, the PACF for a mixed process is dominated by a mixture of\n\nexponentials and damped sine waves after the first  p-q  lags [\n\n10]. \n\n  Another qualitative procedure for choosing the order of an\n\nARMA process is called the Bayesian information criterion ( BIC).\n It is a mathematical formulation which considers the principle\n\nof parsimony in model building.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '583c12a5-c44f-4f09-9bd1-cc79cf17a4dc', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.368002+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9401640295982361, 'non_english_score': 0.059835970401763916}

[ 18].\n type\n\nof factory \x13 the world market factory ( WMF) which can be located within or\n\noutside of a zone \x13 produces goods and services geared for the world market.\n The WMF concept

of similar enterprises spread around the globe. \n\n\n\n  The paper will examine the performance of EOI and EPZ investments\n\nin Jamaica in terms of export growth, employment and income generation,\n\nforeign exchange earnings, local value-added, technology transfer, the train\n\n<l> ing of personnel, and in general, the promotion of industrial\n\ndevelopment.\n The objective here is to go beyond the sterility of cost-benefit\n\nanalyses and give some perspective on the developmental impact of the EOI\n\nstrategy on the viability of local firms and the working and living\n\nconditions of the people involved.\n The paper begins with some reflection on the global experience\n\nof EOI/EPZ investments, then concludes with an assessment of the\n\ndevelopmental prospects for the export-oriented clothing industry in the\n\nCaribbean in the context of the changing international political economy.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Jamaica provides an interesting case study because during the\n\n1980s the neo-liberal model of structural adjustment was embraced, first, by\n\nSeaga, as an economic and foreign policy strategy, then, continued by Manley\n\nafter the 1989 elections for lack of a political and economic alternative [\n\nHuber and Stephens, 29].\n The strategy gained strong financial and intellectual support from\n\nthe Bretton Woods institutions and the U.S. administration, especially in the\n\nearly 1980s under the Reagan administration. \n\n\n In the period 1980 to 1988, Jamaica received US$1,035 million from\n\nthe United States, making it one of the five largest aid beneficiaries per\n\ncapita [ See Huber and Stephens 29, p. 68]. \n The promotion of EOI was one of the major planks of this strategy.\n EPZs and WMFs were established and they eventually made a real\n\nimpact on the domestic economy, especially in terms of employment generation\n\n( mostly young women) and the growth of non-traditional exports ( mostly\n\nclothing). \n\n  The export-oriented clothing industry is the dominant sector in\n\nJamaica\'s  " new"  export thrust. \n\n\n There are four EPZs in Jamaica, but only three were operational in\n\nDecember 1990.\n Of the operational zones the Kingston Free Zone is the largest \x13 peak\n\nemployment of 11,000 in 1987.\n The main activity is apparel manufacturing.\n The same applies to the Garmex Free Zone.\n The Montego Free Zone has some apparel manufacturing and houses a\n\nDigiport system which facilitates information processing.\n There is also some export-oriented activity ( apparel and electronic\n\nassembly) in WMFs outside of the EPZs. \n It is also the most transnationalized industry, and, despite the\n\ntrend towards redeployment to the industrialized countries [ Junne 33], firms\n\ncontinue to migrate to low wage areas, especially for labour-intensive,\n\nassembly stage production [ Hoffman 27, Mody and Wheeler 45, Mytelka 46].\n Exemplifying this trend is the locational shift of U.S. and Asian\n\nclothing manufacturers into the region, since the early 1980s, to exploit the\n\nlow levels of coverage of Caribbean countries under the Multi-Fibre\n\nArrangement ( MFA), their relative ease of access to the U.S. market through\n\nre-import schemes like the Caribbean Basin Initiative ( CBI)  " super\n\n807",   their cheap labour, and their\n\ngeographic proximity to the U.S. [ Steele 55]. \n is a preferential trading programme\n\nintroduced in 1986 that applies to only CBI-eligible countries with whom the\n\nU.S. has negotiated bilateral agreements.\n It guarantees access for clothing assembled in the Caribbean without\n\nregard to quota levels providing the clothing is made entirely from U.S.\n\nmaterials [ See Steele 55].  \n\n  The study of the export-oriented clothing industry in Jamaica is\n\nalso timely because of the establishment of the North American Free Trade\n\nAgreement ( NAFTA) between the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n NAFTA is essentially an economic strategy to enhance the\n\ncompetitiveness and market share of U.S. firms in the Americas in response to\n\nthe high level of import penetration from Japan, Europe and Asia during the\n\n1980s.\n It is envisioned that NAFTA will erode the preferential market access\n\nthat Caribbean and Central American countries enjoy under CBI.\n The argument being put forward suggests that the trade access\n\nadvantage that NAFTA gives to Mexico will result in some trade and investment\n\ndiversion from the Caribbean Basin.  \n This sentiment was expressed in a communique at the 17th annual Miami\n\nConference on the Caribbean.\n The conference was sponsored by Caribbean/Latin American Action, a\n\nWashington-based, non-profit advocacy organization for private\n\nsector-oriented development [  Caribbean Week  8, p. 85].\n\n \n\n  These impulses in the world economy behove us to assess the\n\nexport competitiveness and the developmental efficacy of the new mode of\n\nspecialization that Jamaica and other developing countries have embarked\n\nupon.\n When placed against the backdrop of declining traditional exports,\n\nintractable unemployment, chronic indebtedness and persistent poverty,\n\nthese trends take on even greater significance.\n The case study also has theoretical importance in that it\n\nquestions the relevance of the neo- liberal model for peripheral capitalist\n\neconomies. \n\n \n\n  Since the early 1970s, with the onset of the world-wide economic\n\ncrisis, many developing countries have experienced worsening economic\n\nconditions ( e.g. declining earnings in commodity exports, balance of\n\npayments crises, debt overhang, chronic unemployment).\n As a response, many countries have opted to promote EOI, inviting the\n\nestablishment of EPZs and WMFs.\n This strategy has enjoyed much favour in international development\n\npolicy and praxis, especially among the multilateral financial agencies and\n\nhas become the major policy prescription in the structural adjustment\n\npackage. \n\n  The confidence in this strategy is derived largely from the\n\n " success stories"  of the newly industrializing\n\ncountries ( NICs) of East Asia, particularly when compared with the\n\nperformance of the industrially advanced Latin American countries in terms of\n\ngrowth rates, non-traditional exports, and manufacturing employment.\n The Asian success, it is argued, proves that the developmental gains\n\npossible from EOI are superior to the previously favoured strategy of\n\nimport-substitution industrialization ( ISI) [ Balassa 2, Krueger 37,\n\nHarberger 25, Lin 41, Fishlow 16].\n These authors also argue that the success of the Asian NICs is\n\nattributable to  " getting prices right"  through liberalizing\n\ntheir economies and reducing the role of the state. \n\n  orthodoxy of EOI has not gone\n\nunchallenged, however.\n Several critiques have emerged that question not only the\n\nuniversality of the EOI prescriptions for developing countries [ Cline10,\n\nGriffith 22, Hamilton 24, Broad and Cavanagh 6], but also the validity of the\n\northodoxy\'s interpretation of East Asian history and their conception of\n\nthe Asian NICs as free trade, laissez-faire economies [ Cummings 13,\n\nLuedde-Neurath 43, Bienefeld 4, Jenkins 32].\n\n\nsons Latin America can learn from the East Asian experience concludes that:\n\n \n\n  Attempts to impose neoclassical orthodoxy on the Latin\n\nAmerican countries, in the guise of learning from the East Asian NICs, will\n\ndo nothing to resolve the fundamental economic problems of the\n\nre<l>gion&dotted-line;\n Many of the policies currently in vogue in Latin America are based\n\non a misreading of the experience of the East Asian NICs [ p.\n\n51].\n\n  Additionally, there are those authors that argue that EOI should\n\nbe considered as a new mode of peripheral specialization rather than as\n\na development strategy.\n Their argument is based on the view that EOI is the outcome of the\n\nrelocation strategy of transnational capital and thus is part and parcel of\n\nthe current transformation in the New International Division of Labour (\n\nNIDL) and not the result of individual country strategy [ Adam 1, Landsberg\n\n40, Frobel et al. 18].\n This argument is substantiated by studies on the ownership and\n\ncontrol patterns of export-oriented production within the NICs.\n These studies report a significant presence of transnational capital\n\nthrough equity participation [ Nayyar 47, Lall 39], international\n\nsubcontracting [ Sharpston 52, Grunwald and Flamm 23], marketing arrangements\n\n[ UNCTAD 59], and the commercialization of technology [ Oman 48].\n These transactions accommodate highly centralized decision-making,\n\ntransfer pricing, and other non-price arrangements that by-pass the\n\nmarket completely and thus bring into question the fundamental tenets of\n\ntraditional international trade theory [ Helleiner 26].\n W.W. Blumenthal [ 5], the former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury,\n\nmakes a similar argument in the following statement:  \n\n  The enhanced interdependence in world trade is changing\n\nin im<l>portant ways such that the production of parts, components,\n\nsub<l>systems, products and services are intermingled and exchanged in ways\n\nthat render debates as to the final product\'s national origin not much to the\n\npoint [ p. 537].\n\n  Despite the utility of these critiques, there continues to be\n\noverwhelming acceptance and confidence in the orthodoxy\'s thesis in\n\ndevelopment circles.\n This fact is exemplified by the growth of EPZs in developing\n\ncountries.\n In 1970, there were some 20 operational or near-operational EPZs in\n\n10 developing countries.\n By 1986, the total number of EPZs rose to 175, with 85 under\n\nconstruction and another 25 in the planning stage.\n This means that by the early 1990s half of all the countries\n\nclassified as  " developing"  by the U.N. will be active in\n\nthe business of operating close to 300 EPZs [ ILO 30, p. 2-3] \n\n  In the Caribbean and Central American region ( excluding the\n\nMexican Border Zones), the growth of export-oriented activity has been\n\nequally spectacular.\n In 1975, there were 5 zones employing 15000 persons.\n By 1987, the number of zones had climbed to 30, with over 180,000\n\npersons employed.\n In that same period industrial factory space has grown tremendously,\n\nexpanding from 2 million square feet to approximately 17 million square\n\nfeet.\n The supply of factory space is forecasted to double by 1992 [ The\n\nServices Group 51]. \n\n  This outward expansion in the supply of EPZs, in light of the\n\ncurrent phase of downturn  in the world economy and\n\ntransformations in the international division of labour ( i.e. slow\n\neconomic growth and demand, techno-economic change, structural and\n\ntechnological unemployment, neo-protectionism, and the\n\ntransnationalization of production), has had the effect of heightening\n\ncompetition and rivalry among countries and firms in the search for markets.\n\n\n The term " " downturn" " is utilized to\n\ncharacterize the current phase of crisis and restructuring in the capitalist\n\nworld-economy.\n It refers to the end of the post-war boom ( the biggest boom in the\n\nhistory of capitalism) and the beginning of a phase of noticeably reduced\n\nworld economic growth with the simultaneous transformation of a number of\n\nstructural features of the capitalist world-economy [ Frobel 19].\n For an analysis of the significance of cyclical shifts ( long-waves\n\nor Kondratieff cycles) in the world economy see Hopkins and Wallerstein [\n\n28], Freeman and Perez [ 17] and Perez [ 49]. \n One of the important consequences of this trend, for developing\n\ncountries in particular, is that labour-power and production sites have be\n\n<l> come highly competitive internationally-traded commodities [ Frobel 19].\n This has resulted in a scenario where developing countries outbid\n\neach other, drive down the price of production sites and labour, and so\n\neffectively subsidize the cost of relocation for transnational capital [\n\nKreye et al. 38].\n These observations seem to signal the maturity of the EOI/EPZ\n\nphenomenon as well as the limited developmental potential of EOI investments\n\nfor developing countries. \n\n  Despite the high level of optimism that has accompanied the\n\nEOI/EPZ phenomenon, the experience globally suggests that the developmental\n\ncontribution, in terms of linkages, local value-added, foreign exchange\n\nearnings and technological multiplier effects, has been disappointing.\n For instance, an OECD study in 1981 was only able to identify seven\n\nzones that were successful out of a total of 96 zones that were in\n\noperation [ Sklair 53].\n Two of the zones listed as successful in the OECD study were the Iri\n\nand Masan zones in South Korea.\n\n\nclude that EPZs should be seen only as a mechanism for the creation of\n\nadditional employment opportunities and the generation of a certain amount of\n\nnet foreign exchange earnings.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd4bdc51c-a182-47b1-b6ad-39cdbd779122', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.369380+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9334507584571838, 'non_english_score': 0.06654924154281616}

[ 1] and U.S.P. [ 2] assays for\n\nsalbutamol ( as the sulfate) in formulation are based on HPLC and non-aqueous\n\ntitration, and are described specifically for tablets, injection solutions\n\nand aerosol sprays.\n Although the non-aqueous titration method is straightforward, it is\n\ninapplicable to syrups and solutions, while the other methods are unsuitable\n\nfor the technologically less well-developed settings in which it is often\n\nnecessary to quantify salbutamol in formulations.\n An earlier B.P. method [ 3] is based on anion-exchange chromatography\n\nand the UV absorption at 276 nm of the salbutamol cation in acid.\n Although suitable to relatively low-technology environments and, in\n\nprinciple, applicable to a number of formulations, this method is\n\ndescribed specifically for tablets only; it is subject to interference from\n\nneutral and cationic excipients, and additives, several of which absorb in\n\nthe same mid-UV region as salbutamol. \n\n  Recently published salbutamol assays include a\n\nmicrotitrimetric method [ 4], described in application for tablets only, and\n\na number of others which entail the formation of highly unstable derivatives\n\nwith various chromogenic agents [ 5-16].   \n\n  The phenolic group in salbutamol makes it a reductant for the\n\nFolin-    Ciocalteau   reagent, a chromogenic\n\nagent which has been widely applied to the determination of a number of\n\ncompounds with reducing properties [ 17], and has been successfully used to\n\nquantify phenol morphine in the presence of its methyl ether codeine [ 18].\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  A Phillips single beam P48670 visible/near-IR spectrophotometer\n\nwas used for the absorbance measurements at 760 nm.\n For the B.P. method [ 3] and the measurement of spectra of\n\nneutral solutions obtained by ion-exchange chromatography of syrups, UV\n\nabsorbances were determined on a Hewlett-Packard 8452 diode array\n\nspectrophotometer.\n A 1 cm quartz cell was used in both cases.\n\n\n \n\n  Pure drug samples were obtained from P.A.

( 1992), a modification of the method of Rowsell et al. ( 1972) and\n\nWanders et al. ( 1990).\n Under the assay conditions, it is estimated that for human liver,\n\n L  - glutamate: glyoxylate amino transferase ( GGT,\n\n EC 2.6.1.4  ) is responsible for 5-10 per cent of the pyruvate\n\nformed ( Thompson and Richardson, 1966).\n The activity of GGT was measured by substituting glutamate for\n\nalanine in the assay medium.\n The true AGT activity was calculated as the total activity minus the\n\nactivity attributed to GGT.\n Protein concentration was determined using the bi-cinchonic acid\n\nmodification of the Lowry assay for protein ( Smith et al., 1985). \n\n \n\n\n\n  The weight of the three human placentae was 640, 547 and 679 g,\n\nand the birthweight of the infants was 2830, 3770 and 4010 g, respectively.\n For the human placenta and for the rat placenta, no measurable\n\nactivity was detected, for either AGT or GGT ( Table 1).\n To validate that the method was in fact capable of measuring activity\n\nif present, the assays were carried out in rat liver.\n Table 1 shows that for rats at 20 days gestation, the mean AGT\n\nactivity in liver was 10.5 &mu; mol pyruvate/h/mg protein.\n\n\nacetate/h/mg protein.\n The GGT activity was measured in an initial experiment, but not in\n\nsubsequent assays. \n\n \n\n  Glycine is required in large amounts for normal growth ( Jackson,\n\n1991).\n Although the fetal liver may make some contribution ( Moores et al.,\n\n1994), delivery of adequate amounts from the placenta is considered to be the\n\nmost important source for normal fetal development.\n In the human, placental uptake of glycine from the maternal\n\ncirculation contributes less than 10 per cent to the flow of glycine in the\n\numbilical vein and the transporter systems for glycine are much less active\n\nthan those for leucine, for example ( Cetin et al., 1995); rather, serine is\n\ntaken up by the placenta from the maternal circulation in relatively large\n\namounts, and most of this is released into the umbilical vein as glycine (\n\nGeddie et al., 1996).\n Based on this evidence it has been concluded that the placental\n\nformation of glycine from serine, derived either from the maternal\n\ncirculation or the fetal liver itself, is the major source of glycine for the\n\nfetus ( Meschia, 1997).\n In the present study we have shown that the alternative pathway for\n\nglycine formation by transamination does not take place in either the rat\n\nplacenta at 20 days gestation or the term human placenta.\n From this we conclude that the formation of glycine from serine\n\nthrough the pathway catalysed by SHMT is the most important, if not only,\n\npathway for glycine formation in the placenta ( Neuberger, 1981). \n\n \n\ntal folate deficiency reduces the interconversion of serine and glycine by 50\n\nper cent ( Arnstein and Stankovic, 1956).\n Therefore, it can be presumed that if maternal folate status is\n\nmarginal or inadequate the placental synthesis of glycine will be\n\nconstrained.\n Periconceptual folate status has been associated with neural tube\n\ndefects ( MRC Vitamin Study Research Group, 1991) and is linked directly with\n\nfetal development ( Shojania, 1984).\n Poor folate status during pregnancy has been associated with an\n\nincreased prevalence of low birth weight babies ( Baumslag, Edelstein and\n\nMetz, 1970, Shojania, 1984, Tamura et al., 1992).\n In infants with intrauterine growth retardation, the activity of the\n\nplacental system A transporter, which carries glycine and serine, is reduced\n\nso that both direct glycine transfer, and the glycine endogenously produced\n\nfrom serine are reduced ( Dicke et al., 1993; Mahendran et al., 1993). \n\n  L\n\n - oxoproline as a marker for glycine status.\n In pregnancies where glycine status is poorer, the offspring tend to\n\nbe smaller ( Jackson et al., 1997d).\n It appears that mothers with poor folate status tend to have children\n\nwith poor glycine status ( Jackson et al., 1997a).\n As glycine status is itself related to vascular development ( Sherman\n\net al., 1998), and has been associated directly with the development of\n\nmaturity onset diabetes mellitus ( Jackson et al., 1997b), the possibility\n\nemerges that the ability to form adequate amounts of glycine is programmed in\n\nutero in relation to maternal glycine status at the time.\n If this were to be so then the factors which determine the ability of\n\nthe placenta to provide adequate amounts of glycine to the fetus need to be\n\nexplored in much greater detail.  \n\n\n\n \n\nBontia Daphnoides L.    \n\n \n\n \n\n  and Zoology\n\n 2  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n Activity guided isolation of the crude ethanol extract of the leaves\n\nand stems of  Bontia   daphnoides  using adult  Cylas\n\n  formicarius  as the test organism revealed that the most\n\ninsecticidally active compound was the sesquiterpene furan, epingaione.\n This compound was previously isolated and characterized by Chinnock\n\n et   al.  , ( 1987).\n values ( &mu; g/insect) found for the\n\nfuran was 20.80 ( 17.34 \x13 24.52), while the values obtained for a nicotine\n\nrich extract of tobacco and a commercial organophosphate insecticide,\n\ndimethoate were 32.00 ( 28.15 \x13 40.32) and 9.54 ( 8.40 \x13 10.62) &mu;\n\ng/insect, respectively.  \n\n \n\n  The long term use and misuse of conventional synthetic\n\ninsecticides ( organochlorines, organophosphates and carbamates) has created\n\nmany ecological and environmental problems ( Brown, 1978; Flickinger  et\n\nal.  , 1986; Stromborg, 1986).\n Chief among these problems include: induction of resistance in\n\nseveral pest species ( Georghiou and Melon, 1982), toxicity to non-target\n\norganisms including man and the natural enemies of various pest species (\n\nReid, 1987; Georghiou and Melon, 1982), contamination of several water bodies\n\n( National Research Council of Canada, 1975; Williams and Chow, 1993) and\n\nhigh levels of residues in agricultural food products ( Thomson and Abbott,\n\n1967; Vettorazzi and Miles-Vettorazzi, 1975; Flickinger  et al.  ,\n\n1986).\n Thus, there is an urgent need to find safer pesticides for use in\n\npresent day pest management programmes.\n One source of these safer pesticides is the secondary metabolites (\n\nnatural products) isolated from plants ( Williams, et al., 1989).\n These compounds have demonstrated a diverse array of biological\n\nactions on arthropod species which include disruption cytochrome P450\n\nactivities by monoterpenes ( Brattsten, 1982); retardation of corpora allata\n\ndevelopment by the precocenes ( Bowers, 1982) and inhibition of\n\nneuroendocrine processes, protein and lipid metabolisms by several limonoids\n\ne.g. the azadirachtins ( Rembold  et al.  , 1984; Sieber,  et\n\nal.  , 1984; Bidmon  et al.  , 1987; Dorn  et al.  ,\n\n1987; Wilps,  et al.  , 1992). \n\n  Williams ( 1992) demonstrated that extracts from the leaves and\n\nstems of  Bontia daphnoides  were effective in killing \n\nTribolium confusum  .\n These findings were confirmed in a later study by Williams and\n\nMansingh ( 1993).\n However, the major insecticidally active compound ( s) was not\n\nelucidated from the extract.\n Thus, in the present study an attempt was made in isolating and\n\nelucidating the active compound. \n\n \n\n\n\n  Preparation of crude extracts and fraction from B.\n\ndaphnoides   \n\n  were air dried in\n\nthe laboratory for 5 days.\n Dried plant material weighing 400 g was then pulverized and extracted\n\nwith 8.0 L of 95 % ethanol for 120 hrs.\n\n\nto 20 mL using a rotary evaporator.\n To the concentrated crude extract 200 mL of hexane and 200 mL of a\n\nmethanol-water ( 10: 1;

( in review\n\nb). \n\n  N levels in coral tissue reflect that in their\n\nsources of nitrogen, coral have the potential ability to trace isotopically\n\nenriched nitrogen near sources of terrestrial input.\n N values,\n\nbecause  15  N values are dependant on light as well as on exogenous\n\n 15  N levels ( Muscatine and Kaplan 1994, Heikoop et al. in review\n\na). \n\n  Studies by Risk et al. ( 1989, 1994) have indicated the potential\n\nof  15  N in coral tissue to trace terrestrial sources of nitrogen,\n\nwhile recent unpublished studies from Indonesia ( Dunn 1995, Jompa 1996,\n\nLimmon 1996) have shown trends in  15  N in coral tissue with\n\npollution gradients. \n\n  This paper seeks to determine if coral tissues are enriched in\n\n 15  N according to their position along a known pollution gradient\n\nin Jamaica. \n\n \n\n \n\n  Four coral communities were selected along the pollution gradient\n\n( Figure 1), characterised by a progressive increase in water transparency\n\nand a decrease in abundance of free-living algae between the sites.\n They were, in order of most to least exposure to effluent from\n\nKingston Harbour: \n\n  Harbour Shoal, at the mouth of Kingston Harbour; Drunkenmans Cay,\n\nsouth and down current of Kingston Harbour; South East Cay, east and\n\nupcurrent of Kingston Harbour; and Middle Cay, about 50 miles offshore on the\n\nPedro Bank. \n\n \n\n  Coral samples were collected between January and April 1993.\n At each site, at a depth of 5-8 metres, six colonies of morphotype 2\n\n( Knowlton et al. 1992) of the reef building coral  Montastr &aeligature;\n\na annularis  ( =  Montastr &aeligature; a faveolata  , Weil &\n\nKnowlton 1994) were sampled.\n All samples were chiselled from the base of the colony and were\n\napproximately 20cm  2  .\n The samples were frozen before transportation to Canada for analysis.\n\n\n\n  N determinations\n\naccording to Le Blanc et al. ( 1989).\n First, the aragonite skeletons were dissolved in 10% hydrochloric\n\nacid.\n Following dissolution of the skeleton, endolithic algae were cleared\n\nfrom beneath the coral tissue.\n The coral tissue was then rinsed in distilled water, centrifuged and\n\nfreeze dried.\n For each sample, approximately 15mg of the freeze dried tissue was\n\ncombusted with an excess of cupric oxide at 550 &degree; C for two hours in\n\nvacuum sealed pyrex tubes.\n The gases produced by combustion were cryogenically separated to\n\nyield pure N  2  .\n Nitrogen isotope ratios were determined in a VG SIRA mass\n\nspectrometer.\n Organic standards ( gelatin, valine and glutamic acid) as well as\n\natmospheric standards for nitrogen were analysed to estimate precision of the\n\nsample nitrogen isotope ratios. \n\n  N results are reported in standard delta notation\n\nrelative to the atmospheric standard in &per-thousand; units.\n\n \n\n \n\n  Light was measured at 3 of the 4 sites in May 1995 using Hobo\n\nLight Intensity Miniature data loggers.\n These were deployed simultaneously at a depth of 8 metres at each\n\nsite for 4 days.\n The data loggers were calibrated against a Li-Cor integrating quantum\n\nradiometer/photometer ( Model no. LI 188B) fitted with a sperical underwater\n\nsensor.\n This allowed the miniature data logger readings to be converted to\n\nmicro- einsteins. \n\n  For each site the mean maximum daily reading was calculated as an\n\nindication of relative available light between sites. \n\n \n\n  Corals from the four sites had significantly different mean\n\nlevels of &delta;  15  N in their tissues ( Table 1, Figure 2): \n\n\n\n  at Harbour Shoal, 6.47 &per-thousand; &plus-minus; 0.7,\n\nDrunkenmans Cay, 4.99 &per-thousand; &plus-minus; 0.3, South East Cay, 3.05\n\n&per-thousand; &plus-minus; 0.6, and Middle Cay, 1.51 &per- thousand;\n\n&plus-minus; 0.3.\n 15 N values show a clear trend.\n 15\n\n N, but progressively less so offshore.\n N values in the\n\nsame range as those found by Altabet ( 1989) for the open ocean. \n\n  The Coefficients of Variation ( CV: Standard deviation/Mean) are\n\nquite small, 16 %.\n This can be compared with the high variability of direct measurements\n\nof water pollution.\n CV for the data on suspended particulate organic nitrogen ( Figure 1)\n\nwas 50% ( Morrison and Greenaway 1989). \n\n  Light data ( Figure 3) showed the lowest mean maximum light\n\nlevels, 233.7 &plus-minus; 64.2 microeinsteins at Harbour Shoal, closest to\n\nKingston Harbour where there were high levels of suspended particulate\n\norganic matter, and dense plankton blooms, with progressively higher levels\n\noffshore.     \n\n \n\n  N variations in coral tissue (\n\nMuscatine and Kaplan 1994, Heikoop et al. in review) have shown that coral\n\ntissue becomes more depleted ( lighter) with decreasing light levels due to\n\ndecreased fractionation by photosynthesis.\n In this study, light levels are lower nearshore, where the tissues\n\nare more enriched.\n N values is the inverse of that\n\nwhich would be due to differences in light, and much more pronounced,\n\nsuggesting that enrichment from terrestrial sources is the dominant factor.\n\n\n\n  Previous measures of terrestrial pollution in this area have been\n\nbased on direct water quality measurements ( Goodbody 1989) or benthic\n\nsurveys of indirect indicators such as benthic algae ( Head and Hendry 1985).\n Water quality measurements must be collected over an extended period\n\ndue to high variability. \n\n  In the present study, a single sampling occasion yielded an\n\napparent index of exposure to terrestrial sources of nitrogen.\n Analysis of Nitrogen isotopes could be a valuable tool for\n\ndetermination of patterns of pollution in shallow, clear tropical coastal\n\nwaters, as the method is objective and highly cost effective, requiring\n\nlittle field work. \n\n \n\n  N\n\ndeterminations and M.

{'text': "Incorporation of rainfall into modelling for optimal\n\nwater allocation on the Rio Cobre Irrigation Scheme, Jamaica  \n\n\n\n \n\n  National Irrigation Commission, 14-20 Port Royal Street,\n\nKingston, Jamaica  \n\n \n\n  Institute of Irrigation and Development Studies, University\n\nof Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK  \n\n \n A computer model has been applied to the planning and operation of the\n\nRio Cobre irrigation system to determine optimal water allocation strategies,\n\nespecially during periods of limited water supply.\n The model allows for the effect of rainfall by using historical\n\nrainfall data at prescribed probability levels to predict rainfall\n\ncontribution to irrigation over a given planning horizon.\n The rainfall information together with other operational parameters\n\nsuch as evapotranspiration, crop growth data, water availability and system\n\ncapacity are used to determine ways of allocation of water so that the value\n\nof crop production is optimized.\n The operation of the scheme was simulated over an entire season to\n\ndetermine optimal water allocation period by period.\n Each period the actual rainfall and irrigation depth for the previous\n\nwas used to update the soil moisture content to the beginning of the current\n\nperiod.\n Historical rainfall data was then used to predict rainfall inputs\n\nover the planning horizon which may be from one to five periods.\n The optimal water allocation for the current period was then\n\ndetermined.\n For comparison, the runs were repeated with varying levels of\n\npredicted rainfall.\n The results show that considering the effect of rainfall in\n\nirrigation scheduling can improve effective rainfall by reducing runoff\n\nlosses.  \n\n \n\n  Computer models are being increasingly applied to the management\n\nof irrigation schemes at the main systems level.\n The INCA model ( Bird & Makin, 1992) facilitates the processing of\n\nscheme data with its graphical database interface while the CAMSIS model (\n\nBurton, 1992) allows the user to choose from several water allocation\n\npolicies.\n Irrigation Management and Optimisation System\n\n ( IRMOS) was developed ( Hales, 1994) to facilitate optimal water\n\nallocation in irrigation systems.\n In 1992 the IRMOS model was applied to the Rio Cobre irrigation\n\nscheme, Jamaica to assess the scheme's actual performance and to evaluate\n\nsimulated performance under various operational conditions.\n The objectives of this paper are to show how rainfall was\n\nincorporated into the IRMOS model and to demonstrate the impact of rainfall\n\nprediction on various performance indicators in the scheduling of water\n\nallocation on the Rio Cobre scheme ( Fig. 1) during the study period. \n\n \n\n \n\n  The Rio Cobre Irrigation scheme is located in southern St\n\nCatherine, Jamaica and has a command area of 12 000 ha.\n The water is diverted from the Rio Cobre River into a canal network\n\nfor distribution to over 400 users growing a variety of crops.\n Annual rainfall in the irrigated areas averages less than 600 mm, of\n\nwhich 40% falls in the months of September and October.\n Figure 2 shows actual rainfall during 1992 and average rainfall for\n\nthe Innswood Station within the Rio Cobre scheme.\n\n\nwith a peak of 7 mm day  - 1  in July.\n The discharge in the river is such that the water that can be\n\ndiverted into the system is generally inadequate to meet the requirements of\n\nthe crops during some months of the growing season, even during a wet year.\n\n\n\n  The scheme grows a variety of crops including sugarcane, pasture,\n\nvegetables and freshwater fish.\n Sugarcane is by far the predominant crop accounting for 67% of the\n\ncultivated area.\n The study period covers the calendar year 1 January \x13 31 December\n\n1992.\n The diversion structure on the river was breached in May 1991,\n\nresulting in its capacity being reduced from 6 to 3 m  3  s  - 1\n\n .\n Consequently, during the study period, the average crop area\n\nirrigated by the scheme was only 4200 ha.     \n\n \n\n  The IRMOS model is a tool for computer-aided management and\n\noptimal water allocation in an irrigation system.\n The model has two main modules, one mainly for data management and\n\nthe other for water management and scheduling.\n The model is designed to allow optimal water allocation at the main\n\nsystems level on schemes with one or more sources of water, several tertiary\n\nand quaternary units and complex cropping patterns. \n\n  The data management component of the model involves the\n\nprocessing of information that describes the physical characteristics of\n\nthe scheme, climate history, seasonal information and periodic data.\n Crop coefficient and root depth for different development stages,\n\nyield response information, production costs and unit price are stored in the\n\ndatabase for each crop.\n Seasonal data describe the season, period length, planned cropping\n\npattern, expected water supply and other information required for preseason\n\nplanning.\n Periodic data include planting, harvesting, water application,\n\nrainfall and evaporation. \n\n  A schematic layout of the Rio Cobre scheme ( Fig. 1) is typical\n\nof a scheme that can be modelled by IRMOS.\n The scheme typically comprise a main and secondary canal network that\n\nsupplies water at off-takes to Water Management Units ( WMU).\n Each WMU may contain tertiary canals, farms and fields.\n For the purpose of the model each WMU contains a number of basic\n\nanalytical units called a plot.\n A plot has a unique soil type and cropping pattern, so that at any\n\npoint in time the plot's crop coefficient, yield sensitivity factor, root\n\ndepth and status can be determined. \n\n  The water management module uses the information in the database\n\nto perform the analyses necessary for planning, operating and performance\n\nassessment of an irrigation system.\n During a normal run for planning or operation, IRMOS generally\n\nestimates available water supply, determines for each plot the crop water\n\nrequirement and the expected input from rainfall.\n It then proceeds to allocate available water according to user\n\nselected water allocation policy.\n Two of the water allocation policies available in IRMOS are\n\nperformance orientated.\n One allocates water to minimize crop losses during a period and the\n\nother to maximize net benefits over a planning horizon.\n Performance assessment involves the evaluation of various performance\n\nindicators derived from data on the actual history of the scheme over a\n\nspecified number of consecutive operational periods.\n It also allows hindsight analyses by enabling the user to assess how\n\nthe scheme would have performed if it were operated differently, e.g. if\n\nrainfall probability or water allocation policy were different. \n\n \n\n  The following are the definitions of some of the performance\n\nindicators that allows IRMOS to track the performance of an irrigation\n\nscheme: \n\n \n The UDR is defined for any instance when the water allocated is less\n\nthan demand as the ratio of the shortfall to the demand.\n If there is more than one instance of water deficit then the UDR is\n\ncomputed as the ratio of the sum of all deficits to the sum of all demands.\n\n\n\n \n The OSR is defined for any instance when the volume of water\n\nallocated is higher than demand as the ratio of the volume allocated in\n\nexcess of the demand to the total volume supplied.\n If there is more than one instance of water deficit then OSR is\n\ncomputed as the ratio of the sum of all excess allocations to the sum of all\n\nallocations. \n\n \n The relative evapotranspiration of a crop is the ratio of actual\n\nevapotranspiration to potential evapotranspiration for a prescribed period.\n A relative evapotranspiration of unity indicates that the crop\n\nevaporated at its potential rate throughout the period. \n\n \n The relative yield of a crop is the ratio of actual yield to the\n\nmaximum yield expected under the growing conditions.\n Doorenbos & Kassam ( 1979) proposed the following linear relationship\n\nbetween relative yield and relative evapotranspiration for a given\n\ngrowth period: \n\n \n\n  is yield\n\nsensitivity index for the growth period, and  Er  is the relative\n\nevapotranspiration. \n\n \n The specific yield is here defined as the crop production per unit\n\nvolume of water.\n In the IRMOS model the specific yield for a water management unit is\n\ncomputed as the sum of the values of all crops harvested within the unit per\n\nmillion cubic metres of water allocated to the unit. \n\n \n The relative profitability is the ratio of net value of crop\n\nharvested within a season to the potential net value obtainable at maximum\n\nyield. \n\n \n The effective rainfall ratio is the fraction of total rainfall that\n\ncontributes to crop evapotranspiration. \n\n \n\n  Rainfall data are used in the modelling process in estimating\n\ncrop irrigation demand and to compute actual crop evapotranspiration.\n In either case the rainfall and evaporation data must be stored in\n\nthe database prior to running the water management module.\n The historical rainfall data are analysed to determine the periodic\n\nrainfall depths at various probability levels ( Sooriyarachi & Lea, 1990) and\n\nstored in that form.\n The model estimates the irrigation demand using historical data when\n\nplanning the water allocation for a given period.\n This occurs in both the pre-season planning and the in-season\n\noperational modes.\n The model computes the actual evapotranspiration in the process of\n\nupdating the soil moisture content using actual data over the previous\n\nperiod. \n\n \n\n  The water requirement of an individual crop is estimated by\n\napplying the procedures outlined by Doorenbos & Pruitt ( 1977).\n The irrigation demand at an off-take for a given period is the\n\nminimum amount of water that the scheme must allocate to ensure that all\n\ncrops within the unit commanded by the offtake evapotranspire at their\n\npotential rate.\n In computing the irrigation demand for a period the expected rainfall\n\ndepth is determined from historical rainfall data based on the dependable\n\nrainfall probability.\n The rainfall probability is chosen by the user depending on whether\n\nwet, dry or average conditions are expected during the period.\n The effective rainfall is then computed and applied to the crop's\n\nroot zone.\n Any part of the crop water requirement not met by the expected\n\neffective rainfall is the irrigation demand. \n\n \n\n  ) measured in\n\nmm day  - 1  is estimated by modelling the water balance within the\n\nroot zone of the crop.\n The root zone is considered as a reservoir to which water is added\n\nthrough irrigation or rainfall and removed by evaporation or percolation (\n\nRao, 1987).\n The actual evapotranspiration rate is equal to the potential\n\nevapotranspiration rate (  ETm  ) when the soil water content is\n\nabove the readily available water (  RAW  ) level, otherwise stress\n\noccurs and the relative evapotranspiration rate is proportional to the\n\nmoisture content of the root zone. \n\n  The soil moisture balance model in IRMOS determines the soil\n\nmoisture content in the root zone of a crop at the end of a period, given the\n\nsoil moisture content at the start of the period, the effective rainfall and\n\nirrigation depth.\n The depth of water ( mm) in the root zone of a crop at the end of a\n\ngiven period is determined generally from: \n\n  Dr\n\n +  I  +  G  +  Re  -  AET  -  L\n\n \n\n  is the moisture content of the\n\nroot zone ( mm m  - 1  ) at the start of the period, and  Dr\n\n is the rooting depth ( m).\n AET\n\n are applied irrigation depth, ground water contribution, effective\n\nrainfall and actual evapotranspiration ( mm), respectively, and  L \n\nis the depth of water ( mm) lost to runoff or percolation. \n\n  The application of the above equation in the IRMOS model is\n\nillustrated in a flow chart as presented in Fig. 3.\n The model allows for a daily or periodic update of the soil water\n\ncontent, depending on available data and level of precision required.\n At each update the irrigation depth and actual effective rainfall,\n\nare applied to the crop's root zone.\n If the total depth of water exceeds the water holding capacity of\n\nthe soil then runoff or percolation losses occur and the effective rainfall\n\nis further reduced.\n If none of the rainfall is effective, then some of the irrigation\n\nwater is lost and the irrigation efficiency is further reduced. \n\n \n\n  The model was applied to the Rio Cobre scheme to assess its\n\nperformance during the 1992 calendar year under different levels of predicted\n\nrainfall.  \n At the start of the first period, the soil moisture content, the\n\ncrop development stage and the crop condition of each plot in the scheme were\n\ninitialized in the model.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '66a49aad-03c9-4841-ae64-244712b54476', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.374767+00:00', 'english_score':

Roosevelt to the Presidency\n\nof the USA. \n\n  It was a time when agriculture and agricultural products still\n\nformed the bedrock of the Jamaican economy.\n Sugar and bananas were the primary assets, followed by citrus and\n\ncoffee.\n The manufacturing industry was confined to the centuries-old\n\nagro-industry of sugar processing. \n\n  Tourism was in its infancy, centered on Port Antonio, in\n\nassociation with the United Fruit Company\'s Boston banana trade and Montego\n\nBay, on the basis of the reportedly curative powers of the water of Doctor\'s\n\nCave.\n Kingston boasted a quintet of famous hotels: Constant Spring, Mona\n\nGreat House, Manor House, Myrtle Bank, South Camp Road, none alas, still in\n\nexistence.\n Ochos Rios was still a charming, quiet and unspoilt village with a\n\nprofusion of murmuring, soporific streams and less silent cataracts. \n\n  A few miles away, even then a focus of outings for the few\n\nnatives who could afford the trip, were the picturesque Dunn\'s River and more\n\ndramatic Roaring River Falls, the latter taken out of service since 1946 as a\n\nvenue for visitors and transformed into a source of hydro- electric power.\n Negril was primarily swamp land and would not become an objective of\n\ngovernment activity for another quarter of a century when Chief Minister and\n\nMinister of Development Norman Manley challenged the two-year old Central\n\nPlanning Unit to initiate ideas for a framework for the development of this\n\nfar western outpost. \n\n  Bauxite was already being mined and processed at MacKenzie in\n\nBritish Guiana, and a geological survey, undertaken by J.G. Sawkins 60 years\n\nbefore, had indicated the presence of large deposits of that mineral in\n\nJamaica.\n It was not until the early 1940s when Sir Alfred D\'Costa rediscovered\n\nthe cause that Jamaicans acknowledged that the red dirt in which children\n\nplayed games and the red mud which encased the wheels and mudguards of cars\n\nin the parishes of Manchester, St. Elizabeth, and St. Ann was an important\n\npotential resource.\n No one imagined at that time that bauxite would replace sugar and\n\nbananas as the country\'s leading revenue and foreign exchange earner within\n\ntwo decades. \n\n  In the depression years at the turn of the thirties the sugar\n\nindustry was in a state of crisis, suffering from a disastrous slump in world\n\nprices.\n Demand fell short of supply; the latter stimulated by European,\n\nincluding the British government\'s policy of providing subsidies for their\n\nbeet-based production.\n At that time 40 sugar factories were in operation compared to the 9\n\nwhich are in operation today.\n Other agricultural products such as citrus and coffee also faced\n\nadverse international market conditions.\n These factors and the attendant social conditions, rising\n\nunemployment and atrociously low wages were setting the stage for the riots\n\nof 1938, the emergence of Alexander Bustamante and Norman Manley, and the\n\nMoyne Commission. \n\n  Despite falling prices, the banana industry had come to the\n\nrescue of the economy, especially in St. Mary and Portland, where  green\n\ngold  formed the foundation of fortunes.\n In 1929 banana growers led by Charlie Johnson created their\n\ncooperatively owned marketing and shipping company, the Jamaica Banana\n\nProducers Association Ltd.\n \'cargo\'\n\n had begun to ply between Jamaica and London in competition with the\n\nUnited Fruit Company Ltd. \n\n  During the 1930s, banana exports were to represent almost 60% of\n\nthe total value of Jamaica\'s export trade.\n By 1937 more than 360,000 tons were exported, representing 87% of the\n\nUnited Kingdom\'s total imports of bananas.\n These figures contrast dramatically and depressingly with 1993\n\nexports of 76,770 tons or about 16% of UK imports.\n The considerable decline is a consequence of the disappearance of\n\nshipping and markets during World War II, the impact of Panama disease on\n\nproduction, and more recently, competition from Central America and the\n\nWindward Islands. \n\n  At the turn of the thirties social, economic and political life\n\nwas dominated by landed proprietors and managers of the sugar and banana\n\nplantations, and merchant- businessmen of downtown Kingston whose shops\n\nengaged in a thriving trade on the still prosperous and busy King, Harbour\n\nand Port Royal Streets.\n piers\n\njutting out on the waterfront at King, East and Hanover Streets and George\'s\n\nLane.\n Even then, the cargo traffic on drays and trucks had begun to clutter\n\nand congest the rectangular grid of narrow streets and lanes behind the\n\npiers.\n Thirty years later, the port would be moved westward to Newport West\n\nand the piers replaced by alongside quays.\n In those days King Street was the mecca of business activity as it\n\nwas to remain until the 1960s, dying gradually with the development of New\n\nKingston and the proliferation of uptown shopping plazas. \n\n  Looking down towards the harbour from the Kingston Parish Church\n\nand Parade, one saw a scene of shops on both sides of the street: L.A.\n\nHenriques, of jewellery and delicate chinaware, established on the same spot\n\nin 1918, and lower down, Nathan\'s at the corner of Barry Street, Hanna\'s, and\n\nmembers of the various Issa family enterprises.\n Interspersed among the dry goods and hardware emporia, were\n\ngovernment buildings: the Treasury, Supreme Court and Post Office\n\nheadquarters.\n The banks too were well represented: Nova Scotia, Barclays, Canadian\n\nImperial and the local Government Savings Bank.\n discrimination was\n\nat its zenith, the banks and other commercial houses, even at the lowest\n\nclerical levels, were staffed exclusively by persons of a white or high\n\ncolour/complexion. \n\n  The late Hon. Amy Bailey observed that when other commercial\n\nhouses began to hire black girls, they were not to be seen by customers at\n\nthe counter, but were  \'hidden away\'  upstairs doing the\n\nbooks.\n \'Fighting\n\nBarrister\'  Ethelred Erasmus Adolphus Campbell, and later, Mayor\n\nWalker ( father of insuranceman  \'Molo\'  ) , would break down\n\nthese barriers and open the way ultimately for the recruitment and rise to\n\nthe top of bright black natives of ability such as Douglas Folkes, Don Banks\n\nand Delroy Lindsay in the banking world. \n\n  At Christmas, King Street presented a spectacular sight of\n\nbrilliantly sparkling  starlight  , and of shops lit up and\n\ndecorated in a kaleidoscope of colours, competing with countless balloons\n\nclutched by children.\n The crowded street reverberated with cries of merriment from\n\nchildren, sounds from horns, tin whistles and the chirping of toy birds.\n rat-a-tat\n\n of the inevitable firecrackers, and the occasional thunderbolt. \n\n \n\nwould roam the streets and higglers, not yet dignified with the euphemistic\n\ndesignation  \'Informal Commercial Importers\'  ( ICIs), walked\n\nup and down from early morning, warbling their waves:  \'Buy yuh\n\ncoconut oil! Fresh Feesh! Grater cake!"  \n\n  Commercial air travel did not reach Jamaica until December 1930\n\nwith PANAM sea-planes conveying their cargo of passengers and mail.\n The few who could afford to go overseas to the USA and the UK on\n\nholiday, students and businessmen, and those migrants in search of work in\n\nthe USA, Cuba and Central America, travelled by steamer or cargo boat,\n\nsharing their voyage with export bananas. \n\n  There were no airports.\n The Palisadoes peninsula was a deserted swamp, known olny for the\n\npirates of Port Royal and for Lewis Galdy\'s miraculous survival during the\n\n1692 earthquake and tidal wave. \n\n  Outside of Kingston, the ports such as Port Antonio, Lucea and\n\nMontego Bay were actively involved in transporting incoming and outgoing\n\nfreight, while the 90-year old railway was still managed as a government\n\ndepartment and not yet converted into a statutory corporation.\n Its steam engines transported passengers and freight through the\n\npock-marked Cockpits and lush hinterland to the west and northeast coasts and\n\nto inland Frankfield.\n The new dimensions of dominance by overland lorries and bustling\n\nbuses remained a distant dream of a rare few.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'bc2f7f82-eee8-4e82-b320-afb4651fab2a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.376088+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9675524234771729, 'non_english_score': 0.03244757652282715}
{'text': 'Anyone who visits the ruins of early civilizations, will soon come\n\nto realize that they have at least one thing in common: people lived in\n\nterror.\n The evidence of this can be seen on the very walls of the temples and\n\npalaces where the cruelty of the methods used to sacrifice were depicted.\n It was normal for the lives of their most valuable young citizens to\n\nbe given in a vain attempt to propitiate their gods.\n To these ancestors of ours, every aspect of life must have been\n\nhostile and inexplicable.\n There seemed nothing that could be done to protect the individual from\n\nthe environment except through magic.\n The gods had to be propitiated because they were thought to cause the\n\nthings that everyone feared - disease, injury, famine, flood and drought.\n All of these afflicted humanity for no apparent reason.\n There seemed to be no alternative to sacrificing the few in the hope\n\nthat the  " gods"  would spare the many. \n\n  It is to the Greek philosophers of the fifth century BC that we\n\nowe an eternal debt for their application of logic to the study of nature.\n The result was to construct a new system - the Hippocratic system -\n\nbased on the firm idea that disease was due to natural phenomena rather than\n\nto magic, astrology or theology.\n This represented a major leap forward in the development of\n\nmankind.\n They had been able to penetrate the darkness and sift the true and\n\naccurate from the mass of speculation. \n\n  leaps in thought are repeated\n\nagain and again in the history of mankind.\n Perhaps the earliest we know about may be attributed to the great\n\nEgyptian Pharaoh, Akhenaten, who as early as the tenth century BC, introduced\n\nthe concept of one all-embracing God instead of the universally accepted\n\npantheon of competing and conflicting deities. \n\n  Although so little is left of Greek Art, what has survived is\n\nstill supreme in literature, sculpture, prose and poetry.\n None of the great civilizations that preceded or surrounded the\n\nGreeks could act as a model.\n With them something quite new came into the world: the love of\n\nknowledge based on fact, not speculation.\n They were the first Westerners; the spirit of the West, the modern\n\nspirit, is a Greek discovery and the place of the Ancient Greeks is secure in\n\nthe modern world. \n\n  Joy of life had come into the world and found expression.\n The Greeks were the first people in the world to play, and they\n\nplayed on a grand scale.\n All over Greece there were games of every description.\n Every fourth year the great Games ( the Olympics) were held and\n\nconsidered to be of such importance that a most sacred truce was called so\n\nthat anyone could travel in safety to compete or just to watch  "\n\nglorious- limbed youth"  at their best.\n An Olympic victor took precedence over triumphing generals.\n His crown of wild olives was set beside the prize of the tragedian,\n\nthe greatest of all. \n\n  Communications were much better in those days than seems credible\n\nto us now.\n In fact, as the caravans conveyed goods for sale from one end of the\n\nknown world to the other, the merchants would end the day sitting under the\n\nstars and discussing the new ideas from each country they passed through.\n The remarkable similarity between so many of the thoughts of Socrates\n\nand Plato, the Buddha, Confucius and Zoroaster - who all lived within a\n\ncentury of each other - and the theologies of Taoism and Judaism are thus\n\nonly to be expected. \n\n  Rational thought, rather than theological, and the origins of the\n\nscientific method started with the Greek philosophers, particularly\n\nAristotle.\n " Nature does\n\nnothing in vain." \n There was purpose and logic to be found everywhere in nature and this\n\nwas as applicable to disease as to any other natural phenomenon.\n\n\n  As far as medicine and surgery are concerned, we must attribute\n\nour origins largely to the School of Hippocrates.\n As the master strolled under the plane trees outside his home in Kos,\n\nhe reasoned with his flowers about the nature of the world.\n Those plane trees are still in existence.\n It was from these discussions that Hippocrates formulated the three\n\nbasic tenets of the life of a physician.\n They are as applicable today as they were two thousand, five hundred\n\nyears ago and form the most important part of the Hippocratic Oath. \n\n  First, he stated that disease is due to natural processes rather\n\nthan to magic or superstition.\n Therefore, treatment should be based on reason and logic.\n\n\ntion of the body to that disease and thirdly, that the physician\'s objective\n\nmust be to aid the body\'s natural processes of repair. \n\n  These ideas, once accepted, set the stage for all the advances\n\nwhich have rid mankind of so much pain and suffering.\n The contrast between the calm logic of Hippocratic ideas and the\n\nhorror which had always existed up to that time is almost incredible.\n For the first time man had no need to strive ineffectively to protect\n\nhimself from the inclemency of nature or the terror of hostile gods.\n "\n\nwholistic"  or  " broad"  .\n However, just across the water from Kos there is the island of Cnidia\n\nwhere another very active philosophical school was attracting attention.\n The Cnidians started from the other end of the scale and concentrated\n\nall their interest on the diseased area alone and paid scant attention to the\n\nwhole person, which was the very basis of the Hippocratic method.\n thinking has been termed\n\n " reductionism"  . \n\n  We will see how, over the centuries, the pendulum has swung back\n\nand forth favouring first one philosophy and then the other.\n Both ways of thinking have their uses and the progress derived from\n\nboth approaches has contributed to produce the health care systems of today.\n\n\n\n  When Alexander the Great conquered Egypt, he gave it to the\n\ngreatest of his generals, his half-brother Ptolemy Soter.\n\n\npharaohs   whose members had no Egyptian blood in their veins at all.\n Ptolemy was convinced that the Greek way of life was supreme and\n\ndetermined to make Alexandria into a second Athens.\n His son was to make Alexandria the academic centre of the world by\n\nbuying up any library that he knew was for sale and then by collecting a copy\n\nof every book that entered his kingdom. \n\n  The result was astonishing.\n Soon there were three-quarters of a million papyrus scrolls available\n\nfor study and scholars flocked to work there.\n All the works of Homer, Hippocrates and Aristotle were edited in\n\nAlexandria and it is believed that Aristotle\'s personal library formed the\n\nbasis of Ptolemy\'s own collection. \n\n  Scholars of every type were welcomed from all over the world.\n Buddhists from India mixed with Egyptian priests and there were more\n\nJews in Alexandria than in Jerusalem.\n " museum"\n\n .\n At its height, there were fourteen thousand students studying there\n\nand every form of knowledge was available for study with well-paid teachers\n\nin each.\n They were given the facilities for research that they needed and were\n\nlooked upon as the élite of the kingdom.\n Medicine was always considered to be one of the most important areas\n\nof study and there were fine dissecting rooms for the study of anatomy.\n The physicians taught Hippocratic medicine and stressed the generally\n\naccepted principle that the  " proper study of mankind"  will\n\nalways be Man himself. \n\n  Later, in the time of the Arabian ascendency from the eighth to\n\nthe thirteenth centuries, medicine was to rise to even greater heights and\n\nwas considered to be the purest and highest form of philosophical study. \n\n  The study of human anatomy was conceived in Egypt and developed\n\nby the Greeks living in Alexandria.\n The brilliance of the Greeks had not enabled them to learn much about\n\nhuman anatomy because human dissection was culturally not acceptable.\n However, the peculiar preparation of the Egyptian body, essential for\n\nmummification, was ideally suited to the study of anatomy. \n\n  The Egyptian embalmer removed all the viscera through a 4-inch\n\nincision in the left loin.\n The heart and aorta alone were left in place.\n " canopic"\n\n jars later to be interred with the carefully preserved  "\n\nmummy"  .\n The Alexandrine scholars watched this intricate process closely\n\nand learnt the arrangement of the human viscera and noted how they differed\n\nfrom that of animals on which their surmises about the functions and form of\n\nhuman organs had previously been based.\n It was simple for them to correlate the signs and symptoms of the\n\ndisease which had caused death with the changed appearance of the viscera -\n\nthe start of the study of both pathology and physiology. \n\n  The study of medicine reached its next peak with that most\n\nattractive of men, Claudius Galen of Pergamon, one hundred and fifty years\n\nlater.\n Galen worked in Alexandria for 10 years where he met the future\n\nEmperor Severus who recommended him to the reigning Emperor, Marcus Aurelius.\n Marcus Aurelius, being himself a famous Stoic philosopher, greatly\n\nadmired Galen\'s writings.\n When he reached Rome, he became the imperial physician.\n As the result of this, and because he happened to be a brilliant and\n\nmost amusing lecturer, Galen became the most famous and distinguished\n\nphysician since Hippocrates.\n His writings were to become, most unfortunately, the accepted dogma\n\nof the Church, and thus for the western world, for a thousand years. \n\n  This was partly his own fault because he came to have such\n\nimplicit faith in the accuracy and finality of his own studies that he gave\n\nothers the impression that they were  " God-given"  .\n He rationalized the importance of his work by basing it on the\n\nlogic of his own conclusions, stating that  " the proper way to\n\nworship was not by prayer or sacrifice but by experiment and observation in\n\norder to understand His ways so as to bring perfection to all things"\n\n .\n He considered himself to be the direct heir of Hippocrates and,\n\nbelieved that because structure and function had been created in the\n\nperfection he had himself described, no further investigation was needed.\n\n\n\n  This was accepted as true by his contemporaries and successors,\n\nbecoming the fixed doctrine of the universal Christian church.\n What Galen said was believed to be truth itself.\n It was Galen who advised bleeding the patient to remove adverse\n\n " humours"  .\n was\n\nessential in the healing of tissues.\n "\n\nopposites"  which was lacking in any rational factual basis.\n " Dark\n\nAges"  and progress was to become the province of the Arabian physi\n\n<l> cians.\n Galen was, unfortunately, not only a master of medical practice but\n\nof self-promotion. \n\n  In spite of the unfortunate effect his work was to have, he was a\n\ngreat and brilliant man whose life was summed up by the words written for him\n\nat his death by his friend, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius: \n\n \n\n\n\n  Soon Galen\'s original teaching was to become overlaid with\n\nsuperstition because the physician was taught to accept rather than to think\n\nand learn from experience.\n This attitude held back any form of progress in medicine until the\n\nRenaissance. \n\n  The western world was to become wracked by almost continuous war\n\nwhich characterized these so-called Dark Ages.\n The foremost school of medicine at the time was in Constantinople,\n\ndirected by the Patriarch Nestorius.\n He and his Fellows were driven out of Turkey and fled to Edessa and\n\nNisibis in the region which is now part of Iraq, where they were

{'text': "The Kingston art scene has been enlivened in the past two\n\nyears or so by an unexpected development: the opening of eight new\n\ngalleries.\n The first in 1989 was Babylon Gallery, followed by the gallery\n\nextension at Patoo, Gallery Pegasus, the Palette, Chelsea Galleries and the\n\nArt Gallery.    \n\n  The addition of Four Corners Gallery and Gallery Petite, has\n\neffectively doubled the number of show rooms for  work\n\nin the city. \n\n \n\n  Recent trends in the art scene, and the Jamaican society at large,\n\nwould tempt an immediate answer.\n Undoubtedly, with the help of inflation, art prices have soared\n\ntremendously in the last few years, revealing the benefits of art as an\n\ninvestment and thus creating a new group of art collectors.\n Is this simply a response to, an attempt to cash in on, this\n\ntrend?\n Or is it, to some extent, a response to fundamental deficiencies in\n\nthe older galleries? \n\n \n\n  Colin F Christ, managing director of what was Babylon Jamaica\n\nLimited at the time of our interview and now Colin F. Art Works, would affirm\n\nthe latter.\n One of our more avant- garde young artists, Colin says he was\n\ndissatisfied with his treatment by the established galleries.\n In his opinion, they had a limited appreciation of fine art and were\n\nunsure of work that departed from the traditional.\n Frustrated by what he saw as their narrow vision and their\n\ninability to make independent assessments, Colin decided to create a speace\n\nin which he could show his own work and that of other similarly frustrated\n\nartists. \n\n  The gallery occupies a room on the ground floor of a delightful\n\nold house on West King's House Road in a compound in which Colin and a\n\nnumber of other young people reside.\n In this somewhat bohemian setting, the gallery has held some ten\n\nexhibitions, showing such artists as Beti Campbell, Petrona Morrison, Mike\n\nStanley and Giselle Valdez, as well as Colin himself. \n\n  Exhibitions alternate with a stock show; and in one corner of the\n\nroom Colin sells his very popular tee-shirts as well as jewellery and\n\nceramics.\n The gallery has also held one exhibition of Haitian art and one\n\nphotography show - the latter attesting to Colin's assertion that the quick\n\nsale is low on his list of criteria for exhibitions. \n\n  'The work must appeal to me.\n What I'm most interested in is new ideas, individual statements, work\n\nthat contains some commentary - whether or not it's\n\nintentional&dotted-line;\n I'm concerned about opening up people's minds, promoting freedom\n\nof thought.\n\n\n  Such priorities are already evident in Babylon.\n Exhibitions have tended to the avant-garde and the gallery's style is\n\nclearly defined.\n These same priorities, on the other hand, don't pay bills.\n But Colin is quite matter-of-fact about this, stating that the\n\ngallery is something he does for love.\n he\n\nsays,  'pushing sales.\n\n\n  'Our\n\nartists are some of the few who haven't been dazzled by devaluation' \n\n- and content, if sometimes tending to theatrical, has been faithful to the\n\ngallery's theme.\n The space is too small for large works, but it holds its own.\n Ideally, Colin would like to mount seven to eight shows a year but\n\nonly if they can be strong enough.\n He has his doubts.\n 'Art activity is not very vibrant now.\n I'm disappointed to find that it comes down to survival - a lot of\n\nartists seem to think it's more important to make a living by mass\n\nproduction&dotted-line;\n\n\n  After an exciting first year only two shows, including one which\n\nfeatured Colin F. and his then partner Nayr, were held in 1990.\n Is Babylon dying?\n Colin seems unperturbed.\n 'We've been taking things easy recently&dotted-line; but I'm\n\nin no hurry.\n\n\n  A conversation with the owner of Chelsea Galleries, Tina\n\nMatkovic-Spiro, suggests, albeit indirectly, that she too was not altogether\n\nhappy with the operation of the older established galleries.\n 'We plan to be specialized - not in terms of style, but high\n\nquality&dotted- line;\n Quality seems to be there only intermittently with many of the\n\nother galleries.\n We would rather have no show at all than lapse into mediocrity.'\n\n \n\n  The gallery, notably small, occupies part of a converted house on\n\nChelsea Avenue ( her husband's architectural firm takes up the rest).\n 'We\n\nhave our commitment.' \n 'We won't be mixing the art\n\nbusiness with any other business.\n There will be no knick-knacks.\n\n\n \n\ngalleries'  treatment of artists:  'We have a commitment to our\n\nartists.\n We want to see this gallery run the way I myself would like to have\n\nbeen treated&dotted-line; building the artist's reputation, not just hanging\n\nand selling; becoming personally involved in helping them develop their\n\ncareers and reputation; marketing their work abroad&dotted-line; trying\n\nto look out for them financially.'  \n\n  Chlesea Galleries also has a strong commitment to its clientele,\n\noffering a personalized service.\n 'We want to offer the best quality work that can be had at\n\nthe best possible price&dotted-line;\n We don't believe in the hard sell, the hasty approach.\n Selling is like adoption - you try to match the buyer with the piece.\n In placing it, let there be communication between those who made it\n\nand those who bought it&dotted-line;\n In the end the artist is happy that his work is\n\nappreciated&dotted-line;'  \n\n  An estimated one-third of the gallery's time now goes to\n\ncorporate clients.\n 'Serious corporate investors will find that they have gaps in\n\ntheir collection - for example, one artist, or one artist's work of a\n\nparticular period.\n They're inclined to a speciality - and we're happy to fulfil those\n\nspecial needs.'  \n\n  The Chelsea is interested in new artists.\n Some of the exhibitions that the gallery has mounted to date have\n\nbeen noteworthy in their combination of new and old names - the women's\n\nexhibition held early in 1990, for example.\n 'This one was very well received - it's been our most\n\nsuccessful exhibition to date.\n\n\n  Tina wants to launch several different types of shows.\n 'Next Wave'\n\n featuring  'the young Jamaican avantgarde'  ,\n\nwas held in July - a solo exhibition of works by twenty-three year old\n\nAnna Ruth Henriques.\n is another series, featuring\n\nmainly large-scale, investment quality works of art particularly chosen to\n\nsuit board rooms, offices and public spaces.\n Launched in August, this six-week rotating exhibition presented works\n\nby artists such as Alexander Cooper, Cecil Cooper, Rachel Fearing, Sherida\n\nLevy, George Rodney and Patrick Waldemar.\n , featuring the\n\nworks of pioneer Eugene Hyde, as well as David Boxer, Hope Brooks and other\n\nartists who have had a long-term commitment to abstraction. \n\n  'We want to do things that are not just sales\n\nopportunities but historical perspectives &dotted-line;'  \n\n  What about cataloguing?\n 'That will come in time.\n It needs hefty financial sponsorship, and at the moment it's low on\n\nthe list of corporate sponsors.\n So for now that will have to be left to the National Gallery and\n\nlarge foreign firms.'  \n\n  A few of the Chelsea's shows to date have not been remarkable in\n\nterms of quality but generally speaking, Chelsea Galleries and its owner give\n\nan impression of serious commitment.\n 'the\n\nart historical approach, not the hasty approach.' \n\n \n\n  Gallery Pegasus housed in the lobby area of the Jamaica Pegasus\n\nHotel does not have such aspirations.\n Pat Ramsay, the gallery's consultant curator, originally conceived of\n\nthis gallery as  'not putting an emphasis on exhibitions.\n We're talking about a different audience here - a captive audience of\n\ntourists.\n It's less a gallery than a salon - aiming at outreach exposure of our\n\nart.'  \n\n  Indeed, only one exhibition other than the opening show was held\n\nin the gallery's first fifteen months:  'Choices'  , featuring\n\nthe works of eight young Jamaican artists including Robert Cookhorne (\n\n 'African'  ) , Stanford Watson, Valentine Fairclough and\n\nRafiki Karuki.\n The exhibition received good reviews and was, according to Pat,\n\nexciting to curate because of the high quality of work. \n\n  However, the hotel wanted more exhibitions, and October-December,\n\n1990 saw three shows mounted back-to-back:  'We Three' \n\nfeaturing Ray Jackson, Beti Campbell and Michael Layne, then Brian\n\nMcFarlane followed by Francis Henriques.\n According to gallery manager Vera Ennis, the gallery has no\n\nparticular leaning towards any one style, except that  'the work must\n\nbe good.\n We're trying to promote new Jamaican artists who are doing\n\nprofessional work.'  \n\n  Interestingly, Pat say that because of its location ( it's right\n\noutside the entrance to the coffee shop), the gallery has attracted a steady\n\nflow of Jamaicans who would otherwise never set foot in such a place, being\n\ntoo intimidated by an impression of elitism. \n\n  The stock on view at the gallery seems to reflect this attempt at\n\na wider appeal, with a pot-pourri of styles and standards which attest to its\n\noriginal role as salon.\n But it is evident that in recent months some effort has been made to\n\nimprove the quality and presentation of the works - an important\n\ndevelopment if the Gallery Pegasus is to continue in its evolution into a\n\nproper gallery. \n\n  No such uncertainty is evident in Michelle Clarke, owner of the\n\nPalette Gallery on Haining Road in New Kingston.\n For Michelle, the role of the Palette is to give exposure to young\n\nartists.\n In her opinion, the older galleries were, except for one or two\n\n 'young generation'  shows every year, paying little attention\n\nto this group of artists, while lining up for the more established ones.\n\n\nance,'  Michelle says. \n\n  Twenty-nine year old Michelle has no illusions about being an art\n\nexpert.\n 'I've always been interested in art, but my training is in\n\nsales.' \n The idea of opening a gallery was born when she saw the difficulties\n\nexperienced by her artist brother-in-law, Ray Jackson, when he was trying to\n\nsell his work.\n\n\n  The Palette, which ( again) occupies a section of a converted old\n\nhouse, has a small exhibition space, with an even smaller stock area, and an\n\nadjoining gift shop which carries pieces by unknowns as well as by more\n\nfamiliar names.\n 'It\n\nallows a decent show with impact.' \n And, in fairness, shows hung recently have successfully\n\nhandled such constraints. \n\n  The thrust of the gallery has been group shows, including what\n\nwill become an annual showing of  'the best graduates of the School of\n\nArt'  .\n More recently a number of more established artists, such as Trevor\n\nFigueroa, Phillip Supersad and David Dunn, have been featured in solo\n\nexhibitions.\n Possibly because of the target market, works at the Palette have\n\ntended to the realist.\n Notwithstanding any unevenness in quality of works, shows have been\n\nconsistently well presented.\n input is encouraged in planning, hanging and\n\npromoting a show.\n 'because of the\n\ncost'  . \n\n  Shows are held once a month.\n Each group show has its own theme, for example, miniatures,\n\ndrawings, ceramics.\n Michelle's stated objective here is two-fold.\n Firstly, to allow artists to exhibit three to five times a year;\n\nsecondly, to prevent the viewer from getting bored. \n\n  This translates to increasing sales.\n One may tend to become sceptical.\n Three to five exhibitions a year may be good for the artist in terms\n\nof income, but at what cost to quality? \n\n  Yet such scepticism is tempered by the energy and enthusiasm of\n\nMichelle's marketing thrust.\n She says that she actively seeks sales from the market of young\n\nentrepreneurs and professionals, enticing them with the moderate prices\n\nof newly-launched artists, encouraging them to buy art as an investment, an\n\nasset that is guaranteed to appreciate - though she is quick to say that this\n\nis not the main thrust of her sales pitch.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '26941329-aa45-40df-b658-77da3188d0d8', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.379212+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9763128161430359, 'non_english_score': 0.02368718385696411}
{'text': 'The National Gallery of Jamaica has paid homage to John\n\nDunkley in an exhibition which opened on 10 December 1991, the hundredth\n\nanniversary of Dunkley\'s birth.\n Apart from a few pieces by Dunkley, the exhibition consisted of works\n\nby twenty-seven Jamaican artists each of whom feels some special relationship\n\nwith this original and very private artist.\n A book on Dunkley\'s life and works is to be published by the Gallery.\n\n\n\n  Comparatively little is known of Dunkley\'s life.\n As a young man he went to work in Panama where he began to paint.\n Some of his years there were spent at sea as a sailor and he saw much\n\nof the world.\n He returned to Jamaica in his thirties, married, settled down and\n\nopened a barber shop.\n There he continued to paint his mysterious, enigmatic landscapes and\n\ngardens inhabited by spiders, frogs, crabs and other small creatures.\n He also carved in wood, producing unusual pieces filled with energy\n\nand, sometimes, humour.\n His work was recognized in Jamaica and abroad; he won a medal at the\n\n1939 New York Work\'s Fair for  \'notable contribution to the art of the\n\nworld\'  and four of his paintings were exhibited in London in 1946.\n\n\n  Kay Anderson examines three of Dunkley\'s paintings and opens a\n\npathway into his interior landscape.  \n\n  Almost all of John Dunkley\'s paintings are landscapes, but they\n\nare the landscapes of his own imaginary world.\n These extraordinary fantasies of mood draw the viewer into paintings\n\nwhere the flora is menacing, where long, lonely roads to the edge of beyond\n\npass dark, truncated trees and the way ahead seems to be barred by cobwebs.\n Strange creatures hide in corners and even the least menacing of the\n\npaintings has a sombre tone. \n\n  The three paintings examined here were selected because,\n\ntogether, they represent most of Dunkley\'s range. \n\n \n\n  Mixed media on hardboard, 17" x 14 ½" ( 42.5 x 36.25 cm).\n\n \n\n  Dated about 1940, this is not a typical Dunkley, in that it is\n\nnot simply a landscape.\n The subject matter is that of the Good Shepherd feeding his sheep.\n The focus of the painting is a portrait of Bustamante, set slightly\n\nto left of centre, the tall figure squeezed into the rectangle of the\n\npainting, almost forming a semi-circle. \n\n  Immediately behind the figure is a dark road bordered sharply by\n\na thrusting diagonal fence.\n In the forefront beyond the edge of the fence, foliage peeps out\n\nand to the left, locked deep within the picture plane, is a dark ominous\n\narea.\n A lamb, apparently smiling, is lying on some sort of rock in the\n\nforefront left, immediately behind Bustamante\'s legs. \n\n  Bustamante appears to be feeding a flock of sheep which fill the\n\ncentre right front and deep space of the picture plane.\n The sheep at the back seem to be on a different level and are more\n\nwidely scattered but are moving in the direction of the central human figure.\n The foreground sheep are closely packed, almost forming a triangle\n\nfacing Bustamante.\n They have eyes only for him.\n In the background left, five sheep have strayed from the flock.\n One is halfway through the fence about to plunge into the abyss in\n\nwhich the second is lost, while three others race headlong down the dark\n\nroad. \n\n  A full moon, well lit at the top and dark underneath, rises above\n\nthe crest of the slope at the top right-hand corner of the picture.\n Slightly to the left of the moon, a white bird, its wings outspread,\n\nflies in the direction of the central figure.\n At the lower right-hand side is an example of the heavy leafy motif\n\nwhich is a hallmark of Dunkley\'s work. \n\n  The almost monochromatic colour of the painting, relieved only by\n\nspots of green and red, lends a sombre cast to the picture.\n Dunkley uses lines to shape the sharp diagonals of the fence, and to\n\noutline the features of the model and the sheep as well as to delineate the\n\nshape of the sheep and the form of the fence.\n Lines are used to define as well as to outline.\n The modelled areas suggest volume, define the shadows around the\n\nfigure and create the moon. \n\n  Texture is also a hallmark of Dunkley\'s work and in this\n\npainting, especially in the sheep, he experiments with various textures.\n wool, the\n\nleaves, Bustamante\'s clothing, facial features and hair.\n The background is more thinly painted, almost washed or scrubbed\n\nof paint.\n\n\n  Dunkley\'s gift for design is obvious in this work.\n The division of the canvas is classical in its proportions, the\n\nfigure cutting the canvas into two asymmetrical sections.\n\n\nance of the main figure, which is itself curved to fit into the canvas.\n This stance reinforces the suggestion of caring on the part of the\n\nshepherd as he appears attentive to the needs of his flock.\n A diagonal line zigzags behind Bustamante from the lower left-hand\n\ncorner to the top right-hand corner and carries the eye across the picture\n\nplane so that it has to focus on the central character.\n\n\ncharacteristic   of Dunkley\'s compositional technique. \n\n  In using a prominent political activist as the central character\n\nin a painting entitled  The Good Shepherd  , Dunkley was making a\n\nstrong political statement, for the good shepherd is one who cares for his\n\nsheep and keeps them safe from harm.\n Dunkley\'s daughter, Joyce Canaan, has informed us of Dunkley\'s\n\nadmiration for Bustamante, and this painting testifies to the regard in which\n\nhe held the politician.\n for thousands of Jamaicans during this\n\nperiod, Bustamante was seen as the emerging leader, shepherd, deliverer.\n The symbolism of the sheep running away in the background while\n\nanother leans over the edge of a crevasse at the bottom of which a fifth is\n\nbarely discernible, speaks of those sheep which have already been led astray\n\nand will become lost.\n The white bird possibly symbolizes the dove of peace, again another\n\nbiblical allusion, and it too is headed in Bustamante\'s direction. \n\n  This painting is remarkably self-contained.\n Everything which needs to be said is said.\n It operates on many levels as portrait, as religious allusion, as\n\npolitical statement.\n It is at once literal and illusionary, real and surreal.\n It is valuable from the point of view of the social history as well\n\nas in an artistic context.\n Beautifully designed, it presents a strong visual, artistic and\n\nsocial statement giving clues as to the mental processes of the artist while\n\nat the same time being valuable to the Jamaican public. \n\n \n\n \n\n  This landscape is typical of Dunkley\'s work.\n The central plane of the painting is filled by a well defined,\n\nheart-shaped flower bed in which different varieties of flowers grow.\n Left and right of this heart-shaped bed are two others, at slightly\n\ndifferent angles, in which are large flowers and typically Dunkley shrubs.\n On each side stands a huge ceramic Spanish jar ( still a popular\n\nfeature in the Jamaica of that period and a reminder of the years of Spanish\n\noccupation).\n From the jars grow equally large leafy plants leaning towards each\n\nother across the picture plane.\n Immediately in front of the jars are what at first appear to be\n\nlopped off tree trunks but on closer inspection they prove to be the ends of\n\nwooden fences.\n The four rails are made from saplings and these, together with the\n\nfinal upright post, are almost all that can be seen of each fence. \n\n  At the very front of the picture plane, immediately in front of\n\nthe heart and defining it on either side, is a pathway which peters out in\n\nthe distance.\n There are bare footprints on this path, as if someone had walked\n\naround the front of the picture and left his mark.\n In the background, flowers in beds spring on either side of the path\n\nwhile trees can be discerned in the distant top quadrant of the painting.\n Peeping over the top of the rust-coloured trees is a strip of sky,\n\nominous in its tones. \n\n  This painting is colourful by Dunkley\'s standards.\n Ochres, green, reds, rusts, yellows are blended into the sombre\n\nblues, dull whites and blacks.\n As usual, white is used to highlight every detailed petal, sepal and\n\nleaf and to illuminate the gateway in the distance through which the road\n\npasses to nowhere and everywhere. \n\n  Dunkley uses line to differentiate the various types of foliage\n\nand to add definition to the shape of the heart-shaped flower bed, the\n\nfootprints, the fences and the Spanish jars.\n But volume is not forgotten as can be seen in the painting of the\n\nbody of the jars which are carefully modelled.\n Colour is used almost as chiaroscuro and lends itself to an\n\ninterpretation that something ominous, threatening, is about to take place in\n\nthis seemingly peaceful setting. \n\n  As one is drawn into the picture plane the feeling of foreboding\n\nincreases as the darkness encloses, the road narrows, vision becomes limited\n\nand the rust red tree tops outlining the darkly threatening skies call forth\n\nthe feeling of blood, of death, of infinity.\n , can remind the viewer\n\nof the Garden of Gethsemane, a place of prayer, with its portent of death and\n\nthe unknown lurking in its midst. \n\n  The technical elements of composition, form, and colour\n\nenhance the subject matter and help to create a mood which makes this not\n\nsimply another landscape but a landscape of the surreal, almost a twilight\n\nzone where one crosses from the seemingly innocuous into the macabre, the\n\nunnatural. \n\n  Yet for those who do not care to enter the garden, but simply\n\nprefer to view it from outside, the painting is a straightforward statement\n\nof the bounty of nature in all its lushness.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Dunkley produced two Jerboa paintings.\n The one discussed is the larger of the two, painted in 1939.\n It shows a woodland scene with a distant landscape beyond.\n The picture is divided into five horizontal levels, with a sixth upon\n\nwhich stands  \'an imaginary animal\'  , a kangaroo-legged rat.\n He stands above a branch with seven leaves and a little triangle in\n\nwhich three fishes swim.\n Girl Sitting on\n\nWall  , where the curve of a cut-stone wall emerges from the lower right\n\nof the canvas to lead the viewer to the far left, then deeper into the upper\n\ncentre of the painting.\n This device takes the viewer through the painting, pausing to observe\n\ndetails along the way but always to be caught back by the compelling curve.\n is formed by the trunk\n\nof the tree rising from its roots in the front plane of the picture.\n Low on the left side of the tree is the branch on which the Jerboa\n\nstands and midway along the trunk are five branches - four of them sprouting\n\nleaves, and one a post-phallic symbol.\n However, the tree trunk does not curve back into the centre of the\n\npicture but follows the left edge of the composition to disappear into the\n\nmysterious depths of the canopy of large leaves stretching across the top of\n\nthe painting.\n From this canopy hang three spiders on long threads which lead the\n\neye down to the web at the lower centre.\n The three spiders comprise an isosceles triangle in the foreground\n\nand mid-ground.\n are\n\ninhabited by animals in the lower left-hand corner; the Jerboa in the Dunkley\n\ncreation of that name and in  Girl Sitting on Wall  , with a crab -\n\na symbol in some societies of the opposition of life and death. \n\n  If this painting with its eerie spider web, and the three\n\nwaiting spiders, is discussing the entanglement or entrapment of life and\n\nother life-related issues, it is an easy leap to imagine that the three\n\nfishes are a symbol of the Trinity which governs life before, now, and in the\n\nhereafter.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '069c97ae-1160-4ecb-93b6-4676b8a3f250', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.380560+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': "Seventy-five artists had work on display in the 1992 Annual\n\nNational Exhibition at the National Gallery.\n Forty-two of them had been invited to participate and the others had\n\nbeen chosen by a panel of qualified selectors from work submitted.  \n\n \n\n  The artists could be classified as mainstream ( trained) and\n\nintuitive ( self-taught), and their works covered an extensive array of art\n\nforms: Painting, Drawing, Collage, Original Prints, Sculpture, Assemblage,\n\nCeramics, and Fibre Arts. \n\n  Maybe the most outstanding aspect of this show was the wide\n\nvariety of themes presented, ranging from wide social issues through to\n\nintrospective examinations. \n\n  Nineteen ninety-two was notable for two significant events in the\n\nhistory and culture of Jamaica: the recognition of Columbus's first voyage to\n\nthe Caribbean and the archaeological find of valuable Taino sculptures\n\nin a cave in St Ann.\n Craig's two mixed media pieces from the\n\n All That Glitters, El Dorado, Columbus  Series, individually titled\n\n Textures of New Seville  and  New Seville  , expressed in\n\nhighly textural compositions the Spanish  quest for gold\n\nin the Caribbean and the Americas.\n Craig used a variety of metallic tones of gold and brown with red and\n\nblue injected to add richness and balance to the sparkle of the gold and the\n\ndullness of the brown.\n Geometric shapes, mainly rectangular, sectionalized the paintings\n\nwhile free-form lines in the background connected the shapes, creating\n\npleasing textures. \n\n  The archaeological find was celebrated by David Boxer in his\n\nmixed-media triptych  Revival ( Taino Birdman)  made up of twelve\n\npanels, mixed-media on paper, and  Tainototenlieder  , four\n\nceramic/assemblage panels.\n The panels in both works are fairly small, 20.5 x 26 cm and 25.5 x\n\n20.5 cm respectively.\n A solid union between the rich texture and colour is conveyed by the\n\nimpasto technique and the interconnectedness of the other objects and\n\nmaterials used in the composition.\n Boxer, as usual, coins his own titles, based on the themes suggested\n\nby his work.\n is formed by adding two German words,\n\n toten  ( death) and  lieder  ( songs) to the word Taino,\n\nthe Arawaks who inhabited Jamaica, resulting in a word which suggests Taino\n\ndeath songs or Taino dirges. \n\n  , Tina Matkovic-Spiro combines\n\nboth themes; the arrival of Christopher Columbus at Seville, St Ann and, to a\n\ngreater degree, the environment of the Arawaks.\n Painted in Matkovic-Spiro's usual style of magical realism, this\n\nnarrative picture captures the sensuous folds of the mountains in the\n\nbackground, the turfts of trees on the hillside in the middle distance and,\n\nin the foreground, recognizable trees such as poinciana, mango, poui, banana,\n\nand coconut.\n Whether or not all of these grew in Jamaica when Columbus arrived is\n\nirrelevant.\n It is an idyllic landscape which is being presented here.\n In the background, the coast glides behind the mountains and three\n\ntiny ships rock gently in the bay.\n Little circular buildings dot the landscape and a lone Arawak\n\nlooks towards the coast.\n An orange flame flickers above the highest point, the Arawak signal\n\nfire at Blow Fire Hill which forewarns the Arawaks of their impending fate.\n Measuring 92.5 x 427 cm, this diptych was by far the largest painting\n\nin the show. \n\n  Environmental awareness was a major topical issue in 1992.\n A regard for nature has always been a characteristic of the\n\nartist, therefore those in Jamaica who have repeatedly presented concern\n\nfor the environment in their works should feel encouraged.\n The positive and the negative aspects, in terms of environmental\n\nissues, were addressed.\n The positive was highlighted in the landscapes and flower\n\npaintings on show.\n Heather Sutherland-Wade exhibited two very tranquil acrylic\n\npaintings;  Of The Hills  and  Africa Blooms  .\n The first was notable for the romantic interplay of light between the\n\nhills and the fluid watercolour effect of the technique. \n\n  Laura Facey Cooper, however, explored the destruction of the\n\nenvironment in a gouache on paper painting titled  Pollution  .\n She also used gouache and pastel on paper for a fascinating painting\n\ncalled  Refuge  .\n nests joined together,\n\nsuggesting the security that might be found in a healthy home and social\n\nenvironment.\n The tonal quality and the rendering of the nests made the work appear\n\nto be extremely realistic.\n An additional point of interest was that the unframed work was not\n\nflat but curved outwards toward the sides with zigzag, roughly finished\n\nedges.\n This evoked a great sense of freedom while, at the same time, the\n\ncurve added depth and fostered a sense of security. \n\n  Social concerns were unearthed and solutions put forward by\n\nMakandal ( Douglas Wallace), African ( Robert Cookhorne), and Stanford\n\nWatson.\n Brothers From Across The Sea.\n\nHaiti We Love You  , was timely since in 1992 several Haitian refugees\n\nlanded on Jamaican shores arousing much controversy as to whether or not they\n\nshould be allowed to stay in the island.\n\n\n  Makandal, on the other hand, showed a more global concern and\n\ntook a more cynical look at what seems to be the crumbling of irreparable\n\nsystems and at the focus on Columbian appraisals in his assemblages \n\nNotes Towards The New World Order/Humpy Dumpy  and  Notes Towards\n\nThe New World Order/Columbian  . \n\n  African's twelve panels, in mixed media and collage on paper,\n\nportray the evolution of a social creation within a firmament in which images\n\nseem to be more representational in the first few pieces.\n As the panels progress, the forms become less recognizable.\n Each painting has as its focal point a horizon which separates the\n\nfirmament from a textured area symbolizing earth.\n Some of the panels have an ocean below this horizon and forms looking\n\nlike ships, maybe those of Columbus, sailing the seas.\n Was\n\nScaped. How The Next World Must Be Scaped  .\n Such neoexpressionist works, especially those of Makandal, have\n\nslipped into the realm of the  'Trans-avantgarde'  going, as\n\nthey do, beyond the conventional ideas of avant-gardism.\n It is interesting to note that these three artists, Makandal, African\n\nand Stanford Watson, graduated from    the  \n\nEdna Manley School for the Visual Arts in 1983, along with others such as\n\nTehuti Ra ( Valentine Fairclough, who is not in this show).\n Their works portray a social consciousness which defends and\n\nhighlights the cause of the oppressed.\n It would be interesting to explore the social climate and influences\n\nduring their Art School years and also trace the factors outside their formal\n\neducation which could have generated this consciousness. \n\n  Andrew Jefferson explored the very contemporary dance hall\n\nculture in his pieces  Dance Hall in Session  and  Dance Hall\n\nCouple  .\n The latter depicts the gaudiness in clothing, accessories, and\n\nhairstyles which characterize dance hall attire. \n\n  Not to be outdone in the recording of local culture, Michael\n\nParchment did a series painting of a West Indian cricket match.\n , suggests some\n\nkind of international affair but the subject is a   cricket match in a very mountainous, rural area of\n\nthe Caribbean.\n Here the cricketers are making the best use of the terrain; even the\n\ncricket pitch curves with the hill and one wonders how difficult it would be\n\nto be out by a stumped wicket.\n\n\n  Perhaps secondary to the variety of themes in this 1992 show was\n\nthe exploration of a variety of styles and techniques.\n\n\nments, mainly among the more mature artists.\n Barrington Watson's realist female nude by a waterfall is very\n\nclassical in form and technique while the colours chosen and the scenery are\n\ncompletely tropical.\n The splendid cascade of water pouring over the rocks provides an\n\nideal setting for the young woman standing contemplatively before it.\n One of Watson's strengths is his skill in capturing transparency, as\n\nhe does here in the folds of the fabric tied around the young woman's hips.\n His sensitivity to realism is seen in his mastery of chiaroscuro and\n\nthe strong contrasts expressed in the solidity of the rocks and the form of\n\nthe woman against the fleeting atmospheric light. \n\n  The classical sculptural counterpart to Barrington Watson's\n\npainting is Kay Sullivan's  Paul  .\n This 187 cm bronze resin epitomizes classical Greek order in terms of\n\nperfection in proportion and physical structure of the human anatomy. \n\n \n\nDavid Boxer and Colin Garland and newcomers Roberta Lee Stoddard and Andrea\n\nHaynes-Peart were exciting, thought-provoking and mysterious as works of\n\nthis nature often are.\n had a deep\n\nfeeling of sensuousness and flirted with female sexuality.\n The triangular arrangement of objects and the erotic representation\n\nof the firm breasts and the opened ackees suggested no deflowering but\n\ninstead generates an air of new-found independence and freedom to consent\n\nstill shrouded in a mask-like existence.\n This conglomeration of objects is placed amid dominoes.\n The association of sexual encounter with money is expressed in the\n\nUSA twenty-dollar bill hoisted like a flag.\n Stoddart is a young artist to watch as she has already laid a very\n\nsolid foundation in the art world. \n\n  Movements\n\nNo. 9  , had an interesting interplay of colour.\n and\n\nwriting  Home ( Whitsun)  captured the feeling of nostalgia and\n\nmystique which often surrounds Easter.\n The lavish use of red, white and blue suggests overseas mail and also\n\nthe British flag.\n This could reflect his conscious or unconscious longing for his\n\nhomeland, England. \n\n  Parody lies in the work of Gloria Escoffery as she gives life to\n\nthe  'roots men'  in  Roots Man Psyche I and II  .\n Escoffery was working from a set of carvings from tree roots made by\n\nJoseph, a son of Brother Everald Brown.\n Brother Joseph sees people in these roots and as he carves, he gives\n\ncharacter to these little men.\n Gloria Escoffery has the largest collection of Brother Joseph's roots\n\nmen and creates theatrical tableaux by arranging and rearranging them.\n Her works of this nature can be classified with those of the pattern\n\npainters as they are framed in patterned borders which seem almost unrelated.\n\n\n\n  Assemblages of different forms, relief and three dimensional, are\n\nnow gaining as much attention as mixed-media works.\n\n\npost ( New Messages)  , ( 457 cm) was magnificent.\n It seemed to encapsulate and express the totemic spirituality she had\n\nbeen transmitting to other works in the last two or three years.\n Like those, this assemblage was created from weathered wood, scrap\n\nmetals and other discarded materials. \n\n  The formal elements of colour and texture were outstanding in a\n\ngreat number of pieces.\n The textural quality of the works of artists such as Hope Brooks,\n\nMargaret Chen, Rachel Fearing, Judith Salmon, Cecil Cooper, Petrona\n\nMorrison, and Karl  'Jerry'  Craig was very exciting.\n In some cases, the execution or selection of materials was so\n\neffective that the subject matter and message became almost secondary. \n\n  Master of colour compositions, George Rodney, outdid himself in\n\nthe vibrant abstract expressionist colour compositions,  Elevated Props\n\n and  Midmorning Light and Tangerine  .\n His skill in using acrylic paint to capture light on canvas\n\nilluminated the works while the interplay of the tonal value of the colours\n\ngave them depth and movement. \n\n  The ceramic pieces by Gene Pearson, Norma Rodney-Harrack and\n\nmaster potter Cecil Baugh were of their usual high standard.\n The polychromed earthenware pieces by Londale Campbell were\n\nprovocative.\n Campbell has successfully added another dimension to the use of clay,\n\ndirecting it away from the functional and moving it into the realms of\n\nsculptural form, reflecting social and cultural happenings and concerns. \n\n  Family values were ably addressed in this exhibition by\n\nChristopher Gonzalez in his  Mada and Dawtas  .\n This hammered copper relief has a duality of purpose as it can\n\nbe interpreted as a Jamaican expression of the Madonna and Child theme and\n\n <- > aslo   also   be seen to indicate family\n\nrelationships. \n\n  The works of the intuitives, Everald Brown, Leonard Daley,\n\nWilliam  'Woody'  Joseph, Ras Dizzy ( Birth Livingstone),\n\nMichael Parchment, Paul Perkins, Joseph Richards and Vernon ( Israel)\n\nWilliams, conformed to the styles and themes to which they are accustomed and\n\nfor which they are known.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a1b50de3-92d1-4778-a416-322de6b9290a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.381851+00:00', 'english_score':

{'text': "Sevilla la Nueva, sometimes referred to as Sevilla de Oro, is\n\nsituated in the parish of St Ann, Jamaica.\n The Amerinidian village of Maima, a Taino Arawak settlement, was\n\nonce on this site.\n It was here that Christopher Columbus on his fourth and last voyage\n\nspent one year, June 1503 to June 1504, stranded on the island with his two\n\nworm- eaten ships; beached on the north coast of Jamaica which he had claimed\n\nfor his family and which his son, Diego, asserted was without dispute indeed\n\nhis father's  'discovery'  .  \n\n \n\nment of Seville was started by Juan de Esquivel, who had been appointed\n\ngovernor by the Columbus family.\n Here, in 1509, a town was laid out.\n 'the fairest island\n\neyes have beheld'  , it is not surprising that those who desired to\n\nbuild the town of Seville wished it also to be the fairest town eyes had\n\nbeheld. \n\n  The layout for Seville, the third Spanish town founded in the\n\n 'New World'  , was similar to that of the two earlier towns,\n\nSanto Domingo in Hispaniola and Caparra in Puerto Rico.\n They were all built on the pattern of the Royal grid plan first laid\n\ndown for Santa Fe in Spain, the town built outside Granada by  'Los\n\nReyes Catolicos'  during their siege of the last Islamic region of\n\nSpain. \n\n  On the Seville property was the quarry which supplied the stone\n\nfor the building of this town.\n 'close adjoining to the\n\nspot where Seville once stood is a fine white free-stone, which is soft when\n\nfirst dug up but hardens after exposure.\n Here was plenty of excellent material for architecture.'\n\n\n 'seen some plaster which could\n\nscarcely be broken with an hammer'  .

( 3)Interview:\n\nRitchie/Curtin, Kingston, Jamaica. 1989. \n He recalled how he and his father, the Administrator General of\n\nJamaica at the time, travelled from Kingston, eager to see the precious find.\n Both father and son were aware that an event of historic significance\n\nhad taken place.\n He recalls seeing the pieces of masonry, wrapped in crocus bag (\n\nburlap) lying in the pimento storehouse of the great house; they were being\n\nsprinkled constantly with water to keep them moist, since they had for\n\ncenturies been in water in the well.\n Were they stored or dumped?\n And when did this take place?\n Were they put there for safekeeping when the settlement was\n\nabandoned by the Spanish in the mid-1530s?\n Or were they dumped after 1655, when the English had seized the\n\nisland?\n Did an irate Captain Hemming, anxious to plant sugar cane on his new\n\nplantation ( for which he had been granted a patent in 1674) throw them\n\ninto the well?\n These questions still remain unanswered but archaeological work may\n\nyet give us the clues when other wells are discovered and excavated.\n In late 1989 men doing road work on the verge of the public highway\n\nwhich bisects the property chanced upon one such well. \n\n \n\n  Who were the people who built this town?\n Francisco de Garay, who assumed the office of Governor of Jamaica on\n\nbehalf of the Spanish Crown in 1515, was an important pioneer. \n\n  An excellent administrator, he established farms and ranches in\n\nthe island which, in turn, attracted more settlers to Jamaica.\n Charles I ( Emperor Charles V) made him responsible for the\n\nconversion and good treatment of  'the Indians'  in his\n\ncharge.\n Eventually, hopes of reaching the American mainland lured this Basque\n\nadventurer from the island.\n A rival of Cortes, he died in Mexico in 1523.\n The carving of a coat of arms shown in figure 8 is reminiscent of a\n\nsimpler one in the Basque region of Spain, where the name  de Garay \n\nis to be found.\n It shows a tree, a wolf and a castle.\n Was this stone piece part of the castle in which we know Garay lived\n\nbefore leaving for the mainland?\n Another builder, Juan de Mendegurren, succeeded Francisco de Garay as\n\ngovernor. \n\n \n\n  We are aware of the presence of the Franciscan order at Seville\n\nduring the period of early settlement but what of the Jeronomites?

Chicago: Loyola University Press, 1988. pp\n\n36-38 \n There appears to have been a strong Jeronimite connection with both\n\nFigueroa and Peter Martyr.\n\n\n  Don Pedro Martyr who was born in 1457 at Arona, near Anghiera,\n\nItaly, appears to have been the most influential of these four men.\n In 1489 he went to the University of Salamanca, Spain, by special\n\ninvitation.\n Later he was to go to the Spanish court where he taught nobles and\n\nprominent Spanish citizens.\n He became the official Chronicler in 1511, having access to all\n\ndocuments which passed through the powerful Council of the Indies.\n It should also be remembered that Abbot Peter Martyr was personally\n\nacquainted with Christopher Columbus.\n , there was no one\n\nto equal him in humanistic studies and knowledge of the Indies.\n In fact, his appointment to the Abbacy of Jamaica in 1524 indicated\n\nthat Jamaica ranked high in the eyes of both Spain and Rome.   ( 7) Ibid pp 35-36.  \n\n  The career of Peter Martyr, Abbot of Jamaica, coincides with the\n\nflowering of late Gothic art in Spain, his adopted country, and it is\n\ntherefore essential for us to look briefly at art in the Spain of Peter\n\nMartyr. \n\n \n\n  estile florido\n\n ) reached its zenith in that kingdom in the late fifteenth century.\n The splendour of decorative elements now outweighed the architectural\n\nelements and was expressed in a style called  plateresque  ( meaning\n\nsilversmith-like) which was often extravagant and florid, conveying great\n\nanimation and energy.   \n\n  During this period, innumerable foreign artists were finding\n\nemployment in Spain.\n The leading ones came from the Netherlands, and among those ingenious\n\ncraftsmen was Gil de Siloe.\n There were artists who were sufficiently talented to be able to solve\n\nany task in a truly creative manner.\n The Spanish environment, however, with its strong tinge of Moorish\n\nculture, had in turn an immense influence on these foreigners whose work now\n\nreflected certain features of Spanish art.   (\n\n8)Matejech, Antonin.  Art and Architecture in Europe  . Batchworth\n\nPress, London: 1960.  \n\n  Sculpture flourished under this decorative dominance.\n Commissions for portals, choir benches, tombstones, and other pieces\n\nattracted stone masons and wood carvers who introduced every conceivable\n\nvariation of style into their work.\n Shortly before 1520, great national artists, who have sometimes been\n\nreferred to as the Spanish Eagles, emerged: among the foremost were Bartolome\n\nOrdonez and Diego de Siloe ( believed to be the son of Gil de Siloe). \n\n  Ordonez's early death robbed the Spanish Renaissance of a great\n\ntalent but his association with the younger sculptor Diego de Siloe of Burgos\n\nwho had done his apprenticeship in Florence, meant that there was yet another\n\nSpanish artist who could express space and compose with clarity and force.\n In San Miguel at Onate, Guipuzcoa, is a large monument commissioned\n\nby the Bishop of Granada.\n At the Cathedral of Granada, Siloe's main sculptural works are four\n\nportals done in the 1530s.\n ( 1537).\n Faith and Justice are amid the artist's usual motifs - grotesque\n\nfriezes and panels enlivened by monsters, nude athletes, sprouting bird and\n\nflower forms.\n Although this distinguished architect and sculptor travelled to many\n\ncities in Spain where he was much in demand, it is in Granada that Siloe did\n\nmost of his work and where his influence was felt well into the seventeenth\n\ncentury.\n ( 9)\n\n  ( 9)Kubler, George and Soria, Martini,  Art and\n\nArchitecture in Spain and Portugal and their American Dominions 1500-1800.\n\n London: Penguin Books, pp. 1-42. 1959. \n\n \n\n  In this artistic atmosphere, it is not surprising that Abbot\n\nPeter Martyr would wish that the most beautiful church should be his own in\n\nSeville in Jamaica.\n His church would rival any church in Europe.\n Construction began in 1524.\n By 1526 it was well on its way but in October of that year, Peter\n\nMartyr died. \n\n  Upon the death of Martyr, a disgruntled and troublesome official\n\nby the name of Pedro Mazuelo disrupted the building of the church; although\n\nCharles I gave instructions that the work should continue, complaints in 1533\n\nthat the stone church was unfinished support Sloane's observation that the\n\nchurch was never completed. \n\n  Judging from what both Sloane and Long have told us, several\n\nfragments of carved work in stone such as mouldings, festoons and cherubs\n\nthat were intended for the unfinished church  'would be thought no\n\nmean ornaments in a European church'  .\n Long mentioned the ruins of two buildings still standing in 1774: a\n\ncastle and a church.\n Both had walls several feet thick and were cemented with a hard\n\nsubstance made into lime from  'shell marble'  .\n 'Over\n\nthe door, in the centre, is our Saviour's head with a crown of thorns between\n\ntwo angels, on the right side a small, round figure of some saint, the left,\n\na madonna, her arm tied in three places, after the Spanish fashion.' \n\n  ( 10)  New Seville  p.10 \n\n\n\n  More than fifty years ago, in 1942, Casserly told the Spanish\n\nhistorian Diego Angulo I&ntilde;&iacute;guez who visited the church site\n\nafter its destruction ( it was dynamited in the 1940s) that it had six\n\nbuttresses and the chapel had been five-sided.\n From this description, Angulo I&ntilde;&iacute;guez came to the\n\nconclusion that it was of Gothic design and would have been an exceptional\n\nbuilding in the Caribbean.\n It would have indeed been worthy of its outstanding absentee abbot\n\nhad it been finished before his death. \n\n \n\n  But who were the men who with stone and mortar attempted to make\n\nthe dream of absentee abbots such as Martyr a reality?\n Still to emerge from the shadowy story of the Spanish acquisition of\n\nthe Taino Arawak site of Maima, are two men about whom in-depth research must\n\nnow be carried out: Juan de Mendegurren, the governor mentioned previously,\n\nand Juan de Medina, a Taino Arawak  ca&ccedille;ique  who became the\n\ncarver responsible for a group of Arawak carvers trained in the island of\n\nJamaica itself.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a9028b1e-e7fe-49ef-8645-b7b792e8f4be', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.383274+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9782410860061646, 'non_english_score': 0.02175891399383545}
{'text': "The 1990 Annual National Exhibition at the National Gallery\n\nof Jamaica brought together just over a hundred works by seventy-two artists\n\nto present a fair cross- section of work done last year by Jamaican artists\n\nand artists from overseas who have lived and worked here.  \n\n  Although the absence of our major artists was regrettably evident,\n\nthe Exhibition showed some of the extraordinary artistic energy still surging\n\nin Jamaica.\n As might be expected from seventy-two searching individualists, the\n\nexhibits varied in concept, technique and style.\n The three main media used - Painting, Sculpture and Ceramics - were\n\nvehicles to convey social satire; penetrations into death, despair or the\n\nsubconscious; environmental protest; and other aspects of Nature and\n\nhumanity.\n All the works show facets of society and its environs reflected by the\n\nartists, but only after they have passed through the alembic of the\n\nindividual mind and have been coloured and shaped by it. \n\n  In this assessment of some aspects of the Exhibition, works have\n\nbeen grouped according to theme rather than medium not only because most were\n\npaintings but also because Sculpture and Ceramics were underrepresented.\n Works from five of these themes have been selected for commentary:\n\nthe human head;

{'text': "by Patricia Bryan\n\n  \n\n  The Edna Manley Retrospective Exhibition recently mounted at\n\nthe National Gallery was a remarkable curatorial achievement being, as it\n\nwas, a sensitively orchestrated production.\n Curator David Boxer manipulated what could elsewhere be regarded as on\n\noverly didactic format ( a chronological approach with a supplementary\n\ndocumentary exhibition) and created an informative yet aesthetically\n\nstimulating presentation.\n The show was further given substance firstly by the simultaneous\n\nlaunching of  Edna Manley: Sculptor  written by Dr Boxer and\n\nsecondly by the recent publication of the author's diaries.\n Both publications offer insights into the artist's inner self and the\n\ncontext in which many of the works were created.\n David Boxer's book requires separate discussion but it is a full\n\nappreciation of the exhibition.    \n\n  All that, however, is augmentary not compensatory, for the work\n\nundeniably speaks for itself.\n This exhibition was best viewed alone - there in the solitude of the\n\nconfidential spaces the viewer could have a deeper level of communication\n\nwith work which in many cases compelled the viewer to intimacy. \n\n  The exhibition offered the opportunity to survey the development\n\nover seven decades of the artist's  oeuvre  . \n\n  As an art student, Manley had, it appears, been influenced by the\n\nRomantics but by the time she arrived in Jamaica she had completely modified\n\nher orientation and turned instead to modernism to answer her quest for a\n\nhumanistic art.\n Now symbolism and cubism were her allies, idioms which she approached\n\nwith mastery and sophistication (  Beadseller  1922). \n\n  the\n\n  the   artist's own analysis of African sculpture.\n ( 1924)\n\nthe block format and rigid frontality recalled not only early Egyptian\n\nsculpture but also such sub-Saharan prototypes as the Kuba N'Dop figures.\n The artist's constant searching led her to unify the planarity of\n\ncubism with the neo-classical rotundity of form to create such works as \n\nSeventeen  ( 1932) and  Sixteen  ( 1932).\n This modification of style coincided with the introduction of stone\n\nas a medium.\n Henceforth texture begins to play an important role in Manley's work,\n\ninspired perhaps by the natural quality of the Portland stone (  Beulah\n\n 1933).\n This textual concern transferred itself to all media; at times in\n\nheavily grained wood the natural woodgrain was effectively utilized for\n\naesthetic grain (  Youth  1938;  Negro Aroused  1935).\n At other times chisel marks became an important illusionistic device,\n\ncreating areas of light and shadow on works in stone,   wood and metal.\n ( 1938) this technique was used to express the\n\nvibratory motion of the sawing activity. \n\n  The artist returned time and again to texture for expressive\n\nintent; from the  Father, Forgive Them  and  Fiery Furnace \n\nof the politically turbulent 1940s to the mourning works dealing with the\n\ndeath of her husband as in  Phoenix  and  Woman  ( 1971).\n\n\n  Manley's work is particularly interesting to assess\n\nchronologically for in spite of stylistic changes there are the seemingly\n\ncompulsive themes to which she repeatedly returned; the themes of Woman, male\n\n/ female relationships, social / political concepts, allegorical explorations\n\nof the life cycle.\n What is even more remarkable is how intricately all these relate to\n\neach other, to the artist, and to history. \n\n  The resilience of woman intrigued her at first, perhaps\n\nbecause of the strength of her mother, but certainly later because of the\n\nmonumentality of the Jamaican woman.\n shows this monumental perception of\n\nwoman.\n could not be\n\nincluded in the exhibition.\n ( 1935) and\n\n Market Women  ( 1936) woman is seen as the burden bearer.\n Hills of\n\nPapine  ( 1949), serving both an embracing and protecting function. \n\n  ( 1963) is\n\ndifferentiated by its scale from the intensity of communication between\n\nwomen with a purpose  The Message  ( 1977).\n Painful images of woman's role in the Jamaican matriarchy emerge in\n\n Mountain Women  ( 1971)  Ancestor  ( 1978) and  Ghetto\n\n ( 1981).\n\n\npain, presaged by the  Grief of Mary  in 1968.\n ( 1974) is her own grief.\n ( 1971) writhes with emotional agony.\n None of the women represented in the 70s are happy.\n ( 1979) is withdrawn, almost catatonic.\n ( 1981) that we see an awakening from\n\nthe depression and later, in 1983,  Praise  , with arms and eyes\n\nfocused upward gives hope for a more joyful future.\n ( 1986) speaks really of rebirth, water\n\ncleansing and rejuvenating the soul, and woman re-emerges - invincible. \n\n  It may be somewhat of a contradiction that an artist who would\n\ncreate such a feministic view of woman could also render a profoundly\n\nsensitive development of the Man / Woman relationship.\n However, closer examination shows that this latter theme, based\n\nlargely as it was on her own relationship with her husband, explored a wide\n\nrange of emotions and experiences. \n\n  (\n\n1930) echoes the strain being experienced at that time of her own marriage.\n a reversal of the allegory makes Woman\n\nearth dominant and Man sun submissive.\n These early problems resolve themselves and the images change.\n\n\nOnly the Brave  ( 1960) and  Adios  ( 1971) project an image of\n\na couple united, looking forward together, sharing tenderness.\n It is instructive that in the grief of losing her husband she turns\n\nagain to woman, the protector  Angel  ( 1970), to whom she entrusts\n\nthe transition of the soul of her beloved Norman.\n , represented in the show by maquette and\n\nphotograph, is a moving testament to their closeness. \n\n  The social-political theme gained expression in at least two\n\ndifferent stylistic modes.\n There are the works which speak of conditions among the masses then\n\nthere   are the works reflecting the\n\nleadership of the nationalistic struggle.\n In the first instance, the artist functions as an outsider observer\n\nof conditions which, while drawing her emphatic reaction, do not necessarily\n\nimpact on her life very immediately.\n Thus she was able to create poetic expressions using fluid curves and\n\nrepetition of form as in  Negro Aroused, Diggers  ( 1936), \n\nMarket Women  , and  Sawyers  .\n On the other hand, works which address political issues at leadership\n\nlevel and which must necessarily have affected her personally, connected as\n\nshe was to the two main protagonists, are highly expressionistic almost\n\nviolent.\n , all\n\nfrom 1940, show plainly the artist's distress pertaining to the conflicts\n\nbetween her husband and his cousin Bustamante.\n The riotous textures of these surfaces echo the artist's disquiet.\n Ghetto Mother\n\n ( 1981) she conjured up emotive images of shame but these are images\n\nlacking the intensity of the works from 1940. \n\n  Those who knew Edna Manley will tell you that she was a warm,\n\ngentle, caring person.\n More than that of any other artist, her work chronicles the struggle\n\nfor nationhood in Jamaica.\n is the accepted symbol of that struggle.\n These factors may be inclined to influence a romanticizing tendency\n\non the part of the viewer.\n This should not however blind one to the reality that her version of\n\nthat struggle is carefully edited.\n Edna Manley must have very early been aware that she and her art were\n\npart of history in the making.\n Entries in her diary have a self-conscious quality which seems to\n\nanticipate publication.\n She was, after all, the wife of one National Leader and mother of\n\nanother.\n\n\nphotograph   her art.\n Even when she was driven in the 1940 works to exorcise demons\n\nhaunting her about antagonism between her husband and his cousin Bustamante,\n\nshe carefully disguised this under biblical metaphor.\n\n\nCain and Abel  ) .\n When her husband's political reputation was challenged, she again\n\nturned to the Bible to answer his critics with  The Fiery Furnace \n\nand  Father Forgive Them  .\n Only her technique betrays her rage.\n The artist manages to subtly manipulate those who view her works in\n\ntheir perception of Norman, the great horse riding the winds the morning,\n\ncoming to save the  Dispossessed  from  Hunger  ( 1940).\n It is no coincidence that the rising sun symbol featured in so many\n\nof her works became the symbol of her husband's political party. \n\n  During the difficult decade of the 1970s, her support lay solidly\n\nbehind her much berated prime minister son.\n ( 1978) shows the male child within the\n\nprotective arms of her female ancestor.\n Her only lapse from her apparent policy of protection is the heroic\n\n Ghetto Mother  whose massive arms seek to protect her children from\n\nthe terror of violence.\n It seems that Edna Manley's response to the frightening social\n\nconditions of the time could have been inspired by Bob Marley's music.\n ( 1980) was influenced\n\nby Marley's  'Redemption Song'  .\n This explains, perhaps, the change in treatment from the very formal\n\nand rather sterile  Brother Man  to this much more expressive image\n\nof Rastafari.\n\n\nGhetto Mother  ; social conscience and awareness had never been so high.\n\n\nphotograph     caption \n\n  After these works the show turned dramatically away from\n\npolitical expression to seek balm in dancers, musicians and myths.\n ( 1982) could be\n\ninterpreted as an act of self-mortification. \n\n  In the final gallery, which showed works from the artist's last\n\nyears, her preoccupation with the life cycle was clearly seen.\n This is a theme which was visited with various renditions of the\n\nday/night, sun/moon motif throughout the show.\n revisited signalled a new beginning and all\n\nsubsequent works were ritualistically preparatory for that new beginning.\n The artist drew upon historical prototypes to define this new birth.\n\n\n  is a most appropriate image on\n\nwhich to end the discussion of an artist whose life and art were haunted by\n\nsymbolism from her birth on the 29 February 1900 to the closing of her cycle\n\nwhich found her labouring on a work which spoke of    resurrection   and the hope of eternal life. \n\n \n\n  Kingston:\n\nNational Gallery of Jamaica and the Edna Manley Foundation, 1990. \n\n \n\nKingston: Heinemann Publishers ( Carribean) Ltd, 1989

{'text': 'In a very real sense, the fact that Norman Manley first\n\nattracted wide attention in Jamaica as a sporting hero had a great deal to do\n\nwith his entry into public life, a public life which culminated, after his\n\ndeath, in his elevation to the Order of National Hero in September, 1969.\n\n \n\n  No one should pretend that it was not Norman Manley\'s great\n\nintellect which was to serve as his chief recommendation from his very\n\nearly days.\n However, there can be little doubt that but for his great sporting\n\nprowess he might not have secured the Rhodes Scholarship which took him to\n\nOxford and the study of law. \n\n  As we celebrate Norman Manley\'s centenary, it is fitting for us to\n\nbe aware that the wide recognition of his sporting prowess coincided with the\n\nfirst three years of the Inter-Secondary Schools Championship Sports, known\n\nover the years as Championships, Champs,  Championships and now\n\n Champs.\n The first of these events was in the year 1910, which was also\n\nManley\'s first year in Class 1, the senior class, where any marked success\n\nwas sure to attract attention. \n\n  In those early days, only six schools entered the championships.\n Those institutions were Wolmer\'s Boys, the first winners and one of\n\nthe oldest schools in the island, Manley\'s Jamaica College, St George\'s\n\nCollege and Potsdam School, all of which are still very much with us.\n Potsdam was the original name of what is now Munro College.\n After the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, German names\n\nbecame highly unpopular in Britain and the colonies, and so the Germanic\n\n" \'Potsdam\' " was changed to the acceptable " \'Munro\'\n\n"  .\n\n  The best summary of Manley\'s schoolboy career in track and field\n\nathletics still remains that of the late Sir Herbert Macdonald in the\n\nForeword to his  History of the Inter-Secondary Schools Championship\n\nSports - Champs 1910-1970  , a rare but indispensable volume.\n Sir Herbert, a man who knew a thing or two about sport, wrote of\n\nManley:  \'He was the first schoolboy in Jamaica to take training\n\nseriously  ( and do note that Macdonald did not write  \'to be\n\ntrained seriously\'  )\n He took unto himself the job of imposing discipline into the\n\nathletic life of the College.\n He ordered all boarders to run two laps before breakfast each\n\nmorning.\n He stood at the top of the steps with a strap and corked every boy\n\nwho disobeyed his order.\'  \n\n  Even if that account contains some hyperbole, it is clear that\n\ncertain aspects of the schoolboy sporting leader prefigured certain\n\naspects of the national professional, social and political leader - social\n\nencompassing both sports and the arts. \n\n  In his Norman Manley Memorial Lecture in 1986, the Hon. Viv Blake\n\ntold a nice story which illustrates Manley\'s speed, athleticism and\n\ndiscipline.\n\n\n  Manley\'s contemporaries record the fact that as Captain\n\nof the Jamaica College cricket eleven that was competing for the Sunlight\n\nCricket Cup, it dawned on him that the team was not likely to succeed without\n\nthe assistance of at least one good fast bowler.\n After a futile search for such talent in the upper school, he decided\n\nthat he had to do the job himself.\n He had the speed and stride for the run up to the wicket so as to\n\ncreate the necessary momentum for the delivery, and soon mastered the art of\n\nbowling the inswinger, the away-swinger and the yorker.\n It is said that he even learnt to bowl the occasional bouncer.\n After six weeks of intensive practice, carried out in the early\n\nmorning hours before the boarders at Jamaica College had shaken off their\n\nslumbers, he was satisfied that he was capable of becoming a devastating\n\nopening bowler.\n And his commitment and efforts were rewarded.\n That season, he was the most successful fast bowler in Sunlight Cup\n\ncricket, and Jamaica College duly won the competition.  \n\n  Sir Herbert Macdonald provides the best summary of Manley\'s\n\nschoolboy efforts - some of which are worthy of close examination.\n \'For the three years he ran in Class 1 for Jamaica College,\n\nthis is his remarkable record which has never been equalled and never can\n\nbe.\' \n These words were first published twenty-two years ago and no doubt\n\nwere written before that time.\n They remain as true as ever.\n \'never can be\'\n\n , but they are true.\n First of all, there are now some restrictions in the rules about the\n\nnumber and combination of individual and relay events that an athlete can run\n\n( and one must remember that during Manley\'s time there were no relay events.\n Had there been, then his record would probably have been even more\n\nremarkable.)\n The other thing is that today, whatever the rules might be, a\n\nvaluable athletic  \'property\'  like Manley - especially in\n\nClass 1 - would never be worked as he was then.\n\n\n  He ( Manley) took part in seventeen events ( over three\n\nyears). He won twelve of these. \n\n \n\n \n\n  He won the Class 1 ( individual) Championships for three years in\n\na row, 1910: 11 points, 1911: 17 points, 1912: 18 points.  \n\n  In the last two of the three years, the Jamaica College team won\n\nthe overall event with 35 points in 1911 and 33 points in 1912.\n Manley thus scored very nearly 50% of the points in the first year\n\nand rather more than 50% of the points in the second. \n\n  The details make fascinating reading.\n In 1910 Manley finished second in the 100 yards to J M ( later Dr\n\n \'Fire\'  Hall), the father of the well-known television and\n\nradio personality, Dennis Hall.\n He then finished with three more seconds: in the 440 and Open 880\n\nevents to M O Marsh, and in the Long Jump to J R Lewis.\n His sole victory was in the 120 yards Hurdles, an event in which he\n\nwas to do well when we went to Oxford.\n This all-round performance in a short sprint, the hundred yards, a\n\nlong sprint, the quarter mile, and a middle distance event, the half mile, as\n\nwell as   his efforts in the Hurdles and a\n\nfield event, the Long Jump, earned him his First Class Championship and made\n\nhim a man to watch. \n\n  Indeed, in the next year there was, in a sense, hardly anything\n\nto watch but Manley.\n He won five events and finished second in one, including his most\n\nfamous performance: 10 seconds in the 100 yards, or what was known in the\n\nMother Country as an even time.\n was for many a year the ambition of any\n\ngood-class adult athlete and here it had been achieved by a schoolboy.\n Manley also won the 220 yards, the 440 yards and the 880 yards as\n\nwell as the 120 yards Hurdles for the second year in a row.\n He was beaten only in the Long Jump by Hall, who had won both the 100\n\nand 220 yards in the previous year.\n Manley\'s 17 points would actually have placed him higher than the\n\nfourth placed school.\n The combined points for Manley and Hall totalled 24, above St\n\nGeorge\'s College with 22 points. \n\n  Manley\'s 100 yards record was to last an incredible 41 years\n\nuntil 1952 when it was beaten by Frank Hall, now a well known housing\n\ndeveloper in Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean.\n Among the athletes who were to equal this record was, interestingly\n\nenough, his older son, Douglas, who accomplished the feat in 1941 while at\n\nMunro College. \n\n  The field in Douglas\'s year was to be extremely interesting.\n The runners included the great athlete, Herb McKenley, who finished\n\nthird, L  \'Coco\'  Brown, who was McKenley\'s Jamaican nemesis\n\nat school and after, and George Prescod, well known in Jamaican cricketing\n\nand football circles.\n S W Seymour James of Jamaica College, later the Librarian at the\n\nUnited Nations, was an injured non-starter. \n\n  Yet it was Norman Manley\'s 220 yards record which really\n\ndemonstrated that he was one of the fastest schoolboys in the world.\n He ran the event in 23 seconds flat.\n Just three years before, over the slightly shorter 200 metres, worth\n\nabout one-tenth of a second less, Robert Kerr of Canada had won the gold\n\nmedal at the London Olympics in 22.6 seconds, or four-tenths of a second\n\nfaster.\n One year later in the Stockholm Olympics, fourth, fifth and sixth\n\nplaces were to be all within eight-tenths of a second of Manley\'s 1911\n\neffort. \n\n  Although his times in the sprints were not as imposing in the\n\n1912 championships, Manley was to win all six events in which he entered.\n His 18 points were one more than those of Potsdam School in fourth\n\nposition.\n\n\nChampionahips   Championships   . \n\n  Manley\'s 1912 victories were in the 100, 220, 440, Hurdles, Long\n\nJump and High Jump.\n In the latter he did not attempt to clear the bar until he was the\n\nonly competitor left and he cleared 5 feet, 7 inches to win.\n Had he failed at the height he would, of course, not have placed at\n\nall.\n Second in this event was Lambert Lewis of St George\'s who was to\n\nbecome famous as one of the best footballers ever produced in Jamaica. \n\n  Manley\'s most remarkable performances were in the Hurdles where\n\nhe ran 14.6 seconds in the heats and 14.8 in the finals.\n It was felt that these extraordinary times indicated that something\n\nwas wrong and that perhaps only nine instead of ten hurdles had been set up.\n However, the height of the hurdles was only three feet, much less\n\nthan the Olympic height of three feet, six inches, therefore no one should be\n\ntoo surprised that an athlete with Manley\'s speed could run faster than the\n\nOlympic times, given the lower height.\n The fact that O J Lecesne\'s time in the other heat was 16 seconds\n\nsuggests that there was not very much wrong. \n\n  So ended Manley\'s schoolboy track and field career.\n It would have been very interesting to see just what he might have\n\ndone if the First World War had not prevented the Berlin Olympics planned for\n\n1916 from being held.\n The times of the 100 and 200 metres winners at Antwerp in 1920\n\nsuggest that he could have been a medal contender.\n Charlie Paddock, the famous American runner, won the 100 in 10.8 and\n\nthe other two medals went in 10.8 and 11 seconds.\n Allen Woodring won the 200 in 22.0 seconds and the other two\n\nmedallists finished at 22.1 and 22.2.\n In the Hurdles, Earl Thomson set a world record at 14.8 followed by\n\n15.1 and 15.2.\n The 110 metres distance was, however, one foot longer than 120 yards.\n\n\n\n  \'Work\n\nand I worked very hard and Sports and I did a bit of everything - Track,\n\nAthletics, Cricket, Football, Rifle Shooting, filled my life.\'  \n\n  It was not fashionable then for Jamaican boys of Manley\'s social\n\nclass and abilities to go to American universities, not even Ivy League ones,\n\nbut one can imagine what he might have done even at an Ivy league school had\n\nhe specialized in Track and Field Athletics.\n He might well have beaten Herb McKenley, as his son was to do in that\n\nfamous 1941 race, as the first English-speaking Caribbean man to secure a\n\ntime or distance-measured world record in sport. \n\n  Twenty years after his schoolboy career had ended, Manley was\n\nstill remembered for his feats by his schoolmates and peers.\n H O A ( Harry) Dayes was one of the few legal men who was thought to\n\nbe worthy of intellectual comparison with Manley and he himself was a\n\nchampion tennis player.\n In 1932 he spoke at the Jamaica College Old Boys dinner when Manley\n\nwas honoured for becoming King\'s Counsel - a very rare distinction in those\n\ndays.\n \'When one went to the sports of J.C., when one\n\nturned the programme, one saw what appeared to be only the name of Manley,\n\nbut on further looking also we saw that he held six of some fifteen records.\n They always regarded him as a demon of speed - a belief still shared\n\nby many of the cops and speed cops on the island.\' \n The aside referred to Manley\'s lifelong reputation as a fast driver.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '9f3c6bd0-3fa3-4050-8e1b-c554543c0392', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.387338+00:00',

{'text': 'Music and dance forms have always been integral elements of a\n\npeople\'s culture and in Jamaica it is no different.\n Through our music and dance we find creative and artistic expressions\n\nof our joys, sorrows, tragedies and triumphs.\n Over the years, our music and dance forms have evolved from the\n\ntraditional forms of our ancestors to their present forms. \n\n  Our music and dance are rich, powerful and vibrant.\n We have gained international acclaim through our many artistes and\n\ndancers such as Bob Marley, Willard White, and the National Dance Theatre\n\nCompany among others.\n These are aspects of Jamaican life of which we can be truly proud.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Mento is the original popular music form in Jamaica, developing\n\nduring the plantation period and holding sway up to the 1950s.\n It was born out of the fusion of African and British influences.\n Its performance mode, rhythmic impulse, as well as its call and\n\nresponse type singing are African in origin, while the scale patterns,\n\nharmonic concepts, verse and chorus song types are British. \n\n  Mento was one of the vehicles by which aspects of life considered\n\ntaboo, were addressed.\n Often done with a touch of humour, the words of the accompanying\n\nsongs addressed our social and economic struggles.\n A mento band could be found in most villages throughout the country.\n\n\n\n  Mento is regarded in some circles as the Jamaican equivalent to\n\ncalypso.\n While some of the songs were aired regularly, others were banned as\n\nthey were thought to be too sexually explicit. \n\n  Mento was first recorded by artistes such as Lord Flea and Lord\n\nFly and later by Harold Richardson and  \'Sugar Belly\'  Walker.\n \'Run Mongoose\', \'Rukumbine\'\n\n  and   \'Peel Head John Crow.\'    \n\n  Today, Mento is played mainly by bands in North Coast hotels and\n\nas accompaniment for dances such as the traditional Quadrille. \n\n \n\n    Quadrille   \n\n  Quadrille originated from the popular dances of the French and\n\nEnglish in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n It highlighted the elegance and mannerisms of the elite of these\n\nsocieties.\n It is however believed that Quadrille began in France, as it was the\n\nleading country in cultural development, especially in the dances of that\n\nperiod. \n\n  Quadrille is performed in four distinct movements, called\n\nfigures.\n figure was later added to the\n\ndance - the Mento. \n\n  The Square and Long Way Set formation of Quadrille was introduced\n\nin the early 19th century.\n However as the dance developed the names were changed to Ballroom\n\nQuadrille and Campstyle. \n\n  The Long Way Set formation ( Campstyle) was performed mostly in\n\nthe rural areas.\n In this dance, four couples stand in two lines facing each other, all\n\nof whom move at the same time. \n\n  The Square Quadrille ( Ballroom) was performed mostly in the\n\ntowns where the elite resided.\n They tried to maintain an atmosphere of elegance and grace as their\n\ncounterparts in their home country.\n In the Ballroom, four couples stand in the cardinal position where\n\nthe head and tail couples move first followed by the side couples. \n\n  Both the Campstyle and Ballroom Quadrille dance we know today\n\ninclude African elements, but this is more evident in the Campstyle version.\n\n\n\n  There are five African features in Campstyle Quadrille.\n " bent\n\nknee"  quality, the  " throw back"  , practice by the\n\nblacks to mimic the whites, the use of the hips and the incorporation of\n\nsteps from other European social dances.   \n\n  Although the Campstyle Quadrille includes African elements, it\n\nstill retains original elements such as Advancing and Retreating, Crossing (\n\npass through), Promenade, Figure of Eight made by Ladies, Star Formation,\n\nGrand Chain, Wheels and Balancing. \n\n  Quadrille was a popular social dance after Emancipation.\n It was performed at tea parties, house openings and family\n\ncelebrations, especially weddings.\n It was also performed at community functions such as the 1st of\n\nAugust celebrations, fairs held by church groups, 4H Club Day celebrations,\n\nBoxing Day and New Year\'s Day celebrations. \n\n  On these occasions, music was provided by Mento Bands, which\n\nplayed a variety of traditional European tunes.\n The instruments included violin, fife, piccolo, saxophone, trombone,\n\nclarinet, trumpet, banjo, guitar, drum, marimba or rhumba, triangles, pieces\n\nof irons, sardine cans, forks or graters or double bass. \n\n  Of particular interest is a bass instrument constructed from a\n\npiece of thick bamboo about 13.13 m ( 4 ft.) long.\n A string which is attached is pulled against a hole as the musician\n\nblows through it.\n Musicians sometimes used improvised instruments made from discarded\n\nmaterial such as pieces of iron and empty sardine tins.\n dress was rustic with headties while the\n\nmen wore bright shirts. \n\n  The popularity of Quadrille declined after the introduction of\n\nAmerican music and calypso in the 1950s.\n Today it is mostly performed as part of the annual Festival\n\ncelebrations. \n\n \n\n  Myal, one of the oldest dances in Jamaica, is associated with a\n\ntype of religious observance.\n This dance was mostly performed in the parish of St. Elizabeth.\n It has also been erroneously associated with Obeah.\n The difference, however, is the belief that while Obeah uses evil\n\npowers, Myal uses good powers. \n\n  Myalists captured the ghosts of dead people in order to use and\n\ncontrol them.\n Myal was declared illegal by the authorities who regarded it as a\n\ngreat evil. \n\n  In the 1840s Myal was revived when missionary activities began to\n\nget stronger.\n It was recorded in the Moravian and Presbyterian records that this\n\naction distressed the ministers. \n\n  The Myal cult is now a relic of the past but elements still\n\nexist.\n The dance shows a wide range of body movements, extensive use of\n\nspace and violence of action.\n These are done by throwing the body on the ground and by acrobatic\n\nfeats, as well as a vibrating movement brought about by a succession of rapid\n\nsideway shifts from foot to foot, on the toes and with knees bent.\n\n\n  Myal ceremonies took place in open fields, or under cotton trees,\n\nand often people would sing, drum and dance all night. \n\n \n\n  The Gumbay dance, an element of the cult of healing of the same\n\nname, was also performed in the parish of St. Elizabeth and is derived from\n\nMyal. \n\n  The dance consists of a series of long steps followed by\n\nvibrating sideways body movements and by wheeling turns and sudden stops with\n\npelvic forward tilt. \n\n  At healing ceremonies, which lasted most of the night, various\n\nfeats such as back bending, rolling over in a succession of somersaults and\n\nclimbing high coconut trees, would take place in the height of possession.\n The square drum was used in this dance.\n\n\n  This dance is also known among some members of the Maroon\n\npopulation. \n\n \n\n  The Ettu dance is performed in the parish of Hanover and is a\n\nsocial dance from Africa.\n It is believed that Ettu is a corruption of the word Edo, the name of\n\na West African Yoruba Tribe. \n\n  The dance involves the lifting and dropping of elbows and\n\nshoulders, with the feet doing a sideways shuffling step. \n\n  The musical instruments consist of a double headed goatskin drum\n\n- the irre and a kerosene tin referred to as the achaka or katta.\n The dance metre is of two types, simple duple and compound duple,\n\nknown as the blues.\n The songs are short and repetitive, built on four notes only and sung\n\nin a Yoruban dialect. \n\n \n\n  The Maypole dance originated in the 15th century and is now the\n\nnational dance of St. Vincent, performed on May 1 ( May Day).\n\n\n  The dance was introduced to the island by slaves and was usually\n\nperformed on May 27, Queen Victoria\'s Birthday. \n\n  Maypole, also referred to as the Long Ribbon Pole in rural areas,\n\nwas a part of outdoor social festivities of old England and Jamaica and was\n\nperformed at fairs, garden parties or picnics.   \n\n  There are various styles in Maypole, more popular being the\n\nSpider Web, Flair, Dome and Umbrella. \n\n  Maypole is still performed in the rural areas at village fairs\n\nand on other celebratory occasions. \n\n \n\n  Dinki Mini originates from the Congolese word " \'ndingi\'\n\n" which means lamentation or funeral song.\n Dinkies are celebratory occasions.\n Although associated with death, the music is lively, joyous and\n\nexciting, intending to cheer the family and friends of the dead person.\n Dinki Mini was practiced openly throughout slavery but is now done\n\nmainly during our annual Festival celebrations. \n\n  However, it is still performed in the parishes of St. Mary, St.\n\nAnn, St. Andrew and Portland, while Gerreh is found in the parishes of\n\nHanover, Westmoreland and St. James.\n Its popularity came about from the death of Tacky, a hero of the\n\nMaroons, as it was performed during his funeral celebrations. \n\n  Popular at set-ups or nine-nights, the first few nights consist\n\nof singing and dancing to mento music.\n The sixth to the eighth night is dominated by ring games, role\n\nplaying, riddles and anancy stories.\n \'mature\'\n\n spirit to begin its journey  \'home\'  , is performed.\n the\n\nspirit by turning over mattresses and rearranging rooms. \n\n  The aim of the ritual is to properly send the spirit on its\n\njourney.\n\n\n  Included in the activities, is the feeding of the dancers and\n\nsingers who will not hesitate to remind the householders of this duty. This\n\nis done in song, for example: \n\n  While refreshment is provided at the set-up, a mini feast is\n\nprepared for the Ninth Night.\n This consists of fried fish, coffee, or chocolate tea, crackers\n\nand bread.\n In some parishes curried goat and rice with mannish water ( i.e.\n\ngoat head soup) is served. \n\n  Instruments associated with the Dinki Mini are shakas, katta\n\nsticks, condensed milk tins, grater, the tamboo ( cylindrical shaped drums)\n\nand the benta.\n The benta is an ancient stringed instrument - a fret board made of\n\nbamboo and a gourd resonator. \n\n  The Dinki Mini dance focuses on the pelvic region, as it is\n\nperformed in defiance of the death that has occurred.\n The dancers, male and female together, make suggestive rotations\n\nwith the pelvis in an attempt to prove that they are stronger than death, as\n\nthey have the means to reproduce. \n\n  The lyrics of the songs associated with Gerreh are also\n\nsuggestive.\n Gerreh however has another dimension - the bamboo dance - that is\n\ndancing on elevated bamboo poles and between four bamboo poles brought\n\ntogether and pulled back by four crouching players. \n\n \n\n  Revivalism began in Jamaica between 1860 and 1861 as part of a\n\nreligious movement called the Great Revival.\n It is a combination of elements from African pagan beliefs and\n\nChristianity and has several forms.\n The two major ones however, are Pocomania & Revival Zion ( Zion).\n\n\n\n  Revivalists believe that the temporal and spiritual worlds are\n\nindivisible, therefore the living can be possessed and influenced by the\n\nspirits of the dead.   \n\n  Once a worshipper is possessed, the spirit becomes his protector\n\nand consultant, in return for food which is usually offered. \n\n  A ritual which involves singing, drumming, dancing, clapping,\n\ngroaning and the use of prayers is done to invite possession.\n Some of the music and songs come from orthodox religion.\n Evidence of possession is wheeling and dancing, falling into a\n\ntrance and speaking in unknown tongues. \n\n  Revival groups or bands have leaders.-\n or\n\n " Captain"  , while the female leader is referred to as\n\n " Mother"  .\n The shepherd or leader controls and uses several spirits.\n As the distinctions between the branches of revivalism become less\n\ndefined and a certain  \'respectability\'  is acquired, leaders\n\nare often referred to as Bishop.\n The group consists of many officers who have titles and specific\n\nfunctions.\n where a\n\ntemporary structure is erected. \n\n  Today bands erect concrete structures.\n is usually a part of the\n\nleader\'s yard and is marked by a tall pole on which a flag is flown.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd826ab55-5202-4142-bc14-b7c48bed3ffe', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.388582+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9779432415962219, 'non_english_score': 0.022056758403778076}
{'text': "The continuity of family life is based upon the transmission of\n\npositive attitudes and values from one generation to the next.\n In Jamaica today, this process of socialization is affected by threats\n\nwhich arise from various sources.\n These threats can result in change affecting not only the physical\n\nwell-being of family members, but also the psychological climate of the home.\n This has implications for the quality of life enjoyed by the family\n\nmembers, the continuity and stability they are able to establish and\n\nmaintain, and the progress of communities and the nation.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  The economic state of the country and the high un-employment\n\nrates of both men and women have reduced the financial support available to\n\nfamilies at a time when the cost of living is rising dramatically.\n External funding arrangements with the World Bank and the\n\nInternational Monetary Fund under the Structural Adjustment Programme have\n\nresulted in a large national debt, and a substantial proportion of\n\nJamaica's exports of goods and services is used to repay this debt.\n In 1989, this proportion was 26.4% compared with 2.8% in 1970.\n The resulting cutbacks in public expenditure have adversely affected\n\nthe availability of social services for the poor.\n Derrick Boyd reporting for the United Nations Children's Fund (\n\nUNICEF) in 1988 indicated a reduction of 44% in real expenditure on\n\neducation, health and social security between 1981-82 and 1985-86.\n Other areas of cutback include transportation, communication,\n\nroads, agriculture and industrial services.\n Many government employees, most of them responsible for households,\n\nhave been laid off their jobs.\n The inflation resulting from a series of currency devaluations\n\nover the past fifteen years has increased the cost of food, fuel, and public\n\nutilities as well as a host of other items.\n Food prices have also risen significantly as a result of the removal\n\nof subsidies. \n\n  The high rate of unemployment among men, particularly in\n\nurban areas, means that, even when willing, they are unable to provide\n\nfinancial support for their families.\n In 1990, the Family Court, which is composed of judicial and social\n\nsections providing family support services to the public, heard 2,690 cases\n\nwhere fathers were being sued for the maintenance of their children.\n The decline in male earning capacity makes it difficult for women to\n\nrely on men \x13 whether their baby-fathers or new sexual partners \x13 for\n\nfinancial support; they have had, therefore, to be more reliant on their own\n\nincome and wages. \n\n  Jamaican women have a high labour force participation rate.\n Among them are many professional women for whom work involves using\n\nskills in which an educational investment has been made, and whose\n\ncapabilities have been developed because of ability, interest, op <l>\n\nportunity and commitment.\n The proportion of women in this category increased from 4% in 1943 to\n\nover 37% in 1984 [ Gordon, 1989].\n A large percentage are in the service professions \x13 nursing and\n\nteaching \x13 which are the lowest paid, but where the working hours allow\n\na measure of flexibility and permit greater involvement in childrearing.\n Many professional women rely on domestic helpers to assume\n\nresponsibility for day- to-day household chores, and child care.\n These helpers come from the large majority of Jamaican working women\n\nwho provide a source of cheap unskilled and semi-skilled labour and who work\n\nin areas which reflect the sexual division of labour \x13 in handicraft, garment\n\nmaking, domestic service, growing and trading in food.\n A number are employed in labour-intensive industries where they do\n\nmonotonous, repetitive tasks for low wages, and where there is limited\n\nopportunity for skill training or promotion.\n Others have become risk takers and have established themselves as\n\nInformal Commercial Importers ( ICIs), traders in consumer goods, who travel\n\nabroad and purchase goods for sale locally.\n\n\n  The work done by women in maintaining the family unit is\n\nessential to the functioning of society and of the economy, yet has little\n\nrecognized economic value, and no legal or social status.\n Hilary Phillips noted in 1987 that a Jamaican wife can make no claim\n\nto the division of matrimonial property if her contribution to the home was\n\nlimited to cooking, cleaning and looking after the children.\n She can only substantiate a claim if her name is on the registered\n\ntitle, if she makes direct financial contribution to the purchase of the\n\nproperty or if she pays some of household expenses.\n Phillips pointed out that this situation differs from that in\n\nBarbados and Trinidad where the wife's non-financial contribution to the\n\nmaintenance of the household is recognized and quantified in the division of\n\nmatrimonial property. \n\n  It has been estimated that 42% of all households in Jamaica are\n\nheaded by women, with the percentage in the Kingston Metropolitan Area rising\n\nto 45%.\n These women are often the only source of financial support for their\n\nfamilies, but they earn lower wages than men, and are more likely to be\n\nunemployed.\n In 1990, the unemployment/job-seeking rate for men was 13.7% while\n\nthat for women was 33.2%. \n\n  In July 1984, the Food Aid Programme was introduced, designed to\n\ncushion the effect of the removal of subsidies on basic food items to the\n\nmost vulnerable in the society: school children, the poor, the needy and the\n\nelderly.\n\n\n  - to maintain existing nutritional levels of persons at risk of\n\nmalnourishment because of changes in purchasing power. \n\n  - to provide minimal nutrition intake levels for persons with no\n\nor little visible income. \n\n  - to improve the nutritional levels of school children through\n\nthe School Feeding Programme. \n\n  Reports suggest that this programme is inadequate in meeting the\n\ndemand which exists among the target groups.\n No significant difference has been found, in participation in the\n\nFood Stamp and School Feeding Programmes, between female-headed households\n\nand male-headed households nor in indicators such as health, nutritional\n\nstatus, and learning progress in school.\n Louat, Grosh and van der Gaag [ 1992] advise targeting rural\n\nhouseholds for social programmes directed at alleviating conditions of the\n\npoor, as such programmes will reach 87% of the poor; targeting female-headed\n\nhouseholds will succeed in reaching only 50% of the poor. \n\n  Coping strategies adopted by poor families involve the one\n\ntraditionally employed by women: use of the kinship network.\n Kinship links allow them to respond to hardship and crises in\n\ncreative ways.\n [ 1990] report household exchange networks\n\nwhich increase the flow of food, services and cash among relatives, friends\n\nand neighbours.\n One example given is that of the exchange of fresh vegetables from\n\nrural relatives for manufactured items such as flashlight batteries from\n\nurban network members.\n 'partner'\n\n savings, and increasing the size of the household by bringing in\n\nadditional income earners and persons who can assist with household chores\n\nand child care, while those who can obtain employment do so. \n\n  Housing is a major problem.\n In urban areas it is unavailable and unaffordable and this results in\n\novercrowding in small, badly-ventilated homes with poor sanitation which\n\nleads to unhealthy personal habits and creates an environment in which\n\ndisease is readily spread.\n D.R.B. Grant [ 1980] reported that children of varying ages, and both\n\nsexes, often sleep together on the same bed because there is no space for\n\nthem to have a bed each.\n\n\n  The Survey of Living Conditions in Jamaica reports a growth in\n\nthe number of households since 1985 of approximately 13,000 per annum.\n This creates a strong potential demand for new housing,\n\nparticularly in urban areas.\n The effective demand is, however, low, for although the need is\n\nthere, the price-to- income ratio is high and is expected to continue rising.\n The housing available is therefore out of reach for most persons in a\n\nwide range of income groups.\n As a result, many families are forced to live in conditions which are\n\ninadequate and uncomfortable. \n\n  The overcrowding and resultant lack of privacy create tired,\n\nfrustrated, anxious adults and children, who also have to endure the\n\nindignities and discomfort of an inadequate transportation system.\n article, Eleanor Wint condemns the conditions\n\nunder which transportation is made available to the public, and the hazards\n\nwhich attend its use, particularly for children.\n\n\n  Many of us have witnessed small girls being handed\n\nthrough a bus window to unknown male arms inside a crowded bus where she is\n\nsqueezed into any available space.\n Or where bus conductors curse children to get up and give their seat\n\nto an adult and go and be squeezed into some space with a bottom in their\n\nface.  \n\n  Daily\n\nGleaner  18.11.1992] \n\n  Such everyday experiences adversely affect the social, emotional\n\nand psychological well being of individuals, and deny family members the\n\nfeeling of security and refuge which are so necessary for healthy interaction\n\nand relationships.\n They also result in large tenement yards and squatter communities.\n In some situations, these function like an extended family but in\n\nothers the conditions encourage truancy and delinquency among children and\n\ngradually lead to criminal activity. \n\n  Most families struggle to provide basic needs for their members\n\nbut there are affluent homes where the family members enjoy luxurious

{'text': "The Jamaican society now stands at a most critical point in its\n\nself- understanding and in the working out of its own future shape, form and\n\nstructure at the most fundamental level.\n In this respect, it is like many other societies which fall into a\n\nsimilar relationship with the larger and dominant centres of Western\n\ncivilization ( Western Europe, the United Kingdom, North America) and which\n\nshare a somewhat similar sociopolitical history and experience and face\n\nsimilar developmental challenges and issues.\n This is evident in nearly every area of Jamaican life \x13 social,\n\npolitical, economic and cultural.\n There is no area, however, in which it is more evident, than in the\n\narea of morality.\n Even though it may not be readily acknowledged, the lack of\n\nacknowledgement itself, which may also represent a lack of interest, is\n\nvery much a part of the critical nature of our present situation. \n\n  In this particular situation, the society appears to be at a point\n\nwhere it is both catching up with and being carried away by the spirit of the\n\ntimes.\n On the one hand it seems to be belatedly coming to terms with what for\n\nsome time was known as the spirit of the modern age, associated with\n\nWestern culture and civilization \x13 and originating in the eighteenth\n\ncentury.\n This represented a new framework of thought and new rational criteria\n\nfor reflecting on life, investigating reality, relating to nature and\n\nmanaging human affairs.\n It meant that previously unchallenged, and presumably\n\nunchallengeable, sources of knowledge and moral authority were brought under\n\nscrutiny and considered, in some instances, to be found wanting.\n A new sense of individual liberty and an awareness of the ability of\n\nhuman beings to think through their problems and provide their own\n\nself-determined and self-sufficient answers became dominant factors in\n\nWestern thought.\n It has taken some time, but now this is a prevailing spirit in our\n\nmidst. \n\n  There are some specific and significant ways in which this spirit\n\nhas manifested itself.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Religion, particularly the Christian religion, has long played a\n\ndominant role in our society.\n It is often claimed that there are more church buildings to the\n\nsquare mile in Jamaica than anywhere else in the world.\n Whether this is a really so or not, it is speaking to a perceived\n\nreligious saturation of the society.\n Continued formal and semi-formal gestures of recognition ( not\n\nnecessarily appreciation) accorded the church and its representatives\n\nseem to testify to the continuity of traditional assumptions of power,\n\nauthority and influence.\n The influence of religion on the day to day speech and vocabulary of\n\nthe people would seem to bespeak widespread religious allegiance. \n\n  The fact of the matter is, however, that the secular option has\n\nbecome very real and the spirit of secularism has been having a very decisive\n\nformative influence on general viewpoints, attitudes and policies of action\n\nthroughout the society. \n\n  The church, a long-standing source and centre of moral authority\n\nand influence, can no longer take for granted that it has any special right\n\nor privilege to be heard and to have its dictates respected and followed.\n No longer does it have the almost universally accepted role of being\n\nthe predominant shaper of the public moral consciousness and chief guardian\n\nof public morality.\n It can no longer simply press for legislation and, codes of conduct\n\nthat presuppose everybody is religious and, more specifically, Christian or\n\naccepting Christian ethical convictions and codes.\n In addition, there are today areas of life, social, cultural and\n\npolitical, in which the church is no longer considered to have the competence\n\nor right to comment on or offer counsel and advice.\n Above all, there is a greater readiness as well as a sense of freedom\n\nto reject outright any religious opposition which is considered to interfere\n\nwith people's individual rights and private lives.\n Whether the issues is gambling, attitudes to holy days and seasons,\n\nforms of entertainment and revelry, the content of popular local music or the\n\nmorality of male-female relationships and the quality of family life, the\n\nchurch's voice of protest and moral instruction no longer bears the\n\nauthoritative significance it once did. \n\n  Frequent vandalism of church property and robbery of churches,\n\nemergent and increasing anti-clericalism and more open questioning and\n\ndismissal of the teachings of the church are recent phenomena that bear out\n\nevidence of a new attitude that does not accord a certain respect and regard\n\nto religion and its representative institutions, persons and traditions.\n Much greater freedom is being displayed, on more than one level, in\n\nrejecting or ignoring religious protests made on presumed moral grounds\n\nagainst certain socioeconomic policies and lifestyle pursuits. \n\n  All of this undoubtedly is part of the general sidelining of the\n\nreligious influence with its strong claims to moral knowledge and authority.\n Whereas opinion polls at the present moment would still show that a\n\nmajority of persons in our society share some form of religious beliefs and\n\nconviction, there is no doubt that the secular spirit is growing. \n\n  So much of the continued acknowledgement the church receives is\n\nmore the relic of a perception of past significance than an appreciation\n\nof current relevance.\n The church is no longer an almost universally accepted source of\n\nmoral authority.\n It has lost its power, and even its confidence, to define and\n\ndominate areas of public debate concerning, among other things, the\n\ncommunity's morals.\n There is now in evidence a falling away from the belief that the\n\nsociety is a Christian society along with the corresponding moral\n\nimplications. \n\n \n\n  The emergence of the secular option and the onset of the spirit\n\nof secularism also mark the growing recognition of the existence of a\n\nmultiplicity of religious perspectives, world views, moral frames of\n\nreference and preferences of lifestyles.\n Not only has the hegemony of mainline Christian denominations been\n\nbroken by a proliferation of other Christian and religious groups, including\n\nour very own home-grown Rastafarianism, but other viewpoints, philosophies,\n\nworld-views \x13 borrowed, copied, adopted and adapted \x13 have become, and are\n\nincreasingly becoming, part of daily life.\n Controversies, disagreements, competing claims, differences,\n\nvariation and variety rather than agreement and consensus, or even dialogue\n\nand conversation, are becoming more and more the order of the day.\n columns in the press,\n\nradio-talk shows,  'Vox Pop'  , sermons, public speeches, and\n\nstreet talk all convey this. \n\n  Indeed, even in terms of the once dominant Christian moral\n\nperspective, obvious internal divisions appear.\n In the recent debate over the reintroduction of a lottery, we\n\nwitnessed one church leader coming out with full page statements in one of\n\nour daily newspapers chiding those Christian groups which opposed the lottery\n\nand expressing the view that, essentially, that should not be the concern of\n\nthe church.  \n by\n\nthe Rev. J. Douglas of the Fellowship Holiness Church. \n One church group dissociated itself from the call of others for\n\nchurch groups and their members to consider curtailing their business or\n\ncease doing business with the Bank of Nova Scotia Jamaica Ltd, which is the\n\ncustodian, wholesaler and retailer of the lottery tickets. \n\n\n 2. Press release issued by the National Executive of the New\n\nTestament Church of God on September 17, 1991, entitled  'The\n\nDenomination's Stand on the Instant Lottery'  . \n There were also constant queries as to the right of the churches to\n\ndictate to people on such a matter.\n It was taken for granted that the church was overstepping its bounds\n\nin seeking to dictate in such an area. \n\n  Both within the ranks of the church and outside, a plurality of\n\nviewpoints manifested itself. This is but a recent dramatic example, but it\n\nreflects what is taking place at several levels, on an ongoing basis.\n It is a growing trend.\n No single voice of morality is recognized as having any absolute\n\nright to dictate proper moral behaviour.\n In this we can see an indication of an abandonment of any universally\n\naccepted source of moral authority.\n The society is becoming one of open options.\n A variety of moral frameworks is being recognized, providing\n\nalternative options for the individual.\n Indeed, there are even some individuals who might not recognize any\n\nof the existing options as the norm, but establish their own.\n\n\n \n\n  There are those who can recall a time when, generally speaking,\n\nmost, if not all, persons accepted or acknowledged the same rules or\n\ncodes of conduct in their society.\n Whether everybody was faithful to them or not, everybody regarded\n\nthem as important and warranting being observed and obeyed.\n There were rules and codes of conduct sanctioned by the traditional\n\ncentres of moral authority, for example, the church, the school and the home,\n\nwhich were themselves, for the most part, mutually supportive in this regard.\n It cannot be said that such a situation obtains today in our society.\n With burgeoning pluralism there is the relativizing of morality and a\n\ncorresponding individualizing of the moral decision making process.\n There is what Mervyn Alleyne regards as a confrontation of cultures,\n\nthe traditional collectivism of the Jamaican culture being met head-on by\n\nEuropean individualism. \n\n  In the case of the latter, emphasis is placed on individuals\n\nbeing responsible for their own personal welfare.\n They should be free from all restraint as long as they remain within\n\nthe constraints of the law and, to a lesser extent, also within the bounds of\n\nmorality.\n The goal of life is the individual's own personal success which\n\ninvariably is achieved mainly at the expense of others.\n Those who do not work to achieve this goal are regarded as lazy and\n\n 'good for nothing'  .\n It is a matter of two world views in which there are different\n\norderings of priorities.  \n Pluto\n\nPress, London. 1988. pp.192-3  \n\n  Increasingly, people feel that they are confronted with a variety\n\nof moral options with no overarching moral consensus or absolute moral\n\nauthority that they are obliged to obey.\n The autonomous self assumes the ascendancy \x13 each person chooses his\n\nor her own moral frame of reference and preference as seen fit.\n There is really no right or wrong lifestyle.\n It is essentially a matter of personal opinion, personal wishes,\n\npersonal likes or dislikes guided by a combination of enlightened reason and\n\nself-interest.\n 'plausibility\n\nstructure'  , that is, a social framework or structure of ideas and\n\npractices that creates the condition determining what beliefs are plausible\n\nwithin the society.  \n , Anchor\n\nPress/Doubleday, Garden City, N.Y: 1979. pp. 7ff. \n And so, whether it is a matter of what one does in terms of business\n\npractices, relationships with others, work-ethic, attitudes to racism,\n\nclassism, sexism, the choice is essentially a matter of individual decision\n\nas to what is considered right or wrong, based on the individual's own freely\n\nformed personal convictions. \n\n  The assumption here is that people should not be brought under\n\nany pressure by the society or any group or groups claiming exclusive moral\n\nknowledge and authority to make choices one way or another.\n It is simply not the business of society how individuals exercise\n\ntheir personal freedom, providing they occasion, no harm to any other. One\n\nperson's choice is just as good as another's sine there is no ultimate\n\nstandard by which judgement may be passed.\n This spirit is well summed up by Milton Friedman who is of the\n\nopinion that ethical decisions should remain firmly in the hands of the\n\nindividual, and that society should not interfere at all.\n 'The really important ethical\n\nproblems are those that face an individual in a free society \x13 what he should\n\ndo with his freedom.'   \n , University\n\nof Chicago Press, 1962. pp. 12ff \n Interestingly it would seem that Friedman's economic ideology, which\n\nembodies this view, is itself very much a part of what is taking shape around\n\nus at this moment. \n\n  There are nostalgic longings for traditional values and vigorous\n\ncalls for a return to such values.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5ccb255b-684a-4ceb-a6ca-c709de9cbdb3', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.391326+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9672116041183472, 'non_english_score': 0.03278839588165283}
{'text': "The dramatic and far-reaching events in Eastern and Western Europe\n\nare of such magnitude and have such considerable implications that they would\n\nhave been enough to keep the world, and Jamaica along with it, fully occupied\n\nfor some time in analysis and speculation in sheer curiosity.\n\n\n  Even in this age of surprises when almost every day some new\n\ndevelopment occurs, the invasion and annexation of Kuwait by Iraq stood\n\nout, drawing much of the attention of the world away from Europe.\n Iraq's actions brought the danger of a Middle East conflagration with\n\nrepercussions far beyond that region.\n In addition, the seizure of Kuwait and its oil-fields resulted in a\n\nsteep rise in the price of oil, and this delivered a shock to the global\n\neconomy, putting Jamaica and a great many other countries into economic\n\ndisarray. \n\n  As a result of the invasion, the United States of America, along\n\nwith a number of other countries, built up a large military presence in the\n\nGulf area, particularly in Saudi Arabia.\n The situation has been unique by reason of the fact that the Soviet\n\nUnion has stood shoulder to shoulder with the United States and other Western\n\ncountries in their determination to oppose Saddam Hussein, the President of\n\nIraq.\n Had such an event taken place just a few short years ago, the\n\nsituation would have been very different indeed.\n As a long-standing friend of Iraq and in an adversarial position vis\n\n&agrave; vis the United States and others in respect of Middle Eastern\n\naffairs, the Soviet Union could well have been on the other side.\n In 1990, however, for the first time in the postwar years, the two\n\nsuperpowers joined to form a solid front in opposition to an aggressor. \n\n  The Soviet Union voted positively on the Security Council\n\nresolutions, but has sought to play a diplomatic role designed to achieve a\n\npeaceful settlement while at the same time not mincing words about its\n\nopposition to the action of Iraq and its determination to see the reversal of\n\nthe take-over of Kuwait. \n\n \n\n  The united stance of the Soviet Union and the United States of\n\nAmerica in this matter led President Bush to make the most far-reaching\n\nstatements.\n In an address to Congress in September 1990, he spoke of the\n\nemergence of  'a new partnership of nations which stood aligned\n\nagainst Iraq's occupation of Kuwait'. \n 'We stand at a unique and extraordinary moment.\n The crisis in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, is a rare\n\nopportunity to move towards an historic period of cooperation.\n Out of these troubled times, a new world order can emerge; a new era\n\n\x13 freer from the threat of terror, stronger in the pursuit of justice, and\n\nmore secure in the quest for peace.\n An era in which the nations of the world, east and west, north and\n\nsouth, can prosper and live in harmony.' \n 'a world quite different from the one we\n\nhave known.\n A world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle.\n A world in which nations recognise the shared responsibility for\n\nfreedom and justice.\n A world where the strong respect the rights of the weak.\n This is the vision I shared with President Gorbachev in Helsinki.'\n\n \n\n  This extraordinary statement demonstrates the impact of the\n\ndevelopments which have been taking place, embracing those in Europe \x13 both\n\nEast and West \x13 and in the Gulf. \n\n  In the months following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait the world\n\nturned to the United Nations.\n The Security Council held a large number of meetings on this crisis\n\nand approved more than twelve resolutions condemning the action of Iraq,\n\ncalling for its withdrawal from Kuwait, opening the way to the use of force\n\nby the United States and other countries. \n\n  In the face of the forces opposing him, Saddam Hussein held the\n\nlarge number of Westerners in Iraq and Kuwait hostage, in order to use them\n\nas a human shield against attack.\n This caused great distress and anger.\n\n\n  As the coalition countries built up forces in the Gulf area a\n\nprocession of prominent personalities, some current, some former leaders,\n\ntravelled to Baghdad in search of a peaceful solution to the crisis, or in\n\nhope of obtaining the release of some of the hostages. \n\n  Then, on 16 January 1991, after the expiration of the deadline\n\nset by the UN Security Council for the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait, the\n\nallied forces went to war \x13 the first major conflict of the post Cold War\n\nera. \n\n \n\n\n\n  I can only give here a brief summary of some of the considerable\n\nimplications of this war.\n For the world to be brought back to such a juncture has been a matter\n\nof deep disappointment, the more so since the hope for peace had been\n\nconsiderably boosted by the ending of the Cold War. \n\n  This explains the persistence of the peace movement, and the\n\ndemonstrations against war which have been held, particularly in the Western\n\nWorld. \n\n  The vast financial and other resources being consumed by the\n\nwar represent a bitter irony as the world seeks to muster the will and the\n\nresources to tackle more purposefully the problem of growing poverty, the\n\ncritical situation of Africa, the suffering of tens of millions of children,\n\nthe dangers posed by the continuing degradation of the environment, and\n\nthe spread of  AIDS  across the globe. \n\n  Developing countries are the main losers by way of this diversion\n\nof resources.\n Moreover, there has been talk of a Marshall type plan for the\n\nreconstruction of the Gulf region at the end of hostilities. \n\n  'terrorist'\n\n incidents inspired, it is assumed, by the call by Saddam Hussein for\n\nattacks on the interests of the members of the coalition.\n As a result, extraordinary security measures have had to be\n\ninstituted by these countries.\n The truth is that war can no longer be defined in conventional terms.\n The weak will seek their own ways of striking back no matter what the\n\njudgement may be concerning those methods. \n\n  There is the sobering fact that weapons and other devices sold to\n\nIraq by Western states and the USSR might well be used against the coalition\n\nforces.\n These sales amounted to an estimated US$6 billion between 1983 and\n\n1988. \n\n  The technological sophistication of the weapons and other devices\n\nbeing used in the conflict has led to it being characterised as the  'Nintendo\n\nwar'  .\n Related to this is the US call for restrictions, which it is hoped\n\nwould also be applied by its allies, on the export of chemical and biological\n\nmaterials and missile technologies to Third World countries.\n The fear of proliferation of nuclear and biological weapons,\n\nincluding missiles, is very real.\n , of 21 January\n\n1991 that some experts now warn that establishing new restrictions on\n\nso-called North-South trade between industrial and developing countries would\n\nheighten mistrust of the West among emerging countries.\n The restrictions would apply to some dual-purpose technologies with\n\nboth military and commercial applications, for example, computer systems\n\nand software, and technologies for increasing agricultural yields.\n In February 1991, Prime minister Brian Mulroney of Canada called for\n\na global summit to stem the flow of high technology arms and weapons of mass\n\ndestruction to countries such as Iraq.\n He plans to propose this to the UN Secretary General and to ask for\n\nfurther follow-up meetings. \n\n  In addition to all this, deep concern has been expressed\n\nabout the possibility of a major ecological disaster resulting from use of\n\nchemical or nuclear weapons or by way of damage to oil installations.\n In fact, a major oil spill has occurred, with each side accusing the\n\nother of being responsible. \n\n \n\n  The opportunities offered by the presence of oil in the Gulf area\n\nmeant that, over a long period, hundreds of thousands of people arrived from\n\nAsia, Europe and elsewhere \x13 including skilled workers and professionals.\n In some instances the immigrant populations seemed likely to\n\noutnumber the host citizens.\n A long- term problem was taking shape, in any event, centring around\n\nthe civil and political rights of these workers and their families.\n But their sudden departure as a result of the Iraqi invasion of\n\nKuwait created a major refugee problem, entailed much suffering and also left\n\ngreat nervousness and sensitivity.\n People from Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Vietnam and other\n\ndeveloping countries, as well as from the West, rushed to escape as the\n\nprospect of war loomed, and as the Iraqi forces took over, literally crushing\n\nKuwait.\n How many would wish to return when things calm down is a matter for\n\nspeculation.\n The attractions are great, but so are the dangers.\n And, in general, a consciousness of the instability of the region\n\nwill remain. \n\n  Most of the refugees lost their employment and their property,\n\nwhile their families abroad lost the massive remittances sent to them by the\n\nestimated half a million workers.\n The home countries now face the terrible problem of receiving\n\nand resettling these workers.\n Most of these countries already have critical unemployment problems\n\nand will be faced with serious difficulties with the return flow. \n\n  We can imagine what would happen to Jamaica if large numbers of\n\npast emigrants were suddenly forced to return.\n Indeed, the return of Jamaicans in the 1930s, the years of the great\n\ndepression in the United States, is regarded as being one of the factors in\n\nthe upheavals of that period. \n\n \n\n  The UN was regarded in the earlier stages of the Gulf crisis as\n\nhaving come back to the centre stage, especially in respect of the area of\n\ninternational peace and security.\n The organisation was seen by the US, the Soviet Union and others as\n\nshowing its ability to occupy that position in world affairs for which it was\n\noriginally intended. \n\n  But as the war has proceeded there has been growing doubt in some\n\nquarters.\n Feelings have been expressed that the UN was coerced into giving a\n\nlicence to the US and its allies to wage unlimited war on Iraq or that the\n\nattacks have gone beyond what was implied or intended in the Council's\n\nresolution. \n\n  These feelings have been sharpened by the effects of the heavy\n\nbombardment by allied forces and the seeming reluctance on the part of the\n\nCouncil to meet, once the war had started.\n When it did meet the session, at the insistence of the US and others,\n\nwas a closed one. \n\n  In considering these views, and there are of course many who\n\nsupport the UN in this situation, it is well to recognise that that\n\norganisation is not an independent entity, capable of making its own\n\ndecisions but an intergovernmental body in which decisions are made by its\n\nmembers.\n The Security Council's resolutions were approved by a majority of the\n\nfifteen members of that body.\n But, of course, this is not to deny the possibilities of the exercise\n\nof influence or of pressure on members. \n\n \n\n  While the coalition partners in the Western world have in general\n\nmaintained their solidarity and their support, there are signs of uneasiness.\n These have become more evident as the intensive bombing of Iraq has\n\ncontinued and as news reports speak increasingly of civilian casualties.\n The launching of the ground assault by the allied forces would lead\n\nto increased casualties adding to the concern in the countries of the\n\nalliance and giving greater impetus to the anti-war movement. \n\n  It appears that the position of the European Community has\n\nbeen significantly affected by the conflict.\n A sharp comment on this was made in the New York Times of 25 January\n\n1991 by Craig Whitney who stated that the Gulf war has halted the momentum\n\ntoward political unity in Europe, breathed new life into the special\n\nrelationship between the United States and Britain, and raised widespread\n\nconcern about pacifism in Germany.", 'subdomain':

{'text': 'The deterioration of Jamaica\'s education, so alarmingly evident in\n\nrecent years, is rooted in two basic causes: the increasing poverty of the\n\nnational economy over most of the past 20 years, and the disproportionate\n\nyouthfulness of the population. \n\n  In constant 1974 prices, gross domestic product was\n\n$2,159.2 million in 1974,\n\n$1,827.8 million in 1980 and\n\n$1,979.6 million in 1988.\n The per capita figures for the same years are\n\n$1,091,\n\n$857 and\n\n$841. \n\n  Approximately half of all Jamaicans are under 21 years of age.\n Only one-third of the total population is in gainful employment, and\n\nless than a quarter is in the 30-60 years age group \x13 these being the people\n\nwith the highest economic productivity in any population.\n\n\nsources to maintain the rest of the population.\n The savings required for long-term investment in the education\n\nand training of youth has been declining in real terms over the past 15\n\nyears.\n The gap between resources and need is the more stark when it is\n\nrealised that only about 700,000 of approximately 1.1 million persons under\n\n20 years of age are in any form of educational and training programme. \n\n  What happens to the 1.1 million?\n The available figures seem to indicate:\n\n\n\n  - Only one in four receives kindergarten or pre-primary\n\neducation, which evidence has consistently shown to be important to nurture\n\nsensory talent and curiosity for more structured learning at later stages.\n\n\n\n  - Three out of four children get only about six years of formal\n\nschooling. \n\n  - Only about one in 10 completes secondary education and even\n\nfewer get post-secondary instruction of any kind. \n\n  There is virtually 100% enrollment ( about 340,000) of children\n\nin the primary school age cohort, though actual attendance is rather less.\n Enrollment in some form of secondary school is about 240,000 out of\n\nan age cohort estimated at 330,000.\n Fewer than 20,000 are currently in a tertiary level ( including\n\nuniversity) institution.\n This figure is reckoned to be between one third and a half of the\n\nmanpower which the economy needs at this level of training.\n The picture is of a population which is not well educated or trained.\n There is a high proportion of unskilled labour, which is a\n\nlimiting factor in the equation which leads to economic growth. \n\n  At various times over the past 30 years the government has spent\n\nbetween 12% and 18% of its budget on education.\n It should be spending 17% or 18% consistently but this will only be\n\npossible if the government divests some of its current ( non-educational)\n\nactivities and concentrates its resources. \n\n  Serious consideration should be given to the comparative\n\ndistribution of state resources between the different educational levels and\n\ninstitutions.\n There is a considerable difference between the per capita\n\nexpenditures on primary, secondary and tertiary students.\n The official figures show that during 1987/88 the state expended an\n\n  average of\n\n$18,258 on each UWI student.\n This is 35 times the sum spent on primary school students (\n\n$516), 18 times the sum spent on secondary school students, and more than\n\nthree times the sum spent per CAST student. \n\n \n\nlation it is obvious that Jamaica requires a sound primary and secondary\n\nschool system in order to provide the foundation for social and economic\n\ndevelopment.\n Government spending on a university student 35 times what it\n\nspends on a primary school student and 18 times that which it spends on a\n\nsecondary school student does not fit in with the obvious priorities needed\n\nto improve the social and economic conditions of Jamaica. \n\n  What is the quality of education received?\n A survey done by the Ministry of Education in the early 1980s\n\nsuggested that about half the children completing primary education (\n\nage 11 or 12) were functionally illiterate.\n About 25% of students who sit the Common Entrance Examination after\n\nGrade 6 are awarded the available places in High Schools and Technical High\n\nSchools.\n They, in other words, are the cream of the crop.\n However, after five more years of the best secondary education the\n\ncountry has to offer, these students perform poorly in the CXC and GCE\n\n \'O\'  Level examinations. \n\n  The performance of students in High and Technical High Schools \x13\n\nthe more desirable secondary schools \x13 is disappointing.\n These students, be it remembered, are the top 25% of those who sit\n\nthe Common Entrance Examination and are the great majority of candidates\n\nin the CXC and GCE  \'O\'  level exams.\n In recent years only one out of three students achieves a " \'credit\'\n\n" or better ( which means CXC pass at grade 1 or 2; or GCE Ordinary\n\nlevel pass at grade A,B or C) in English Language and Physics.\n Barely one in four achieves that standard in Mathematics and Biology,\n\nslightly over two out of five in Chemistry.\n subject such as Caribbean History,\n\nfewer than half the number of students sitting the exam reach that standard.\n The numbers sitting the exams cast an even more unfavourable light on\n\nthese results.\n sciences or\n\nforeign languages. \n\n  There was great concern in the early 1970s that only one in four\n\nstudents who sat the CXC or GCE  \'O\'  level examinations was\n\ngetting at least five passes including English Language and Mathematics.\n This was considered the minimum requirement for many jobs and\n\nfor further training in occupations such as nursing and teaching.\n Though more students sit the exams today there has been a steady\n\nfalling away even from the unsatisfactory levels of performance on the early\n\n .\n The performance of Jamaican students in these examinations has for\n\nseveral years been among the worst in the English-speaking Caribbean.\n The UWI has now instituted a proficiency test and a remedial course\n\nin English for some students who are accepted to read for a degree.   \n\n  The remaining 75% of the 12-year-olds who do not get into High\n\nSchools face an even more dismal prospect.\n Some receive no further schooling, others attend New Secondary and\n\nAll-Age schools where the level of performance is considerably below\n\nthat of the High and Technical schools.\n There appears to be no clear objectives for the New Secondary and\n\nolder students at All-Age schools \x13 for instance, remedial, vocational or\n\nsome form of job apprenticeship programme.\n Complaints about the JSC examination multiply.\n Some educators argue that the HEART academies rob these schools as\n\nwell as primary schools of the resources they need to provide an effective\n\neducation.\n Indeed the entire structure of teenage education and training is\n\na muddle of conflicting aims and dubious standards. \n\n  There are two clear inferences to be drawn from this state of\n\naffairs: first, the educational structure rests on a collapsing\n\nfoundation; and second, the quality of teaching is poor and getting worse.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Government involvement in education in Jamaica began in the\n\nimmediate post-emancipation years when the British Government provided a\n\nsum of money to churches for the instruction of ex-slaves to help transform\n\nthem into free subjects.\n It was intended that this responsibility would be gradually taken\n\nover by the colonial legislatures, but the funds were not forthcoming\n\nfor some years even after grants from the imperial government ceased.\n It was not until around 1890 that a system of free Elementary\n\nschools was formally established by the government.\n Until well into the 20th century, elementary schooling was roughly\n\nequally shared by the churches and the government. \n\n  A couple dozen secondary schools catered to the children of those\n\nwho could afford the fees.\n Only two were government institutions but all charged fees which, ac\n\n<l> cording to Professor Errol Miller  , amounted to around 65%\n\nof the expenses of the institutions by 1938. \n Church, State and Secondary Education in Jamaica 1912-1943\n\n Errol Miller, in  Education in the Caribbean  : Historical\n\nPerspectives, Edited by Ruby Hope King, UWI Faculty of Education 1987\n\n\n Government grants were made to 23 of those schools ( mostly\n\nowned by churches and private trusts) and represented nearly 16% of their\n\nexpenses.\n A few teacher training colleges, again largely church-run, provided\n\nthe teachers for the elementary schools. \n\n  Primary, secondary, and vocational training expanded steadily\n\nnevertheless, with many private individuals organising schools of varying\n\nquality, but which supplemented the church-run institutions as well as\n\ngovernment elementary schools.\n By the end of the 1940s about two out of three children of primary\n\nschool age were enrolled in a school but only about 5,000 or 15% of the\n\nsecondary school age cohort.\n There was still a gap at the primary level but the greatest shortage\n\nof educational opportunity for the majority was at the secondary level. \n\n  With the acceleration of the self-government movement after World\n\nWar II, the government put significantly increased resources into education.\n The University College was established and in the course of the\n\n1950s, funding of most of the operating expenses for secondary schools was\n\nassumed by the government, teacher training colleges were expanded and\n\nthe College of Arts, Science and Technology ( CAST) was established.\n In 1957 the 11-plus examination was instituted to provide free places\n\nin secondary schools for children who showed aptitude for further education\n\nof the grammar school type but whose parents would not have been able to\n\nafford the fees.\n The major emphasis over the next 15 years was the expansion of\n\nsecondary education.\n By the end of the 1960s it was clear that primary schooling was\n\nsuffering relative neglect and that  salaries were falling\n\nbehind cost-of-living increases. \n\n  In the 1970s the government expanded free education to the\n\nuniversity and CAST, increased financial support for infant or pre-primary\n\neducation and launched an ambitious adult literacy programme.\n The state assumed near total responsibility for education at all\n\nlevels while, almost simultaneously, the economy began a sharp, long-term\n\ndecline.\n With the expansion of government support of tertiary education, there\n\nwere immediate consequences: first, real resources for secondary and, even\n\nmore significantly, for  primary  education were cut back; second,\n\nthe real income of teachers went into accelerated decline. \n\n  The effect was to increase the numbers in school, especially\n\nin tertiary institutions, but to dilute the quality of education at all\n\nlevels because the flight of better qualified teachers from the\n\nclassroom became noticeable at this time.\n examination performance\n\nwas clearly evident by the late 1970s and continued throughout the  .\n \'\n\n80s  included an aborted attempt at compulsory school attendance, and an\n\nexpanded program to provide school lunches.\n\n\nment and Resource Training ( HEART) program to provide job- training for\n\nunemployed teenagers who were unqualified for regular tertiary education.\n at UWI and CAST, the\n\nimposition of an Education Tax and HEART payroll deductions, government\n\neducation budgets declined in real terms as well as in percentage of fiscal\n\nbudget. \n 2 called a " \'cess\' " and representing 10% of the\n\neconomic cost per student in most disciplines and about 7% in Engineering and\n\nAgriculture. \n The effect of financial contraction was aggravated by a new and\n\nunwelcome phenomenon: chronic burglarising and vandalisation of schools.\n In addition to poor pay, teachers have had to contend with wrecked\n\nfacilities and the stealing of furnishings, equipment and educational\n\nsupplies. \n\n \n\n  By any rational calculation teaching should be one of the most\n\nintrinsically satisfying of all jobs.\n Instead it has become a residual occupation in Jamaica \x13 something to\n\ndo when there is hardly any other choice.\n The nation now has some 20,000 teachers covering infant to university\n\ninstitutions.\n\n\ntable \n\n  Over 90 percent of teachers are said to be trained; that is, they\n\nhave received a teacher\'s certificate from a training college, or less\n\ncommon, a graduate diploma in education from a university.\n This, however, is a misleading index of the quality of education\n\noffered in schools.\n Over the past decade university graduates as a percentage of teachers\n\nin high schools have fallen from about 50% to less than 33%.\n In New Secondary schools the only graduates are likely to be the\n\nPrincipal and her deputy.\n Experience is obviously another powerful factor in the quality of\n\nteaching, and while no statistics have been published there is abundant\n\nevidence of rapid turnover and, hence, a declining average length of\n\nservice in the teaching profession.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '2a8b3863-2135-4adb-82e9-ad4e2d41f922', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.394173+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9761568903923035, 'non_english_score': 0.023843109607696533}

K.\n\nMenon,  'Disarmament and Development'  .\n\n Both, the various alternatives to war and its awesome destructive\n\npowers, are the consequences of the modern scientific revolution. \n\n  In his relentless quest to understand his surroundings, man has\n\ninvented a method of uncovering truth called science.\n Observations, analyses and logical reasoning are deployed to discover\n\nfacts objectively and to fit them into a comprehensive whole.\n Scientific results have proved to be so useful to military and\n\neconomic development that most aware nations have invested heavily in\n\nencouraging ever-increasing scientific activity.\n The explosion of information thus created has literally transformed\n\nall aspects of life as technology, the practical application of science,\n\naffects man's environment. \n\n  In considering the possibility of world peace, we find that the\n\nconcept of development becomes important.\n Development refers to a country's ability to satisfy its\n\nmaterial, cultural and spiritual needs.\n When a country can supply its material needs and wants, it is\n\nreferred to as developed.\n If it cannot, it is defined as underdeveloped.\n It should be recognized however, that a nation may be underdeveloped\n\nin a spiritual and psychological sense, while developed in a material sense.\n This is true of many of the highly industrialized countries today.\n\n\n\n \n\nstanding of peace.\n Ways in which a more peaceful world may be created are explored and\n\nthe role of science and its technologies in this quest are adumbrated,\n\ntogether with suggestions for promoting a just and lasting peace. \n\n \n\n  or analytical purposes, there are two types of\n\npeace: negative peace and positive peace.  \n Thinking Head - UNESCO and the challenges of today\n\nand tomorrow.  Paris, 1977. \n Negative peace exists when there is the absence of violence or\n\nhostilities, while positive peace prevails when there is not only an absence\n\nof tension and violence, but also a community of interest among people,\n\nimpelling them to cooperate in an atmosphere of kinship, justice and mutual\n\nrespect.\n Peace among nations must go beyond mere political diplomacy.\n It must include social, cultural and economic relations based on\n\nvoluntary cooperation which is, in turn, founded on equity and justice.\n Understanding, friendship and mutual enrichment will surface in\n\npositive peace so that intellectual and moral fellowship will naturally\n\nfollow.\n Military security will then be replaced by economic security, the\n\nforemost security of all. \n\n  Both war and peace start in the mind of man.\n For true peace to exist, a new psychological awareness must embrace\n\npeace as the overriding precondition for human progress.\n Peace must replace war as the power-base for man if he is to harness\n\nhis true potential. \n\n  Observations over the years have led to the identification of\n\ncertain elements which promote tension, sporadic violence and, ultimately,\n\nwar.\n Chief among these influences are the great material disparities\n\nwithin and among societies.\n In both developed and underdeveloped countries, these disparities\n\noften reach extreme proportions when the basic needs of large sections of a\n\npopulation are denied as the direct result of exorbitant self-interest and\n\nrugged individualism in socio-political systems.\n Jamaica is a prime example of these sorts of divisions.\n Because of the small size of the island and the extremes in economic\n\ndisparities, which are among the worst in the world, excessive need and\n\nover-whelming greed rub shoulders daily. \n\n  The gap between the well-being of a few and the vital needs of\n\nthe majority of mankind is steadily growing.\n Appalling conditions, distantly associated with early capitalism, now\n\nexist in many underdeveloped countries as a consequence of misguided attempts\n\nto cater to an absurd international economic order, based on the ideology of\n\na so-called free market system.\n The results are islets of wealth in a sea of poverty and despair.\n In Jamaica the results are internecine violence and murderous\n\nassaults on the established order and those who are symbols of oppression.\n\n\n\n  Starvation, disease and premature death are the products of such\n\nbackward social systems.\n Underdevelopment is not ordained; it is simply the result of an\n\norganized system of domination and exploitation.\n Among the most dangerous consequences to the world of this\n\nman-made poverty is that, each second, legions of children are being added to\n\nthe pool of despair, without the mental or physical strength to cope.\n Over-population looms in these circumstances, outstripping all\n\nattempts to ameliorate conditions. \n\n  Against this background of ignorance, squalor and early\n\ndeath, a few indulge in scandalous excesses of over-consumption and\n\nostentation.\n Scarce resources are squandered worldwide in maintaining military\n\nestablishments which now swallow over one thousand billion dollars a year.\n\n \n\n\nYear Book  , Stockholm, 1989 and M. G. K. Menon,  'Disarmament\n\nand Development'  ,  Scientific World 3  . 1987. \n More than a quarter of the world's scientific effort is spent in\n\ncreating ever more powerful weapons of terror and mass destruction.\n So awesome have these weapons become that they are no longer\n\nconsidered to have a true military rationale, because they cannot be used to\n\ngain any serious military advantage.  \n\n Once they are used, our human world will end.\n Nevertheless, non-renewable energy and mineral supplies, dwindling\n\ncapital and great scientific effort are wasted yearly on a massive scale to\n\nmaintain so- called security.\n This is surely a monstrous waste of human capacity, tending to\n\nprovoke war and militate against peace. \n\n  Our planet is now under tremendous pressure from the\n\nindiscriminate activities of man.\n Air, water and land are being bombarded by the refuse of the\n\nindustrialization with which man threatens his own existence.\n Industrial and other activities in any one country can now pollute\n\nand jeopardize life in another.\n If this continues unabated, the inevitable consequence is conflict.\n Already there are claims and counter claims as to who is responsible\n\nfor acid rain, ozone depletion, marine pollution, destruction of sea life and\n\npollution of outer space.\n At the same time, the pressures of poverty cause massive soil\n\nerosion, with increased likelihood of flooding across national boundaries,\n\nand great disturbances in the balance of atmospheric gases, the result of\n\nburning fuels to provide domestic energy. \n\n  Not only is there pressure on our ecosystem from population\n\ngrowth and need, but also as sequels to the draconian policies of\n\nmultilateral funding agencies.  \n 5.

As Brazil's debt burden grows poverty increases, forcing peasants\n\nto burn trees to make space in the Amazon rain forest to plant food crops.\n\n\n Even here in Jamaica, woodlands are being destroyed at the rate of\n\nthree to four per cent a year.\n Between 1981 and 1990, according to Dr Allan Eyre of the University\n\nof the West Indies, 324,805 acres of forest were converted to other uses.\n Already the underdeveloped countries argue bitterly, when they are\n\nasked to slow down their much-needed development for the sake of the world's\n\nenvironment, that they are being made to pay for the decades of profligate\n\nliving in the industrialized states. \n\n  Another major source on international tension and potential\n\nconflict is political arrogance.\n Because of their privileged economic and military positions, the\n\nindustrialized states act as if the rest of the world exists only to do their\n\nbidding, assuming that their own culture is the only one worth pre <l>\n\nserving.\n Their contempt for international law and order belies their much\n\nvaunted respect for justice and peace.\n The lessons of history and the transience of empires, are lost\n\non them, as they dominate, discriminate, exploit and pollute.\n At all levels of the so-called civilized societies, the denial of\n\nlegitimate human rights has been so pervasive that respect for life\n\nis still wanting.\n Defiant children, as in Israel, have begun to challenge political\n\nleadership, launching campaigns of terror against society itself. \n\n  Around the world the lessons of crime, violence and acquisition\n\nare so well learnt that, to gain partisan advantage, financial power,\n\nperceived rights or even to serve God, torture, pillage and mutilation are\n\npractised with bloody effect.\n Who is a terrorist is defined by the cause which is being attacked.\n The leaders have shown the way and the children have learnt the\n\nshort-term gains of cruelty, imprisonment and the fear of death.\n Here in Jamaica partisan politics have been held responsible for\n\nstarting the orgy of guns.\n Now, however, politicians have no way of controlling the recurring\n\nwaves of murder by the gun.\n In many societies, the sale of guns of all kinds is legitimized,\n\nirrespective of the deadly consequences.\n So antagonism and hate reign between brothers, causes and nations.\n\n\n\n  Even when altruism is displayed, it is laced with invidious\n\nsociopolitical motives.\n Food, for example, is used as an instrument of political blackmail,\n\nfinancial and technical aid as a simple way to promote trade, and offers of\n\neducation as a means of recruiting adherents to political or religious\n\nideology.\n These realities must be mentioned because the search for truth is the\n\nonly way toward a lasting peace. \n\n \n\n  he lack of peace in the world arises essentially\n\nfrom the bankrupt striving of man to maintain dominance over others and to\n\ncreate material wealth far beyond the practical needs of individuals and\n\nsocieties.\n The way toward peace, then, must begin with the amelioration, and\n\nwhere possible elimination, of these destructive courses.\n The impediments to peace which can be identified nationally\n\nfrequently mirror the problems at the international level.\n Strictly national problems are often the result of superstition,\n\nignorance or insecurity. \n\n  In a general sense, it has to be recognized that for peace to\n\nbecome firmly entrenched, it must be actively pursued at the highest levels\n\nof leadership.\n The mere absence of war, tension or conflict, in itself, is not\n\nenough.\n\n\ntation must be removed, and in their place, positive initiatives for peace\n\nconstructed.\n For example, glorification of war must be viewed as barbaric, armies\n\nmust be abolished, and the sale of armaments rejected as suicidal.\n Doctrines of spheres of influence, vital interests and surrogate\n\nstates must be abandoned.\n Military security must be seen as a contradiction in terms.\n In its place economic security must be sought for each human being.\n This is not as visionary as it may seem.\n In 1980 it was estimated that seventeen billion US dollars were\n\nrequired to feed, clothe, house and provide health service for all of\n\nhumanity.\n 7\n\n \n 'Main trends in and prospects for the\n\ndevelopment of Science and  responsibilities in working\n\nfor peace'  .

{'text': 'first heard of Jamaica Welfare in the early\n\npart of 1943.\n My father-in-law, Ansell Hart who, I later discovered, was one of the\n\nfounding associates of Norman Manley in the establishment of the\n\norganization, used to complain of the lengthy meetings that Manley held.\n But it was soon obvious that his complaints provided him with the\n\nopportunity to talk about this venture in which he was deeply involved.\n Soon he had me interested and, in August 1943, I joined the office\n\nstaff of Jamaica Welfare.  \n\n  Many years later, the Secretary of Jamaica Welfare, R H Fletcher,\n\npassed on to me recommendations of which I had been unaware.\n Handwritten on a compliments slip from the law firm Manton & Hart were\n\nthe words:\n \'Dear Norman:\n What do you think of Pansy for one of the jobs that seem to arise in\n\nJ.W. Ltd?\n She seems so efficient that it seems a pity her services can\'t be\n\nused.\n\n \'Have told\n\nFletcher long ago that she should have next vacancy.\n She will do I feel sure v. well and take a live interest.\n\n And it was often in that manner of perception that many of the early\n\nstaff of Jamaica Welfare were recruited. \n\n  Arthur Carney, one of Jamaica Welfare\'s finest officers, tells of\n\nhaving attended a Credit Union meeting where Mr Manley had given an address.\n A lively discussion followed in which Carney had participated.\n Some days later he received a telephone call from D T M Girvan, then\n\nCooperative Officer of the company.\n \'Artie, I have just left Mr Manley.\n You know what he said?\n " I was at a Credit Union meeting on Friday night and I met a\n\nfellow called \x13 I can\'t remember his name \x13 he is a tall, dark fellow.\n\n \'just tell me when you can come.\'\n\n \n\n  Norman Manley was the founder of Jamaica Welfare and its chairman\n\nfor eleven years.\n Professor Roger Marier, who was sent by UNESCO in 1952 to do a study\n\nof the organization which had gained world-wide recognition, writes:\n\n\n\n  The formation of Jamaica Welfare arose from\n\ndiscontent, particularly amongst the banana growers in their relationships\n\nwith the fruit companies, which virtually controlled the marketing of the\n\ncrop.\n\n  Actually Manley had been involved with the formation of the\n\nJamaica Banana  Association, a cooperative organization\n\nmeant to combat the large foreign companies.\n written in 1969,\n\nManley stated  \'I came into the picture at an early stage. &\n I well recall the long nights of work till the early hours of the\n\nmorning and the enormous amount I learnt about the social and economic\n\nconditions of Jamaica.\'  \n\n  When problems arose, Manley wrote;\n \'I remembered going here, there and everywhere in Jamaica,\n\ntalking to rural audiences about loyalty and the good they could get out of\n\nthe Co-op movement if they stood by it in all circumstances.\'  \n\n  Later Manley went to the United States as a member of a\n\ndelegation appointed by the Banana  Association to\n\nnegotiate with Samuel Zemurray, president of the United Fruit Company.\n\n\n  &about the history of my people, the difficulties they faced, the\n\nvalues that might be learned from the Co-operative Movement.\n I had gone for an hour\'s interview.\n I was there from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. \x13 four hours in all.\n I found Zemurray listening with absorbed interest.\n What he had to say was sympathetic and understanding.\n I did not leave with the illusion that he would deal with the Co-op,\n\nbut I left feeling that I had opened up his mind along new channels& \n\n\n\n  \'the business was saved but\n\nthe Co- operative perished.\' \n\n\n  When it was all over, one morning Zemurray asked me to stay on\n\nand then took my breath away with a proposal which he   said derived from his talk with me a month before.\n The proposal was that the United Fruit Co. would set aside one cent\n\nper stem exported from Jamaica to form a fund to be administered by an\n\norganization to be created by me for the good and welfare of the people of\n\nJamaica, with emphasis on the rural people.\n This would mean, as things then stood, some 25,000,000 cents or\n\n250,00 dollars & nearly &pound;80,000 annually. \n\n  This was a most exciting matter.\n I was to form a competent executive board and report annually.\n But that was all.\n We were to be free to plan as we thought best.\n The other American companies, he promised, would join in, as indeed\n\nthey did.  \n\n  At this time Norman Manley was at the height of his career; a\n\nbrilliant, successful advocate, a patron of sports and the arts, with an\n\nactive social life.\n Widely admired, " \'Barrister Manley\' " was a\n\nhousehold name throughout Jamaica.\n But he had become alarmed at finding himself part of the\n\nestablishment and felt an urge, as he expressed in a letter to his wife Edna,\n\n \'to discover some purpose in life beyond my primary needs \x13 something\n\nthat one wants passionately to do or help to do for no reason connected with\n\nself.\'  \n\n  Here now was the new challenge he needed.\n Occasional jottings in his diary during 1937 and 1938 reflect his\n\nenthusiasm as well as anxiety.\n \'Sept. 5, 1937.\n Yesterday got cheque No. 1, 62,264 dollars.\n\n\n\n There are also various notes on persons and ideas to do with the\n\norganization.\n With the launching of Jamaica Welfare in mind he had begun\n\ntravelling round the island whenever his legal work would allow, studying in\n\nparticular the conditions of the rural population [ Brown]. \n\n  Manley sought out people with social awareness and competence in\n\nvarious fields to assist him.\n \'Saw Philip Sherlock on\n\nThursday.\n He lent me some books on the Danish Agric[ultural] Schools and\n\nproduced a complete plan for my scheme.\n\n\n  Jamaica Welfare Limited was registered on 7 June, 1937, with the\n\nobjectives: \n\n  To promote, manage and control schemes for and to do any\n\nact or thing which may directly or indirectly serve the general interests and\n\nthe social or economic betterment and aid of the agricultural or working\n\npeasantry, small settlers, farmers, labourers and working people of and in\n\nJamaica. \n\n  To engage in any work or activity directly or indirectly\n\nrelating to the health, cultural improvement, education, recreation,\n\nagriculture, industry, finances, trade, justice and morals of or for the\n\npersons described&  \n\n  The Directors were Ansell Hart, Lewis Ashenheim, U Theo McKay,\n\nRudolph Burke, G G R Sharp, Edith Clarke, Dr W E McCulloch, C N Heming \x13\n\npersons in law, agriculture, business, and including an anthropologist\n\nand a doctor who was a nutrition specialist.\n Philip Sherlock, educator, was appointed later.\n The Board met frequently and each member often had specific\n\nassignments.\n Mr Manley had also received useful advice from Miss Digby of the\n\nHorace Plunkett Found-ation in England, which had shown early interest in the\n\nproposed organization.\n Great care was taken in making and examining proposals before\n\ndeciding on any plan of action.\n Years later, when I had access to the minutes of meetings, the\n\nreason for Ansell Hart\'s complaint was evident.\n In the early, formative years, meetings could seem interminable.\n On one occasion a meeting which started at 4.00 p.m. adjourned at\n\n8.30 p.m. and reconvened later the same night at Mr Manley\'s house! \n\n  Staff was literally handpicked.\n Manley wrote,\n\n \'Welfare tapped a deep stream of middle-class interests in Jamaica.\n We had no trouble in building a good staff.\n School teachers were anxious to come in and were prepared to do so\n\non terms that meant no financial benefit to them but answered a deep feeling\n\nthat rural Jamaica needed special help.\'  \n\n  The decision was taken to establish Community Centres which\n\nwould be the focal points from which other developments would follow.\n E B Hallett, an Englishman, Secretary of the YMCA in Kingston, was\n\nseconded to Jamaica Welfare and was sent to investigate rural conditions and\n\npossibilities.\n Guy\'s Hill was selected to have the first Centre which was opened on\n\nOctober 5, 1938.\n Evan Donaldson, who had been an associate of Hallett in voluntary\n\nsocial work, was sent to England for training and on his return was put in\n\ncharge of the Centre. \n\n  In August of the following year, a second Centre was opened in\n\nPorus.\n In charge was Eddie Burke, whose innovative methods as a\n\nteacher had impressed Mr Manley.\n He had been sent to St Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Nova\n\nScotia, to study Cooperatives and community education.\n A woman assistant was appointed to each Centre and a nurse was later\n\nadded to the staff to advise on birth control measures, principally.\n However, the Company had to abandon this, it was said for religious\n\nreasons. \n\n  The programmes at the Centres covered a wide range of subjects:\n\nsewing, cooking, handcrafts, singing, dancing, \n\ngames, lectures and debates.\n Each centre had a library.\n Three paintings by Albert Huie were purchased for &pound; 25 and\n\nhung in the Centres (\n Some years later when I had established the Staff Library, I used to\n\ndisplay paintings by some of the emerging artists, notably Daley, along the\n\ntop of the bookcases.\n\n\n  An early feature of Jamaica Welfare was the establishment\n\nof Film Units, in collaboration with the Education Department.\n Each unit was staffed by a lecturer-demonstrator and a\n\nchauffeur-mechanic.\n The shows, both educational and for entertainment, were given on a\n\nregular basis at the Centres and in country schoolrooms.\n Only recently, a senior army officer told me that as a country boy\n\nhis first introduction to the wider world and the wonders of technology came\n\nfrom the Jamaica Welfare Film Unit which visited his little village. \n\n  Manley was convinced that cooperatives had great potential for\n\nimproving economic conditions.\n D T M Girvan, recruited from a promising business career, was\n\nappointed Cooperative Officer and was later sent abroad to gain further\n\nexperience.\n Study clubs for cooperative education were subsequently started as\n\nwere savings and credit unions to encourage thrift.\n The Jamaica Cooperative Union was formed in 1942 to promote the\n\ndevelopment of cooperatives and to coordinate the activities of cooperative\n\ngroups and societies.\n The principal officers of the Union were Thom Girvan, Chairman;\n\nArthur Carney, Treasurer; and Chester Dowdy, Secretary, all staff members of\n\nJamaica Welfare.\n The Jamaica Cooperative Development Council was also formed to\n\nsupervise and coordinate all cooperative development and to ensure that the\n\nessential Rochdale principles of cooperation were observed.\n Mr Manley was the Chairman and Mr Arthur Carney the Secretary of\n\nthe Development Council. \n\n  It had been hoped that the activities at the Community Centres\n\nwould reach out and involve the people of the communities so that they would,\n\nin due course, assume responsibility for the Centres and proceed to plan for\n\nwhat they wanted.\n But the attitude persisted that the Centres belonged to Jamaica\n\nWelfare which had money to spend.\n There was no development of a community spirit and participation\n\nwas superficial.\n Numerous conferences were held between staff and the Board to\n\nexamine and evaluate the situation and to agree on a new policy. \n\n  It was decided that the initial aim would be to enlist village\n\ninterest and desire before attempting to start any project.\n\n\nand, as originally drafted by Thom Girvan, was based on the premise that\n\n \'Building a better village depends first and foremost on the desire\n\nof the villagers for self-improvement.\' \n The Welfare Officer would study the needs of the village and serve\n\nas the catalyst to stimulate community awareness and interest.\n A Village Committee would be formed of a few interested persons who\n\nwould come together and plan to get wider participation.\n This would lead to the formation of a Community Association, the\n\ngoverning body of which would be the Community Council composed of persons\n\nelected from whatever groups existed and/or of direct members.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '9234c1b8-b143-48de-a1c4-f9530e34d2d6', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.396857+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9877623319625854, 'non_english_score': 0.01223766803741455}
{'text': 'The use of caves by the Jamaican and Caribbean Taino as\n\nmulti-purpose depositories has been recorded from the sixteenth century to\n\nthe present time for burials, for petroglyph sculptures and pictograph\n\nmurals, all with corollary mystical and religious connotations.\n Caves were also used by the Taino as sacrosanct shrines and\n\nsanctuaries wherein were placed  \'images\'  of supreme\n\nmagico-religious, iconographic, socio-cultural and socio-political\n\nsignificance accessed only by the  nitaino  ,  \'the noble\n\nones\'  , specifically the  ca&ccedille;iques  ( chiefs) and\n\nthe  boyez/bohuti  ( the shamen). \n\n  Within Caribbean Taino material culture assemblages of art and\n\ncraft objects of various dimensions in bone, clay, stone, ivory, wood, shell,\n\nguannin and doré gold ( mined gold and river gold) and other\n\nmaterials, can be found sculptures and carvings of heads, figures and shapes\n\nin anthropomorphic, zoomorphic or zoological form depicting the\n\nprincipal and minor deities of the Taino pantheon.\n .\n These simple or complex objects are often combined with a more secular\n\nuse, can be free- standing or pendant for use and display, individually or as\n\npart of an object arrangement.\n , ceramic containers such\n\nas  \'boat-shaped\'  vessels decorated with  adornos  ,\n\n( clay sculptured images), greenstone petaloid celts, wooden  duhos \n\n( ceremonial seats) and stone  metates  ( elaborate grain-kneading\n\nplatforms).\n There are also spears and spearheads of wood, stone, shell and bone;\n\ndarts, throwing-sticks and stone axes; wooden canoes and oars; wooden bowls,\n\nwooden fire drills; bone, stone shell, wooden, coral and other beads; gold\n\njewellery; organic fibre containers, baskets of various types, calabash\n\ngourds; three-pointed stones, anthropomorphic/zoomorphic/zoological statues\n\nin multimedia; ceramic cloth- marking stamps and seals, shell masks and\n\nstone, bone, and wooden vomiting spatulae and other objects.   \n\n \n\n  The earliest published probable depiction of a carved Jamaican\n\nTaino wooden image is shown in a cartouche on the 1752  AD\n\n West Indian map of Captain John Henry Schroeter.\n Around the border of the plan are illustrations of zemis, at least\n\ntwo of which are wooden, described as  \'characteristic of the\n\naboriginal inhabitants of the Antilles\'  .\n on a tapered\n\nwooden cylinder, all carved out of one piece, resembling Object A.\n The exact provenance of this cartouche remains obscure but Schroeter\n\nserved as a captain of the garrison at Fort Balcarres, Trelawny, and could\n\nhave observed such objects there.\n The cartouche also bears similarities to the earliest, unequivocably\n\nJamaican Taino cave-provenanced wooden zemis, described below, found about\n\nthe time of the publications of the plan. \n\n  Still not fully provenanced, two wooden zemis were found some\n\ntime before May 25, 1757  AD  , on  \'a large\n\nJamaican estate, near the entrance of a deep cave\'  .\n One was presented on that date to the British Museum by James\n\nTheobald who described it as having been found by a friend  \'some\n\nyears ago\'  .\n This zemi may be the same as a small wooden carving ( 39.5 cm high)\n\nnow at the British Museum depicting a pelican and snake entwined at the mouth\n\nunder a  cohoba  bowl.\n is the Arawak word for tobacco, particularly in its\n\npowdered form as snuff.\n\n\ncohoba  bowl was lit and the participants drew the smoke up through a\n\nforked nose pipe called a  tabaco  .\n This was the word the early Spanish colonizers mistakenly applied to\n\nwhat we now know as tobacco.\n The second zemi may be that housed at the Museum of Primitive Art in\n\nNew York and later at the Rockefeller Foundation, Washington DC.\n It has been given a Jamaican provenance, and has a grotesque, staring\n\nvisage and male torso.\n bowl.\n Irving Rouse and José Arrom have described this zemi as\n\ndepicting the Taino deity  Baidrama  .\n\n\n  Three more wooden carvings were found by a land surveyor in June,\n\n1792, in a natural dry cave near the peak of high hill called " \'Spots\'\n\n" in the Carpenter\'s Mountains of the   old Vere parish, southern Manchester.\n They were facing the east, towards the rising sun and Hispaniola.\n On April 11, 1799, they were presented to the British Museum, where\n\nthey remain today.\n The three wooden carvings in this find consisted of a male\n\nfigure with a weeping face and outstretched legs, a human torso and the arms\n\nbent at the sides across the lower body; an anthropomorphic figure with an\n\navian head and the arms and legs outstretched from a human body ( 88.8 cm),\n\nthe so-called " \'Bird Man\' " ; and  \'a\n\ngrotesque-faced weeping figure\'  with a flattened canopy above the\n\nhead, joined hands and stylized feet ( 37.5 cm). \n\n  In July 1939, the government of Jamaica submitted a request for\n\nthe repatriation of these pieces, discovered in 1792.\n In response, the Trustees of the British Museum presented Jamaica\n\nwith plaster casts of the male figure and the Bird Man and, in error, a cast\n\nof  \'the 1757 pelican and snake carving\'  .\n All three have been on display at the White Marl Arawak Museum since\n\nit opened in 1966. \n\n  Since the 1960s an attempt has been made to rediscover the\n\n \'high hill\'  once known as Spots.\n In 1965 a cavern in the Carpenter\'s Mountains known locally as the\n\n \'Image Cave\'  yielded to Dr James W. Lee, then President of\n\nthe Archaeological Society of Jamaica, no wooden carvings, pictographs\n\nor petroglyphs but a wooden spindle or loom weight, the sole example in\n\nCaribbean Taino collections.\n This discovery proved that the Taino at least made use of the Image\n\nCave.\n The cave is located within a twenty-mile radius of the Redware\n\nCeramic Site Complex at Alligator Pond and the Aboukir Cave findspot itself.\n The Spots finds, like the Aboukir pieces, were very exceptionally\n\nfound all in one place and, in the context of Caribbean Taino, represent a\n\n  unique combination of images, among the\n\nfinest achievements known of Taino Art. \n\n  A ninth Jamaican Taino wooden carving was reportedly located\n\nwithin the same decade as the Aboukir find in a shallow cave immediately in\n\nfront of the present New Seville Great House gate, St Ann.\n I was told in March, 1991, that in the 1940s a child at play fell\n\ninto this cave and came out holding a small wooden figure about twelve inches\n\nhigh, apparently made of lignum vitae and with a  \'hideous doll-face\'\n\n .\n It was eventually mislaid in the overseer\'s house at Seville.\n I had heard this story earlier from Captain Charles Cotter in 1975\n\nand I do not doubt its veracity.\n The object has not been seen for some fifty years but it appears to\n\nhave been similar to the known pieces.\n It too was found in a cave, also within a twenty-mile radius of\n\nAboukir, near to the large Taino site of Maima which featured prominently in\n\nJamaica\'s proto-historic period. \n\n  Thus, prior to the Aboukir find, six Taino carved wooden objects\n\nhad been discovered in Jamaica in three separate caves with heights varying\n\nfrom one to three feet.\n They contain anthropomorphic, zoomorphic or zoological images similar\n\nenough and with sufficient parallels to each other to be deemed to relate to\n\none culture, the Taino Nation.\n objects are similarly linked to these\n\nsix and extend the height range from six inches to five feet six inches. \n\n \n\n  The Jamaican ( Caribbean) Taino were pantheists whose mythology\n\nand religion included vibrant magico-religious forces founded upon four\n\nprincipal deities and a number of minor spirits, all of which were\n\nrepresented and incarnated in human or semi-human form materially as zemis\n\nmade of or depicted on wood or stone.\n Animistic in manifestation, the foundation was based on ancestral and\n\ncreation stories to explain human and elemental origins.\n The stories provided a conduit to the deities for appeals and\n\nblessings, enabling the individual to achieve a utopian afterlife. \n\n  The primary male deity was god of the heavens, the elements, the\n\nskies, volcanoes, thunder, lightning, storms and hurricanes, which word is\n\nitself derived from the Arawak " \'Huracan\' " , an\n\nalternative named for this deity.\n His counterpart was the female earth goddess, his mother and\n\nsometimes consort who controlled fertility, agriculture, flora and fauna,\n\nvalleys and bodies of water.\n The third deity was the guardian who led the dead Taino to their\n\nheaven,  Coyoba  , in the islands to the south.\n His counterpart, also male, was a kind of benevolent uncle and father\n\nbenefactor, uncle and brother-in-law of the first deity and brother of the\n\nsecond who mysteriously watched over the living Taino and could dispense\n\nintercessions and blessings.\n Other important deities evolved from the ancestral and creation\n\nstories with specific names and powers.\n The pantheon was completed by the one to ten zemis manifested in all\n\nliving things and who could be contacted by depiction.\n These depictions themselves were transformed into zemis and could\n\nprovide replacements for the flora and fauna consumed as food. \n\n  Associated with religious duties and their observance were\n\nceremonies and rituals, incorporating  areitos  ( songs and dances\n\nin established forms), customs and traditions relative to various illnesses,\n\nfamine, drought, prosperity, death, interment, the seasons, lunar and solar\n\ncycles etc. and intended to express supplication or gratification.\n ceremony.\n The content of the rituals was related to the purpose and all were\n\nconducted at carefully prescribed venues such as the  zemi bohio  ,\n\nthe abode of the  bohuti/boyez  , the ca&ccedille;ique\'s  bohio\n\n , the dwelling of the  \'god-king/queen\'  who also\n\nfunctioned as principal shaman.\n Other venues were particular natural places such as blue or ocean\n\nhole on land and under water and marked boulders or caves, wet or dry,\n\nspecially associated with the principal female deity.\n Within these natural sites, and oriented usually towards the rising\n\nsun, the principal male deity and the ancestral home, could be placed any of\n\nan assemblage of sacred objects including duhos, the bodies of the \n\nnitaino  , pictographs, petroglyphs, canoes and oars, and carved\n\nanthropomorphic, zoomorphic and zoological zemis representing the principal\n\nand minor deities. \n\n  ceremony, would take\n\nplace in a venue with preparations, accoutrements and participants\n\nappropriate to the significance of the occasion.\n , the principals,\n\nwould abstain from food and other bodily pleasures for days beforehand.\n Adorning themselves in full regalia, including feathered headdresses,\n\ncapes and jewellery, with bodies intricately painted primarily in red, black\n\nand white patterns, they would use vomiting spatulae to void their stomachs.\n\n\nin the form of snuff in a receptacle raised above a zemi, and having lit it,\n\namidst appropriate  areitos  , would draw the smoke up their\n\nnostrils directly to the brain using a  tabaco  , the forked nose\n\npipe.\n Hallucinogenic trances were thus induced during the ceremony which\n\ncould takes hours.\n Communication with the deities could ensue, often resulting in\n\nprophecy. \n\n \n\n  Each of the principal deities had a number of names and name\n\ncombinations, as well as associated sub-deities, relative to aspects of their\n\npowers.\n These names have been preserved for us largely through writings in\n\nEuropean languages, and especially English and Spanish, so the orthographies\n\nused here are derived from those early works.\n , usually shown with\n\n( at least stylized) male genitalia, with ( at least partially) outstretched\n\nlegs, with arms akimbo or laid to the sides or flat across the mid- torso,\n\noften with some kind of headdress, often adorned with some clothing and\n\njewellery, with exaggerated eye sockets and mouths designed for insets to\n\nseal these body openings, and sometimes also with pigmentation.\n The figure of Yocahuna could be used to dignify a composite\n\nutilitarian piece, such as Object A, a staff of office, or a vomiting\n\nspatula, a stone collar or a belt.\n The image could also consist of a head alone, head and torso or full\n\nbody, forming more than one image on the sides of the  \'prayer-stones\'\n\n or  \'three-pointed stones\'  .\n\n\nand

The SDC is responsible\n\nfor the Special Training and Empowerment Programme, which provides training\n\nfor employment for the age group 17-24 who are neither employed nor enrolled\n\nin a formal training institution; the community development programme; family\n\ncentres and youth clubs islandwide. \n\n  A new programme, Strategy for the Rehabilitation of the Inner\n\nCity through Viable Enterprises ( STRIVE) is geared to provide viable\n\neconomic enterprises and better social services for inner city residents\n\nthrough projects run by the residents themselves. \n\n  During 1996, additional programmes aimed at improving the lives\n\nof children, youth, women and communities were launched by the\n\nGovernment. These include: \n\n  - The National Plan of Action for Children - this focuses on the\n\nsurvival, protection and development of children. \n\n  - SKILLS 2000 aimed at training individuals with special needs\n\nand also Food Stamp beneficiaries and their family members to acquire\n\nself- employment. \n\n  - The Jamaica Social Investment Fund ( JSIF), a project under the\n\nNational Poverty Eradication Programme, which makes funds accessible for\n\ncommunity development. \n\n \n\n  Both public and private sectors are engaged in the provision of\n\nhousing in Jamaica. \n\n  In 1975 the Government established the National Housing\n\nCorporation ( NHC) and National Housing Trust ( NHT) to accelerate\n\nhousing development. \n\n  ( NHT) is funded by a combination of personal and corporate\n\ncontributions through salary deductions.\n The NHT Act requires that all employees over eighteen years, and\n\ntheir employers, make contributions to the Trust.\n\n\n  Employers are required to deduct 2 per cent of each employee\'s\n\nsalary along with 3 per cent of their own wage bill and remit funds to the\n\nNHT on a monthly basis.\n Self-employed persons contribute 2 per cent or 3 per cent of\n\nearnings, depending on the occupational category in which they fall. \n\n  These contributions are used by NHT to finance the construction\n\nof houses and to provide mortgage loans for contributors who wish to\n\npurchase, build, repair their houses or to purchase land. \n\n  The Ministry of Environment and Housing, through its joint\n\nventure programme, works with public and private sector entities to invest\n\nand provide affordable housing units and serviced lots for Jamaican families.\n\n\n\n \n\n  The number of persons living below the poverty line decreased\n\nfrom nearly 50 per cent in 1991 to 28.4 per cent in 1997.\n These figures are from the latest survey on Living Conditions carried\n\nout by the Statistical Institute of Jamaica ( STATIN) and the Planning\n\nInstitute of Jamaica ( PIOJ). \n\n  Living conditions improved over the period 1989-1994.\n STATIN data showed an 8 per cent increase in the number of squatters.\n Electricity supply to homes went up from 67 per cent to 75 per\n\ncent of the population during this period and flush toilets are now\n\ninstalled in 75 per cent of homes across the island. \n\n \n\n  Medical services are provided by twenty-four government-funded\n\ngeneral hospitals.\n Six specialist hospitals provide treatment for mental illness, polio,\n\nrespiratory illness, pre- and post-natal care for infants.\n Among the health training facilities, are a teaching hospital,\n\none poly-clinic, and a Dental Auxiliary school which trains nurses and\n\nassistants specifically in the area of dentistry.\n In addition, there are 371 health centres and several private\n\nhospitals and nursing homes. \n\n  Inoculation programmes against childhood diseases, including diph\n\n<l> theria, whooping cough, tetanus, tuberculosis and poliomyelitis are\n\ncarried out periodically.\n Public health regulations have also been introduced to control\n\npollution.\n Since 1992, there have been no reported cases of poliomyelitis,\n\nmeasles, cholera, or diphtheria. \n\n  In 1996 two important initiatives were launched by the Ministry\n\nof Health: \n\n \n\n \n\n  The JADEP will increase the affordability of persons sixty (\n\n60) years and over in the purchase of drugs used in the treatment of chronic\n\ndiseases such as diabetes, glaucoma, asthma, arthritis and hypertension. \n\n  The new legislation will increase the accessibility, efficiency\n\nand quality of Mental Health Services offered throughout the island. \n\n \n\n  The Ministry of Education, Youth and Culture has overall\n\nresponsibility for policy direction of education, youth and culture.\n Tuition is heavily subsidized at the primary and secondary\n\nlevels.\n A number of schools are run by churches and private groups and many\n\nreceive subsidies from government. \n\n  Students at the primary level gain access to secondary education\n\neither by automatic promotion to secondary schools, all-age, junior high, new\n\nsecondary and comprehensive high schools, or by selection to secondary high,\n\nand comprehensive high schools through the Common Entrance Examinations (\n\nCEE).\n This examination is to be phased out by 1998 and will be\n\nreplaced in 1999 by a curriculum based National Assessment Programme (\n\nNAP). \n\n  Reform of Secondary Education ( ROSE) is a five year project (\n\n1993-98) designed to lead to improvements in secondary education in the first\n\nphase for all students in grades 7-9 ( 12-15 yrs.), and in the second phase,\n\nfor all students in grades 10-11 ( 16-18 yrs.). \n\n  To date, approximately 20,000 students in 65 schools have been\n\nexposed to the newly developed curriculum.\n A number of in-service and pre-training workshops have been held\n\nfor teachers, student teachers and college lecturers under this\n\nprogramme. \n\n  Tertiary education is offered by the University of the West\n\nIndies ( a regional institution); the University of Technology; the Edna\n\nManley College for the Visual and Performing Arts ( which combines schools of\n\nart, dance, drama and music); College of Agriculture, Science and Education (\n\nCASE); G.C. Foster College of Physical Education and Sports and twelve\n\nteacher training colleges.\n There are also fourteen community colleges, a dental auxiliary\n\nschool, a Vocational Training Development Institute and twenty-nine\n\nvocational training centres.\n There are also six vocational training institutions operated by\n\nHuman Employment and Resource Training/ National Training Agency (\n\nHEART/NTA). \n\n  Since the 1970s, the Jamaican Movement for the Advancement of\n\nLiteracy ( JAMAL), has been working to eradicate adult illiteracy.\n Over the last seven years, some 113,878 persons have enrolled in\n\nits classes islandwide.\n\n\ners, supported by a network of volunteers.\n The success of JAMAL and other educational programmes was reflected\n\nin a survey done in 1994 which revealed that 75.4 per cent of all Jamaicans\n\nare literate. \n\n \n\n  Historically, the Jamaican economy has had an agricultural base,\n\ndependent on a few staple export crops, primarily sugar and\n\nbananas.\n mining ( after\n\n1952), and the tourism boom in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n\n  The international recession which occurred in the mid-1970s,\n\nhowever, adversely affected economic growth. \n\n  Jamaica\'s economic stabilization and adjustment process, which\n\nbegan in the 1980s, advanced significantly during the 1990s as the stages of\n\nderegulation and liberalization were accelerated.\n\n\nket, market determined interest rates, removal of price controls on goods,\n\nelimination of subsidies, lowering of fiscal borrowing requirements, and\n\nincreasing the pace of privatization of government-owned entities. \n\n  The main impetus for economic growth has come from expansion in\n\nthe tourism industry, rehabilitation of export in agriculture, recovery in\n\nthe bauxite/alumina industry ( after a setback in the 1980s) and in the ser\n\n<l> vice sectors. \n\n In 1996, the economy grew by 1.7 per cent, agriculture 3.3 per cent, and\n\nmining 7.5. per cent. \n\n \n\n  In September 1995, Jamaica successfully terminated eighteen\n\nyears of a borrowing relationship with The International Monetary Fund. \n\n \n\n  " The National Industrial\n\nPolicy \x13 A Strategic Plan for Economic Growth and Development"  was\n\npresented through Parliament to the nation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  The Policy has set specific targets for economic growth and\n\ntargeted strategic clusters for development towards the 21st century\n\nover a 15 year period. \n\n \n\n  administers the banking and\n\nmonetary system.\n facilitates the\n\ndevelopment of housing and small business loan organizations.\n There are eleven commercial banks and twenty-nine merchant banks of\n\nwhich six operate as merchant and trust banks and one operates as a trust\n\ncompany only.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '3cc74575-db33-4d4a-8246-3a120aa57e27', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.399500+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9616801738739014, 'non_english_score': 0.03831982612609863}
{'text': 'UNLESS much greater attention is paid to encouraging parents to\n\ntake a keener interest in the upbringing of their children, our hope of one\n\nday having an adequately educated and trained Jamaican society will most\n\nlikely remain an unrealised dream. \n\n  Over the last six decades, or so, there has been a growing\n\nawareness among us that the first few years of life are particularly\n\ncrucial to the individual\'s education.\n It was largely for that reason that during the 1930s certain members\n\nof the Legislative Council pleaded so earnestly with the Director\n\nof Education for additional infant school places; and it is this more\n\nthan any other factor, which accounts for today\'s nearly 2,000 basic schools\n\nscattered all over the country. \n\n  In the meantime, however, the study of child development has\n\nprogressed apace and we now know that once a baby is born it begins to\n\ninteract with its environment.\n During the period between birth and the beginning of schooling parents\n\nhave an extremely sensitive role to play in enhancing the child\'s devel <l>\n\nopment.\n For at this early stage the infant is so very impressionable and\n\nimitative and possesses such an active and retentive mind that learning\n\noccurs rapidly and what is learned can be subsequently unlearned only\n\nwith difficulty. \n\n  Recently a medical doctor and a team of nurses, engaged in\n\nconducting a clinic, were not a little surprised at the tirade of obscenities\n\nthat issued from the mouth of a two-year-old boy when injected against his\n\nwill.\n Some of the words he could not pronounce properly but that did not\n\ndeter him from using them.\n If this rate of learning is maintained, this child will have a\n\nconsiderable speaking vocabulary by age four when preschooling\n\nbegins; but, alas, much of it will not be supportive of his development. \n\n  It would surely pay good dividends if parents were continual\n\n<l> ly reminded of the extent to which they influence their children\'s\n\nbehaviour by what they do and say at home.\n They need always to be conscious that it is mostly from them that the\n\nlittle ones get their first rudimentary understandings of love or hate,\n\nkindness or cruelty, forgiveness or revenge, truthfulness or deception,\n\namong other basic characteristics.\n Briefly put, it is the home that begins the socialisation and\n\nhumanisation of the child and therefore its environment should be of\n\ngood quality. \n\n  This is not to say, of course, that no external factor impacts on\n\nthe child at this stage; but it is the responsibility of parents, while\n\nencouraging what is good, to strive to minimise the influence of\n\nundesirable extraneous interference whether it comes from the neighbours,\n\nother members of the community, the radio, television or video. \n\n  It is regrettable, to say the least, that many knowledgeable\n\npeople are so little concerned with the connection between one\'s experiences\n\nduring these first few years and the conception of life and attitude to\n\nsociety one later demonstrates as an adult. \n\n  In considering the shortcomings of a disadvantaged home,\n\nmany an educator first of all bemoans the absence of literature and\n\nother amenities that stimulate the infant\'s readiness for formal learning.\n Most naturally, this early readiness is quite an advantage if\n\nthe circumstances make it possible; but where they don\'t with good\n\nteaching and regular attendance this is soon achieved at school.\n More fundamental than this, however, is that socio-moral orientation\n\nwhich needs to be started early and which good parents can initiate even\n\nin poor economic circumstances. \n\n \n\nity of the institution, some parents seem to feel relieved of the baton\n\nand consequently less responsible for the youngster\'s growth and\n\ndevelopment.\n Counsellors on parenting therefore need to emphasise to both\n\nmothers and fathers that their duty here entails much more than helping\n\nwith homework.\n and cooperating\n\nwith the school that parents can best keep informed about the child\'s needs,\n\nthe progress being made and the ways in which they can help the teachers to\n\nprocure equipment for the most effective delivery of the educational pro <l>\n\ngramme. \n\n \n\n \n\nmony and resolve to do the best for their offspring, will always be the\n\nideal; but there is an accelerating increase in the prevalence of\n\nsingle-parent homes not only here in Jamaica but also in many parts of the\n\ndeveloped world.\n It would be folly to pretend that nothing is lost when a parent is\n\nmissing from the home, but it is gratifying to note that in more than a few\n\ninstances a single parent provides sufficient love, devotion and security to\n\nmake the child happy, and guides its social and educational development\n\nwith pride and success. \n\n  " fathers"\n\n her child but rarely, if ever, is there any mention of the father\n\nwho  " mothers  his child.\n Undoubtedly fathers outnumber mothers in the neglect of their\n\nparental duties; but the cause is surely not helped when no recognition is\n\ngiven to those fathers who faithfully stand by their children and give of\n\ntheir best to them. \n\n  A frequent weakness of the child\'s early education is the blatant\n\nfailure of the two-parent home to make it obvious that mother and father are\n\nequally important and should be treated with equal respect and affection.\n\n\n\n \n\n  It is only human that in some instances there will be a leaning\n\nto either of the two, but children should not be allowed to perceive\n\nthat their parents are in some kind of competition for their preference. \n\n  Early filial awareness of parental equality is essential to\n\nthe best development of the child for it is from this point that he can most\n\neasily proceed to the concept that all people are important and deserve\n\nto be accorded dignity and respect.\n And subsumed by this concept is the supreme moral value of the\n\nsanctity of all human life. \n\n  How much longer, therefore, will society continue to weaken the\n\nfabric of the home by unwittingly helping to foster the inequality\n\nof parents?\n When shall we cease celebrating separate days for Mothers and Fathers\n\nand have instead a united celebration for parents?\n It is surely not the work of either mother or father alone but the\n\ncollaborative endeavour of both that produces the best results.\n Of this fact, children, parents and the society at large need to be\n\ncognisant.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  SOME CHILDREN\'S homes may be forced to close their doors\n\nsoon.\n it\'s\n\n</- >  its   operations"  , while others are finding it\n\nincreasingly difficult to care for abused and neglected children.\n\n \n\n  Administrators at the homes are gearing up for the next round of\n\nincreases, expected to send up the prices on a number of basic commodities.\n\n\n\n  " instant headache"\n\n when news of the adjustments to the General Consumption Tax ( GCT)\n\nwas announced. \n\n  The supervisors at these homes have painted a picture of woe,\n\nrevealing problems of little funding, late arrival of cheques, dormitories in\n\nneed of repairs and hostility to some of the children at these homes, by\n\nmembers of the public living nearby and in adjoining communities. \n\n  " total\n\nresponsibility"  for 17 homes, nine of which are Places of Safety and\n\nthe remainder being seven Children\'s Home. \n\n  In addition, the division supervises 29 private homes across\n\nthe island. \n\n  The Blossom Gardens Child Care Centre, on Coke Avenue, Montego\n\nBay, is one of the homes where the workers are faced with insurmountable\n\nodds.\n " with a little cutting and\n\ncarving"  they manage to keep the doors open. \n\n  " bursting at the seams"\n\n as a direct result of having to cater for about 20 more children\n\nthan it can accommodate." \n\n  "\n\nthere is now a definite need for more funding."  \n\n  The home gets a weekly grant from government which buys mostly\n\nfood.\n However, there are a number of other items which are in constant\n\ndemand.\n\n\n  " For thirty it would be enough, for fifty it is\n\nimpossible"  says the secretary.\n The home was forced to cut back staff due to govern <l  \n\n<ment\'s inability to pay those staffers.  \n\n  The staff at the home now consists of seven government nurse\n\n -  maids, a cook, washer, cleaner, nurse, secretary and the superin\n\n<l> tendent. \n\n  Help has been forthcoming from a number of donors such as the\n\nJamaica National Building Society and Janet Madden a resident in the\n\narea, however, there is need for more. \n\n  " We try to meet the need of all the children, stretching\n\nthe dollar, but wherever it magga it pop, we have to concentrate mainly on\n\nthe babies as half of the children are under two years old.  " \n\n \n\n  " The staffers are trying, we love the children, they are\n\nnice. What must we do?  "   Mrs Clemetson cried. \n\n  Hanbury Children\'s Home in Shooters Hill, Mandeville has been the\n\nvictim of  " late cheques"  , according to Major Rudolph\n\nRichards, supervisor at this home. \n\n  Cheques are said to be reaching sometimes as late as a month\n\nand a half past the due date. \n\n  " April and May cheque come in June, when we get that\n\nmoney it is long spent". \n The home is forced to take goods on credit and at times it is put in\n\nan embarrassing position, as goods taken is not paid for in time. \n\n  The\n\n$60,000    allotted   is primarily used to\n\nbuy food while money from donors goes towards paying salaries, Richards said.\n\n\n\n  Another problem facing the home, Richards pointed out was the\n\nabuse of the children by some members of the community. \n\n  " Children in children\'s homes are under a whole lot of\n\npressure." \n One example was the behaviour of teachers towards these children.\n\n\n\n \n\n  " Teachers are not sympathetic with these children at\n\nschool, and this creates hostility and animosity in their disposition"\n\n . \n\n  " if\n\nsomething is not done it\'s a just a matter of time before they unleash their\n\nanimosity on the society."  \n\n  Lyndale Girls Home, in St Mary is finding it hard to feed the\n\ngirls housed there.\n The home receives\n\n$420 per month per child.\n , responded executive\n\nsecretary Morris Richards who is responsible for day-to-day spend <l>\n\ning at the home. \n\n  " as a serious\n\ndilemma drawing to near bankruptcy, we are appealing for help".  \n\n  The situation at these homes is similar in nature, some even\n\nworse.\n At one home located in Upper St Andrew, girls are lured by men who\n\nengage them in sexual activities. \n\n  Some of the men live in the area, while some come from as far as\n\ndowntown Kingston,   The Jamaica Observer   learnt.\n\n\n\n  Security is poor at these institutions, one source pointed\n\nout  " especially in these Girl\'s Home it is pathetic"  . \n\n  Desmond Chambers, Deputy Director at the Children\'s Services\n\nDivision ( CSD) with responsibility for institutions, was unable to say how\n\nmuch money was allocated to the CSD. \n\n  supervisors\n\nof cheques arriving late, Chambers said some homes were guilty of submitting\n\ntheir reimbursements late, as they were not following the division\'s\n\ntimetable in submitting the receipts. \n\n  " extra funds"\n\n is receiving favourable response and that it is being considered."\n\n\n\n  Turning to improvements, Chambers said government has embarked on\n\na programme of deinstitutionalising children\'s homes. \n\n  This is a project geared towards providing foster homes for chil\n\n<l> dren who are now in government homes. \n\n  success, Chambers\n\nsaid the progress could not yet be measured as it was still in    its   initial stages.\n As soon as the project is on stream, indications are that there\n\nwill be improvements in the system, he said. \n\n  There are 1,858 children in homes across the island, 1,033 in\n\nprivate homes, and 552 in government homes. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  ZEAL without wisdom, a wise old uncle of mine used to say, is a\n\nvery dangerous thing. \n\n  " The\n\nDisadvantaged Child"  as the focus of this year\'s observation of\n\nChild Month \x13 May.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '4f5e5fb6-02d3-4a12-ae5d-a255179cea77', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.400989+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9786465764045715, 'non_english_score': 0.021353423595428467}

passengers\n\nnever had to wait long for the trams to meet. \n\n \n\n  Nowadays you never know when you\'ll get a black-out or a\n\nbrown-out; and unless you chivvy the emergency crews by telephone,\n\nsome areas are neglected for long periods. \n\n \n\nrent.\n If you moved out to the country towns with electrical appliances\n\nsuch as refrigerators and record-changers you had to have adjustments made,\n\nsometimes involving transformers.\n However, the country towns were in line with North America, in\n\nthat they had 60-cycle current at 110 volts.\n When the change- over came, the powers that be decreed that everybody\n\nshould convert to 50-cycle equipment.\n , with\n\nproblems if certain types of 60-cycle equipment are brought here from\n\nNorth America, and unable to use the 50-cycle equipment common in\n\nEurope, since the voltage there is usually 220 volts. \n\n  In addition to all this, every consumer had to foot the bill for\n\nfrequency conversion, which need not have been implemented outside the\n\nCorporate Area. \n\n  " energy\n\ncharge"  in addition to some horrendously high bills for\n\nkilowatts consumed.\n Could this happen in Europe or North America?\n Would passengers anywhere put up with taxi drivers charging them for\n\ndistance and time, and adding a cost for the fuel used?\n really is defensible, many\n\nof us need re  -  educating in accountancy and business in general.\n\n\n\n  Furthermore, the late Utilities Minister Wilton Hill spear\n\n<l> headed legislation exonerating the JPSCo in cases where  equipment is damaged through voltage surges or drops.\n Many people have lost refrigeration equipment, including\n\nair-conditioning units, this way.\n Nor does the JPSCo consider itself responsible for spoilage of food\n\nor other perishable supplies when it fails to deliver current for reasons\n\nother than  " acts of God"  such as hurricanes and\n\nearthquakes, or accidents which involve utility poles.\n In metropolitan countries the company would certainly find\n\nitself in court for failure to deliver the current it is under contract to\n\nsupply. \n\n  Then there is the matter of shares which were offered to the\n\npublic for subscription many years ago.\n There was a stage at which it seemed that the government of the\n\nday intended to buy these all back.\n Anyway, these shares have been split and watered and may\n\neventually end up as broth of some kind.\n But one thing does not happen: shareholders do not get dividends\n\nup to now.\n Maybe somebody should tell the company that there are only seven\n\nyears left in this century! \n\n \n\n  Back in 1958 when the Mona Heights housing scheme was about to\n\nbegin taking shape, the developers made much of the intention not to have a\n\nforest of utility poles  " uglifying"  the area.\n\n\ncerned that some high-tension cables may be a health hazard, the company\'s\n\nattitude up to now is more or less:  " We\'ll do our own thing; you\n\njust pay up and shut up!"  \n\n  On Belvedere Road, between the end of Belvedere Crescent and the\n\nentrance to Happy Grove and Plantation Heights, there are about half a dozen\n\nsmall humps right across the road.\n They are not the work of the Water Commission.\n They are shallow trenches dug by people who have been stealing\n\nelectric current ever since the ancient-history days when Pearnel\n\nCharles was Minister of Utilities.\n To my certain knowledge their existence has been brought to the\n\nattention of several people inside the JPSCo head office or working for the\n\ncompany.\n "\n\nfreeness"  is either passed on to legitimate consumers or contributes\n\nto the company\'s failure to pay dividends to shareholders. \n\n  How hollow is the ring to the company\'s radio and television\n\nassurances that  " We DO care!"   \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  DURING the 1993 sectoral debate the Government promised,\n\nonce again, to remove the Suppression of Crime Act.\n We have waited patiently, but, to date, the Act continues.\n Is there any rational reason, justification or explanation for the\n\ncontinuation of this insidious and deleterious piece of legislation?\n The Wolfe Report has strongly urged its immediate repeal and referred\n\nto it as of  " dubious constitutionality"  .\n In numerous articles, I have tried to demonstrate the harmful effect\n\nand corrupting influence of the Act. \n\n \n\nject to further abuses and the violation of human rights continue\n\nunabatedly under the protection of the Suppression of Crime Act.\n Could it be that the Government recognises that it cannot\n\nafford to repeal the Act immediately since it would open itself to massive\n\ncivil actions by citizens who are harassed and humiliated daily by the\n\npolice?\n Maybe, the government acknowledges that the police has developed\n\nwhat the Wolfe Report has described as a  " Suppression of\n\nCrime Culture"  and does not know how to deal with it.\n , and will not\n\nallow the government to repeal the Act? \n\n  It is obvious that the inordinate power which the Suppres\n\n<l> sion of Crime Act gives to the police has not been used effectively\n\nto suppress crime.\n Instead it has been misused on a wide scale by corrupt police\n\nofficers for devious and selfish purposes.\n Moreover, police operations under the Act are enthusiastically\n\nconducted without proper regard for the due process of law, and the\n\nrights and privileges of the ordinary citizens. \n\n  Police officers have become so accustomed to the use and abuse of\n\ntheir powers that they no longer consider their oppressive behaviour to\n\nbe wrong and harmful.\n The police must be aware that they are being assessed and\n\nscrutinised.\n\n\nduct was exposed and severely condemned.\n The Police Complaints Authority came into operation to\n\nexamine complaints from the public in matters of police misbehaviour. \n\n \n\n  The airwaves and newsprint are constantly discussing and\n\ncriticising the behaviour of the police.\n Yet, in spite of such strong and sharp criticism of their improper\n\nconduct, they continue to use brute force, harassment and terror to\n\nengage the ordinary citizen. \n\n  Too many police officers behave as if they are above the\n\nlaw.\n It appears that they administer, and are governed by, laws which\n\nare different from the laws of the land.\n They are so power drunk that they consider it to be an outrage and an\n\nact of ungratefulness for the society to even question their excessive be <l>\n\nhaviour. \n\n  The shooting of a family\'s dog, and then to laugh because the\n\nhousewife is in tears, is an act of barbarism which demeans and further\n\nblemishes the image of the force.\n To kill apprehended criminals is comparable to genocide.\n To arrest and jail innocent young men is a gross abuse of power and a\n\nblatant violation of the men\'s constitutional rights.\n It is indeed perilous for the ordinary citizen to even question\n\nthe authority of a police officer, even where the officer is clearly wrong,\n\nsince the inevitable consequence is that brute force and harassment will\n\nfollow. \n\n  More and more it becomes clear that our police force is a part of\n\nthe problem of crime rather than a part of its solution.\n We must change this festering sore of police misconduct and excesses\n\nnow.\n The tyrannical behaviour which has become the habit of too many\n\npolicemen must cease.\n\n\n  Uncontrolled power creates tyrants.\n It is not that our police officers are wicked and evil men.\n It is the culture which corrupts them.\n Police officers in England, U.S.A., indeed everywhere, abuse their\n\npower and behave in a similar manner where their power is unchecked.\n History is replete with examples of tyrants who abused their\n\nextraordinary power.\n " Power corrupts, and absolute power\n\ncorrupts absolutely."  \n\n \n\n  ,\n\neloquently portrays the problem of power. He states: \n\n  " Whoever has experienced the power, the unrestrained\n\nability to humiliate another human being & automatically loses power\n\nover his own sensations.\n Tyranny is a habit, it has its own organic life, it develops\n\nfinally into a disease.\n The habit can kill and coarsen the very best man to the level of a\n\nbeast.\n Blood and power intoxicate & The man and the citizen die with the\n\ntyrant forever; the return to human dignity, to repentance to regeneration,\n\nbecomes almost impossible."  \n\n  The genesis of the problem, I repeat and emphasize, can be found\n\nin the    Suppression   of Crime Act.\n It is the system which is at fault.\n I know too many good and decent policemen to believe that they\n\nare all bad eggs in the Force.\n But, the system gives too much power to the tyrants to harass and\n\nhumiliate their fellow men.\n They exercise their power, sanctioned by legislation of dubious\n\nconstitutionality, without sufficient checks and balances.\n Police officers, with firearms at the ready, cannot be seriously chal\n\n<l> lenged.\n Commands must be obeyed, humiliation endured and bitterness and\n\nhatred inevitably follow.\n The dignity and sacredness of the human person are assaulted, and\n\ninevitably the society suffers. \n\n \n\ntiveness or failure of the Suppression of Crime Act?\n Yet, we compound the problem by adding more policy initiatives\n\nsuch as the Eradication Squad, Ardent, ACID, etc., without any obvious and\n\nlasting benefit.\n These policy initiative rest precariously on the principle that\n\ncrime-fighting is best pursued by instilling and inspiring fear in the minds\n\nof criminals.\n The assumption that by inspiring fear then criminals will cower\n\nand avoid illegitimate activity is fraught with danger.\n which is being\n\npractised where the don wields such tyrannical power that no one dares to\n\ndisobey his dictates.\n Such strategy clearly represents the law of tyrannical states where\n\naction is suppressed by fear and power is used to brutalise and to\n\nanaesthetize.\n No one can deny that such methods are features of many police\n\nforces, and must occasionally be used. \n\n \n\n  But must they be the main, perhaps the only, techniques of our\n\npolice force?\n Surely, Dostoevsky is right when he asserts that tyranny is a\n\nhabit.\n We can see, in our police force that it has developed into a\n\ndisease.\n Let us act now by repealing the Suppression of Crime Act, and\n\nabandoning ACID or other tyrannical task forces. \n\n  Civilised societies cannot develop and flourish in an atmo\n\n<l> sphere of fear.\n Our citizens are not only afraid of criminals but they also fear the\n\npolice.\n Fear is crippling our daily lives.\n And, the police has a major role to play in lowering the level of\n\nfear in every community.\n To examine and implement a new policy direction for effective\n\ncommunity policing is the most important task that confronts\n\nColonel Trevor MacMillan as he assumes the role of Commissioner of Po <l>\n\nlice.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '737e4547-c8b9-4e72-88d2-049ba5ed4f6a', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.402473+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9722648859024048, 'non_english_score': 0.027735114097595215}
{'text': 'The BROWN PELICAN or OLD JOE as it is called locally, can be\n\nseen often if you live by the sea; they will sometimes fly inland to feed at\n\nfish farms or reservoirs.\n It is a big bird, between 45 to 55 inches ( about 105 cm) in length,\n\nwith a stocky, squat body, short tail and legs; the wings are broad and\n\nrounded.\n The bill is long and hooked at the tip and below is a large pouch of\n\nskin which gives this bird a most unusual appearance. \n\n  Pelicans are often seen flying low over the water, one after the\n\nother, flapping their wings slowly and with their heads drawn back into the\n\nshoulders. \n\n  They are a brownish-grey in colour, but in the breeding season the\n\nplumage becomes a much richer brown.\n Adults have a white streak running from the top of the head down the\n\nsides of the neck.\n\n\n  Pelicans feed on fish, diving for their food often from a great\n\nheight.\n They scoop up the fish in the large, pouched bill and when they\n\nsurface toss the fish up and swallow it.\n Pelicans make untidy nests in low bushes or on the ground, laying two\n\nor three white eggs.  \n\n \n\n  The FRIGATE BIRD is commonly seen soaring high above fishing\n\nbeaches, Kingston Harbour, or along the coast.\n It is a magnificent flyer and has exceptionally strong flight muscles\n\nin its angled wings. \n\n  The male is some 40 inches long ( 90 cm) and is a glossy black\n\nall over.\n The tail is deeply forked and opens and shuts like a pair of scissors\n\nwhen the bird is in flight.\n In the breeding season the male inflates a red pouch at its neck.\n The female is slightly larger than the male, browner in colour, and\n\nhas a white breast.\n\n\n  The Frigate bird feeds by attacking other fish-eating birds so\n\nthat they disgorge their catch which the Frigate bird then seizes \x13 a habit\n\nwhich has earned them the name MAN-OF- WAR BIRD.\n Frigate birds must catch the disgorged fish before it touches\n\nthe water as this bird is unable to rise off the surface of the sea and\n\nwould quickly become waterlogged and die. \n\n  They build very rough, platform-like nests on a low bush or rock\n\nand lay only one egg.  \n\n \n\n  The RED-TAILED HAWK, or CHICKEN HAWK, is generally seen\n\nsoaring high in the sky and it is sometimes mistaken for a John Crow, but it\n\nhas a much broader tail and a slightly smaller wing span. \n\n  This is a bird of prey and it feeds mostly on rats, mice and\n\nsmall birds which it catches in its talons, swooping down on them often from\n\na great height.\n It may also attack chickens and some people in the rural areas kill\n\nthe hawk because of this.\n If trees are grown around the chicken-runs the hawk will not get\n\nthrough.\n Its cry is easy to distinguish, being a rasping scream or whistle.\n\n\n\n  It is large bird, nearly 2 feet ( 60 cm) long.\n The upper parts are dark brown and the under parts much paler\n\nand streaked with black, the breast white.\n\n\n  The Red-tailed Hawk nests in a tree or on a rocky shelf.\n illustration\n\n\n\n \n\n  The SPARROW HAWK, or KESTREL, known locally as the KILLY-KILLY,\n\nwas at one time rarely seen in Jamaica, except in the western parishes, but,\n\nover the past 40 years it has spread east and may now often be seen in towns.\n It feeds on insects, lizards and sometimes small birds.\n\n\n  The Sparrow Hawk is 12 inches ( 30 cm) long, rather rufous on\n\nback and tail with underparts generally white or spotted with black; the male\n\nhas dark blue-black wings.\n The bill is sharp and hooked, and a dark line above the eye and down\n\nthe face is easily seen when the bird is perched.\n Sparrow Hawks nest in the cavity of a tree or in a building.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  GROUND DOVES can be seen all over the island, except in the\n\nhigh mountain forest.\n They may often be found walking in pairs, or in family groups of\n\nthree or four.\n They have pink feet and legs and a rather waddling way of walking.\n\n\n\n  This is a plump, small bird, only 5 ½ inches ( 14 cm) long.\n The plumage is a lovely pinkish brown, greyer on the back; the\n\nunderparts are pinker and the dark edges to the feathers give them a rather\n\nscaly look; the wings and tail are a darker reddish brown.\n\n\n  " woop,\n\nwoop, woop!"  \n\n \n\n \n\n  The big, white owl is called the BARN OWL and is found over the\n\nisland, even in towns.\n They hunt for their food at night, so one hears them more often than\n\none sees them.\n Their call is a strange, creaking sound, and sometimes a harsh\n\nscreech, which is why their local name is the SCREECH OWL. \n\n  Many people do not like to see or hear this bird for they believe\n\nthat they will bring bad luck!\n But these birds are really very useful as they eat mice and rats, and\n\nso to try to kill or harm them is a mistake. \n\n  The Barn Owl is over a foot ( 30 cm), in length, with white\n\nplumage, a short tail and rounded wings.\n The head is large and a ruff of soft feathers around the eyes makes\n\nthe face appear flat.\n\n\n  These birds roost and nest in ruined buildings, in the cavity of\n\na dead tree or on a ledge in a cave.\n\n\n \n\n  There is another owl to be seen in Jamaica which is of special\n\ninterest because it is found nowhere else in the world.\n\n\n  Town dwellers will be very lucky if they see this bird as it\n\nlives mostly in the country parts.\n Jamaican owls become quite tame, and often, for weeks on end,\n\nwill use the same place on which to perch, sometimes quite close to a house\n\nor cottage. \n\n  The Jamaican Owl is a foot ( 30 cm) long; its feathers are tawny\n\nbrown with black and dark brown specks.\n The plumage on the back is darker.\n The feathers on the top of the head stick up and form what appears to\n\nbe two ears.\n The cry of this owl can be quite frightening: it is a deep, hoarse\n\n " whow!"   \n\n \n\n  Humming birds are found only in the New World, and of these,\n\nthree kinds occur only in Jamaica. \n\n  The MANGO HUMMING BIRD is found only in Jamaica, but is far less\n\noften seen than the other kinds of humming birds for it occurs mostly in\n\nthe country areas and not in town gardens.\n They may frequently be seen feeding at the banana blossoms; they\n\ntend to build their nests far higher in a tree than do the other humming\n\nbirds.\n They defend their nests fiercely, driving off any bird or animal (\n\nincluding human), that gets too close, by flying at them with their sharp,\n\nstrong, beaks. \n\n  They are small birds, 6 inches ( 15 cm) long, but sturdier\n\nthan the Streamer Tail.\n The plumage in both sexes is the same \x13 a somewhat metallic, bronzy\n\npurple; the underparts and head are black and the broad tail has some red\n\nfeathers in it, visible as the bird hovers to feed and the tail is spread.\n In poor light the whole bird may appear black.\n\n\n \n\n  The STREAMER TAIL HUMMING BIRD, or DOCTOR BIRD as it is locally\n\nknown, is Jamaica\'s National Bird.\n The male is very lovely, the female a good deal drabber in colour.\n These birds may be seen in town gardens, in the country, in the high\n\nmountains and even by the sea.\n They feed off nectar and tiny insects and flit from blossom to\n\nblossom in search of food.\n They are pugnacious birds and the males engage in savage fights over\n\nterritory.\n " tee! tee!\n\ntee!" \n The male has two long black tail feathers and when the bird is in\n\nflight these produce an easily-heard humming sound. \n\n  These humming birds are very small, about 4 ½ inches ( 13 cm)\n\nlong; the breast is a brilliant green with the rest of the body a duller\n\ngreen and the head black.\n The bill is red except in birds from the very eastern end of the\n\nisland which have black bills.\n Young males lack the long tail feathers.\n Females have pale green upper parts and white breast and underparts;\n\nthey, too, lack the long tail feathers.\n These birds make tiny nests of down and fibres, often rather low on a\n\nvine or bush.  \n\n \n\n  The VERVAIN HUMMING BIRD is a tiny creature, smaller than the\n\nother humming birds.\n It is often called the BEE HUMMING BIRD.\n At times it looks almost like a largish insect as it darts among the\n\nblossoms on a bush. \n\n  Occasionally one sees a pair of these birds circling and rising\n\nhigher and higher in the air, performing a kind of dance.\n They have a surprisingly loud, though squeaky, voice for so tiny a\n\nbird. \n\n  The Vervain Humming bird is only 2 ½ inches ( 5 cm) long.\n The plumage of both sexes is the same: a dull greyish-green above\n\nand greyish-white below.\n The feathers of the tail are tipped with white which shows clearly\n\nwhen the bird is in flight; the tiny bill is sharp and straight. \n\n  These humming birds build a nest of down and plant fibres;\n\nlichen is often used on the outside.\n The sides of these nests sometimes have to be increased in height in\n\norder to prevent the minute nestlings from falling out.  \n\n \n\n  The MOCKING-BIRD which is usually called a NIGHTINGALE, is\n\na very easy bird to recognize.\n It is often seen and heard in gardens, in the town and country.\n Sometimes it will run across a lawn then stop and raise its\n\nwings above its back.\n Its song is very sweet and it can mimic other birds.\n Nightingales are rather quarrelsome and can utter a harsh, scolding,\n\nalarm cry as well. \n\n  These birds are about 10 inches ( 25 cm) long.\n The back is a brownish-grey with a white patch on the wing.\n The underparts are white and they have long tails which are dark\n\nbrown with white edges.\n Mocking-birds nest at least twice a year, building a shallow, untidy\n\nnest.\n illustration\n\n\n\n \n\n  The BANANA QUIT or BEENY BUD is found all over Jamaica, in\n\ntown gardens and in the country, by the sea and in the mountains. \n\n  The bill is black and very curved which assists the bird in its\n\nfeeding.\n It punctures the base of a flower to get at the nectar, and may\n\noften be seen hanging upside down from a twig to do this. \n\n  The Banana Quit is easy to identify.\n It is 5 inches ( 12 cm) long, the back and head are black, the\n\nbreast and underparts yellow; there is a white stripe above the eye and a\n\nwhite spot on the wing.\n The nest is a ball of grass with the entrance at the side.\n illustration\n\n\n\n \n\n  This commonly-seen, bright yellow bird is known locally as\n\nCANARY, but it is neither a canary nor a truly Jamaican bird.\n A few pairs of these finches were brought here from South America in\n\nthe early 1820s and set free in the Black River area.\n They quickly multiplied and are now to be found throughout the\n\nisland.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '62a38c6b-5639-4b5d-b07d-20bb3a55823d', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.403930+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9717570543289185, 'non_english_score': 0.028242945671081543}

within the cranium),\n\nhare-lip and heart and brain defects. \n\n  Anemia is one of the conditions that may result from a deficiency\n\nin folic acid.\n Individuals taking such drugs as aminopterin, streptomycin and the\n\nsulfa drugs must be warned that these drugs destroy folic acid. \n\n  The condition known as spruce, where there is a sore mouth,\n\nindigestion and diarrhoea may also results from the lack of folic acid.\n There may also result a shortage of the large red blood corpuscles,\n\nthe condition known as megaloblastic anemia. \n\n  It is found abundantly in spinach, watercress and the greens of\n\nmustard, beet turnips, parsley, carrots, broccoli and generally in almost all\n\ngreen leaves of vegetables and herbs.\n\n\n \n\n  This vitamin is needed for the proper functioning of the entire\n\ndigestive system, especially by the adrenal gland.\n The number of the B vitamin family is also known as calcium\n\npantothenate and is generally recognized as essential for growth.\n Food processing has often removed this vitamin from the final food\n\nproduct placed on the store shelves. \n\n  When this vitamin is lacking or deficient in the body, there is\n\nreason to believe that this may be a factor in causing rheumatoid arthritis,\n\ngrey hair, skin diseases, constipation, rough skin, granulation of the\n\neye-lids, digestive disorders and damage to the adrenal glands.\n This vitamin has been deemed essential to adequate functioning of the\n\nbrain, and a lack of it may cause profound mental depression.\n Deficiency in this vitamin may prevent conception in the female or\n\nchildren born may be seriously deformed or mentally deficient.\n Muscular tissue requires an abundant supply of this vitamin and it\n\nmust be remembered that the heart is a muscle.\n Other studies indicate an increase in the life-span of 19 percent\n\nwhen there is plentiful pantothenic acid in the diet.\n\n\n  This vitamin is found naturally in royal jelly honey, wheat bran,\n\nbrewer's yeast, broccoli, molasses, peanuts and in nearly all vegetable\n\ntissue.\n One report states that this valuable vitamin has been synthesized and\n\nthat synthetic pantothenic acid obtains effective results. \n\n \n\n  This carbohydrate is deemed to be essential for good nutrition.\n The precise function is uncertain but reports indicate that there are\n\nsome association with the metabolism or transport of fat, it having the\n\ncapacity of preventing the accumulation of fat in the liver.\n When combined with vitamin E, it is said to help in cases of muscular\n\ndystrophy. \n\n  Studies by nutritionists indicate that a deficiency of inositol\n\nmay cause coronary heart attack and accumulations of fat in the liver,\n\ncausing faulty liver functioning.\n A fatty liver is common in diabetes and thus it may be assumed that a\n\ndeficiency of inositol is a contributing factor in connection with that\n\ndisease.\n A shortage of inositol is also reported to interfere with the\n\nadequate production of lecithin, necessary for the control of fat in the\n\nblood.\n In experiments in animals, it has been found that a lack of inositol\n\nwill result in a complete loss of hair.\n Based upon reports of investigators, it would be desirable to include\n\nat least 1000mg of inositol daily to avoid a deficiency of this nutrient.\n\n\n\n  The richest natural sources are yeast, wheat germ and soybean.\n\n\n \n\n  Lecithin is one of the derivatives of glycerin and is of value\n\nfor cases of malnutrition, rickets, anemia, diabetes and tuberculosis.\n It is known as a phospholipid and is formed by the union of one\n\nmolecule of glycerol, two molecules of fatty acid and one molecule each of\n\nphosphoric acid and choline, a nitrogenous base.\n Lecithin helps in the structural support of all cells, especially of\n\nthe brain and nerves.\n It is important in preventing and correcting arterosclerosis, causing\n\ncholesterol and neutral fats to be broken into microscopic particles so they\n\ncan be more easily utilized by the tissues.\n Usually one or two tablespoons daily will keep the fat in the blood\n\nat normal levels.\n It is also of value in relieving the angina pectoris pain in the\n\nregion of the heart to the left shoulder and arm. \n\n  Heart disease resulting from arterosclerosis ( degeneration of\n\nwalls of the arteries) due to lack of sufficient lecithin to cope with a meal\n\nthat is high in fat or excessive in calories, with a condition of\n\narterosclerosis, gradually built up over a period of time, the fat particles\n\nwill often be unable to pass through the arterial walls and consequently\n\nremain in the artries.\n A vicious circle develops and as more fatty deposits form on the\n\narterial walls, the more difficult it is for the fat molecules to pass\n\nthrough the tiny capillaries into the tissue for utilization as energy. \n\n  Lecithin occurs in all unrefined foods containing oil.\n When added to gravies, the fat seems to literally disappear.\n\n\n \n\n  22\n\n O  2  , found in various drying oils such as linseed, poppy\n\nand hemp.\n Individuals with excessively high blood cholesterol may usually\n\nreduce the cholesterol level by ingesting vegetable oils rich in linoleic\n\nacid.\n The more solid fats eaten, the more the need for linoleic acid.\n In addition to linoleic acid, there are two other fatty acids needed\n\nbefore cholesterol and saturated fats can be utilize, namely linoleic acid\n\nand arachic acid, a crystalline fatty compound contained in butter and other\n\nsubstances.\n Linolenic acid is a component of linseed and soybeans oils.\n Linoleic or linolenic acid must be supplied by fats ingested into the\n\nbody to insure a healthy condition of the skin.\n Linoleic linolenic and arachic or arachadonic fatty acids are of the\n\npoly-unsaturated variety. \n\n  Any deficiency results in a tendency toward build-up of crust in\n\narteries, the condition known as arterosilerosis, especially when the intake\n\nof solids fats are high.\n Linoleic acid is a nutrient that utilizes the natural saturated fats\n\nof the body, thus preventing fat build-ups through out the body tissues.\n One indication of a high cholesterol level in the blood is the\n\nappearance of yellow fatty accumulations in the skin around the eyes.\n Sometimes these fat accumulations may appear in other parts of the\n\nbody, such as around the breasts or in the abdominal and pelvic area. \n\n  Many vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid, such as safflower\n\noil, sunflowerseed oil, sesame-seed oil, walnut oil, and soy oil.\n Linoleic acid is also found in corn oil, peanut oil, cotton seed oil,\n\nand a smaller amount of olive oil.\n Human milk and whole grain cereals alos provide sufficient linoleic\n\nacid for infants. \n\n \n\n  This is another B vitamin.\n and it is slightly\n\nsoluble in water, stable in dilute acid and alkali, and easily oxidized.\n It is one of the components of folic acid and helps to maintain the\n\nnatural colour of the hair, as well as helping to maintain the reproductive\n\nglands and organs.\n A number of authorities recommend as much as 200mg of this vitamin\n\ndaily.\n PABA has been recognized as having an inhibitory influence upon the\n\ngrowth of the minute organisms, probably protozoa, fund in typhus fever,\n\nRocky Mountain spotted fever and trench fever, a condition known as\n\nRickeettsia.\n It is also know to inhibit the growth of other bacteria and exerts an\n\ninhibitive influence upon the thyroid hormone synthesis.\n As the thyroid produces only one hormone, thyroxine, which is rich in\n\niodine and which accelerates the metabolism of all cells and tissues it is\n\nimportant for the thyroid to function properly. \n\n  PABA has assisted many cases of arthritis and has also\n\nstrengthened muscles, relieved severe body pains, stopped twitching muscles,\n\nand even improved the memory. \n\n  Another value of PABA is its reported effective use as a sunburn\n\npreventative when applied externally to the skin prior to exposure or\n\ningesting it daily to the extent of 1,000 milligrams.\n It is also valuable in removing the pain of sunburn or other burns to\n\nthe body.\n There are indications that when used as a skin cream it may delay the\n\nskin changes usually accompanying the aging process. \n\n  A deficiency may result in loss of hair or failure of hair to\n\ngrow.\n There may also exist an inability to produce offsprings.\n The lack of or insufficient PABA may prevent normal functioning of\n\nthe various glands and organs of the body, and the presence of this vitamin\n\ncontrols the growth of undesirable bacteria or protozoa found in typhus\n\nfever.\n A lack of PABA may also be a contributory factor in producing\n\nhyperthyroidism, as its presence controls the action of the thyroid gland.\n\n\n\n  It is readily available from the foods that ordinarily have the B\n\ncomplex vitamins, and such foods as rice polish, rice bran and wheat germ are\n\nespecially valuable for this vitamin and also yeast. \n\n \n\n  Recent research indicates that oxalic acid markedly reduces the\n\nblood coagulation time, making it valuable in treating conditions where there\n\nis uncontrolled bleeding or hemorrhages.\n Often individuals will avoid many fine fruits and vegetables because\n\nthere are some oxalic acid in them and they may have passed some\n\ncalcium-oxalate stones.\n However, it has been found that oxalate stones are formed even when\n\nno oxalic acid whatsoever is found in the diet.\n Apparently stones will form from a deficiency in vitamin A, and\n\nthere are undoubtedly other factors about body chemistry in regard to stone\n\nformation that are still unknown.\n A shortage of vitamin B6 has also been associated with calcium-\n\noxalate stone formation.\n It has been suggested that no healthful food should be avoided but\n\nemphasis placed on complete protein and mineral balances, and to avoid\n\ndeficiencies of any of the important nutrients.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': "harles Bernard Lewis, Jr was born in Worcester,\n\n   Massachusetts   in April of 1913.\n Bernard, as he was generally known, attended public schools in\n\nWestchester, Pennsylvania and Providence, Rhode Island.\n In 1931, he entered Brown University, also in Providence, and\n\ngraduated in 1935 with a BA degree in Biology.\n During these years he also seems to have acquired a considerable\n\nknowledge of geology.\n In addition, he was something of an athlete and took part in track\n\nmeets, his best event being the broad jump.\n He was considered to be of Olympic calibre but was unable to take part\n\nin the trials for the United States Olympic team that went to Berlin in 1936.\n It was during his university years that Bernard met and became a\n\nlifelong friend of Jesse Owens, the American sensation of those memorable\n\ngames.\n After Brown University, Bernard went on to become a graduate student\n\nand instructor at John Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n There he was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford where he studied\n\nfrom 1936 to 1939. \n\n  In 1938, he was a member of an Oxford University Biological\n\nExpedition to the Cayman Islands.\n The team did much collecting and several publications were\n\nproduced as the result of their work.\n The Herpetology\n\nof the Cayman Islands  , published in 1940 by the Institute of Jamaica.\n An even more important event for him that year was his marriage in\n\nOctober to Lucille Bodden whom he had met in Grand Cayman. \n\n  While visiting Jamaica in 1938, Bernard contacted the Board of\n\nGovernors of the Institute of Jamaica and presented proposals for the\n\nsetting up of a Natural History Museum.\n He must have been delighted when the Board not only accepted his\n\nproposals but also invited him to accept the post of Curator of the Museum.\n His salary was to be &pound; 500 per annum, supplemented by some\n\nperquisites. \n\n  September 1, 1939, the day Adolph Hitler sent his troops into\n\nPoland, was the day Bernard took up his new post.\n Two days later, England and France declared war on Germany; the\n\nSecond World War had officially begun. \n\n  The Institute of Jamaica already had the nucleus of a collection\n\nof animals and plants.\n Bernard immediately set to work to improve it, a task in which he was\n\ngreatly aided by local schoolteachers.\n However, as the war continued, collecting equipment, petrol,\n\ntyres and automobile parts became scarce or entirely lacking so that field\n\ntrips had to be curtailed.\n In the meantime, in spite of material and manpower shortages,\n\nwork on the construction of the Natural History Building had begun.\n It was actually completed in 1945, before the war ended in August.\n\n\n\n  With the coming of peace, filed trips were again possible.\n Bernard spent many hours in the field but his administrative duties\n\nincreased, especially after he was appointed Director of the Institute in\n\n1950.\n 'tied to his desk'\n\n or in committee meetings. \n\n  Bernard Lewis had a wide interest in zoology and he was also very\n\nknowledgeable about botany and geology.\n He had been a good choice to revive the natural history work of the\n\nInstitute and his wider interests also made him a good choice for his new\n\npost as Director.\n He entered with enthusiasm into historical and archeological\n\nprojects.\n He had a natural interest in painting and he put a great deal of\n\neffort into preparing the building on North Street which was to house the\n\nJamaica School of Art.\n\n\n \n\nexpanded considerably during Bernard Lewis's years as Director.\n The Arawak Museum at White Marl, the Military Museum at Up Park Camp,\n\nthe Folk Museum in Spanish Town, the former African Museum at Devon House,\n\nand the National Library on East Street, successor to the West India\n\nReference Library, were all developed as new Divisions of the Institute.\n Nor did he neglect the Institute's Junior Centres on East Street and\n\nat Half-Way-Tree.\n He was very much involved in the original planning for the\n\ndevelopment of a museum at Port Royal and was one of the key members of the\n\ncommittee that planned the Zoo at Hope.\n In connection with the Zoo, he made a trip to Belize and Costa Rica\n\nto obtain Central American animals which would add interest to the Zoo's\n\ncollection. \n\n  Bernard Lewis was a prolific writer.\n Jamaica\n\nJournal  and local Science and Historical Society publications.\n of\n\nthe Jamaican Natural History Society of which he was a member.\n He was also a member of the Geological Society, the Historical\n\nSociety, the Gosse Bird Club and the Library Association.\n He served on the government Historical Monuments Committee,\n\nWildlife Protection Committee, Scientific Research Council, Jamaica\n\nNational Trust and the Jamaica National Commission for UNESCO. \n\n  Even when he was Director of the Institute, Bernard never\n\nhesitated when heavy furniture, boxes and books needed to be moved.\n His strength and energy aroused comment, even when he was\n\nmiddle-aged.\n In fact, his energy and keenness could be disconcerting to some of\n\nhis companions when after a full day of collecting natural history specimens\n\nthey found themselves still collecting at a light trap at one o'clock in the\n\nmorning in an area such as Portland Ridge. \n\n  It came as a great surprise to Bernard to receive an OBE in 1957,\n\nan honour of which he was justifiably proud and for which he received many\n\ncongratulations.\n Another well-deserved honour came in 1959 when the Institute of\n\nJamaica awarded him a Silver Musgrave Medal in recognition of his\n\nencouragement of Arts and Science in Jamaica. \n\n  He went on retirement leave on August 1, 1973 after thirty-four\n\nyears of service to the Institute.\n In October, 1976, he suffered a severe stroke from which he never\n\nfully recovered.\n He and his wife Lucille moved to Tampa, Florida, where he died as a\n\nresult of a fall in September 1992. \n\n  Throughout his life, Bernard Lewis set an outstanding example of\n\na man totally dedicated to his work and to the mandate of the Institute of\n\nJamaica:  For the encouragement of Art, Science and Literature. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  oral reefs are tropical, shallow water,\n\nlimestone structures that support a wide variety of marine plants and\n\nanimals.\n Reefs are unique in that they are formed by some of the animals and\n\nplants that inhabit them.\n The group that contributes the most to reef formation is the stony\n\ncorals. \n\n \n\n  Corals are sessile ( not mobile) and because of this they were\n\nfor a long time assumed to be plants.\n The first person to propose that they were not plants was the French\n\nnaturalist Jean Andre Peyssonel in 1723.\n His ideas were ridiculed and then rejected by the French Academy of\n\nSciences.\n Peyssonel was so discouraged by this that he gave up all\n\nscientific work.\n\n\n  Corals are invertebrates that belong to the phylum Cnidaria, as\n\ndo the jellyfish and the closest living relatives of corals, the sea\n\nanemones.\n They live in colonies made up of a collection of independent but\n\nconnected coral polyps which form a thin living skin over the limestone\n\nskeleton.\n A coral polyp is basically a simple tube topped with a mouth\n\nsurrounded by a ring of tentacles [ see 4].\n Each polyp sits in the coral skeleton in a small cup into which it\n\ncan contract in order to protect itself.\n Polyps are small but they do vary in size with species from a\n\nmillimeter to a few centimetres in diameter. \n\n  A remarkable feature of corals, considering the small size of\n\nindividual coral polyps, is their ability to form massive limestone\n\nstructures.\n The most famous of these is the Great Barrier Reef which stretches\n\nover two thousand kilometres parallel to the northeast coast of Australia.\n This ability to form permanent structures is made possible by the\n\nsymbiotic association of coral   and algae.\n The algae, known as zooxanthellae, live and photosynthesize\n\nwithin the lining of the coral polyps.\n The process of photosynthesis enhances the rate at which corals can\n\nprecipitate calcium from the water around them for skeleton formation and\n\nalso provides carbon products for use by the coral as food.\n In return, the coral provides the algae with a safe environment in\n\nwhich to live.\n So although it appears at first to be a simple immobile organism, the\n\ncoral is, in fact, a complex association of an animal and a plant that\n\ntogether form a rock. \n\n  In Jamaica there are forty-three species of reef-building coral.\n These vary greatly in size and shape from the massive Boulder Coral,\n\n Montastrea annulayis,  which commonly forms heads two metres in\n\ndiameter, to the tiny Golfball Coral,  Favia fragum,  with an\n\naverage size of 2.5 centimetres.\n\n\nDiplotia,  and dense thickets of branching Elkhorn and Staghorn Coral,\n\n Acropora. \n Deeper on the reef there are the delicate flat plates of the Lettuce\n\nCoral,  Agaricia.  \n\n \n\n  In addition to their great beauty, which is enjoyed by scuba\n\ndivers and snorkellers, reefs have several important ecological\n\nfunctions.\n They provide a home for a vast array of other plants and animals,\n\nincluding economically important fish and shellfish, the primary\n\nresources of Jamaica's fishing industry.\n They are the source of sand for our beaches and also serve to protect\n\nthose beaches from wave action, and subsequent erosion, by breaking the force\n\nof the waves before they reach the shore.\n Damage to a reef affects the reef itself, the fishing and\n\nrecreational activities that rely on the reef, as well as the beaches it\n\nprotects. \n\n \n\n  Corals have a low tolerance for changes in environmental\n\nconditions and, as a result, coral reef communities are extremely susceptible\n\nto pollution.\n The most serious threats are deposits of sediment and excess\n\nnutrients. \n\n  Sediment in the water comes primarily from hillsides that have\n\nbeen eroded as a result of poor farming practices and deforestation.\n The eroded soil is washed down by rivers to the sea.\n Sediment has two effects on coral.\n First, when suspended in the water, it blocks sunlight from the\n\ncorals, preventing the symbiotic algae from functioning.\n The second effect occurs when sediment settles on the coral itself,\n\nsmothering and killing the delicate polyps. \n\n  Excess nutrients in the water, primarily nitrates and phosphates\n\nfrom domestic sewage effluent, enhance the growth of plant life.\n This process is known as eutrophication.\n Large blooms in the water, of microscopic plants known as\n\nphytoplankton have the same effect on coral as sediment suspended in the\n\nwater: they block out light.\n At the same time the rapid growth of thick mats of seaweed on the\n\nreef has the same effect as sediment settling onto the coral: it smothers it.\n\n\n\n \n\n  The damaging effects of eutrophication and increased\n\nsediment load in the water can be seen just south of Kingston, where there is\n\na prevailing westerly surface current [ see 5].\n The reefs off Half Moon Bay in Hellshire, down current from the mouth\n\nof Kingston Harbour are shown in plate 6.\n The water is murky, the coral is dead and overgrown by the green\n\nfilamentous algae,  Bryopsis  .\n Plate 7 shows the contrasting reef at Windward Edge, just south of\n\nthe Palisadoes and to the east, up-current of the mouth of Kingston Harbour.\n The water is clear and there is an abundance of live coral and\n\nlittle growth of algae.\n With the reefs that protect them damaged, the beaches of Hellshire\n\nhave also suffered.\n For example, between 1984 and 1988, Half Moon Bay lost between\n\nfifteen and twenty metres of beach [ Hendry 1989]. \n\n  The damaging effect of pollution on the environment in this part\n\nof Jamaica is not a new phenomenon. In a 1972 article in  Jamaica\n\nJournal  on coastal water pollution, Barry Wade described in\n\ndetail the deteriorating state of Kingston Harbour.\n 'It is of great concern that Jamaica's coral reefs\n\n& should not be subjected to such pollution.' \n Twenty-one years later, sewage effluent and industrial waste\n\ncontinue to pour into, and out of, Kingston Harbour and Dr Wade's concern has\n\nbecome a reality.\n The problem of pollution is not confined to Kingston Harbour.\n It has spread to the reefs of Hellshire and the south coast.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '2640ff68-df0f-4acd-8719-d1b6bb4f5f2b', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.406330+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9762488603591919, 'non_english_score': 0.023751139640808105}
{'text': 'Sustainable development is the buzzword of the environmentally\n\nconscious nineties.\n The Jamaica Conservation and Development Trust, a not-for-profit,\n\nnon-government organisation has  " working for sustainable\n\ndevelopment"  as its motto.\n " development\n\nthat meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of\n\nfuture generations to meet their own needs."  \n\n  We will all agree that economic development is essential both for\n\na country and for individuals.\n Simply put development is an improvement in standards of living,\n\nusually achieved by the production of goods and services for sale.\n The fact is, that all development is in some way based on the use of\n\nnatural resources \x13 tourism is dependent on beautiful beaches, waterfalls and\n\nattractive natural sites; agriculture is dependent on fertile soil and\n\ndependable sources of water and every industry requires water. \n\n  In light of this, conservation or wise use of our resources is\n\nsimply good sense.\n " For if the\n\nobject of development is to provide for social and economic welfare, the\n\nobject of conservation is to ensure Earth\'s capacity to sustain development\n\nand support life".  \n\n  The establishment and management of National and Marine Parks is\n\none of the major projects of the Jamaica Conservation and Development Trust (\n\nJCDT).\n These Parks are large areas of land or sea, in as pristine a state as\n\npossible, protected by law from destructive use for the enjoyment and benefit\n\nof Jamaicans.\n National Parks have been viewed as a tool or vehicle for sustainable\n\ndevelopment as they encourage development that is compatible with the\n\nnatural environment and seek to ensure that benefits accrue to local\n\ncommunities. \n\n  The first two Parks are the Blue and John Crow Mountains National\n\nPark and the Montego Bay Marine Park.\n They were established through the Protected Areas Resource\n\nConservation ( PARC) Project, funded by USAID and the Government of Jamaica.\n The JCDT played a major role in the planning and implementation of\n\nthis successful project - the first time a private sector organisation has\n\nhad such an important role in a government project.\n Two other Parks will be established under phase two of this\n\nproject \x13 the Black River National Park and the Cockpit Country National\n\nPark. \n\n  Although the primary reason for selection of these sites for\n\nprotection of their natural resources, many of which are unique to\n\nJamaica, the importance of these areas for socio-economic benefits to local\n\ncommunities and Jamaica on a whole was paramount.\n The Blue and John Crow Mountains are the watershed for close to half\n\nof Jamaica\'s population.\n The Montego Bay Marine Park protects the coral reefs and other marine\n\nand coastal systems critical to that city\'s continued success as the islands\n\nforemost tourism dollar earner.\n The Black River National Park focuses on an area of great cultural\n\nheritage and importance for the fishing industry, particularly for\n\nshrimp.\n The rugged terrain of the Cockpit Country is the source of the major\n\nrivers in the West and South-west of the island in addition to providing\n\nhabitat for hundreds of unique plant species. \n\n  Public participation in the planning and management of the\n\nisland\'s first two National Parks has been the key to their success.\n Local advisory committees meet regularly with Park management to\n\ndiscuss relevant issues and evolve solutions that meet the goals of the\n\nvarious interest groups.\n One such success story is the building of the fording over the\n\nYallahs River between Mavis Bank and Hagley Gap in 1992.\n The fording was destroyed during Hurricane Gilbert and had never been\n\nrepaired leading to great difficulties in transportation as the road was the\n\nonly one into and out of those rural villages.\n It was through the encouragement and support of the Blue and John\n\nCrow Mountain National Park staff and the Jamaica Conservation and\n\nDevelopment Trust that the community was able to rebuild the fording.\n Thus, the projects of the JCDT not only seek to protect plants and\n\nanimals and the places they live but also to protect the livelihood of\n\ncommunities.\n Another project of the JCDT and the Park is the facilitation of\n\ncommunity members in the Hagley Gap and Minto areas in the establishment of a\n\nTour Guide Company.\n Financial and technical assistance including training is being\n\nprovided over the long term to the Top of Jamaica, Blue Mountain Company.\n This is a great example of sustainable development, the long-term\n\nsuccess of this tour company is dependent on their wise use of the natu <l>\n\nral resources in the area. \n\n  Conservation and Development therefore are not incompatible.\n With careful planning and consideration of our environment \x13\n\nboth natural and social, the path to sustainable development can be taken and\n\nall the benefits derived.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Humans generate more energy by burning wood for cooking and heat\n\n<l> ing than they generate from hydro-electric dams and nuclear fuel plants.\n But, according to UNEP estimates, the current rate of deforestation\n\nmeans that, by the year 2000, about 2.7 billion people will be short of the\n\nfuel they need to cook their daily meal. \n\n  Every year, people clear and burn the trees of an area half the\n\nsize of The Netherlands \x13 22,000 km squared \x13 so they can cook their food and\n\nheat their homes.\n Much of the wood is made into charcoal, because charcoal is light,\n\nburns hot but slowly and is easily broken up into manageable, burnable\n\nlumps.\n But making charcoal wastes 70 percent of the energy of the wood, even\n\nbefore it has been dug out from the ovens in which it is made.\n Even when the wood is burnt directly because the wood is in big\n\nlumps, is wet or is burnt inefficiently on an open fire or in an old stove.\n\n\n\n  Trees are actually a renewable energy source; they are simply\n\nstores of solar energy, because it is sunlight that allows them to\n\nphotosynthesize and grow.\n But the people who depend on trees for their daily needs are burning\n\nwood faster than it can grow.\n Between 30 and 40 percent of the world\'s 5 billion people are depen\n\n<l> dent on wood for cooking and heating.\n In 1980 1.3 billion people were already short of fuel-wood; by the\n\nend of the century, 2.7 billion people will be short of firewood. \n\n  This rate of fuel consumption might, at one time, have been\n\nsustainable for fewer people.\n Now, the land on which the wood once grew is not left for regrowth,\n\nbut is used for building and farming, or is simply too fragile to recover,\n\nfor example, in places such as Somalia and Amazonia.\n But the people who use this wood do not mean to destroy their\n\nhomelands; they are simply trying to survive.\n\n\n  Some of these people, those who are on the edge of poverty, can\n\nuse wood more efficiently, by using better designed stoves, letting their\n\nwood dry and cutting it into smaller pieces.\n It is the fact that these people can reduce the wood they use, and so\n\nreduce their impact on their environment, that illustrates the cost of\n\npoverty.\n Many more people either do not have access to or cannot afford an\n\nefficient stove and, especially in Africa, the women spend so long walking to\n\nfind wood that they do not have the slightest chance of building up a reserve\n\nof wood to dry.\n wood\n\nat best, and certainly have no time to collect extra wood.\n So they use what they can, as they find it.\n They very rarely have the necessary tools to cut the wood up\n\ninto small pieces so that it dries out more quickly and burns more\n\nefficiently. \n\n \n\n  Steven Karekezi, Executive Secretary of the Foundation for Wood\n\nStove Dissemination, points out that the efficient wood stoves now being used\n\nincreasingly throughout Asia and Africa can reduce charcoal use by up to 50\n\npercent.\n The improvements in efficiency result from: controlling the air flow\n\nto the fuel; insulating the side of the stove to minimize waste heat; and\n\nusing small pieces of dry wood or charcoal.\n Karekezi emphasizes that these are not laboratory figures,\n\nbut that they are the gains that can be made in everyday use.\n The stoves use simple designs, and are easily manufactured by trained\n\nlocal craftsmen throughout Africa and Asia; however, the necessary materi <l>\n\nals are required, and enough people with money to buy them.\n The basic materials are thin sheet metal and a clay suitable for\n\nfiring. \n\n  The idea to develop and use more efficient woodstoves was initiat\n\n<l> ed by Mahatma Gandhi in the 1950s.\n Gandhi wanted to remove wood smoke from Indian household kitchens,\n\nand so improve the health of women and children.\n Wood smoke that is trapped in the cooking places of the poor causes\n\nconsiderable lung damage.\n Gandhi\'s improved wood stove movement was reinvigorated and given\n\nglobal significance with the energy crises of the 1970s, when the\n\ncontribution of biomass ( mostly wood, but including dried animal dung) to\n\nnational energy consumption began to be quantified.\n Biomass combustion in Asia and Africa is currently estimated to\n\ncontribute, on average, 35 percent of the energy used annually, but in some\n\ncountries it makes up much more than that. \n\n  With the importance of biomass in these development countries,\n\nthe expense of fossil fuels drove people to further.\n The global significance of deforestation was also recognized; wood\n\nburning contributed to the greenhouse effect, and tree felling reduced the\n\nplanet\'s capacity to reabsorb the carbon dioxide given off by combustion\n\nand also exposed the top solid to greater erosion. \n\n  Furthermore, there has been a growing awareness of the sheer\n\nscale of the health risk posed by wood smoke inhalation.\n In 1987, the World Health Organization declared that respiratory\n\ndiseases were the principle cause of death among children younger than five,\n\nwith kitchen wood smoke being one of the major causes of respiratory disease.\n\n\n\n  Improving the access of the poor in Africa and Asia to these\n\nsimple, but effective, stoves will be a crucial factor in the fight to\n\nimprove the quality of their lives and their environments. \n\n  The table on the left shows estimated rural and urban use of\n\nimproved wood stoves.\n These are indicative figures only; because these stoves are\n\nmanufactured in the informal sectors of most economies, their use is\n\nmuch more widespread than these figures indicate within these the\n\nneighbouring countries. \n\n  The Foundation for Wood Stove Dissemination is based in Nairobi,\n\nKenya, and has focal points in China, Guatemala, the Indian sub-continent,\n\nIndonesia, Kenya, Senegal and Zimbabwe.   \n\n \n\n \n\n  The UNEP Collaborating Centre on Energy and Environment at the\n\nRiso National Laboratory, P.O. Box 49, DK 4000, Roskilde, Denmark, in\n\nconjunction with The Foundation for Woodstove Dissemination and the African\n\nEnergy Policy Research Network, has just published Energy options for Africa:\n\nenvironmentally sustainable alternatives, ( Zed Books), Edited by Stephen\n\nKarekezi and Gordon Mackenzie, this book addresses a wide range of the energy\n\nissues faced by African countries. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  ONE of the many challenges facing every developing nation\n\nis the inevitable trade-off between economic development and concerns for the\n\nnatural environment.\n Policymakers in these countries have the unenviable task of\n\nformulating and ensuring implementation of development policies which must\n\ntake several factors into consideration.\n It is well recognised that the process of industrialisation is one\n\nroute to overcome or reduce poverty.\n In the past, much emphasis has been placed on the economic aspects,\n\nsuch as Gross Domestic Product as it was felt these were important indicators\n\nof the level of development and that they would provide the means whereby\n\nsocial issues such as poverty could be addressed.  \n\n  It has become more and more evident, however, that issues such as\n\nenvironmental protection, future viability of species, ( including human\n\nbeings) and poverty cannot be divorced from the economic development\n\npursuits. \n\n  Poverty may be defined as lack of resources both material and\n\nspiritual.\n One of the consequences of poverty is ignorance and this can have\n\ndevastating effects on the environment.\n Many people who are poor are nor aware of the effects of their\n\nactions on the environment and consequently have not made the connection\n\nbetween degradation of the environment and future problems to be experienced\n\nby them.\n Indeed, many who are rich are also unaware.\n This is amply illustrated by the wanton cutting of trees by some\n\npersons, which they burn for charcoal, or as clearance of plots to provide\n\nfarm land.\n These activities are conducted to generate income and to provide a\n\nlivelihood for the individual and his family in the short term.\n The soil erosion which results from the removal of the trees and the\n\nfuture effect on rainfall are not considered in the immediacy of providing\n\nfor short term needs.\n This then points out the need for increasing public\n\nawareness/education of the majority of the people so that the consequences of\n\ntheir action today can be fully understood.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'e1bb0b48-2bb4-44d9-9a0e-cdec77af07c7', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.407836+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9665605425834656, 'non_english_score': 0.033439457416534424}
{'text': 'view of the January 13, 1993 Earthquake at the Petroleum Corporation of\n\nJamaica Auditorium. \n\n  The most significant information to emerge was that the\n\nWagwater Fault Zone is capable of generating a large earthquake.\n Data collected up to the 1970s led to the belief that major\n\nsource zones for earthquake affecting Jamaica are off-shore.\n Monitoring of activity over the past ten years shows that the Wagwater\n\nFault is active and is capable of generating damaging earthquakes.\n In light of this present knowledge, the seismologists and\n\ngeologists will have to re-think the epicentre locations for the 1907 and the\n\n1692 earthquakes.\n The implications for a repeat of the 1692 earthquake with the\n\nepicentre on land, are stunning. \n\n  " six\n\nseismograph stations were functioning at the time of the earthquake, allowing\n\naccurate location of the epicentre, despite an initial loss of data due\n\nto the power outage.\n Some thirty-odd after shocks were also located in a zone between\n\nfour and twenty kilometres deep trending NW-SW.\n It said that further resolution of data will permit definition of the\n\nfault plane on which movement occurred. \n\n \n\n  " The importance of having a functioning seismograph net\n\n<l> work for the collection of earthquake information cannot be\n\noverstressed.\n The monitoring of active faults will eventually allow us to calculate\n\nthe probability of those faults generating earthquakes of a certain\n\nmagnitude \x13 calculations such as these are critical to planning for earthqua\n\n<l> ke,"  it added. \n\n  " The presentation of damage resulting from the tremor re\n\n<l> inforced what was already known.\n\n\nfer more severe damage.\n Unreinforced structures such as those made of timber and nog,\n\nand structures which are not braced will also suffer severe damage." \n\n\n\n  " Based on the papers presented, several\n\nrecommendations were made.\n\n\n \n\nca; \n\n  b) Installing solar batteries as back-up power supplier for seis\n\n<l> mograph stations; \n\n  c) The Ministry of Education should carry out a thorough\n\ninspection of school buildings using the current building code as a guide\n\nwith a view to retrofitting or modifying any buildings which do not meet\n\nspecifications; \n\n  d) The Ministry of Education should, in conjunction with the ODP\n\nand the various PTAs, run earthquake drills in schools and have after event\n\naction plans for getting children home safely. \n\n  e) All utility companies and critical facilities should\n\nimplement earthquake preparedness and mitigation programmes; \n\n  f) The Z factor should be recalculated during the present re\n\n<l> view of the Building Code so as to reflect the probability of a large\n\nearthquake generated on the island.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  PRESERVATION OF the marine environment is essential for\n\ncountries whose economies revolve around the marketing of their immediate\n\ncoastal resources.  \n\n  Almost all Caribbean territories sell packages of sun, sand and\n\nsea to tourists from the temperate climes, offering them a chance to \n\n" get away from it all"  , and sit down and relax.\n Those countries with fine white sand beaches and healthy, accessible\n\ncoral reefs generally have more marketable products than those who\n\ndo not. \n\n  More and more, these countries are beginning to realise that the\n\nproducts they are marketing are very fragile and are susceptible to damage.\n Several of these territories have, as a result, set up marine parks\n\nto protect these valuable natural resources. \n\n \n\n  Two such parks are the St. John National Park, located in the\n\nU.S. Virgin Islands, and the Montego Bay Marine Park, found on the north-west\n\ncoast of Jamaica. \n\n  The U.S. Virgin Islands consists of three main islands; St.\n\nThomas, St. Croix and St. John.\n\n\n than   St. John. \n\n  St. John has a population of approximately 4,500 persons, and\n\nabout 80 per cent of the entire island falls under the St. John National\n\nPark.\n The St. John National Park is part of the United States National\n\nParks Service, which in turn runs over a hundred protected areas around the\n\nUnited States and its territories.\n As a result, the St. John National Park is a well developed\n\ninstitution with a number of responsibilities. \n\n \n\nfering functions.\n One set concentrates on patrolling and the enforcement of\n\nenvironmental laws, while the other set consists of  " Interpretive\n\nRangers"  , or tour guides. \n\n  There are departments within the park structures to deal with\n\nscientific monitoring, maintenance of buildings, lawns and sewage\n\nplants, concessions, environment education, administration and accounts.\n In all, about 150 persons are employed to the St. John National Park.\n\n\n\n  In contrast, the Montego Bay Marine Park is much younger and much\n\nsmaller.\n Work on the marine park started in 1989, and it was officially opened\n\non July 23, 1992.\n The park has a manager, a scientific officer, a public relations\n\nofficer, four rangers, and two administrative staff. \n\n  The Montego Bay Marine Park was started as a project funded by\n\nUSAID, and now features inputs from the Natural Resources Conservation\n\nAuthority, the Jamaica Conservation Department Trust, and the Planning\n\nInstitute of Jamaica.\n\n\nmental in nature. \n\n  In terms of physical size, the marine park is quite large.\n\n\nInternational Airport, to the Great River, a distance of about nine\n\nkilometres.\n It stretches out to a depth of 100-200 metres.\n\n\n  Though these two marine parks are very different, they have to\n\ncope with similar problems.\n Two problems which are high on their priority list are overfishing\n\nand cruise ships visits. \n\n \n\n  In Montego Bay, the marine park recently imposed a ban on spear\n\nfishing in the entire park.\n The rangers of the marine park are also enforcing a 1979 fisheries\n\nregulation prohibiting all types of fishing in the Bogue Lagoon section\n\nof the marine park.\n\n\n  St. John\'s biggest problem seems to be the cruise shipping\n\nindustry. \n\n  The small island is forced to absorb just over a million cruise\n\nship visitors within a calendar year and this saturation is having a marked\n\neffect on the destruction of coral reefs within areas popularly visited by\n\ncruise ship passengers.  \n\n\n\n  From the Minister of the Public Service and the Environment\n\n \n\n  AS we observe World Environment Day and the start of\n\nEnvironmental Awareness Week for 1993, all Jamaicans should be deeply\n\nconcerned at the signs of environmental stress, and the serious deterioration\n\nof local and international environmental Awareness Week,  " Poverty\n\nand the Environment"  . \n\n  Unless we address and solve problems related to sound physical\n\nplanning and appropriate environmental management measures, and attain\n\nconsensus on sustainable development, the well-being of both present and\n\nfuture generations cannot be assured.\n Any delay in taking action to stop the continuous environmental\n\ndeterioration, may result in permanent and irreversible damage to the fragile\n\necological integrity of this  " land of wood and water."  \n\n  The current threat to the environment, which is becoming a\n\nconcern of all citizens, sectors, and indeed all mankind, stems essentially\n\nfrom lack of understanding, and past neglect, in the management of our\n\nnatural resources.\n The Jamaican environment has been degraded by decades of poor\n\nagricultural practices, industrial pollution, inadequate and unsafe disposal\n\nof sewage, inappropriate use of hillside lands , and non-sustainable\n\npractices in agriculture, fishery and forestry. \n\n  Developing countries such as the island of Jamaica also face\n\ndistinct environmental problems arising from size, scale, poverty and\n\npopulation pressure. \n\n  To achieve sustainable development, economic growth is a\n\ncompelling necessity.\n However, sustainable development implies the incorporation of\n\nenvironmental concerns into economic planning and policies at personal,\n\ncommunity, and national levels, as well as within firms and commercial\n\nentities. \n\n  The designation of June 5 as World Environment Day followed the\n\n1972 Environmental Conference in Stockholm.\n " Earth\n\nSummit"  , at which over one hundred Heads of State made important\n\ncommitments related to the protection of the Climate, the Earth\'s\n\nBiodiversity and, indeed, led to the acceptance and endorsement of a global\n\nplan of environmental action, known as  " AGENDA 21"  to take\n\nus into the 21st Century without continuing the environmentally inappropriate\n\nactions of the past and present. \n\n<P>  We in Jamaica marked on June 5, the second anniversary of the\n\npassing of the Natural Resources Conservation Authority ( NRCA) Act of 1991,\n\nand the establishment of the NRCA on June 5, 1991. \n\n  The Natural Resources Conservation Authority has a very wide\n\nmandate, covering environmental education, coastal zone management, watershed\n\nmanagement, pollution control, conservation of protected areas and species,\n\nwaste management and national parks policy.\n It is still in the process of establishing regulations,\n\norganisational arrangements, enforcements for appropriate liaison with\n\ngovernment and with the private sector, community groups and non-governmental\n\norganisations are being given particular attention. \n\n  Already, the Natural Resources Conservation Authority has\n\nimplemented new arrangements for monitoring environmental impacts, and\n\nensuring community participation in the review of Environmental Assessments\n\nand Audits.\n It is in the process of implementing Pollution Reduction measures\n\ninvolving both governmental and private sector polluters.\n It intends to move beyond the present regime of voluntary compliance\n\nwith environmental standards, to a regime of mandatory compliance by early\n\n1994.\n The necessary studies required to form the basis of clean-up of\n\nspecific damaged ecosystems such as the Kingston Harbour, are well underway,\n\nand the public will see the long-term measures to reverse the damage done\n\nover the several decades of neglect being put in place in a very systematic\n\nand methodical manner.\n The measures for improvement in environmental management capacity\n\nwill not only involve the NRCA but, of necessity, must also involve\n\nimprovements in the capacity of related agencies in the public service, such\n\nas the Town Planning Department, the Environmental Control Division, and key\n\nresource management agencies, such as those responsible for Fisheries,\n\nForestry and Water Resource Management. \n\n  Finally, the government is committed to the participation and\n\ninvolvement of individuals and Community-Based Organisations ( CBO\'s) in the\n\nenvironmental thrust, since it is the individual whose environmental ethics,\n\nand attitudes, who will ultimately secure the  " sustainable\n\ndevelopment"  culture and future toward which we aspire.\n The recently established Environmental Foundation of Jamaica, based\n\non an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and Jamaican\n\nGovernments, and the Canadian-sponsored Green Fund, now in the final stages\n\nof being established, will provide resources in the form of grants and\n\ntechnical support, to allow community-based and non-governmental\n\norganisations to execute meaningful environmental projects. \n\n  Our Prime Minister, in his speech at Rio last June pointed out\n\nthat  " it is in our hands that the solutions to environmental\n\nproblems rest&" \n Let us continue to work together on finding solutions to these\n\nproblems, in our communities, at work, and in all aspects of our national\n\nlife, to ensure that we preserve our environment for future generations to\n\nenjoy. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  THE potato is best propagated by whole tubers ( seeds).\n When tubers are too large they can be cut into 57 gms ( 2 oz)\n\nsprouted ( eye-carrying) slices of the tubers.\n These tubers should be treated with a copper-based fungicide (\n\npre-treated tubers). \n\n  Planting is accomplished by placing seeds in furrows with\n\nsprouting nodes down and coverring to a depth of 5-7.5 cm ( 2-3 inches).\n\n\n\n \n\n  Rows should be 81-91 cms ( 32-36 inches) apart and plants should\n\n30-38 cms ( 12-15 inches) apart in the rows. \n\n \n\n  The Irish Potato needs lots of nitrogen and potash.\n At planting apply 168 kilogrammes ( kg/ha), a hectare ( 150 lbs an\n\nacre) N, 280 kg/ha ( 250 lbs/ac) Phosphate ( P205)Potash ( K20); or in\n\nsplit application at planting and at first earthing up, moulding or ridging.\n The fertiliser should be placed in the bottom of furrows and covered\n\nwith a thin layer of soil immediately before planting the seeds ( sprouts\n\ndown) in the furrows. \n\n  At high rates of Potash ( K20) application i.e. above 168 kg/ha (\n\n150 lbs/ac) Potash should be applied preferably in the form of Potassium\n\nSulphate ( K2S04) as potatoes tend to be sensitive to excess chloride.\n This depresses the specific gravity, dry matter content, and starch\n\ncontent of the tubers.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'c62e7194-e66d-413b-b039-0cbb53937053', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.409369+00:00',

{'text': 'The Orchidaceae are one of the largest and most diverse\n\nfamilies of flowering plants, accounting for about 8% of all the\n\nflowering plant species.\n Estimates of the size of the orchid family vary from 12,000 to\n\n35,000.\n Orchids just have not been studied well enough to be sure.\n A figure of about 20,000 species is given as reasonable by Dressler (\n\n1981).\n It is more difficult to guess what proportion live on the ground (\n\nterrestrial) and what proportion grow on top of other plants ( epi <l>\n\nphytic), but perhaps one quarter are obligately terrestrial.\n A few orchids are unable to produce their own organic material (\n\nsaprophytes); they obtain nourishment from decaying plants. \n\n  In Jamaica there are approximately 237 species of orchids.\n This compares with 280 in Cuba and 250 in the Dominican Republic.\n\n\nendmic   endemic   to the island.\n Approximately 60 species are endemic.\n They represent about 25% of the Jamaican orchids, which is\n\nsimilar to the endemism rate for the island\'s flowering plants in total (\n\n27%). \n\n \n\n  Some orchids have only been collected once.\n are\n\nalmost certainly extinct in Jamaica.\n In other species, it is just not known for certain.\n There are other species that were not described by Adams in his book,\n\nTHE FLOWERING PLANTS OF JAMAICA ( 1972) since they either were not dis <l>\n\ncovered by earlier botanists or have arrived after 1970.\n Species and hybrids missing in the two main reference works\n\non Jamaican orchids ( Fawcett and Rendle 1910; Adams 1972) are listed in\n\nTable 1.\n At least one endemic orchid has not yet been described and may not\n\nlast much longer.\n But the problems that orchids in Jamaica face will be covered in a\n\nseparate section. \n\n \n\n  There are about two dozen orchids that grow in Jamaica that are\n\nof horticultural interest.\n Encyclia cochleata\n\n  and   Encyclia fragrans   .\n These were the first two orchids that were taken to Kew Gardens and\n\nwhich were successfully flowered, in 1787 and 1788 respectively.\n It must be recognized that this ability to grow orchids outside their\n\nnatural environment saw an explosion of the study of the orchids and\n\ntheir classification by scientific method.\n Oncidium papilio\n\n  that started the orchid- growing craze in Europe after its ex <l>\n\nhibition at the Crystal Palace in London. \n\n \n\n Broughtonias, Broughtonia sanguinea   and   B. ne <l>\n\ngrilensis   , and the natural hybrid between the two that has\n\nbeen given a commercial name by an American Orchid firm. \n\n \n\nveral colour forms, the most common being red and red/ purple.\n There are also white, cream, yellow and tangerine forms; splash\n\npetal ( white with purple, and yellow with purple) are also known.\n is purple or white.\n\n\n\n \n\n orchids are used in hybridization, especially   O. tri <l>\n\nquetrum, pulchellum   and   tetrapetalum,   but\n\nalso to a lesser extent   gaunlettii   .\n Xylobium\n\npalmifolium, Maxillaria rufescens   var.  minor  ,\n\nand   Epidendrum   species such as   E. difforme\n\n and  E. nutans.   \n\n \n\n  Next it is important to consider the dangers these attractive\n\norchids in Jamaica face, particularly environmental degradation.\n Members of the Jamaica Orchid Society have recently estimated that\n\nmore than 90 of the 237 orchid species in Jamaica are either threatened or\n\nendangered ( Table 2).\n\n\n  Pressure on the orchids comes from the three largest agricultural\n\nenterprises in Jamaica, commercial forestry, large scale coffee\n\nplantations and illegal planting of marihuana.\n Whole hillsides are being cleared of natural vegetation.\n Hardwood and orchids are burnt where they fall!\n In place of virgin woodland, pine and coffee have been planted and\n\nthese do not support orchids at all well.\n For reasons that are not always clear, bare hillsides are not the\n\nones re-cultivated, but hillsides that often contain unique plant life\n\nsuch as Sir John\'s Peak or Foxes Gap.\n Neocogniauxia\n\nmonophylla   is found. \n\n  There are other lesser but pervasive pressures: small scale\n\nfarming, cutting wood, charcoal burning, and expanding settlements; all these\n\ndecrease the natural habitat and destroy the host plants of the\n\nepiphytes.\n In addition there is widespread commercial collecting, sometimes\n\non a massive scale without any thought for the long-term well-being of the\n\norchids.\n Just simply to export as many as possible to earn foreign exchange\n\nfor personal use.\n Even some Orchid Society members have been at the forefront of these\n\nexport drives. \n\n  and\n\nthe natural hybrid were abundant with plants on every tree up to 10\n\nyears ago.\n Now it is possible to find but 4 plants in 4 hours.\n It is a common occurrence to see a huge truck leaving full of trees\n\nthat had been chopped illegally.\n Of course, the orchids are most likely to be found upon the largest\n\nand most mature trees.\n\n\n \n\n  Firstly, it is important that the serious global nature of\n\nthe problem be recognized.\n\n\nfessional environmentalists and NGO\'s all have a part to play.\n The governments have started to play their part with the introduction\n\nof CITES 15 years ago.\n This convention controls trade in certain species of Wildlife; all\n\norchids are included.\n However, it is an unsatisfactory measure, and trade in endangered and\n\nthreatened orchid species continues.\n\n\n  In 1985, the Jamaica Orchid Society with the mining company\n\nAlpart established an orchid reserve at Spur Tree, but this ran into\n\ndifficulty when the company closed its operation in Jamaica.\n The Reserve is now overgrown; although some plants have died and\n\nothers have been stolen, many have successfully been established and\n\nhave started to reproduce.\n More Orchid Reserves are needed, especially in those areas where or\n\n<l> chids are under greatest pressure.\n\n\n  The establishment of National Parks may help.\n There could be large areas of land set aside for nature and this\n\ncould protect plant-life, as well as allowing the public, including tourists,\n\nto visit and enjoy the plants in their natural setting.\n Unfortunately, the Jamaica Orchid Society has not been consulted\n\nin the setting up of the National Parks.\n The Jamaican Forestry Action Plan has also totally ignored the\n\nOrchid Society.  \n\n  Education is a vital aspect of conservation.\n It helps people appreciate what they have, and comprehend the\n\nneed to preserve certain  " bush"  or  " fool-fool wild\n\nflowers"  as well as understand how an individual\'s action can affect\n\nthe environment for good or ill.\n The Orchid Society tries to exert some influence through its monthly\n\nmeetings and its shows twice a year. \n\n \n\n  The heritage of orchids in Jamaica is fascinating, and the plants\n\nare of historic and horticultural interest.\n Some are currently in vogue for hybridization and will attract\n\nvisitors just to see them in their natural habitat.\n Whether our unique orchids survive and prosper or not will be\n\ndetermined by what we all do. \n\n \n\n  The flowering plants ( class Angio-spermae) may be divided into\n\ntwo groups: those with one ( monocotyledons) and those with two\n\nseed-leafs ( dicotyledons).\n Orchids are monocotyledons belonging to the Superorder of Lilies.\n Naturally, therefore, orchids have many typical monocotyledon\n\nfeatures: scattered vessel bundles, parallel leaf venation, flower parts in\n\nthrees, ovary below the petals.\n However, there are only three features that are found in all orchids:\n\n\n\n  1) The stamens are all on one side of the flower rather than\n\nbeing symmetrically arranged.\n\n\n  2) The stamen and pistil are at least partially united.\n In most orchids these parts are completely united into what is\n\nreferred to as the column. \n\n \n\n  There are other features that are found in most orchids; these\n\ninclude:   \n\n  4) The flower usually has a lip or labellum.\n This is really a petal ( the one opposite the fertile stamen) that\n\nhas undergone change through evolution to a specialized landing platform for\n\npollinators. \n\n  5) The flower usually twists around in the course of development.\n The process is known as resupination.\n In the orchid bud, the fertile stamen develops on the side away from\n\nthe stem.\n If the bud merely bent away from the stem the lip would be uppermost\n\nand the fertile stamen would be on the underside of the flower.\n By twisting through 180 degrees, the flower seems to be right way\n\nround. \n\n  6) Part of the stigma ( the rostellum) is usually involved in\n\ntransferring pollen from one flower to the next.\n\n\n  7) The pollen is usually bound together in a few large\n\nmasses which occur in pairs called pollinia. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  , could aptly have\n\nbeen named the land of floral beauty by the Arawaks ( Tainos), whom Columbus\n\nsaw when he cast anchor in 1494. \n\n  Jamaica is blessed with a rich and varied flora, not unlike its\n\npeople, whose ethnic and cultural diversity have been captured in the\n\ncountry\'s national motto,  out of many one people.  \n\n  Over time, the distinction between the indigenous and the\n\nimported have blurred \x13 from the Cassava, the staple food of the Arawaks to\n\nthe Polynesian breadfruit of Captain Bligh\'s mutiny on the Bounty infamy.\n Still, Jamaica\'s impressive collection of over two hundred (\n\n200) species of orchids vie for prominence over the French Bougainvillea, and\n\nthe delicate tracery of the fern complements the perfection of the blood red\n\nanthurium. \n\n  British 17th century physician and naturalist, Hans Sloane, was\n\nso captivated by the beauty of the plant life he saw on his sojourn to the\n\nisland, that he became an ardent collector. \n\n  His collection formed the nucleus of the world renowned British\n\nMuseum of Natural History. \n\n  This publication provides a glimpse of some of the cultural and\n\nhistorical significance of the country\'s distinctive plantlife. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ncially that grown on the slopes of the Blue Mountain Range.\n Coffee labelled Blue Mountain must be grown within a 16-kilometre (\n\n52,496 ft.) radius of the 2,256 metre ( 7,402 ft.) peak. \n\n  Coffee originated in Ethiopia and was eventually taken to the\n\nMediterranean and Western Europe.\n It was introduced into Jamaica in 1728, by a former governor Sir\n\nNicholas Lawes, who planted it at his Temple Hall Plantation in the parish of\n\nSt. Andrew. \n\n  The coffee tree is relatively small, growing to a height of 4.5\n\nmetres ( 14 ft.) with deep green glossy leaves and fragrant white flowers,\n\nwhich look like those of its close relative the Gardenia. \n\n  Berries grow on the limbs in clusters, turning from green to\n\ncherry red when ripe.\n\n\n \n\n  boiling\n\ncoffee in de mawnin, \n\n  I cares for nothing else, the only thing for me is me cup a\n\nboiling coffee in de mawnin.  \n\n \n\n \n\n  According to the Doyenne of Jamaica folklore the Hon.

{'text': "The Protected Areas Resource Conservation ( PARC) Project is\n\na joint effort of the Government of Jamaica and the United States Agency for\n\nInternational Development ( USAID); it is backed by funds amounting to US$2.9\n\nmillion.\n The Nature Conservancy ( TNC), a U.S. non-government\n\norganization, provides the project with technical assistance.\n The overall goal is to conserve Jamaica's biodiversity within a\n\nframework of sustainable development.\n It is thought that this can best be achieved through the creation of\n\nnational parks and other protected areas. \n\n \n\n  1. To establish two pilot national parks \x13 the Montego Bay Marine\n\nPark and the Blue Mountain/John Crow Mountain National Park.\n\n\ngered environments and help to develop much needed local expertise in\n\npark management. \n\n  2. To establish a framework for the development of self-sustaining\n\nparks and protected areas in Jamaica.\n Integral parts of the framework are appropriate legislation,\n\ndata management, financing and identification of sites in need of\n\nprotection. \n\n  The project will also seek to promote appreciation and under\n\n<l> standing of Jamaica's natural heritage. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  The project is implemented through coordinated efforts of\n\ngovernment agencies ( Forestry and Soil Conservation Department, FSCD);\n\nstatutory bodies ( National Resources Conservative Authority, NRCA;\n\nPlanning Institute of Jamaica, PIOJ); environmental non-government\n\norganizations ( the Jamaica Conservation and Development Trust, JCDT;\n\nand TNC); and local advisory and steering committees. \n\n  The PIOJ has the ultimate responsibility for the\n\ncoordination, execution and administration of the project.\n A Project Management Unit has been created for this purpose.\n\n\n\n  BLUE MOUNTAIN / JOHN CROW MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK\n\n  \n\n  The Blue Mountain/John Crow Mountain National Park includes\n\nthe existing Blue Mountain and John Crow Mountain forest reserves.\n This area has a size of over 77,000 hectares and contains seven\n\ndistinct forest types; it represents the largest expanse of continuous\n\nundisturbed forest in Jamaica.\n The Blue Mountain forests have one of the highest levels of endemism\n\nin this hemisphere. \n\n  The FSCD will be working with a Local Advisory Committee to\n\ndevelop management strategies to best conserve and use the site.\n\n\n  - Community outreach programmes have been started in several loca\n\n<l> tions around the proposed park.\n This has already resulted in increased local awareness and sup\n\n<l> port of the project. \n\n  - JCDT and FSCD are jointly improving the infrastructure for\n\nrecreation and tourism along the main trail to Blue Mountain Peak; TNC is pro\n\n<l> viding funds for this part of the programme. \n\n \n\n  The Montego Bay Marine Park encloses over 317 hectares of\n\nprotected area and fish sanctuary.\n The park includes various ecosystems such as coral reefs,\n\nmangroves, and sea grass beds.\n Caribbean coral reefs are among the finest in the world due to\n\noptimal conditions of water salinity, clarity, and temperature.\n They contain spectacular marine invertebrate and fish species;\n\nprovide nursery grounds for the commercial fisheries; and are hosts of many\n\nresident and migrant shore birds. \n\n  The establishment of the park has progressed successfully.\n NRCA is working with a Local Advisory Committee in making\n\nmanagement decisions for the park.\n There is a Park Headquarters located on Cornwall Beach with a Park\n\nManager and staff.\n The park is marked by buoys, and its use by tourists and fishermen is\n\nclosely monitored. \n\n \n\n  All sites proposed for protection have been systematically\n\nexamined and their ecological, cultural, and economic value determined\n\nin a National Parks System Plan.\n This should guarantee that conservation is not restricted\n\nto sites with a high potential for tourism and recreation, but also includes\n\nthose of great biological or historical significance. \n\n  JCDT is responsible for this component of the project;\n\ntechnical advice is provided by TNC.\n A draft plan is presently being developed by Jamaican\n\nconsultants.\n\n\n  - Which sites should be included in a system of protected areas?\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  The goal of the Conservation Data Centre is to compile, organize,\n\nand disseminate biodiversity information in a systematic way, so that it is\n\nreadily accessible to those who need it, especially to governmental and\n\nprivate agencies making decisions on conservation and development is <l>\n\nsues.\n\n\nmunities will be collected from all the sites listed in the National Parks\n\nSystem Plan, and updated on a continuous basis as new information\n\nbecomes available. \n\n  The Conservation Data Centre has been established under a\n\ncooperative agreement between the University of the West Indies, TNC, JCDT,\n\nand PIOJ.\n The University has the primary charge of its operation.\n A steering committee comprised of representatives of the four\n\ncollaborating institutions and the government agencies implementing the\n\npilot parks will provide guidelines for the Centre. \n\n \n\n  The objective of the National Parks Trust Fund is to finance the\n\nmaintenance and operational expenses of a National Parks System over the\n\nlong term.\n In the short term, the fund will take up the recurrent costs of the\n\ntwo pilot parks established through the project.\n The Trust Fund will be capitalized through an initial donation\n\nof US$200,000 from USAID which will be matched by TNC ( providing\n\n$100,000) and JCDT through donations from private sector sources.\n These funds will be used for a debt- for nature swap, the first ever\n\nin Jamaica and the English-speaking Caribbean. \n\n  JCDT is responsible for setting up and managing the Trust Fund.\n It has appointed a Board of Trustees from both private and Government\n\nsectors.\n The target is to capitalize the fund to yield US$200,000 annually, by\n\nthe end of the present phase ( Phase I). \n\n \n\n  Existing legislation including the Beach Control Act of 1956 and\n\nthe Forest Act of 1937 are currently used as the basis for the protection of\n\nmarine and coastal areas and forest reserves.\n However, these laws are outdated, while enforcement under them is lax\n\nor non- existent.\n Therefore, there is a need for new legislation which deals\n\nspecifically with national parks.\n The recently passed NRCA-Act is being carefully examined for its\n\nsuitability to encompass provisions for national parks and protected areas.\n Regulations for national parks and specific Orders relating to the\n\ntwo pilot projects are now being drafted for early submission to\n\nGovernment, and hopefully they will be passed into law very soon. \n\n \n\n  The project has been in progress for some time and it is\n\nestimated that targets set will be reached in time for a successful\n\ncompletion date of August 1992.\n Both pilot parks will be opened in 1992, as the ground work for their\n\nmanagement is proceeding at a feverish pace.\n\n\n  The establishment of national parks and protected areas for\n\nJamaica is not a new idea.\n In fact, two Marine Protected Areas were established, by law, long\n\nbefore the advent of the PARC Project.\n Yet they remained parks on paper only.\n This new project is different: the parks will be properly managed by\n\nappointed staff and there will be rangers in place to enforce legislation.\n\n\n\n  There is another major difference between the PARC Project and\n\nprevious ill-fated initiatives.\n The present efforts are the first in continuing development of\n\nprotected areas in Jamaica, and they are a part of the overall design as\n\nset out in the six components.\n The first three are achievable within a specific time frame; the\n\nothers will help to ensure that these can be sustained.\n USAID has indicated its interest in funding Phase II of the project\n\nif the targets for the current one are met successfully.\n This also signals USAID's appreciation that the development of a\n\nProtected Areas System is a venture in need of prolonged investment\n\nbefore it can become self-sustaining and earn income for the nation. \n\n  The PARC Project is a new beginning.\n It is hoped that it will be a first step in the right direction\n\ntowards the creation and proper management of a system of national parks and\n\nprotected areas for Jamaica.  \n\n\n\n  Montego Bay Marine Park: Protecting a Vital Resource\n\n  \n\n  Montego Bay is the largest tourist resort in Jamaica and the\n\nisland's second city.\n About half of the one million tourists visiting Jamaica each year\n\nstay in and around Montego Bay.\n They generate an estimated one-third of the US$600 million which\n\nJamaica earns annually from tourism.\n Montego Bay's attraction as a tourist destination lies in its\n\nsix beaches, clean coastal waters, coral reefs and other marine life.\n The product being marketed is a beautiful, natural environment.\n This is just one reason why a marine park in Montego Bay is of vital\n\nimportance. \n\n \n\n  The first marine park of the island was initiated by the Jamaica\n\nTourist Board; a 59- hectare area was declared protected under the Beach\n\nControl Act ( Beach Control Order 1974).\n Regulations to govern activities in the park were approved by the\n\nMinistry of Mining and Tourism.\n At the time, the marine park project was viewed by some with\n\nexpectation and optimism.\n It was felt that where previous attempts for an Ocho Rios Marine Park\n\nhad failed for lack of funds, the Cornwall Beach Marine Park would succeed\n\nunder the management of the Jamaica Tourist Board.\n Unfortunately, these expectations were not met: legislation was\n\nnever enforced and most people soon forgot that a park had been declared at\n\nall.\n Yet the exercise proved to be of some value in the end: the\n\nregulations now form the legal basis on which the new and expanded Montego\n\nBay Marine Park will be established. \n\n  Funded by the Organization of American States, a Marine Parks\n\nAction Committee was set up in 1986.\n Management, funding and administrative needs for an operational\n\nMarine National Parks System were evaluated by O'Callaghan, Woodley and Aiken\n\n( 1988).\n Their timely report integrated recommendations on the\n\nestablishment of marine protected areas given by the Jamaica Country\n\nEnvironmental Profile ( CEP 1987), a project funded by USAID.\n This inspired USAID's commitment to the establishment of a National\n\nParks System in Jamaica, and to fund what is now the Protected Areas\n\nResource Conservation ( PARC) Project.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  2. Develop user regulations that ensure the sustainable use\n\nof the protected area. \n\n  3. Set up corps of Park Rangers who will enforce regulations\n\nthrough education whenever possible. \n\n  4. Educate the community about the aims of the Park, its\n\nbenefits and the costs of environmental abuse. \n\n  5. Influence development outside the Park boundaries so that the\n\nPark retains its vitality. \n\n  6. Review current conditions in the Park at the start of the pro\n\n<l> gramme and regularly thereafter in order to evaluate the effective <l>\n\nness of management measures. \n\n  7. Facilitate the recovery of fish populations and benthic\n\nhabitats. \n\n  8. Develop a comprehensive management plan addressing the\n\nissues of zoning, concessions, licensing and other matters. \n\n \n\n  The Montego Bay Marine Park comprises an environmental\n\nprotection and management zone including the 59-hectare plot established\n\nunder the Beach Control Act, Order 1974; and the 258-hectare Bogue Island\n\nLagoon Fish Sanctuary established under the Fishing Industry Act, Order 1979.\n It lies immediately off the coast of Montego Bay and stretches\n\nbetween 1,247 to 6,217 feet from the shoreline.\n\n\n  - the reefs and protected back-reef lagoon lying off Montego\n\nBay's main hotel and beach strip to the south of Montego Point; \n\n  which used to serve as a commercial\n\nharbour is overlooked by the city's centre; \n\n \n\n \n\n  - and the fringing reefs lying off-shore of the Reading\n\nresidential area. \n\n \n\n  There are three main marine ecosystems within the Park:\n\nreefs, mangroves, and sea-grass beds. \n\n  are found in three areas of the\n\nproposed Park: along the airport-hotel strip in the north, the Seawind reef\n\nsystem in the centre; and the Reading or Chalet Caribe reef in the south.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '02de0229-cb4f-48ce-b457-94dd15523bb5', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.412355+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9526117444038391, 'non_english_score': 0.04738825559616089}
{'text': 'The Blue Swallowtail and other Butterflies in Rozelle\n\n  \n\n \n\n<O> six-photographs <O>\n\n  Jamaica is the home of 120 species of butterflies including seven\n\nswallowtails.\n Swallowtails are among the larger and more colourful butterflies\n\nworldwide.\n They are so named because the hindwings have extended tips called\n\ntails.\n ) and the\n\nGiant Swallowtail (  Papilio homerus  ) are found only in Jamaica.\n The Natural History Society of Jamaica has adopted the Blue\n\nSwallowtail as its logo. \n\n \n\n  was first illustrated by Sir Hans Sloane in\n\n1725.\n Sloane you may recall, was the physician of Duke Abermale, former\n\nGovernor of Jamaica and one of our naturalists in the 1700\'s. \n\n  The Natural History Society started collecting information on the\n\nBlue Swallowtail and other butterflies of Jamaica since its inception in the\n\n1940\'s and these records are published in the Natural History Notes.\n Early observers of the Blue Swallowtail included Captain D. J. N.\n\nWalker of Up Park Camp, students of Jamaica College, and C. B. Lewis of the\n\nInstitute of Jamaica. \n\n  In the 1940\'s and 50\'s it was not unusual to see large numbers of\n\n Eurytides  flying in the vicinity of Jamaica College, Half Way Tree\n\nand Long Mountain.\n In 1953, C.B. Lewis reported seeing thousands of butterflies flying\n\nfrom east to west on May 31 through to June 2. \n\n \n\n  During the 60\'s and 70\'s, the Blue Swallowtail seemed to have\n\ndeclined dramatically though few people took notice of it.\n In the early 1980\'s interest in the Blue Swallowtail was revived and\n\nthe only known breeding site in Rozelle, St. Thomas was visited by members of\n\nthe Society.\n The team was led by Dr. Thomas Farr who later published the\n\ndescription of the fifth stage ( instar) caterpillar in the Natural History\n\nNotes. \n\n  Soon after this visit, members of the society discussed the need\n\nfor a detailed study of the ecology and biology of the butterfly and\n\nconsequently a proposal was written and possible funding sources examined.\n Negotiations were also held with the managers of the Coptic Farms in\n\nSt. Thomas on the preservation of the breeding site.\n The project was shelved due to lack of manpower and financial\n\nresources needed to implement it. \n\n  In November 1990 when Dr. Eric Garraway and myself began a\n\ndetailed study of the Giant Swallowtail, we also set out to gather\n\ninformation on the life history of as many butterfly species as possible.\n Among them was the Blue Swallowtail.\n Time did not allow us to begin our search for the Blue Swallowtail\n\nuntil June 1992. \n\n \n\n  On the morning of June 17, 1992 we departed for Rozelle.\n We were accompanied by Dr. Margaret Hodges, a participant in the\n\nprevious Natural History Society trip.\n Margaret remarked that she remembered very little \x13 but throughout\n\nthe day what appeared to be unimportant information to her, proved otherwise.\n\n\n\n  On arriving in Rozelle, we made our way up a dirt road that led\n\nto the more forested areas.\n The team was halted by a flash of blue, as a butterfly swooped to the\n\nground.\n , we parked the\n\nvehicles and went in search of the butterfly.\n We soon found the bright blue and black butterfly perched in the\n\nroad.\n\n\n  We drove up the road for a few more minutes before we decided to\n\ncontinue on foot.\n As we hiked, we searched every tree that looked like the\n\ncaterpillar\'s food plant, Black Lancewood (  Oxandra lanceolata  ) .\n\n\n\n \n\nAnteos maerula maerula  was seen drinking from recent deposits of cow\n\ndung ( at least twelve were observed at one site) and  Battus polydamus\n\njamaicensis  seemed to be enjoying the nectar of Orange Sage ( \n\nLantana camara  ) .\n , by far the most abundant of the species in\n\nthe area glided lazily in and out of the shrubs while  Marpesia eleucha\n\npellenis  hovered in the distance over shrubs and trees.\n and\n\n Anaea troglodyta portia.  \n\n  We hiked for what seemed like forever, until the road narrowed\n\ninto a track.\n We thought of abandoning the trip but on Margaret\'s persistence we\n\ncontinued. \n\n  At about noon, we arrived at what seemed to be a small farm.\n An area of the forest was sealed off by a gate made from barbed wire\n\nand thin logs.\n We had encountered such barriers before in the Rio Grande Valley,\n\nwhere small farmers seal off areas of the forest for cattle rearing, so we\n\nassumed we could let ourselves in.\n Soon after that, we came across a stand of trees which looked\n\nfamiliar to Margaret and our search of all branches began in earnest;  \'at\n\neyelevel\'  according to Margaret. \n\n \n\n  \n\n  Success came shortly after, when the stillness of the air was\n\ninterrupted by an excited voice announcing a caterpillar find.\n caterpillar and we were now\n\ncertain of the foodplant.\n With more adrenaline flowing through our veins we searched branch\n\nafter branch.\n Soon we became familiar with the location of the caterpillars which\n\nwere found resting singly,  \'at eyelevel\'  , and on the upper\n\nsurfaces of leaves or stems. \n\n  At the end of the search we had nine caterpillars with a range of\n\ncolours.\n We found out later that there are three colour forms of the\n\ncaterpillar; thus the caterpillar is showing colour polymorphism. \n\n  Though we were pleased that we encountered these butterflies we\n\nwere still hoping to see large numbers of Blue Swallowtail recorded in the\n\n1940\'s and 50\'s, but this was not to be.\n which\n\nstopped at a flower to feed.\n One did not escape the net of the collector and was photographed and\n\nreleased. \n\n  Dynamine egaea egaea\n\n , various  Eurema  species, some blues,  Dione vanillae\n\ninsularis, Pyrgus oileus, Adelpha abyla,  more  Mestra dorcas \n\nand numerous tortoise beetles and fiddler beetles ( sometimes called\n\npoliceman beetle (  Exopthalmus  spp.).\n As we neared the end of the dirt road we caught sight of pupa and\n\nstopped to investigate.\n We discovered 21 pupae of this kind ( three different colour forms),\n\ngreen caterpillars feeding on a legume, two pale purple caterpillars feeding\n\non  Passiflora perfoliata  ( of the Passion fruit family), and brown\n\niridescent caterpillars feeding on Blue Vervain (  Stachytarpheta \n\nspp.).\n We collected all pupae and caterpillars along with larval food plant.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Exhausted, but satisfied with our find we departed Rozelle and\n\nheaded for Kingston.\n On returning to the laboratory, we placed the caterpillars and pupae\n\nin plastic cages which contained moist paper towel and waited patiently for\n\nmetamorphosis to occur.\n\n\n  emerged within 7-10\n\ndays after pupation but one did not emerge until four months later.\n This adult emerged after the pupa was placed in contact with the\n\nmoist paper towel. \n\n  All twenty-one pupae died.\n ( Family:\n\nChalcidae) emerged from each of twenty pupae collected and one pupa was\n\npreyed on by an unknown predator.\n\n\nPhoebis  spp. \n\n  The butterflies produced from the brown iridescent, pale purple\n\nand green caterpillars were  Junonia genoveva  ( Buckeye), \n\nHeliconius charitonius simulator  ( Zebra) and  Anteos maerula\n\nmaerula  respectively. \n\n \n\n  For avid and prospective butterfly observers Rozelle provides a\n\nwide variety of species which can be found in lowland areas.\n It is also less than an hour\'s drive from Kingston and interested\n\npersons need only spend half a day on a collecting/ photographing trip.\n The road to the forest though not paved, was drivable until after the\n\nheavy rains of May 1993.\n However, the trail to the forest is very good.\n The area is very hot and dry and collectors must equip themselves\n\nwith plenty water. \n\n  We will continue to visit Rozelle as time allows but we hope that\n\nthose interested in learning more about Jamaican butterflies and other\n\ninsects will join us on future trips.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Termites are distributed mainly in the tropics with species\n\ninhabiting forests and structures associated with human habitation.\n This chronic association has inspired numerous studies of the biology\n\nand control of termites.\n Intensive studies of Jamaica\'s termites commenced at the University\n\nof the West Indies in 1986. \n\n  The termites ( order Isoptera) consist of five families:\n\nMastotermitidae, Hodotermitidae, Rhinotermitidae, Kalotermitidae and\n\nTermitidae.\n The first four families are collectively termed lower termites, while\n\nspecies of the family Termitidae are referred to as higher or advanced\n\ntermites. \n\n \n\n  Termites are commonly referred to as white ants and in Jamaica,\n\nthey are colloquially called duck ants or chi-chi.\n This erroneous classification of termites as ants arises from their\n\nsuperficial resemblance.\n Two simple diagnostic features that may be used to distinguish\n\ntermites are 1) their soft and generally white bodies and 2) the absence of a\n\n " waist"  ( constriction between the thorax and abdomen).\n\n\n\n  There are seventeen species of termites in Jamaica ( see Box).\n In contrast to many other animal groups, none of these species are\n\nendemic to the island but also occur in other regions.\n\n\n  Kalotermitidae are collectively called drywood termites.\n As the name implies, they inhabit wood which provides both shelter\n\nand food.\n These species of termites are well-known to man because they\n\nvoraciously consume domestic and commercial items containing cellulose ( eg.\n\nfurniture and wooden frames of buildings).\n is the most common pest of building timber.\n The ingested wood particles are digested by flagellated protozoa (\n\nspecific to lower termites and their ancestors).\n The excrement of frass is released as small, dry pellets, which\n\nfilters through the holes of the wood.\n These pellets are used as indicators of the presence of drywood\n\ntermites. \n\n  Rhinotermitidae consist of the popular subterranean and damp-wood\n\ntermites.\n Subterranean termites build nests below the surface of the ground\n\nfrom which they radiate in search of food.\n They are rarely seen, but their presence can be confirmed by their\n\ntrails that provide an indispensable link with the moist underground.\n The often complicated nests have many different parts and house\n\nlarge populations.\n The parent nest is the original nest containing the reproductives.\n The subsidiary nests constructed after the completion of the parent\n\nnest are usually designated for various functions such as brood chambers and\n\nfood reserves.\n Multi- regional nests with specialized sections offers many escape\n\nroutes and enhance the resilience of subterranean termites to insecticides.\n However, interaction between nests facilitates the spread of\n\nintroduced toxic substances. \n\n  Termitidae include the arboreal termites which also construct\n\nlarge, complex multi-regional nests with intricately designed walls.\n Nests are not restricted to trees but are built on walls and roofs\n\nof buildings.\n These nests grow to very large sizes to accommodate the continuously\n\nincreasing colony.\n , which is found\n\nin diverse habitats of Jamaica.\n The behaviour and social system of the family Termitidae are more\n\ncomplex and highly organized than in the lower termites; consequently, they\n\nare capable of more efficient foraging, defence of nests and regulation of\n\ncolony size. \n\n \n\n  All termites exhibit the highest form of sociality known in\n\nanimals; the system ( termed eusociality) is characterized by the presence of\n\na non-reproductive caste (  " workers"  ,  " soldiers"\n\n and other specialists), overlapping adult generations and\n\ncooperative brood care.\n The non- reproductive individuals develop from fertilized eggs; this\n\nis different from the social Hymenopterans ( bees, ants, social wasps) where\n\nthe workers develop from unfertilised eggs. \n\n  The non-reproductive castes forgo reproduction of their own;\n\ninstead they stay in the parent nest and help their mother and father to rear\n\nadditional brothers and sisters.\n\n\n  Nine different castes have been identified in termite colonies,\n\nbut the full complement never occur simultaneously in a single nest.\n Immature termites can be separated into two group depending upon the\n\npresence of wings into apterous ( wingless) and brachypterous nymphs; these\n\ntwo forms are also called larvae and nymphs, respectively.\n The remaining castes are referred to as adults because of their\n\npotential for further development and are subdivided into sterile and\n\nreproductive individuals.\n Both groups are morphologically and physiologically adapted for\n\nspecific functions.\n Super-specialization of castes enables greater efficiency in the\n\nexecution of jobs and ultimately enhances the success of colonies.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5b42a175-768f-40b0-a143-01ab5358834f', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.413671+00:00', 'english_score': 0.96163409948349,

{'text': 'DESPITE its relative scarcity, water remains one of the most\n\npoorly managed resources throughout the world, with waste occurring even when\n\nwater supply has declined significantly. \n\n \n\naged by subsidy.\n However, waste occurs because of many other factors.\n These include inaccurate meters, leaking pipes, blockages with\n\n<l> in the system, dripping faucets, running toilets, and wasteful prac <l>\n\ntices such as the excessive amounts of water for bathing, washing clothes and\n\nutensils, watering lawns on hot days, or using drinking-quality water to\n\nwash cars, or water golf courses. \n\n  The general response to the water problem has been the\n\nbuilding of more dams.\n Yet, studies have concluded that this does not reduce\n\nwastefulness and that investments in water efficiency , recycling and\n\nconservation may yield more usable water per dollar than the building of\n\ndams.\n For example, thermal power plants can cut their requirements by almost\n\n98 per cent using recycled water.\n It may be prudent to concentrate on efforts such as the UWI ( Mona)\n\nwater recycling project. \n\n  As the Jamaican population increases and becomes more\n\nsophisticated, household water use will also increase.\n For example, in the United States, the average US citizen uses\n\nabout 2,000 gallons of water a day.\n Less than five per cent of this amount is used for drinking and\n\ncooking.\n The remaining 95 per cent goes to appliances, consumer goods, to\n\nwater lawns and golf courses, and for pools. \n\n  In Jamaica, water closets are still absent in many homes, yet\n\nmost of the toilets in Jamaica waste a lot of water.\n\n\n  Water quality in the Corporate Area and other urban centres also\n\ndeclined as the population grew.\n On average, a city of one million people uses about 625,000 gallons\n\nof water daily and produces about 500,000 tons of sewage; the remaining\n\n125,000 tons are wasted or consumed. \n\n \n\n  The growing demand for water has also led to greater exploitation\n\nof groundwater.\n The results, world-wide, include lowered water tables, increased\n\npumping costs, reduced surface flows, salt water intrusion and land\n\nsubsidence. \n\n  Studies have shown that when water is withdrawn from an acquif\n\n<l> er much faster than it can be replenished, this could lower the\n\nfresh water table below sea level, and in coastal areas could cause salt\n\nwater intrusion. \n\n  Heavily stressed groundwater resources also result in land\n\nsubsidence, so that as water is withdrawn without replacement,\n\nunderground clays and other materials compact, causing the land above to\n\nsink.\n This may result in damage to buildings, streets and sewage systems.\n\n\n\n  Experts argue that the failure to value water according to its\n\nreal worth, has contributed to its inefficient use.\n It is argued that while most citizens could quote the price of a\n\ngallon or litre of gasoline they have no real idea what they pay for 1,000\n\ngallons of water. \n\n  Additionally, it has been recognised that water, unlike oil,\n\nhas no intrinsic monetary value, so that water policies in most countries\n\ntend to discourage efficiency by subsidizing water.\n It is believed that when water is more realistically priced,\n\nGovernment regulates its use, or the cost of extracting it goes up,\n\nefficiency is increased. \n\n  The recent 100 per cent hike in water rates by the National Water\n\nCommission could be deemed a latent attempt to price water at its real\n\nvalue.\n Others may argue that it was a mere attempt by the NWC to cover its\n\nown inefficiencies. \n\n  Surface and groundwater quality are also faced with the problems\n\nof deforestation, agricultural expansion, urbanisation, and industriali\n\n<l> sation. \n\n  In Jamaica, deforestation is a major problem.\n Thus, over the years water supply in the Kingston Metropolitan\n\nArea ( KMA) has been affected by prolonged dry periods.\n The watershed surrounding both the Mona Reservoir and the Hermitage\n\nDam have been destroyed.\n In fact, about 19 of the island\'s watersheds are reportedly in\n\ncritical condition. \n\n \n\n  Deforestation disturbs soil permeability.\n It increases runoff and erosion.\n Soil impermeability decreases the amount of water available\n\nduring dry seasons, and causes mountain springs to dry up and become\n\nseasonal. \n\n  In Jamaica there is an average soil loss of 80 tons per year in\n\nsome watersheds.\n Many rivers, over the last 60 years, no longer flow on the surface\n\nfor an entire year.\n Those which flow, do so with reduced volumes, especially during\n\ndry periods. \n\n  The development of large urban areas has also had a negative im\n\n<l> pact on water resources.\n Rainwater runoff increases as roof tops, paved streets and parking\n\nlots channel water into sewer and drain systems, instead of allowing it to\n\nsoak into the ground. \n\n  The quality of water is also affected by automobile\n\nemissions, construction residue, street refuse, and organic residues from\n\nanimals and vegetation. \n\n  The quality of ground and surface water are also affected by the\n\ndumping of chemical waste.\n Unfortunately, most water treatment plants around today were not\n\ndesigned to filter hazardous wastes. \n\n  Water quality is also damaged by the demand for energy from\n\nelectrical generating plants, which use large quantities of water for\n\ncooling.\n Water is withdrawn from rivers or the ocean and pumped through con\n\n<l> densers at these plants before being returned to its source 10 degrees\n\ncelsius warmer.\n Findings indicate that the consequences for equatic ecosystems may be\n\nextremely adverse. \n\n  Water policies must change to reflect the true value of water.\n This, it is believed, will encourage conservation and\n\nre-allocation to the most efficient uses.\n Increasing competition for a limited water supply, combined\n\nwith the rising economic and environmental costs of traditional water\n\nstrategies, requires a new approach to water management.\n Existing policies are inadequate and are often politically rather\n\nthan economically motivated. \n\n  The experts believe that if water use policies are redefined to\n\nmake waste economically disadvantageous, conservation could become the\n\nmost efficient source of  " new"  water.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  THE carrot originated in Europe and adjoining portions of Asia\n\nand is a biennial herb with a swollen tap-root and fernlike foliage.\n\n\n \n\n  Carrots are classified according to the shape and length of the\n\nroot.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  are\n\nDanvers 126, Danvers Half Long, Imperator, Chantenay and Nanates. \n\n \n\n  Carrots will thrive on most soil types and on soils which are too\n\npoor for many other vegetables, but they develop best in deep, loose, well\n\ndrained sandy loams or loams with a slightly acid reaction.\n When grown on heavy soils, they produce abundant leaf with growth and\n\nroots which are poorly shaped and difficult to prepare for cooking. \n\n  Carrots can be grown throughout the year at high and low\n\nelevation but the best crops are obtained during the cool winter and spring\n\nseasons.\n\n\n \n\n  The soil should be well prepared to a very fine tilth and to a\n\ndepth of at least 12" as carrot seeds are very fine and the seedlings grow\n\nslowly.\n Fertiliser applications should be based on soil analyses as the re\n\n<l> quirement varies with soil type, soil fertility, previous fertilisation\n\nand rotation.\n As a general guide a N.P.K. mixture e.g. 11-22-22 or 14-28-14 can be\n\napplied at a rate of 1 cwt ( hundred weight)/acre and may be done when the\n\nplants are 4"-6" high.\n\n\nlates hairiness or branching of the roots. \n\n \n\n  Four to five pounds of seeds are required to establish an acre of\n\nthe crop.\n The seed should be sown in rows 18"-24" apart.\n If sowing is by hand, the seeds should be mixed with dry sand at a\n\nrate of one part of seed to six ( 6) parts of sand.\n Seeds should then be distributed in 4" wide rows so that the carrots\n\nwill later stand 2 to 3 abreast in the row and thinning will not be\n\nnecessary.\n Germination of carrot seeds is slow and irregular and seedling growth\n\nis quite weak, and as such, heavy soils that crust badly should not be used\n\nfor carrot production.\n Transplanting of seedlings is advisable as the mature tubers\n\nfrom these plants will be deformed as a result of the disturbance of the root\n\nsystem. \n\n \n\n  During the early portion of the growth season when weed control\n\nis necessary, mechanical control is difficult because of the size of the\n\nseedlings.\n On small plots, weeding may be done by hand but at commercial\n\nplanting this is too expensive.\n Chemical control by the use of stoddard solvent after the first true\n\nleaves have formed is recommended.\n\n\ntures of 80 degree Fahrenheit.\n 60-80 gallons of spray is required per acre.\n at\n\n2lb-3lb per acre may also be used for weed control. \n\n  Shallow inter-row cultivation will control weeds between rows and\n\nmoulding is necessary to prevent greening of the carrot tops. \n\n \n\n  virus, stunt plants\n\nand occasionally causes serious damage.\n It is transmitted by leaf hoppers and control is effected by\n\nspraying with  malathion, perfeckthion or sevin  to control the\n\ninsect.\n\n\n  i) Leaf Blight \x13 Control with Dithane M45, Manzate and Anthracol,\n\nZineb or a Cupromaneb fungicide at 2 ½ lb/acre or Daconil at 2 lb/acre. \n\n  ii) Leaf Spot \x13Control by spraying with Kocide, Dithane M45 or\n\nBenlate \n\n \n\n \n\n  Insects pest include ( i) Cutworms \x13 Control with basudin,\n\ndiazinon. \n\n  ( ii) Leaf hoppers \x13 Control with Malathion, Diazinon,\n\nDimethoate or Sevin. \n\n  Root knot nematodes can be severe on carrot rots causing\n\nthe production of galls, reducing yield and making the roots\n\nunattractive.\n Soil may be treated with a suitable nematicide as recommended\n\nby Extension Officers. \n\n \n\n  The crop takes 120-135 days to mature.\n When the carrots are reaped, the tops should be removed and the\n\ntubers washed and aired in the shade.\n Topping greatly reduces weight loss of roots, and washing reduces\n\nrotting and spoilage during storage.\n\n\nenheit and above 95% relative humidity. \n\n \n\nmitted by the Technology Transfer and Inter-Agency Co-ordination Division,\n\nRural

{'text': 'The amount of the B Vitamins we need vary for each one.\n In general, we need very small amount of each of these vitamins.\n\n\n  ( B1),\n\nriboflavin ( B2) and niacin ( B3) we need are based on the amount of energy\n\nwe expend.\n Our requirements for them are therefore directly linked to our energy\n\n( calories) intake.\n The amounts needed vary between 0.5-1 milligram per 1000 calories.\n Niacin and vitamin B6 requirements are also related to an adequate\n\nintake of high quality protein.\n Proteins of animal origin ( except gelatin) and cereal/legume blends\n\noffer protein of high quality. \n\n  The needs for these vitamins rise rapidly during the growing\n\nyears.\n Teenagers are very active and need more than adults.\n An adult male ingesting about 3,000 calories would need 1.5\n\nmilligrams of thiamine and riboflavin and about 3 milligrams of pre-formed\n\nniacin daily.\n He needs about 2 milligrams of B6, and 2 micrograms each of folacin\n\nand B12.\n The term pre-formed simply means that niacin, already in the food can\n\nbe used directly by the body.\n\n\n  Note however, that when you look at a table of Recommended\n\nDietary Allowances for nutrients you will see that about five times more\n\nvitamins than is actually required, is listed to ensure a good margin of\n\nsafety.\n Also the adult male is taken as the reference individual as his\n\ncalorie intake and hence vitamin requirements are greatest.\n The active, fast developing teenager would require similar amounts.\n There is also an extra demand for the B vitamins during pregnancy and\n\nlactation but the woman should not gain too much weight.\n It is desirable that she fills her vitamin needs through a good\n\nsupply of fruits, vegetables and modest amounts of low fat dairy products,\n\nlean meat and fish. \n\n \n\n  The adult male could fill his thiamine requirements by eating 3\n\nounces ( 90    grams   ) of lean pork,1/2 cup\n\nstewed gungo/pigeon peas, 1 cup of cooked oats and 1 dumpling or roti made\n\nfrom 2 ounces ( 50 grams) enriched wheat flour.\n Adding a fresh fruit such as watermelon or sweetsop/sugar apple or\n\norange and a raw vegetable salad would substantially increase his intake of\n\nthiamine.\n His niacin needs would be met and surpassed and his riboflavin\n\nrequirement filled if the oatmeal was made with 1 cup milk or 25 grams of\n\nmilk powder.\n By the time he would have completed his day\'s meals he would have\n\nexcesses of all three vitamins. \n\n  The man\'s vitamins B6 needs would be met too and so would his\n\nneed for folacin, ( one of the six well known B vitamins) especially if\n\nanother green vegetable such as steamed callaloo/spinach or a pepper pot soup\n\nbased on  \'greens\'  was added.\n Including a ripe banana and a small serving of liver could ensure an\n\nexcess of these vitamins and an adequacy of vitamin B12.  p>\n Vitamin B12 is found mostly in animal products such as meat, fish,\n\npoultry, eggs, milk and other dairy products.\n Yeast grown in a vitamin B12\x13enriched environment is a good source of\n\nthe vitamin.\n Remember we need very, very small amounts of vitamins so let\'s eat\n\nfoods and not take pills to meet our vitamin needs.\n Also if we wish to get these vitamins without ingesting too\n\nmany calories we need to have more leafy <unclear> one

ago. \n\n  Dr. Henry Lowe, Chief Executive Officer, Blue Cross ( JA) Ltd in\n\nan interview with the  Sunday Gleaner  said that brand name drugs\n\ninvolved many years of research, sometimes as many as 20 years, and therefore\n\nwere very expensive.\n Companies producing brand name drugs have to ensure that they are\n\nsafe and state what the known side effects are.\n These are tested in hospitals and clinics before being approved for\n\nhuman consumption and could cost up to\n\n$20 million.  \n\n  In order to recover the amount spent, companies are given\n\nlicenses ( patent rights) for between 15-20 years, depending on the country\n\nof origin.\n At the end of this period anyone is free to manufacture these drugs\n\nbut they cannot be called by the same name as the brand name.\n Generic drugs, therefore, are legitimate drugs that are tried\n\nand proven and should not be seen as of inferior quality. \n\n  One of the problems of acceptance of generic drugs in\n\nJamaica is a cultural one, Dr. Lowe said.\n Many persons are accustomed to a particuclar shape and colour\n\ntablet which is either different in colour or shape sometimes refused to\n\naccept it.\n A massive education programme is therefore needed to correct this.\n\n\n\n  Regarding quality control, each country is responsible to see\n\nthat standards are maintained.\n In the 1970s there were some bad experiences with generic drugs\n\ncoming out of Eastern Europe, and this increased the scepticism that many,\n\nincluding doctors, have of generic drugs.\n However, the Caribbean Drug Testing Laboratory at Hope Gardens ,\n\nwhich is controlled by the Government chemist tests all drugs coming into the\n\nisland. \n\n \n\n  According to another source, one of the problems with the\n\nacceptance of generic drugs is resistance by doctors and pharmacists, because\n\nof monetary gains.\n Generic drugs, cost on average, 20% cheaper than brand name drugs.\n Eighty per cent of the drugs dispensed in England are generic and the\n\nUnited States is now pushing to go that route. \n\n  The source implied that some doctors preferred to prescribe brand\n\nname drugs, because some companies offer holidays abroad. \n\n  On the other hand, when the pharmacists mark up 40% of a brand\n\nname drug it\'s much more than 40% of a generic drug.\n\n\n  Government is now finalising legislation to ensure that\n\npharmacists may, if the doctor does not state, substitute generic drug. \n\n  A survey done a year ago showed that only 20% of doctors were\n\nwilling to prescribe generic drugs, but that figure has now moved to\n\nabout 70% because the number of patients seen by GPs at their office had\n\nfallen between 30%- 50%, as patients cannot afford medical fees plus the high\n\ncost of drugs. \n\n  generi\n\n  generic      drugs   .\n\n\n  The problem with resistance, according to Dr. Morrison varies.\n\n\nneric houses do not advertise like brand name drugs, which are placed on the\n\nmarket because they are well known.\n Also, because generic drugs are called by a different name than\n\nthe brand names, doctors, by force of habit tended to write the brand\n\nname drugs.\n The burden, he feels, rests with pharmacists to let patients\n\nknow that generic drugs are available. \n\n  He pointed out that doctors could acquaint themselves with the\n\nnames of generic drugs by getting a copy of the booklet published by Blue\n\nCross called  " Generic formulae"  . \n\n  Dr. Morrison also pointed to the scepticism developed about\n\ngeneric drugs because of the experiences of the 1970s. \n\n \n\n  He said that some pharmacists may tell a patient that they have\n\nto dispense what the doctor prescribes, but, according to Dr. Morri <l>\n\nson they are not duty bound to do so.\n He feels that in order to circumvent this problem, doctors could\n\nuse pads stamped  " generic drugs may be substituted"  when\n\nprescribing drugs. \n\n  A survey done recently showed that generic drugs were postured as\n\ncheaper and therefore have developed a socio-economic stigma.\n It showed that downtown pharmacists dispensed more generic drugs as\n\nagainst uptown pharmacists, and that rural doctors prescribed more generic\n\ndrugs than their urban counterparts. \n\n  It\'s important, Dr. Morrison feels, that patients are aware that\n\ngeneric    drugs   are not inferior, as even in\n\nthe public health sector, patients are sent to purchase drugs outside the\n\nsystem.\n With less money available, Government should make every\n\neffort to bring in more generic drugs. \n\n  contacted Miss Grace Allen, head,\n\nPharmaceutical Division of the Ministry of Health to get the\n\nGovernment\'s side. \n\n  She explained that the Ministry of Health buys generic drugs via\n\ntender through the Jamaica Commodities Trading Company, with tenders\n\ngoing up to 100-120 suppliers all around the world.\n This way the Government obtained the best prices \x13 sometimes on gener\n\n<l> ic, sometimes on brand names.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  In an age where young people are more prone to heart diseases and\n\nother ills, Jamaica\'s young people have become increasingly health conscious.\n\n\n\n  One of the areas in which they have become more conscious is in\n\ntheir consumption of hard liquor.\n Reports are that young people ranging between ages 18 to 25 are\n\nsipping beers, shandy, stout and an occasional glass of wine.\n Very few of them are drinking gin, brandy, whiskey, vodka or rum.\n\n\n\n  But the Distillers of Canada in a magazine report are arguing\n\nthat all liquors may be different but they are equal in terms of consumption.\n The report stated that appearances can be deceiving as beer, wine and\n\nspirits look different, but they are identical in this basic way: 12 ounces\n\nof regular beer, 5 ounces of table wine and 1.5 ounce of spirits all contain\n\nthe same amount of alcohol. \n\n  This is good to know, the report stated because if you are paying\n\nmore attention to what you drink these days, you ought to realize just what\'s\n\nin your glass. \n\n  on Thursday,\n\nMr. Bibsy Millwood, sales manager at Edwin Charley, a subsidiary of J. Wray\n\nand    Nephew said   young women were\n\nconsuming mainly wines such as those imported from Germany, France and Italy\n\nas well as liquors such as Bailey\'s Irish Cream while, young men ranging\n\nbetween ages 20 and 30 were drinking mainly beers. \n\n  He said many young people have for a long time not been attracted\n\nto hard liquors such as Rum, Vodka, Scotch and Gin which were consumed\n\nmainly by persons over 30 years. \n\n  Public Relations Manager at Desnoes and Geddes, Tony Rae\n\nattributed this to the increasing level of health consciousness among\n\nyoung people.\n He said the general feeling among young people was that whereas they\n\ncould consume more of a brewed product, it did not have the same effect on\n\nthem as consuming a cue of rum.\n is\n\nalso said to enhance young people\'s ability to socialise longer, he said.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Meanwhile, Senior Marketing Manager at J. Wray and Nephew, Mr.\n\nPatrick Gillings said it was found that hard spirits were consumed by\n\nmore mature people while with the younger people \x13 while some drank hard\n\nspirits \x13 many went for beers, sodas and wine. \n\n  He said the key factor determining this was the level of\n\nsocialising that each individual had as well as the cost factor involved.\n\n\n\n  He said traditionally at the lower end of the society young\n\npeople were not fond of going into the bars as it was felt that it was a\n\nplace for the  " bigger men"  in the society. \n\n  " Further up the socio-economic ladder there are places\n\nsuch as night clubs where more socialising takes place and they may then make\n\na transition to hard spirits such as rum and mixters,"  he said. \n\n  Mr. Gillings attributed this transition to the exposure to\n\nhigh    liquor   consumption in a club environ\n\n<l> ment.\n He said when young people began to integrate in the working\n\nenvironment their drinking attitudes began to change.\n The transition to hard liquor he said often began between age 25\n\nand 26. \n\n  Citing another reason why young people were drinking more sodas,\n\nbeers, stout and wine, he said, the affordability of these caused young\n\npeople between ages 18 to 25 to opt for such a choice. \n\n  In addition, society has led people to believe that one could get\n\ndrunk a lot easier it they drank hard liquors rather than regular consumption\n\nof beers, he said referring to a United States report which stated that to\n\nthe breathalyser they were all the same.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5a2523be-9b26-4729-a473-6f54abd384f5', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.416879+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9778833985328674, 'non_english_score': 0.02211660146713257}
{'text': 'In recognition of the strategic importance of the energy sector to\n\nthe country\'s economic growth and development, an Energy Policy has been\n\ndeveloped.\n The Jamaican economy is not well endowed with petroleum based energy\n\nresources and therefore exhibits a strong dependence on imports.\n In comparison with countries at a similar stage of development, the\n\nlevel of energy requirement in Jamaica is fairly high.\n This can be attributed primarily to the requirements of the\n\nbauxite/alumina industry which is highly energy intensive.\n The policy seeks to diversify Jamaica\'s energy base with the aim of\n\nensuring an adequate and secure energy supply for Jamaica. \n\n  Within this Energy Policy, issues relating to energy sources such\n\nas petroleum, renewables and other fuels are addressed.\n In keeping with the Government of Jamaica\'s commitment to deregulate\n\nand liberalize the Jamaican economy, the involvement of the private sector on\n\na competitive basis is chosen as the best way to modernize and expand the\n\nenergy sector, so as to achieve the required growth in energy supplies and to\n\nimprove efficiencies in energy production. \n\n  Based on the nation\'s projection of economic growth, it is\n\nestimated that approximately 400 megawatts ( MW) of new generating capacity\n\nwill be required over the next ten ( 10) years in the electricity sector.\n This will offer opportunities for the participation of the private\n\nsector.\n\n\n  The petroleum sector, which satisfies approximately ninety ( 90%)\n\npercent of the nation\'s energy needs, is supplied by Petrojam Limited, a\n\nsmall hydro-skimming refinery and a network of international and local\n\nmarketing companies.\n The efficiency and capability of the refinery to produce some\n\nproducts in adequate quantities is limited by its technology, size and age.\n If the refinery is to address these short-comings, it would have to\n\nbe modernized, upgraded or expanded.\n This can only be achieved through new investment, more than the\n\npublic sector can afford.\n Therefore, joint venture collaboration is needed in the petroleum\n\nsector. \n\n \n\n\n\n  a) ensure stable and adequate energy supplies at the least\n\neconomic cost in a deregulated and liberalized environment; \n\n  b) diversify the energy base and encourage the development\n\nof indigenous energy resources where economically viable and technically\n\nfeasible; and ensure the security of energy supplies; \n\n  c) encourage efficiency in energy production, conversion and use\n\nwith the overall objectives of reducing the energy intensity of the economy;\n\n\n\n  d) complement the country\'s Industrial Policy recognizing\n\nthe importance of energy as a critical input to industrial growth and\n\nstability; \n\n  e) minimize the adverse environmental effects and pollution\n\ncaused by the production, storage, transport and use of energy, and minimize\n\nenvironmental degradation as a result of the use of fuelwood; and \n\n  f) establish an appropriate regulatory framework to protect\n\nconsumers, investors and the environment. \n\n  2. These objectives will be achieved by creating an\n\nenabling environment to:  \n\n  a) encourage private sector participation and investments through\n\na policy of divestment and an appropriate regulatory framework conducive to\n\nnew investment; \n\n  b) promote the development of indigenous energy sources where\n\nappropriate, technically and economically feasible; \n\n  c) encourage energy conservation/efficiency on the supply side as\n\nwell as demand side management; \n\n  d) fully protect the environment while ensuring that adequate\n\nenergy supplies are available to the country and to sustain the desired rate\n\nof economic growth, and at the same time, stimulate industrial development by\n\nencouraging synergies from co-generation; and \n\n  e) maintain appropriate institutional arrangements to ensure\n\nthat the stated objectives are achieved. \n\n \n\n  Currently, all the generation, transmission and\n\ndistribution of electric power for public consumption are the direct\n\nresponsibility of the Government.\n GOJ has taken the decision to privatize and liberalize the\n\nelectricity sector over the long-term and as a first step, all new generating\n\ncapacity is being undertaken by the private sector ( inclusive of independent\n\nself generators) through Independent Power Producers ( IPP).\n This is a major policy initiative which is aimed at moving the system\n\nof generation, transmission and distribution into largely private sector\n\nownership and management. \n\n  A major policy initiative therefore in the power sector will be\n\nto ensure that an appropriate regulatory framework under the auspices of the\n\nOffice of Utilities Regulation ( OUR) is put in place to: \n\n  a) facilitate the timely provision of new power generating\n\ncapacity and the associated transmission works; \n\n  b) establish an environment capable of attracting private\n\ninvestments in the power sector and capable of supporting long term\n\nfinancing for the private sector; and \n\n \n\n  d) ensure the safety of the consumers, the protection and\n\npreservation of the environment in respect of utility services; \n\n  e) generally support Jamaica\'s power sector privatization\n\nprogramme. \n\n  The energy policy for the power / electricity sector will ensure\n\nthat: \n\n \n\n  b) the electricity rate setting mechanism reflects the true cost\n\nof power; \n\n  c) all new power generation projects are undertaken by the\n\nprivate sector and the generation of electricity is done in an organized and\n\nstructured way; \n\n  d) the use of co-generation to meet some portion of electricity\n\nsupply will continue to be pursued and principles under which the electricity\n\ncompany purchases electricity from co-generators clearly established; \n\n  e) the agency responsible for generation capacity planning will\n\nprepare a periodic Least Cost Expansion Plan ( LCEP) for review, approval and\n\npublication by the competent authority; \n\n  f) the widespread publication of the indicative LCEP provides\n\nguidance to potential private sector investors in the development of\n\nproposals for new plants; \n\n  g) the Rural Electrification Programme is continued in order to\n\nmaintain the extension of electricity to rural areas with a view to fostering\n\neconomic development and improving the quality of life in rural communities.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Currently, Jamaica imports petroleum and\n\npetroleum products on favourable terms from Venezuela and Mexico under the\n\nSan José Accord.\n As long as these contractual arrangements remain favourable from a\n\nnational interest point of view, they will be continued.\n Even with privatization, it is envisaged that the country will\n\ncontinue to enjoy the benefits of crude oil supplies under the existing\n\ncontractual arrangements in the same way that Jamaica enjoyed these prior to\n\nacquisition of the refinery in 1982.\n The market has been deregulated for the importation of all petroleum\n\nproducts since 1993. \n\n  Government recognizes that the processing of\n\ncrude is a desirable option and as such, will encourage refinery operation in\n\nthe country.\n\n\n  a) encourage the local refining of petroleum through the granting\n\nof an appropriate differential between tariffs on refinery feedstock and the\n\nimportation of fully refined petroleum products; \n\n  b) encourage private sector participation in the refinery and\n\nother government-owned petroleum/energy entities; \n\n  c) review and optimize specifications for all petroleum products\n\nto meet modern economic and environmental requirements; \n\n  d) require importers and marketers of petroleum to supply timely\n\nand relevant information regarding imports, sales, etc.\n The provision of this information will be necessary for proper energy\n\nplanning; \n\n  e) review and establish the policy for the pricing of petroleum\n\nproducts in order to achieve the objective of minimizing subsidies and\n\npromoting the policy of energy conservation; \n\n  f) ensure a predetermined level of inventory that will guarantee\n\nthat the nation\'s petroleum supplies are maintained at the required levels;\n\n\n\n  g) seek to maintain the protection of the environment and the\n\npreservation/encouragement of natural and cultivated forests.\n Although for example, Government will cause the overall removal of\n\nsubsidy on domestic kerosene, it will remain committed to same direct subsidy\n\nto assist those poor households that can be identified as totally dependent\n\non that petroleum product for cooking and lighting. \n\n \n\n\n\n  The Government will continue to foster,\n\nfacilitate and encourage the development of all new and renewable energy\n\nsources where feasible, but especially in the areas of: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Since energy conservation and improved energy\n\nefficiency appear to provide the greatest scope for reducing Jamaica\'s\n\nrequirements of imported energy, this aspect of the Energy Policy cannot be\n\nover-emphasized.\n\n\n  a) the Government will support the dissemination of information\n\nregarding energy conservation measures; \n\n  b) all electricity generating entities will be encouraged to\n\ncontinue the implementation of the loss reduction programmes; \n\n  c) Demand Side Management ( DSM) programmes will be developed for\n\nthe power sector.\n The objectives of these programmes will be clearly specified and the\n\ninstitutional arrangements are to be set out in DSM policy guidelines; \n\n  d) Government will demonstrably support DSM programmes by\n\nreducing or eliminating duties applicable to all energy efficient and energy\n\nconservation devices and equipment; \n\n  e) Government will ensure coordination between the transport\n\nsector and energy planning; \n\n  f) the appliance testing and labelling programme presently being\n\ncarried out at the Jamaica Bureau of Standards ( JBS) will be extended to all\n\nappliances that use electric energy; \n\n<P>  g) the Energy Efficiency Building Code ( EEBC) will be\n\npromulgated and enforced; and \n\n  h) the Government will make it a legal requirement for industrial\n\nboilers to be inspected annually. \n\n \n\n  The protection of the environment is a primary\n\nobjective of this Energy Policy and as such, the environmental\n\nguidelines of the Natural Resources Conservation Authority ( NRCA) relating\n\nto the energy sector will be strictly enforced. \n\n \n\n  a. The Ministry with responsibility for energy\n\nwill have overall responsibility for the implementation of the policy; \n\n  b. The recently established Office of Utilities Regulation ( OUR)\n\nwill have oversight responsibility for the regulatory framework for the\n\nrelevant energy sector entities.\n This office will protect the interest of both the consumer and the\n\ninvestor in the provision and utilization of public utility services; \n\n  c. The Ministry will foster the establishment of a central energy\n\nconservation and renewable unit which will act as a facilitator for all new\n\nand renewable energy projects.\n This unit will provide a central point for inputs from the public and\n\nthe scientific community with regard to technological developments etc.\n\n\n \n\n  As an incentive to the energy sector, the\n\nfollowing will be done: \n\n  - economic pricing will guide the pricing regime for all energy\n\nsupplies; \n\n  - the tax to be applied on energy conservation equipment,\n\nmaterials and supplies will be such that it will ensure that the items\n\ninvolved are available to the public and that consumers will be encouraged to\n\ninvest in the most efficient end-use device or technology; \n\n  - the use of solar panels and tubes for water heating, and solar\n\ncells designed to produce electricity will be encouraged by maintaining\n\na concessionary tax structure on these items; \n\n  - electric utilities will be provided with a mechanism to\n\nrecover the expenditure made for conservation programmes through the tariff\n\nstructure; \n\n  - energy conservation represents a national saving to the economy\n\nand as demonstrated through the Demand Side Management programme.\n It can also represent significant savings to industries.\n Government will encourage investors in energy conservation and DSM\n\nto take advantage of the accelerated depreciation of capital equipment\n\nschemes that now prevail; \n\n  - currently the electric utility allows up to 15% external\n\nbenefit for the development of renewable projects.\n That is, the utility is prepared to pay up to 15% more for\n\nelectricity generated by renewable sources compared to the average price paid\n\nfor fossil fuel generated electricity.\n This is to ensure that renewable sources of energy become a part of\n\nthe electricity generation mix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  FOR THE majority of Jamaican men, fashion is mere froth and\n\nfluff, the sole prerogative of women. \n\n  The cognoscenti however, are aware that fashion is big business,\n\nthat  " fashion"  is the art-form, the high-profile, ro <l>\n\nmantic aspect of a dynamic and sophisticated industry whose parameters\n\nextend to textiles and the manufacture of every item of apparel worn by man,\n\nwoman and child. \n\n  The apparel industry was for many years seen only as sweatshop\n\noperations with hordes of poor immigrant and Third World women huddled over\n\nmachines, working under subhuman conditions. \n\n  Some of these kinds of operations still of course exist,\n\nand the industry remains largely labour intensive.\n But the direction now is away from a low capital to labour ratio, as\n\n21st century technology is being widely introduced. \n\n  Today, modern sewing machines are so high-powered they can\n\nproduce up to 6,000 stitches per minute.\n Embroidery machines can produce a design on many different\n\npieces of cloth at the same time \x13 without a machine operator.\n In fact, a completely automated sewing assembly line is\n\nbeing developed in Japan; the only thing humans will do is supervise.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '39c9ad78-cca4-4d26-86da-820d911a1754', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.418256+00:00', 'english_score': 0.926210343837738, 'non_english_score': 0.07378965616226196}
{'text': "lthough the motorcar is today an essential\n\nmode of transport in Jamaica, it is impossible to ascertain the exact date on\n\nwhich the first one arrived in the island.\n According to an Editorial published in the Daily Gleaner of January\n\n29, 1906,  \n\n   the first motor car that reached our shores was owned by Mr L\n\nD. Baker, Junior, at Port Antonio, in 1900.\n Mr. E Nuttall, the well known Kingston solicitor followed Mr. Baker\n\nand in the Winter of 1903 imported a steam car locomobile.\n cars, Dr.\n\nHenderson was the first in the Spring of 1904 with a Duryea soon followed by\n\nMr. Griffiths of Black River with a fourteen horse power Orleans\n\ncar.\n\n  By 1906 there were about a dozen cars in the island and they must\n\nreally have been novelties amongst the traditional  'horse and\n\nbuggies'  then in use for everyday transport. \n\n  Early motoring was regarded as a sport, not anything to be taken\n\nseriously.\n Opinion was divided as to whether it would amount to anything, or\n\nremain just a fad.\n Given the trials faced by the early Jamaican motorist, it is indeed\n\na wonder that the motorcar became a popular and essential means of transport.\n\n\n\n  To help foster this new phenomenon, the Jamaica Motor Union had\n\nbeen formed in 1905 to encourage safe automobilism, improve road conditions,\n\nfight against laws which would restrict the growth of automobilism, encourage\n\nsafe driving and provide information to the motoring public.\n The President was Dr G.C. Henderson and the Secretary was Mr E.\n\nNuttall. \n\n  Newspapers of the day served to publish both the views of early\n\n 'automobilists',  ( as they called themselves) as well as of\n\nthose not so inclined to this new mode of transport.\n Editorials usually sought to highlight both points of view but\n\nseemed to accept that cars had arrived to stay.\n The activities of the Legislative Council were also reported in the\n\npapers, so it is possible to get an idea of the then Government's viewpoint\n\non this new and evolving phenomenon.\n By 1908, road guides of the island, complete with maps and motoring\n\ntips, were being published for both tourists and locals alike.\n From all these sources, it is possible to gain a sense of early\n\nmotoring in Jamaica as well as the difficulties and problems faced by the\n\nmotorists. \n\n \n\n \n\n  There were conflicts between the new automobilists and those who\n\ntravelled by more established forms of road transport from the beginning.\n An example of this is contained in a letter, signed with a\n\nnom-de-plume of  'Caution'  which appeared in the  Gleaner\n\n on February 14, 1905.\n It reported an account of an encounter between a buggy and motorcar\n\non a country road: \n\n \n\n\n  Sir, On one of our country roads recently a serious accident\n\nmight have occurred, because of the careless driving of a motor car, the\n\ndriver of which without sound of horn or whistle, rushed round a corner and\n\nfrightened the horses attached to a buggy which was being driven by a lady.\n Fortunately the only injury was to the pole of the buggy, but there\n\nmight have been loss of life or limb.\n Of course, any expenditure incurred for repairs may be recovered\n\nfrom the transgressor.\n\n  We are pleased to welcome cordially all visitors and tourists,\n\nbut we do expect that they will give all necessary attention to the rights of\n\nthe road.\n\n  'Caution's'\n\n letter appeared, written by Mr H.W. Griffiths of Hodges, Black\n\nRiver, in which he claimed to be the driver of the car involved in the\n\nincident.\n\n\n \n On my way from St. Elizabeth to Trelawny, by way of Ramble,\n\nat the latter place there are many turnings.\n Before reaching each one my horn was loudly sounded.\n No doubt the rattle of the buggy must have prevented the driver from\n\neither hearing the horn or the noise of the engines working.\n On rounding one of these turnings but not fast ( otherwise I should\n\nnot have been able to pull up in time) as the turning happened to be a sharp\n\none, I came across the buggy mentioned after I was well round the corner, and\n\non my proper side, as the car pulled up in the left-hand watercourse; the\n\nbuggy was still proceeding not actually on the wrong side of the road, but a\n\nlittle more than in the middle, so much so that I could not have passed and\n\npulled up fully thirty- five feet from where I first stopped; the driver of\n\nthe buggy moved then on to her left side and I commenced to proceed, but when\n\nI got about twenty feet from the buggy, the pony on the off-side became\n\nfractious.\n I at once stopped the car, and also the engines entirely, and waited\n\nfor the buggy to pass.\n As the ponies were being driven forward again, the off-side one\n\nsuddenly backed, but only for a yard or so, as the other pony was pulling\n\nforward; this sudden jerk bent the table of the buggy...\n\n  As a result of such confrontations, an anti-motorcar lobby came\n\ninto being in Jamaica and tried to fight the oncoming change, sometimes going\n\nto extremes to present their point of view.\n This was reflected in a letter written in 1906 by a visitor to the\n\nisland, suggesting that Jamaica be kept a motorcar-free zone or that the tax\n\non    gasoline   and cars be made so high as\n\nto prohibit their use here: \n\n \n The great majority of people from the U.S.A: who come to\n\nJamaica are quiet, sensible people who bring tired nerves and while\n\nrecuperating in your invigorating climate want to enjoy its beautiful scenery\n\nwithout taking their lives in their hands every mile while they are doing so.\n Five of every such visitors would be driven away for every one\n\nautomobilist who would come if automobiles were common in Jamaica.\n\n\n  to Motoring\n\n  \n\n  From the early motorist's point of view, everything seemed to\n\nconspire against the success of motoring in Jamaica.\n 'gas tax'\n\n , a lack of spare parts and trained mechanics, and bad roads in many\n\nareas.\n The tax on petroleum products was a particularly strong issue raised\n\nby motorists.\n of January 29, 1906, outlined\n\nthe issue: \n\n \n The one great obstacle in the development of motoring in\n\nJamaica is the enormous import duty to which all the products of petroleum\n\nare liable.\n used in explosion motors\n\n(  author's note: internal combustion engines) costs anything from\n\nsixpence to eightpence per gallon in addition to which there is a duty of\n\nsevenpence halfpenny which just doubles the cost.\n When it is further remembered that an owner is called upon to pay a\n\nlicense of 5 shillings for driving and 10 shillings for registration in\n\naddition to the ordinary wheel tax it will be seen that motoring is somewhat\n\nof an expensive luxury.\n\n  At the heart of the matter was the Government's refusal to lower\n\nthe duty on    gasoline   as it was once\n\nthought that it would be more popular than kerosene as fuel for lamps in the\n\nhome.\n Although the Government knew this not to be so and, in fact, derived\n\nonly about &pound; 200 annually from this tax, they still refused to lower it\n\nat that time.  \n\n  A lack of motorcar supplies and a regular supply of gasoline\n\nalso plagued early motorists.\n\n\nGleaner  on October 21, 1905: \n\n \n As there are altogether less than a dozen motor vehicles,\n\nincluding cars, tricars and motor cycles, in Jamaica, there is not sufficient\n\ndemand for regular establishments for the supply of petrol, lubricants and\n\nparts.\n A small amount of gasoline is imported by some hardware dealers and\n\nothers, but car owners, as a rule, import their own petrol in iron drums of\n\nten to 100 American gallons ( equal eight to eighty English), and they are\n\nalways ready to assist one another, or a brother motorist visiting the\n\nisland, in case of need.\n As passenger steamers by insurance regulations are forbidden to\n\ncarry petrol, it can only come down once a month in cargo boats and the cost\n\nwith freight, duty etc., works out at about 2s 6d to ls 9d per English\n\ngallon.\n\n \n\n  One of the earliest references to road etiquette was found in a\n\nletter by Mr Griffiths in the  Gleaner  of February 22, 1905.\n In it he offered advice to other motorists and drivers of buggies,\n\nshould they find themselves in a position of conflict: \n\n \n Should any driver meet a motor car, who is handling a\n\nfractious animal, all he has to do is put up his hand of warning: the\n\nmotorist is not to know an animal is fractious unless he is warned, and then\n\nhe must stop his car, and I feel sure that certain motorists would render all\n\npossible assistance should it be required.\n\n  In an attempt to draw attention to the problem motorists faced\n\nin sharing the road with other users, Dr George Henderson, as President of\n\nthe Jamaica Motor Union, wrote yet another letter to the  Daily Gleaner\n\n on March 8, 1906.\n 'automobilists'\n\n that the Legislature do something about other road users more\n\ndelinquent than motorists were: \n\n \n there always have been and will always\n\nbe, and the automobilist is not the only offender in that class.\n Pedestrians, riders, cart and buggy drivers as well who insist upon\n\nmonopolising more than their due share of the road and obstructing,\n\nendangering by neglecting to lead or exercise proper control of their\n\nanimals, and refusing or neglecting to make way for traffic meeting or\n\novertaking them, all form species of that genius, and equally show an entire\n\ndisregard of the  'rule of the road'.\n\n  Pioneers have always to undergo an extra amount of trouble and\n\nencounter opposition, and while I do not complain unduly of the restrictions\n\nthe Legislature has seen fit to place upon motorists in return for granting\n\nthem the privilege to use the roads, I am in hopes that in the future a sense\n\nof equity may yet induce it to turn the attention of its officers to the\n\npedestrian or donkey drivers who walk four or six abreast in the main roads,\n\ndriving their animals in front of them, instead of leading, the small\n\nchildren often seen in charge(!) of carts drawn by mules or horses which they\n\nare entirely unable to control, the deaf or sleeping driver whose trap\n\nmeanders along the centre of the roadway who requires almost a giant cracker\n\nto rouse him to consciousness...\n\n  Sharing the road with other forms of vehicular traffic meant\n\nthat the motorcar needed to have some special means of identification to warn\n\nthe pedestrian of the type of machine which was in close proximity.\n photograph\n\n  1905, Section 10, specified that,  'The person\n\nin charge of a motor car shall carry attached thereto a horn or other\n\ninstrument capable of giving audible and sufficient warning of the approach\n\nor position of the motor car.' \n However, by 1908 every form of wheeled traffic was sporting a horn.\n The potential for danger arising from this was obvious as Dr\n\nHenderson pointed out in a letter of March 26, 1908: \n\n \n If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, motorists\n\nshould be proud of the way in which their signal has  'caught\n\non' and been appropriated by users of other vehicles.\n\n  There is another side to the question: the safety of the public.\n Normal road users regulate their pace and movements relative to\n\nvehicles overtaking them by the sound of signals heard by them, and if the\n\nsame signal is used by carriages at 6-8 miles per hour, cycles at 8-12 and\n\nmotors at 16-20, confusion is likely to occur, and an error of judgement on\n\ntheir part, or on that of the motorist, for whose use, under penalty, the\n\nhorn was originally prescribed, may easily result in serious or fatal\n\naccident.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd78287d4-158e-4e66-93ba-c2b116a626c6', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.419740+00:00', 'english_score': 0.976409912109375, 'non_english_score': 0.023590087890625}
{'text': 'THE CURRENT public discussions concerning the granting of a cable\n\ntelevision licence to one or other of the existing, or a new television\n\nstation, in the context of the Government\'s economic liberalisation policies,\n\nappears so far to have a limited perspective on this important question. \n\n  There are relevant telecommunication technologies and policy\n\nissues emerging internationally , which should inform such a debate.\n A missing element which should be central to these considerations is\n\nthe role of the Jamaica Telephone Company ( JTC) and TOJ in the future of the\n\nnational telecommunication system. \n\n  Telecommunication systems in North America and Europe have evolved\n\nfrom telephony in the 1870s, to radio, to broadcast TV, then to cable-TV or\n\nCATV and finally to data communications to facilitate the computer\n\nrevolution.\n The small copper wires which run from the local exchange to the\n\ncustomer\'s house or business to provide telephone services were not suitable\n\nfor TV and high volume computer data because the transmission channel was too\n\nsmall. \n\n  To make the benefits of the newly developed communication and\n\ncomputer technologies widely available, it was necessary to establish new\n\nfacilities, such as packet-switching data networks by telephone companies,\n\nand an entirely new network of coaxial cable for TV distribution by CATV\n\ncompanies which were, for the most part, different from those doing\n\nbroadcast-TV, such as JBC TV. \n\n  Since the late 1970s, a branch of the United Nations \x13 the\n\nInternational Telecommunications Union, working through the International\n\nConsultative Committee for Telephone and Telegraph, one of its arms \x13 in\n\ncooperation with the International Standards Organisation and all the major\n\ntelecommunications and computer companies worldwide, has been working on\n\nstandards for the development and implementation of a more rational and\n\nefficient system for the delivery of all the services above, both at their\n\nbasic and enhanced quality levels, such as plain telephone service,\n\nelectronic yellow pages, colour tax, picturephone, high definition\n\ntelevision, etc. \n\n  The technological bases for this effort are the established world\n\ncapacities for the high volume production of very large-scale integrated\n\nelectronic circuits, wide transmission channels through optical fibre cables,\n\nand dramatic price reductions for computing and telephone exchange equipment.\n\n\n\n \n\n  One of the first results of this continuing collaboration is the\n\npromulgation of standards for two new categories of telephone service called\n\nnarrowband and broadband Integrated Services Digital Networks.\n The rates and methods of implementation by companies and governments\n\nwill depend on such considerations as maximizing the use of the existing\n\ncostly copper cable system; ensuring that the interests of subscribers are\n\nprotected both in monopoly and competitive conditions; optimising the use of\n\nscarce foreign exchange; balancing of private versus national interests, and\n\nothers. \n\n  Narrowband ISDN can be transmitted on the existing copper outside\n\nplant but CATV cannot, so there is need for a new wide-channel transmission\n\ninfrastructure for CATV specifically, and broadband ISDN generally. \n\n  Will it be coaxial cable or optical fibres in the subscriber\n\naccess network?\n CATV companies abroad are finding it cost-effective to use fibre up\n\nto the headend distribution point to which many customers are connected, and,\n\nsimilarly telephone companies use    fibre   for\n\ntrunk links between exchanges. \n\n  From the viewpoint of telephone companies, fibre of the local\n\nloop, through existing ducts or as an overlay, has to justify itself \x13 in\n\nterms of capital, operational and maintenance costs \x13 against the expansion\n\nof the in-place copper-using concentrators, multiplexors and pair-gain\n\ndevices, on a plain telephone service revenue basis \x13 the overwhelmingly\n\ndominant revenue source. \n\n  Because the local loop does not generally extend beyond five\n\nmiles ( perhaps considerably less in Jamaica) and the economies of fibre are\n\nobtained over much longer distances, fibre-to-the-home has proved to be three\n\ntimes as costly as copper; and fibre-to-the-terminal distributor supplying\n\nmany subscribers, one and one-fifth as costly. \n\n  These are data reported from field trials conducted since 1986 in\n\nEurope and North America for  \'active\'  local loop fibre\n\nsystems involving components which convert between the light and electrical\n\nelements not only at the exchange and customer premises, but also in between.\n \'passive\'\n\n loop-fibre technologies which require conversions only at the loop\n\nextremities and operate with considerably reduced costs compared to active\n\nsystems. \n\n \n\n  - Whether a new coax network is more economical in the long run\n\non a CATV revenue base, with the additional advantage of providing\n\ncompetition in the telecommunication marketplace, versus fibre on a CATV,\n\nvoice and data revenue base; should the telephone company be allowed to\n\nprovide CATV service in addition to what it presently does; or should it be a\n\ncommon carrier for whomever wants to lease its transmission facilities \x13\n\nfibre or coax?\n Should JTC be encouraged to invest in local access fibre, despite the\n\nrelatively high cost, but extend the service only to business customers whose\n\nservice demand will allow for break-even operation, at a minimum? \n\n  The explosion in the range of telecommunication service over the\n\nlast two decades, and the promise of even more in the immediate future, has\n\nawoken many businesses and countries to the competitive advantages which can\n\naccrue from the creative exploitation of this resource.\n Surely, Jamaica ought to strive to be ready for the international\n\ncompetition as we approach the 21st century. \n\n  - Courtney Jackson is a former executive engineering analyst\n\nwith the Jamaica Telephone Company.\n He is currently a PhD. student in industrial and systems engineering\n\nat the University of Florida, U.S.A.   \n\n\n\n \n\n  ONE of our local cable television subscribers complained\n\nabout the quality of the picture she has been receiving from her local cable\n\nsystem ( or company).\n This is one of the shortcomings of the local cable systems, and the\n\noperators cannot be blamed for this, I am not aware of a stated cable\n\nstandard for Jamaica. \n\n \n\nedgeable cable operator, who was aware of the problem.\n\n\nciation, are dealing with such transmission problems, using North American\n\ntechniques and standard.\n One gets the impression that because there\'s no clear-cut policy\n\nor standard for cable television in Jamaica, the local pioneers will have to\n\nrely heavily on the technology developed primarily by the North American\n\ncable industry.\n In comparison to the present state of the North American cable\n\nindustry, we are still in Noah\'s Ark. \n\n  Jamaica\'s current state of communications technology is no doubt\n\nin infancy.\n\n\n" clean"  radio link from say Montego Bay, for broadcast from a\n\nKingston station.\n " talk-back"\n\n between the studio and the outside broadcast crews.\n I suppose the lack of money and vision could be blamed for where we\n\nare in communications technology. \n\n  " It\n\nhas long been recognized that advanced communication techniques can\n\nprovide enormous military, political and economic advantages.\n Information is power, and communication techniques have had\n\nan important influence on the distribution of power within societies, as well\n\nas the rise and fall of empires, as the studies of Canadian Scholar Harold\n\nInnis have shown"  . \n\n  At this stage of our development, we could easily relate to\n\nthe following:  " Pioneering in communications technology has been a\n\nmixed blessing for Canada.\n The introduction of cable television and direct broadcast satellite\n\nfacilities has dramatically expanded the choice of US television\n\nprogrammes available to Canadians, but it also has had detrimental financial\n\neffects on Canadian television and film production and has reduced op <l>\n\nportunities for Canadian artistic and cultural expression through its own\n\nmass media.\n Several Govvernmental commissions have been created in an\n\nattempt to suggest government policies that will overcome these problems".\n\n \n\n  It is good to see that the JBC, which operates radio and the\n\nnation\'s first TV station, made a profit for the first time in its 30-year\n\nhistory... 2 million dollars.\n In the face of new competition from CVM-TV ( sorry I couldn\'t attend\n\ntheir recent survey luncheon as the invitation did not reach me on time)\n\nand the cable operators, it will be interesting to see how they fare in the\n\nfuture. \n\n  CVM is also going to have a big impact of the revenue of the\n\nJBC-TV station, as it is claiming to be pulling in more viewers in the areas\n\nthey cover.\n Cable viewers said to be 3.5 per cent of the market and I know\n\nthat, that figure is growing. \n\n  Whether we like it, it would appear that cable television is here\n\nto stay.\n "\n\nCultural Penetration"  by the American movie and television\n\nindustry ( it was o.k. at the time to soak in as much as you could, Cuban and\n\nSoviet propaganda), without seriously taking note of the fact that as\n\nfar as communication was concerned, the world was fast becoming a Global\n\nVillage.\n Satellite communication is responsible for that.\n Cable television and over-the-air TV in Jamaica are making sure that\n\npenetration reaches a peak level.\n\n\n  From my experience, one thing I am sure about is that many of the\n\ncable operators have a vision and are genuinely interested in modern technolo\n\n<l> gy.\n\n\n \n\n  The word is that talks to restructure Turner Broadcasting\n\nSystem have been discontinued and will resume later in the year.\n Turner Broadcasting System Incorporated, and its two major\n\nshareholders, Time Warner Incorporated and Tele-Communications\n\nIncorporated, have been trying to divide up the US company and give Chairman\n\nTed Turner, more freedom in the media business. \n\n \n\nFederal Communications Commission ( FCC) blocks cable companies from owning\n\nmore programming, it could cancel any plans for selling off such Turner\n\nBroadcasting assets as Cable News Network ( CNN), TNT and the TBS\n\nentertainment networks. \n\n \n\n  The publication also named some new satellite channels.\n They are: The History Network, World African Network, The Military\n\nChannel, Food Network, Golf Channel, The Game Show Channel, The Game\n\nChannel, History TV Network and the Crime Channel. \n\n  The July issue of Satellite Orbit reports that dish owners cannot\n\nreceive Digital Cable Radio on F3, 9 and 12 and Digital Music Express on\n\nF3, 24 because decoders for the services are not available for home satellite\n\nTV systems.\n It said the services have plans to make the packages of digital audio\n\nchannels available in the future.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  THE Kingston Harbour is the major physio-geographical\n\nfactor that contributed to Kingston being the largest inhabited city in\n\nJamaica.\n It provided the principal port for commerce and trade and related\n\nindustrial and residential development.\n However, the seemingly inevitable by-product of civilization, wastes,\n\nhas gradually had a negative effect.  \n\n  Industrial and commercial development have produced a variety of\n\nwaste that have contaminated the soil, water and air.\n Solid waste from these developments have cluttered the gullies that\n\nsubsequently wash into the harbour.\n Poor agricultural practices have also caused contamination of the\n\nHarbour due to the gradual erosion of valuable top soil.\n The use of fertilizers and pesticides in an effort to improve\n\nproductivity has also had the undesirable effect of contamination of surface\n\nand groundwater flows to the Harbour. \n\n  Several recent studies have not yet resulted in the\n\nimplementation of programmes geared toward halting the pollution loads to the\n\nHarbour.\n While a number of proposals has been aired on various approaches of\n\nphysically cleaning the Harbour, the strategy will have to be one that\n\ntackles the problem at the source. \n\n  Two basic approaches to the problem of the eutrophication of the\n\nHarbour have been considered.\n By seawater exchange through pumping from outside the Harbour or by\n\naltering the Harbour configuration or alternatively, by dramatically reducing\n\npollution to the Harbour. \n\n  The strategy of waste reduction is a proven means of curtailing\n\nthe deterioration of environmental conditions and while it is not without\n\ncost and will have to be a long-term approach, it reduces the risk associated\n\nwith major civil works and inherently has economic benefits not directly\n\nlinked to Harbour rehabilitation.', 'subdomain':

{'text': 'THE oil pan has no mechanical function, but serves as the reser\n\n<l> voir for the engine oil. \n\n  As simple as this pan may seem, sharp stones and other debris can\n\neasily tear a hole in it large enough to cause the oil to leak out in a very\n\nshort time.\n The oil pan gasket, which is between the pan and the block can also\n\nleak, thus leading to major worries. \n\n \n\ndard transmission are: worn oil seals; defective gaskets; a loose drain plug;\n\ndamaged threads on drain plugs; a too high oil level; the incorrect fitting\n\nof an oil pan gasket; a cracked transmission case; a missing drain plug\n\ngasket; loose transmission bolts, and  defective transmission compo\n\n<l> nents, such as the front and rear bearings. \n\n  If a vehicle has been involved in a front-end collision, it is\n\nmore than likely that the oil pan will be damaged.\n This pan must then be removed, strightened and reinstalled.\n When replaced, there must be no spaces to allow the oil to seep past\n\nthe pan gasket. \n\n \n\n  There are times when gaskets are not aligned properly during\n\ninstallation.\n Oil running from an oil pan will usually find itself elsewhere before\n\ndripping onto the ground, giving absolutely no idea as to the location of the\n\nleak. \n\n  The proper method of tracing an oil leak is to first clean\n\nthe engine from top to bottom.\n After the engine is dry, place it on a ramp and run it for a while.\n\n\n \n\n  The oil pump does not usually break down mechanically, as it\n\nis gear-driven from the camshaft.\n But how do you detect a defective oil pump?\n When the oil light stays on after the engine is in motion or if the\n\noil pressure guage does not show the correct pressure.\n Remember, too, these are the signs the car gives when it is running\n\nout of oil. \n\n  Trouble with the oil pump can step in when a plugged oil-pump\n\nscreen, designed to keep debris out of the teeth of the pump, becomes\n\nclogged.\n Have your mechanic check the oil pump thoroughly if there is any\n\ndoubt of its efficiency. \n\n  If low oil pressure is detected it could also be a result of a\n\nworn camshaft or crankcase bearings, a sticking pressure-relief valve or\n\nbroken valve spring in the oil pump.\n It could also be the result of a cracked or loose pipe inside the oil\n\npan that feeds the lubricant to various engine components. \n\n \n\n  The flywheel is a large, round, heavy piece of metal that makes\n\nit possible for the engine to idle smoothly at low speeds.\n The flywheel is attached to the rear of the crankshaft.\n Its weight and shape helps to provide continuous movement of the\n\ncrankshaft.\n The flywheel helps in moving the pistons in the engine to the top of\n\nthe compression stroke without the use of the engine\'s power.\n The pistons are actually operated by the internal combustion of the\n\nengine with the help of the continuous movement of the flywheel and\n\ncrankshaft. \n\n  Without the inertia of the flywheel, it would be impossible to\n\nsmooth out the firing impulses as the fuel / air mixture is ignited in\n\neach cylinder.\n A ring gear is attached to it, fitted along its outer circumference.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\ngages the flywheel ring gear to rotate the crankshaft and start the engine\n\nwhen the ignition switch is operated.\n If the ignition-timing marks are not on the front crankshaft\n\npulley, they will be on the flywheel. \n\n  In a car with automatic transmission, the engine has no flyw\n\n<l> heel.\n Instead, a unit known as the driveplate is attached to the rear of\n\nthe crankshaft.\n The torque converter is attached to the driveplate, with their\n\ncombined weight acting as a  \'flywheel\'  .\n In an automatic vehicle, the ring gear is attached to the drive\n\nplate. \n\n  Vehicles with standard transmission have a clutch assembly\n\nwhich is bolted to the flywheel to transmit the engine\'s power to the\n\ntransmission. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  IT continues unabated \x13 the manufacturing of substandard concrete\n\nblocks by both established and backyard manufacturers alike.\n This practice could have disastrous effect on our building industry\n\nif tighter controls and more vigilance is not exercised in determining\n\nthe sort of materials that go into construction. \n\n  It is not uncommon to see newly-purchased concrete blocks\n\ndisintegrating without much force being applied to them.\n Sometimes just simply picking up a block causes it to fall apart.\n\n\n\n \n\ntance to persistent rains and occasional earth tremours. \n\n  To turn a blind eye to how we put materials together for\n\nconstruction purposes could make Jamaica a prime target for repeated\n\ndisasters during earthquake and rainy seasons. \n\n  Concrete blocks and ill-constructed slabs can develop irre\n\n<l> versible uneven shrinkages which would create very serious dimensional\n\nchanges in building structures.\n This problem of the uncertain quality of building materials is partly\n\neconomic and partly ignorance of the requirements for producing an\n\nacceptable unit. \n\n  The Jamaica Building Code allows minimum strength of a concrete\n\nblock to be 1000 pounds per square inch.\n A recent check has shown that despite the continued\n\nvigilance of the Jamaica Bureau of Standards, concrete blocks still fall\n\nwoefully short of the required standards. \n\n \n\n  The high cost of cement could cause even the established\n\nmanufacturers to use economical formulations.\n Fine aggregate can replace cement.\n The back-yard producer may not only cut back on cement but water\n\ncontent may lack consistency.\n Different moisture content in different units would create\n\ndifferential shrinkage.\n Another serious problem is that in trying to make a unit strong\n\nwithout proper laboratory facilities, too rich a mix could create progressive\n\nshrinking in the finished unit. \n\n  While corrugated steel plays an important part as support,\n\nstructure cracks in buildings must be avoided.\n For, apart from the unwholesome appearance they give the\n\nbuilding, cracks set up stresses in the most unlikely areas.\n\n\n  Certain some applications which can help reduce shrinkage of\n\nconcrete blocks and slabs so that cracking of walls built with these\n\nmaterials is eliminated. \n\n  Cement-bonded material show two kinds of dimensional change.\n First, a progressive shrinkage taking place at a gradually\n\nreducing rate and next, shrinkage and expansion, due respectively to drying\n\nand wetting.\n The progressive shrinkage is greater the richer the mix.\n It is much affected by curing conditions and if thorough\n\nmoist-curing takes place before the units are built, subsequent shrinkage\n\nwill be less.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Until quite recently, Fitzgerald jeans were manufactured\n\nexclusively for a North American clientele.\n But marketing problems there, have forced the company to go local.\n\n\n\n  Eugene Shepherd, 25 year old owner of the Fitzgerald label found\n\nthat he had to go in search of local markets as he simply could not find a\n\nway of effectively, getting his product to his overseas market.\n Jamaica has now become the main focus of his garment manufacturing\n\noperation  " Cool Creations".  \n\n  Kingston, Eugene\n\nis one of  " 11 brothers and sisters that I know of, I\'ve heard of\n\nabout twenty- odd more",  he said with a laugh.\n A past student of the Holy Family Primary and Meadowbrook High\n\nschools, Eugene told  The Business Herald  that while still a\n\nstudent in high school, his career interest was centred on  "\n\nwoodworking"  .\n Little did young Eugene guess that sewing and not woodworking, would\n\nbe his destiny. \n\n \n\nturing, that Eugene realised its potential as a good business opportunity.\n A fact which appealed greatly to the young school leaver he was\n\nthen.\n It was also an area, to which Eugene had been previously exposed, not\n\nonly through his brother, but  " my mother was a dress-maker".\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  Highlighting the events which led up to him owning his own\n\nbusiness, Eugene said  " my brother, Neville was in the business of\n\nmanufacturing khaki uniforms for students". \n It was in this way that Eugene found himself involved in the garment\n\nmanufacturing industry, having been employed to his brother\'s operation as\n\n " the pressman, I used to press the uniforms"  .\n\n\n  But for Neville the garment manufacturing business was not to be\n\na life time affair.\n , which signified the end of\n\nhis entrepreneurial pursuits.\n .\n However what appeared to be the end of the road as far as Jamaica was\n\nconcerned for Neville, was only the beginning for Eugene. \n\n  Telling of his other responsibilities in his brother\'s\n\nbusiness he said,  " I used to take the uniforms my brother made to\n\nthe market"  it was in this way that Eugene was exposed to the\n\nlucrativeness of the business.\n This he said was largely responsible for his decision to take up\n\nwhere his brother left off.\n He was 18 at the time.\n " When my brother left he left his machines and some pants"\n\n these were to be Eugene\'s tickets into the world of business. \n\n  and with the\n\naid of his older sister Janet  " mek it back"  .\n This was how he learned to sew, though he proudly stated he was\n\nmostly self taught in this area. \n\n  , which his\n\nbrother had left behind, that he was able to get funding to buy more\n\nmaterial to continue the business.\n Continuing, Eugene said his approach to a local small business\n\nlending agency, had proved futile as they demanded collateral.\n " I was just leaving school, whey me did fi get collateral?"\n\n \n\n \n\n  But Eugene persevered.\n Aided in his manufacturing mission by his sister Janet, Eugene named\n\nhis business Cool Creations.\n Producing khaki school uniforms remained Eugene\'s angle until\n\n " a little brother"  living in his neighbourhood, came up\n\nwith the idea of designing and making jeans of different hues and fancy\n\ndesigns.\n Eugene was sold on the idea.\n And combining his efforts with those of the young man, jeans\n\nmanufacturing became a part of Cool  agenda. \n\n  " The guy didn\'t have any machines, he just had the idea\n\nand the know how",  Eugene informed  The Business Herald\n\n , so it was up to Eugene to provide the working equipment, while\n\n " the guy"  provided the expertise.\n However the partnership went belly up after three months, as a\n\nresult of a disagree <lment on work ethics between  the \ntwo y oung men. \n\n  Disagreement notwithstanding, Eugene remained in the business of\n\njeans manufacturing.\n In April of this year he actually went into the jeans manufacturing\n\nbusiness for himself.\n \'jeans expert\'\n\n , he had not been left high and dry.\n " While the guy was working here, I watched what he did and\n\nlearned how to make the jeans he produced".  \n\n  Since the start of business, for the Fitzgerald jeans label,\n\nwhich is the name Eugene gave his product \x13 it has been himself, his sister\n\nand a friend John, who have been the force behind production.\n Targeting the North American market, Eugene explained that this was\n\na holdover from the days when he worked with his friend.\n " When he just came up with the idea for the jeans, he made\n\none for my brother who wore it when he went away to the States". \n loved it and the idea to market the\n\njeans abroad, was born. \n\n  " When we know somebody going up, we would make some and\n\nsend up with them". \n " have a store abroad"\n\n .\n This became the main and only market for Fitzgerald\'s jeans.\n But the irregularity of this type of export method, which\n\ndepended heavily  " on when somebody going up"  - proved too\n\ninconsistent a sales technique.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'This second issue of Superscan is quite an exciting one.\n There has been a lot taking place since the first issue came out and\n\nthe progress on the campus computerization projects has been excellent.\n\n \n\n  The most exciting development is the fiber-optic network.\n It is now functional and connects major areas of computing activity on\n\nthe campus together.\n One of the most significant things about the installation and\n\ncommissioning of this very high speed network is that it was done exclusively\n\nby UWI personnel.\n We are very familiar with the common feeling that only overseas\n\n " experts"  can set up  " high-tech"  systems\n\nin Jamaica.\n Well, UWI has proved that not only are we an institution of higher\n\ntheoretical learning, we are also capable of putting that learning into\n\npractice very successfully.\n "\n\nhome-grown"  and are on par with anything the  " first world"\n\n can offer. \n\n  The next step is to develop the practical skills

the\n\nCONVEX supercomputer.\n Igor is our first researcher to use the CONVEX for his work and\n\nhas already written and submitted 3 papers from the results.\n Three more are expected before the year is finished.\n We look forward to welcoming more researchers from around the\n\nworld to make use of our computing facilities. \n\n  Finally, we hope to have a correspondence section.\n Please feel free to write with comments, questions or\n\nsuggestions to Keith Manison, SuperScan, Principals Office.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  In this issue of SuperScan we introduce Jeremy Whyte, a\n\ngraduate of UWI, now working with the Supercomputer and Network project on\n\ncampus as Systems Engineer.  \n\n  Born in Basseterre, St Kitts on May 7, 1963 Jeremy moved with his\n\nfamily to Jamaica in August of 1970.\n His schooling was accomplished at Glenmuir Prep in May Pen and\n\nthen Clarendon College up to 4th Form.\n He completed high school in Kingston at Excelsior and then came\n\nto UWI as an undergraduate student in 1981. \n\n  Jeremy got his BSc. in Physics, Electronics and Computer Science\n\nin 1985 and has been pursuing a Masters degree in Microcomputer based\n\nAdaptive Control Systems.\n Most of the work is complete and he is finalizing his thesis.\n of\n\nthe   MPhil program is that it forces you to learn very fast.\n " You may know nothing about a subject that you need\n\nto know at the beginning of a week.\n\n\npert, at least comfortable with it.\n How to learn fast from scratch is one of the most valuable things the\n\nMPhil program can teach you."  \n\n  Enticed to the supercomputer project in October 1992 Jeremy has\n\nhad to put this skill into practice as he has worked to commission the Convex\n\nand install of the fiber optic campus backbone.\n Often he has been working with the manuals in one hand and\n\nscrewdriver in the other.\n he\n\nsays  " there just aren\'t any other supercomputer installations\n\nin Jamaica, so you have to learn as you go."  \n\n  Jeremy has!\n Sent to the Convex training center in October 1992 for a five\n\nweek course he has been able to keep set up the Convex and network to provide\n\nthe services needed across the campus and keep it working for the users. \n\n  In his spare time ( when we let him have any) Jeremy changes pace\n\nby growing orchids and crewing on sailing boats.\n Chairman of the Jamaica Orchid Society\'s Show Committee, Jeremy\n\nis responsible for the organization of the annual spring orchid show, which\n\nis attended by many international participants.\n several ribbons for his own\n\nplants, but hasn\'t produced his own cross yet. \n\n  During the summer months Jeremy crews as mastman or foredeck crew\n\non a 39ft racing yacht and has competed in the Port Royal to Cayman races,\n\ncoming in 2nd and 3rd.\n Rumor has it that he is using the supercomputer to genetically\n\nengineer a rare and beautiful orchid ( Catalaya Convex Jerermais?) and design\n\na super-fast racing hull.\n Who knows, perhaps Jamaica will compete in the America\'s Cup sometime\n\nin the future.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  The Convex SuperComputer was purchased for UWI in\n\norder to enhance operations in three areas.\n These are Academic Research, Administration and to generate revenue\n\nfor the campus.\n In this Ker <l  <nal  we \nare going to look at the Academ ic Research\n\nthat is now taking place on the Convex.  \n\n  In January of this year Igor Shamovsky joined Dr. von Szentpaly\'s\n\ngroup at the UWI Chemistry department as a postdoctoral research fellow.\n From the Laboratory of Quantum Chemistry at the institute of Chemical\n\nPhysics, Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, Igor came to Jamaica to\n\ncontinue research in computer molecular simulations of large molecules.\n One of the reason he came was the availability of Supercomputer time,\n\nan essential requirement for his work. \n\n  Igor worked on a small Convex C210 at the Russian Academy of\n\nSciences, but quickly fell in love with UWI\'s much bigger and faster C3440.\n Being the first researcher to use the machine has some advantages,\n\nthe main one being is that Igor has almost exclusive use of the processing\n\nresources of the Convex, which is nice as his are the most complex jobs\n\nrunning on the machine. \n\n  But what exactly is the research going on, what are the practical\n\nbenefits, and why does it need a supercomputer to do it? \n\n \n\n  " A theoretical study on molecular systems is a very\n\npowerful tool of scientific research, which gives unequivocal information\n\nabout structural and energetic aspects of particular chemical phenomena.\n Nowadays, the preciseness of theoretical estimations is mainly\n\nlimited by available computational resources, and the problems of key\n\ninterest in the field of applied chemistry and industry can only be solved by\n\nthe use of the most powerful modern supercomputers."  \n\n  Igor is using Dr. Szentpaly\'s Valence State\'s Interaction (\n\nVSI) model to develop large and potentially extremely important molecules.\n In particular he is working on Crown Ethers, Clathrates and DNA\n\nmolecules. \n\n \n\n \n\n  Crown Ethers are an extremely important class of organic\n\nsubstance which are able to selectively catch polar molecules based on their\n\nsize rather than their chemical composition.\n\n\ncomplex, due in part to the ring structure of the crown ether molecule. \n\n  What is the practical application of the crown ethers?\n Well, imagine a filter that can be tuned to extract specific\n\ncontaminants or poisons from water.\n Imagine a filter that can selectively transmit specific metal ions\n\nthrough a biological membrane.\n The industrial potential for such processes is enormous.\n Mineral recovery, super pure water, contaminant free pharmaceuticals,\n\nthe list is endless.\n So much importance has been placed on crown ethers that a Nobel\n\nprize was awarded for the first synthesis of one. \n\n  However, as Dr. Szentpaly cautions, the syntheses known so far\n\nare extremely costly, a fact prohibiting large scale use of crown ethers at\n\nthe moment.\n The transition from a laboratory scale to an industrial process is a\n\nlong and difficult process in itself. \n\n  Dr\n\nSzentpaly adds,  " but quantum theoretical methods have been very\n\nsuccessful in indicating to researchers ways to improve synthesis methods."\n\n \n\n  Igor describes the problems encountered in developing and\n\nmodeling these molecules: \n\n \n\ninteractions in crown ethers is very difficult because they have flexible\n\nstructures.\n Calculation of the geometry of essentially flexible molecules is\n\na challenging problem in theoretical chemistry.\n These molecules have an enormous number of low-energy\n\nconformers, which make it difficult to search for the most stable structure."\n\n \n\n  So how does Igor find the stable structure?\n\n\n  that\n\nthe most stable phase of solids can be reached by very slow cooling from a\n\nliquid state temperature.\n We simulate this on the Convex Supercomputer to obtain the most\n\nstable conformer of a flexible molecule.\n We search for the most stable conformers of the empty and\n\ncomplexed Crown Ether by a  " slow-cooling"  Monte Carlo\n\nprocedure and molecular mechanics approach, followed by a high-level quantum\n\nmechanics checking of conformational energies. \n\n  Both these steps require enormous computational resources and can\n\nbe carried out only on supercomputers.\n All our calculations are carried out on the 4-processor Convex C3440\n\nat UWI."  \n\n \n\n  The other molecules Drs. Shamovsky and Szentpaly are\n\ninvestigating are just as fascinating.\n Clathrates form solid state structures that have spaces within the\n\ncrystal enabling it to contain gases such as Oxygen, Methanol, Propane and\n\nCarbon Tetrachloride.\n Clathrates may be used to develop storage and transportation systems\n\nfor dangerous gases or fuels.\n In fact, a crystal can be used to store mass and energy than the pure\n\ngas state.\n Research in this field is a strategic scientific direction in the\n\nPetroleum industries in the USA, Russia, Canada and Europe. \n\n  The UWI research on carcinogenic activity uses Dr. Szentpaly\'s\n\nMCS model of the chemical initiation of cancer in an international\n\ncollaboration with Dr. Schwerdtfeger, a former student of his, presently in\n\nNew Zealand. \n\n  DNA research is, of course, closely linked with cancer studies,\n\nand the UWI team hopes that some answers can be found as to what makes genes\n\nmutate and become cancerous.  \n\n \n\n  Igor, and the other researchers, feel that UWI Mona has one of\n\nthe best facilities for Computational Chemistry in the hemisphere.\n There are certainly none like it in Russia he says, and very few in\n\nthe USA.\n\n\n  " The University made a very wise step in investing in\n\nthis superb facility.\n I would like to thank the Mona Campus Principal, Prof G. Lalor for\n\nworking to establish this facility in Jamaica.\n I am grateful to Keith Manison and Jeremy Whyte for their kind help\n\nin installing the programs on the Convex C3440.\n What UWI has to do now is attract and invite more researchers\n\nhere to make use of these facilities."  \n\n  Igor will be making use of them for while yet.\n Due to remain in Jamaica until the end of 1994 he is enjoying living\n\nand working here with his wife Tanya and son Oleg.\n Oleg, by the way, seems to be a chip of the old block.\n He just graduated, at ten years old, from Mona Prep with A\'s in\n\nMathematics and Algebra.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  As promised this is the first progress report on the cam\n\n<l> pus network.\n A great deal has happened since the first issue of the this column\n\nappeared in February, and several users are now  " online".\n\n  \n\n \n\n  seen from the cover of\n\nthis issue of Superscan the UWI Super Pelican has got into fiber optic\n\ntransmission.\n In fact this symbol will be used to identify facilities and\n\ncomputers across the campus that are  " connected"  to the\n\ncampus network.\n " connected"\n\n symbol will be affixed to the machine.\n Each computer sticker will have a box that will be filled out with\n\nthe network address of the machine, and it should be prominently dis <l>\n\nplayed so that the address is clearly visible.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '118574ea-652f-4f6d-aed4-5c9b526c0641', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.424223+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9655638933181763, 'non_english_score': 0.03443610668182373}
{'text': "I HAVE to admit I was sceptical.\n Any time a giant corporation starts trying to convince me to start\n\nusing their new product for my own benefit, I get suspicious. \n\n  With Microsoft Windows, my suspicions proved largely correct for\n\nseveral years, too.\n The product was slow, balky, and a memory hog.\n It locked up my computer as often as it ran, and more than half of my\n\nfavourite software was incompatible with it. \n\n  But more recently, Windows has matured into a product that looks\n\nmore and more attractively \x13 particularly in comparison to OS/2, which\n\nanother giant corporation is trying to convince me to start using for my own\n\nbenefit. \n\n  One of the big reasons that Windows looks like a good\n\nalternative for many business installations is that the number of powerful,\n\nusable application software is impressively large. \n\n  Starting with Excel and Page-Maker, the list of useful software\n\ndesigned to run with Windows is as long as your arm, and encompasses most of\n\nthe important tasks that users like computers to tackle. \n\n  Another big reason is that processors running at 20, 25, and\n\n33 MHz tend to solve a lot of software performance problems that slower\n\nmachines leave open to criticisms.\n Today's hardware is a lot faster and more powerful than the machines\n\non which most of us evaluated Windows during the early years. \n\n \n\n  Windows is not really comparable to OS/2 from a technical\n\nstandpoint.\n\n\nsystem   , for example, and it doesn't have the potential for all the\n\ninter-process communications and automated integration among software,\n\nprocessors, and peripherals that IBM's new offering will eventually\n\nprovide. \n\n  But today, a user sitting in front of a PC equipped with\n\nMicrosoft Windows is in a good position to do a lot of fancy tricks that\n\nlook, feel, sound, and smell like the work of a graphics-oriented,\n\nmulti-tasking computer system running in much more than 640K of memory. \n\n  With Windows installed ( sometimes a difficult trick for PCs\n\nwith non-standard components or peripherals), you have a lot of options\n\nDOS never delivered.\n For example, several different programmes can be booted and\n\nsimultaneously held ready to run.\n Most software won't actually process unless they have direct access\n\nto the keyboard and the screen, but Windows will make them available in the\n\nwink of an eye, eliminating the need to close down one application before\n\nloading the next one. \n\n  640K memory limitation is effectively circumvented\n\nby techniques for swapping inactive programme code and data files\n\nbetween RAM and hard disk storage spaces, and by Window's ability to address\n\nmore than the meagre amount of memory that DOS ordinarily allows. \n\n  For programmes designed to run with Windows, the difficult DOS\n\ncommand line and word-based interface is replaced with a Mac-like\n\ngraphical one.\n This means you point the cursor with your mouse at an icon of the\n\nfile or computer process you want to access.\n\n\n  It also means that you can change how a programme or how the\n\ncomputer itself operates without editing a command file.\n\n\nand use the mouse to select the new choices you want to make. \n\n \n\n  One of the biggest remaining obstacles to its proliferation is\n\nthat the market contains far fewer application packages for Windows than\n\nfor DOS.\n But DOS, too, was handicapped in this fashion during its early\n\nyears of availability, and every month brings more Windows-oriented\n\napplications to market. \n\n \n\nWindows'  command and file-management capabilities without forcing\n\nyou back to native DOS.\n Some permit you to build custom menus to automate specific functions,\n\nloading and running specific application software against designated\n\ndata files, and performing other file-management routines.\n Others add more icons to Windows, including ones for file names, for\n\nfile deletions, and more. \n\n  With a set of high-end, Windows-oriented command files in place,\n\nan organization can effectively augment Windows to create    a   complete, custom operating environment for all\n\nits users that relies on  capabilities the way a 747 relies on\n\nthe Wright  basic concepts of flying machines.\n The resulting level of standardized operations and automated\n\nintegration of applications can significantly simplify day-to-day work\n\nwith PCs in large organizations. \n\n  Another reason to consider Windows over DOS is that many of\n\napplications designed for it deliver abilities far greater than their coun\n\n<l> terparts in DOS.\n Excel, for example, is far more powerful than DOS-based spreadsheets.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  AKE no mistake about it.\n The brakes of your vehicle is extremely important.\n\n\n  There is nothing more nerve-racking in driving than to apply the\n\nbrakes and find none.\n the bang, wham,\n\ncrash, pop.\n Our foot can tell a lot about the brakes.\n We merely step on the pedal and wait for the vehicle to obediently\n\nreduce speed. \n\n  This is fine at slow speeds on dry hard pavement, but requires\n\ndeftness and experience and good brakes under adverse driving condi <l>\n\ntions.\n Here's a simple illustration on how important proper braking\n\ntechniques are.\n Take your car up to Queen Hill, in the Meadow Brook area and let it\n\nroll down.\n Keep the brakes on slightly all the way to the bottom.\n Then get out and feel one of the wheels.\n Wet the end of your finger because the wheel will be quite hot.\n You will notice because of the length of the hill more pedal pressure\n\nis required as you get near to the bottom of the hill. \n\n  This is brake fade.\n Everytime you step on the brake think of heat.\n Remember that it is causing wear at slow speeds and can cause fade at\n\nhigher velocities.\n\n\n not   a friend of efficient braking.\n Friction caused by the rubbing of the shoes against the surface\n\nof the drums generates intense heat.\n Compare this as when you rub the palms of your two hands\n\ntogether. \n\n  The heat causes the surfaces of the brake shoes and drums to lose\n\ntheir abrasive qualities.\n This other, reducing the drag which causes the cars to slow down.\n 'FADE'\n\n  . \n Fade can be identified through a sponginess in the brake pedal and it\n\nnormally requires more    foot   pressure. \n\n \n\n  The dangerous part of emergency braking action comes when the\n\ndrums and wheels are locked up.\n This of course means that the tyres are no longer turning and one seg\n\n<l> ment of rubber is skating along the pavement.\n Frictional heat will build quickly to a point where the rubber melts,\n\nreducing adhesion even more.\n This accounts for the black marks on the road.\n In actual fact, the farther the tyre slides, the hotter it gets\n\nprogressively reducing adhesion. \n\n  Cars have 2 kinds of brakes.\n They usually have disc brakes on the front wheels and drum brakes at\n\nthe back.\n In a disc brake, a steel disc is fixed to the wheels and turns with\n\nit.\n When the driver presses the brake pedal, hydraulic pistons force a\n\npair of pads against the disc.\n This makes the wheel slow down.\n In a drum brake, curved brake shoes are forced against the inside of\n\na drum that turns with the back wheel. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  The mechanical brakes have levers that push the brake shoe\n\ndown to the wheel.\n Most light-weight bicycle use a mechanical brake, called\n\ncalliper brake. \n\n  The hydraulic brake use various fluids instead of levers of\n\ncables.\n In cars, the brake fluid is in the chamber called cylinders.\n Metal tubes connect the master cylinder with wheel cylinder located\n\nnear the wheel.\n When the driver steps on the car's brake pedal, a piston moves\n\ntowards inside the master cylinder. \n\n  air\n\nsupplied   by the machine called a compressor.\n\n\n  There is also the power brake which provide additional force for\n\nthe brake shoes on frictional pads.\n Many trailers use electric brakes which use electromagnets, attached\n\nto a disk on each wheel.\n When changed with electricity from a battery, the electromagnet\n\nactivates the brake shoes to slow or stop the vehicle. \n\n  Now, being more aware of the brakes in our vehicles, we will real\n\n<l> ize that driving in slow city traffic on dry roads is probably the best\n\nenvironment in which braking technique is the least important.\n One smooth application of our brakes to slow us from say 30 mph for a\n\nred light will do no damage be made gently, with the vehicle rolling\n\nquietly to a STOP.\n on the\n\nbrakes is abusive to the vehicle and does not usually save time. \n\n \n\n  Driving becomes more dangerous when the road is wet.\n The friction between the tyres and the road is reduced, meaning the\n\nbrakes may stop the wheel from rotating but the car will continue on. \n\n  us\n\n</>  use   the  'ON-OFF'  TECHNIQUE.\n '\n\n as this is not advised.\n\n\n  It is best to apply the brakes until the wheels almost stop turn\n\n<l> ing.\n Then release the brakes then reapply.\n By continuing this action one will find that speed fells off very\n\nquickly no matter how slippery the road. \n\n  When using the brakes on wet surfaces, DO NOT SLAM the pedal\n\ndown, especially if one has power brakes.\n A hard application for a second, where the tyres have no grip can\n\nlock things.\n Simply, depress the pedal smoothly and firmly at all times.\n\n\n\n  When approaching a corner, the one after leaving the Clarendon\n\nPark Railway Crossing for example, light braking will be required.\n A driver ought to leave himself with a margin in the unfortunate\n\nevent that brakes fail. \n\n  Look at this example, if a bend in the highway is coming up,\n\nback off on the throttle early enough so that it can be negotiated without\n\nthe brakes.\n If the brakes fail, unfortunately, one would not be in a\n\ntotally hopeless situation.\n As a skillful driver one would have gone through the corner a bit\n\nfaster, but at least one would have gone through. \n\n  We must remember that braking interferes with steering control\n\nand can be dangerous in corners, especially on slippery corners.\n We are sometimes reminded of slippery pavements by the sign SLIPPERY\n\nWHEN WET.\n The margin of which we speak cannot be looked at in terms of feet\n\nand K.P.H. and given to the driver in steps.\n It is something that a driver has to feel.\n Learner or new drivers will obviously have poor judgements.\n However, as they learn with and from the car, that margin of ? ?\n\nwill become more apparent. \n\n  It is important to consider that the gearbox can play a part in\n\nreducing speed.\n If the driver finds himself without brakes, he should not pave.\n It never help.\n Shift down to a lower gear for more engine braking.\n\n\n \n\n  In an emergency, brake hard up to the point of locking the\n\nbrakes, then release them.\n When the brakes are locked up, the tyres are no longer turning and\n\none segment of rubber is skating along the pavement.\n So when one hears, the screech of rubber and feel the vehicle\n\nsliding along, simply get off the brakes of a second. \n\n  Definitely, with some sort of obstacles looming up, the natural\n\nreaction is to stand on the brakes as hard as one can and stay on them until\n\nthe vehicle stops. \n\n  The seriousness of brake failure depends on where it occurs.\n Should one regrettably lose his brake on a steep hill, this is\n\ntrouble.\n Try to stop the car as quickly as possible rather than attempting to\n\ndrive out of trouble.\n The longer the car goes, the more momentum increases and the more\n\ndifficult to stop.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a512f425-cbae-4155-8d36-2a589a10b6e7', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.425589+00:00',

{'text': 'IN the early 1950s and 60s, to meet demand, the British\n\nconstruction industry produced hundreds of industrialised building\n\nsystems and prefabricated structures.\n Within 15 years, most had disappeared, their job done.\n The industry has now come of age, keeping the best of that era, plus\n\nnew ideas.\n Today, prefabricated buildings have to meet the regulations\n\nof a permanent building.  \n\n  The United Kingdom National Prefabricated Building Association is\n\nthe prime organisation to assure customers of the stamina and resilience\n\nof the new-style modular or volumetric buildings.\n " portable"\n\n are now often misnomers.\n Volumetric pods, which are modular components of larger, permanent\n\nbuildings, such as hotels, are themselves fixed structures. \n\n  The working life of a relocatable building depends on a number of\n\nfactors \x13 how much a customer wants to pay, what it is used for, where it is\n\ninstalled and how well it is looked after. \n\n  The market can be divided into three levels.\n At the bottom is site accommodation, which is built to a price and\n\nintended for short- to medium-term use only.\n Next comes the standard relocatable building, which can be five\n\nstoreys high and last for 25 to 30 years; add a pitched roof and face it with\n\nbrick and it would be better than many a traditional building.\n At the top of the range are post- and panel-built relocatable\n\nstructures, blurring the line between  " permanent"  and\n\n " temporary"  . \n\n  Today\'s prefabricated-building industry employs advanced materi\n\n<l> als and manufacturing methods.\n Although the simpler products are often built to a price, durability,\n\nappearance and performance can be considerably enhanced if the customer\n\nrequires. \n\n  The provision of pitched roofs and external brick cladding can\n\ntransform an assembly of basic rectangular units into a building almost\n\nindistinguishable from a traditionally-built structure. \n\n  In the past, prefabrication became synonymous with sub-stan\n\n<l> dard, flimsily-built  " huts." \n With the boom of the late 1980s, however, the techniques was\n\nrediscovered and re-established as an economic solution to the demands of\n\nfast-track programmes and maintaining high quality on large sites. \n\n \n\n  Tarrapin\n\n  Terrapin   .\n Established in 1949, it was instrumental in pioneering steel and\n\ntimber systems for a wide range of uses. \n\n  The current basic Terrapin unit building method is Uni-Trex,\n\navailable in single or two storeys, with flat or pitched roofs, and\n\nusing the best of modern technology.\n Advantages include quick delivery, fast on-site erection and\n\nversatility in design. \n\n  Retaining the wall characteristics of Uni-Trex but adding\n\nmany more quality features is their latest design, the Reflex PRC (\n\npermanent, reversible construction) based on a factory-fabricated unit\n\nconsisting of a roof, intermediate floor, ground floor and well panels,\n\ntransported to site. \n\n  In both unitary methods, the basic module comprises floor,\n\nroof and wall panels.\n Spans of 9.6 metres, 7.2 metres and 6 metres, and two ceiling heights\n\nof 2.4 and 2.9 metres are available.\n The buildings are quickly erected and can easily be expanded or\n\nreduced in size to accommodate change.\n They have high insulation levels for energy consumption, require\n\nminimal maintenance and can easily be relocated. \n\n \n\n  The pitched roof Uni-Trex method has concrete interlocking\n\ntiles site- applied to the 22.5-degree pitched roof, while the flat-roof ver\n\n<l> sion has monolateral falls.\n Reflect PRC is a high-performance development of the unit\n\nbuilding design, with a third skin or  " rainshield"  external\n\ncladding, which provides cost-effective, prestigious-looking buildings. \n\n  For longer term use, Terrapin\'s wide range of matrex steel-framed\n\ncomponent structures, together with the Terrapin design-and-build service,\n\neffectively provide permanent buildings. \n\n  The matrex is based on an efficient steel framer, which uses\n\na combination of cold-rolled lightweight galvanised-steel sections and\n\nstructural frame for suspended floor construction based on a twin-beam\n\nconcept.\n Essentially, this means pairs of lightweight steel beams are used\n\nwhere, conventionally, one relatively heavy hot-rolled beam would be\n\nemployed. \n\n  The matrex method was developed in 1978 and has been the\n\nsubject of extensive testing at British universities for durability and\n\nspeed of construction. \n\n  At the Auckland Park Development, Milton Keynes, in the En\n\n<l> glish midlands, a minor variation of the matrex frame has been used to\n\nallow for wider bay spacings and for expressed structures externally, which\n\nalso serve as a decorative feature. \n\n \n\n  Demand for homes, particularly in the public sector, and for\n\nshort-stay accommodation has increased in recent times.\n All forms of housing need are firmly back on local authority\n\nagendas. \n\n  Terrapin came to the aid of Southwark local authority in south\n\nLondon.\n A development of a single-storey pitched-roof housing unit was\n\ndesigned for a hostel, using Uni-Trex.\n Since the hostel was opened in 1990, hundreds of families have\n\nused it, and its success has led to a second phase of double-storey\n\ndevelopment. \n\n  The site was derelict recreation ground, previously a row of\n\nterraced houses.\n Considerable levelling and in-filling was necessary to achieve an\n\nacceptable base for foundations.\n The requirement was for three double- storey blocks, offering\n\naccommodation for up to 88 people in units catering for one person or\n\nwhole families, plus a single-storey administration building.\n Terrapin produced an exclusive design, in terms of size\n\nspecification, comprising high-quality pre-engineered timber-framed\n\nvolumetric modules. \n\n  The buildings were completed on site with single-skin brick-work\n\ncladding to the ground floor and stone aggregate GRP panels to the first\n\nfloor.\n\n\n \n\n  A software programme, permitting a client to obtain design\n\nand cost data for a new building almost instantly, has been developed by\n\nAstron.\n Some 30,000 buildings have been erected in 13 European countries\n\nusing Astron\'s welded portal-frame system. \n\n  An early example of this system was British Telecom\'s new perma\n\n<l> nent exhibition centre at the Goonhilly satellite earth station, in\n\nsouthwest England.\n Taking six months to complete, the building has a total floor area of\n\n747 sq. metre and is an Astron AZMI unit with a 20-degree roof slope.\n The building is 36.6 m long, 20.4 m wide, and has an eave height of\n\n4.6 m.\n Wall cladding is an Astron PA coated with silicon polyester, coloured\n\nivory, with 300-mm wide steel blue vertical stripes at the columns.\n\n\n  The essentially prefabricated nature of framed, lightweight\n\nbuildings permits use of newer cladding materials, making them suitable\n\nfor export as complete packages.\n\n\n" Financial Times"  print works in London\'s Docklands.\n Construction involved fitting tailor-made aluminium extrusions\n\nto the steel-framed structure.\n The vertical extrusions also act as drainage panels, combining\n\npractically with high aesthetic appeal.\n Cladding panels were then installed using face-fixing and other\n\nmethods.\n Internal metal lining panels faced with mineral wool insulation\n\nwere fixed to the steel structure. \n\n \n\n  Conder International claims to have revolutionised steel framed\n\nconstruction in the 1950s by introducing the portal frame, multi-storey\n\nbuilding.\n The pure aesthetic qualities of the classic space frame, its\n\nversatility and load carrying performance, have always appealed to\n\ndesigners. \n\n  Now Conder have produced the Harley system, with its two-way\n\nspanning capability and geometric symmetry offering exciting design\n\npossibilities for all types of industrial, commercial and leisure build\n\n<l> ings.\n The Harley 80 Space Frame, for example, can be arranged in a variety\n\nof forms; flat plates either horizontal or inclined, are the most common, but\n\nit is also possible to multi-layer the frame or connect flat plates, with\n\nstepped sections. \n\n  Plan module and depth are infinitely variable, however.\n The most common configuration is a 3 sq. metre module, producing an\n\nupper grid of around 2.1 sq. metre.\n Grid depths may vary between 1.2 m and 1.6 m overall \x13 the latter\n\nbeing the most cost-effective. \n\n  Flexibility comes from the manufacturing process, in which\n\nthe chords are roll formed to order and hold punched as required.\n Unlike most traditional space-frame systems, the top and bottom\n\nchords are continuous through the joint, eliminating  " in-built"\n\n deflections.\n Chords can be up to 15 m in length, depending on transport and\n\nhandling considerations.\n Where the frame is continuous over a number of supports it is\n\nusually constructed without camber.\n However, if the frame is supported on perimeter walls or columns a\n\ncamber may be desirable.\n This can simply be achieved by varying the hole centre punching\n\nbetween the upper and lower chords to create the desired shape. \n\n \n\n  Britain\'s Building Research Esstablishment ( BRE) provides\n\ninformation and advice on housing systems, particularly for\n\noverseas clients. \n\n  In the mid-1980s, a severe tropical storm hit the island of\n\nTonga, destroying or damaging more than 90% of housing.\n The Tongan Ministry of Housing and the BRE combined to\n\nproduce new systems to build 2000 houses over a two-year period. \n\n \n\ntions with tie-down hurricane bolts.\n Subsequent houses were constructed on suspended wooden floors\n\ntied to a grid of short-pile stumps, which were in turn cast into concrete\n\nfootings.\n\n\n  Simplicity was the watchword; the decision was taken to have only\n\none floor plan, suitable for later extensions by the owner.\n The plan is based on modular wall panels 2.4 m long.\n Each panel has either a door frame or half a window opening, the\n\nlatter panels made either left or right handed to provide full 1.2-m window\n\nopenings. \n\n  The panels are clad externally with either plywood or fibre\n\ncement board; there is no internal wall lining.\n Roof trusses were fabricated with hammer-in-type toothed plate\n\nconnectors.\n They were attached to the wall panels using proprietary steel straps.\n\n\n  The BRE took one of the houses and subjected it to full-scale\n\ntests early on, identifying weaknesses in the design and suggesting strength\n\n<l> ening in exposed locations.\n But the main success story of the tests was the overall strength\n\ncapability of the unit under a complete cyclic loading regime, with hidden\n\nreserves coming to light, to give a final failure load of 1.3 times the\n\ndesign value. \n\n  BRE subsequently developed a wind load testing device called\n\nBREWULF, which reproduces actual wind loads on the surface of buildings.\n Its main use is realistic proof testing of prototype wall cladding\n\nand roofing systems.\n BREWULF can also be used for certification procedures and for\n\n " forensic"  investigation of wind-damaged buildings.\n\n \n\n\n\n  With renewed interest in Kingston Harbour arising in the 1990s, a\n\nnumber of developments has taken place.\n The Task Force for the five-year development plan referred the\n\nsubject to the Cabinet and a Kingston Harbour Steering Committee was\n\nsubsequently set up.\n In 1991, an Action Plan aimed at cleaning up the Harbour was\n\nprepared.\n It is within this context that in 1992, the National Water\n\nCommission with assistance from the World Bank and the Canadian International\n\nDevelopment Agency ( CIDA) and in collaboration with Sentar Consultants\n\nLimited, initiated a project intended to provide a programme for harbour\n\nclean-up.\n The goal of this

{'text': 'Information Technology impact on business and maritime\n\ncommunities   \n\n \n\n  As we approach the close of the twentieth century, now is an\n\nopportune time to examine how information technology ( IT) has impacted our\n\nworld.\n This is the first in a series that traces some of the major IT\n\ndevelopments over the last three years, in which Port Computer Services has\n\nplayed a pivotal role.  \n\n  world has entered an era of\n\ntremendous change with concepts such as globalisation, right-sizing and\n\nbusiness processes re-engineering being today\'s clichés.\n Equally, talk of information technology and what is now termed the\n\ninformation age have become common-place. \n\n  To be sure, information technology ( IT), in the form of computers\n\nand telecommunications, is creating an environment in which information moves\n\nat rapid speed, and this can have positive spin-offs for the businesses\n\noperating in a competitive environment.\n Indeed, the changing realities of the global marketplace have resulted\n\nin a paradigm shift in the ways businesses function and have largely hastened\n\nthe adoption of appropriate technologies to ensure survival in the short,\n\nmedium and long term. \n\n  In a real sense, the information revolution is fundamentally\n\nchanging the way we do business, communicate with clients, market products,\n\nsource supplies and find buyers.\n ( industries\n\nthat exist electronically but do not have any physical premises) such as\n\nvirtual shopping malls and banks have sprung up in the past few years that\n\nwere not even dreamt of previously. \n\n  In the Jamaican maritime sector, Port Computer Services Ltd. (\n\nPCS), the Shipping Association of Jamaica\'s wholly owned computer subsidiary,\n\nhas being charged with the responsibility to spearhead IT developments on the\n\nPort of Kingston and the maritime sector in general. \n\n  PCS has led the way in the development of the locally shipping\n\nindustry\'s web site:  " seaportsofjamaica.com"  web site.\n The only interactive web site of its kind in the Caribbean basin,\n\nthis site showcases Jamaica\'s shipping industry to the world. \n\n  Interest in the site, which features Jamaica\'s port facilities,\n\nshipping companies and related agencies has continued to grow with positive\n\nfeedback being received from Internet surfers locally and abroad. \n\n  Port Computer Services Ltd. in a pioneering role used the\n\nintranet technology in conceiving, developing and implementing a one of a\n\nkind shipping industry\'s Wide Area Network ( WAN).\n pment to revolutionise\n\nthe process of information dissemination within the shipping industry, thus\n\nmaking it more flexible and accessible to others who wish to share in the\n\ntransfer of information. \n\n \n\n  The objectives that drove the project have been concerned with\n\nlinking all existing local area networks ( LANs) within the shipping industry\n\nto facilitate information sharing among members of the shipping fraternity.\n\n\n\n  Some of the benefits that WAN provides to connect users include:\n\n\n\n  &dot; The ability to send and retrieve electronic mail and\n\nassociated documents to and from other users of the network, which has\n\ncontributed to the reduction in the number of faxed transmissions between\n\ncompanies and the timely delivery of information to users. \n\n  &dot; All companies connected to the WAN can access port\n\nstatistical information and other data in order to assist in the effective\n\nmanagement of organisational resources. \n\n  &dot; Through the introduction of the WAN the door has been\n\nopened for the utilisation of more Client/Server oriented software.\n This has resulted in less waiting time during the running of\n\ninteractive jobs, thus speeding-up the rate at which information is processed\n\nand produced. \n\n  &dot; The WAN has facilitated a more centralised and secured\n\ndatabase, while significant improvements in systems response time have also\n\nbeen witnessed. \n\n  Given the competitive environment in which businesses must\n\noperate, these and other benefits provided by the WAN can only augur well for\n\nthe internal and external customers of the shipping companies who utilise the\n\nnetwork. \n\n  Indeed, the competitive nature of the business environment today\n\nand the increased focus on customer care and satisfaction have played an\n\nintrinsic role in the push to introduce and adopt emerging technologies to\n\nimprove the efficacy of businesses, as has been demonstrated by PCS and its\n\nwork in the local Shipping Industry. \n\n  While computerisation has been mostly concerned with automating\n\nexisting business function, we are now moving away from thinking about\n\nmanaging data towards managing information.\n By that it is meant, what information do we have about our customers\n\nand can we use it to help us manage our organisations better while at the\n\nsame time effectively meeting the needs of our customers. \n\n  The electronic manifest transfer initiative now underway in the\n\nlocal Shipping Industry has been geared at just that, improving customer\n\nservice.\n This initiative will result in major improvements in efficiency in\n\nthe cargo clearance process on the Port of Kingston. \n\n  The plan is to have shipping manifest information sent\n\nelectronically 24 hours before vessel arrival in the required format to\n\nJamaican Customs.\n Customs will then issue authorisation in the form of a certificate\n\nwithin 24 hours of the vessel\'s arrival.\n The whole process will result in a significant reduction in the time\n\nit takes to clear cargo, as data will now be received and processed even\n\nwhile the ship is on the high seas. \n\n  This means that a process which traditionally required numerous\n\ncopies of documents that was hand written at considerable clerical cost, with\n\ngoods taking several weeks to be cleared  will be replaced by a\n\nsystem that allows for clearance within a day.\n Additionally, the system will result in substantial savings to the\n\nimporter with less money spent on storage which will translate into savings\n\nfor customers. \n\n  The electronic checking of customs entries will also\n\nsubstantially reduce the high rate of errors and double entries in submitted\n\nmanifests.\n With goods being cleared in 24 hours there will be considerably\n\nimproved inventory management and less money tied up in goods.\n The process will also eliminate the arduous pre-clearance of\n\ndocuments.\n\n\n\n\n \n\nInformation Technology    \n\n  of technological systems to promote\n\ninternationally acceptable standards of productivity and efficiency has\n\ncaused ports in the developing world to have a level of equipment capability\n\nthat far exceeds other industries.\n This is particularly true of ports such as the Port of Kingston,\n\nwhich handles a large volume of transhipment cargo. \n\n  The Internet and other emerging technologies are also impacting\n\nall functional areas of today\'s organisations, chiefly the marketing\n\nfunction.\n Highly targeted marketing campaigns, for example, are becoming\n\ncommonplace. \n\n  With information available more quickly, at much lower cost, and\n\nwith much less need for large and cumbersome administrative structures, the\n\nwhole concept of centralised and hierarchical management is now coming under\n\nscrutiny. \n\n \n\n  More and more shipping interests are discovering that in the\n\nfuture, the most successful companies will be made up of people who have\n\nquick and easy access to the information that they require to make informed\n\nchoices about the best way to meet their  needs and,\n\ncrucially, will be given the responsibility and authority to act to guarantee\n\ncustomer satisfaction in a timely manner. \n\n  As Fred Luthans so ably articulated in his book, Organisational\n\nBehaviour, " it is the knowledge worker, armed with the requisite skills to\n\nmaster the demands of the organisation of the future, who stands the greatest\n\nchance of succeeding and prospering in tomorrow\'s world". \n\n  According to Luthans, for organisations to grow and develop they\n\nwill have to embrace what he refers to as the philosophy of the Learning\n\nOrganisation, where the organisation\'s internal customers are continually\n\nlearning and are empowered to bring acquired skills and knowledge to improve\n\nand enhance the productivity and profitability of the organisation. \n\n  Here, information technology will define how authority and\n\nresponsibility are delegated and how persons in functional areas of the\n\norganisation interact to enhance organisational value. \n\n  If there is one vital word that provides a focus on what is being\n\nsaid here, the word is  \'relationship\'  .\n For relationships within organisations will change-- between the\n\npeople at the centre and those closest to the customer in this information\n\nage.\n Relationships across organisations will also change--partnerships and\n\nalliances will become increasingly necessary to meet rapidly changing\n\ncircumstances, as evidenced in the moves by shipping lines in the global\n\nshipping arena to form a number of alliances and consortia to benefit from\n\nthe attendant economies of scales provided.\n Most important of all, it should be noted that relationships between\n\norganisations and their customers will change. \n\n \n\n  The information revolution presents us with many challenges,\n\nwhether we are in shipping or some other industry, but it also provides us\n\nwith the tools and the means to meet them.\n Every individual should get him/herself prepared through training and\n\nhands on experience in order to have a good chance of succeeding. \n\n  To be sure, information technology is revolutionising, and will\n\ncontinue to revolutionise, the way we work, and the next few years will see\n\nmajor changes in the way organisations in the maritime industry and elsewhere\n\nare structured and managed.\n These changes will be demanded by customers, made possible by new\n\ntechnology, and will be embraced by those organisations that want to survive,\n\nand moreover, succeed.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  hardly an office today that is not\n\ncomputerised.\n The change has been swift and adaptation equally quick.\n The use of fax machines, and the technology, which enables\n\nteleconferences and videoconferences, has rapidly increased the speed of\n\nmessages and reduced the need to travel to meet face to face. \n\n  Word-processing, graphics and desktop publishing have helped in\n\nthe quick production of polished presentations and enable quick revisions as\n\nwell as the easy personalisation of business letters and other documents.\n\n\n\n  It is difficult to remember what we used to do before the\n\ncomputer. \n\n  Yet, when IBM introduced its first personal computer in 1981, it\n\nhoped to sell only 250,000 machines over the life of the product.\n Ten years later, they had sold more than 55 million personal\n\ncomputers in the United States alone. \n\n  However, there are those who believe that computerisation in all\n\nits forms has been embraced in too wholesale a fashion by some businesses at\n\nthe expense of the personal touch. \n\n  Many would-be customers are turned away from businesses,\n\nintimidated by the numerous options of voicemail messages that they use.\n It is now a matter of debate, whether businesses that offer a\n\nservice, like banks, or airlines, should embrace this technological\n\napplication in such a wholesale manner.\n In fact, there are an increasing number of businesses in the United\n\nStates that are going back to the old way of doing business, with the\n\nemphasis being on the personal touch. \n\n  The promised " paperless environment" of the new computerised\n\nage, has also not been realised.\n In fact, there are those who can show evidence that their dependency\n\non the filing cabinet has dramatically increased, since the computer. \n\n  Yet, as we adapt to the various nuances of this new technological\n\nage, there are still many challenges to be faced, and still much to be\n\nlearned about the hundreds of applications of computer technology.\n Perhaps no industry is more affected than the communication industry.\n\n\n\n  Many are still wrestling with the mysteries and potential of\n\ncommunicating on-line, as well as interfacing computer to computer with the\n\nprint and electronic media - still the principal channels of public\n\ncommunication. \n\n  It is against this background that the local arm of the\n\nInternational Association of Business Communicators ( IABC) will be mounting\n\na one-day Seminar on Friday November 5, at the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel.\n Principal speaker, Charles Pizzo, who is IABC Vice Chairman and\n\nPrincipal of a New Orleans- based Public Relations Agency, PR Inc, states\n\nthat Information Technology for Communicators, ( one of the topics he will be\n\npresenting), is a practical response to concerns surrounding the issues of\n\nemerging technology and the need for these to be presented in a practical and\n\nconcise way.\n " Strategies for Online Communicators"\n\n , is also aimed particularly at the communicator who is expected to\n\nprovide information to management instantly. \n\n  " examine\n\nstrategic solutions that augment existing communications programmes with best\n\npractices for the online era including research, media relations, crisis\n\ncommunication, investor relations and marketing communications."', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'cd6c3f39-e028-4416-a63c-158f12c0becd', 'added':

{'text': 'past week or so the US Space\n\nAdministration Agency lost another of its Mars probes bringing to two and a\n\ncombined loss of US$320 million.\n Here in Jamaica perhaps only a fraction of one per cent of the people\n\ntake any interest in such matters.\n Clearly it is none of our business.\n Or is it?\n The event itself is of little consequence to us but what it might\n\nrepresent can be crucially important.\n Essentially it demonstrates the fallibility of technology; and\n\ntechnology is increasingly exerting a controlling influence over our lives.\n\n\n\n  So far there have been notable glitches in that technology.\n Even now we are still picking up the cost and enduring the concern\n\nover the so-called Y2K boo-boo. \n\n  Thirty or less years ago when the computer technology really took\n\noff apparently none of the geniuses who fathered it foresaw the problem the\n\nyear 2000 would bring. \n\n  When the famous Hubble telescope was first launched in space\n\nthere was an embarrassing mistake in either the manufacture or the instalment\n\nof a critically important component which required a super-human effort in\n\nspace to fix it.\n While the fixing was hailed as another indicator of human ingenuity\n\nthe silly mistake which made it necessary was widely ignored.\n Just before the latest Mars fiasco there was the loss of another\n\nprobe.\n This one due, we are told, to the failure to convert feet and yards\n\nto metric measurements. \n\n  Now closer to home there have been reports that regular use of\n\nmobile phones might be erasing part of our memory.\n Earlier there were allegations that radiation from these devices\n\nmight cause cancer.\n Even potentially of more concern are the doubts being expressed about\n\nthe possible effect on the human body of genetically-engineered crops.\n The dispute threatens to become a battleground between Europe and the\n\nUnited States. \n\n  Then there are the periodical introductions of what are called\n\ncomputer viruses.\n So far these have only been at the level of nuisances, but what if\n\nthese are only dress rehearsals for the real McCoy which will have the\n\npotential to cause massive chaos and dislocations which could have a profound\n\neffect on our well-being.\n Could a techno terrorist unleash his terror without the so far\n\ncharacteristic bang of explosives and from a location of his choice? \n\n  The pace of technological development these days in my opinion\n\ncarries one potentially devastating feature.\n It is so fast that there is no time to assess the possible\n\nramifications of one breakthrough before it is superseded by another.\n It is as if you are continuing to push food in one\'s stomach without\n\never allowing it to digest.\n The resulting accumulation could turn what was essentially a\n\nnourishing process into a nightmare overload and could insult the body to the\n\npoint of death. \n\n  Yet in the mad race for material advancement under the total\n\ncontrol of technology only the voices of the technologists and the vast\n\nconglomerates that they feed are being heard or at least being listened to.\n As the frenetic chase proceeds the voices of caution are being\n\nshunted aside or derided and scorned.\n Philosophers, thinkers, sociologists and others are being regarded as\n\nmerely quaint or archaic as technological juggernaut rolls forward backed by\n\nentities like the World Trade Organisation. \n\n  And a word about that organisation: it is interesting that the\n\nmeeting in Seattle recently ended in near confusion.\n The failure seems to be related to the spirited demonstrations staged\n\nin that city.\n As I watched the television coverage I was struck with the\n\nrealisation that there were no black or yellow faces among the protestors.\n If the obvious beneficiaries of the world arrangement can find such\n\ngrounds for alarm what about the people of darker hue who will be at the most\n\ndisadvantage?\n Are they asleep, or is Seattle just at the vanguard of greater unrest\n\nto come? \n\n \n\n  It is interesting to note that so far it is those who stand to\n\nbenefit most by the one size fits all approach who are up in arms.\n What will happen when those most disadvantaged by the\n\ntechno-economical orthodoxy wake up to their predicament. \n\n  In retrospect it was comforting when all we had to worry about\n\nwas nuclear warfare.\n Then, the two predators which dominated kept each other under\n\ncontrol.\n Now there is only one predator apparently hell bent on total control.\n To achieve that objective it will be necessary to keep the\n\nmalcontents tolerably quiet.\n That was attempted by massive propaganda which had even hungry-belly\n\nregimes like our own touting the global marketplace and the global village\n\nconcept. \n\n  Seattle is an advance warning that it will not work.\n Are there other contingency plans such as getting rid of nuisance\n\npopulations?\n Could AIDS have been deliberate or present a window of opportunity to\n\nthis end? \n\n  Will it come to that, or before that can occur some technological\n\ninadvertence intervene to repeat the process of levelling the Tower of Babel?\n Nature may in fact prove to be a virus, not wholly organic but a\n\nhybrid.  \n\n\n\n \n\nillustration \n\n  computer based tool for doing\n\nmarket research is now being demonstrated in Jamaica.\n It is called TRACE - an acronym for Tracking Response and Compliance\n\nEvaluation system. \n\n  TRACE is being promoted by Fujitsu-ICL Caribbean as\n\ntop-of-the-line research technology, an application to revolutionise service\n\nindustries especially in terms of timely response to data collection.\n Hotels, airlines, fast food businesses, marketing survey companies\n\nand the tourist industry as a whole are said to be all keenly interested.\n\n\n\n  The system incorporates a software programme, small hand-held\n\ndevices for data collection and a base computer to analyse findings.\n Basic training is provided by Fujitsu- ICL, which is based in the New\n\nKingston area. \n\n  ICL\'s Barry Nugent says TRACE will reduce time spent on a market\n\nsurvey operation from several weeks to a few days - and without the use of\n\nexpert programmers or data assessors. \n\n  Mervyn Eyre, ICL\'s chief executive officer spoke of the impact\n\nthis could have on the market. \n\n  " You can actually begin to get in touch with the\n\nspecifics of either a process or customer feedback and incrementally do\n\nfixes.\n The problem is that surveys are traditionally a laborious exercise -\n\neither they are at a very high level so that to be able to get down to the\n\nkey point of action is very difficult to do.\n Or by the time you actually get the data analysed it is obsolete and\n\nthe cost of doing such a thing becomes prohibitive,"  he said. \n\n  With the TRACE technology, however, manpower and cost for\n\nfieldwork are significantly reduced.\n Questionnaires are easily designed; data is entered into hand-held\n\ndevices and later downloaded into a base computer for analysis and response.\n Mr. Eyre said the system has wide application for several industries.\n\n\n\n  " This is very much interactive.\n Let\'s see how this is doing in the process.\n What about arrivals at Norman Manley Airport?\n What about the process of receiving Sandals customers?\n How well are we doing at this point?\n Let\'s do surveys here today, there tomorrow&dotted-line;.\n It gives you this type of flexibility to get in touch with the\n\ncustomer,"  he said. \n\n  Companies can buy the system outright or use it in association\n\nwith ICL. \n\n \n\n  Credit Unions stepped ahead as the fastest growing financial\n\nsub-sector in Jamaica - a sign, say its managers, of growing confidence.\n In the movement\'s monetary leadership and operational safety in an\n\nuncertain environment.\n Growth in assets to\n\n$9.4 billion during the past year was more than three times the rate of\n\ninflation.\n Savings shot up by one and a half billion dollars to an all time high\n\nof\n\n$7.7 billion. \n\n  These figures have emerged from the 58th annual report of the\n\nJamaica Co-op Credit Union League, an umbrella organisation for 67 credit\n\nunions islandwide.\n The report said that loans, the other growth area, had lagged behind\n\nsavings up until the third quarter, but a fourth quarter turnaround advanced\n\nborrowing by 23.6 per cent, an increase of\n\n$5.5 billion over the corresponding earlier period.\n Last year more than 25,000 new members joined credit unions in\n\nJamaica, an increase of 4.9 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n  can be regarded as the\n\ncommercialisation of scientific discoveries, has advanced in this century to\n\nan extent which has surpassed all the collective years of man\'s existence on\n\nplanet earth. \n\n  The advent of those technological advances have enabled us to\n\nmove faster, build higher, have the conveniences in our homes and know what\n\nis happening around the world in split seconds.\n But the world has to pay a price for these advances and with the many\n\npositives there are disadvantages which must be considered.\n We can consider some of the technologies that have impacted on our\n\ncivilisation over the last one or two centuries.\n\n\n  Energy technologies:\n The use of energy has been one of the most significant developments\n\nin recent times.\n Many indices of development relate the consumption of energy to the\n\nstatus of development.\n The increasing use of energy for transportation, industry, and\n\ndomestically has not been without a cost. \n\n  The increase capacity for the production of goods has also been\n\none of the results of that increased demand.\n The price that we have paid is an increase in the greenhouse gasses,\n\nthe serious erosion of the protective ozone layer in the atmosphere and the\n\ncreation of a level of waste material that taxes most disposal systems. \n\n  The problems will not go away and therefore the possibility is\n\nours to use energy sparingly, to minimise the creation of waste and to treat\n\nour planet with care.\n\n\n  Biotechnology:\n The advances of biotechnology in the last 50 years have been quite\n\nstaggering. \n\n \n\n  The scientific discovery of the cloning of cells has opened the\n\nway for the technology of tissue culture which enables scientists to\n\nreproduce particular species types without the prospect of genetic variation.\n\n\n\n  The concept of cloning has moved from plants to animals with the\n\npioneering and historical work in the cloning of the sheep Dolly.\n hat has been extended to mice and cattle.\n But should the technology be extended to humans as well?\n At least one scientist has that thought, in spite of the shock and\n\nmoral revulsion that the idea has generated. \n\n  The advances in the understanding of the genetic code for both\n\nanimals and man have created new dimensions in both the understanding of\n\nbehaviour and the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. \n\n  The modification of genetic pattern is now a standard procedure\n\nin plants and provides mechanisms for the enhancement of specific and\n\ndesirable characteristics such as disease resistance and other desirable\n\ntraits such as colour, shape, etc. \n\n  A worrying development for countries such as ours is the\n\ndevelopment of genetically modified seeds which produce seeds which are\n\nsterile.\n The seeds developed for a variety for reasons cannot be passed on.\n Clearly, for countries which desire to use the crops for the next\n\nyear, this creates a dependency which is unhealthy. \n\n  Readers will also be familiar with genetically modified meat out\n\nof the USA which is the subject of a dispute with the European Union. \n\n  Information Technologies:\n The development of the microchip has been one of the most\n\nsignificant scientific and technological developments in recent times.\n It has created the possibilities for an endless series of devices\n\nmany of which have advanced the art and science of communication on an\n\ninternational scale.\n The information age is here.\n The computer, the Internet, e-commerce are the new buzz words and\n\nhot topics.\n There is no question about the worthwhileness and value of these new\n\ndevelopments, but there are some down-sides and negatives that we need to\n\nappreciate. \n\n  &dot; A great deal of the information that is now posted on the\n\nInternet is worthless junk which is unedited and often erroneous. \n\n  &dot; The implications of pornography and its potential impact\n\non the population, particularly children is frightening.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '36b8fde8-b9bd-4d52-bc8f-f10b15c6bfc0', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.429869+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9682020545005798,

{'text': 'Bauxite mining in St. Elizabeth, viewed in 1980 by David\n\nReynolds ( in silhouette), chairman of Reynolds Metal Company.\n He toured the Alpart plant as part of his visit for talks with the\n\nGovernment on a\n\n$100 million development programme for Alpart, a consortium of Reynolds,\n\nKaiser and Anaconda.  \n\n \n\n  The announcement on May 3, 2000 that the United States Department\n\nof Justice and the European Union had approved the acquisition of  assets by Alcoa, and the de-listing of the former from the New\n\nYork Stock Exchange marked the demise of what had hitherto been one of the\n\nsix great transnational aluminium companies for most of the period since the\n\nSecond World War, and which through two of its subsidiaries, was a\n\nsignificant producer of bauxite and aluminia in Jamaica. \n\n  As I have written in detail elsewhere, the predecessor to the\n\nReynolds Metals Company was the United Foil Company which Richard Reynolds\n\nfounded in December 1919 at Louisville, Kentucky.\n United Foil\'s principal activity was the production of lead and tin\n\nfoil for the packaging of tobacco, an industry in which Richard Reynolds\'s\n\nuncle, R.T. Reynolds was established.\n The company began to produce aluminium foil in 1926, reportedly\n\nbecause it was finer and of better appearance than the tin and lead foil.\n Its name was changed in 1928 to Reynolds Metals Company which embarked\n\nupon a decade of growth.\n The headquarters which was transferred from Louisville to New York in\n\n1936, was transferred permanently to Richmond, Virginia in 1938. \n\n  The Second World War and, in particular, the U.S.\'s role in it\n\nused to have a major impact on, among other things, increased demand for\n\naluminium. \n\n  Richard Reynolds foresaw the entry of the U. S. in the conflict\n\nand the role which the metal would play in it, and along with others, worked\n\nceaselessly to ensure a greater role for Reynolds in the aluminium industry.\n\n\n\n  The War was to stimulate great demand for aluminium for aircraft\n\nmanufacture, tanks and automotive parts, ordinance, packaging, barracks,\n\nbridges, etc.\n The United States for example, produced 278,000 military aircraft\n\nusing some 1.5 million tonnes of aluminium between 1942 and 1945.\n By way of comparison, in 1939, the year when the war in Europe\n\nstarted, production was just over 2,000 aircraft. \n\n \n\n  The beginning of this mobilisation was the call by President F.D.\n\nRoosevelt, in August 1940, for the production of some 50,000 planes per year.\n Following this call, he created the National Defence Advisory\n\nCommission ( NDAC) the first of several control agencies established between\n\n1940 and 1945 to direct the country\'s production effort.\n In respect of aluminium, it invested some US$739 million ( of course,\n\nworth several times that amount in today\'s terms) in a number of facilities,\n\nincluding two alumina plants ( which were subsequently to be supplied, wholly\n\nor in part by bauxite from Jamaica); nine aluminium smelters; and a number of\n\nfabrication facilities. \n\n  Despite this huge investment by the U.S. Government, Alcoa, one\n\nof the founders of the modern aluminium industry ( as the Pittsburgh\n\nReduction Company in 1888) by virtue of being holders of the patent for\n\nreduction of the metal from its oxide, still dominated aluminium production\n\nin the United States, as almost all the plants constructed by the Government\n\nwere operated by that company. \n\n  Richard Reynolds tried to break Alcoa\'s dominance by seeking the\n\nsponsorship of the NDAC to build a primary aluminium facility, but was\n\nunsuccessful.\n However, he persisted, and through the intervention of Senator Lister\n\nHill of Alabama, the company obtained a loan of US$20 million in August 1940\n\nto construct smelters at Listerhill ( named after the Senator, it was said,\n\nas a  " thank you"  ) Alabama, and Longview, Washington for\n\nUS$15.8 million and US$4.2 million respectively. \n\n  Following the War, the U.S. Government\'s Surplus Property Board (\n\nauthorised by the Surplus Property Act of 1944) was charged with the disposal\n\nof Government-owned property.\n A number of influences were brought to bear in the formulation of the\n\nAct and subsequently, the composition, operation and focus of the Board.\n The U.S. House of Representatives and Senate held somewhat divergent\n\nviews on this matter.\n The House favoured a bill that would result in a speedy disposal of\n\nsurplus property with the highest possible cash return to the Government,\n\nwhile the Senate favoured a bill that would emphasise the fostering of\n\ncompetition. \n\n  The view of the Senate, ( and that of the Bonneville Power\n\nAdministration which supplied electricity to aluminium plants, other\n\nindustrial facilities, and individual homes in the Pacific Northwest) more or\n\nless prevailed.\n The result was that, in respect of the aluminium industry, the policy\n\nadopted by the Board required that: \n\n  &dot; Prospective competitors of Alcoa were to have first choice\n\nof plant and equipment; \n\n  &dot; Preference was to be given to bidders with the organisation\n\nexperience and financial resources that afforded the greatest prospects for\n\nsuccessful survival and maximum production in the industry; \n\n  &dot; Alcoa was to have an opportunity of taking over certain\n\nfacilities subject to the approval of the attorney general and only under\n\nconditions which would give it no competitive advantage. \n\n  Reynolds ( as did Kaiser) eventually benefited from this\n\narrangement.\n It was able to lease or purchase the Hurricane Creek, Arkansas,\n\nalumina plant, the Listerhill, Alabama, sheet mill, and the Troutdale,\n\nOregon, smelter.\n Reynolds also got the right to purchase bauxite from the U.S\n\nGovernment\'s stockpile for the Hurricane Creek, Arkansas, alumina plant, and\n\nthe right to the use of Alcoa\'s patents royalty-free at the plant.\n In addition, both Kaiser and itself benefited from rental terms\n\nvarying from 4 per cent to 8 per cent of the fair value of the plant\'s\n\ncapacity used over a five-year lease period and the granting of lease renewal\n\nand purchase options. \n\n \n\n  Despite these advances by Reynolds, an important link was\n\nmissing: access to bauxite reserves.\n Alcoa and Alcan ( which at the time were closely related), had\n\n \'shared\'  the bauxite reserves in the Guianas - the then\n\nknown main source of economic reserves in the Western Hemisphere - Alcoa, in\n\nDutch Guiana ( later Suriname) and Alcan, in British Guiana ( later Guyana).\n\n\n\n  Reynolds clearly recognised the strategic importance of access of\n\nbauxite reserves and accordingly, from as early as November 1942, through its\n\nvice-president, Walter Rice, wrote the US Secretary of State Cordell Hull,\n\nseeking the State Department\'s support by linking the access by the company\n\nto Jamaican bauxite ( which was positively identified by 1942, and over which\n\nAlcan especially, and Billiton of the Netherlands, had begun preliminary\n\ninvestigations) to the United  strategic interests.\n\n\n  \'The combination of these huge deposits ( Jamaica\'s) with\n\nlow-cost power and the billion pound aluminium plant in Saguenay River in\n\nCanada would enable the British Empire to dominate the international\n\naluminium markets for perhaps a hundred years, and would stifle the\n\ndevelopment of a large competitive aluminium industry in the United States...\n The problem is much larger than our company.\n Since we know of no ore discovery in recent years, of comparable\n\nstrategic importance, we believe the freedom to mine and ship bauxite from\n\nJamaica to the United States is vitally important to the industrial future of\n\nour country and our national security, and the issue cannot await the\n\ntermination of the war.\'  \n\n  This letter was followed by one to the U.S. Bureau of Mines, in\n\nJanuary 1943, seeking information on the bauxite in Jamaica.\n The Bureau responded by giving it some information of where it\n\nbelieved some deposits were located, the size of the ore bodies, and the\n\nchemical characteristics. \n\n  In the very same month, Reynolds wrote yet another letter, this\n\ntime to John Huggins ( later Sir John, Governor of Jamaica from 1943 to\n\n1950), who was then with the Anglo-American Commission in Washington,\n\nformally requesting the co-operation of the Jamaican Government in exploring,\n\nacquiring and mining ore. \n\n  This was followed by a visit to Jamaica, in February 1943, by Mr.\n\nRice and the chief geologist O.C. Schmedeman.\n They met with the Governor, Sir Arthur Richards during this visit,\n\nand requested equal treatment with Alcan and Billiton. \n\n  Among other things, the Reynolds team stressed the significance\n\nof exploiting the ore for the war effort: \n\n \n\n  Since it is urgent to produce high-grade bauxite in order to\n\nobtain maximum output of aluminium required for military aircraft, we would\n\nlike to have permission to proceed at the earliest date. \n\n  Sir Arthur wrote the British Secretary of State for the Colonies\n\nin March 1943 passing on  requests, and supported the\n\ncompany on the grounds that it was undesirable to give Alcan a concession\n\nover the whole island.\n ( It was clear that there was never any intention to allow Billiton\n\nto become seriously involved in the Jamaican industry, and, as it turned out,\n\nthe company soon left Jamaica for good).\n Support was also given by U.S consular and other representatives.\n\n\n\n  In the event, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, wired the\n\nGovernor to say that the matter was referred to the Aluminium Committee of\n\nthe Combined Raw Materials Board\n ( this Board was set up after Japan\'s attack on Pearl Harbour on\n\nDecember 7, 1941, by the U.S. and U.K. Govern-ments to co-ordinate their\n\npolicies in purchasing and allocating raw materials).\n The Board, comprised Sir Richard Fairy of the British Aluminium\n\nCompany, Mr. G.C. Bateman, the Canadian Metals Controller, and Mr. C.E.\n\nWilson, of the US War Production Board. \n\n  \'thumbs down\'\n\n .\n This decision was regarded as likely by Jamaican officials, because\n\nBritish Aluminium was closely allied with Alcan, and the Canadian Metals\n\nController would be hard put to go against his country\'s aluminium flagship,\n\nAlcan. \n\n  Reynolds learned from U.S. Government officials in May 1943, that\n\ntests of bauxite shipped by Alcan to Alcoa\'s East St. Louis, Illinois,\n\nalumina plant, could not be processed by the technology that had been used to\n\nprocess bauxite from the United States and the Guianas.\n It also learned from the State Department that the Aluminium\n\nCommittee of the Combined Raw Materials Board had rescinded its earlier\n\ndecision in regard to their application to explore and mine bauxite in\n\nJamaica. \n\n  \'turning\n\nof the tide\'  in favour of the Allies resulted in Jamaican bauxite\n\nnot being required for the war effort.\n participation in\n\nthe Jamaican industry had been removed.\n Clearance was given to begin exploration, and, in November of that\n\nyear, the Company secured options on 15,000 acres of land.\n It later purchased lands ( ultimately some 60,000 acres) and\n\nundertook research on the economic processing of Jamaican ore. \n\n  It moved to commercial operations on the bases of:\n ( a) its ability to develop an appropriate processing technology;\n ( b) the receipt of " Marshall Plan" Funds ( as did Alcan) from the\n\nUnited States Economic Co-operation Administration;\n ( c) attractive taxation regimes, both in the United States and\n\nJamaica;\n ( d) the stockpiling of bauxite by the U.S. Government;\n ( e) increase in the demand for aluminium for peace time uses as well\n\nas a result of the War in Korea. \n\n  The round of expansion to meet the Korean War effort as well as\n\nthe stockpile of the metal by the U.S. Government were particularly\n\nsignificant in creating the need for more bauxite, alumina, and alumina\n\ncapacity.\n One outcome of this need was the construction of the Corpus Christi,\n\nTexas alumina plant, by Reynolds to process Jamaican bauxite. \n\n  The company established its mining facility at Lydford, St. Ann,\n\nand a port at Ocho Rios.\n It had the distinction of being the first exporter of commercial\n\nquantities of bauxite from Jamaica.\n\n\n \n\n  It became a major player in Jamaica\'s economic life in three\n\ndistinct respects: \n\n  &dot; Mining and shipping bauxite for thirty-two unbroken years\n\nlargely to Corpus Christi, Texas, until the changing circumstances in the\n\nworld aluminium industry, including the worst recession in its history,\n\nresulted in the closure of the Lydford operations in December 1984; \n\n  &dot; Through the Alpart plant with which it shared joint\n\nownership ( first with Kaiser and Anaconda, and later when Anaconda divested\n\nits share, with Kaiser only) between 1969 and 1985.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'bb7dc6cc-92e5-466b-a58d-840ece4eaa6f', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.431214+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9667612910270691, 'non_english_score': 0.03323870897293091}
{'text': 'Florists could lose out on sales opportunities this Valentine\'s\n\nDay, because of a decision by the Government to ban cut flowers originating\n\nfrom cholera-infested countries of South America. \n\n  But local spokesmen for the floral industry have criticized the\n\ngovernment\'s decision, arguing that flowers come to Jamaica after satisfying\n\nquarantine requirements of the United States. \n\n  Florists claim that cholera cannot be transmitted by a flower,\n\nunless it is eaten. \n\n  This decision to stop the importation of flowers originating in\n\nSouth America was made by a committee comprised of florists and officials\n\nfrom the Ministry of Agriculture, sources told the  Gleaner  .\n That decision was made about two years ago when the deadly disease was\n\ndiagnosed in Peru and began to sweep across countries of Latin and South\n\nAmerica. \n\n  Some florists say that the fear of the Government seems misplaced,\n\nas major entities such as the World Health Organisation ( WHO), the Pan\n\nAmerican Health Organisation ( PAHO), and the United States Department of\n\nAgriculture have all conducted tests and have found that the disease is not\n\ntransmitted by flowers. \n\n  Most flowers which came to the island in the past, did so after\n\nsatisfying quarantine and other health standards of the United States,\n\nsources told the  Gleaner  . \n\n  Maurice Facey of Jamaica Floral Exports said that with South\n\nAmerican flowers satisfying the high health standards of the United States\n\nand Holland, the Jamaican Government, perhaps, needed to rethink its position\n\nregarding the importation of flowers from South America. \n\n  Dr. Barry Wint, Chief Medical Officer in the Ministry of Health,\n\nsaid that contrary to information reaching the  Gleaner  , the MOH\n\nwas not part of the decision to stop the importation of flowers from South\n\nAmerica.\n He said that the transmission of cholera via flowers was possible,\n\nbut an unlikely occurrence.\n It would become possible, he said, if a person on handling a plant\n\nwhich harbours the germ, then proceeds to handle food just before partaking\n\nof it. \n\n  that Jamaica grew most of\n\nthe flowers it needed for the local market, as well as for the export market.\n\n\n  Carnations, according to Geoffrey Shields, Managing Director of\n\nShields and Shields Ltd, is an indispensable filler for floral arrangements\n\nin Jamaica.\n Florists have no alternative but to import carnation as it requires a\n\ntemperature cooler than typical Jamaican climate, in order to thrive. \n\n  Mr. Shields and a prominent New Kingston flower dealer told the\n\n Gleaner  that the absence of carnation in the stores this year is\n\nlikely to reduce their potential sales for Valentine\'s Day. \n\n  " It is pathetic that they ( the Government) have taken\n\nthat decision,"  said the New Kingston florist.\n He claims to have lost about US$3,000 from a shipment of carnation\n\nfour months ago, which the Government burnt, rather than allowing it in the\n\ncountry. \n\n  Both Mr. Shields and Mr. Facey acknowledged that it was cheaper\n\nto import carnation than to attempt to grow it locally. \n\n  The inability to import carnation has resulted in a number of\n\nflorists importing silk flowers, cologne, stuffed toys and chocolates to fill\n\ngift orders that arise during peak seasons such as Valentine\'s Day, Mr.\n\nShields said.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  UNTREATED water, failure to collect garbage and offal have left\n\nthe Municipal Abattoir in Kingston in an unsanitary condition. \n\n  understands that meat at the abattoir is\n\nbeing washed with unpurified water from a nearby well.\n At present, there are two sources of water at the abattoir, the\n\nregular National Water Commission ( NWC) pipes and from the well. \n\n  It is said that attempts to get chlorine tablets from the Public\n\nHealth Department since last year to treat the water from the well have gone\n\nunheeded for over six months. \n\n  A Ministry of Health official explained that the main reason why\n\nmeat was washed was that during the slaughtering process parts of the\n\nentrails, which could be contaminated, come in contact with the meat.\n She said the chlorine tablets were expensive and had to be used every\n\nday to treat water, and that it is the responsibility of the authority in\n\ncharge of the well to acquire the chlorine tablets. \n\n  Added to the problem, there is an irregular collection of offal -\n\nthe entrails and internal organs - from the abattoir.\n\n\nGleaner  yesterday, that the collection of offal from the abattoir was\n\nirregular. \n\n  A KSAC statement noted that since Metropolitan Parks and Market (\n\nMPM) stopped removing garbage September last year, a private contract was\n\nsigned between the abattoir and Garbage Disposal Limited, a private company\n\nto do removal of garbage twice a week.\n " the service\n\nis not altogether satisfactory as on occasion offals are piled up for days\n\nbefore removal, due to motor vehicular problems."  \n\n The  Gleaner  spoke with the Manager of Garbage Disposals and\n\nSanitation, who said that her company was supposed to collect offals from the\n\nabattoir on Tuesdays and Fridays, but sometimes  " they weren\'t\n\ncollected on these days." \n Asked why the collection was not done on the prescribed days, she\n\nsaid  " just like other vehicles sometimes they ( vehicles) break\n\ndown." \n However, she denied signing any written contract to collect garbage.\n\n\n\n  The Public Health Department has been blamed for its tardiness in\n\nensuring proper sanitation at the abattoir, as citizens on premises adjacent\n\nto the abattoir, have been rearing pigs which attracts flies and exudes an\n\noffensive odour.\n Repeated attempts by the KSAC to get the Public Health Department to\n\nserve immediate notice on the citizens failed. \n\n  Between November and December last year, 2,588 animals were\n\nslaughtered at the abattoir and 1,196 animals were slaughtered last month (\n\nJanuary).\n Revenues collected during the November to December period was\n\n$161, 926.75 and last month collection stood at\n\n$72,364.50. \n\n  Apart from the irregular collection of offals, there is a large\n\npool of water at the entrance to the abattoir on Darling Street, because when\n\nit rains it takes days before the water recedes.\n Butchers and motorists have been complaining about this and as one\n\nKSAC Councillor puts it:  " It\'s like driving through the sea."\n\n \n\n  " with\n\nlimited resources in hand, management is trying its best to keep the abattoir\n\nat a reasonable and acceptable public health standard." \n The lack of telephone facilities at the abattoir was also causing\n\ngrave inconveniences and hardships. \n\n  The matter concerning the abattoir came up for mention at a KSAC\n\nTrust meeting yesterday.\n Mayor of Kingston, Marie Aitkins, spoke out against the bad condition\n\nof the abattoir, citing the bad condition of the entrance which she said\n\n " had become a permanent problem."  \n\n  The state of the animal pound was also mentioned and it was said\n\nthat the truck have been having mechanical problems since last month.\n Revenues collected between November and December from poundage fees\n\nstood at\n\n$31,044. It could not however, be ascertained, how much revenue was collected\n\nlast month.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  EXPANSION work, soon to begin on the Creek in Montego Bay, will\n\nbe displacing over 400 vendors at the Dry Goods and Harbour Street markets.\n\n\n\n  The Creek, which runs along both markets, is a shallow, narrow\n\ngully which overflows whenever there is heavy rainfall, affecting the flow of\n\ntraffic and operations of businesses nearby. \n\n  The leasee of the Harbour Street Market, O. Dave Allen told the\n\n Gleaner  yesterday that the St. James Parish Council had given\n\nnotices last month to vendors at both markets to quit the premises by March\n\n31.\n\n\n  " Some of these vendors are thrown in a state of\n\nconfusion concerning their future.\n They have constructed their shops - some at costs of up to\n\n$20,000 - and now they have nowhere to relocate or store them.\n\n\n  In a letter to the Council, Mr Allen described the notification\n\nas a suggestion of the Council\'s  " insensitivity and callousness.\n\n&dotted-line;\n You offer no hope at all to the former street vendors who have\n\nconformed to the directives of the St James Parish Council to leave the\n\nsidewalks of the city."  \n\n  in\n\ndislocating the vendors in both markets without an alternative could serve to\n\nundermine the efforts of the Council to keep vendors from the streets and\n\nsidewalks. \n\n  that\n\nthere was no truth in Mr Allen\'s claim that they were being dislocated.\n He said the letter to the vendors served only to advise them that the\n\nmove would be temporary and that a date was not yet set for work to begin.\n\n\n\n  " We are trying to avoid a situation in which the vendors\n\ncould later claim that they had not been informed of the project.\n A date has not been set, but the Parish Council has asked Government\n\nto construct concrete slabs over the areas where it affects both markets, so\n\nthat the vendors can re-occupy the premises as soon as work is completed.\n We have not yet received a reply to our request from Government.\n\n \n\n  " We are now in discussions with representatives of the\n\nDry Goods Market ( who contacted us) with a view to identifying and working\n\nout a temporary arrangement for their relocation.\n I do not have a problem with Mr Allen coming in and doing the same,"\n\n Mr. O\'Meally said.  \n\n\n\n  BOJ fuss heats up  \n\n  CONTROVERSY over the handling of foreign exchange purchases at\n\nthe Bank of Jamaica heated up yesterday.\n Finance and Planning Minister, Hugh Small clarified a statement he\n\nmade in Parliament Tuesday even as Opposition spokesman on Finance Bruce\n\nGolding attacked him for blaming others instead of himself and the BOJ. \n\n  In a JAMPRESS release, Mr. Small said his statement in the House\n\non the operations of the BOJ\'s foreign exchange agents made reference to a\n\nstudy of the Bank\'s foreign purchases which the Governor of the Bank,\n\nRoderick Reinford had requested of the Bank\'s external auditors, KPMG Peat\n\nMarwick. \n\n  The Minister\'s statement quoted the following passage from the\n\npreliminary report on the study:  \n " In general, we found that the US dollar purchases were at the rate\n\nper the daily rate sheet prepared by the Bank of Jamaica, but there were a\n\nfew exceptions."\n\n  This passage from the preliminary report, the release said, was\n\npurported to be in connection with the operations of the Bank\'s foreign\n\nexchange agents. \n\n  The Governor of the Bank has advised that the quoted passage\n\nrelates to purchases of foreign exchange from sources other than the bank\'s\n\nforeign exchange agents, and accepts full responsibility for the information\n\nprovided to the Minister on the passage in question. \n\n  The Governor also said that the report from which the quotation\n\nwas taken was a preliminary one, and that following a review of this\n\npreliminary report on the investigation, which the Bank and its external\n\nauditors have jointly conducted, a final report was now being prepared. \n\n  In the meantime, Opposition Spokesman on Finance, Bruce Golding,\n\nsays the  " tangled web of double dealing in foreign exchange\n\npurchases by the Bank of Jamaica which has called into serious question the\n\nintegrity of the Bank and the credibility of its statements to the public is\n\nnow being compounded by the attempts by the Minister of Finance to divert\n\nattention away from the Bank and to point fingers everywhere else except at\n\nhimself and the BOJ."  \n\n  He warned that Mr. Small\'s explanation to the public about the\n\nscandalous affair is that: \n\n  \n\n  Mr. Seaga failed in his duty to provide to the BOJ information\n\nof which he was in possession; the sub-agents are personally known to Mr.\n\nSeaga; Mr. Seaga is pursuing a political agenda designed to drive down the\n\nvalue of the Jamaican dollar.\n\n  "\n\nhe doesn\'t become involved in a cover-up."  \n\n  He went on to say that at every occasion Mr. Seaga has called\n\nattention to the practice of the BOJ in purchasing foreign exchange at rates\n\nhigher than published, he has been attacked by Mr. Small and other spokesmen\n\nfor the Government.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b9bd0247-3d4d-4b27-b044-04a7ac65981b', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.432496+00:00', 'english_score': 0.97865229845047, 'non_english_score': 0.02134770154953003}
{'text': 'ON THE PORCH of the Seaforth Health Centre a group of people\n\nsat... waiting in the mid  -  day heat.\n Their faces a mask of sadness, disappointment and hunger.\n They have been there all morning to register for aid, but were not\n\nable to see the nurse.\n She had gone home, they said, as there was no water at the health\n\ncentre.\n\n\n  Residents of sections of St. Thomas continue to live in misery one\n\nweek after heavy flood rains destroyed their homes, leaving scores of them\n\nhomeless, killed livestock, claimed one life and transformed the lush\n\nvegetation of Hillside, Sunny Hill, Seaforth and its environs into little\n\nmore than a dump. \n\n  But nothing perhaps is more unbearable than the lack of water.\n It was cut off in the devastation as pipes were washed away and the\n\ntreatment plant at Whitehall damaged.\n Life for these residents continues, but the going is rough for the\n\nyoung and old alike. \n\n  The Seaforth High School in St. Thomas was re-opened on Monday,\n\ndespite the fact that there has been no water at the school since last week\n\nTuesday.\n However, according to the principal, Mrs. Lurline Bowre, the school\n\nwas re-opened after the St. Thomas National Water Commission promised to\n\ntruck water daily to the school, particularly for the bathrooms.\n Water was sent there on Monday and yesterday.\n However, the tank at the school is not in use and water is collected\n\nonly in small receptacles. \n\n \n\n  When questioned about the health hazard and the discomfort to the\n\nstudents, Mrs. Bowre said students were told to limit their usage of the\n\nbathroom and to take drinking water to school with them.\n In cases where they have no water, it is provided by the canteen.\n that things were not so bad.\n The trucks took the water at noon and the cleaners did whatever\n\ncleaning was necessary. \n\n  bathroom area, a tenth-grade\n\nfemale student who was in the bathroom said:  " Miss you can\'t come\n\nbecause the bathroom dem not clean."  \n\n  The stench emanating from the bathroom was unbearable.\n The toilets were splattered with filth and had no water in them.\n It was obvious that attempts have been made to clean them, but the\n\nconstant usage coupled with the lack of water were responsible for the\n\nexisting unsanitary conditions. \n\n  bathrooms were in a worse state and the stench\n\nhung in the air outside the schoolyard and in the nearby classrooms. \n\n  , said they tried\n\nnot to use the bathroom because of the state they were in, and even though\n\nthey did not take any water to school, could manage without it until they got\n\nhome. \n\n  The student who was seen in the bathroom, said some of them came\n\nfrom far and have to use the bathroom in spite of the smell because they\n\ncould do no better. \n\n  Yet the students are not the only ones who have to put up with\n\nthe discomfort.\n The residents at the nearby housing scheme said the situation is\n\nextremely terrible despite the fact that water is trucked to the area daily.\n\n\n\n  Mrs. Lorna Gibson, a senior teacher who lives at the housing\n\nscheme, said if they were not at home when the truck came they had to do\n\nwithout water. \n\n  There was still a lot of cleaning up to do as heavy mud residue,\n\naftermath of the flood rains, needs continuous cleaning.\n In addition, clothing, carpet and other household items must be\n\ncleaned.\n\n\n  Residents say water is trucked daily to the area, but most of\n\nthem have lost receptacles that they had and therefore could get only a\n\nlittle when the truck came.\n When that is finished they have to travel up to four miles to get\n\nwater. \n\n  When contacted, a senior person at the St. Thomas National Water\n\nCommission office said they will continue to truck water to the area until\n\nthe treatment plant is repaired.\n He explained that because of the nature of the terrain, the area had\n\nto be cleared manually and this is taking a little time.\n However, he hoped the repairs will be completed by Saturday and\n\nnormalcy in the water supply should return by Sunday.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  THE fine for persons convicted for playing loud music at nights\n\nwill soon move from the present\n\n$40 to\n\n$10,000 or three months imprisonment. \n\n  With a second conviction for the same offence, the operator of\n\nthe offending sound system will be liable to a fine of\n\n$15,000 or six months imprisonment. \n\n  National Security and Justice Minister K.D. Knight gave those\n\nassurances as he announced that legislation was in the making to deal with\n\nnight noises that disturb the peace. \n\n  He was speaking on Tuesday at the launch of the JIS sponsored\n\nseries, " Face to Face Forum" held at the Meadowbrook High School.\n Other Government Ministers present included Robert Pickersgill,\n\nEaston Douglas, Carlyle Dunkley and Burchell Whiteman. \n\n  Mr. Knight also said that owners of the properties on which the\n\nmusic is transmitted, would also be liable, to  " heavy"  and\n\n " realistic fines"  . \n\n  He, therefore, warned sound system operators and property owners\n\nto  " beware"  as the legislation would soon be enacted.\n "\n\nhave a deterrent effect and soon children will be able to study in their\n\nneighbourhoods without being subject to this ( night noises) kind of\n\nactivity."  \n\n  Minister Knight pointed out that at present the law stipulates\n\nthat sound systems should not allow music to extend beyond 100 yards of the\n\nsource of the music.\n He noted that existing law makes a convicted offender liable to pay\n\n$40. \n\n  The existing law also stipulates that the Police, on being\n\nalerted to a case of noise pollution, are obliged: firstly to speak to the\n\noperators, asking them to turn down the sound; secondly, if the volume is\n\nturned up again after the police leave the equipment may be seized.\n Thirdly, on seizing the equipment the police are required to get the\n\nconsent of the Clerk of the Court to prosecute the offender. \n\n  The National Security Minister expressed the view that the\n\npresent system of administering justice to offending sound system operators\n\nwas cumbersome.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  SCORES OF STUDENTS from Denham Town and St. Anne\'s Secondary\n\nschools, paid their last respect to 16-year-old Mae Robinson, in a special\n\nMemorial Service held at the St. Anne\'s Catholic Church yesterday. \n\n  Mae Robinson was murdered on December 13, 1992 and her torso\n\nfound in a bucket floating in the sea behind the Kingston Ice Factory three\n\ndays later.\n Her pelvic region was discovered in the sea on Friday December 18, in\n\nthe vicinity of the WISYNCO Fishing Complex. \n\n  Her head was found a few days later along the seashore of the Old\n\nAirport Runway. \n\n  Emotion was very high, as several students were moved to tears\n\nwhen the hymn  " Special Memories"  was sung by a group of St.\n\nAnne\'s girls. \n\n  There was a hush in the church as members of the congregation,\n\nincluding school teachers, listened to the hymn. \n\n  Father D. Adams, S.J., the officiating priest, described Mae\n\nRobinson as a child of God. \n " Last year there were nearly 600 murders, if my calculation is\n\ncorrect.\n Father Adams\n\nsaid. \n\n  Miss Clover Thompson, Principal of Denham Town Secondary, said\n\n " I am very sad to stand here and speak about one of our own students\n\nand today Denham Town mourns the loss of one more pupil." \n\n  " Mae has been a student of Denham Town for the past four years.\n She got enrolled in 1987 from grade seven up to grade 10.\n She was blossoming among the beautiful flowers we planted.\n Mae was eager to learn, willing, pleasant and always wanted to become\n\na cosmetologist, but today she is gone,"  Miss Thompson said. \n\n  " Mae was robbed from the society in a\n\ngruesome, callous and brutal way.\n\n\n  The autopsy performed on Mae\'s torso shortly after it was found,\n\nrevealed that her body was cut into pieces by a power machine saw.\n\n\n  The police has detained a security guard in connection with the\n\nmurder, but because of lack of evidence, the man was released.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \'entertainment\'\n\n to substance  \n\n  A CONCERTED appeal has been made for election campaigning to take\n\non a new focus in Jamaica, with meaningful debates among candidates of all\n\ncontesting political parties. \n\n  Newly-appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of Crown\n\nEagle Life Insurance Company, Geoffrey Messado, The Press Association of\n\nJamaica ( PAJ) and the Christian United Party ( CUP) are leading the push for\n\nnational debates leading up to what is expected to be an early general\n\nelection. \n\n  " Instead of the\n\nentertainment of the street rally and the strong arm tactics that are\n\nmagnified in the garrison constituencies, we should call for structured\n\ndebates between the candidates on national television and community centres."\n\n \n\n  The Press Association is planning to promote a series of national\n\ndebates with prospective candidates as a run up to the general elections.\n\n\n\n  Last night the PAJ launched its 1993 series of public forums with\n\ndiscussion on the topic  " National Expectations For The Next General\n\nElections"  at the Pegasus Hotel, Kingston. \n\n  CUP has written to the PAJ requesting that it convenes a series\n\nof debates involving them ( CUP) and the two major political parties. \n\n  " within the framework of a\n\ndebate inclusive of the third major political party, which in this case is\n\nthe CUP, can objective, frank and penetrative discourse take place which may\n\nadequately throw new light and new ideas on hitherto unknown facts and lost\n\nideals." \n\n  Speaking yesterday at the Lions Club of New Kingston luncheon\n\nheld at The Pegasus hotel, Mr. Messado said that while the public forums\n\nbeing held by the political parties is a start, it is not good enough, as no\n\none should be voted in as Member of Parliament, if he or she does not agree\n\nto have a face-to-face debate with his opponent. \n\n  Mr. Messado challenged the Lion\'s club members that they ( in\n\ntheir capacity as a service club) should be instrumental in organizing and\n\nhosting at least one such debate or forum. \n\n  He added that now that elections were in the air, the issue of\n\nConstitutional reform should be addressed by candidates contesting the\n\nelections and efforts should be made towards this. \n\n  Referring to the United States Constitution, Mr. Messado said\n\nthere were some good points that could be emulated by Jamaica.\n One example he cited so far was that of having a fixed election date.\n\n\n\n  " This does not allow for any manipulation of the date to\n\ngive any advantage to the incumbent party."  \n\n  He went on to state that elections should not be called simply at\n\nthe time when the local pollsters indicate that the particular party is ahead\n\nin the polls.\n Another issue, he mentioned, was that the Senate should consist of\n\nelected members and the Legislature should be separate from the Executive.\n This separation, he said, would provide some checks and balances in\n\nthe political system.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  DEMOCRACY defined as government of the people by the people for\n\nthe people, has never been practised by anybody in its strict sense. \n\n  Instead, democracy is best defined as the government of the\n\npeople by some people for the people, according to Professor Emmanuel\n\nUgochukwu, Nigerian High Commissioner to Jamaica.\n He was addressing a meeting of the Rotary Club of Kingston-Downtown\n\nat the Oceana Hotel yesterday, on  " democratizing democracy"  .\n\n\n\n  " I am a firm\n\nbeliever in the government of the people by the people for the people."\n\n\n His thesis however, was that it had never worked and that certain\n\npowerful interests worldwide were bent on ensuring it never works.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'says Carl Rattray \n\n \n\n  MEMBERS of the Joint Select Committee which met to discuss the "\n\nOffences Against the Person Act," yesterday, became entangled in a verbal\n\ntussle over whether there is a rationale in linking a weapon to an offence.\n\n\n\n \n " The Gun Court legislation in my view has been a dismal failure\n\njurisprudentially and factually.\n I will state it on any platform, any place.\n Because the concept of attaching the offence to the weapon is a wrong\n\nconcept and that is why it failed and I do not want us to perpetuate\n\nfailure,"  Attorney General, Carl Rattray told the meeting. \n\n  Comprised of members of the House of Representatives and the\n\nSenate, the committee met to examine the bill to   \n\namend   the existing Act which is intended to make provision for the\n\nretention of the death penalty in respect of specific offences defined as\n\n " capital murders."  \n\n  Mr. Rattray, who evidently felt strongly about the issue, was\n\nquite vocal in his opposition to any form of linkage. \n " In my view there is absolutely no rationale in making a connection\n\nbetween the weapon and the offence.\n\n\n  Referring to recommendations made by a committee headed by the\n\nlate Aubrey Fraser, Mr. Rattray recalled that the committee had focussed\n\nparticularly on  " murders with guns,"  and had recommended\n\ncapital punishment for such offences. \n\n \n " It was only murder that it was preserving.\n The committee did not go into anything else.\n\n\nMr. Rattray said. \n\n \n\n  At this point, chairman of the Select Committee, K.D. Knight,\n\nasked the Director of Public Prosecution, Glen Andrade,  " Why is it\n\nthat that committee felt it so important to isolate that from all other."\n\n \n\n \n " Because that committee, in my view was wrongly following the trend\n\nwhich was set at that time in the Gun Court legislation which was new and\n\nwhich we did not have the experience of.\n We now have the experience of the Gun Court legislation and it has\n\nnot succeeded in reducing gun crimes."  \n\n  " Did the Gun Court attach an offence to the\n\nweapon?"  \n\n \n\n  " How could it do that? Assist me on that."\n\n \n\n  " The Gun Court created a system of\n\njurisprudence in which it isolated offences committed with a gun and created\n\na special court and a special method of trial for it all directed at the gun.\n It abolished in that court the right to trial by jury except where it\n\nwas fatal and it focussed on the weapon as the centrepiece of that\n\nlegislation."  \n\n  " any attempt to make the\n\nweapon the centrepiece of the crime and to create legislation which is going\n\nto be based on making the gun the central element which makes the offence\n\ncapital, will be a failure just like the Gun Court."  \n\n  Opposition member Bruce Golding, supporting Mr. Rattray\'s view,\n\nargued that if a man acquires a knife with the intention to kill, then he is\n\nas much somebody that we ought to get to as the man who does it by using a\n\ngun. \n\n  " A man who has acquired an M16,\n\ncan he have any intention but to kill?\n\n\n \n\n  " In one instance he must have had and in the\n\nother instance he need not have had."  \n\n  " With respect Sir, I am not a lawyer but if\n\nyou are framing law it seems to me that what you are to be focussing on is\n\nnot what he might have intended but what his real intention was once you have\n\nestablished it.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  MOST owners of home satellite systems with doctored modules (\n\nboxes), are anxiously waiting to see what will happen with their systems,\n\nwhen General Instruments starts switching over to the VideoCipher 11-Plus\n\ndescrambling units by the end of this month. \n\n  Obviously, the well-heeled fat cats who can afford US$300 out of\n\npetty cash, would have bought their VideoCipher 11-Plus by now and are\n\ngetting ready to subscribe to their favourite channels through addresses in\n\nthe United States. \n\n  There is an assumption by some people that those who own home\n\nsatellite systems are wealthy.\n Nothing is further from the truth.\n Many of the people who own these systems are hard-working,\n\naverage-Joe citizens, who wanted to own the greatest home entertainment\n\nsystems in the world.\n "\n\ncultural invasion"  in the early days of satellite systems in this\n\ncountry, are now proud owners of home systems.\n Apparently, their intelligence is superior to that of other\n\nJamaicans, and will not be influenced by that so-called  " cultural\n\ninvasion"  . \n\n  The people who own home satellite systems have to be careful,\n\nespecially now, and protect themselves from rip-off artists in the business.\n These rip-off artists will be telling people they are able to crack\n\nthe codes of the VideoCipher 11-Plus for exorbitant prices. \n\n  My last article on Satellite Viewing drew the wrath of a number\n\nof people who claimed they were satellite dealers and technicians.\n Some of these people feel that because they are capable of aligning a\n\ndish with the satellites they are technicians, and will try to dazzle their\n\ncustomers with high technology terms which they themselves do not understand.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Fact is: the ordinary Joe can align his own dish by simply\n\nfollowing the instructions provided by the manufacturer.\n It is not difficult, and to make it even easier are the very smart\n\nreceivers and Integrated-Receiver-Descramblers ( IRDs).\n The only thing they cannot do is to physically set up the dish.\n So do not be taken in by those spouting a lot of hi-tech nonsense.\n\n\n\n  A friend, one of the decent and fair people in the business,\n\nagreed with me that there are some less than honest people dealing with the\n\nunsuspecting owners of home satellite systems. \n\n  There are also those who are called " middlemen", who will charge\n\ntwice the amount, for programming a module ( box): the middlemen will take\n\nyour box to someone like my friend who actually programmes the box and\n\ncharges him five hundred dollars for the job, including the chip.\n The middlemen then takes the box back to its owner and charges a\n\nthousand dollars for the job.\n He has made five hundred dollars for merely pulling out the module\n\nfrom the VideoCipher unit or IRD, something which the owner could have done\n\nand saved himself five hundred dollars. \n\n  And there are programmers and programmers.\n Some people will give you a programme that will make it necessary for\n\nyou to call him at the start of each month for new Wizard Codes for a fee.\n This will be necessary because the codes are changed at the beginning\n\nof each month.\n Now, there are other people who will give you a programme that will\n\nautomatically receive the new codes at the beginning of the month and you\n\nonly have to pay once for that programme.\n\n\n  Be a good customer, and treat home satellite systems as any other\n\nconsumer item and look around for value for money.\n Do not panic in the face of the introduction of the VideoCipher\n\n11-Plus.\n The word out in the world of piracy in the United States and Canada\n\nis that there is a programme out there waiting to crack the scrambling system\n\nbeing introduced next month.\n It should be made clear also that not all the major television\n\nprogrammers are moving to the new system next month.\n\n\n  I found the Jamaica vs Trinidad and Tobago football feed from\n\nKingston to T-and-T last Sunday on Galaxy 6, channel 19. G-6 is the interim\n\nreplacement of Westar 4 which was shut down late last year.\n If your receiver was programmed for Westar 4, you will be able to\n\nfind G-6 by just punching in Westar 4 on your receiver.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  A PRE-DAWN attack in which four persons, including three from one\n\nfamily, were massacred in South West St. Andrew yesterday, and a fifth\n\nseriously wounded, has triggered an emergency meeting of Kingston\'s political\n\nrepresentatives and those representing the top two crime-ridden St. Andrew\n\nconstituencies. \n\n  The meeting between Government, Opposition Members of Parliament,\n\nand constituency caretakers of Central, East and West Kingston, South and\n\nSouth West St. Andrew, was scheduled for 3 p.m. yesterday with Minister of\n\nNational Security and Justice, K. D. Knight, and the police, in an effort to\n\nrestore peace and stability. \n\n  Senator Peter Phillips, Minister without portfolio in the Office\n\nof the Prime Minister told the  Gleaner  the meeting was scheduled\n\nto be convened at another time, but it had been brought forward because of\n\nthe murders yesterday morning.\n He said the society was under threat from criminals, and the meeting\n\nhad been planned to discuss how they could ensure there was peace and calm.\n\n\n\n \n\n  The bullet-riddled bodies of Stanford Spence: his sons Garfield,\n\notherwise called  " Checkface"  , and Jervis, otherwise called\n\n " Casper"  ; and Patricia Campbell, 26, Garfield\'s common-law\n\nwife, were found in two houses in Arnett Gardens about eight chains apart\n\nafter the shooting died down around 2 to 2.30 a.m.\n common-law wife who is reportedly pregnant, was shot\n\nand hospitalised in serious condition. \n\n  A yet unspecified number of gunmen, believed to have gained entry\n\neither through windows or by breaking down doors, staged the attack, first at\n\nLot 49, \'Mexico\', where the elder Mr. Spence lived with his son Jervis.\n\n\ncommon-law wife. \n\n  The father ran to nearby \'Angola\' to tell his son Garfield what\n\ntranspired, but the gunmen reached Garfield\'s home the same time as Mr.\n\nSpence, cut down the older man, as well as Garfield and Campbell, Garfield\'s\n\ncommon-law wife. \n\n  Police said they had not established a motive for the slayings.\n Some police sources believed the deaths were the result of a gang\n\nfeud. \n\n  One or two of those killed were believed to have had connections\n\nwith Radcliffe Rowe, who led a gang in South West St. Andrew and who, up\n\nuntil the wee hours of Saturday, August 15, was Jamaica\'s most wanted man.\n\n\n\n  Rowe, who was facing multiple murder charges, escaped from police\n\ncustody on May 22, this year. He was killed while reportedly trading shots\n\nwith police during a raid in \'Mexico\', Arnett Gardens, last Saturday. \n\n \n\n  There were suggestions that the Spences were killed by surviving\n\nmembers of Rowe\'s gang, who labelled them  " informers"  and\n\nof  " setting up"  the gang leader\'s demise. \n\n  However, police do not believe that was the reason the Spences\n\nwere murdered.\n There were people in the communities who could not believe that their\n\n " Robin Hood"  Rowe was dead.\n\n\n  Tension filled the air yesterday and was even more pronounced\n\nwhen sporadic gunfire broke out while reporters, Flying Squad detectives led\n\nby Supt. Garnett Daley and other heavily-armed policemen, residents and\n\ncurious onlookers from nearby communities gathered at the crime scenes, no\n\nmore than about four chains from the Trench Town police station.\n The murders prompted a number of people to move from Arnett Gardens\n\nyesterday. \n\n \n Member of\n\nParliament Bobby Jones declared as he spoke with the residents.\n He referred to previous statements he had made about Rowe and other\n\nmen walking  " up and down"  heavily- armed and of his advice\n\nnot to hide criminals. \n\n  He linked yesterday\'s murders not to political warfare, but to\n\ngang members associated with Rowe and who were living in Rema.\n " big guns"\n\n along with men from Rema, that some citizens  " back him"\n\n and hid him from the police.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '92539afe-1620-4602-9792-6a076bb23105', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.435104+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9833365082740784, 'non_english_score': 0.01666349172592163}

their exams thus leaving the CLASS students\n\non their own. \n\n  However, Executive Director of IMS, Winston Adams denied the\n\nallegations. \n\n  According to a past teacher who taught at CLASS for three months\n\nlast term, in October several teachers received  " bounced"\n\ncheques as salary payments, due to internal financial problems at the\n\ninstitution. \n\n  Consequently, those teachers have not returned to teach at the\n\ninstitution, the teacher said. \n\n  Classrooms at the institution on Tuesday were empty except for\n\nseveral students who were doing work on their own. \n\n  " It is really sickening that I come here wasting the day\n\nwaiting to have class and the teacher does not turn up,"  said one\n\n17-year-old student. \n\n  " I just got a GCE maths teacher\n\nthis morning after the first one left last term, because of  "\n\nbounced"  cheques payments."  \n\n  The students said they were especially worried about sitting some\n\nof the subjects, such as Mathematics, without the help of a teacher. \n\n  Michelle, another student, said she had requested a refund from\n\nIMS in order to attend another day class, but was told that she was not\n\nentitled to a refund after November. \n\n \n\n  Mr. Adams said, however, that IMS, a business institution, was\n\nnot having financial problems but that the CLASS programme which was started\n\nin 1991 was having financial problems in terms of the administration of the\n\ninstitution. \n\n  He explained that CLASS, a university undergraduate/postgraduate\n\nprogramme, was designed to assist private candidates who wished to sit\n\noverseas GCE and CXC subjects. \n\n  He said CLASS has operated since 1984 as a small project\n\nproviding a means of livelihood for university students.\n However, due to an increase in the scope of the programme IMS\n\nintroduced the day programme at CLASS in 1991.\n CLASS is the acronym for Council for Literature, Arts and Science\n\nStudents. \n\n  The problem with the administration of the programme, which is\n\nmade up of post and undergraduate students of the UWI started that same year,\n\nhe said. \n\n  He explained that the problem arose when six computers leased at\n\n$110,000 were stolen from the CLASS office at the Mona Campus.\n\n\nteachers\'  salary pool. \n\n  " In order to pay the teachers we had to negotiate with\n\nthe bank to go into an overdraft.\n\n\noccurred   on two occasions,"  Mr. Adams said. \n\n  He denied the allegations that teachers were paid with " bounced"\n\ncheques, saying that only two or three  cheques were\n\nreturned by the bank, as the overdraft was still pending during October when\n\nthe next payment was made.\n But since October the institution has not had a financial problem, he\n\nsaid. \n\n  He said there were no classes without teachers during the last\n\nterm but since the start of the year teachers have failed to attend classes\n\nbecause of semester exams. \n\n  Mr. Adams said corrective measures to have make-up classes at a\n\nlater date were in place and this was conveyed to the students.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Today more than 50,000 students will sit the annual Common\n\nEntrance Examinations ( CEE). \n\n  The CEE has, over the years, come under severe criticism with\n\nsome even calling for its abolition.\n One of the views advanced in the debate is that scholarship winners\n\nperform poorly in their first year of high school, because they are not\n\nsufficiently prepared. \n\n  sought the views of a number of educators.\n\nThey were asked to comment on the question:  " Are you satisfied with\n\nthe standard of the Common Entrance Exam?"  \n\n  George Abrahams, a noted teacher who has been preparing students\n\nfor the Common Entrance for many years, gave an emphatic  " No"\n\n .\n " the\n\nstandard is too low."  \n\n  " At least a half of those who are given free places are\n\nnot adequately prepared for high school, as the standard in many primary and\n\nprep schools were too low,"  he said. \n\n  In addition, Mr. Abrahams said that the exam was itself too easy,\n\nand where there was a difficult question, it was designed primarily to select\n\nthe winners of Government scholarships. \n\n  Mr. Abrahams, who tutors students at his Chesterfield Avenue home\n\nin Kingston, has 70 schools represented in his classes. \n\n  University of the West Indies professor, Errol Miller, said\n\nstudies show that the Mental Ability section of the exam does not contribute\n\nto the selection process for a free place.\n Mental Ability, he said, was in some instances a duplication of the\n\nMaths and English which are separate subject areas in the exam.\n To enhance the exam, Prof. Miller suggested that that section be\n\ndropped replaced by Science. \n\n  " in a real sense the standard\n\ndoes not matter. It ( the CEE) is an exam set to select students for high\n\nschool, not to measure educational standard."  \n\n  Marcia Stewart, principal of St. Hugh\'s High School for Girls,\n\nacknowledged deficiencies in the CEE, but nevertheless pointed out that it is\n\nperhaps the best selection method that the country has at this time.\n She explained that each academic year a number of students enter the\n\nfirst form unprepared for high school work.\n This weakness, she said, was particularly evident in English as two\n\nof the eight first form classes at the school usually concentrated on\n\nremedial classes in English. \n\n  Coleridge Barnett, principal of Wolmer\'s Boy\'s School, noted that\n\nmuch of the free place winners entering the school were in need of remedial\n\nclasses, particularly in English Language. \n\n  Hyacinth Bennett, principal of Hydel Preparatory School, was\n\nuncertain where the blame should lie, for the poor performance of free place\n\nholders.\n She suggested that a study be done to determine the deficiencies in\n\nthe system.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  THE Downtown Kingston Development Plan, being spearheaded by the\n\nKingston Restoration Company ( KRC) to restore the nation\'s capital to its\n\nformer glory, will be ready by the end of March. \n\n  In its research to devise the plan, the Strategic Planning Group\n\n( SPG) uncovered eight major social and economic issues that are of concern\n\nto the community.\n These were disclosed by Dr. Don Hanson of the SPG Tuesday night when\n\nhe presented proposals for the development to architects at the PCJ\n\nAuditorium. \n\n  Noting that the issues were of concern to all sectors of the\n\nsociety, Dr. Hanson identified security as being at the top of the list.\n " raised the topic of the\n\nimportance of existing laws and the ability and will to govern." \n\n\n\n \n " poverty is of major concern among those who have\n\nbeen fortunate enough to succeed as well as those who are suffering from the\n\ndepth of poverty that we find in inner city conditions."  \n\n  The lack of employment opportunities is also significant.\n he noted, was widespread, with\n\npresent employment statistics characterising inner city populations in\n\nKingston and other major cities across the world.\n Such factors, he said, create additional problems of pollution and\n\nsanitation, stigma and discrimination. \n\n  Dr. Hanson said the research also underlined the need for\n\nlearning opportunities, especially when it is established that annually\n\n24,000 young Jamaicans,  " those most educated, those most ambitious,\n\nthose most advantaged, emigrate to other countries permanently." \n\n\n  " whole\n\nconcept of ghettoisation"  of the city, which  " particularly\n\napplies to a ghettoised economy," one in which the community does not profit\n\nfrom the revenues of the businesses and the activities within its own\n\ndistrict."  \n\n  The Downtown Kingston Development Plan was conceptualised\n\nmid-1992 when the KRC entered into a joint venture with the Urban Development\n\nCorporation ( UDC), the Town Planning Department ( TPD), the Kingston and St.\n\nAndrew Corporation ( KSAC), the Jamaica Chamber of Commerce and the Town and\n\nCountry Planning Authority ( TCPA).\n The joint venture was created to analyse the issues of a decaying\n\ndowntown Kingston and reverse the social and economic consequence it has\n\nproduced. \n\n  It has been noted that the city, with its rich and diverse\n\nheritage, has decayed and is now  " a divided city - a city held\n\nhostage by fear and poverty."  \n\n  "\n\na plan of action structured to produce results." \n The effort will involve a broad cross-section of Kingston\'s\n\ncommunity. \n\n  The primary issues being investigated and developed into policy\n\nrecommendations are: community development and housing; economic development\n\nand tourism; land use and urban design; transportation, infrastructure and\n\npublic service, and implementation strategy. \n\n  The master plan will be structured into three five-year phases,\n\neach identifying and recommending projects, the cost and beneficial\n\nconsequences.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  TRADE Administrator Phillip Paulwell has said that Jamaica could\n\nhave its Fair Competition Act passed into law by the end of next month. \n\n \n\n  Mr. Paulwell was speaking at a forum organized by the\n\nnewly-formed Consumer Lobby Group recently. Other presenters included\n\nattorneys-at-law, Monica Ladd, Derrick McKoy and Lord Anthony Gifford. \n\n  The Trade Administrator said that the proposed legislation seeks\n\nto discourage price fixing, double-ticketing, misleading advertising and\n\nabuse of dominant market position. \n\n  The bill, he said, would not outlaw business mergers and\n\nmonopolies, but rather it sought to treat them in relation to the use of such\n\nstatus. \n\n  It also makes provision for the creation of a Fair Trading\n\nCommission, and is designed to take action against companies that misuse\n\ntheir market dominance.\n " will deal favourably with any\n\nmonopoly which operates fairly and for the common good, within the limits of\n\nthe law."  \n\n  "\n\nWhat the Act should do is to outlaw an abuse of the consumer, and go ahead\n\nand define that. But it should not say an abuse by a dominant company, as\n\nopposed to an abuse by another company."  \n\n \n\n  She said that as the bill now stands there was insufficient\n\ndefinition of  " dominant market position"  .\n Further, dominance in a market is not easy to establish as there was\n\nnot enough data available to show what was the market share of various\n\ncompanies. \n\n  Miss Ladd also expressed her objections to provisions in the law\n\nthat disallowed mergers which are potentially threatening as  " the\n\npremise that basically the bigger you are the \'badder\' you get,"  was\n\nunsatisfactory. \n\n  Some powers which the bill has given to the Minister of Commerce,\n\nshe said, should properly rest with the Commission.\n Miss Ladd added that the Commission, rather than the Minister, should\n\nbe determinant of what a  " good agreement"  was between\n\ncompanies as furnished under Section 3 of the Act. \n\n  She pointed out that there was a public misconception that the\n\nAct would lower prices.\n " it is designed to allow people\n\nto sell at whatever price they deemed fit.\n So, if someone wants to raise their prices sky high, the Act in\n\nprinciple encourages them to that on the theory that consumers won\'t buy and\n\nthey will be driven out of business."  \n\n  Lord Anthony Gifford complained that though the Commission was\n\nempowered to investigate instances of unfair competition,  " its\n\npowers to take action after it had investigated are very\n\nlimited&dotted-line;.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'e8f65f75-fcb4-4c57-8bca-aa77a787a011', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.436453+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9842079877853394, 'non_english_score': 0.015792012214660645}
{'text': 'PROPERTY insurance against natural catastrophes, such as\n\nhurricanes, earthquakes and floods, may soon be history in countries like\n\nJamaica if the high frequency of worldwide natural disasters continues. \n\n  Reinsurers, those agencies which insure insurance companies, have\n\nbeen reeling under the impact of a spate of natural disasters worldwide over\n\nthe past five years. \n\n  In 1989, Lloyds of London, one of the most prominent names\n\ninternationally in the insurance business, registered a loss of 2,06 billion\n\npounds sterling because of massive pay- outs. \n\n  Joe O\'Connell, a re-insurance intermediary from IOC Re-insurance\n\nBrokers Limited in Toronto, Canada, said that in terms of losses and natural\n\ndisasters in 1988 Hurricane Gilbert,  " sort of started it." \n\n\n\n  Gilbert, the Piper Alpha oil platform disaster in the North Sea,\n\nearthquakes in Australia and California, winter storms in Europe, Hurricane\n\nHugo and Hurricane Andrew all brought to the fore the real risks faced by\n\nre-insurers, Mr. O\'Connell said. \n\n  Nick Doak, public relations manager for Lloyds in London, told the\n\n Sunday Gleaner  that  " the re-insurance market has\n\ncontracted in the wake of windfall losses."  \n\n  Mr. Doak said last week in London the impact of climatic changes\n\ncaused by global warming was being discussed by re-insurers.\n Natural disasters have been happening in places which were thought to\n\nbe relatively safe, such as hurricanes in England. \n\n  Some re-insurers have cracked under the pressure of frequent and\n\nlarge claims.\n Withdrawals started three years ago, there has been a 40 per cent\n\nreduction in the number of re-insurers in the market compared to two years\n\nago, Mr. O\'Connell said. \n\n  Neville Henry, vice-president of the Jamaica Association of\n\nGeneral Insurance Companies ( JAGIC) said  " since 1992 we ( JAGIC)\n\nsuccumbed to the insistence of re- insurance companies to the existence of a\n\ndraconian excess." \n This is one of the steps re-insurers are taking to protect\n\nthemselves. \n\n  which is two per cent\n\non the sum insured, came into effect in Jamaica in January 1992 and is\n\nbrought into play in the event of a catastrophe.\n " any\n\nloss which falls below an amount equivalent to two per cent of the sum\n\ninsured would not be borne by the insurance company,"  Mr. Henry\n\nsaid. \n\n  Prior to Hurricane Gilbert the excess was a flat sum of\n\n$300. \n\n  Other protective measures are in the form of restricting the\n\namount of insurance being offered, Mr. Doak said. \n\n  Mr. Henry speculated that should the frequency of natural\n\ndisasters continue along its present trend more re-insurers will  "\n\ncome out of the business of catastrophe insurance."  \n\n  This would mean that many insurance companies, especially in\n\ncountries like Jamaica, could not write insurance.\n " earthquake insurance may\n\nhave to be shared,"  by the company and its client, Mr. Henry said.\n\n\n\n  The increased number of natural disasters could also affect the\n\nability of people to buy insurance as premiums would become too expensive.\n If the frequency of disasters in the Caribbean continues it may reach\n\nthe point where  " not more than about 10 per cent of the population\n\nwould have insurance,"  Mr. O\'Connell said. \n\n  Mr. Doak, however, thinks that the re-insurance industry is just\n\nexperiencing one of its usual cycles of high claims which it has from time to\n\ntime. \n\n  Prior to these disasters the insurance market was doing so well\n\nthat everybody was rushing in.\n " increased competition drove down\n\ninsurance rates,"  Mr. O\'Connell said.\n\n\n, he said. \n\n  In fact, Mr. O\'Connell said it is this very competition that\n\nallowed regions like the Caribbean to be able to get full insurance coverage.\n\n\n\n  Jamaica\'s recent brush with an earthquake got many people\n\nthinking of the worth of their home.\n So much so that Mr. Henry said on the very evening after the\n\nearthquake people came in to find out about insurance coverage. \n\n  An estimated\n\n$5 million of damage to residential properties reported to the Office of\n\nDisaster Preparedness are from persons who have no insurance coverage on\n\ntheir property. \n\n  At NEM, Mr. Henry said, since the earthquake there appears to\n\nhave been a  " significant increase in applications for insurance."\n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  A CRACKDOWN on unlicenced buses in the Corporate Area could leave\n\nthousands of commuters stranded without public transportation starting\n\ntomorrow. \n\n  The Transport Authority, Government\'s public transport monitoring\n\nagency, plans to seize buses belonging to owners who failed to renew\n\noperating licences and pay franchise fees by the January 31 deadline. \n\n  Members of the newly formed National Transportation Co-operative\n\nSociety Ltd. ( NTC), who reportedly own the majority of the buses, could be\n\nthe hardest hit. \n\n  Through late Thursday afternoon, the TA received 183 applications\n\nfor licences, which includes franchise fee payments, from operators in the\n\nKingston Metropolitan Region ( KMR).\n But according to the Government agency, none of the applications came\n\nfrom the NTC, which claims to have over 480 of the estimated 531 Corporate\n\nArea bus owners as members.\n The KMR, which is served by 835 buses providing 22,627 seats to\n\ntransport well over 500,000 commuters each day, is already hampered by a\n\nshortage of available seats. \n\n  Beginning tomorrow, the TA plans to remove unlicenced buses from\n\nthe road. \n\n \n " We will start seizing buses for non-payment of franchise fees as of\n\nnext week,"  newly appointed TA managing director Commander John\n\nMcFarlane said Thursday. \n\n  When we asked if the NTC was aware that the deadline had passed,\n\nhe replied: \n\n  " We have advised the Co-operative that the grace period has\n\nexpired."  \n\n  The franchise fee for KMR buses is\n\n$210 per seat:\n\n$200 per seat for Portmore buses. \n\n  But the NTC on Friday denied that all of its members had failed\n\nto file licence applications and paid franchise fees before the deadline.\n\n\n\n \n said NTC general manager\n\nTony Smith. \n " Applications are being processed as it relates to the renewal of\n\nfranchise fees as it applies to members."  \n\n  Sunday\n\nGleaner  with a list of operators who had submitted applications to the\n\nNTC and the TA.\n He acknowledged that NTC members were aware of the January 31\n\ndeadline. \n\n  did not receive the information.\n The NTC claims to have issued several reminders to members, including\n\na letter dated January 25, 1993, which stated:  " Franchise fees are\n\nnow due"  and  " the deadline for payment is January 31,\n\n1993."  \n\n  The NTC made special arrangements to accommodate tardy bus owners\n\nby extending office hours to January 30 and 31.\n But according to the TA, no applications came in from NTC members\n\nthrough Thursday. \n\n  In recent weeks the TA has seized over 160 buses for various\n\nviolations, including operators not issuing tickets and failure to complete\n\nroutes.\n\n\n  According to Mr. Smith, many of the bus owners could not afford\n\nto pay franchise fees before the deadline.\n However, he said the TA was entitled to carry out its duty under law.\n\n\n\n \n " In light of the economic strain some operators find it difficult to\n\npay,"  he said. \n " But if our members fall out of line the penalties are there."\n\n \n\n  NTC members file licence renewal application through the NTC,\n\nwith fee payments made out to the NTC and submitted to the Co-operative\'s\n\naccount.\n Payment also includes a\n\n$500 processing fee for each application.\n transfering\n\n  transferring   it to the TA, along with the fees. \n\n  The NTC was established late last year, following the\n\nGovernment\'s expressed dissatisfaction with the package holder system.\n A co-operative was approved by the Government to bring together over\n\n800 bus operators.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  THE disappearance of a white 1991 Toyota Starlet motorcar owned\n\nby Circular Car Rentals of Ocho Rios, from the Rockfort Police Station, is\n\nshrouded in mystery. \n\n  The motorcar which is said to be valued in the region of\n\n$500,000, was stolen from a client at River Sea Inn in the tourist resort\n\narea at 3 a.m., recovered at 4 p.m., taken to the Rockfort Police

{'text': 'Financial institutions should consider a secondary mortgage\n\nmarket - official  \n\n  At a recent conference of the Caribbean Association of Housing\n\nFinance Institutions ( CASHFI) in Kingston, James Carr, vice president in\n\ncharge of housing policy research at Fannie Mae, Washington D.C., had some\n\nincisive comments on the possibilities for the development of a secondary\n\nmortgage market in the Caribbean. \n\n  The following summarizes some of the general issues that he\n\nsuggests should be considered:- \n\n  &dot; The presence of some common basis or coordination of\n\neconomic and financial policies is a necessary pre-condition for the\n\ndevelopment of a secondary market, especially if it is to flourish and if\n\nfinancial securities are to follow more easily across national boundaries.\n\n\n\n  &dot; There has been a widely divergent economic structure and\n\nperformance across the Caribbean countries.\n Some have strong economies and others have weak and very unstable\n\neconomies.\n This will make pricing of financial securities based on mortgages in\n\nthese countries very difficult.\n There is also the problem of co-ordination of foreign exchange rates\n\nto varying degrees, the extent to which these are subsidised or capitalized\n\ninto the price of financial securities and will have to be investigated\n\nbefore a common secondary market can be developed. \n\n  &dot; The institutional structures of the financial systems in\n\nthese countries are also different.\n Some of the countries like Trinidad and Tobago have large banks that\n\ndominate the banking system.\n These banks serve as the secondary market and function in a manner\n\nthat can enhance the development of their primary market.\n Some of the other countries have fragmented banking structures and\n\nmany may require some consolidation of such institutions to be competitive\n\nwith strong and big banks from other countries. \n\n  &dot; The secondary markets function to redress the regional\n\nimbalance in spatial allocation of mortgage credit.\n This system works as long as there are capital-rich and capital-poor\n\nregions.\n In the case of Caribbean countries, most of the countries have such\n\nsimilar growth profiles that it is not clear which of the countries want to\n\nbe exporters of capital as opposed to importers of capital.\n If all, ( not most countries) want to be importers, a question is\n\nraised as to where the capital will come from. \n\n  &dot; The secondary market has also evolved to take advantage of\n\nthe scale of economies directly.\n An integrated banking system is needed to take advantage of such\n\neconomies of scale.\n The securities in the US are fairly complex and the advent of the\n\nSavings and Loans network allows easy evaluation of underwriting practices\n\nacross a wide range of communities in the US.\n This makes it relatively easy to determine the characteristics of\n\nmortgage pools, including payoff, characteristics that were put together from\n\nactivities of the primary lenders all across the country.\n The underwriting procedures might vary widely across Caribbean\n\ncountries, and it is not clear whether risk characteristics of mortgage loans\n\nin these countries can be easily compared and pooled as they are in the US.\n\n\n\n  &dot; The issue of credit quality is very important for\n\nsecuritization of loans in the secondary market.\n Part of standardizing credit quality is standardizing collateral\n\nquality.\n In the US, the FHA played a huge role to ensure that not only\n\nunderwriting rules are standardized, but also construction standards. \n\n  There is a need to ensure that a system is in place to assess the\n\ncollateral quality of houses in these countries before prompting secondary\n\nmarkets. \n\n  &dot; One feature of the US secondary market system that is worth\n\nlooking at for possible adaptation in the Caribbean is the extent to which\n\ngeographic diversification of risk could be achieved.\n There is also a need for some vehicle to hold mortgages in order to\n\npump liquidity into the system. \n\n  &dot; There must be institutions either private or public willing\n\nto accept a lot of credit risk for the secondary market to work.\n This is necessary, within the context of a secondary market, because\n\none is managing risk from afar.\n Under such circumstances, it is very difficult to figure risk\n\naccurately.\n In the US, the government accepted this burden with the establishment\n\nof federally-insured mortgages.\n The willingness of the Federal government to accept the default risk\n\nallowed the market to develop and flourish.\n Within the Caribbean countries, there must be an institution either\n\nprivate or public that is willing to bear the default risk.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n  So said Jamaica\'s ambassador to the United States, economist Dr.\n\nRichard Bernal, in an exclusive interview with the Jamaica Herald.\n This came only days after the announcement was made of an agreement\n\namong the United States, Canada and Mexico to form the world\'s largest\n\ntrading bloc. \n\n  The three countries, with a population between them of over 360\n\nmillion people are to form the North American Free Trade Association (\n\nNAFTA). \n\n  " like a voice crying\n\nin the wilderness"  .\n For more than a year he has been advocating the need for the private\n\nsector, and Jamaica in general, to prepare themselves for the imminent\n\neventuality of this free trade arrangement coming into being. \n\n  Externally, he has testified to both the United States Congress\n\nand the International Trade Commission regarding the impact of the free trade\n\narrangement on Jamaica and the region as a whole. \n\n  Asked to comment on the impact the free trade arrangement would\n\nhave on the Jamaican economy, Dr. Bernal said   " NAFTA should come\n\ninto being during the latter half of next year ( 1993).\n When this happens Mexico will have more favourable market access to\n\nthe United States.\n We therefore have to be active in lobbying the three countries\n\ninvolved, to ensure that when NAFTA comes into place, despite the presence of\n\nanything that superseded the CBI ( Caribbean Basin Initiative) provision that\n\nwe should be given parity with Mexico.\n In other words, if quotas on apparels from Mexico under NAFTA are\n\nremoved, then those under the CBI should also be removed." He\n\nindicated that there should be a level playing field on which all the\n\ncountries in the hemisphere are operating on the same basis. \n\n  Commenting on the perception of CBI and Enterprise for the\n\nAmericas Initiative being seen as economic and political handouts vis-a-vis\n\nNAFTA\'S interpretation as being a real and economic relationship, ambassador\n\nBernal said,   " If the CBI is intended to create Caribbean\n\ndevelopment so as to create politically safe neighbours then if NAFTA\n\nsupersedes it and erodes the benefits of the CBI then that objective is not\n\ngoing to be attained.\n\n  So whether for economic or political reasons, or for both, the\n\nUS has an interest in ensuring that Caribbean development does not suffer any\n\nadverse implications from NAFTA.\n In other words US$5 billion exports to the CBI might not be a major\n\nmarket for the US but  it\'s an area in which exports\n\nhave grown area in which the US has security and political interest which\n\ncould be served by stable economic and political development.\n\n  What level of resistance does he expect inside the US to NAFTA,\n\nparticularly in view of this being an election year?\n Dr. Bernal said it was difficult to judge, particularly at this time\n\nwhen over 100 new members of Congress are to be voted into office this year.\n It would take some effort by the Bush Administration to push the\n\nlegislation through to its finality, given the degree of protection\n\nprospective congressmen seek for their constituencies. \n\n  He felt that President Bush would seek however to incorporate\n\nNAFTA as part of his re-election economic programme for the coming November\n\n   presidential   election.  </l>\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n " Quality education begins with quality teachers.\n However, quality teachers do not come any more cheaply than quality\n\ndoctors, business managers or lawyers."\n\n  This was the view expressed Monday night by Mr. Ray Howell as he\n\nwas installed as the new President of the Jamaica Teachers Association.\n Mr. Howell, said that the underpaying of teachers in the public\n\nservice had resulted in over 850 vacancies in secondary, high and technical\n\nschools.\n\n\n  Mr. Howell, who replaced Mrs. Rosemarie Vernon as JTA President,\n\nmade a commitment to  " speak out on issues that affect teachers and\n\neducation in general"  as he represented the  " frustrations\n\nand aspirations of 18,000 teachers." \n He spoke at length about the economic problems in the education\n\nsystem and said that education was a  " long term investment requiring\n\nyears of continuous input in order to get the desired result."  \n\n \n\nteachers\'  ability to promote quality education.\n He said these included overcrowded classrooms, poor working\n\nconditions and dilapidated buildings. \n\n  School building contracts being given to persons who know\n\nnothing about construction  " is a serious problem for the teaching\n\nlearning environment,"  he said. \n\n  Mr. Howell said that the government\'s expenditure on education\n\nwas less than it was in 1974 as the money that should be used to educate the\n\nnation is being used to pay external debts.\n " redirect the over\n\n$428 million collected in 1991 to 92 for Educational Tax to its original\n\npurpose."  \n\n  The outgoing President, Mrs. Vernon, made a similar statement\n\nwhen she asked that the Ministry of Education take the theme of the\n\nconference \'Education - the Most Valuable Investment\' as a national theme.\n\n\n\n  She bemoaned the economic status of the teachers and said the\n\nneglect of education is being reflected in the high level of poverty in the\n\nnation.\n Mrs. Vernon said that studies have proven that educated people are\n\nmore productive workers and responsible citizens. \n\n  The keynote speaker at the opening of the conference was the\n\nChief Executive Officer of Alcan, Dr. Keith Panton who said  " it is\n\ncrucial that any and every country must consider investment in its people if\n\nit is to progress, if it is to exist."  \n\n  The Minister of Education Mr. Burchell Whiteman will be address\n\nthe teachers today at the final session of the three day conference. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  Homicide detectives around the island are still searching for\n\nclues which will assist them in identifying 19 bodies found in the Corporate\n\nArea and in some rural parishes since the start of this year.\n Thirteen of those killed were men, three women and three children.\n Signs of violence were seen on most of the bodies of the victims.\n\n\n\n  Detectives say the state of decomposition in which some of the\n\nbodies were found has made the police work harder in coming up with clues to\n\nidentify them. \n\n  Nine of the unidentified bodies were found in the Corporate Area\n\nbetween February and July.\n\n\n  Data released by the Homicide Division show that dead bodies\n\nstarted turning up in the Corporate Area in February when the body of a dark\n\nmale with wounds behind the left ear was found washed ashore behind the car\n\npark at the Bank of Jamaica building in Downtown Kingston. \n\n  Two weeks later the charred remains of another body was found in\n\nan abandoned building at the intersection on Hannah Street and Oxford Street\n\nin the crime prone West Kingston.\n This was followed by what appeared to be a double murder of a couple\n\nwhose bodies were found in a eight-foot pit in Jones Town on March 4. \n\n  Between March 19-30 three bodies were found in Port Royal,\n\nChurch Street and Coopers Hill.\n In the Coopers Hill case the body was burnt, the hands and feet were\n\nbound with electric wire and there was a mask over the face.\n The last victim was that of a male with burns all over which was\n\nfound along the Causeway on July 3. \n\n  On January 1 the partially decomposed body of an infant was\n\nfound in a pit latrine at Charles Town in Windsor Heights, St. Ann. \n\n  In February in Cho Cho Spring district in St. Mary, the\n\npartially decomposed body of a woman was found.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'f4faa123-ecb4-4aa2-bc9b-5480b0c194d9', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.439303+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9741138219833374, 'non_english_score': 0.025886178016662598}
{'text': 'An evening of powerful African history at the Cultural Training\n\nCentre, on Monday, almost ended in a fracas when the guest speaker mentioned\n\nthat whites had come out of Africa. \n\n  " African Continuity in the\n\n21st Century"  with particular interest in the relationship between\n\nGarvey and the Lion of Judah.\n The chairman was Dr. Julius Garvey, son of the late national hero and\n\nguest speaker was Professor James Small, lecturer in the Department of Black\n\nStudies, City College of New York. \n\n  Panellists included Nigerian High Commissioner, Professor Emannuel\n\nOgochukwu; Dr. Rupert Lewis, Reader in Political Thought, University of the\n\nWest Indies; Andrea Williams, announcer from Irie FM, and Garth White,\n\nresearcher at the Afro Caribbean Institute of Jamaica. \n\n  After many of the preliminaries and discussions about the wealth\n\nof African Literature and descriptions of the roots of black culture, the\n\nmood of the evening soured. \n\n  During the question and answer session, a member of the audience,\n\none of a group of persons, apparently belonging to the Black Muslim group,\n\nasked Professor Small where his locks were and his reason for cutting them.\n\n\n\n  When Mr. Small tried to avoid the question, saying that he had\n\nalready explained this and that it could be discussed elsewhere, the young\n\nman, who sported locks, became abusive.\n Persons in the audience were openly upset with the young man\'s\n\nattitude.\n What threatened to become open hostility from several sides was\n\naverted by Rupert  quick action in discreetly taking the\n\nmicrophone from Mr. Small. \n\n  The whole discussion came to a virtual chaotic standstill,\n\nhowever, when Professor Small made a remark about whites coming out of Africa\n\n\ndemanded Mutabaruka ( a musician and dub poet) in disbelief. \n\n  In his attempts to explain, the speaker was shouted down, even as\n\nhe picked up a book to demonstrate a point.\n As he made each point, the greater portion of the audience sided with\n\nhim by applause, whereupon he asked them to desist as he was not in a war.\n\n\n\n  " mutation"\n\n , the Nigerian High Commissioner took the microphone to assist the\n\nguest speaker.\n " Shut up! Get\n\nout of here! You don\'t know what you\'re talking about!"  \n\n  An older Rastafarian shook his finger under the nose of one the\n\nyoung men shouting these remarks. \n\n  As the situation worsened, at least three persons went to the\n\nmicrophone to try and quell the rude remarks that were hurtling through the\n\nair.\n " We\'re playing into the hands\n\nof the media, over and over again." \n\n\n  Heated arguments began to spring up from several ends of the\n\nroom.\n As the poor behaviour continued, Rupert Lewis repeatedly called for\n\nthe audience to  " respect ourselves"  and to quiet\n\nthemselves.\n\n\nhe emphasized.\n " We can\'t mash up a discussion on\n\nfoolishness." \n He called on Mutabaruka to play some music as a panacea, but\n\nMutabaruka\'s answer was  " a still don\'t get mi question answer."\n\n \n\n  The guest speaker, Prof. Small, came back to the microphone and\n\nasked to be allowed to deal with the difficulty as, he said, he was the cause\n\nof it. \n\n  The evening ended with the final remarks by Dr. Garvey who stated\n\nthat the evening was illustrative of the problems African communities faced\n\nin coming together. \n\n  " Animals do not have choices... a dog\n\nmust behave in a certain way."  \n\n  He ended by remarking that Garvey thought it was important to\n\nteach men  " the higher values of civilisation"  .\n " the mantle and the vision of Marcus Garvey has\n\nbeen passed to us - the next generation."  \n\n  he said.\n Earlier in the programme, Dr. Julius Garvey mentioned the need to\n\nembrace the Rastafarian community, in moving towards something of a classless\n\nsociety.\n He said there was a need for mutual respect and understanding and\n\nbetween Rastafarians and Garveyites. \n\n  The Nigerian High Commissioner brought greetings from Africa and\n\nexpressed his surprise at the relatively small gathering present.\n In Lagos, he said, no hall could hold those interested in such a\n\ndiscussion.\n He noted, however, the increase over the last anniversary and\n\nremarked that it indicated the growing awareness of the  " greatness\n\nof the man."  \n\n  " a most wonderful human being, a great\n\nJamaican... a great African,"  who had a  " tremendous\n\ninfluence in Nigeria." \n He ended by pledging the assistance of the High Commission in any\n\neffort by Jamaica to project Marcus Garvey, in whom he said  " our\n\nsolution lies"  . \n\n  " Ancient Egypt and\n\nEthiopia,"  began by greeting the audience in an ancient Egyptian\n\nLanguage.\n His presentation, frequently punctuated with strong applause and\n\nshouts of  " Jah! Rastafari!"  ranged from a defense of \n\n writings to the need for all\n\nthose of African descent to try and obtain, search, question and study the\n\nhistory and especially the writings of ancient African civilisations. \n\n  He highlighted certain aspects of African Literature which he\n\nsaid, should be scrutinized, examined, understood, taken apart, in schools\n\nand universities.\n Their fundamental principles, he said, should be mimicked.\n He spoke with pride of the literature of Africa.\n\n\n  of\n\nthis literature had been packed away in crates, boxes, museums all over the\n\nworld, much of it gathered under the auspices of the United    Nations   , when  " the blackness,    Africanness   "  of it was recognised.\n\n\n\n  But he extolled Ghana and Nigeria for making strides in including\n\nsome of    this   literature, in their educational\n\nsystem. \n\n  He said he had discovered, out of a meeting with the Ministry of\n\nEducation, that Jamaica was  " also restructuring its education system\n\nto include the type of literature"  he was speaking of. \n\n  After his presentation, the audience enjoyed an intermission of\n\nmusic provided by Mutabaruka during which they sought autographs of and\n\nintroduction to the speaker and Dr. Garvey.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  Everyday, between 80 and 90 teenagers, some of whom just walk in\n\noff the street, give visitors to the LEAP Centre in downtown Kingston an\n\ninsight into the great possibilities of the human spirit. \n\n  Working under the guidance of the Centre, these teenagers are\n\nturning out work in shoe-making and repair, ceramics, garment making and art\n\nand craft, surpassing the quality of many commercial establishments and\n\ncreating a demand that they cannot yet fill. \n\n  The Learning for Earning Activity Programme ( LEAP) Centre was\n\nestablished by government in 1986 to provide an education that would help\n\ncorrect the learning problems of \'special children\' and enable them to\n\nre-enter the normal school system.\n It is also geared at providing vocational education to equip them\n\nwith marketable skills, as well as to give them real life experience in\n\nhandling an income. \n\n  Since then, the Centre, located at Duke Street in downtown\n\nKingston, has been laying the foundation for street children, slow learners\n\nand mentally retarded children - 126 are now enrolled - to lead useful,\n\nproductive lives. \n\n  Co-ordinator of the Centre, Lenworth Black says LEAP has been a\n\nsuccess story, with the work done by the youngsters winning frequent awards\n\nand commendations at major exhibitions. \n\n  Among its most recent credits were the top prize in the craft\n\ncategory at the Jamaica Manufacturers Association/Jamaica Exporters\n\nAssociation Exposition at the National Arena and the July 18-19 Craft Fair at\n\nDevon House. \n\n  Sale of the items provide a source of income for the students who\n\nare given guidance in money management and encouragement in the habit of\n\nsaving.\n\n\n  The Government provides a stipend of\n\n$37,50 a week to each student, in addition to meals, clothes, and\n\naccommodation for the mix of residential and non-residential students. \n\n  Noting that some of the students are orphans, the Coordinator\n\nVeda Pascoe, is full of praise for those parents who take an active interest\n\nin their children\'s progress.\n To promote such interaction, parenting workshops and open days are\n\nheld. \n\n  However, she is sharply critical of parents who abandoned or\n\nneglect their children who are in the programme, but turn up to claim them as\n\nsoon as they hear that these children have bank accounts.\n She says they then abandon the children as soon as the bank accounts\n\nare exhausted. \n\n  She said the centre was pushing for protective legislation to\n\nguard against such abuse and exploitation of children. \n\n\n  Mrs. Pascoe says that among the most significant developments is\n\nthe Centre\'s organisation of an apprenticeship programme for the students and\n\nprivate sector companies.\n Such programmes, she explains, in addition to giving the students the\n\npractical hands-on experience, helped to ease them into the working\n\nenvironment before they became fully employed. \n\n  LEAP maintains a three-month liaison with the employer while the\n\nstudents are apprentices, to deal with possible problems.\n\n\n  The next major item on the LEAP agenda, Mrs Pascoe says, is a\n\nplan to venture into the repair of small appliances.\n She noted that there is a large market in that area and individuals\n\ntrained in such skills are always in high demand. \n\n  Future plans also include expanding the Centre into the rural\n\nareas, Mrs Pascoe says, to serve those areas which were neglected in terms of\n\nservices for such children. \n\n  This move, however, will depend on increased funding from\n\nnon-governmental sources to implement the contributions from the Friends of\n\nLEAP and some private sector contributors, she emphasises. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n  THE Government\'s seaport security programme is so effective that\n\ndrug smugglers have now shifted their attention to the airports.\n\n\n  The amount of drugs seized both in Jamaica and the United States\n\nhad been declining since 1986 but it went up again last year, though only 30%\n\nwas discovered at seaports. \n\n  This was revealed yesterday by the Parliamentary Secretary in the\n\nMinistry of Production, Mining and Commerce, Horace Dalley, as he opened a\n\ncourse for port security officers at the Finance and Accounts College of\n\nTraining ( FACT). \n\n  " Now that the smugglers have shifted their attention to\n\nthe airports, we have been putting more emphasis on security work there,\n\nhence, one of the key objectives of this course is update you on the most\n\neffective techniques for detecting drugs in the air freight,"  Mr.\n\nDalley told the participants. \n\n  Giving a breakdown of the amount of drugs detected at the ports\n\nsince 1986, he disclosed that during that year 96,000 pounds of ganja was\n\ndiscovered.\n In 1987 the figure went down to 51,000 pounds and in 1988 to 38,000\n\npounds.\n The amount of ganja discovered in 1989 was even less and by 1990 it\n\nhad reached a low of 13,000.\n Last year, however, it climbed to 21,000 pounds, 70% of which was\n\nconsigned to air freight. \n\n  " We cannot let up in our war against drug trafficking,\n\nand we will fight it on every front,"  he vowed. \n\n  He said the Government could not allow its over US$1.1 billion\n\ntrade with the United States to be threatened because of criminal elements.\n It made very little sense for workers and managers to put out their\n\nbest, only to have the country\'s exports jeopardized because of narcotics\n\ntrafficking.\n He said the only way the poor could get better medical care and\n\neducational facilities was for the country to earn more foreign exchange.\n This could not be done if narcotics were frequently found in export\n\nshipments. \n\n  Mr. Dalley said government recognised that the integrity of\n\nJamaica\'s exports was vital and thus took the decision to institute the now\n\nover 700-strong port security officer corps, which had made a significant\n\nimpact in discouraging drug shipments. \n\n  He said although the press had not given it much attention, the\n\nport security programme was an outstanding success.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id':

{'text': 'LATE last night police were hot on the trail of gunmen who\n\nbrutally shot dead four members of a family in Kingston\'s Arnett Gardens,\n\ninformed sources said. \n\n  At least one suspect was reportedly being interrogated up to press\n\ntime and police were following other leads. \n\n  The gangland style execution of Stanford Spence, his two sons Paul\n\nand Jervis and one of the son\'s girlfriends took place just after midnight in\n\nthe " Mexico" and " Angola" areas. \n\n  In other developments, the area\'s political representatives were\n\nhuddling on how to restore calm after the brutal massacre, and the Police\n\nHigh Command reported that the Prime Minister  " had been briefed"\n\n . \n\n  All the victims were shot in the head and chest with Uzi\n\nsubmachine guns.\n The girlfriend, Patricia Campbell, was killed with a bullet right\n\nthrough the ears. \n\n  A fourth person, Jervis\'s girlfriend Dawn Clarke, has been\n\nadmitted to hospital with a bullet in the chest.\n\n\n  Witnesses said four gunmen had marched up to Jervis\'s house at\n\nabout 2 a.m., kicked off the back door and opened fire, killing him on the\n\nspot.\n\n\n  The four then went to " Mexico", thirty minutes away, and\n\nmurdered Paul, 26; Patricia, 26 and Stanford Spence, a 56-year-old porter.\n\n\n  Investigators yesterday were linking the murders to the killing\n\nby police last Saturday of escaped gangster Radcliffe Rowe, the notorious\n\ngunman who had been awaiting trial for several murders. \n\n  are that the\n\nSpences were accused of giving the police information on the whereabouts of\n\nescaped gangster, who was killed by the police last Saturday.\n\n\n  Member of Parliament for the area, Bobby Jones, and People\'s\n\nNational Party ( PNP) General Secretary, Dr Peter Philips, visited Arnett\n\nGardens yesterday morning. \n\n  Dr Philips later told journalists on the scene that Prime\n\nMinister P.J. Patterson had been briefed on the incident. \n\n  " shocked\n\nand horrified"  at the murders. ?\n " The Party condemns this act of terrorism and urges the\n\ncommunity, in the face of this dastardly assault, to unite in their efforts\n\nto fight this evil... Members of the community must give full co-operation to\n\nthe police in their efforts to apprehend the killers, there can be no\n\nsurrender to forces seeking to spread terror and mayhem,"  the\n\nrelease said. \n\n  National Security and Justice Minister, K.D. Knight, called a\n\nmeeting with political representatives in and around the area  " to\n\nsee how best they could combine their influence to restore calm in the area."\n\n\n\n\n  However, Jamaica Labour Party Spokesman on National Security,\n\nNeville Lewis, called for a meeting of interested parties and relevant\n\nagencies to begin to deal with the serious problem of crime.\n He implied that the kinds of measures implemented in JLP areas when\n\nthere were outbreaks of criminal activity, were not similarly applied when\n\nthere were outbreaks of crime in PNP areas.\n " We cannot continue to deal with crime on a political\n\nbasis,"  Mr. Lewis said.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  The Bank of Jamaica says the country\'s balance of payments\n\nsituation is not as bad as may appear and reflect particular types of\n\ntransaction made during the year. \n\n  The BOJ said there has been a net inflow of capital in the first\n\nfour months of the year compared to a net outflow last year and that the\n\ncountry\'s foreign reserves have been increased by US$143 million compared\n\nwith the net addition for the same period ( January to April) last year. \n\n  In a statement, the central bank said there have been many recent\n\nreports in the Press regarding the outcome of the Balance of Trade and\n\nseveral eminent economists have sought to draw conclusions from the Balance\n\nof Trade figures and have expressed concern as to the meaning of these\n\nfigures for the economy. \n\n  The Jamaica Herald, using official government statistics reported\n\nlast week a worsening balance of trade situation when the first four months\n\nof this year were compared to those of last year.\n The report noted that a major factor in the reduced export receipts\n\nwas bauxite/alumina sales. \n\n  In its statement issued Wednesday, the Bank of Jamaica said it is\n\nwell known that it is the total flow of income and expenditure between\n\nJamaica and the rest of the world which matters, when balance of trade\n\nfigures are being discussed, not just the trade in goods. \n\n  The bank set out the figures for January to April 1992, compared\n\nto the same period last year, as follows:  \n\n  The BOJ said the above table shows that the deviations between\n\n1992 and 1991 are not significant.\n The bank said also that the decline in capital imports in 1992 is due\n\nto the inclusion in the 1991 figures of the US$65 million for the two ?\n\naircraft. \n\n  " As stated before, the trade balance\n\nby itself does not tell the whole story of the external accounts.\n When Tourism Receipts and other Non- Goods Flows are taken into\n\naccount, the Current Account shows a positive balance of US$61.8 million for\n\nJanuary to April 1992 compared to US$29.5 million for January to April\n\n1991.\n\n  " As regards the Capital Account, it is important to point out\n\nthat the Government borrowed long term US$7 million less in the 1992 period\n\nthan in the 1991 period and paid back US$40 million in respect of Government\n\nGuaranteed and Official Short-term Debt.\n But it is in the area of Private Capital Flows where there has been\n\na dramatic turn-around.\n Instead of an outflow of US$76.0 million in January to April 1991,\n\nthere has been a net inflow of US$56.3 million in January to April 1992.\n\n  " The result of combining the Capital Account and the Current\n\nAccount is that there has been a net addition to our foreign reserves of\n\nUS$143.1 million in January to April 1992 compared with a net addition of\n\nUS$35.7 million in January to April 1991.\n It is difficult to understand how in the light of these figures\n\nanyone could say that there had been a deterioration in the External Accounts\n\nin the 1992 period."\n\n  The BOJ said it would be seen from the above table that there\n\nwas a slight increase of US$11 million in the deficit on Trade account. \n\n  " However, there is much hidden in this number.\n Economists must examine the composition of exports and imports and\n\nhad they done so in this case, they would have found the 1991 figures were\n\nunduly influenced by the way in which the sale and lease back of the two Air\n\nJamaica ? aircraft were treated.\n Under international accounting conventions, in these transactions,\n\nthe sale of the two planes were treated as exports valued at\n\n$65 million whilst the lease back is treated as an import at the same figure.\n But in macro economic terms, nothing has changed except the\n\nownership of the planes.\n Air Jamaica operated these A 300 planes before the transaction and\n\ncontinues to do so afterwards.\n When this adjustment is made, the comparison between 1991 and 1992\n\nlooks quite different"  :   \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Prime Minister P.J. Patterson says he is not prepared to have\n\nthe health of communities put at risk because persons are not performing\n\ntheir duties properly. \n\n  He has urged residents of typhoid hit Westmoreland to practice\n\nproper hygiene and not to do anything that would contaminate their water\n\nsupply. \n\n  Mr. Patterson was speaking on Tuesday during a tour of the\n\naffected communities.\n He was accompanied by Health Minister, Easton Douglas, Minister of\n\nState in the Ministry of Public Utilities, Transport and Energy, Bobby Jones,\n\nand officials from the National Water Commission ( NWC). \n\n  The Prime Minister announced that US$1.6 million had been\n\nidentified to undertake major corrective and preventative work on Roaring\n\nRiver water supply system. \n\n  The Roaring River Project, which is funded by the United Nations\n\nDevelopment Programme ( UNDP), the United States Agency for International\n\nDevelopment ( USAID), and the Government of Jamaica, will be carried out in\n\nthree phases. \n\n  Work will include the safeguarding of pipelines that lead from\n\nRoaring River into the communities.\n This is to ensure that there is no breaking of the lines so that\n\nonce the water is treated, it is safe and not subjected to further\n\ncontamination. \n\n  The pipes will also be lifted to prevent breakage and the\n\nresulting contamination of water when debris filters in. \n\n  Steps will be taken to ensure that the treatment of water is\n\nadequate and reliable.\n In addition to this, Mr. Patterson announced that he had given\n\ninstructions that capable persons should be put in charge of the water plant.\n\n\n\n  The Prime Minister announced that allocations had been made to\n\nhave 1,000 pit latrines built.\n These will be subjected to conditions which will prevent seepage\n\ninto the underground water sources.\n\n\n  He highlighted the need for the relevant agencies to work\n\ntogether in solving the problem.\n To this end, the Ministry of Health, the National Water Commission\n\nand the Jamaica Attractions Development Company will be collaborating on the\n\nRoaring River Project. \n\n  He appealed to the residents of the communities to play their\n\npart by maintaining proper hygienic standards, and by not doing anything to\n\ncontaminate the water supply.\n He asked them to co-operate with the health educators and community\n\nhealth aides who were working in the communities. \n\n  He assured the residents that the plans to develop Roaring River\n\ninto a tourism theme park would not be abandoned.\n However, typhoid outbreak would have to be brought under control to\n\navoid putting the project at risk. \n\n  After touring Roaring River, the Prime Minister visited the\n\nSavanna-la-mar General Hospital where he visited some of the patients,\n\nincluding the confirmed victims of the typhoid outbreak, and thanked the\n\nhealth officials and personnel for working diligently in bringing the disease\n\nunder control. \n\n  Mr. Patterson\'s tour of the affected areas followed one by the\n\nopposition Jamaica Labour Party last week.\n A statement issued by the JLP after the tour had made a number of\n\nsuggestions including a government funded programme to build safe pit\n\nlatrines.  \n\n\n\n \n\n$M fraud scam targets Jamaican businessmen  \n\n  A NIGERIAN fraud ring which last year tried to fleece Jamaican\n\nbusinessmen of millions of dollars, has surfaced again. \n\n  According to the Nigerian diplomat Muhammadu Yumusa, the scam\n\nresulted in at least one known Jamaican businessman co-operating with the\n\ntricksters and he was robbed of\n\n$5 million. \n\n  The latest attempt occurred last week when a prominent\n\nKingston-based businessman received a letter from one Lawrence Obiora\n\ninviting him to assist in the transfer of millions of dollars from the\n\nFederal Ministry of Aviation in Nigeria. \n\n  Purporting to be a member of the " Tenders Committee", Obiora in\n\nhis letter said:  " I have been specifically mandated to arrange with\n\na foreign firm for a possible transfer of funds being an over estimated sum\n\nresulting from various contracts executed by Alpen Group Snamproggeti and\n\nother foreign firms from my Ministry in 1984."  \n\n  According to Obiora, the contracts involved the construction of\n\nthe Abuja International airport and control tower at a cost of US$450 million\n\n- - US$250 million for the construction of runways and landing facilities,\n\nUS$90 million for the purchase of satellite equipment, and US$50 million for\n\nmaintenance. \n\n  The businessman was told that the value of these contracts were\n\ninflated to the tune of US$26.6 million, 25 percent of which would be turned\n\nover to him if he assisted in transferring it out of the country.\n Further, he was assured that all the mechanism for the transfer had\n\nbeen arranged with officials in the Nigerian Ministry of Finance and the\n\nCentral bank to facilitate the remittance to his account within 21 working\n\ndays. \n\n  In order to access the funds the businessman would need to send\n\ntwo copies of a blank letter heading of the beneficiary signed and stamped,\n\ntwo copies of proforma invoice signed and stamped, and the name of his bank\n\nplus telex and fax numbers.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'ac7e96ee-6eef-4bc9-ae58-6067f8e63cc5', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.442057+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9773803353309631, 'non_english_score': 0.022619664669036865}
{'text': 'UWI students to wait three more months for news on fee hike\n\n \n\n  Students attending the University of the West Indies ( UWI) will\n\nhave to wait for nearly another three months before knowing what percentage\n\nof the economic cost of their education they will have to pay, as a special\n\nmeeting of the University Council held on Tuesday deferred taking action on\n\nthe matter until the annual meeting of the Council on April 16, 1993. \n\n  This was disclosed yesterday by the Joint Guild of Undergraduates\n\nof the UWI at a press conference held at the  Union on the\n\nMona Campus.\n The press conference was held to update the media on the proposed\n\ntuition fee increases, and the Joint Guild was represented by the guild\n\npresidents of the Mona, St Augustine and Cave Hill Campuses. \n\n  President of the Mona Guild of Undergraduates, Derrick Wilson,\n\nsaid that the students of the UWI are prepared in principle to pay more for\n\ntheir education, but certain main issues had to be resolved.\n He said these issues are: how much must students be required to pay,\n\nand that this would depend on affordability; if the fees should be paid in\n\nlump sum or over a period of time, and what mechanisms are there to ensure\n\nthat the students can access loan funding, thus ensuring that students from\n\nthe lower socio-economic groupings are not prevented from entering the\n\nUniversity because of their inability to pay. \n\n  Mr. Wilson said that after numerous consultations with students, a\n\nmore detailed examination of the financial position of the University, and a\n\nrealistic assessment of the budgetary constraints of the governments of the\n\nregion, the Guild had come up with certain proposals. \n\n  These include the introduction of the new fee structure on a\n\nphased basis, which would see undergraduate students at Mona paying 5 percent\n\nof their economic cost in 1993- 94, 7.5 percent in 1994-95 and 10 percent in\n\n1995-96; a proposal that students at St. Augustine be asked to pay a flat\n\nrate of TT$3,800 per student, irrespective of faculty; that undergraduate\n\nstudents from non  -  campus territories be asked to pay 33 1/3\n\npercent of their economic cost, and that postgraduates be asked to pay 30\n\npercent and not 50 percent as was originally proposed. \n\n  Mr. Wilson said further that the Joint Guild has been able to get\n\nthe University to understand that an up front payment of 15 percent would be\n\nburdensome and impossible for many students.\n The University and the governments of the region were therefore\n\nwilling to have the  " phased in"  approach rather than the\n\nlump sum payment.\n He said they have been able to convince the University and\n\ngovernments also that a proper loan mechanism should be in place before there\n\ncan be any increase. \n\n  The Mona Guild president indicated that they as well as\n\nadministration of the UWI would like the issue to be resolved as quickly as\n\npossible, so that students planning to enter the institution next year can be\n\naware from as early as possible what financial preparation they need to make.\n\n\n\n  Also speaking at the conference were the guild presidents of Cave\n\nHill, Delano Franklyn, and St. Augustine, Kiran Singh.\n Elaborating on the loan mechanism that they wanted to see in place,\n\nMr. Franklyn said this was one of the most crucial and important factors that\n\nhave been part of their discussions since September 1991.\n He said that both of the campuses in Jamaica and Trinidad have been\n\nhaving favourable discussions with the commercial sectors and to a very large\n\nextent with the governments. \n\n  They have therefore come to a level of agreement that the\n\ncommercial sector would be willing to provide   \n\nsubstantial   sums to help students.\n The Barbados government had already taken a decision that their\n\nstudents would not be required to pay the increased fees. \n\n  He said the area of difficulty was on the question of who would\n\nstand as guarantors for the loans, the level of interest payment, and over\n\nwhat period of time would students be allowed to access such loans.\n Mr. Franklyn said these issues would have to be addressed and the\n\ndetails ironed out before there could be any agreement.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  The 1992 Copyright Act was passed unanimously in Parliament\n\nyesterday. \n\n  Prime Minister P.J. Patterson, commenting on the Act referred to\n\nit as a  " major innovative legislation, which commanded the unanimous\n\nsupport of the entire House."  \n\n  Leader of the Opposition, Edward Seaga, in welcoming the passage\n\nof the Act noted that Jamaica now conforms to any of several international\n\nconventions which, he said, allow creative works to be protected. \n\n  Mr. Seaga, in making his contribution to the debate, focussed on\n\nthe development of the music industry from its early stages of ska and rock\n\nsteady, through reggae which, with the likes of Marley, took Jamaica onto the\n\ninternational stage, to its current form, dance hall. \n\n  He chose the music industry, he said, not to the exclusion of\n\nother intellectual pursuits needing copyright protection, but because it was\n\nfrom here that the cry for protection was greatest and also because this area\n\ntruly showed the creative force of the Jamaican people. \n\n  He questioned however, the limiting of the period for which the\n\nintellectual copyright endures.\n Although the extension to 50 years from the previous 30 years was an\n\nimprovement he said, it was less than the 70 years given in other countries.\n He felt the issue should be discussed in international fora\n\nconcerning giving the same tenure of ownership to intellectual property as\n\nwell as to physical.\n In addition, he noted, this would be to the advantage of the poor,\n\nthe less skilled, those of limited academic qualification, from whom a wealth\n\nof creativity came, as they would be able to bequeath their creations to\n\ntheir successors, without termination. \n\n  such\n\nas folklore traditions should be protected by mechanisms which ensure that\n\nthose who profit from it should pay less fees for its usage. \n\n  He also asked why there could not be the adoption of a system of\n\nactual registration for works rather than the performance itself.\n\n\n  On the subject of increased piracy of works with the advanced\n\ntechnology, he said that although there was no way to prevent it, artistes\n\ncould benefit from a mechanism where the state collected duties on imported\n\nvideo equipment, the funds being made available for the general use of the\n\nartistes. \n\n  In closing, he suggested to the Prime Minister that in\n\nrecognition of the achievements of our musicians, thought be given to an\n\ninstitute of popular music, for the training of artistes, their exposition to\n\ntheir rights, the collection of copies of every recording, the training of\n\nthe artistes in the very legislation being passed, and the creation of a\n\nmechanism to give artistes the respect due them. \n\n  Senator Carl Rattray, in responding, traced the previous attempts\n\nto enact and pass the copyright law, saying that this bill was one of the\n\nlongest in preparation in modern Jamaica.\n He said it was interesting for him that moral rights were included in\n\nthe legislation.\n He briefly outlined some of the provisions of the legislation, noting\n\nthat parliamentarians would be happy that they would be free to quote works\n\nin the performance of their duties. \n\n  He ended by saying that the utility of the legislation would be\n\njudged by its impact on our culture, and that our creators would be the\n\nmonitors of it, prompting any necessary changes. \n\n  The Prime Minister, in his contribution, said that the passage of\n\nthe Act did not mean the end to the discussion of some of the difficult\n\nareas, but that it had come to the stage where it was more prudent to pass\n\nit, in its present form. \n\n  Answering some of Mr. Seaga\'s concerns, with regards to the\n\nquestion of those creations in the  " public domain"  , he\n\nsaid that  " though he agreed with the protection of these works, this\n\nwould not be effected via the Act, but possibly, by separate legislation,\n\n sui generis  , being a type proposed."  \n\n  With regards to the suggestion to register artistes, he was very\n\nanxious to avoid a bureaucratic and cumbersome system.\n He said that without registration, creators of works were afforded\n\nprotection as long as they performed the work for the first time. \n\n  Mr. Patterson next spoke of the promotion of the entertainment\n\nindustry which he recognized as one of the fastest growing and great earners\n\nof foreign exchange and said that steps had been taken to upgrade and provide\n\nfor the better legal and economic grounds to encourage artistes to give of\n\ntheir skills and talents. \n\n  The Prime Minister ended by thanking those who had helped the\n\nlegislation to become a reality.\n He added that once the Act was passed, there would be the need to\n\nembark upon a process of widespread dissemination and public education so\n\nthat everybody would know their rights and responsibilities.\n The Prime Minister then moved successful motions for a second and\n\nthird reading of the Bill.  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  &bullet;

{'text': 'This is the second in a series on the public transportation\n\nsystem.\n Today\'s article looks at the history of Jamaica\'s public transport,\n\nespecially in the Corporate Area, leading up to the present situation. \n\n  Much like the common sight of speeding mini-buses, recollections\n\nof how Jamaica\'s public transportation system slipped into today\'s muddled\n\nstate are often blurred. \n\n  But rolled back, the route covered by transport systems over\n\ndecades bears striking resemblance to the present.\n And if the old cliche of history repeating itself unfolds, today\'s\n\nsystem of public transport could be in for a prolonged bumpy ride. \n\n  In November 1982, not long before Government\'s decision to turn\n\nover Jamaica\'s public transport almost exclusively to individual operators,\n\nthen Minister of Transport, Pearnel Charles called the system  "\n\ncomplete nonsense"  .\n " harum scarum"\n\n way urban transport was operated.\n That system paired the Jamaica Omnibus Service ( JOS) and mini- buses\n\nto serve the Corporate Area. \n\n  But over 10 years and a switch of Government later, the transport\n\ntag has changed little.\n In 1992, with the JOS long gone, Government called public\n\ntransportation  " poor"  and Minister of Transport Robert\n\nPickersgill stoutly defended a decision not to grant fare increases, first\n\nrequested at the beginning of the year, until there is  " a visible\n\nimprovement in the system." \n Even long-time bus operators, such as Arthur Chin, admit that the\n\nsystem is tilting precariously close to collapse. \n\n  Mr. Chin\n\nsaid last week,  " but not yet written off."  \n\n  More than 50 years ago, any crash would have made far less noise.\n Demands on the public transport system were significantly lower.\n In 1943, the population of Kingston and St. Andrew was 238,000.\n By 1991 it rose to almost 650,000.\n The population climb overall in Jamaica brought additional problems\n\nfor public transport, but in the Corporate Area, including rapidly developing\n\nSt. Catherine, the intensity of those problems magnified. \n\n  Still, the increase of motorized public transportation in Jamaica\n\nafter the turn of this century, gave few indications of the problems to come.\n Then the tram car, controlled by the light and power company,\n\noccupied the main routes running on roadways through Kingston and lower St.\n\nAndrew.\n Ad hoc bus lines filled out supplementary routes.\n But soon the demands changed.\n Additional motor vehicles increased the need for road use.\n The tram car eventually departed, and by the late 1940s privately\n\ncontracted bus service had already rolled into the Corporate Area. \n\n  However, the fickle footing of the business side of public\n\ntransport had already shown.\n Lack of profits forced early private operators to give up the urban\n\nfranchise, and the JOS Company Ltd., controlled mostly by England-based\n\ninvestors wooed by local interest, took over responsibility for Corporate\n\nArea public transportation in 1953. \n\n  For many years the JOS steadied Jamaica\'s public transport\n\nsystem.\n But the stint proved an extended lull before a turbulent storm.\n "\n\npenny wise and pound foolish"  efficient public transport was lost,\n\npossibly forever. \n\n  The JOS had kept the growing urban population moving with\n\nadequate scheduling and maintenance.\n For example, no bus was kept on the road after 10 years.\n Regardless of its condition, it was replaced.\n At its peak, the privately-owned JOS had more than 550 buses on the\n\nroad each day.\n But the company needed additional income to remain profitable.\n , was\n\nrequested but not approved by the Government.\n As time passed the company cut back on maintenance costs.\n Buses stayed on the roads longer - up to 16 years.\n The standard of public transportation deteriorated, but remained\n\neffective. \n\n  said Mr. Chin,\n\na 40-year veteran of the transport system  .\n\n\n  The Government, meanwhile, showed interest in acquiring the JOS,\n\nalthough word was already out that the company was willing to put more buses\n\ninto the system if the fare increase was granted.\n It never came.\n By 1974, the JOS was acquired by the Government, keen on controlling\n\nanother essential service, at a price related to a net asset value of\n\n$3,5 million. \n\n\n  While rural transportation trudged along mainly unaltered, the\n\nurban system was about to undergo a major upheaval.\n Although the Government had refused to grant a fare increase to the\n\nprivately-owned JOS, it managed to subsidise its new acquisition handsomely,\n\nby some reports up to\n\n$12 million per year.\n But the JOS had already been plagued by relentless industrial\n\ndisputes.\n Work stoppages, mainly strikes or sick-outs, consistently disrupted\n\nthe service.\n\n\n  " The public, as has been the case of previous JOS\n\nstrikes, was the greatest loser,"  the Jamaica Employers Federation\n\nstated during a 1972 strike. \n\n  But JOS work stoppages continued, averaging about one each year\n\nfor several years.\n The strikes took their toll, and eventually led to the legitimisation\n\nof a rapidly growing phenomenon - the mini-bus service.\n Mini-buses rode routes the weakened JOS could not.\n Reports of thefts, especially spare parts, also cost the JOS dearly.\n The strikes also released a number of JOS workers into mini-bus\n\noperations.\n More crushing to the public, some mini-buses charged fares higher\n\nthan those authorised for the JOS. \n\n  By 1982, the Ministry of Public Utilities and Transport reported\n\nthat when the JLP Government took over in 1980, the deficit for the JOS was\n\n$30 million, and the JOS was seen as a national disgrace.\n " checkered history of\n\nlabour troubles and general inefficiency."  \n\n  In December 1983, the Government divested the JOS.\n The buses were eventually sold, and the franchise for providing\n\nKingston Metropolitan Region ( KMR) with public transportation was split\n\namong several private operators who were allotted packages of bus routes.\n\n\n  But since 1979, many of the routes had already been\n\nsub-franchised, with mini-buses carrying about 80 per cent of the passenger\n\njourneys, and the JOS 20 per cent.\n The JOS lost big, and in the year of divestment, 1983, the company\'s\n\nincome totalled\n\n$15,3 million while expenditure hovered just above\n\n$42 million.\n At that time only about 140 JOS buses serviced routes each day.\n\n\n  " The mini-bus system was born out of the inefficiency of\n\nthe JOS as operated by Government,"  said Dennis Harris another\n\nlong-time bus operator. \n\n\n  The service in Montego Bay, the country\'s second largest urban\n\ncentre, also declined.\n In 1983 only nine buses operated by the Montego Bay Municipal Bus\n\nCompany ( MBMBC) worked each day, down from 12 in 1982 and 17 in 1981.\n The number of routes covered dropped from 10 to eight.\n Except for the Jamaica Railway Corporation ( JRC), which managed to\n\nreduce operating expenses by 3 per cent below 1982, and increase revenues by\n\n14 per cent, the transport sector unearthed few good signs. \n\n  By now the mini-buses had emerged as the dominant force of urban\n\npublic transportation.\n The numbers grew steadily.\n By 1988 the public passenger transport fleet was 3,340 buses,\n\ntotalling 65,586 seats.\n In 1988 the KMR was served by 1,220 legal buses, providing 27,133\n\nseats.\n\n\n  The public embraced the new force in public transport.\n The mini-buses stopped anywhere to pick up or let off passengers,\n\nwhen the JOS was restricted to assigned bus stops.\n The mini-buses were swifter than the lumbering JOS buses.\n People got to destinations quicker.\n\n\n  ( Next week: the problems of the transportation system\n\ntoday)  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  The major political parties are set to write a new page in the\n\nisland\'s political history when for the first time, husband and wife teams\n\nwill appear on the ballot in a general election. \n\n  The People\'s National Party, ( PNP) and the Jamaica Labour Party,\n\n( JLP) are throttling up. \n\n  Among the candidates readying themselves on the JLP side are Lola\n\nRamocan, educator, who is running in north west Clarendon and George Ramocan,\n\nformer senator, publisher and coffee farmer, who will contest west rural St.\n\nAndrew. \n\n  On the PNP slate are Karlene Robertson, former councillor in the\n\nKSAC, who is running in north east St. Andrew and Senator Dr. Paul Robertson\n\nin south east St. Catherine. \n\n  George Ramocan once served as a councillor in the Knockpatrick\n\ndivision of central Manchester, but this will be his first outing in the big\n\nleagues.\n\n\n  They met in 1962 when they were selected as the island\'s student\n\nrepresentatives to Expo in Canada. \n\n  That meeting culminated in marriage.\n\n\n\n  Lola is from Ballieston, Clarendon, and returns to familiar turf.\n She attended Alston School and Frankfield High School.\n\n\n  At one time, Mrs. Ramocan was supervising her opponent Carl\n\nMarshall, when he was headmaster of Kemps Hill and she was education officer.\n\n\n  George represented the JLP in the Senate between 1983 and 1989\n\nand is now executive director of Jamaica Institute of Political Education,\n\nJIPE. \n\n  He also returns to his roots as he is from Lawrence Tavern.\n His opponent is pharmacist Vernon Robinson, a newcomer to\n\ncompetitive politics. \n\n  The Ramocans have regular devotions and family conferences to\n\nkeep their children abreast of developments. \n\n  Many will remember the energetic KSAC Councillor Karlene Kirlew\n\nof the 1970\'s who was at the forefront of the movement to establish the PNP\n\nwomen\'s auxiliary.\n Now as Karlene Robertson, she will be challenging Douglas Vaz.\n He was named among the gang of five, who fell out of favour with the\n\nleadership of the JLP. \n\n  Mrs Robertson is a coffee farmer.\n\n\n  Dr. Robertson has been at the ringside of party politics but he\n\nhas never actually entered the ring, now he is donning gloves to challenge\n\nseasoned campaigner - Kingsley Sangster. \n\n  Dr. Robertson was quick to point out that as general secretary\n\nof the PNP for many years, he was intimately involved in running election\n\ncampaigns at all levels. \n\n  But why has he decided to run now?\n\n\n \n\n \n " Politics has been my life.\n I have given up an academic career to go into politics, so the next\n\nstep in terms of completing that career and helping the party that I believe\n\nin and love, is to contest a seat."  \n\n  As an early indication of the turn his life would take, Dr.\n\nRobertson\'s M Sc. thesis in 1971 was titled  " political behaviour at\n\nthe grass roots level"  . \n\n  With his wife involved in her own campaign, Dr. Robertson admits\n\nthey see very little of each other,  " except late at nights."\n\n \n\n  Husband and wife teams are not new to politics.\n For example, Valrie McNeil served as a Councillor in the Hughenden\n\ndivision of the KSAC while her husband Dr. Kenneth McNeil was Member of\n\nParliament in the newly created north west St. Andrew constituency. \n\n  And over in St. Ann, Aabuthnott Gallimore was a Member of\n\nParliament and his wife, Myrtle, a Councillor for the Alexandria division.\n Meanwhile in Hanover, Cleveland Stanhope was western Hanover Member\n\nof Parliament and his wife, Zena was Councillor and eventually became Mayor\n\nof Lucea. \n\n  And Madame Rose Leon, who was a pioneer of the 1940\'s, was\n\nsucceeded in the western St. Andrew constituency by her husband Arthur in\n\n1959, when she fell out of favour with the JLP and was barred from running in\n\nthe constituency.\n She later contested the seat as an independent and eventually\n\ncrossed the floor and joined the PNP in 1966.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Despite a call by the National Consumers League ( NCL) to lower\n\nprices on six basic food items last month, it appears that nothing has been\n\ndone so far. \n\n  On December 30, 1992 the NCL called for a reduction in the\n\nprices of tinned cheese, tinned mackerel in tomato sauce, bulk cornmeal,\n\ncounter flour, chicken necks and backs, and skimmed milk powder.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'e37c3cac-8ba6-4c73-a4f1-6973b2a92abf', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.444563+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9774864912033081, 'non_english_score': 0.022513508796691895}
{'text': 'CANADIAN and United States aid to Jamaica is being slashed as\n\nfunds are being diverted to assist East European countries as well as\n\nfamine-ridden countries such as Bangladesh and Somalia. \n\n  The word from the Unites States Agency for International\n\nDevelopment ( USAID) is that this year has seen a US$1.8 million cut in the\n\nPL480 programme, a US$1.5 million cut in development assistance programme and\n\na drastic reduction by US$10 million in the Economic Support Fund. \n\n  And the word from the Canadian International Development Agency (\n\nCIDA) is that not only is food aid being cut: the Canadian Government is now\n\nstudying proposals for future cuts in other aid programmes as well as a\n\nscaling down of balance-of-payments support for Jamaica. \n\n  The cuts are set to have spiralling effects as they will speed up\n\nthe phasing out of Canadian support programmes to Jamaica such as the Bridge\n\nBuilding Project, the metallic minerals support programme to the Ministry of\n\nMining and smaller projects. \n\n  Peter Houliston, Counsellor and Programme Director of Development\n\nat the Canadian High Commission, told the  Gleaner  that the planned\n\ngovernment development assistance budget for the next two years has been cut\n\nby 10 per cent. \n\n  " The economic situation in Canada like most\n\nindustrialised countries has been subjected to a recession for the past three\n\nyears and the Federal Government has been incurring for a number of years, a\n\nlarge budgetary deficit which has now accumulated into a debt of Can$450\n\nmillion, this means that about a third of all tax dollars goes to pay\n\ninterest on the debt."  \n\n \n\n  This recession has affected the Government\'s ability to give more\n\nto international aid and has forced the Government to embark on a series of\n\nexpenditure cuts since December.\n This means a scaling down of programmes in countries like Jamaica.\n\n\n\n  This is further heightened by the great demand on Canada from\n\nAfrican nations and other famine-ridden countries for food aid as Canada\'s\n\nfood aid to these countries is primarily on a humanitarian basis, whereas\n\nfood aid to Jamaica was given for balance of payments support. \n\n  Jamaica receives balance of payments support under the CIDA\n\ncounterpart fund programme.\n But reports are that food-aid under the CIDA programme has already\n\nbeen cut this year and future agreements are uncertain. \n\n  Mr. Houliston said prior to this, the Jamaican Government along\n\nwith the Canadian officials had been having discussions on how to consolidate\n\nprogrammes into major areas as it was felt that the Canadian programmes were\n\nto disbursed. \n\n  Major focus would go to education and human resource development,\n\nagriculture and environment while areas to be phased out were the bridge\n\nbuilding programme which CIDA has been involved in for 30 years: projects in\n\nthe metallic minerals and small projects such as the twinning of the Society\n\nof Engineers with Canadian counterparts. \n\n  The results of the budget cuts will be that these programmes will\n\nbe phased out more quickly, he said.\n The phasing out of these projects is expected to be completed\n\nsometime this year. \n\n  The budget cuts, he said, will also impact on Jamaica\'s balance\n\nof payments support from that country.\n However, he said the feeling of the Canadian Government was that with\n\nthe required policy steps and stabilization of the dollar and an increase in\n\nJamaica\'s national reserve meant that there was a decreasing need for balance\n\nof payment support from countries such as Canada. \n\n  According to an official from the USAID, the development\n\nassistance to Jamaica which has been in the form of grants used for\n\ndevelopment projects was down this year to US$13.2 million, one of the lowest\n\nlevels compared to a total of US$15.7 last year and a little more than US$14\n\nmillion in the previous year. \n\n  The reason for the cuts in US development assistance aid, the\n\nofficial said, was that countries like Eastern Europe and the newly\n\nindependent states in the former Soviet Union were being given priority in\n\nterms of development assistance. \n\n  This, he said, made it difficult for countries like Jamaica to\n\nget support in this area. \n\n  Regarding the Economic Support Fund, he added that he did not\n\nexpect more than US$5 million to Jamaica this year compared to US$15 million\n\nlast year.\n Allocations under the ESF, the official said, was tentative as there\n\nwas no formal projection for this type of fund. \n\n  " International foreign assistance ( from US) has not\n\ndeclined but other priorities are emerging in Eastern Europe as well as\n\nemergencies in Africa,"  the official said. \n\n  This year, the projected budget for the PL480 programme under\n\nwhich Jamaica imports agricultural products from the US on a special\n\nconcession to be repaid on a long-term basis of 10 years or more is US$30\n\nmillion.\n\n\n  However, the official said expectations are that the allocation\n\nunder the PL480 will be increased by the US Department of Agriculture for\n\nfiscal year 1993/94 based on the availability of funds as well as priorities.\n\n\n\n  He said although bi-lateral aid to Jamaica from the US was\n\nscaling down, the country was    benefiting \n\n from debt relief programmes under the Enterprise for the Americas\n\nInitiative.\n In addition, debt relief under the PL480 programme last year was\n\nUS$217 million and already the debt reduction from USAID for this year has\n\nbeen US$94 million. \n\n  This, he said, decreased the amount of international debt held by\n\nJamaica and also served to balance the country\'s need for aid in the areas\n\nthat have been slashed.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  DIRECTOR of Public Prosecutions, Glen Andrade, and\n\nAuditor-General Adrian Strachan, have, in their investigations into the\n\nirregularities of the accounts of the Jamaica Attraction Development Ltd., (\n\nJADCO) found that fraud appeared to have been committed. \n\n  This disclosure was made at yesterday\'s sitting of the Public\n\nAccounts Committee when a letter from Mr. Andrade and a Special Report on\n\nJADCO from the Auditor-General were made public. \n\n  At the centre of the investigations is JADCO\'s former managing\n\ndirector, Ossie Seymour, who was a People\'s National Party ( PNP) candidate\n\nin the 1989 general elections. \n\n  Appointed to the position of managing director of the company in\n\nMay 1989, Mr. Seymour was sent on leave in January 1992 by then Prime\n\nMinister Michael Manley because of irregularities in JADCO\'s accounting\n\nsystem and was later asked to resign. \n\n \n " Based on my preliminary assessment of the Auditor-General\'s report\n\nit would seem that fraud has been committed.\n If this is substantiated by the investigations, criminal proceedings\n\nwill be instituted."  \n\n  Mr. Andrade extended a request to the PAC not to embark on an\n\nenquiry as it had planned.\n " I am\n\nclearly of the opinion that even though the matter is not sub judice in the\n\nsense that criminal proceedings in the Courts have not been instituted, it\n\nwould not be in the interest of justice for the committee to embark upon an\n\nenquiry which might prejudice the trial."  \n\n  After some debate on the request, particularly between chairman\n\nBruce Golding and Government member A.J. Nicholson, the Committee took the\n\ndecision not to deal with the particular issue but to examine some general\n\nsituation in the Ministry of Tourism under which JADCO falls. \n\n  transactions which came under\n\n   scrutiny   include Mr. Seymour\'s\n\ninvolvement in an investment with the Bank of Credit and Commerce\n\nInternational ( Overseas) ( BCCI). \n\n  According to the Auditor-General\'s report, on January 18,\n\n$150,000 was paid by JADCO to the BCCI to be placed on fixed deposit.\n Based on correspondence seen by the Auditor-General, this transaction\n\nwas made in Mr. Seymour\'s name. \n\n  In addition, the Auditor-General reported that a number of\n\nreceipts, all dated February 4, 1991 were seen at JADCO with the stamp of\n\nRecreational Development Corporation Ltd. affixed to them and signed by Ossie\n\nSeymour, purporting to acknowledge receipts of\n\n$260,000. \n\n  Mr. Strachan noted that over the period December 1989 to January\n\n1992, other payments totalling\n\n$369,508 were made by JADCO to Mr. Seymour, purportedly for salaries, fees,\n\nadvances, travelling expenses and chairman\'s expenses. \n\n  " My calculation of the amount to which he was entitled\n\nfor the same period in respect of those expenses is\n\n$150,700," the Auditor-General reported. \n\n  In addition,\n\n$150,000 was applied against the purchases of a Ford motor-car sold to JADCO\n\nby a company in which Mr. Seymour was a principal shareholder.\n This, it was noted, left what appeared to be an overpaid balance of\n\n$68,808.46 at January 31, 1991. \n\n  Included in this was an amount\n\n$55,555 paid to Mr. Seymour on August 14 for salary in respect of the period\n\nMay 1 to August 31, 1991.\n However, the Auditor-General said he was not satisfied that Mr.\n\nSeymour was entitled to payment since, from correspondence seen, a salary was\n\nnot payable to him before November 1, 1991.\n\n\n  The motor car which was purchased by JADCO was assigned full time\n\nto Mr. Seymour and maintained by JADCO.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  ASSISTANT Commissioner Nelson Fogah has described as inaccurate a\n\n Gleaner  story carried last week, which said his transfer to Area 2\n\nheadquarters resulted from statements he made about missing police guns\n\nrecently. \n\n  " most misleading"\n\n and said it was sloppy journalism.\n He said he had known about the transfer since the first week of\n\nJanuary and even welcomed it because the post was near to his hometown -\n\nHighgate. \n\n  On Thursday, January 28, radio reports quoted Fogah as saying\n\nthat 153 guns were missing from police stations islandwide.\n Fogah was commissioned to conduct a physical audit of the police\n\nfirearms islandwide.\n The statements, which Fogah said were misunderstood, turned public\n\nattention to the police once again and there were calls for explanations from\n\nthe Commissioner of Police, Roy Thompson. \n\n  on January 28\n\nsaid that the Assistant Commissioner was misunderstood and attempted an\n\nexplanation. \n\n  One week later on Wednesday February 3, it was reported that\n\nFogah was being transferred to Area 2 Headquarters in Annotto Bay, St. Mary.\n The transfer, the report claimed, was because of information which\n\nFogah had  " leaked"  to the media. \n\n  yesterday, Fogah explained\n\nthe transfer.\n He said his was one in a chain of transfers which was recommended by\n\nthe Commissioner to the Police Services Commission. \n\n  He would be replacing Assistant Commissioner R. Roach presently\n\nin charge of Area 2 Headquarters.\n Roach, he said, would be taking command of the Mobile Reserve\n\nDivision and would be replacing Assistant Commissioner Fred Evering.\n\n\n  Fogah, who presently commands the Services Division, said that\n\nthe transfers were only still recommendations, because he did not know if\n\nthat have been approved by the Service Commission. \n\n  The Assistant Commissioner also said he was not relieved of his\n\nposition as was also reported.\n He said he was asked to concentrate fully on the audit which is\n\nexpected to be completed within two months. \n\n  Commenting on what caused further controversy during the issue\n\nwas when Deputy Commissioner Rudyard Hamilton spoke on radio and said that\n\nnone was being transferred.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  THE small Church of God of Prophecy in the remote district of\n\nHillside, St. Thomas, was filled to capacity last Saturday afternoon, for the\n\nfuneral service for young Gilbert Brown who died two weeks ago when flood\n\nrains caused the walls of the room in which he was sleeping to collapse on\n\nhim. \n\n  Among the mourners who crowded in the tiny wooden structure were\n\nGilbert\'s classmates from the Hillside Primary School.\n In hushed voices they spoke about their friend whose remains laid in\n\na cream-velvet casket, dressed in black pants and white tuxedo shirt. \n\n  Outside, the skies were overcast and the intermittent drizzle\n\nserved as stark reminders of how the nine-year-old died. \n\n  Leaning against a tree with a solemn look on his face was Gilbert\n\nBrown senior, the boy\'s father.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5bbf6d61-8a8f-4af1-9a9f-9fe7d1206c3f', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.445823+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9842067360877991, 'non_english_score': 0.015793263912200928}
{'text': 'TWO French engineers have been brought in by the Government to\n\nrebuild engines, so that the financially-troubled Jamaica Railway Corporation\n\n( JRC) whose operations have been suspended for the past four months, can be\n\nrestarted. \n\n \n\n the work although they arrived here on January 12, nearly a month ago,\n\nbecause staff at the JRC has been restive.\n The workers say they are willing to work, but they were not prepared\n\nto do so at the rates at which they are currently being paid. \n\n  The work has also failed to get off the ground because the French\n\nengineers require only 21 workers, including mechanics, electricians and\n\nairbrake men to work with them in rebuilding the engines.\n This, however, could cause some problem because the workers learned\n\nthat this would mean a boost in the salary of those working with the French\n\nnationals, while the others are left to live off their  " meagre"\n\n salaries.\n can\'t work, some worker can\'t have\n\nfood on their table and some don\'t have,"  said one maintenance\n\nworker. \n\n  wage contract expired at the end of\n\nDecember 1990, and to date negotiations for a new contract has not started,\n\naccording to Senator Dwight Nelson, Second Vice President of the Bustamante\n\nIndustrial Trade Union ( BITU) which represents them. \n\n  Senator Nelson said the BITU had written to the JRC management\n\nasking that negotiations be started for a new wage contract, but management\n\nsay they could do nothing until a decision was taken at the Cabinet level.\n\n\n\n  The JRC suspended its operations on October 2, 1992, because,\n\namong other things, it could no longer continue to buy fuel for its engines\n\nand pay salaries.\n Workers are still being paid and they continue to turn up for duties\n\nin the mornings, but with little or nothing to do. \n\n  Many of them, however, like one chargeman, a position next in\n\nline to the foreman\'s, have been taking home less than\n\n$1 a week since the service was suspended.\n The chargeman, who did not want to be identified by name, showed 15\n\nof his weekly salary cheques to this reporter, each of which was valued at\n\nbetween 43 and 45 cents. \n\n  Some 80 per cent of the workers have been sent on vacation leave\n\nsince January, but even with the skeleton staff, there is nothing much to do\n\nbecause the trains are not rolling. \n\n \n\n  The workers, including a mechanic of 31 years standing, who now\n\ntakes home in the region of\n\n$370 a week, explained that even though their personal incomes were meagre,\n\nwhen the services were in operation, the possibility existed for them to take\n\nhome more money, earned from overtime work. \n\n  Some of them say their electricity and water had been\n\ndisconnected because they could not continue to pay, and for them to buy food\n\nthey have to borrow additional money, hoping to repay it when they get\n\nretroactive payments for salary. \n\n  They made it clear that they had not stopped working, that they\n\nwere willing to work,  " but we can\'t work on the old rate"  .\n\n\n\n  Some of the workers, especially those who said they have served\n\nthe Corporation for upwards of 10 years, were adamant that Government should\n\nmake them redundant.\n " What you say to a man who has worked here for 36 years, and\n\nnow has a son and a daughter in University and him can\'t get any money?"\n\n asked a woman who has been employed by the JRC for 10 years.\n\n\n  Owen Crooks, general manager of the JRC, said the management was\n\nstill awaiting word from the Ministry of Public Utilities and Transport to\n\ntell them about the future of the Corporation. \n\n  Spare parts bought from the French Government some time ago,\n\nstarted arriving in November and the last set arrived between December and\n\nJanuary.\n Mr. Crooks, however, confirmed that there has been a delay in the\n\nFrench  work because of salary issues with the staff which\n\nis yet to be resolved. \n\n  Workers blame the JRC management for using up money to rent cars\n\nfor managers and paying thousands of dollars to transport a payroll to its\n\noffices in Montego Bay, while a new Leyland pick-up truck and cars which can\n\nbe repaired sit idly at the Corporation\'s offices at Barry Street in\n\nKingston. \n\n \n\nremuneration package a car was supposed to be given to them.\n " we have to\n\nkeep them mobile, so we have to rent cars,"  said Mr. Crooks. \n\n  The general manager said he did not see it necessary to expend\n\nmoney to repair the Leyland truck at this time.\n claim, the truck was not\n\nsuitable to transport the payroll because it could only accommodate people in\n\nthe cab and security would be needed for such transport. \n\n  Neither Minister of Public Utilities, Transport and Energy,\n\nRobert Pickersgill nor his Minister of State, Robert Jones, was in office\n\nwhen the  Gleaner  tried to reach them yesterday. \n\n \n\nGleaner  that the Minister was pursuing efforts with the private sector\n\nfor the restoration of the rail service. \n\n  He said the French engineers were brought in under a technical\n\nassistance programme and they were here at the expense of the French\n\nGovernment. \n\n  Mr. Perkins said the Ministry was aware of the restiveness of the\n\nworkers and that there could be a problem if only a selected number of the\n\nworkers were asked to work with the engineers.\n He said the JRC\'s issue has been before Cabinet for some time now,\n\nand next week, there will be a meeting at which the question of the work with\n\nthe French engineers will be addressed. \n\n  The Corporation\'s general manager said the workers were currently\n\nbeing paid by the Government, but, according to Mr. Perkins, the JRC was\n\npaying the workers through loan from Government sources he did not wish to\n\nidentify. \n\n  Mr. Perkins said a decision had not been taken to make the\n\nworkers redundant.\n The Port Authority and other entities have expressed interest in\n\nusing the railway for transporting cargo and the Minister was using those\n\ninterests as the basis for discussions to have the service back in operation.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  RESIDENTS of sections of Manchester who have been under siege by\n\ngunmen for over five months are living on the edge, afraid that the\n\nterrorists will soon strike again. \n\n  said 63-year-old\n\nHubert Coley, a victim at the hands of these gunmen.\n " When we turn in at nights we are wondering who will be the\n\nnext victim."  \n\n  As he spoke, he pointed a gnarled finger, on a hand which bore\n\nthe evidence of much hard work in the field, at the back door of his house\n\nwhich was kicked off by gunmen last week.\n It was the second time in three weeks that his house had been robbed.\n\n\n\n  Since last November, a group of gunmen have been terrorizing\n\nfarmers and their families in the communities of Devon, Chudleigh, Porus and\n\nChristiana in that parish.\n But two weeks ago these gunmen stepped up their activities in the\n\narea, and moving one pace ahead of the police, left one man dead and another\n\nshot in the face.\n They made off with goods and cash from the homes of several other\n\ncitizens who were held at gunpoint after their doors were kicked off by\n\nmasked gunmen. \n\n \n\n  The robbery at Mr. Coley\'s home was the second in two months.\n He said that his daughter, who lives in the United States, was robbed\n\nin December, while here to attend the funeral of her mother. \n\n  According to Mr. Coley, he was sitting in the living room\n\nwatching television with a companion at around 11   \n\no\'clock   one Saturday night, while his daughter was in a nearby\n\nbedroom lying down.\n He became alert after hearing strange sounds coming from the bedroom.\n On investigating, he saw the back door open and on looking outside,\n\nsaw his daughter standing outside with her hands in the air and blood running\n\ndown her face.\n\n\n  She was robbed by two gunmen of her handbag containing U.S. as\n\nwell as local currency and her travel documents.\n As she headed back to the United States she told her father that\n\nperhaps only his death will ever bring her back to Jamaica.\n Mr. Coley lamented the decline in discipline and the rise in crime in\n\neven the most rural districts. \n\n  " Even in this small district, the days are gone when you\n\ncould leave a window or even a door open,"  he said. \n " At nights when you are in bed you have to be sleeping, listening\n\nand watching.\n My heart is no longer contented in a place where I grew up as a\n\nchild, married and raised my children.\n\n\n\n\n  But Mr. Coley is not the only one who share that view.\n Several other citizens who have been robbed said they are sure the\n\nrobbers will strike again as the police has still not nabbed anyone. \n\n  There is some talk about forming a Neighbourhood Watch, but\n\naccording to the residents this presents a problem as the houses are too\n\nscattered. \n\n  " Even if they are holding up my neighbour and him\n\nscreaming I wouldn\'t hear,"  said a respected and popular resident\n\nwho identified himself only as  " Prof"  . \n\n \n\n  In addition, the residents believe that if one of the gunmen is\n\nnot from the area, then there is an informer among them feeding valuable\n\ninformation to the gunmen. \n\n  said one resident.\n " Nowadays if we going to sell anything we have to hide."\n\n \n\n  Mr. Coley also believed that his last attack could be one of\n\nmistaken identity.\n Although he was robbed of cash and large amount of household\n\narticles, he believed that the target was another man who had a similar name\n\nand who supposedly sold a cow that weekend. \n\n  " When they came into the house, they told me to pass\n\nover the cow money or they were going to kill me,"  he said.\n " But I did not sell a cow but I know that that person was\n\nsuppose to sell one that weekend."  \n\n  Residents find the level of information that the gunmen have\n\nbaffling. \n\n  said a\n\nrecent victim who preferred to remain anonymous. \n\n \n " They know if we have a relative come from abroad; if we receive\n\nforeign letters; if we sell anything from the farm.\n\n\n  Efforts by the police have so far been futile, but the residents\n\nclaimed that enough was not being done. \n\n  In other serious attacks, Mr. Martel James, a 64-year-old\n\nreturning resident from the Unites States, was killed when four gunmen\n\ninvaded his home.\n The gunmen gained entry to the house by removing louvre blades from a\n\nbedroom window. \n\n  He was killed when he tried to defend his family.\n\n\n  Mr. Audley Elliot, a resident of Devon, was shot in the eye and\n\nis now a patient in the Percy Junor Hospital. \n\n  According to a close friend of Mr. Elliot, he was alone at home\n\nwhen gunmen entered and demanded money.\n He was said to have told them that he did not have any money.\n\n\n  Irish   potatoes.\n When he refused to hand over any money, he was shot, his house\n\nsearched and the gunmen escaped with at least eight thousand dollars in cash.\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nspread flooding and forcing many to evacuate their homes in the eastern\n\nsection of the island.', 'subdomain':

{'text': 'A MAN with the lower part of his face gone, consumed by thousands\n\nof hungry maggots digging away into his flesh, was discovered on the premises\n\nof the St. Elizabeth Church on Ransford Avenue in the Maxfield Avenue area,\n\nyesterday. \n\n  Totally emaciated and obviously in pain, the man was unable to\n\ntalk as his mouth is completely eaten away.\n He was taken to the Missionary of Charities, a home which accommodates\n\na number of elderly indigents on Tower Street. \n\n  At the institution, seven people including five Nuns from India\n\nwho run the place assumed the evidently difficult task of tending to him.\n\n\n\n  After working on him for more than two hours they began to express\n\nfear that the insects may have reached his brain as they were up to that\n\npoint unsuccessful in getting rid of the maggots. \n\n  A gruesome picture of the \'sisters\' using tweezers to remove\n\nmaggots from the hole which was the lower part of the man\'s face greeted the\n\n Gleaner  team on its arrival at the home minutes past 2 p.m.\n\nyesterday. \n\n  His bared teeth and nose-less face gave him a frightening\n\nappearance.\n He was given water and gulped wildly instead of drinking and grunted\n\nwhen he attempted to talk. \n\n  Pointing to a container of maggots which was earlier removed by\n\nthe application of  \'gallons of antiseptic\'  the Nuns who said\n\nthey had been on the job for more than two hours and had used tweezers in an\n\nattempt to budge the more stubborn ones. \n\n \n\n  that earlier, when\n\nhe was brought to the home, his beard, long, filthy and knotty, was swarmed\n\nwith  " millions of crawling maggots." \n She said the people who were assisting him had to scuttle out of the\n\nway of  " hundreds of flying maggots"  when the man sneezed.\n\n\n\n  This is the second time in a week that the institution had come\n\nto the rescue of men plagued by maggots.\n Two days ago, a man was picked up downtown with his arms filled with\n\nmaggots.\n He was treated by the nuns and was lying in bed recuperating when the\n\n Gleaner  team visited. \n\n  The nuns expressed surprise that the afflicted man appeared to be\n\nsane.\n Making specific reference to the man they had picked up downtown one\n\nof the nuns declared, \n " They are surprisingly sharp.\n\n\n  The old people had high praise for the nuns whom they said came\n\nfrom abroad to work voluntarily but lamented the direction in which the\n\ncountry was going when  " people in this condition are allowed to\n\nlanguish on the highways and by ways in their pathetic state."  \n\n  An angry woman who helps at the institution puts it this way:\n\n\n " The tragedy is that thousands of people passed the ailing man by\n\nand none assisted.\n It is an indictment against the Government and the people of the\n\ncountry.\n And we talk about justice and peace be ours.\n\n\n  She also expressed concern over the functions of the Ministry of\n\nHealth. \n really a matter of public health.\n Are the sick, whether old or young, to be allowed to be left\n\nuntreated on the highways when the public is burdened by heavy taxation?"\n\n she asked.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  \'Total transformation of the educational system\'\n\n  \n\n \n\n  NEW Jamaica Teachers Association president, Ray Howell, has\n\npromised to seek the  " total transformation of the educational\n\nsystem... as our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in\n\neducation."  \n\n  Mr. Howell, 36, was speaking at an investiture ceremony held as\n\npart of the 28th Annual General Conference of the Jamaica Teachers\n\nAssociation which ends today at the American Beach Resort Hotel, Ocho Rios.\n\n\n\n  The new president, who is also principal of the Drew\'s Avenue\n\nPrimary School, spoke on a number of issues, which included the Government\'s\n\nfailure to adequately remunerate teachers, the need for education to be seen\n\nas a long-term investment, the use of the Education Tax, and the delay in\n\nappointing teachers to senior posts that are vacant. \n\n  In a speech punctuated by frequent applause, Mr. Howell said that\n\nwith the exception of those in Guyana the Jamaican teacher was the lowest\n\npaid in the Caribbean.\n Other Caribbean teachers were getting between three to 20 times more\n\nthan the highest-paid teacher in Jamaica, he said. \n\n  Quality education, he said, would come about with the recruitment\n\nand retention of quality teachers.\n " However, quality teachers do not come more cheaply than\n\nquality doctors, business managers or lawyers."  \n\n \n\n  "\n\nwhen the conditions under which it may thrive are identified and carefully\n\nnurtured and made available by those who hold power to assist in creating\n\nthose conditions.\n If you want a quality product then you are careful to monitor all the\n\nstages through which it goes to ensure that the end result will be\n\nsatisfactory,"  he said. \n\n \n\n  &bullet; Use the\n\n$428 million it collected from the Education Tax last year for the original\n\npurpose; \n\n  &bullet; Pay grants owing to Primary and All-Age schools since\n\nApril; \n\n  &bullet; Facilitate school principals with the speed-up of the\n\nprocess by which teachers are appointed to senior positions, particularly\n\nwhenever such positions are vacant. \n\n  &bullet; Desist from granting building contracts for schools to\n\npeople who are incompetent in matters relating to construction. \n\n  "\n\nfundamental change in the formal education system."  \n\n  These changes, she said, must include greater involvement of the\n\nprivate sector in education; an increase in teacher remuneration to\n\nadequately cover the cost of living; and the appointment of all educators on\n\nthe basis of qualification and not through political affiliation. \n\n  The conference ends today.\n The highlight will be a meeting between Education Minister Burchell\n\nWhiteman and the delegates. \n\n  Among those in attendance yesterday were Mr. Burchell Whiteman;\n\nParliamentary Secretary in the Ministry, A.J. Nicholson; Opposition Spokesman\n\non Education, Dr. Neville Gallimore; the Anglican Bishop of Jamaica, Rt. Rev.\n\nNeville DeSouza; and the Custos of St. Ann, Dr. Osmond Tomlinson.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  TAXI operators are no longer using the fare structure set by the\n\nTransport Authority.\n This is because the rate was last revised in 1984 based on the\n\nmetering system. \n\n  The operators say the minibus operators are getting an increase\n\nin their fares and robot minibuses are quickly weeded out of the system yet\n\nno similar attention is paid to them. \n\n  This is the cry of many taxi operators who consider themselves to\n\nbe neglected by the Transport Authority, the governing body that regulates\n\ntheir fare structures and licensing. \n\n  According to Transport Authority Chairman Hensley Williams, there\n\nare plans afoot to look more closely at the entire taxi operation.\n But this will not be done until the 147 buses are strategically\n\nplaced on routes. \n\n  " We have to look closely at the entire operation in\n\nterms of units in the system, fare structure and metering and try to come up\n\nwith a position,"  Mr. Williams said. \n\n  The Transport Chairman said a restructuring of routes was being\n\ndone to maximise efficiency on the routes. \n\n  Most taxi companies are not members of any one umbrella\n\nassociation and operate under their own policies.\n There is only one association formed since 1990, called Metropolitan\n\nTaxi Owners Association.\n\n\n  " We cannot afford to go by the last fare structure and\n\nso we have to set our own rates,"  said Milton Chung of Metropolitan\n\nTaxi Owners Association. \n\n  According to the last set of rates which applies to both metered\n\nand unmetered taxis, fares begin at\n\n$2.50 for the first one-third of a mile or part thereof; for each additional\n\none- third of a mile or part thereof it is 85 cents; for each waiting period\n\nof four minutes it is also 85 cents.\n For a journey ending between 12 midnight and 5 a.m. an additional 25\n\nper cent is charged. \n\n  " The rates are unrealistic and not in keeping with\n\npresent economic conditions,"  one operator said. \n\n  The metering system is almost obsolete.\n checked with some taxi companies none of\n\nthem were using the meter system.\n Most of them did not have a meter in place.\n However, Mr. Willliams said the law made provision for unmetered\n\ntaxis as well. \n\n  The meters were phased out after the high cost in getting spare\n\nparts, they could no longer calibrate at the changing fare stage and the\n\nGovernment did not have the foreign exchange to purchase the meters which are\n\nmanufactured abroad. \n\n  A spokesman with the former Jamaica Taxi Cab company said a flat\n\nrate is being charged according to mileage. \n\n  Taxi operator Raymond Grant said meters were too expensive but\n\ncautions that passengers should ask the cost of fares before taking the\n\ntaxis.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  THE presence of soldiers in Negril, Ocho Rios and Montego Bay is\n\na direct result of a JHTA appeal to the Prime Minister.\n It came after a rising tide of anti-tourist crime climaxed on July\n\n1st with the murder of a Dutch visitor in the environs of Ocho Rios. \n\n  Despite a newsflash on Irie FM, the incident was treated as top\n\nsecret by the authorities. \n\n \n\n Lawrence of PIC told the  Gleaner  that the victim was Fransoes\n\nJohannes Sinkes, a Personnel Counsellor, of Holland.\n He was 53 years of age.\n On July 1st he left the hotel at 2:15 p.m. and went for a walk along\n\nthe White River to collect bamboo.\n His body was found in bushes near the White River between 3 and 4\n\np.m.\n He had wounds to the back of the head and is believed to have been\n\nmurdered. \n\n  On July 17 Radcliffe Williams, 22, and Roy Green, 19, both\n\nlabourers of Exchange District, were arrested and charged with the murder of\n\nSinkes. \n\n  that Sinkes was\n\nstaying at a nearby hotel with his wife.\n when Sinkes was\n\nreported missing.\n " away up in the White River gully"\n\n near a squatter settlement which had recently been partially\n\ncleared.\n\n\n \n\n  The victim\'s brother, who is a journalist, came out to Jamaica\n\nand the story hit the media in Holland plus the advice that visitors to\n\nJamaica should not leave their hotels. \n\n \n\nGleaner  that the embassy here is still awaiting the case report from\n\nthe police.\n He says that last week they promised that it would soon be ready.\n\n\n\n  JHTA sources say that this incident certainly influenced the\n\ndecision to request help from the military, but the situation was getting out\n\nof hand even before it occurred.\n " Harassment may be down but crime is definitely rising"\n\n and robbery at knife-point becoming an almost daily occurrence. \n\n  and\n\n " open door"  policy has reassured the tourism sector.\n According to JHTA sources after two weeks with the soldiers, the\n\nsituation has already improved. \n\n  However, the Commissioner of Police is reported to be annoyed\n\nwith hoteliers who requested assistance from the JDF and his remarks on\n\nMontego Bay\'s Radio Waves talk show last week have reinforced this\n\nperception.\n Gleaner\n\n  " we are grateful for any help we can get."  \n\n  And Gordon Townsend, Managing Director of Caribic Vacations,\n\nsaid  " I sympathize with the police they have been given basket to\n\ncarry water."  \n\n \n " I don\'t know why anybody would feel insecure at the sight of a\n\nsoldier unless they are criminals."  \n\n  According to Townsend, whose company is agent for three weekly\n\ncharters out of Europe, armed security including soldiers are now highly\n\nvisible both in Europe and other tourist destinations like Santo Domingo.\n\n " The greatest threat to tourism is crime, it is not just serious,\n\nit is very serious and time is not on our side.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '22519aa0-a6e7-4b15-b776-1646f68d5d58', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.448555+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9832543134689331, 'non_english_score': 0.016745686531066895}
{'text': 'ROBERT Hill, 34, former inventory clerk of the Houses of\n\nParliament, was yesterday jailed for two years after he was convicted of\n\nfraud in connection with the\n\n$1.5 million Furniture Scandal. \n\n  was how Resident\n\nMagistrate, Mr. Mahadev Dukharan, described Hill, before sentencing him to\n\ntwo years each, on seven counts of fraud.\n The sentences are to run concurrently, so Hill will serve two years.\n\n\n\n  Hill\'s attorney gave verbal notice of appeal and he was offered\n\nbail in the sum of\n\n$500.000, with one or two sureties, pending the outcome of the appeal. \n\n  The Crown represented by Glen Andrade, Q.C., Director of Public\n\nProsecutions and Cheryl Richards, Deputy Director of Public Prosecu <l>\n\ntions, alleged at the trial in the Kingston Criminal Court, that Hill falsely\n\npretended that goods and services were supplied to the residences of\n\nseveral Parliamentarians. \n\n  Attorney-at-law Patrick Bailey, who represented Hill, made an im\n\n<l> passioned plea to the Magistrate to give Hill a suspended sentence. \n\n  At the end of the attorney\'s submission the Magistrate\n\nordered Hill to stand. \n " Your lawyer has made an impassioned plea not to send you to prison.\n You are a very crafty person.\n You were asked to streamline the system, but what you did was to\n\nstreamline your pocket instead.\n I don\'t know what you did with all the money.\n It was a lot of goods.\n Your lawyer asked me not to send you to prison, but I cannot agree\n\nwith him."  \n\n  Count 1 of the indictment charged Hill with conspiring with\n\npersons unknown between December 1989 and February 1991 to defraud the\n\nGovernment of Jamaica by falsely representing that they were entitled to\n\npayments for goods and services supplied to the Government as claimed on\n\nthe invoices submitted for payments.\n The other six counts charged him with causing valuable securities to\n\nbe delivered by means of false pretences. \n\n  Hill sat in the dock taking notes as the judge reviewed the\n\nevidence. \n\n  The judge said he believed Parliamentarian Ben Clare when he\n\nsaid the invoices were given to him to be signed while Parliament was in ses\n\n<l> sion and he had signed them without fully scrutinizing them.\n " rather careless"\n\n and as a lawyer ought to have known better. \n\n  It was the judge\'s finding that after Parliamentarian Desmond\n\nLeakey signed the invoices, other prices were added to the bill. \n\n  In respect to Parliamentarian Sam Lawrence, the judge said,\n\n\n " I accept Lawrence\'s evidence that at no time he discussed anything\n\nabout any uncustomed goods or wrote any letter to Mr. Deans ( Clerk to the\n\nHouses of Parliament) or asked Hill to assist Mrs. Sadler with bills."\n\n \n\n  The judge reviewed the evidence of Canute Sadler, and his wife\n\nMichelle, who were charged jointly with Hill, but had the charges against\n\nthem withdrawn after their companies Meera Manufacturing, Ltd., Meera\n\nMarketing Ltd. and Stephonics Ltd., pleaded guilty.\n The companies were fined a total of\n\n$44,000. \n\n  The judge said out of an abundance of caution, he had to\n\nexamine the  evidence carefully.\n He said that on the totality of the evidence given by the Sadlers in\n\nvital areas, he found other evidence to support their testimonies. \n\n  evidence\n\nbecause they had an interest to serve.\n It was the judge\'s finding that Hill had no consignment arrangement\n\nwith Sadler and the goods Hill took were intended for the Houses of Parlia\n\n<l> ment. \n\n  " I am satisfied to the extent that I feel sure that you\n\nare guilty on all seven counts,"  the judge told Hill. \n\n  The Judge commented that attorney-at-law Patrick Bailey had\n\nhandled the case quite professionally.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  A BOOK of speeches given in Parliament by the leader of the\n\nJamaica Labour Party ( JLP) Edward Seaga, over the last thirty years, was\n\nlaunched at the Jamaica Pegasus Hotel on Thursday night. \n\n  The function represented the first in a series of activities\n\nplanned to mark the Golden Jubilee of the JLP. \n\n  " Edward Seaga - 30 Years of Continuous Service"\n\n was published jointly by the Jamaica Institute of Political\n\nEducation ( JIPE) in co-operation with the Konrad Adenauer Foundation of\n\nGermany.\n It is the first volume of a three part documentation.\n Volume two covers the period 1971 to 1980, while volume three will\n\nfocus on the years 1981 to 1992. \n\n  Editor of the book is JIPE director and former editor of the\n\n Voice  newspaper, Joseph McPherson. \n\n  Speaking at the launch, executive director of the JIPE,\n\nGeorge Ramocan, said there was a critical void of unpublished documents that\n\nis valuable to development and history. \n\n  Mr. Ramocan said there is little documentation, for example, on\n\nthe work of Donald Sangster as a Minister of Finance and Prime Minister\n\nof Jamaica, and it was of great concern that there is no single insti <l>\n\ntution in Jamaica that is geared to identifying, locating, obtaining and\n\nstoring unpublished materials in one place and making them accessible to\n\nthe public. \n\n  " It is this critical need that has driven us, at JIPE,\n\nto undertake the documentation of the major Parliamentary speeches made\n\nby our Prime Ministers which are by and large, published in part or reported\n\nform, based on the judgement of the journalists."  \n\n  The JIPE executive director said he was pleased that the first in\n\nthe series of these documentations, has been done on the 30 years of Mr.\n\nSeaga\'s presentations in Parliament, because it was on his initia <l>\n\ntive that JIPE was formed. \n\n  Presentation of a copy of the book to Mr. Seaga was made by\n\nChristopher Bovell, Chairman of JIPE and Rainer Hasters, Caribbean\n\nrepresentative for the Konrad    Adenauer  \n\nFoundation. \n\n lighted some of his\n\ncontributions, and economic and social policies introduced when he served as\n\nMinister of Development and Welfare during the 1960s, Minister of Fi <l>\n\nnance and Prime Minister and, eventually, JLP leader.\n He paid tribute to persons with whom he has been associated over\n\nthe years. \n\n  These included Lady Bustamante, former Governors of the Bank\n\nof Jamaica Horace Barber and Headley Brown, Gloria Knight, and Corrine\n\nMaClarty among others.\n , and especially former\n\nEditor-in-Chief, Theodore Sealy, for the part it played during the formative\n\nyears of the Party. \n\n  Reminiscing on the struggles and development of the Party, Mr.\n\nSeaga said the JLP has never veered from what it believed in. \n\n \n " We were right of centre in our economic thinking and left of centre\n\nin our social philosophy.\n Most parties which have been able to maintain social\n\nprojects do so with cash, and cash can only come from economic policies\n\nthat are more conservative.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  PROMINENT members of the bar have filed motions for\n\nconstitutional redress on behalf of three Death Row inmates whose crimes were\n\nrecently classified as capital offences under new legislation amending\n\nthe Offences against the Person Act. \n\n  that this may prove to\n\n be  the first step in a long, drawn-out process aimed at saving all\n\nDeath Row prisoners from the gallows. \n\n  These are test cases - the classification process is the\n\nsame for all - if the classification of one individual is ruled\n\nunconstitutional and set aside, all the other classifications could be\n\nruled null and void. \n\n  The motions filed on behalf on Albert Huntley, Frank Beckford and\n\nJunior Leslie by attorneys Richard Small, Dennis Daly and Enoch Blake,\n\nrespectively, contend that the classification procedure has contravened the\n\nmen\'s right to the protection of law and to a fair hearing because:-\n\n  The men were not given the opportunity to be heard in the\n\nproceedings in which the decision was made. \n\n  They were not given the opportunity to have a legal\n\nrepresentative of their choice. \n\n  They were not informed of the facts, material or questions consid\n\n<l> ered in the making of the decision. \n\n  The proceedings in or by which the said decision or determination\n\nwas made were not held or conducted in public. \n\n  The motions are set for hearing on March 1 1993.\n\n\ntions on behalf of several other Death Row prisoners are also pending.\n\n\n\n  The initial classifications were done by a single Court of Appeal\n\njudge on the basis of the transcript of the trial. \n\n  Justice Ira Rowe, President of the Court of Appeal, confirmed to\n\nthe  Gleaner  that all death row prisoners are entitled to\n\nrepresentation and legal aid, if necessary, when the original classifications\n\nare reviewed by the panel of three judges.\n He said failure of the constitutional motions will not make the\n\napplicants ineligible for review and there is also the right of appeal\n\nfrom the review decision.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  MACHINE and Allied Traders Ltd. and its director Richard Khouri\n\nwho are charged with evading customs duty of\n\n$310.000, yesterday failed to get the Full Court to bar a St. Andrew Resident\n\nMagistrate from trying the case. \n\n  They had also applied for an order to quash the informations on\n\nwhich they are to be tried, and this was also refused. \n\n  Investigations by the Revenue Protection Office Division, ( RPD)\n\nrevealed that the correct values in relation to the goods had not been\n\ndeclared by the applicants, who are also owners of Colour World Ltd. \n\n  Mr. Justice Bingham, Mr. Justice Clark and Mr. Justice Courtenay\n\nOrr, heard the applications.\n The applicants who are importers of and dealers in goods including\n\nphotographic equipment, paper, chemicals and accessories, were\n\ncharged in March 1992 under the Customs Act. \n\n  The Commissioner of Customs and Excise subsequently assigned Mr.\n\nLawrence May of the Revenue Protection Division of the Ministry of Finance to\n\ncarry out investigations in respect of the transactions. \n\n  The investigator found that due to fraudulent conduct on the part\n\nof the applicants, proper customs duties had not been paid.\n The Commissioner then authorised Mr. May to negotiate a\n\nmitigated penalty, but the parties did not agree to this. \n\n  On reviewing the information received from Mr. May, the\n\nCommissioner found that they had committed breaches of the Customs\n\nAct and advised the police that they should be charged. \n\n  Investigations also revealed that Khouri, who is also a director\n\nof Colour World Ltd., which is also associated with Machine and Allied\n\nTraders Ltd., had some of the goods shipped in the name of an entirely\n\nunrelated company, International Stationery Ltd., instead of in the name of\n\nthe companies.\n An original invoice in relation to those goods was said to have been\n\nfound in a garbage bin at Colour World Ltd. \n\n  The Full Court dismissed the applications and held that the\n\nCommissioner had acted properly within the four corners of the statute\n\nand had properly delegated to Mr. May the task of investigating the import\n\ntransactions involving the goods.\n The court also found that the Commissioner properly exercised\n\nhis discretion to commence proceedings against the applicants. \n\n  The applicants had contended that the Resident Magistrate for St.\n\nAndrew misinterpreted his jurisdiction in setting down the informa <l>\n\ntions for trial before him, because on the face of the information they\n\nalleged that the offences charged were committed in Kingston.\n The applicants were charged at the Half Way Tree police station, St.\n\nAndrew for the offences. \n\n  It was the court\'s finding that section 245 of the Customs Act\n\nwas framed in the alternative, thus enabling the prosecution to choose\n\nthe jurisdiction it relied on when framing the charges.\n case, it showed that the\n\nprosecution had elected to found jurisdiction in the place on land, where the\n\nalleged offenders were brought. \n\n  Attorney-at-law Enos Grant, instructed by the law firm\n\nClough, Long and Co. appeared for the applicants. \n\n  Attorneys-at-law Douglas Leys and Andrew Irving of the Attorney\n\nGeneral\'s Department, appeared for the Commissioner and the Minister of\n\nFinance who were the respondents.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  OPPOSITION spokesman on finance, Bruce Golding, has expressed\n\nconcern about the continued buoyancy of the stock market and has scored the\n\ngovernment for not moving to correct excess liquidity in the system. \n\n  " The level of investment is near zero despite this\n\nfeeling of calm that pervades the country,"  Mr. Golding told members\n\nof the Rotary Club of New Kingston at the Pegasus Hotel yesterday.', 'subdomain':

{'text': 'THERE is a ray of hope for students at the beginning of the new\n\nschool term in September. \n\n  Many of them will no longer be walking many miles to and from\n\nschool in sun and rain because of a lack of transportation. \n\n  Ten new school buses have been purchased by the Ministry of Edu\n\n<l> cation at a cost of more than\n\n$8 million and will be deployed to the routes across the island where\n\ntransportation for students is most needed. \n\n  The buses will be deployed along the following routes:- West Port\n\n<l> land ( Buff Bay region) to Port Antonio; Port Maria to Highgate;\n\nrural St. James; northern St. Ann and southern St. Ann; Portmore; upper St.\n\nCatherine; Northern Clarendon; and St. Thomas. \n\n  Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Education, Dr. Rae\n\nDavis, told the  Gleaner  that the five 52-seaters and five\n\n32-seater Tata minibuses were purchased from India with funds provided\n\nunder the Social and Economic Support Programme. \n\n  Dr. Davis said the buses were acquired after the studies carried\n\nout on different routes across the island and discussions held with Members\n\nof Parliament in the areas with the aim of identifying the critical areas\n\nwhere transportation for students was needed. \n\n  The buses were officially handed over to operators yesterday\n\nduring a ceremony at the Ministry. \n\n  Minister of Education, Burchell Whiteman, speaking at the ceremo\n\n<l> ny, said that the Ministry had always been concerned about the state\n\nof transportation for school children. \n\n  students\'\n\n education as many hours were lost during the time within which they had\n\nto walk or struggle on a minibus to get to school. \n\n  Although the cost of transportation would not be reduced\n\nwith the introduction of the buses, Mr. Whiteman said, it would alleviate the\n\nwear and tear which the students undergo in an effort to get to school. \n\n  He said the 10 buses represented a pilot scheme for a school\n\ntransportation system in Jamaica which if successful would signal great\n\npossibilities for the education system. \n\n  Dr. Davis said the buses would be leased to the 10 operators who\n\nwould be given a six-year period within which to complete payment for the\n\nvehicles. \n\n  Education Councils have been established to monitor the operation\n\nof the buses which will be allowed to operate as public passenger vehi <l>\n\ncles, for commercial purposes, during off-peak school hours and on\n\nholidays.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  A sum of\n\n$1.1 million from the United Nations Development Programme, and USAID, plus\n\nJ$7 million from this year\'s Budget, have been set aside for major work\n\non the Roaring River Supply Scheme in Westmoreland. \n\n  This was announced by Prime Minister P.J. Patterson yesterday on\n\na tour of the Roaring River domestic water supply treatment plant and\n\nthe typhoid-affected areas of Westmoreland. \n\n  The Prime Minister said that the J$7 million would be spent\n\nimmediately to safeguard all pipelines leading from the Roaring\n\nRiver to the respective communities, making sure that there was no broken\n\npipe-line.\n Those that must be lifted to ensure safety from contamination will be\n\nlifted, he said. \n\n  Efforts will also be made to ensure that the treatment of\n\nthe water was adequate and reliable.\n He said that from the reports he had received, he was not\n\nsatisfied with the level of attention to the management of the plant at\n\nRoaring River. \n\n \n " I have given clear instructions that capable people must be put in\n\ncharge and they must be constantly monitored; people must understand they\n\ncan\'t get paid to do a job and go to sleep, they must damn well do their\n\njobs, and if they don\'t do their job they must be subject to discipline\n\nand they must be fired, and put people in place who will do the job.\n\n  " I am not prepared to have the health of vast communities put at\n\nrisk because people are not performing their duties,"  the Prime\n\nMinister said. \n\n  He announced the provision of 1,000 sealed-bottom pit toilets for\n\nthe Roaring River area which he said is a continued programme which was\n\nalready started.\n He also announced a long-term plan for proper sanitary facilities for\n\nthe tourist attraction at Roaring River. \n\n  The touring party did not visit the Shrewsbury Housing Scheme\n\nsewage treatment plant which is a possible source of the spread of typhoid in\n\nthe Roaring River area and has been without a standby generator for over four\n\nyears thus causing untreated sewage to enter the river when there is a power\n\ncut.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  IN a continuing effort to curtail the commercial banking ac\n\n<l> tivities of the Bank of Jamaica ( BoJ), a substantial number of Gov\n\n<l> ernment accounts have been transferred to the commercial banking sec <l>\n\ntor. \n\n  has been reliably informed that the\n\nGovernment made no attempt to use its  \'muscle\'  to\n\nobtain preferential terms from the commercial banks, for its Ministries.\n In addition, a strongly-worded letter from the Ministry of Finance\n\nprohibited the banks from extending overdraft facilities to any of these\n\nMinistries. \n\n  This move is seen as part of the Government\'s continued efforts\n\nto streamline its operations and to return the BoJ to its role as central\n\nbanker.\n Just two weeks ago it was reported by this newspaper that debt\n\nmanagement operations carried out by the BoJ were being returned to the\n\nMinistry of Finance. \n\n  The move was confirmed by Dr. Owen Jefferson, senior deputy gov\n\n<l> ernor of the BoJ in an interview with the  Gleaner  yesterday.\n\n\n\n \n " A number of operating accounts of Ministries have been transferred\n\nto the commercial sector.\n Dr.\n\nJefferson said. \n\n  understands that chief among these is the\n\npayroll account operated by the Accountant-General Department, but Dr.\n\nJefferson said he was unable to say what accounts for which Ministries and\n\nhow many were actually involved. \n\n \n\n  However, some accounts such as the Consolidated Fund, Revenue and\n\nLoan accounts still remain with the Central Bank.\n The funds for each Ministry and Department would be transferred from\n\nthese accounts into the relevant comercial bank accounts. \n\n  Dr. Jefferson stressed that the move would be good for members of\n\nthe public who had to form long lines at the Bank in order to get their\n\ncheques cashed. \n\n  " Cashing with the BoJ does not afford anybody any\n\nprivilege and it certainly is inconvenient having to leave Constant Spring to\n\ncome all the way downtown,"  he said. \n\n  understands that several commercial banks\n\nhave benefited from this move but was unable yesterday to find out how many\n\nbanks got accounts and which Ministries took their accounts where. \n\n  Among the banks acquiring some of these accounts are the National\n\nCommercial Bank ( NCB), Workers Bank, CIBC ( Jamaica) Limited and Mutual\n\nSecurity Bank. \n\n  Bankers Association president, Douglas Folkes, said there was\n\nnothing strange about the decision.\n He said it probably came out of a desire to spread the Government\n\nbusiness around in the commercial banking sector as well as because of\n\nconvenience in terms of location. \n\n  " It was the Government\'s intention to place some of\n\nits business with the commercial banks and move it out of the Bank of\n\nJamaica, but I can\'t say to what extent the exercise has been completed,"\n\n he said. \n\n  Several accounts, such as the Central Government\'s travelling ac\n\n<l> count which is with NCB, were long held within the commercial banking\n\nsector.\n Several Ministries and Government Departments, as well as\n\nstatutory bodies such as the Jamaica Public Service, Air Jamaica, the\n\nPlanning Institute of Jamaica, National Water Commission and Petrojam\n\nalso held their main accounts with the commercial banks. \n\n  NCB is the main banker for JPS which also operates accounts with\n\nthe BNS, Century National and CIBC, BNS is the main banker for both the NWC\n\nand Air Jamaica.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  A bid is being made in the Caribbean community for the\n\nsending of a unified Commonwealth Caribbean team to future Olympic Games, but\n\nJamaica is opposed to the idea. \n\n  Teddy McCook, president of the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Associa\n\n<l> tion ( JAAA), gave Jamaica\'s view on the proposal when he took part in a\n\nrecent CanaRadio  \'Cross-fire\'  programme.\n He opposed the idea on the ground that the team might not necessarily\n\nbe stronger and might hamper the  preparation. \n\n \n\n \n\n  In the wake of more dismal performances by Caribbean\n\nCommunity countries at the recent Barcelona Olympics, renewed calls are being\n\nmade for a unified team to represent the region in future Games.\n\n \n\n  Panellists on a recent Cana Radio \'Cross-fire\' programme,\n\nwhich reviewed the 25th Olympiad, generally supported the idea of\n\nunified regional representation at the Olympics. \n\n  Among the panellists were president of the Guyana Boxing\n\nBoard of Control, Frederick Ramprashad; president of the Jamaica Amateur\n\nAthletic Association, Teddy Mc-Cook; former Barbados Olympian, Freida\n\nNicholls; and Barbadian sportscaster Erskine King.\n\n\n  Nicholls, a former Barbados sprinter, said she supported a uni\n\n<l> fied team, noting that a West Indies team had competed in the 1960\n\nOlympics. \n\n \n " I think that you are not necessarily going to find a stronger team\n\nwith a unified team&dotted-line;\n As a matter of fact, such a team could have a great effect on the\n\npreparation, the participation and the potential for development in the\n\nregion,"  McCook said. \n\n  " I do not see a unified team as something that will spin\n\nas far as Jamaica is concerned,"  he added.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  MEMBERS of the Jamaica Teachers\' Association ( JTA) are\n\ndemanding a 100% increase in salary, concessionary rates on the\n\nduty for motor vehicles, as well as a pension payment of 50% of the salary at\n\nthe time of retirement. \n\n  Those were among the many financial matters raised yesterday\n\nduring the 28th annual conference of the JTA which concludes today at the\n\nAmericana Beach Resort Hotel, Ocho Rios. \n\n  As one of the claims being submitted before the Salaries\n\nReview Committee set up recently by the Government, the JTA is also asking\n\nthat the Government improve its contribution to its revolving car loan fund\n\nfor teachers.\n The fund now stands at\n\n$2M.  The teachers are asking that it be increased to\n\n$8M. \n\n  The teachers are also asking that they be represented on the\n\nGovernment\'s committee that recommends adjustment to pensions.\n Furthermore, the group is demanding that Government-approved\n\nstudy leave be considered pensionable service. \n\n  The JTA had last year secured a two-year salary agreement in\n\nwhich salaries would be increased by 38,5% in 1991 and 55% in 1992. \n\n  However, with the removal of wage guidelines and the creation of\n\nthe Salary Review Committee the JTA are arguing for a 100% increase in\n\nthe salary scales for the current year and the new two-year contract period\n\n1993/4. \n\n  If salaries are increased during the current year, a Principal\n\nfrom a tertiary institution which is rated Grade A could carry home between\n\n$281,028 -\n\n$323,736 per annum ( up from\n\n$124,901 -\n\n$143,883).  At the middle level of the salary scale, a graduate with a\n\nteachers\' diploma could receive\n\n$80,028 -\n\n$92,556 per annum ( up from\n\n$40,014 -\n\n$46,278).  trained teacher could\n\nexpect to earn between\n\n$59,142 - 65,910 per year ( up from\n\n$29,571 -\n\n$32,955 per annum). \n\n \n\n  &bullet; material and equipment allow<lance of\n\n$25,000 ( up from\n\n$6,050 to\n\n$9,900) per annum \n\n  &bullet; uniform and equipment allowance of\n\n$8000 ( up from\n\n$500 to\n\n$1,848) per annum \n\n  &bullet; laundry allowance of\n\n$5,000 per annum ( up from\n\n$1,476). \n\n  Claims related to housing allowance include: for all teachers an\n\nallowance of\n\n$500 per month. \n\n  However, Heads of Department at level 1 Grade will get a housing\n\nallowances similar to their counterparts in the Civil Service. \n\n  Principals, Vice-principals and Heads of Departments at the level\n\n2 Grade would receive housing allowance similar to their counterparts in\n\nthe Civil Service. \n\n  Other allowances include the introduction of a lunch subsidy of\n\n$30 per working day and a utility allowance of\n\n$36,000 per annum.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '4ebc0aa8-f1f6-4b57-9842-f30d9d1ec554', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.451184+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9784074425697327, 'non_english_score': 0.021592557430267334}
{'text': 'Trinis out; Jamaica advance to second round of World Cup\n\nqualifying football  \n\n \n\n  PLAYING before a capacity crowd of 35,000, which included Prime\n\nMinister P.J. Patterson, Jamaica held arch rivals Trinidad and Tobago to a\n\n1-1 draw at the National Stadium last night to advance to the second round of\n\nthe Central American and Caribbean region ( CONCACAF) World Cup qualifying\n\nzone. \n\n  Jamaica won the home and away tie 3-2 after defeating the\n\nTrinidadians 2-1 in the first leg on July 5, in Port of Spain. \n\n  Paul Davis sent the home crowd, which had braved late morning and\n\nmid-afternoon showers, in a frenzied, flag-waving celebration in the 28th\n\nminute when he scored after a solo effort on the right.\n Twelve minutes later Bryan Haynes, a United States based profession\n\n<l> al, equalised for Trinidad and Tobago. \n\n  Jamaica now join Bermuda, El Salvador and Canada in CONCACAF\n\nGroup \'B\' for a round-robin tournament.\n The top two teams from this group will go forward along with two from\n\nCONCACAF Group A. \n\n  Things went according to plan for national coach Carl Brown and\n\nhe was full of praise after the game. \n\n \n Brown said after the\n\nmatch. \n " Paul Davis must be credited for this, I was a little worried when\n\nTrinidad and Tobago equalised but we have the best defence in the Caribbean\n\nand I knew we would have held on."  \n\n  Trinidad\'s national coach, Muhammad Isa, also praised the Ja\n\n<l> maican team. \n\n\nIsa said. \n " I thought that there weren\'t many chances created and our team\n\nlacked aggression."  \n\n \n\n  Rain which forced the game to be set back for half hour, stopped\n\nshortly after the opening whistle and both teams settled quickly on the damp\n\nfield. \n\n  Trinidad used the wings well in the opening minutes with defender\n\nMarvin Faustin enjoying a number of clear runs on the left side of the field.\n Jamaica weathered the storm and must have gained some confidence\n\nwhen goalkeeper Warren Barrett went low to hold a scorching 30-yard drive by\n\nthe big Trinidad and Tobago defender Shawn Boney. \n\n  The first hint of things to come for the home team came in the\n\n15th minute when Linval Wilson\'s cross from the left was neatly controlled\n\nand volleyed just over the bar by Peter Isaacs. \n\n  The early action was concentrated a lot in midfield as\n\nJamaica, with a five-man defence line-up, kept out the Trinidadians with firm\n\nand hard tackling.\n Winston Anglin kept a close watch on Trinidad\'s diminutive ball\n\nartist Russell Latapy, while the bald- headed Mark Wilson allowed no\n\nbreathing space to the Aston Villa\'s professional Dwight Yorke. \n\n  Isaacs again showed his value to the team mid-way the half with a\n\n30-yard diagonal run which ended with a torrid left foot shot going just\n\nwide. \n\n  Davis, as he did a year ago in the Shell Cup final, rose to the\n\noccasion again.\n Collecting a pass from defender Barrington Gaynor he turned on a\n\nfeeble tackle from Boney and with the Trinidad and Tobago defence slow\n\nto react Davis beat a diving Michael Maurice with a well-placed shot.\n The ball hitting the inside of the far post before lodging in the\n\nback of the net. \n\n  Trinidad did not have to wait long for the equaliser.\n Latapy shook off his marker on the right and left the crowded\n\nJamaican defence in shambles before lobbing to the far post where Haynes\n\nscored a regulation header in the 40th minute. \n\n  Except for the occasional counter attack the second half was one\n\nof survival for Jamaica.\n It was the home team, however, which came closest to scoring twice in\n\nthe half. \n\n  header, from a\n\nPeter Cargill free- kick, hit the cross-bar and rebounded into play.\n attack,\n\ncame face to face with Maurice but the goalkeeper, from point  - \n\nblank range parried for a corner. \n\n  In between these two chances Yorke\'s header at the far post was\n\nmagnificently saved low down by a diving Warren Barrett in the Jamaica\n\ngoal.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  More dirt means more money.\n At least that\'s the way it is in the janitorial services business,,\n\nwhich has grown steadily in recent years. \n\n  The five or six prominent janitorial services available\n\nabout ten years ago have been joined by several times their number.\n "\n\nYellow Pages"  .\n Coupled with the smaller unlisted establishments, the number of\n\njanitorial services is now, according to experts in the business, well\n\nover 60. \n\n  But the well-established firms are holding their ground, or\n\nsquare feet of space, as the competition grows.\n Most believe that the business will not only survive, but\n\nthrive. \n\n \n said Archalaus Lennon,\n\nindustrial relations manager for Temps Ltd., among the oldest janitorial\n\nservices in the country. \n " But business is good.\n\n\n  The more recent additions to the industry agree that there is\n\nroom in the market for everyone who can offer an efficient service. \n\n \n said Lauren Lewis, managing\n\ndirector of Lauren Enterprises, which has been in business since 1989.\n\n\n\n\n  It should get even better, judging from the continuous surge in\n\nthe number of buildings being constructed.\n For example, the Kingston and St. Andrew Corporation ( KSAC) approved\n\nwell over 600 building applications since April 1.\n Although the approvals do not necessarily mean the buildings will be\n\nconstructed immediately, it does mean people are interested in building,\n\nthereby providing the potential for further growth in the need for jani <l>\n\ntorial services. \n\n \n " Jamaica has grown considerably since the 1960s and there is just a\n\ngreater demand for services,"  said David Minott, director of Minott\n\nServices Ltd. \n\n  Minott Services is one of the older establishments, and along\n\nwith Temps, are among those which started out in another line of business,\n\nbefore branching into janitorial services.\n The trend has become more common.\n Minott Services started around 1960 as National Community\n\nService, a garbage collection business.\n The name was changed by the mid-1960s, and in 1970 the business\n\nstarted to offer janitorial services. \n\n  Temps started out 30 years ago as a placement service, under the\n\nname Manpower Jamaica Ltd.\n But in the 1970s the name was changed to Temps, and by 1974 it was\n\nalso into janitorial services.\n Today there is another business, Manpower and Maintenance Services,\n\nlisted in the directory under janitor service. \n\n \n\n  But despite the influx of several new players, the major market\n\nshare is still dominated by a few big names, including Minott Services, Temps\n\nand Office Services Ltd.\n Those companies control the larger contracts, for example banks,\n\nmajor office buildings, hospitals and factories. \n\n  Some, like Minott Services, do not take jobs which offer less\n\nthan 10,000 square feet of space to clean, because they say it would not be\n\neconomically viable.\n The company currently has contracts to cover about 1,000,000\n\nsquare feet of space. \n\n  Other established firms, like Temps, handle jobs of all sizes,\n\nbut restructure their fee system according to size of the job.\n For the larger jobs, for example those over 5,000 square feet, the\n\nrate is based on the size of the space.\n A costing system is applied for smaller jobs, before mark-up is\n\nadded. \n\n  Industry sources claim that rates range between 60 cents and one\n\ndollar per square feet.\n based on the type of the job needed.\n For example, different rates would apply to clean and maintain a\n\nfactory than an office building.\n But the survival of a janitorial service relies more on its\n\nreputation for efficiency, rather than the rate it charges. \n\n \n\n \n " Once you are in the business you have to maintain a high standard\n\nto keep that business,"  said Ruth Gaynor, manager of RCG\n\nMaintenance Service Ltd., which started in 1982. \n\n  But all is not squeaky clean.\n The high cost of equipment and the uncertainties that affect labour\n\nintensive businesses can cause difficulties.\n Some companies import equipment, while others purchase locally.\n\n\n  For example, an automatic scrubber costs about\n\n$172,000.  The machine is guaranteed to operate effectively for about\n\ntwo years due to heavy use.\n A high speed buffer, costing\n\n$72,600, will last about four years. \n\n  Wages for labourers can also be a setback.\n The workers who clean and maintain buildings are usually contracted\n\non a part-time basis, and cannot command full-time pay. \n\n  Those difficulties have caused some services to fold.\n But most experts in the business agree that those who continue\n\nto perform efficiently have little to worry about.\n More people will turn to janitorial services, they say, because they\n\nappreciate clean surroundings and are willing to pay for it. \n\n \n said Marcia Johnson,\n\noperations manager for Minott Services. \n " Buildings are always going up.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  CHAOS and confusion reigned at the National Stadium yesterday\n\namid Jamaica\'s advance to the second round of the World Cup football\n\ncompetition. \n\n  Thousands of spectators gathered outside the stadium from be\n\n<l> fore 1 p.m., and even heavy showers failed to deter them from\n\ngetting inside. \n\n  But thousands were still left standing outside, some trying to\n\nfight their way in at five o\'clock when the match started, 30 minutes\n\nlater than the original kick off time. \n\n  to get\n\ntickets from a lone omnibus used as the official ticket office.\n The scene resembled a noisy, crowded market with prospective\n\nbuyers all trying to make their purchase at the same time. \n\n  It was one of those days when there were too few hands to meet\n\nthe ticket sales demand. \n\n  Security guards struggled to control dogs under their\n\ncommand, probably frightened by the large crowd, while spectators bore their\n\nway through gates reserved for officials when the dignitaries passed\n\nthrough. \n\n  At 4:45 the stadium had a capacity crowd. Seventeen minutes\n\nlater when the first whistle was sounded, over 30,000 were seeing the making\n\nof history - the first time a World Cup match was being played between\n\nthe two nations on Jamaican soil. \n\n  No Carnival or Reggae Sunsplash cheers could match those of the\n\nsupportive Jamaica crowd when their local heroes surged goalwards with the\n\nball. \n\n  A mini, man-made earth tremor shook the ground when local idol\n\nPaul " Tegat" Davis stabbed the ball past Trinidad and Tobago\'s custodi <l>\n\nan, Michael Maurice, and Jamaica were 3-1 up on aggregate after 28 minutes.\n\n\n\n  However, a Brian Haynes equalising goal 12 minutes later\n\nbrought on a hush inside the stadium and for the first time it was evident\n\nthat there were supporters other than Jamaicans inside the stadium. \n\n  The cheers of the small Trinidad and Tobago contingent were soon\n\ndrowned in those of the home crowd with the sound of the half-time whistle.\n\n\n\n  A tense atmosphere prevailed as Jamaica went on the defensive\n\nfor most of the second half. It was the first time in a long while that the\n\ncrowd, those of whom had seats, sat glue until the end. \n\n  All tension was relieved when Mexican referee Jose Ramirez blew\n\nthe final whistle, catapulting Jamaica a step further to qualification\n\nfor the 1994 tournament in the United States.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  A decision has been made to relocate sidewalk and\n\nstreetside vendors operating in sections of Kingston by Monday,\n\nSeptember 14. \n\n  This decision was announced during a meeting of the Vendors\n\nImprovement Programme ( VIP) held on Thursday at the Hotel Oceana, downtown\n\nKingston. \n\n  VIP has been organised by Metropolitan Parks and Markets\n\nand the Kingston Central Police Civic Committee as an attempt to remove\n\nvendors from sidewalks and street sides and to facilitate their comer <l>\n\ncial activity in legal vending areas. \n\n  VIP is an initiative which was launched early last year, but fal\n\n<l> tered because of an inadequate organisational structure.\n\n\n  For Thursday\'s meeting, VIP organisers co-opted members\n\nfrom the Jamaica Vendors, Higglers and Markets Association ( JVHMA), the\n\nJamaica Chamber of Commerce, the Kingston Restoration Company, and the City\n\nCentre Police Station.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '7e27d718-ba22-4b6b-a25d-9b572d20d806', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.452480+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9696244597434998, 'non_english_score': 0.030375540256500244}
{'text': 'UNSUSPECTING ICAS code customers could be starting at whopping\n\ntelephone bills within the next few weeks, following a breakdown in the\n\nprotection system at the Jamaica Telephone Company ( JTC) about two months\n\nago, and widespread illegal use of codes. \n\n  understands that during an exercise\n\nto upgrade certain systems at the JTC, the threshold system which protects\n\nowners of the International Call Authorisation System ( ICAS) codes from\n\nfraudulent code use, broke down.\n As a result, the illegal use of some codes continued without\n\nrestriction for about two months. \n\n  But customers with codes, which were used illegally during that\n\nperiod, may not discover the rampant abuse of their codes until their bills,\n\nwhich are prepared by computer, arrive within the next few weeks.\n The cost amassed from those illegal calls won\'t be known before then.\n\n\n\n  The threshold system allows ICAS customers to restrict the amount\n\nof overseas calls made by that code over any specific period.\n For example, a customer may request two overseas calls per day.\n The code will not work if more than two calls are made for the day.\n Customers would then have to call the JTC to have the code\n\nreactivated.\n But unsuspecting customers would not necessarily know they needed to\n\ncall the JTC if the threshold system was not in service. \n\n  The JTC has about 130,000 telephone customers.\n About 90,000 own ICAS codes.\n could not ascertain how many of those\n\ncodes were abused during the breakdown.\n But between 1,500 and 2,000 codes have been used illegally since\n\n1989, according to the JTC. \n\n \n\n  Weeks of investigation revealed that illegal use of ICAS codes\n\nstepped up dramatically during recent months.\n Codes were easily available on streets all over the island, but\n\nmainly in the Corporate Area.\n Some codes were passed on without charge, others sold for up to\n\n$400.  Persons were seen with several functioning codes at one time.\n\n\n\n  But the JTC has not officially acknowledged the threshold system\n\nbreakdown.\n contacted the JTC on July 22,\n\npublic relations manager Errol Miller said the number of illegal overseas\n\ncalls had  " dropped dramatically"  , since ICAS was\n\nintroduced in August 1989, and that there had been  " no significant\n\nincrease this year"  in the illegal use of codes as compared to last\n\nyear. \n\n \n\n\n  The company also maintains that most problems with ICAS fraud\n\nstem from customer negligence. \n\n \n " The problems we have experienced arise primarily from customers who\n\nhave been in some way or form negligent with ICAS codes,"  said Mark\n\nJohnson, vice president of the JTC\'s Network Fraud Control. \n\n \n\n \n\nSunday Gleaner  that no special police unit was currently assigned to\n\ninvestigate ICAS fraud.\n However, he added that there were reports that codes were being sold\n\nillegally, even outside the JTC office at Duke Street. \n\n  But following persistent requests for additional information,\n\nincluding a check with Mr. Johnson, the  Sunday Gleaner  was told by\n\nthe JTC to submit a written list of questions.\n\n\n  Sunday\n\nGleaner  for 7:30 a.m. the following day.\n During Thursday\'s meeting Mr. Johnson and JTC senior public relations\n\nofficer Ann Astwood answered several questions about the ICAS system on tape\n\nand granted permission for a reporter to take notes.\n Everald Edwards, another JTC public relations officer, was also\n\npresent at the meeting. \n\n  When told about evidence of widespread illegal use of ICAS codes\n\nMr. Johnson said: \n " I\'m not going to dispute that.\n\n\n  Mr. Johnson then requested that the tape be turned off.\n That request was granted after Mr. Johnson and Mrs. Astwood promised\n\nto offer explanations about the recent upsurge of illegal code use.\n For the sake of accuracy on the part of the JTC, they said, the\n\nexplanation would be written and submitted to the Sunday Gleaner later that\n\nday.\n Mr. Johnson then proceeded to explain the breakdown in the JTC\n\nsystem. \n\n  Sunday\n\nGleaner  on Thursday.\n After repeated calls to the offices of both Mrs. Astwood and Mr.\n\nJohnson, between Thursday afternoon and Friday, a bearer delivered a letter\n\nto the Gleaner office at 3:30 p.m. Friday. \n\n  The letter did not include any information about the threshold\n\nsystem breakdown, as promised by Mr. Johnson and Mrs. Astwood.\n " the availability of exposed\n\ncodes becomes especially pronounced during the summer months."  \n\n  The JTC introduced ICAS to combat widespread problems with clip\n\non calls ( illegal connections).\n The company lost approximately\n\n$70 million for illegal calls per year before ICAS.\n Last year, the company lost approximately\n\n$1,2 million.\n "\n\neffective security system which continues to work in the manner for which it\n\nwas designed."   \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Rape, drug-peddling, mugging and murders have become a part of\n\nthe daily life of St. William Grant Park, formerly Victoria Park. \n\n  In the daytime it is teeming with life.\n At midnight, after Metropolitan Parks and Markets Ltd. ( MPM) have\n\nordered the gates closed, many are still hidden in trees and among shrubs.\n \'Sodom\n\nand Gomorrah\'  , according to an elderly, homeless man, who was seen\n\nsitting on the side of the fountain, shaving. \n\n  St. William Grant Park, once a place where one used to go for\n\nmeditation, trash out arguments and to watch children play or where lovers\n\nheld hands, has become a haven for the many homeless... thugs, rapists,\n\ndrug-users, muggers and even would-be murderers. \n\n  As the old man scraped at his chin with the dull blade, his eyes\n\nbore the misery of the tales he told. \n\n \n " I was born in Kingston and used to come here when it was Victoria\n\nPark,"  he said. \n\n\n to happen. \n Dem rape the poor woman dem, every night dem drag them over here and\n\nrape them.\n he said,\n\nshaking his head. \n\n  Like all the other homeless, he has been living in the park for\n\nmore than three years, ever since the house he used to live in was destroyed\n\nby fire. \n\n  Even the very young have been targeted.\n A nine-year-old boy was raped and killed there.\n According to his sister, Donna Brown, with whom he was living, he had\n\nbeen missing from home for a few days and the next time she saw him was when\n\nshe was called to identify the body in the park.\n\n\n  But it is the story of a 17-year-old who sleeps there that is\n\nmost shocking.\n She has been raped no less than 12 times, on several occasions by\n\nmore than five men.\n Emaciated, unkempt and with uncombed hair, her sad, faraway eyes\n\nmirror anguish and pain.\n\n\n  She said she ran away from her home in the country more than\n\nseven months ago after abandoning her new-born baby in a toilet. \n\n  \n she said, her eyes\n\npleading for understanding.  \n " Is one day me belly was hurting and me go in the toilet and the\n\nbaby come down.\n Then when me go in the house mi uncle go in de toilet and see it and\n\nsey me can\'t stay there."   \n\n  Her aunt gave her\n\n$20 and an address to come to Kingston to her mother.\n But she is unable to find her; she has not seen her since she was 10\n\nyears old.\n The teenager got off the bus at Parade not knowing what to do.\n Still feeling sick from her recent childbirth, she was raped the\n\nsecond night by two men. \n\n  After a few days of hunger, she sought, and got a job helping a\n\nhiggler in the market, in return for food.\n But at nights, with nowhere to go, she roams the streets until it is\n\ntime to scale the wall and join the other homeless in the park.\n She has found a secret bed where she hopes she will be safe until day\n\ndawns.\n She really wants to go back home but the crime she has committed back\n\nin her tiny village is unforgivable.\n As she told her story, she pointed to a nearby wall where she saw\n\nanother young girl being raped one night. \n\n \n\n  The park is not without its share of murders, the most recent\n\nbeing correctional officer Linden Powell of a Delacree Park address, who was\n\nshot and killed in June in one of the bathrooms and his firearm taken. \n\n  Not too long ago, a homeless man, Jack Williams, a Nigerian, who\n\nmade his home in a tree there, was allegedly shot in the face by a policeman.\n\n\n\n  There are daily fights with deadly weapons and the use of drugs\n\nhas become commonplace. \n\n  Ganja smoking is rife.\n Young men sitting under the famous Banyan tree smoke spliffs.\n The air is heavy with the pungent smell of the weed.\n People attending prayer meetings nearby inhale the scent but dare not\n\nsay anything. \n\n  In 1987 the Victoria Park was transformed into a thing of beauty.\n The layout provides public bathroom facilities; sandpit - children\n\nplaying area; paved concrete walkways; convenient seating areas; wrought iron\n\nornamentals laid out to enhance foliage and flowers.\n Millions of dollars was pumped into the park making it a showpiece in\n\nthe Caribbean. \n\n  It was the then Prime Minister, Edward Seaga\'s dream that the\n\npark would be developed into an entertainment centre for exposing budding\n\nartistes in music, poetry, sculpture and drama.\n The stages are still there, the infrastructure in place, but that\n\ndream is still to become a reality. \n\n  Today, lovers rendezvous there daily.\n In the shade of the main walkways, hawkers peddle their wares -\n\nshrimps, bag juice, biscuits and sweets, cigarettes - anything cheap enough\n\nto attract the fast moving crowd on their way to catch the buses at North and\n\nSouth Parade.\n Most pedlars sit quietly not really bawling out their goods.\n All around sinister-looking photographers cajole young couples, the\n\nproud, the aspiring beauties and the fashion conscious into taking\n\nphotographs. \n\n  In trees, on the walls near the depressing stench of the\n\nlavatories, all around what was once beautifully land-scaped lawns and\n\ngardens, scores of young men sit among broken ferns and rose bushes still\n\nstanding majestically, fighting the odds - loitering, gambling, playing music\n\nor having boisterous arguments spiced with expletives. \n\n  The fountain, once a thing of beauty, has lost its attraction.\n There is no fresh spray of water spurting up in the air.\n Instead at the bottom of the pool are piles of garbage amid the\n\nstagnant, slimy, green water, filled with mosquito larvae. \n\n  This is St. William Grant Park... no longer serving the purpose\n\nfor which it was created.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n went the ad.\n\n\n  Many wondered if this was really a marriage proposal. Many\n\nthought it was just a gimmick. \n\n  But Christopher Alexander, the man who placed the ad on page 28\n\nof last Friday\'s  Gleaner  was deadly serious in his marriage\n\nproposal to long-time love and business partner Denise Heffes, owner of the\n\nSpunk line of swimwear. \n\n  Asked why he chose this way to make his proposal as against the\n\nmore conventional idea of dinner and wine in a nice restaurant, Mr. Alexander\n\nsaid it was a mixture of things.\n First there was fear, he did not know how he could ask her face to\n\nface and knew she would never take the initiative; then he wanted to avoid\n\nroutine, eating out was the norm rather than the exception for the couple.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '0420e242-6aec-4fc2-977a-13c45fcad275', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.453757+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9829984307289124, 'non_english_score': 0.017001569271087646}
{'text': 'VIOLENCE in Jamaica goes back to the movement of slaves from West\n\nAfrica.\n The theory is linked to those slaves off-loaded in Jamaica because\n\nthey were rebellious on the trip and it was the first opportunity to off-load\n\nthem. \n\n  That was the explanation given by Jamaican-born Toronto Detective\n\nDave McLeod during an interview with that country\'s  Globe and Mail \n\nnewspaper about Jamaica\'s crime wave and the criminal sub  -  culture\n\nwhich the paper said has been exported to Canada. \n\n \n " Jamaicans are commonly characterised as not taking any crap, as\n\nbeing aggressive, and for the most part if you were to compare the Jamaicans\n\nto other people in the West Indies, there is a pattern:\n Det.\n\nMcLeod said. \n\n \n " The Maroons ( slaves who fled to the mountains after the British\n\nousted the Spaniards; the    name   derives from\n\nthe word  Cimarron  , meaning wild) have always been the\n\ndefiant group, the ones who were able to organise the slaves from the other\n\nislands,"  Det. McLeod said. \n\n  reporter Timothy\n\nAppleby who visited West Kingston\'s  " battered streets and shanty\n\ntowns"  and found the toughest slums in the Caribbean, pulsating with\n\nlife and the threat of death after dark. \n\n \n\nin July, Appleby looked at how routine violent crime had become in Jamaica\n\nand how it had spilled over onto Canadian streets; how in Jamaica the sight\n\nof a police uniform provokes fear, and the exportation of that apprehension\n\nto Jamaican-Canadian youth. \n\n \n\n  He also took an indepth look at the link between crime, politics,\n\nposses and drugs; shortcomings of the Jamaica Constabulary Force, the\n\nfriction between Jamaicans and police in Jamaica and North America; crisis in\n\npublic confidence of the police, senior police involvement in corruption\n\nincluding drug-running, and the limited resources available to the police.\n\n\n\n  Appleby went back to Canada and found Trinidadians, Barbadians,\n\nGuyanese among others, blaming a minority of Jamaicans for the violence in\n\nthe black community.\n He also found there was a group of young Jamaican males which, in the\n\npast three years, has altered Toronto\'s criminal landscape significantly in\n\nan explosion of guns and crack cocaine. \n\n  Globe and\n\nMail  said. \n " For example, its annual homicide rate of about 18 for every 100,000\n\nof its 2.4 million people is almost twice the U.S. rate and six times\n\nCanada\'s.  \n\n  " if Jamaicans are strongly associated\n\nwith Metro Toronto\'s black crime, it\'s not surprising, in that they\n\nconstitute at least half of the black community.\n Most estimates, however, indicate they are responsible for far more\n\nthan 50 per cent of the black crime mosaic.\n And the most ominous signal of all, perhaps, is that as far as can be\n\ngauged the bulk of the young Jamaicans being arrested were not born in\n\nJamaica, but in Canada."  \n\n  While many of the young Jamaicans arrested in Metro originate in\n\nthe Kingston area, others, possibly a majority, were born in Canada. \n\n \n\n  One explanation for the increase in violence in Kingston, is the\n\nentrenchment of crack cocaine. \n\n  The newspaper also pointed out that every year the Jamaican\n\npolice kill more than 200 people.\n Two-thirds of those slayings occur in the Kingston area, usually with\n\nhigh  -  powered rifles in what are almost invariably described as\n\nshootouts, said the newspaper, under the headline: \n\n\n \n " If the police chase a gunman and he jumps over a fence and is gone,\n\nand he ( the policeman) sees you - boom, you\'re gone,"  said Donovan\n\nMullins, a 20-year- old unemployed carpenter who lives in impoverished Trench\n\nTown. \n\n  said police heavy-handedness in\n\n " one of the world\'s most violent cultures"  had been\n\ndocumented for years by Amnesty International and the U.S. human rights group\n\nAmericas Watch.\n But critics contend the abuses go far beyond heavy-handedness, to\n\ninclude torture, wholescale corruption and complicity in the drug trade. \n\n  Crime among Jamaicans in Toronto worries black leaders there and\n\nthey say it had the potential of creating a rift in the black community.\n\n\n " It\'s making a lot of us West Indians say \'I\'m not Jamaican\',"\n\n said Lennox Farrell, Black Action Defence Committee member. \n\n  A destabilizer, the newspaper said, is the fierce social\n\ndivisions created by Jamaica\'s political polarization - the all-encompassing\n\ngulf between the People\'s National Party and the Jamaica Labour Party which\n\nin the past has turned Kingston into a battleground. \n\n \n " Even today, there are some PNP people here in Toronto who will not\n\ncross Eglington Avenue,"  Mr. Farell explained. \n\n  If a disproportionate number of Jamaicans are rebelling, it is\n\nbecause  " Jamaicans are not used to taking crap,"  said\n\nTrinidad-born publisher Arnold Auguste. \n " If you want to pick on a community that\'s the worst one to pick on\n\nbecause they\'ll fight back.\n\n\n  " Jamaican crime is\n\nsignificant.\n In terms of violent crime, I don\'t think there\'s another group that\n\nhas a bigger impact on the streets right now."  \n\n  Police and others warned that a major caveat was that other\n\nblacks emulate the proud, no-nonsense Jamaican culture and mannerisms. \n\n  But Barbadian-born college professor Netto Kefenise said\n\nJamaicans were not the only ones committing crime. \n " I\'m sure that Trinidadians, Barbadians and Guyanese are all\n\ncommitting crimes as well.\n It\'s just that it\'s predominantly Jamaican, and, in the long run, the\n\nlarger public will not see the difference,"  he said.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  JAMAICA\'s position that Caribbean Basin Initiative ( CBI)\n\ncountries should be accorded similar treatment to those NAFTA signatories are\n\nto get has the backing of the powerful and highly influential United States\n\nApparel Industry Council ( USAIC). \n\n \n\n" immediate parity"  be provided to CBI countries for  "\n\npreferences given to Mexico in relation to trade in textiles and apparel\n\nunder the NAFTA".  \n\n  In welcoming the conclusion of the North American Free Trade\n\nAgreement ( NAFTA) between United States, Canada and Mexico, which makes the\n\n360-million,\n\n$6 trillion-strong group the largest trading bloc in the world, the USAIC\n\nsounded the warning that  " failure to provide parity will cause CBI\n\ncountries to lose current investment and investment opportunities." \n\n\n\n  " US apparel\n\ncompany investments in the CBI region will be jeopardised if immediate parity\n\nis not provided."  \n\n  The statement from this highly influential US apparel lobby group\n\nrepresents a boost to the position of Caribbean Basin apparel interests.\n Jamaica\'s Chief Trade Representative and JAMPRO Vice President for\n\nInternational Marketing and Trade, Ambassador Peter King, has been a main\n\nspokesman for CBI apparel interests and has done considerable lobbying in\n\nimportant capitals for the industry, often emphasizing the same points\n\nmentioned by the USAIC. \n\n  Delighted that his lobbying work has borne fruit, he said he was\n\npleased at the goodwill and support expressed by the statement of the USAIC.\n\n\n\n  On Thursday morning, Ambassador King received the Mexican\n\nAmbassador to Jamaica, Sr. Luis Ortiz Monasterio.\n The two ambassadors discussed the recently concluded NAFTA Agreement\n\nand emphasized that there were some positives which could accrue from it.\n It was pointed out that Mexico had become a more important trading\n\npartner and Jamaican business interests should now turn their attention to\n\nexploiting the opportunities on the Mexican market.\n To further this objective, a decision was taken to open a Mexican\n\ninterest section in the JAMPRO Library at 35 Trafalgar Road, to facilitate\n\nthe dissemination of information on the opportunities for trade and joint\n\nventures which exist in Mexico. \n\n \n " An information network is vital to any expansion of trade or\n\nbusiness links.\n We need information on shipping, channels of distribution, prices,\n\netc.\n All this will be provided in the Mexican section of JAMPRO\'s Library,\n\nwhich will start early next month,"  Ambassador King announced,\n\nMexico will do the same through its counterpart to JAMPRO. \n\n  Mexico is now the second largest trading partner with the United\n\nStates, after Canada. \n says the\n\nJAMPRO Vice President.\n He said much more could be done by Jamaican business to expand trade\n\nwith Mexico, citing the fact that while Mexico exported about US$94 million\n\nworth of products ( mainly oil) to Jamaica, our exports to Mexico were just\n\nabout US$500,000.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  JAMAICA faces a huge expansion of tourist accommodation that will\n\nadd a further 3,000 rooms. \n\n  There is now a list of at least 10 hotels or condo projects and\n\nthis does not include planned additions to existing properties of elusive\n\ndreams like the Rollins Rosehall project. \n\n  The list includes the high-profile Butch Stewart Beaches project,\n\nthe low-profile Couples Negril and Couples MoBay, the controversial\n\nMelhado-Cameron development in Negril and the Round Hill Hyatt project. \n\n  Round Hill Hyatt: Informed

{'text': 'The Industrial Disputes Tribunal ( IDT), in a majority award, has\n\nordered the re- instatement of a former stacker at the Jamaica Flour Mills,\n\nwhose dismissal based on medical reports sparked a strike in March. \n\n  The employee, Mark Poole, was fired on February 29, on the grounds\n\nthat he was unable to carry out his job due to medical reason.\n\n\n  His dismissal sparked a strike which lasted over a week, as the\n\nworkers refused to abide by an order from the IDT to resume work after\n\nefforts at the Ministry of Labour failed to resolve the issue. \n\n  The company said that he had carried out his duties satisfactorily\n\nuntil May, 1991, when they received a medical report from Dr. Errol Campbell,\n\nindicating that he had a back problem and recommending that he be assigned\n\nwork which did not involve  " the lifting of too much weight."\n\n \n\n  The company said that no alternative job could be found which\n\nwould involve lighter duties. \n\n  The company contended that: Poole\'s own medical reports clearly\n\nestablished that he was unfit for the job; they did not and still do not have\n\nany position for which he is qualified, providing lighter work; and, the\n\ntermination of his service was in keeping with his own doctor\'s medical\n\nreports. \n\n  The NWU, which represented Poole, said that the company had\n\ncomplied with the doctor\'s request by shifting him from stacker to general\n\nworker, which involved much less lifting.\n Poole continued physiotherapy treatment until a doctor\'s certificate\n\nwas issued on November 15, 1991, indicating that the aches had disappeared.\n After the doctor\'s report, the company asked that he resigned or be\n\nfired. \n\n  The union said it disagreed with the company\'s decision on the\n\ngrounds that Poole had recovered sufficiently and the duties of the general\n\nworker had helped him in recovering. \n\n  They said that the company acted hastily in dismissing him and\n\nthat he should be reinstated, without infringement to his status as an\n\nemployee of the company. \n\n  The Tribunal awarded that Poole be reinstated with full wages as\n\nfrom March 1, 1992.\n\n\nrepresentative, Irvin Jones, supported the award, but \n\nrepresentative, Chester Burgess, did not. \n\n  The JFM was represented by Robert Baugh, attorney-at-law, and the\n\nunion by Vincent Morrison, deputy island supervisor.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  Canadian journalist, Mr. Oakland Ross, will be the next speaker\n\nat Speakers Gallery - a monthly lecture series sponsored by the Bustamante\n\nInstitute of Public & International Affairs, a non-governmental organization.\n\n\n\n  For a decade, from 1980 until 1990, Mr. Ross was a foreign\n\ncorrespondent for Canada\'s leading newspaper, the Toronto Globe and Mail.\n\n\n\n  From Latin America and the Caribbean, he has reported on\n\npolitical turmoil in Jamaica and Haiti, communist rule in Cuba, civil war in\n\nEl Salvador, guerrilla campaigns in Nicaragua, anti-government protests in\n\nChile, and the day-to-day lives of ordinary people - from northern Mexico to\n\nsouthern Argentina. \n\n  In Africa, he has covered wars and strife in Mozambique, Angola,\n\nEthiopia, the Sudan, and South Africa, and has travelled the length and\n\nbreadth of the continent, writing about subject as diverse as wine-making\n\nmonks in Tanzania, sacred crocodiles in the Ivory Coast, and mountain\n\nherd-boys in Lesotho. \n\n  Winner of three national newspaper award citations in Canada and\n\nrecipient of a special award from the Inter-America Press Association, Mr.\n\nRoss has appeared frequently on television and radio in Canada to comment\n\nabout life and events in Africa and Latin America. \n\n  Mr. Ross will be Guest Speaker at the Speakers Gallery today at\n\nthe PCJ Auditorium at 5:30 p.m.\n He will recount many of his stories and share some of the impressions\n\nhe has gathered during almost ten years of living in, and writing about, two\n\nof the world\'s most troubled but also fascinating regions.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  GLEN Andrade, Q.C., Director of Public Prosecutions, has warned\n\nthat wherever it is clearly established by evidence that any foreign\n\nnationals attempt to kidnap or violate the laws of this country, they will be\n\ndealt with accordingly like any other citizen of the land. \n\n  He issued the warning in response to recent reports about foreign\n\nagents coming here to kidnap persons and take them abroad. \n\n  , Mr. Andrade said\n\nthe fact is that there has been one such case in recent times where a person\n\nwho is a United States citizen and  may be\n\ndescribed as a bondsman, attempted to take a Guyanese national back to the\n\nUSA.\n He said the attempt was thwarted largely through the assistance of\n\nthe US Embassy. \n\n \n " It must be noted that this man was not and should not be regarded\n\nas an official of the US Government and that seems to be the basic\n\nmisconception that the public has with regard to that incident.\n This man did not represent the US Government, he could have come from\n\nany other country,"  Mr. Andrade said. \n\n  He said the USA recognizes the Extradition Treaty between the USA\n\nand Jamaica and it was honoured strictly to the letter.\n He said US nationals were extradited and sometimes deported at the\n\ndiscretion of the Minister and Jamaicans who committed serious crimes in the\n\nUSA and fled the country were returned or extradited to the USA pursuant to a\n\nrequest and the provisions of the treaty and the Extradition Act being\n\nsatisfied.\n Likewise, he said Jamaicans and foreigners who had committed crimes\n\nin Jamaica and fled to the USA were returned pursuant to our request for\n\nextradition. \n\n \n\n  It should be clearly understood, he said, that in all this the\n\ntwo countries co-operate within    the   framework\n\nof the Act and the Treaty to the extent that the Office of the DPP represents\n\nthe US government when applications for extraditions were made and likewise\n\nwhen the Jamaican Government made an application for extradition, the US\n\nJustice Department, represented the Jamaican Government. \n\n \n " Where it is clearly established by evidence that any foreign\n\nnationals attempt to kidnap or violate the laws of this country, they will be\n\ndealt with accordingly like any other citizen of the land.\n I see nothing up to now which would cause me to entertain any doubt\n\nas to the sovereignty of this country being eroded or interfered with by any\n\nforeign government,"  Mr. Andrade said. \n\n  Drug Enforcement agents, he said, did not operate in this country\n\nautonomously.\n He said they worked in co-operation with the local police in the\n\nfight against drug trafficking and it was to the mutual benefit of both\n\ncountries that it should be so. \n " If Jamaica should get on top of this scourge of drug, we cannot do\n\nit alone. We must have the co-operation of the international community."\n\n\n He said when a US Drug Enforcement Agency agent was operating in\n\ncollaboration with our local security forces that was an instance of    co-operation   that was expected between both\n\ncountries, he added.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  THE sale of the assets and liabilities of Bank of Credit and\n\nCommerce International ( Overseas) ( BCCI) Jamaican branch to Workers Bank\n\nhas been confirmed.\n\n\n  carried a CANA report saying\n\nWorkers Savings and Loan Bank may have won the bid for the BCCI branch which\n\nhad been put into liquidation following the collapse of its parent company a\n\nyear ago. \n\n  Liquidator William Thwaites would neither confirm nor deny the\n\n   agreement   but said something was in the\n\noffing. \n\n  Yesterday the parties signed the agreement in New Kingston, after\n\nwhich Mr. Thwaites issued a press release. \n\n  As part of the sale, Workers will take over the deposit\n\nobligations of BCCI and substantially all of BCCI\'s loan portfolio. \n\n  -\n\n closed New Kingston office of BCCI. \n " The agreement will have to be considered and approved by a meeting\n\nof creditors of BCCI, and by the Supreme Court.\n After these approvals are obtained, the transfer will be completed\n\nand deposits in BCCI, frozen since July of last year, will be transferred to\n\nWorkers,"  Mr. Thwaites said. \n\n  He paid special tribute to the Committee of Inspection, appointed\n\nby the creditors and comprised of Herbert Aris, A. Mansingh, Sylvester\n\nMorrison, Rupert Straw and Beverley Williamson.\n He added that he had received particular support and cooperation from\n\nthe Bank of Jamaica. \n\n \n " This sale is the result of a careful process of identifying and\n\noffering a portfolio of the bank\'s asset and liabilities for sale to local\n\ncommercial banks.\n The offer received by Workers was the most attractive, and represents\n\nthe best way of freeing up  money as soon as possible.\n I am advised by my attorneys, Myer Fletcher & Gordon, that the\n\ntransaction will still have to be considered by the depositors and by the\n\ncourt, but I am hopeful that once that is done, depositors can regain access\n\nto their money."  \n\n \n\n  Referring to the agreement, Chairman of Workers, Delroy Lindsay,\n\nsaid  " We at Workers are pleased to be a part of this transaction.\n We will welcome these depositors as new customers, and look forward\n\nto extending our usual good customer service to them."  \n\n  At the time of the shut-down of its Cayman Islands-based parent\n\ncompany on the orders of regulators in Britain and Luxembourg, the Jamaican\n\nbranch of BCCI had assets of just over J$300 million.\n It held deposits of J$175 million and its assets exceeded liabilities\n\nby approximately J$30 million. \n\n  The acquisition of BCCI by Workers is the latest dramatic move by\n\nthat company after only two years when Workers itself was on the verge of\n\ncollapse.\n At that time it was controlled by mass-based institutions and passive\n\nshareholding by Government.\n The Workers was losing money heavily and had a negative net worth\n\nuntil it was acquired by Mr. Lindsay\'s Corporate Group. \n\n  An injection of\n\n$45 million and strong corporate management has turned the bank around and\n\nfrom a loss of J$39 million in 1990, last year it recorded a profit of\n\n$8,1 million with assets of approximately\n\n$1,6 billion.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ncocaine was seized at Lime Cay, off Port Royal, Tuesday night by the\n\nNarcotics Police.\n They were acting on a tip from the United States Drug Enforcement\n\nAdministration office here. \n\n  The drug is worth US$13.570 million approximately J$305.325\n\nmillion. \n\n  It was the largest amount of cocaine seized here by the police\n\nsince 1986 when they found 1,207 lb. of the drug in St. Elizabeth. Det. Shead\n\nof the Police Narcotics Division, credited Tuesday\'s find, which brings the\n\ntotal amount of cocaine seized here so far this year to 1,420 lb., to the\n\nalertness and co-operation of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration office\n\nhere. \n\n  Around 5 p.m., the local DEA office passed on a tip from its\n\noffice in Colombia that a boat from that country in the northwest of South\n\nAmerica was on its way to Port Royal with cocaine. \n\n \n\n  The information was that the cocaine was to be off-loaded,\n\ntransferred to another boat and then taken to the United States.\n Acting quickly, the Narcotics Police got the use of a pleasure craft\n\nand in a bid to spot the cocaine boat from Colombia, went on surveillance of\n\nthe cays off Port Royal. \n\n  During the three-hour operation which lasted from 6 p.m. to 9\n\np.m., the police boarded and searched several pleasure boats, including some\n\ntransporting tourists and Jamaicans to Morgan\'s Harbour or Port Royal from\n\nLime Cay where they had gone to picnic, party, swim or just to have fun on\n\nthe beach.\n\n\n  But the Narcotics Police were convinced of the accuracy of the\n\ninformation from the DEA and they decided to go ashore on Lime Cay and search\n\nfor the cocaine.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '6d60ec5e-445e-418a-826f-6d9f4d6ce1e0', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.456713+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9819345474243164, 'non_english_score': 0.018065452575683594}
{'text': 'A STEPPED up drive against crime, especially in Kingston, is being\n\nlaunched in the wake of the upsurge of criminal violence in the city, which\n\nreached a new height of horror with the slaying of four persons on Thursday\n\nmorning. \n\n  checks and\n\nraids are among a number of measures being undertaken by the security forces\n\nto combat criminal activity plaguing the Corporate Area especially. \n\n  Decision on the new drive was taken at a meeting between Minister\n\nof National Security and Justice K. D. Knight, representatives of the\n\nsecurity forces and some Corporate Area Members of Parliament and Councillors\n\nrepresenting both major political parties. \n\n  The meeting, held Thursday, was called following the murder of\n\nfour people that morning in Arnett Gardens, a criminally-volatile community\n\nin South St. Andrew ( not South West St. Andrew as was mentioned in\n\nyesterday\'s lead story). \n\n  One man has been detained in connection with the murders and up to\n\nyesterday he was still being interrogated.\n Police said they were making steady progress in the investigation.\n\n\n\n  A release from the Ministry said other measures to be undertaken\n\nby the security forces include an increase in foot and vehicular patrols,\n\nsurveillance activities on land and sea, improvements in the witness\n\nprotection programme, and strengthening of intelligence gathering\n\ncapabilities, including qualitative and  <-> quantative</-\n\n>quantitative changes in the area of agents. \n\n \n\n  Representatives of both political parties reaffirmed their\n\nsupport of the security forces in fighting crime and urged the public to join\n\nin giving their support to the law enforcement officers. \n\n  The meeting also supported Mr. Knight\'s decision to reorganise\n\nthe National Advisory Committee on Crime as soon as the term of office of the\n\ncurrent membership expires, and its report is submitted.\n\n\n  Participants at the meeting also agreed that measures approved by\n\nthe Inner-city Task Force should be speedily implemented.\n They extended condolence and sympathy to families and individuals\n\nsaddened by criminal acts. \n\n  Among those present at the meeting were: Member of Parliament for\n\nEast Kingston and Port Royal, Marjorie Taylor, in whose constituency a\n\ncurrent gang warfare area, Franklin Town, is located; Member of Parliament\n\nfor South St. Andrew, Bobby Jones, sections of whose constituency have seen\n\nseveral murders and other heinous crimes this year, and in whose constituency\n\nthe four people were murdered on Thursday; Member of Parliament for Central\n\nKingston, Ralph Brown; Opposition Spokesman on National Security, Neville\n\nLewis; St. Andrew Eastern Member of Parliament, Edmund Bartlett; and\n\nCouncillor for the Tivoli Gardens Division, Desmond McKenzie.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  FOR the first time in Jamaica, a commercial bank has entered into\n\na joint venture agreement with an off  -  shore information processing\n\ncompany to provide a new skill to be transferred to many Jamaicans. \n\n  Through Computer Services and Programming Limited-CSP, Mutual\n\nSecurity Bank has joined forces with National Transcription\n\nTechnologies-United States, to establish a medical transcription service\n\nbureau that will provide services initially for NTT\'s North American clients.\n\n\n\n  The company will be known as NTT ( Jamaica) Limited, and it will\n\noperate out of the Free Zone at Fiscal Services, 234B Old Hope Road.\n The Jamaica dollar equivalent of US\n\n$1.5 million will be invested by Mutual Security Bank over a two year period\n\nwhile NTT ( US) has invested US$4 million. \n\n  The announcement was made by Douglas Folkes, Managing Director of\n\nMutual Security Bank Limited and Chairman of Computer Service and Programming\n\nat a press conference to announce the joint venture agreement between\n\nComputer Service and Programming and National Transcription Technologies at\n\nMutual Security Bank\'s Board Room yesterday. \n\n  He said the entity in the first three years would be owned\n\nequally by Mutual Security and NTT-US on the assumption that NTT performed\n\nthe services as expected but during the fourth to fifth year NTT\'s ownership\n\nwould be increased and by year five, Mutual Security Bank will own 28 per\n\ncent of the business. \n\n  Mr. Folkes explained that Mutual Security Bank has a financial\n\ntarget and on the basis that healthy profits will be generated from the\n\nventure, the bank was willing to settle for 28 per cent of the entity. \n\n  NTT-Jamaica is expected to generate a conservative revenue during\n\nthe first three years but in the fifth year and onwards a net inflow of US$10\n\nmillion is expected. \n\n \n\n  Mr. Folkes said there was a severe shortage of medical\n\ntranscription technicians in the USA whose work involved transcribing   records for medical practitioners.\n The US market for medical transcription, he said, was estimated to be\n\nbetween US$600 million and US$1 billion annually. \n\n  NTT has largely concentrated its efforts in the Florida area,\n\nwhere there are about 220 hospitals and with this client base Mutual Security\n\nwas confident that in allying its computer service subsidiary with NTT it had\n\nmade a wise decision, he said. \n\n  Mr. Folkes said in addition to the direct returns from the\n\ninvestment, CSP will be able to earn income from offsite data storage.\n This will be possible because of the level of compatibility of the\n\ntransmission lines and computer equipment in Jamaica with those in the United\n\nStates. \n\n \n " Another important benefit is training for Jamaicans in medical\n\ninformation technology.\n At present, the profession of medical information technician does not\n\nexist in Jamaica.\n he\n\nsaid. \n\n  Mr. Folkes said the aim was to establish the necessary knowledge\n\nbase to support an industry which gave indications of growth and so a\n\nprogramme has been set up in collaboration with EXED Community College to\n\nprovide the required training, with NTT acting as a developmental and\n\nmonitoring consultant. \n\n  Already the first batch of students has graduated from the\n\n6-month training programme and was undergoing hands on training.\n The company NTT ( Jamaica) expects to employ 20 entry level\n\ntechnicians after this first pilot training project but the number is    expected   to exceed 350 in the fifth year of the\n\nproject. \n\n  He said NTT ( Jamaica) will not only contribute significantly to\n\nJamaica\'s balance of trade over time but it will also provide lucrative\n\nemployment opportunities, and establish an educational base for a new\n\nprofession by providing a licensing programme. \n\n  This will, hopefully, pave the way for other medical services\n\nwhich are seeking cost effective labour solutions.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  AN interim agreement to officially hand over operations of the\n\nformer Government Printing Office ( GPO) to Jamaica Printing Services ( 1992)\n\nLimited ( JPS), the new company established by the former GPO workers, was\n\nsigned on Thursday by Minister of the Public Service, Dr. Paul Robertson, and\n\nthe Hon. Williams Isaacs, who is chairman of the new company. \n\n  At the signing, which took place at the Oceana Hotel, Dr.\n\nRobertson said that  " under the agreement the former GPO premises\n\nwill be leased to the Jamaica Printing Services Limited for an initial period\n\nof one year.\n And the company has agreed to relocate its operations during this\n\ncontract period."  \n\n  All equipment, furniture, fixtures and motor vehicles used in the\n\noperations of the former GPO will also be leased to the new company.\n The JPS will continue negotiations with the Government and the\n\nNational Investment Bank of Jamaica for a long-term agreement. \n\n  Having identified the capacity of the new company to handle the\n\nprinting needs of the Government, Dr. Robertson announced that the Jamaica\n\nPrinting Services Limited has been appointed as the Government Printer\n\ncommencing on August 15. \n\n \n " As Government Printer, the JPS will be authorized to print, publish\n\nand distribute the Jamaica Gazette, Gazette Supplements and Gazettes\n\nExtraordinary, according to the Jamaica Gazette Act.\n The company will also provide printing services to Parliament,\n\nincluding the printing of Hansard, the Laws of Jamaica, all subsidiary\n\nlegislation, as well as other services,"  the Minister said. \n\n  He congratulated the former GPO workers, who have committed\n\napproximately\n\n$700,000 of their funds to capitalize the JPS, under the auspices of the\n\nEmployee Share Ownership Plan ( ESOP).\n This move, he noted, was a positive one, which he hoped will receive\n\nthe full support of all other clients of the GPO. \n\n  Speaking on the behalf of former GPO workers, Mr. Desmond Tucker,\n\na board member of Jamaica Printing Services Limited, said  " the\n\nemployee owners of the company are committed to making the venture a\n\nsuccess."  \n\n  The former GPO production supervisor said that when the\n\nGovernment Printing Office was closed in June,  " we saw the scope for\n\noperating the entity as a private employee  -  owned venture, and had\n\ndiscussions with our unions with the aim of making worker ownership of the\n\nGPO a reality."  \n\n  The Government Printing Office was closed on June 8 of this year\n\nas part of the Government\'s move to rationalize the Public Service and\n\ntransfer certain public entities to private sector ownership.\n At the time of the closure, employees of the GPO were given first\n\noption to purchase the operations under ESOP. \n\n  Through consultations with the National Investment Bank of\n\nJamaica, the workers indicated their acceptance of the offer and put in place\n\na team of employee representatives, lawyers, accountants and management\n\nconsultants to develop a business plan, and to conduct negotiations for the\n\nacquisition of the GPO operations.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ninvestigations into the identity of the driver of the boat which killed\n\n44-year-old Italian tourist, Stefano Pietrogrande, while he was swimming\n\nclose to shore at UDC\'s condominium hotel The Point in Negril. \n\n  Negril\'s Police Superintendant Scarlett declined to release the\n\neye  -  witness description of the boat in case this hampers\n\ninvestigations.\n Local opinion is that the boat which was equipped with an outboard\n\nengine may have been one of the numerous \'hustler boats\' that plague the\n\narea. \n\n  Pietrogrande was with a group of about 27 persons whose travel\n\nagent was La Giamiaca in Italy. \n\n  has ascertained that The Point, which had\n\na \'soft opening\' on July 1 has not yet applied for a licence from the Jamaica\n\nTourist Board and was therefore operating in breach of the Tourist Board Act.\n\n\n\n  Deputy tourism director Harry Knowles said that the Board had not\n\nbeen informed of the opening. \n\n  Resident manager Norma Lee Haye confirmed that the group of\n\nItalians was booked through the Government-owned National Hotels and\n\nProperties Ltd. which is the management company operating the hotel\'s pool\n\nUDC and individually-owned apartments. \n\n  to NHP\'s managing director,\n\nHugh Dyke, whose phone rang without answer. \n\n  Meanwhile, the Negril Chamber of Commerce has issued a statement\n\nwhich said: \n " Unfortunately, the Negril Chamber of Commerce is not really\n\nsurprised at the fatal accident that occurred on Thursday, August 20, 1992\n\noff The Point, Negril, in which a tourist was killed by a motor boat. \n\n  " For many years, the Negril Chamber of Commerce has pleaded with\n\nthe relevant authorities to really regulate motorized watersports in our\n\narea&dotted-line; but year by year the threats and dangers to the swimmers\n\nare on the increase. \n\n  " NCC has over the years recommended that jet skis/wave runners\n\nbe banned as five different attempts at controlling them have dismally\n\nfailed.\n NCC has urged that a proper water police patrol be made available in\n\nNegril so as to enforce the existing laws and update the fines for violation,\n\nand/or seizing of offending boats. \n\n  " Today, the waters are a free-for-all.\n Too few seem to follow the rules, whilst so many boats have become an\n\nintegral part of \'beach hustling\'&dotted-line;

that produced by electro-deposition is called electrolytic\n\ntinplate. \n\n \n\n \n\n  The methods of manufacture of tinplate and\n\nblackplate are the province of the producer. \n\n  The methods of using tinplate and blackplate\n\nare the province of the user. \n\n  The tin used for the coating of tinplate shall\n\nhave a purity of not less than 99.75% \n\n  The chemical composition of the steel shall be\n\nagreed upon between the producer and the purchaser provided that it is\n\nconsistent with the requirements of this standard ( see clause  14\n\n ) . \n\n  At the time they are made available by the\n\nproducer and under normal conditions of transport and storage, tinplate and\n\nblackplate are suitable for surface treatments such as established lacquering\n\nand printing operations.\n Appropriate grades and tempers are also suitable for shaping\n\noperations such as stamping, drawing, folding and bending, and assembly work\n\nsuch as joint forming, soldering ( tinplate only) and welding.\n The purchaser\'s order requirements shall be consistent with the end\n\nuse of the product. \n\n \n\n  There are four recognized commercial\n\nfinishes for electrolytic tinplate namely, bright, stone, matt and silver (\n\nsee  2.4  ) .\n\n\n  ( a) the surface characteristics of the steel base which\n\nprincipally result from controlled preparation of the work rolls used\n\nduring the final stages of temper rolling; \n\n \n\n \n\n  Blackplate shall be available in the same\n\nsteel base surface finishes. \n\n  3.7 Surface treatments ( electrolytic tinplate only)\n\n  \n\n \n A chemical or electrochemical treatment applied to the surface of\n\nelectrolytic tinplate to produce a surface of improved resistance to\n\ndiscolouration and superior lacquering and printing quality.\n The usual procedure is cathodic treatment in a solution of sodium\n\ndichromate ( see  14.2.4  ) . \n\n \n Normally the surface of electrolytic tinplate has applied to it a\n\nvery thin coating of an oil which is suitable for food packaging ( see \n\n14.2.1  ) . \n\n \n When ordering tinplate and blackplate it is recommended that the\n\npurpose of manufacture for which the tinplate or blackplate is intended\n\nshould be stated.\n The purchaser should indicate to the producer the direction of\n\nrolling required. \n\n \n It is recommended that, if required, the producer supplies to the\n\npurchaser such details of the steelmaking process as may assist the\n\npurchaser in his efficient use of the material.\n It is further recommended that the purchaser be informed of any\n\nalterations in the method of manufacture which will significantly affect the\n\nproperties of the purchased product.\n Similarly, it is recommended that the purchaser informs the producer\n\nof modifications in the fabrication methods which will significantly affect\n\nthe way in which the purchased product is used. \n\n \n\n \n Standard grade electrolytic tinplate represents the normal production\n\nof lines employing the usual inspection and classification procedures.\n In normal conditions of storage and use, standard grade electrolytic\n\ntinplate permits lacquering and printing over the entire surface. \n\n  Electrolytic tinplate, second grade, is\n\navailable in certain countries.\n It represents the best sheets rejected from the standard grade\n\nbut may contain sheets exhibiting surface imperfections, tinning, shape and\n\nother defects to a minor extent ( but not pinholes or off-gauge material).\n Suitability for lacquering and printing over the entire surface is\n\nnot guaranteed. \n\n \n After coating, hot-dipped tinplate is inspected and graded as\n\nfollows: \n\n  Tinplate which at the\n\ntime of despatch is free from defects readily visible to the unaided eye.\n In normal conditions of storage and use it is suitable for lacquering\n\nor printing over the entire surface of the sheet. \n\n \n Tinplate which at the time of dispatch has visible imperfections\n\nof moderate magnitude or frequency.\n Lacquering or printing over the entire surface of the sheet is not\n\nguaranteed. \n\n  NOTE. The term " \'standard grade\' " is applied\n\nto hot-dipped tinplate which is inspected during processing and from which\n\nmaterial not of first or second grade is rejected.\n The accepted material however, is not segregated into first and\n\nsecond grades. \n\n \n Blackplate is line inspected during processing.\n\n\nfections of only moderate magnitude or frequency is included.\n Blackplate is liable to rust, but at the time it is made available by\n\nthe producer the material is suitable for normal lacquering and printing\n\nover the entire surface. \n\n \n\n\n  because   of surface imperfections or shape\n\ndefects of limited extent is available as second grade.\n Suitability for lacquering or printing over the entire surface of the\n\nsheet is not guaranteed. \n\n \n\n \n Tin coating masses shall be expressed in grams per square metre ( g/m\n\n 2  ) . \n\n \n caption\n\n \n\n \n caption\n\n \n\n \n caption\n\n \n\n \n The average value of the coating masses of the sample selected to\n\nrepresent a consignment in accordance with clause  8  and tested\n\nin accordance with clause  9  shall not be lower than the\n\nappropriate minimum average coating mass as specified in tables 1, 2 and 3.\n\n\n\n \n The individual specimens of the sample may show tin coating as low\n\nas, 80% of the minimum average coating mass for equally coated or\n\ndifferentially coated electrolytic tinplate, and 60% of the minimum average\n\ncoating mass for hot-dipped tinplate.\n It is emphasized that isolated specimens have no representative value\n\nin relation to the consignment under consideration. \n\n \n In practice the producer aims to apply the nominal coating mass, the\n\nminimum average coating mass values only occasionally being encountered. \n\n \n In order to distinguish material having differential coatings,\n\nthe sheet shall be marked on one surface which, by agreement, can be either\n\nthe lightly or the heavily coated surface.\n In all cases, both the surface to be marked and the surface which is\n\nto be piled uppermost shall be clearly designated on the contract by the\n\npurchaser.\n Generally the marking shall be made on the heavily coated surface in\n\nthe form of dull straight continuous parallel lines about 1.0 mm wide ( see\n\nappendix A).\n If the marking is on the lightly coated surface then at least\n\nalternate lines should be interrupted, or geometrical patterns may be used.\n\n\n\n \n\n  The term " \'temper\' " , when\n\napplied to tinplate and blackplate, summarizes a combination of interrelated\n\nmechanical properties and no single mechanical test can measure all the\n\nvarious factors which contribute to the fabrication characteristics of the\n\nmaterial.\n However, the Rockwell 30T hardness test ( HR 30T) is the best single\n\ntest available and serves as a guide to the properties of the material.\n This test forms the basis for a system of temper classification.\n Hardness values at which the producer shall aim are specified in\n\ntable 4. \n\n  The purchaser shall specify the temper\n\nrequired by reference to the appropriate temper classification as given in\n\ntable 4.   \n\n  The hardness of tinplate and blackplate shall\n\nbe determined on samples selected in accordance with the requirements of\n\nclause  8  and tested in accordance with requirements of clause\n\n 10  .\n When evaluating the hardness of tinplate and blackplate, average\n\nvalues and not individual values shall be considered.\n The Rockwell hardness values given in table 4 are for tests\n\nperformed with a diamond anvil on tinplate after detinning. \n\n \n \'anvil\'\n\n effect and hence is affected by the thickness of the test specimen.\n The values given in table 4 are typical for nominal thicknesses in\n\nthe range of 0.25 mm to 0.30 mm.\n Material of the same metallurgical quality in 0.22 mm thickness, for\n\ninstance, would be one HR 30T unit higher and material of 0.43 mm thickness\n\none unit lower.\n Thinner material, for example 0.17 mm, may be 2 units higher.\n For a given temper classification, the corresponding HR 30T values\n\nfor blackplate may be as much as 4 units lower, depending on the age of the\n\nmaterial and the conditions of storage. \n\n \n On relatively thin material the HR 15T test may be employed and the\n\nvalues converted to HR 30T ( see appendix B). \n\n  The mechanical properties of continuously\n\nannealed tinplate and blackplate and batch annealed material of the same HR\n\n30T hardness are not identical.\n By agreement, the type of annealing, [ batch ( BA), or continuous (\n\nCA)] may be specified when ordering for example, T 61 ( BA) or T 61 ( CA).\n\n\n\n \n HR 30T test values may be affected by the surface roughness of the\n\nsteel base obtained by the use of shot blast rolls in the final pass of\n\ntemper rolling. \n\n \n\n \n Tinplate and blackplate are normally available in any nominal\n\nthickness which is a multiple of 0.01 mm from 0.15 mm up to and including\n\n0.49 mm.\n\n\n \n The average thickness of the consignment shall be determined by\n\nweighing whole sheets, or by direct measurement using a micrometer. \n\n  When the weighing technique is used, the mass of each whole\n\nsheet is determined, its area is measured, and the thickness determined by\n\napplying the formula as given in  7.1.1.1.  \n\n  The mass of the sheet shall be determined to a precision of 2 g\n\nand the dimensions of the sheet shall be measured to a precision of 0.5 mm.\n\n\n  If the average thickness of a consignment is to be determined by\n\ndirect measurement, a hand-operated micrometer shall be used.\n It shall be accurate to 0.001 mm.\n The measurement of thickness shall be carried out at least 10 mm\n\nfrom the trimmed edge.\n In any case of dispute, retesting of thickness by the weighing\n\nmethod only shall be employed. \n\n  NOTE.\n It is recommended that when a micrometer is used it should have a\n\nball ended shank anvil of approximately 3 mm diameter, a curved surface\n\nanvil of approximately 25 mm radius and a face diameter of approximately\n\n13 mm. \n\n  Thickness shall be calculated by applying\n\nthe following formula:  \n\n  For determining the variation of\n\nthickness within a sheet, using the specimens Y ( see figure 3) either the\n\nweighing or the direct measurement technique shall be employed.\n If using the former, the thickness of each of the specimens Y shall\n\nbe determined by weighing the specimen, measuring the area and applying the\n\nformula given in  7.1.1.1.', 'subdomain':

Chancellor or Principal, through the Head of\n\nDepartment or Dean as appropriate.\n The University will be obliged to purchase such excess leave within a\n\nreasonable time, which must not exceed four months from the date of the\n\nrequest. \n\n  The University may, in writing, offer to purchase such excess\n\nleave for an immediate cash equivalent. \n\n  A Staff member who is proceeding on local leave for a period of\n\nfifteen ( 15) working days or longer may at that time exercise the option to\n\nsell the remaining local leave less twenty-one ( 21) working days which must\n\nbe held to satisfy any emergency that may arise from time to time. \n\n  Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays shall not be counted in\n\nlocal leave. \n\n \n\n  The normal work week for non-teaching/non-research staff\n\nshall be forty hours consisting of eight hours per day ( inclusive of one\n\nhour meal break) Monday to Friday. \n\n \n\n  Effective February 1, 1997, where the workload in a\n\ndepartment/section necessitates non-teaching/non-research staff working on\n\nSaturdays, prior permission must be obtained from the Head of Department or\n\nnominee.\n In such cases work in excess of three hours will be paid at the rate\n\nof \n\n$3,500  per day.\n However if the staff member reports for duty and works up to three\n\nhours, he/she will be entitled to payment of one-half the daily rate or\n\n\n\n$1,750  .\n\n\n$5,200  for work in excess of three hours or \n\n$2,600  for three hours or less. \n\n  In the case of the library, in order to meet operational\n\nrequirements, some staff members may be required to work on Saturdays from\n\n8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. in which case they shall be entitled to a compensatory\n\nday off at a mutually convenient time.\n\n\n  If the staff member applies for the compensatory day off and\n\nthis cannot be granted within the 60 days he/she shall receive payment in\n\nlieu. \n\n \n\n  The Grievance procedure shall be amended by adding the following\n\nsection: \n\n  ( v) If the parties fail to mutually agree upon the selection of\n\nan arbitrator after ten ( 10) days of a request by either party for arbi <l>\n\ntration, either party shall immediately request the services of the Ministry\n\nof Labour to provide a list of five ( 5) arbitrators.\n The parties shall have seven ( 7) days following receipt of the list,\n\nto select an arbitrator in the following manner.\n The Union shall have the right to strike one name from the list, the\n\nUniversity shall then strike one name, and the process will be repeated and\n\nthe remaining person shall be the arbitrator.\n However, if after seven days one of the parties fails to adhere to\n\nthe preceding arrangement the other party will request the Ministry of Labour\n\nto act on behalf of the delinquent party in order to complete the proc <l>\n\ness.\n The decision of the arbitrator shall be binding upon the parties.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Members of the Union shall have access to their official personal\n\nfiles maintained by the University.\n All official personal files shall be made available for examination\n\non location in the presence of the relevant University officer or Nominee.\n\n\n\n  No materials relating to the staff member's\n\nacademic/professional performance and conduct shall be placed in the member's\n\nfile without the member being given the opportunity to read the document\n\nand attach any comments he or she may so desire.\n Each such document shall be initialled by the member and returned to\n\nthe relevant University Officer as evidence of having read the document. \n\n  The initialling shall not be deemed to constitute approval by the\n\nmember of the contents of such document.\n If the member refuses to initial such document after having been\n\ngiven the opportunity to read the same, a statement to that effect shall be\n\naffixed to the document by the relevant University Officer or Nominee and\n\nwitnessed by another member of the Bargaining Unit. \n\n  In the event that personal files are kept by Deans, Heads of\n\nDepartment/Section/Unit, all such files shall be made accessible on location\n\nto the respective members of staff at their request, in the presence of the\n\nrelevant Dean, Head of Department/Section/Unit or nominee. \n\n  The foregoing is in addition to the existing agreement that\n\nall members of staff shall be sent copies of any letters, reports or memo <l>\n\nranda referring to them written by their Head of Department, Head of Section\n\nor equivalent responsible officer. \n\n \n\n  Whenever redundancies are being considered, wherever\n\npractical an opportunity will be given for staff in posts to be made\n\nredundant to be reassigned ( with re- tooling as necessary) elsewhere in the\n\ninstitution. \n\n  Persons who have retired but continue to be employed will be the\n\nfirst to be terminated.\n An advisory committee comprising four ( 4) representatives from the\n\nUniversity and two ( 2) from the Union will be established to recommend\n\nto the relevant Finance & General Purposes Committee which additional persons\n\nshould be terminated as a result of positions being made redundant.\n The Committee's recommendations shall be based on an assessment\n\nof the persons concerned using the criteria for assessment and promotions set\n\nout in Ordinance 8.12 ( b). \n\n  Where it is not possible to make a clear distinction between\n\nstaff on the basis of the Ordinance 8.12 ( b) criteria, the following shall\n\napply: \n\n  ( a) Staff who are on shorter contracts shall go before those on\n\nlonger contracts. \n\n \n\n  ( c) Where members of staff cannot be distinguished based on\n\nthe above criteria the  'last-in-first-out'  principle shall\n\nbe used as a tie-breaker. \n\n  The provisions of the Employment ( Termination and\n\nRedundancy Payments) Act will form the basis of settlement, provided however\n\nthat the notice period in existing contracts of employment will, if more\n\nfavourable, apply. \n\n  Where termination benefits are to be paid, the determination of\n\nyears of service shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Employment\n\n( Termination & Redundancy Payments) Act.\n The calculation of termination benefits shall be based on the\n\nfollowing formula: \n\n  ( i) Staff members who have served one year or more but less than\n\nten ( 10) years shall receive 3 weeks pay for each year of service. \n\n  ( ii) Staff members who have served ten years or more but less\n\nthan twenty ( 20) years shall receive 4 weeks pay for each year of service.\n\n\n\n  ( iii) Staff members who are tenured or have served for 20 years\n\nor more shall receive 5 weeks pay for each year of service. \n\n \n\n  A reimbursable Technology/Instructional grant equivalent to\n\nUS$1,582.00 at time of signing will be made to members of the Bargaining Unit\n\nover the life of this agreement. \n\n  At the end of the third year of this Agreement the J$\n\nequivalent of this grant at the time of signing will be rolled into salary.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Deans shall receive annual allowances equivalent to 75% of the\n\nallowances paid to Pro-Vice Chancellors.\n\n\n  Entertainment\n\n$90,000 \n\n \n\n \n\n  Deputy, Vice, Associate or Assistant Deans and Heads of\n\nDepartment will receive 50% of the above-mentioned allowances applicable to\n\nDeans. \n\n \n\n  The salary scale of a Dean shall be the salary scale for\n\nProfessors. \n\n  In cases where the Dean is already in the Professor's salary\n\nscale, he/she shall continue to receive salary in that scale with scope for\n\nadjustment upon appointment to the post of Dean.\n\n\n  In cases where the Dean is not in the Professor's scale, he/she\n\nshall be paid a salary no less than the minimum point on the scale, with\n\nscope for adjustment commensurate with experience and academic status on\n\nappointment.\n\n\n  All salary increases referred to in the preceding\n\nparagraphs shall be treated as temporary and therefore payable only during\n\ntenure of the Deanship. \n\n \n\n  Deans will be considered staff on continuous service.\n On completion of tenure as Dean, the Dean shall be eligible for at\n\nleast one semester of Dean's Special Leave for each full term of

{'text': "Mention vegetables and most Jamaicans think of the vegetables they\n\ncook in their one pot soup.\n Ital ( no salt) foods which the Rastafarians cook \x13 also the\n\never-growing army of vegetarians are changing the green taste of Jamaica.\n Callaloo, which we use to make our pepperpot soup and team with\n\nseafood to make our Florentine dishes, flourishes everywhere.\n Barbers plant it between haircuts, some even switched and all they now\n\ncut is callaloo, or greens as they prefer to call it. \n\n  We are full of beans.\n The world may know it as kidney beans but we call it red peas;\n\nsusumber we rename gully beans and pigeon peas we call gungo peas.\n The fact is we use any lentil in combination with whatever is\n\navailable, but the trio of trotters, tripe and oxtail is definitely married\n\nto broad beans. \n\n  Although we do have unusual and interesting vegetables, we are\n\nstill in the process of learning to use them innovatively. \n\n \n\n  Rice and peas is usually rice and red kidney beans, Jamaica's\n\n 'Coat of Arms'  in cooking.\n ( Dried gungo peas, or green, when in season, are also used.)\n The proportions vary from household to household, but a 1/4 pt. of\n\ndried peas or a 1/2 pt. of freshly picked red peas or gungo to 1lb. rice is\n\nadequate.\n Dried peas are put on in cold water, green peas are put on in boiling\n\nwater. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  If dried peas are used, wash well before soaking\n\nand boil in the same water until cooked enough, but  not too much\n\n water should be used as coconut milk is also to be added.\n ( If dried peas are used soak for 2 hours, if peas are freshly picked\n\n( green) no soaking is necessary.). \n\n  When peas are nearly cooked, add rich milk from\n\nvery dry coconut ( p.148), bringing liquid to about twice or 2 1/2 times the\n\nquantity of rice to be used.\n\n\n  When peas are cooked, add seasoning.\n Wash rice and add to peas.\n When water boils again, reduce heat and cook on slow fire.\n Rice should be tender and all the liquid absorbed.\n ( Near the end of cooking time, if the grains are not quite cooked,\n\nand it is not advisable to add more water \x13 place a piece of Saran wrap\n\ninstead of foil on top of rice and cover.\n\n\n  When cooked, stir with a fork before serving.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  If preferred use margarine or butter and cow's milk, powdered\n\nskim milk or evaporated milk instead of coconut milk.\n If desired, fry a few strips of bacon, cut into small pieces and add.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n

Higglers spend their time between serving customers, shelling the\n\ngungo or pigeon peas, as they are called.\n Jamaicans on the whole, use much of them green, in soups, stews, with\n\nrice, and in rice and peas, so much so, that precious little survives to see\n\nthe sun and get dried.\n Lucille Jackman serves this dish with flair, from her adopted\n\nBarbados.\n Once I had some repairs done to my house and Mrs. Sylvia Hendricks\n\narranged a party, at which she cooked the Jamaican version of Doved peas.\n She mixed the cooked gungo peas with creole saltfish, topped by\n\ncrisp, fried corn pork and served with roasted, yellow heart breadfruit.\n Everyone was impressed with how delicious this simple mixture could\n\nbe. \n\n  It is difficult to state quantities because it is such a\n\nfavourite whenever cooked, but allow at least: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Boil 6 cups green gungo in enough water to\n\ncover. \n\n  Add 1 teaspoon salt ( if you have bacon cuttings\n\navailable and bits of ham, use some in the water boiling the peas.) \n\n  Put the remainder of the bacon and ham with some\n\nminced onion, and red and green pepper in a frying pan and fry in butter\n\nuntil cooked. \n\n  Add the cooked gungo and stir mixture in frying\n\npan until cooked. \n\n  Remove from heat and stir in a little butter.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  This recipe for croquettes with a real Jamaican twist, came from\n\nthe Scientific Research Council. \n\n  2 cups finely mashed, cooked breadfruit or cooked potato\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Saute mushrooms and

{'text': 'STUDENTS\'  WORKBOOKS IN HOME ECONOMICS?    \n\n  1. A very good foundation is key so we have to be sure that the\n\nvery basics are not being ignored or overlooked before more advanced\n\nmaterials are introduced.\n A child completing his/her first year of Food and Nutrition should,\n\nfor example be able to:- \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  iii. Differentiate between cookery tools and cookery equipment\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  - Cleaning, caring the refrigerator, cooker, blender, washing\n\nsoiled utensils; caring kitchen towels, using and cleaning the dust bin\n\nproperly, cleaning and caring cupboards \n\n  vi. Explain what are his/her teacher\'s expectations when a\n\npractical assignment is being completed \n\n \n\n \n\n  \'A Fine\n\nArt\'  and it is not cooking and consuming whatever we prepare rapidly\n\nbefore the next class! \n\n  2. The prepared questions should evoke within students, the urge\n\nto read ahead and try to complete more work on their own, whether a teacher\n\nis present or not.\n\n\n  3. The questions and general objectives will also act as a guide\n\nto teachers who are new to the profession enabling them to appreciate what\n\ndepth they need to pursue in some topics, especially with the younger\n\nstudents.\n Some topics need to be explored deeply, for example: Kitchen and\n\nPersonal Hygiene; Weighing and Measuring ingredients; Table Setting and\n\nEtiquette, Introducing Cookery Tools and Equipment used in the Laboratory,\n\nespecially those they will be utilising during their First Year;  BUT\n\n , there are other topics that it is just the very basics which are\n\nneeded at this stage.\n\n\n \n\nwithin the Department - Monthly tests and unit tests can be administered\n\nwithout researching questions.\n Also, we can be sure that the same teaching points and objectives are\n\npassed on to all the students.\n The section at the back of this booklet -\n\n NOTES  - is to enable each teacher to add his/her own questions and\n\nadditional activities.\n Also, before your students do the exercises on pages 36 and 37 of the\n\nFood and Nutrition Workbook, and page 29 of the Clothing and Textiles\n\nWorkbook, you may choose to number each item for ease of identification. \n\n  5. With the students using their workbooks along with their\n\nnotebooks, it is much easier for a substitute teacher to note where his/her\n\ncolleague has reached at any particular time with any given topic when the\n\nregular teacher is absent.\n Sometimes it also creates a much more comfortable feeling whenever a\n\nstudent or teacher leaves from one learning institution to another.\n Sometimes as the new teacher to a group of students, they usually\n\nchorus  " Miss never did that with us". \n ( As a child, I got pleasure doing that to my teachers, especially if\n\nI then realised that I had not grasped what was taught earlier.) \n\n  After all is said and done, all the students will be sitting the\n\nsame final external examinations at the end, so why can\'t we all have\n\nuniformity in whatever we pursue from the beginning? \n\n  Home Economics cannot be learnt overnight with a syllabus.\n We need to read and practice in order for us to perfect the skill.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n  a) To help the students to understand more easily and remember\n\nthings more readily. \n\n  b) To capture and hold their attention while you are teaching\n\n\n\n \n\n  We can remember anything and everything if we really want to: it\n\nall depends on how important we think it is and also how it was presented to\n\nus.\n Sometimes some things are quite complicated but when properly\n\nexplained in the simplest terms and using everyday examples one can\'t help\n\nremembering.\n For example, students usually get the exercise to classify vitamins.\n\n\n\n  " Vitamins are divided into 2 groups -\n\nwater soluble and fat soluble.\n The fat soluble vitamins are vitamins A or retinol; vitamin D or\n\nsunshine vitamin; vitamin E or tocopherol and vitamin K or Anti-haemorragic\n\nvitamin. \n\n  The water soluble vitamins are B or thiamin, vitamin C or\n\nascorbic acid, vitamin B or riboflavin etc."  \n\n  Gosh!\n\n\n  We could approach it differently.\n using a tape\n\nrecorder. \n\n  \'Once upon a time there was a man by the name of Dr.\n\nFunk, he was responsible for the discovery of vitamins. \n\n  \'He now had to make a decision to differentiate between\n\nthose vitamins which could be  dissolved  in water and those which\n\ncould be  dissolved  only in fats, so he grouped them into 2 groups\n\nbased on the experiments he carried out.\' \n Now if you want to remember the fat soluble vitamins ( those which\n\ncan be dissolved in fat) just use the letters to form a person named \n\n  \'ADEK\'    .\n very fat\n\n .\n He/She represents the fat soluble vitamins - then all the other\n\nvitamin would be water soluble - vitamin C and all the B\'s -   \'Cold\n\nBeaches\'   ( C and Bs which are associated with water). \n\n  We also need to prepare students for more difficult tasks ahead,\n\nso why not give simple, interesting practical assignments to individual\n\nstudents?\n These will help to develop skill, self-confidence, speed and also\n\nenhance the teaching- learning experience. \n\n  Each student can be allotted a specific time to complete each\n\ntask while other students look on and commend and correct if necessary. \n\n  Rewards can be given accordingly.\n As short a time as possible should be allotted; and please let them\n\nuse the correct tools. \n\n  Here are a few suggestions of simple tasks which can be done on\n\nthe spur of the moment to add variety and interest to teaching this\n\ndiscipline. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  - Demonstrating the use and care of blender; pressure cooker etc.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  - Peeling some vegetables eg. carrots, cucumber, white potato\n\netc. \n\n \n\n  - Preparing simple garnishes eg. carrot curls, egg slices, radish\n\nrose, tomato and lemon rose, chopped parsley etc. \n\n \n\n \n\n  Most home economists usually allow\n\ntheir students to prepare the famous rock cakes in their classes.\n Let us look at how we could include approximately twenty ( 20)\n\nstudents in a practical class with each student participating on his/her own,\n\nwhile his/her classmates await their turn to complete their task. \n\n  -\n The teacher could have demonstrated this item to the students in a\n\nprevious lesson. \n\n  Too often we teachers complain about lack of facilities or space\n\nto conduct a practical class,  or </l> the lack of cooperation on the\n\npart of the students to take items or ingredients to practical classes. \n\n  After the teacher does the demonstration, he/ she can go further\n\nand quiz individual students to see if he/she has grasped the concepts.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Previous Knowledge: Students saw demonstration on preparing,\n\nbaking and serving rock cakes. \n\n  : Students were told to take clean overalls,\n\nhead gear, hand towel, plate towel to class, and prepare themselves for a\n\npractical revision on rock cakes.\n\n\n  Teacher can take several different approaches to ensure that\n\nstudents carry out their tasks. \n\n  Tape recorder with instructions could be used as a teaching aid.\n\n\n\n  Students could be given each task written on pieces of paper\n\nwhich are numbered, and the students arrange accordingly to carry out their\n\ngiven tasks while their classmates and teacher look on and assess.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  6.

{'text': 'herb is any plant with a soft succulent stem or\n\nstems that die to the root each year.\n Generally, any herbaceous or woody plant which is aromatic in one\n\nor more parts, and is considered to have culinary, medicinal or\n\ncosmetic value, can be termed a herb. \n\n  Herbs can be used in many ways.\n They can be gathered and eaten raw, chopped and used as teas or ground\n\nand put in capsules or pills.\n They can be concentrated by mixing with alcohol, vinegar or water, and\n\ncan be made into ointments and poultices for surface applications to the\n\nskin. \n\n \n\n  The effectiveness and the value of most herbs is best when the\n\nplants are fresh.\n When you make your own remedies from herbs you have grown, you derive\n\na greater feeling of satisfaction. \n\n  Preparations made from herbs which have been well preserved by\n\nproper drying, storage and packaging, are also very effective. \n\n  A healthy diet and adequate exercise are important while taking\n\nherbal remedies.\n Most herbs should be taken over a period of several weeks, as herbs\n\ndo not cure overnight. \n\n \n\n \n\n  This is a hot beverage or tea made by combining the green parts\n\nor flowers of the plant with boiling water to extract its active ingredients.\n\nThe usual amounts dispensed for adults are as follows: \n\n \n\n  Half oz. to one oz. of herb to one pint of boiling water and\n\ninfuse for 5-10 minutes. \n\n \n\n  One tsp. of dried herb to one cup of boiling water infused for\n\n5-10 minutes. \n\n \n\n  This method is to extract the mineral salts and bitter elements\n\nof plants.\n The hard materials are used for this purpose, and generally boiled\n\nfor half an hour. \n\n  Half oz. of plant material to\n\none cup of water ( like chainyroot and sarsaparilla with bridal wist).\n\n\n  <p \n A wine glass of half ounce twice daily.\n A decoction or tea infusion can be stored in a refrigerator.\n\n\n\n  - This is prepared by use of alcohol to\n\nextract the active ingredients from the herb.\n Usually, one to two ounces of a herb are steeped in one pint of\n\nalcohol for several days and shaken daily.\n This is strained and the dose is one teaspoonful three times daily\n\nwith water. \n\n  aluminium\n\n  wares for making infusions   and preparations of herbs\n\nand food   is strictly forbidden.  \n Enamelware, steel pots and percolaters are best.\n\n\n utensils cause stomach ulcers, and a breakdown in chemical changes\n\nin the plant. \n\n \n\n \n\n  This is popular in European countries and our local health spas\n\nare noted for water cures.\n in St Thomas and Milk River in\n\nClarendon are renowned for their healing powers.\n However, you can prepare your own herbal bath in the privacy of your\n\nbedroom or bathroom.\n Such baths can calm and stimulate the mind and body, open pores,\n\nrelieve itching and pains.\n The herbs are tied or sewn into an old stocking and hung on your hot\n\nwater tap which is allowed to run sufficiently to give enough water so you\n\ncan sit in it and soak, for ten to fifteen minutes; or you may infuse herbs\n\nin boiling water and add to the bath.\n makes\n\nan excellent wash cloth for use in your herbal bath, as this stimulates\n\ncirculation.\n Many Jamaicans have benefitted from healing at Bath Fountain and Milk\n\nRiver, especially for arthritis, aches and pains. \n\n \n\n  A Poultice is used to draw impurities from the body by\n\napplication of moist heat.\n Bruise or crush the medicinal parts of the plant to a pulpy mass and\n\nheat.\n If you are using dry herbs, mix with hot cornmeal to make this\n\npoultice.\n Apply to the affected area.\n\n\n \n\n  Pure water blended with fragrant herbs make aromatic waters.\n They can be used as skin toners, tonic and body wash or hair rinses.\n Never use chlorinated or flouridated water when making aromatic\n\nwaters.\n Use instead pure spring water, rain water, or distilled water.\n Prepare them in ceramic or glass containers.\n Use one cup of dried herb to a pint of pure water in a quart jar with\n\na tight fitting lid.\n Put in a convenient place and shake once or twice daily for two\n\nweeks.\n\n\n \n\n  Almost any herb can be powdered and placed in a gelatin capsule.\n This offers a wide variety of ways of using such as adding hot water\n\nfor tea, making a paste for poultice, or for swallowing. \n\n \n\n  Cosmetics were made from herbal products from before the\n\nexistence of the pyramids.\n Some were bizarre made especially from animal dung.\n To make your own herbal perfume, this is one of the easiest\n\nmaterials required: Flower petals e.g. Roses, or Wood e.g. Cinnamon, Bay\n\nleaves, or oils e.g., corn or olive oil. \n\n  Place dried herbs in warm oil.\n Let it stand overnight and strain liquid through a double layer\n\nof cheese cloth, being careful to squeeze all the oil out of the cloth and\n\nback in container. \n\n  Place another supply of fresh dried herbs in the oil and leave\n\novernight.\n Repeat the straining procedure.\n Do this until fragrance of the oil is strong enough to your suit.\n\n\n\n  Use an equal amount of unscented alcohol to the\n\noil.\n Shake vigorously once a day for two weeks.\n Allow the alcohol to separate from the oil.\n and\n\ncap tightly.\n The oil can be used as a bath oil or used in soaps.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  Jamaicans are very skin conscious and spend elaborately to\n\ngain or keep a smooth and beautiful skin.\n\n\n  are among the most\n\ncommon problems in skin care.\n When the slightest imbalance of hormones occurs, the sebaceous\n\nglands send up extra sebum through the pores.\n\n\ncomes a blackhead when oxidised by air.\n Herbal drinks and vegetable juices are very useful for this\n\ncondition. \n\n  5 ozs. carrot, 2 ozs. lettuce, 1\n\noz. spinach ( Callaloo), ½ oz. parsley.  \n\n \n\n  This is necessary to remove\n\nimpurities.\n Boil a pint of water and pour 2 tbls. of any complexion herb;

levels to have their blood tested at least once per year. \n\n \n\n  Lead can only harm a child if it gets into the body.\n\n\n  Some children already have lead in their blood because of bad\n\nhabits. \n\n  Children should not be allowed to play in yards where the soil\n\nis high in lead.\n It is easy to inhale lead when dust is blowing around.\n They can swallow it when they eat dirt, suck their fingers or put\n\ndirty toys and soothers in their mouths. \n\n  Children can also get lead from mangoes and other fruits which\n\nhave not been properly washed. \n\n  It is also dangerous for them to touch dirty pets or other\n\nanimals which live outdoors.\n Dogs and goats may have a lot of dust in their fur.\n Even chickens and pigeons are likely to store dust in

{'text': 'The lightning protector that runs down the side of your house, and\n\nwhich starts just above the line of the roof, is very important for your\n\nsafety.\n People sometimes just look at this metal protuberance and wonder what\n\nit is for. \n\n  Like many Jamaicans, as youngsters we heard that this was\n\n \'lightning protector,\'  which helps to prevent the\n\n   house   from being set on fire by of\n\nlightning.\n Basically this should be located with the top of the metal protruding\n\nabove the highest point of the house. \n\n  Simply put, the lightning protector conducts the lightning\n\nfrom the roof to the ground.\n\n\n  In this time of high electricity costs, energy saving is very\n\nimportant to the householder.\n One way of conserving is to buy energy-efficient appliances.\n Some people are turned off by such appliances by a simple factor \x13\n\nthey are usually more expensive than their less efficient brothers.\n Looking at it from a long term point of view, however, you will\n\nrealise that in this case the cheapest turns out to be the dearest.\n Bear in mind that electricity rates have increased by as much as 400\n\nper cent in the last year alone.\n The Jamaican Public Service Company can also increase rates any\n\ntime it feels like. \n\n  Take your refridgerator.\n You need not turn the temperature setting to the highest one.\n\n\nble, to a setting that still freezes water and keeps the food from spoiling.\n\n\n\n  To check if the rubber gasket around the door of your fridge is\n\nstill doing the work for which it is intended \x13 keeping the cool air in and\n\nthe hot air out \x13 place a piece of paper in the door as you close it.\n If it comes out easily it is time to change or tighten the gasket.\n\n\n\n  The coils at the back of your fridge needs air circulating around\n\nthem to operate efficiently.\n Clean them periodically of any debris that might gather there.\n therfore\n\n  therefore   , will also increase electricity\n\nconsumption. \n\n  The freezer operates more efficiently when full.\n Therefore, when there is not enough food in it, you can save energy\n\nby putting in containers of water. \n\n  Cooking gas is one product we can control the use of easily.\n Once the cylinder is not leaking, and the gas is turned off\n\novernight, the only other factor that will contribute to its length of\n\neffective service is the way it is used.\n Meals such as porridge cook within a short time.\n Don\'t cook them too long.\n Vegetables too, need not be overcooked.\n Also, check this; once the pot is boiling, the flame can be turned\n\ndown, since additional heat will not make it hotter. \n\n  The iron is perhaps the greatest energy user in your house,\n\nunless you have a water heater.\n To save energy, trying ironing as much of your clothes as possible at\n\none time.\n Iron the same materials at the same time, starting from the coolest\n\nto the hottest setting.\n\n\n  Changing the light bulbs is one sure and immediate way of\n\neffecting a reduction in energy use.\n Although energy saving bulbs are more expensive, the savings\n\nmake them cheaper over time.\n Fluorescent bulbs are excellent energy savers and do not make the\n\nrooms as hot.\n Never forget, too, that a fluorescent bulb can last ten times as long\n\nas its incandescent relative.\n Cleaning the sockets into which bulbs are screwed will also make\n\noperation more efficient.\n Of course you will remember to turn the switches off before cleaning\n\nthe sockets!  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  2.

\n\n  On the other hand, authorised dealers who represent auto\n\ncompanies in Jamaica, and who normally bring in new vehicles, can import used\n\nmodels of the vehicles they sell.\n For example, as the authorised dealers for Toyota in Jamaica, United\n\nMotors can import used Toyotas into the country under the recently\n\nrevised Policy. \n\n  A used car dealer like any other Jamaican over eighteen years of\n\nage, is allowed to import two motor vehicles every three years.\n These dealers, however, are able to legally import vehicles for\n\nindividuals, if the import licence for the vehicle is in the name of the\n\nindividual for whom the vehicle is being imported. \n\n  Mrs\n\nElsa Binns, director of the Motor Vehicle Import Policy in the Ministry of\n\nTransport, told the  Auto Feature  .\n " They import vehicles for customers, but the licences\n\nare in the  names."  \n\n \n\n  Under the Policy, the individual importer has the choice of\n\nimporting a car and a light commercial vehicle ( such as a pick-up), or\n\ntwo light commercial vehicles if he chooses.\n Non-Jamaicans over the age of 18 may also import vehicles into\n\nthe island upon proof of landed immigration status, such as a work\n\npermit. \n\n  People who benefit from duty concessions, including teachers,\n\ndoctors and civil servants, must, upon application to the Trade Board for an\n\nImport Licence, also submit an Order and Clearance Permit in his/her\n\nname, along with documentary evidence of eligibility for such con <l>\n\ncessions.\n Information on how to import a vehicle into Jamaica is available in\n\na brochure, from the Trade Board.\n The entire procedure is detailed in Ministry Paper\n#4 1993, approved by Cabinet on January 18.\n\n\n  February   1, 1993. \n\n  Nowadays there are several ways of saving money when you finally\n\nmake a decision to purchase a vehicle.\n A used car dealer will be able to assist you in locating a\n\nvehicle, getting a licence, and also save you the tedious task of\n\nclearing it through customs. \n\n \n\n  This, of course will cost you extra, but many people gladly pay\n\nfor the convenience of having an  " expert"  deal with\n\nthe  " red tape"  involved in getting a vehicle into this\n\ncountry. \n\n  Some people have opted to go abroad \x13 particularly to the United\n\nStates and Britain \x13 to get vehicles offered for sale at auctions and auto\n\nsales put on by dealerships.\n At these events, vehicles are sometimes given away in Jamaican\n\nparlance.\n Police auctions in particular, at which seized vehicles are\n\nsold at nominal costs, are good sources of cheap vehicles. \n\n  The term " " write-off" " for insurance\n\npurposes of a motor vehicle in United States, means something other than what\n\nit means in Jamaica.\n Here, it usually means that it would cost the insurance company\n\nmore to fix the damaged car than to replace it.\n As those of you who have travelled know, a written-off car in the\n\nUnited States often has just a damaged rear section, has one side crushed in\n\nan accident, or in some cases is one for which the parts are not immediately\n\navailable. \n\n  It can be profitable to go abroad and buy a car that has been\n\nwritten off, provided that the cost of repair plus the cost of the car\n\njustifies the purchase. \n\n \n\n  "\n\ndamaged"  cars.\n You can therefore not expect duty concessions for bringing in one of\n\nthese units. \n\n  Lastly, while there are laws governing the sale of vehicles in\n\nthe United States and any other market you might choose to visit, you\n\nhave to be careful that you do not end up spending your well-earned money on\n\na piece of junk, sold to you and delivered to the port of exit by a    dealer   who feels he will have exported the  "\n\nsalad"  he could not sell in his own country. \n\n \n\nantees, and the terms " " as is, where is" " with no\n\nrecourse usually apply.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  1990 CHAMPION DRIVER Douglas Donald, Mao Lee, Mark Evans and\n\nMitta Rousseau were the most successful drivers at last Sunday\'s Go Kart\n\nrace meet, held at the Palisadoes International Raceway. \n\n  They all won two races, to improve their chances as they look\n\ntowards winning the 1993  championship. \n\n  One highlight of the meet was shared by Tony Chin and Mike\n\nSimmons who won the Light and Heavy Yamaha sections, respectively, in\n\nthe afternoon\'s feature events \x13 the Pepsi Open races. \n\n  It was Simmons third consecutive victory in the Light\n\nevent.\n He drove a tactical race to beat 16 year-old driving sensation Rory\n\nCase into second place. \n\n  Donald, however showed some signs of his former years, when he\n\nregistered an impressive win in the third Heavy Yamaha race.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'cb2d3571-0888-4dc5-92a4-9275451061ad', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.478107+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9597330689430237, 'non_english_score': 0.04026693105697632}
{'text': 'IN a previous article I gave a recipe for home-made thick cream.\n To make a pouring cream, the unsalted butter is reduced by half and is\n\nthen made in exactly the same way as for thick cream.\n If unsalted butter is unavailable, one can de-salt salted butter\n\n\x13 here\'s how: \n\n  Place 100g salted butter in approximately 1/2 litre of water in a\n\npan.\n Bring to the boil and stir continually for 2-3 minutes.\n Remove from heat and allow to cool undisturbed until the butter has\n\nformed a crust on top of the water.\n\n\nsalted butter.\n Store in a jar with a tightly fitted lid for a few days \x13 if it is\n\nnot eaten up on the first day!\n This cream is ideal for use with most recipes that call for either\n\nthick cream or pouring cream and is much more economical than buying com\n\n<l> mercially packaged cream \x13 with a plus that there are no preservatives\n\nand other additives. \n\n \n\n  A similar method to making cream may be employed to make an ice\n\ncream: to make 3-4 servings of Vanilla ice cream you will need: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  METHOD: Place the butter, milk and sugar in a saucepan and heat\n\nslowly until the butter has melted, allow it to just come to the boil.\n If using a microwave oven to heat the mixture, place the ingredients\n\nin a large heat-proof measuring jug and heat on HIGH for 3-4 minutes, or\n\nuntil the butter has melted and the milk beads round the edges.\n If you are using a cream maker attachment on your mixer, follow\n\nthe instructions, otherwise, transfer the mixture to a blender and whirl\n\nuntil thoroughly mixed, at least one minute.\n Stir in the vanilla essence and when quite cool, pour into freezer\n\ntray or other suitable container.\n ( To save on time and washing up, freeze mixture in a wide-necked\n\nplastic tub, then it may be whisked, preferable with a hand held electric\n\nbeater, in the same container.)\n Freeze until there is 2.5 cm solid film round edge.\n Scrape mixture into bowl and whisk until the mixture has thickened\n\nand is smooth.\n\n\n \n\n  For Strawberry or Raspberry: ice cream, add 100 g fresh, canned\n\nor frozen fruit \n\n  For Orange, Lime or Lemon: add the grated rind of the fruit and\n\n40 ml of the juice \n\n \n\n \n\n  Peppermint, add a few drops of peppermint essence and a few drops\n\ngreen colouring \n\n \n\n  To obtain the different flavours, make up the recipe as\n\nabove, omitting the vanilla, to the stage where the mixture is well blended,\n\nadd the fruit or flavouring and blend for 30 seconds.\n\n\n \n\n  The amount of ingredients given only makes a small amount, it is\n\nmuch more economical of time to double up \x13 or even triple or quadruple\n\n\x13 the ingredients.\n If your blender is large enough, it takes no longer to make a\n\nlarger amount than a smaller. \n\n \n\n  Make a banana split with a scoop of the vanilla ice cream, a\n\ndollop of the thick cream and a sprinkle of chopped nuts. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Turn ordinary coffee into Viennese Coffee with the addition\n\nof thick cream \n\n \n\n  Of course, all these suggestions are taboo if you are on a\n\ndiet!\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ning down the face, eyes smarting and of a vegetable that enhances the flavour\n\nof food.  \n\n  Onions widely used in Jamaica goes way back to ancient Egypt.\n\n\n\n  It is said onions in the Middle Ages were as valuable as gold.\n They were used to prevent scurvy on long ocean voyages in the 18 th\n\ncentury. \n\n  The medical community has associated a long list of medical\n\nbenefits to the onion. \n\n  "\n\nthe greater the consumption of vegetables in the onion family ( including\n\ngarlic, escallions and chives), the lower the risk of stomach cancer."\n\n \n\n  In addition, the India Journal of Medical Science says studies\n\nreveal that eating onions can reduce cholesterol levels in the blood and\n\nhelp stop dangerous clotting due to the presence of the chemical Adenosine,\n\nwhich is found naturally in onions. \n\n  Another chemical found in onions is Quercetin.\n This is said to be a powerful anti-oxidant which has the ability to\n\nneutralise  " free radicals"  in the body which are linked to\n\ntissue damage. \n\n  Onions, according to research conducted by chemists at East Texas\n\nState University can also lower blood pressure.\n This is due to the presence of another chemical Prostaglandin A1.\n\n\n\n  A medium-sized onion, in addition to having twice the\n\nvitamin C of an apple and about the same as an orange, is considered to be an\n\nexcellent source of fibre.\n It only has 60 calories, ( good news for weight watchers) and it has\n\nno cholesterol and no fat. \n\n  The key to storing onions is to keep them cool, dry and separate.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Peel onions and slice thinly.\n Add onions, allspice, cinnamon and ginger to saucepan.\n Cook with a little oil stirring often for approximately 10 minutes.\n Stir in honey, sugar and vinegar.\n Continue cooking and stirring for another 5 minutes.\n Spoon the preserves into a bowl and let cool.\n The preserves may be stored, tightly covered, indefinitely in the\n\nrefrigerator.\n Serve hot with any grilled meat or fish; in omelets or with ham and\n\neggs. \n\n  Serve cold with cold sliced meat or chicken.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  SO WHAT do you do for protein? That\'s one of the first\n\nquestions people ask me when they first find out that I am a vegetarian.\n Many people seem to think that meats are the only sources of protein.\n\n\n  Proteins are building blocks that build and repair our tissues.\n The building blocks that the body cannot make must be present in our\n\nfood every day. \n\n  And just how much of these building blocks do we need?\n Less than you\'ve probably heard.\n Women need about 40 - 45 grams of protein each day.\n\n\n  Natural sources of protein are dried peas and beans, whole\n\ngrains, nuts and seeds.\n\n\n \n\ntein.\n A half cup of cooked cereal ( or three-quarter cup of dry) has two to\n\nthree grams of protein.\n A slice of bread contains two and a half to three grams.\n A half cup of beans has seven grams.\n\n\n  Any combination of nut and legume or peas; legume and grain; or\n\nnut and grain will provide you with all your protein requirement. \n\n  Nuts are coming largely into use to take the place of meats.\n With nuts may be combined grains, fruits and some roots to make\n\nfoods that are healthy and nourishing.\n It should be remembered too that some nuts are not as wholesome\n\nas others.\n Almonds are preferable to peanuts, but peanuts in limited quantities\n\nused in combination with grains are nourishing digestible. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Sauté first four ingredients lightly.\n Whirl broad beans in blender with enough water or broth to turn\n\nblender easily.\n Mix all ingredients.\n Bake in greased casserole dish at 170 &degree; C ( 350 &degree; F)\n\nfor about one hour.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  A tin product that can be just what you need after a hard day\'s\n\nwork Madam Housewife, is Grace Red Peas in Brine.\n The 10-ounce product will cost you\n\n$13.50.  The pulse is combined with salt and water and it is already\n\ncooked, so if you follow the directions on the tin, you will come up with a\n\nwinner whatever dish you choose to use the pulse to prepare. \n\n \n\n  Golden-fleshed pumpkin, most of good quality, is easy to come by\n\nin retail markets in downtown Kingston\'s retail outlets.\n The parish capitals have the vegetable favourite in good supply\n\ntoo.\n The per-pound cost remains at the\n\n$6 to which the foodstuff climbed a few weeks ago.\n Pumpkin makes colourful addition to the vegetatable soup or any\n\nsoup for that matter and may be the base of tasty fritters or pies. \n\n \n\n  A savoury delight that you can spread on the biscuits or bread\n\nfor the mid- morning snack or afternoon tea, or for the picnic basket is\n\nMiracle Solomon Gundy.\n The 133 gram bottle will cost in the region of\n\n$35.65.  The product is a mixture of smoked red herring, cho\n\ncho, escallion, sugar, acetic acid, onion, pepper, caramel, vegetable\n\noil, approved spices, sodium benzoate and anti-oxidants. \n\n \n\n  Ripe plantains for baking, frying, boiling or as the\n\nfilling for those scrumptious plantain tarts, are in good supply at this time\n\nin most rural as well as urban markets.\n The per-finger price will depend on where you buy and from whom you\n\nmake your purchase.\n The fruit-food starts at\n\n$1.50 per-finger and can soar to as high as\n\n$5 depending  <-> or <->  on   size. \n\n \n\n  One of the most favoured staples for the soup whatever the\n\nvariety, is coco.\n The two varieties are on offer in retail markets in rural areas and\n\nthe per-pound price differs by about\n\n$1.00.  Soft coco, the less costly of the two can extract between\n\n$4 and\n\n$5 for a pound from your spending money, but the hard variety sells at not\n\nless than\n\n$6 wherever you make your purchase. \n\n \n\n  A delightful meat product which won\'t cost you very much and\n\nwhich is easy to obtain in supermarkets as well as meatshops and retail\n\nmarket butcher stalls is Cow Foot. \n\n  The per-pound price varies with buying-place.\n the price\n\ncan be\n\n$21.00 and in the supermarkets it varies between\n\n$21 and\n\n$22.

and night-dreams, too, for they are also a part of life,\n\nstrange, puzzling, perhaps revealing, but there to be enjoyed. \n\n \n Enjoy all your hopes, of course, and relish your happy memories: they\n\ntoo can be cultivated to enrich life.\n But real life is only now, the rest in vanished or shrouded in\n\nunknowable mist.\n Live for the present, and in the present, relishing every moment.\n\n\n \n Far, far too many people bemoaning that life isn\'t offering them much\n\nare simply not putting enough into it.\n The world owes no one a living, so why should anyone expect to draw\n\non the bank of life without making any deposits there.\n Plunge in, give all you can, venture and try ( and probably surprise\n\nyourself), give out to others, have a go, don\'t think too much of yourself\n\nand  " what\'s in it for me?" \n The more you put into life, the more life will give you back \x13 with\n\ninterest.\n It\'s as simple as that.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  LIFE has its own time table.\n It takes nine months to make a baby and 18 years to make an adult.\n It takes a long time and practice to become a good piano player or\n\nracing car driver.\n It takes time to become a success and even more time to become a\n\nsuccess as a person. \n\n  We need to try to become more patient and develop various simple\n\nbut workable approaches to calm ourselves in this world of stress, strain and\n\npain.\n Many will tell you it\'s a difficult thing to remain calm based on the\n\neconomic circumstances.\n But at least we can try.\n As a matter of fact, this may not transform one into a model of\n\npatience but it could help to eliminate the impatience from our lives and\n\ncontrol most of it. \n\n  " Patience is needed with everyone, but first of all with\n\nourselves,"  says Saint Francis De Sales.\n One of the good things about problems is that a good many of them do\n\nnot exist except in our imaginations.\n\n\n  If there is a need for one to be calm then read on &dotted-line;\n\n\n  1.

Be prepared.\n An unprepared person is usually an unsuccessful person.\n Neither should one procrastinate as delay is danger.\n Waiting in the post office line or the bank on a payday \x13 Friday\n\nafternoon is no fun.\n The only consolation is that there is gain after the pain of the\n\nwait.\n The wait is probably done for reason not by choice.\n Take a book of crossword puzzles to do while you wait patiently, or\n\nbring along an interesting novel or romance magazine to read.\n\n\n  4. Don\'t race into the future impatiently.\n Just live in the here and now.\n This will enable you to enjoy the many good things life has to\n\noffer.\n We must not ignore the fact that the world is ours to be enjoyed to\n\nits fullest, but not specially created for our convenience. \n\n  5. Always think ahead.\n Traffic jams and road construction obstacles are less likely to\n\nirritate you if you are not    hungry   ,\n\nthirsty or too hot.\n Eat something before leaving home.\n If possible, take a snack along with you.\n People who are impatient do not like to waste precious time.\n They cut things close.\n They budget the exact number of minutes that a journey should take.\n They do not necessarily allow for the possibility of delays or the\n\nunexpected. \n\n  To give a famous writer the last words.\n " There are three steps to accomplishment: Plan\n\nPurposefully, Prepare Positively, Pursue Persistently."   \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  PLANNING FOR the big day in Jamaica has now become quite\n\nsophisticated, with an increasing number of wedding expositions taking place.\n\n \n\n  The term is a fairly new one, to local show goers.\n Some may wonder why it is necessary to put on a big exposition\n\njust to showcase a wedding.\n I recently attended a recent expo and discovered its tremendous\n\nadvantage to wedding planners. \n\n  First of all, the sheer beauty and fairy tale atmosphere of\n\nthese shows is probably unrivalled by any other.\n You would never imagine how many aspects there are to putting\n\ntogether a wedding until you see all services and products together on\n\ndisplay. \n\n  Topping the list is wedding consultancy \x13 an innovative,\n\nprofessional advisory for clients who wish to be advised what to do and\n\nhow to plan, plus where to go for what, and how much it will all cost. \n\n  On display at the expo are bridal registries, caterers, cake\n\ndesigners, decorators, florists, video specialists, photographers,\n\njewellers, souvenirs, beauticians and musicians \x13 the array is\n\nextensive. \n\n  On hand for discussions are honeymoon package tour\n\noperators and even building societies.\n For diversity in taste, there is an outdoor garden\n\nboasting champagne fountains and ice carvings.\n To top it off, a grand fashion show to parade the latest designs in\n\nbridal wear, which is altogether, very entertaining. \n\n  ANOTHER STROKE of sophistication is the total wedding\n\npackage, which provides all the various services and products.  \n\n  After taking in all the displays, plus, receiving all the advice\n\nfrom consultants, the real task of planning is yet to be done.\n Traditionally the engaged couple take a do-it-yourself ( DIY)\n\napproach to planning, usually on their own, or with some help from close\n\nrelatives and friends.\n For getting everything in place in the given time, the DIY approach\n\ncan be very exhausting and time consuming. \n\n  In order to take the strain and hassle out of planning, the all\n\ninclusive wedding centres are now offering the total package.\n All the planning for anything related to the wedding is taken\n\ncare of, thus offering the maximum convenience to the bride and groom. \n\n  An interesting story is told by Classique Wedding Centre, the\n\npioneers of the total package arrangement.\n It reveals that, due to the hectic pace of life, more and more\n\npeople are turning to this type of service. \n\n  Clients can come in at very short notice and manage to get\n\neverything done for them on time \x13 an added advantage is that all aspects of\n\npreparation can be checked in one location.\n\n\nseas who do not have to visit the centre during preparations.\n Importantly, the package is tailor-made to suit the pocket of every\n\n<l> one. \n\n  From a carpenter to a diplomat.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  THE BIG day finally arrives when all the extensive\n\nplanning and preparation comes to a climax.  \n\n  Wedding costumes are crisply laid out, bouquets and flowers\n\ndelivered, wedding cars gleaming and decorated, catering arrangements\n\nfinalized, beauticians have done their jobs, cakes are ready, wedding\n\nsouvenirs selected, presents wrapped and about to be delivered. \n\n \n\n  At the designated time, relatives and guests arrive at church.\n Everyone is on time so as not to inconvenience the next bridal\n\nparty.\n The music starts and the procession begins.\n The bridegroom takes his place at the from pew, seated beside his\n\nbest man. \n\n  The bridesmaids take their place opposite the groomsmen, and the\n\nushers doing their thing.\n Relatives of the bride sit in the front pews opposite relatives of\n\nthe groom.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b348d2c2-d775-49c7-9b50-1728807061f2', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.481062+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9688347578048706, 'non_english_score': 0.031165242195129395}
{'text': 'As you look back over the previous sections that we have dealt\n\nwith, it may surprise you to find that all the  " optimizing\n\ndecisions"  - the choices which bring the most progress toward the\n\nchosen objectives \x13 are marginal decisions.\n The same would be true for all economic units, all people, all\n\nbusinesses, all organizations, all societies, all nations. \n\n  " marginal"\n\n choices?\n Suppose each little choice, each little move, each little bit of some\n\n<l> thing used up, is used so that it does as much good as possible.\n If each choice leads to the best possible move in the best possible\n\ndirection, then all these little  " best moves"  must take us\n\nto the best possible place. \n\n  If you really optimize each little bit of your time and money and\n\nthings, then you are doing the best you possibly do.\n Wherever you want to go to, you can get there as fast as possible, by\n\nmaking the right possible choice, two    or   three\n\nhours before your appointed time. \n\n  The wisdom of thinking marginally \x13 of breaking down the big\n\nchoices into many choices - is not new.\n Some 200 years ago Benjamin Franklyn told us that we should take care\n\nof our pennies \x13 that if we did, our dollars would take care of themselves.\n " marginal thinking"\n\n is just good common sense.\n Still, it is a very important concept.\n Every day small businesses fail and people do foolish things just\n\nbecause they do no know how, or do not bother to  " think marginally."\n\n \n\n  is sort of\n\n " fine tuning." \n The idea is that you start from where you are and then consider\n\nmaking little adjustments to see if you might come out better.\n Suppose you are running a factory.\n " If I expand my output by one unit per day\n\nhow much to my daily revenue?\n If you think the marginal revenue will be greater than the\n\nmarginal cost, you will expand your output.\n No matter what your situation was before, you are bound to be\n\nbetter off, make more profit, after you expand your output. \n\n  Suppose Mr. X, your friendly neighbourhood grocer is thinking\n\nabout spending\n\n$100 a month on advertising.\n How does he decide?\n If he thinks he will get enough extra revenue to more than cover the\n\ncost, the\n\n$100 advertising expense, then he will spend the money.\n If he doesn\'t think the advertising will pay off, he won\'t spend\n\nthe money. \n\n  At any moment, most of a business manager\'s choices have\n\nalready been made, at least for the time being.\n Mr. X has already paid for his store.\n Most of his equipment is bought and paid for.\n He has not paid his taxes yet, but he is going to.\n He doesn\'t have much choice about that.\n What choices can he make on a day-to-day basis?\n Marginal choices.\n He makes them everyday.\n Every hour.\n Every minute.\n These little moment-to-moment choices are the decisions which will\n\ndetermine whether his business will make money or lose money\x13 whether he will\n\nprosper, just barely hang on, or go broke. \n\n  What are these little choices he makes?\n He must decide: whether to use a little more shelf space for Pepsi\n\nand little less for Coke; whether to run a  \'special\'  this\n\nweek on chicken or on beef; whether to run a little ad or a big one in tomor\n\n<l> row\'s paper; whether to charge more for cold beer than for warm beer, or\n\nwhether to continue to close at 11 p.m. or to stay open until midnight; and\n\ndozens of other little decisions. \n\n  All of Mr. X\'s marginal choices are important.\n Some are critical.\n His most critical choices are likely to be the same as yours and\n\nmine.\n What choices?\n\n\neach little unit of time. \n\n  Should he spend his next five minutes sweeping the sidewalk?\n Catching up on his book keeping?\n Being friendly and helpful to the new customer who just came in?\n Planning next week\'s promotion?\n Or re- stocking the shelves?\n\n\n  If Mr.X makes the right choices on most of these little\n\nmarginal decisions, he is likely to have a successful, profitable\n\nbusiness.\n He will serve his neighbourhood well, and for that he will be\n\nrewarded with profits.\n But if he makes too many of the wrong marginal choices, soon his\n\nstore will be up for sale.\n Truly, in the success of a business, it\'s the little things that\n\ncount. \n\n  It\'s easy to see how thinking marginally applies to the business\n\nmanager.\n It\'s just about as easy to see how it applies to almost any other\n\n " choice situation"  you can imagine.\n\n\n  When you are washing the car, or the dishes, or the kitchen\n\nfloor, or when you\'re mowing the lawn, or ironing a shirt or skirt, or\n\nstudying economics, how much time and effort should you put into each task?\n That\'s up to you.\n But you can be quite sure that you will optimize by thinking\n\nmarginally.\n That means doing a job well enough to meet your own personal\n\nobjectives. \n\n  Intuitively, all intelligent people think marginally, more or\n\nless.\n It\'s just good common sense.\n But once in awhile it\'s a good idea to stop and remind ourselves that\n\nwe really do have a choice about how to spend each five minutes during each\n\nday, how to spend each dollar we have, how to use each thing we have \x13 and\n\nthat success in college, and in life, depends very much on how wisely we make\n\nthese little choices. \n\n  means to make each little\n\nchoice so it will do you the <space> most good.\n It means each time you spend each extra bit of effort or time or\n\nmoney or anything, make it do the best it can, for you.\n It means to optimize the use of everything you have to work with.\n " at the margin"\n\n and of concentrating on this  " marginal trade off" \n\nis easy to see, once you start to think about it.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  A devastating blow for anyone, especially someone who has\n\nstruggled most of the time life to gain independence after a lifetime of\n\nsickness.\n But for Michelle Motta, this was a new challenge, another\n\nfight she had to win. \n\n  Michelle\'s battle to save her sight began in 1991.\n Though she opted to learn braille, she was not about to give up her\n\nsight without a fight.\n In August that year, she had her first operation to re-attach\n\nher retina; and in June 1993, the fourth, an introcular lens implant in the\n\nright eye, after the removal of a cataract. \n\n  In spite of the constant struggle for life, the limitations\n\nand numerous setbacks, including having to drop out of the MBA programme at\n\nthe UWI, Michelle always tries to look at the good things in life, and\n\nas her brother is said, she is always thinking of those worse off than\n\nherself. \n\n  Diagnosed with diabetes at age six, Michelle spent most of her\n\nchildhood from one hospital to the next, one clinic to another.\n Yet she never lost hope or the faith that she could survive.\n After countless hospitalisations, four eye operations \x13 another is\n\ndue in December \x13 and surviving a coma, the bubbling 30-year-old Senior\n\nProject Officer at Jamaica Agricultural Development Foundation ( JADF)\n\nis rearing to go. \n\n  Michelle was born in Manchester and grew up at Grove Place,\n\none of the Government\'s agricultural research stations where her father\n\nworked.\n Since her diagnoses, not a year has passed that she has not spent\n\ntime in hospital:  \'one day up, the next day down.\' \n\n\n \n\n  Michelle\'s determination to succeed could be the reason she is\n\nalive. \n\n  At 12, she fell into a diabetic coma and missed a lot of school,\n\nbut like the many times before, she was able to catch-up.\n Her 91-year-old grandmother, Edna Minott, has been a source of\n\nstrength and inspiration, Michelle says: there when she is most needed -\n\nunderstanding the problems and helping her to deal with them. \n\n  levels at\n\nManchester High and after graduation worked for a year at Alcan, while she\n\ndecided what she really wanted to do. \n\n \n\ntitis and it was while in hospital bed that she applied for a place at the\n\nFaculty of Agriculture at the University of the West  St.\n\nAugustine campus. \n\n  Agriculture was not, however, her first choice.\n She wanted to do Geology.\n Michelle recalls collecting everything from shells and stones to\n\ndriftwood.\n She succeeded in gaining a place in both the Agriculture faculty and\n\nthe Geology Department but her health would not allow her to continue in her\n\nchosen field. \n\n  Michelle is from a farming background \x13 her grandfather, father\n\nand even her brother, are farmers.\n Her father Sam, is her mentor, she says, but although she is the\n\nfirst to admit that farm life contributed a great deal to the person she is\n\ntoday, Michelle insists that her family had nothing to do with her ca <l>\n\nreer choice. \n\n \n\nbecause of her courage and determination to succeed in spite of the\n\ndifficulties and setbacks.\n And for the past seven years, she has proven that she is able to take\n\ncare of herself.\n Most of her free time she spends visiting the elderly or\n\nenjoying the peace and quiet of rural Jamaica.\n\n\n  Michelle\'s job allows her to do what she likes best: helping\n\npeople.\n She works with men and women who are seeking funding for their\n\nagricultural projects through the JADF.\n When they get the loans, she monitors their progress.\n Her training and background allows her to give advice where and\n\nwhen it is needed.\n And she does her job well \x13 a few years ago she was Employee of the\n\nYear. \n\n  Michelle hopes that one day she will be able to manage or own\n\nher very own farm.\n In the meantime, however, she will continue to help others set up\n\nand run theirs productively and profitably.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  NOT all the technology we now use involves the use of sophisti\n\n<l> cated equipment or require complex solutions.\n A simple fly trap from the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean\n\ndemonstrates how a fairly easy trap can be adapted for use anywhere. \n\n  This fly trap is used to catch stable flies, blood-sucking\n\ninsects that carry disease to cows and other livestock.\n First of all, the cows are kept in the dark sheds because flies like\n\nto be where there is light.\n Some flies, however get into the dark shed and bother the cows\n\nanyway.\n\n\n  To build the trap, first get 12 pieces of wood.\n Each stick of wood should be 1 centimetre square and 45 centimetres\n\nlong.\n Make a wooden frame the shape of a box with these sticks of wood.\n You may also use heavy wire to make the frame.\n Cover each side of the box with fine nylon netting.\n Cut a small hole, about 2 centimetres wide, in the netting at the\n\ncentre of one side of the box. \n\n  Where would the trap be put?\n You must cut a hole exactly the same size as the box-in one wall of\n\nyour cow shed.\n The hole should be at least one metre above the floor.\n Then push the nylon box into the hole in the wall of the shed.\n Push it only half way, so that half of the box is inside the shed\n\nand half is outside the shed.\n\n\n  Stable flies always try to fly towards the light.\n The flies in the barn will see the light coming through the box\n\nand will fly over it.\n They will want to fly right through the box to the outside where\n\nthere is more light.\n The flies will walk or fly around the netting trying to find a way\n\nthrough.\n Then they will fly toward the outer wall of nylon netting.\n But they cannot fly through it.\n The flies do not want to flyback toward the darkness of the cow\n\nshed, so it is unlikely that they    will   find\n\ntheir way out of the trap through the small hole that you made.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'cca9ad64-32f2-401c-8ac4-1cda1076fd65', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.482292+00:00',

{'text': 'CHURCH AND STATE  \n\n \n\n  IT is quite wrong to believe that the ecclesiastical structures of\n\nChristianity have mostly been benefactors of society.\n The churches have more often than not stood on the side of injustice,\n\nignorance and oppression than they have stood against these indignities to\n\nthe spirit and ideals of man.\n This is a fact of history, and should be a cause of very great\n\nembarrassment for the Christian religion at large as it is for this humble\n\nbeliever. \n\n  Where the churches have done \'good\', to society in the liberal\n\ndemocratic sense of the word, they have done so either as an outflow of\n\nspasms of internal reformation and revival or as a belated response to social\n\nrevolutions which were launched by essentially secular men. \n\n  Christianity has generally handled political power badly, using\n\nthe sword of the state as an instrument of coercion rather than as a tool of\n\nliberation.\n This is not a matter of purely historical concern.\n The question of Church and State relationship is a living question of\n\nthe historic present.\n Historical analysis must therefore be called upon to provide rational\n\nguidance on how to proceed in this delicate arena.\n It is extremely rash and foolish to discount the clear testimony of\n\nhistory and to assume that in this enlightened present the churches cannot be\n\nallied to the forces of injustice, ignorance and oppression as they were\n\nrepeatedly in the past. \n\n  Let us draw lessons from our own West Indian history, before\n\ngoing further afield:\n There is no question at all that the established churches supported\n\nslavery, and more than that, that they provided the theological justification\n\nfor the practice which began purely out of the economic \'necessity\' for\n\nlabour in the colonies. \n\n \n\n  Much ado is made by the historians of the efforts of the\n\nnon-conformist missionaries in the fight against slavery and in the\n\nestablishment of a free peasantry.\n Credit must be given where credit is due.\n But we must accurately note that the philosophical roots of the anti\n\n - <?/> slavery movement originated in the Enlightenment with its lofty,\n\nsecular humanist views of the dignity of man, of liberty and of justice, and\n\nits rejection of the static hierarchical system of social organization which\n\nwas supported by the state churches of Europe.\n The spirit of the Enlightenment infused the Christian reformation\n\nmovements of the time such as Methodism, led by the Wesley brothers, which\n\nthen fought for the ideals of humanism. \n\n  The abolitionists were first and foremost humanists and\n\nhumanitarians and secondarily, for some of them like Wilberforce, Christians.\n\n\n\n  Historian Eric Williams devoted a whole chapter of his book\n\nCapitalism and Slavery to  " The  \'Saints\' and Slavery"\n\n , and makes the point: \n " The humanitarians were the spearhead of the onslaught which\n\ndestroyed the West Indian System and freed the Negro"  .\n " the\n\nultimate end of human society - the security of life, property and reputation\n\n- must be preferred to its subordinate ends - the enjoyment of particular\n\nfranchises"  ( like owning slaves). \n\n  Stephen\'s Colonial Office memorandum reads much like the\n\npreambles of the American Declaration of Independence and Constitution which\n\nwere drawn up several years before by men who were essentially humanistic in\n\ntheir outlook. \n\n  The riddle of the differential prosperity of North America and\n\nLatin America is best unlocked by examining differences in the historic power\n\nof the churches on both sides of the Rio Grande. \n\n \n\n  A secular democratic constitution has underpinned the\n\nconstruction of the greatest nation the world has yet seen, ( judged from the\n\nvantage point of the underdog man).\n While, with similar resources of land and people, its southern\n\nneighbours have some of the greatest disparities, in land distribution, in\n\nwealth, education, privilege, and power with the church being the largest\n\nsingle landowner. \n\n  Nor should we forget that the most powerful churchman of the time\n\nof the formulation of the American constitution declared that that document -\n\nthe prototype charter of democratic freedoms everywhere - was full of  "\n\npestilential errors"  . \n\n  We must of course also remember that, despite its magnificent\n\ncharter of freedom, the United States remained a slave holding state, with\n\nchurch support, until 1863 when President Lincoln proclaimed Emancipation.\n And the Salem witch hunt of 1692 remains a major blot on the Human\n\nRights record of America, a country to which millions have fled to find\n\nrelief from religio-political persecution. \n\n  It is ironic that the Latin American church has given rise to\n\nLiberation Theology which seeks to fuse ecclesiastical power and state power\n\nto socialism - a losing combination if ever there was one.\n\n\n  The Protestant Reformation lighted candles in a dark, static\n\nEurope, dominated for a thousand years by the Church which assigned itself\n\nthe task to be the unquestioned conscience of all men who deviated from dogma\n\non pain of death.\n The Lion Handbook, \'The History of Christianity\', claims that lasting\n\nsocial, political and economic changes followed the Reformation and to some\n\nextent shaped it. \n\n  But the great religious wars of Europe followed, as the various\n\nfactions of a splintered church sought to dominate each other and to forcibly\n\ncontrol men, - body, mind and spirit - via the sword of the state.\n The great German reformer Martin Luther himself, stood against the\n\nrevolt of the peasants against harsh political and economic conditions heaped\n\nupon them by monarchical rulers. \n\n \n\n\nLuther declared,  " inasmuch as they are all evil-minded and brazenly\n\nrefuse to obey, and furthermore resist their masters."  \n\n \n\n  " They have forfeited life and\n\nsoul as do all faithless perjured, mendacious, disobedient knaves and\n\nvillains. Therefore it becomes the duty of all here to strangle and stab\n\nsecretly or publicly, all such, and remember that there is nothing so\n\npoisonous, injurious and fiendish as a rebellious person, just as you would\n\nkill a mad dog: if you do not strike him he will strike you, and with you,\n\nthe whole country." The princes took the advice of their\n\nspiritual mentor. \n\n  " model\n\nchristian society"  by the same combination of preaching and force.\n For more than 100 years no musical instrument was allowed in\n\nCalvinist Geneva! \n\n  Modern liberal democratic societies confer political power upon\n\necclesiastical authorities at their own risk.\n The track record of the church, with the sword of the state in its\n\nhand, is not a good one.\n The distant historical examples cited can be more than matched by\n\nrecent contemporary ones. \n\n  Historians tend to shy away from the known alliance of elements\n\nof Christianity with Nazism and Fascism before and during the Second World\n\nWar, a theme which novelist and former Jesuit professor and close associate\n\nof Pope John XXMalachi Martin, explores in \'Vatican\'.\n We are, however, in no doubt about the role of the Dutch Reformed\n\nChurch in supplying the theological and moral underpinnings for Apartheid up\n\nuntil very recent times.\n And we should carefully watch the roles of resurgent ecclesiastical\n\npowers in re-shaping post-Cold War Eastern Europe ( something which the News\n\neither don\'t know how to, or won\'t report). \n\n  In light of the near exhaustion of secular humanism, the\n\nexcesses of liberal democracy and the anarchising of freedom, the search is\n\non for a moral North Star to guide societies which are morally adrift.\n The separation of Church and State, which has given Western\n\nSocieties the greatest freedom and material prosperity ever known among\n\nordinary men ( even in Jamaica), is therefore up for review.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  THE latest round of extensive cricket coverage by Jamaica\n\nBroadcasting Corporation television has illustrated, once again, that Jamaica\n\nMUST have at least one other television channel.\n Those people who do not care about, or are bored by the game of\n\ncricket - and this, surely, includes most women and a fair portion of men -\n\nwere disgusted by the blocks of hours and hours of prime T.V. time which our\n\nONLY channel recently diverted to covering the matches in Australia. \n\n  J.B.C. allowed cricket to push aside all other programmes,\n\nexcept a number of those \'soaps\' which promote the frivolous foreign values\n\nthat J.B.C. apparently considers essential to Jamaican life!\n As a young clerk in a shop I entered the other day remarked to the\n\nworld at large:  " I\'m tired to death of cricket, cricket and nothing\n\nbut cricket.\n\n Of course, one might wonder when she had last seen that on J.B.C.,\n\nanyway!\n Jamaica is still being forced to make do with one television channel\n\nwhose programming, in both the selection and the quality of its reproduction,\n\nis poor and shoddy. \n\n  As an example of the latter, at least one of the video-players\n\nthe station uses jiggles the images of advertisements and programmes to the\n\npoint where colours blur together, and any print on screen is indecipherable,\n\nwhile sound quality is completely distorted by static.\n be, the advertisers don\'t mind.\n Certainly, many of them don\'t care enough to bother to have mounted\n\nnew advertisements in the last ten years.\n Though this, possibly, creates a world record in the age of\n\nT.V.-ads., it surely produces very few sales for the product concerned. \n\n  But, it seems, no-one is really bothered, anyway, as the present \'normal\'\n\nprogramming ( sans cricket) now caters to the lowest common denominator of\n\npublic taste.\n The Jamaican people, however they feel about the matter, must put up\n\nwith the distasteful videos and certain recent nasty advertisements which\n\nconstantly invade the privacy of our homes.\n Some time ago, when complained about, the growing practice of using\n\nunmusical pop-videos as fillers was discontinued by J.B.C., but it is back\n\nagain!\n As these are sneaked on and pushed into odd corners right before and\n\nafter mis-timed programmes which one actually might want to view, there is\n\nlittle choice in the matter of whether or not one views such videos! \n\n \n\n  It is an indictment of us as a nation that we put up with a\n\ngovernment policy which allows us only one, government-controlled T.V.\n\nchannel, while  population, which is only a tenth of\n\nJamaica\'s population, enjoys the programmes of one local station - similar to\n\nJ.B.C. - and several others which are channelled in by satellite, re-\n\ntransmitted locally in scrambled form, and de-scrambled by boxes offered to\n\nthe general populace at reasonable rent.\n Our television policy simply has the usual philosophy:\n\n\n  We have gone from one decade to the next, from one election to\n\nthe next, with nothing but promises of another T.V. station.\n Isn\'t it extraordinary that the one additional television licence\n\nthat was eventually granted, was given to a company which has proved unable\n\nto find the money to put its station on the air?\n This, even though we all know that there are a number of local\n\npersons with sufficient funds - and with the interest and access to expertise\n\n- to run a second station.\n However, while the deteriorating values of the television,\n\nconstantly glorifying violence, are not regarded by either of our political\n\nparties to be anything more than a \'froth-and-bubble\' matter, even with the\n\nspin-off of our rising crime rate, our one station always becomes a key\n\ninstitution at election time.\n This is curious in view of the fact that the use to which it has so\n\nfar been put, the putting out of political ads and jingles, has been proved\n\nto be completely ineffective. \n\n \n\n  For some decades now, Jamaica has witnessed an escalation in\n\nviolence at election time.\n This is generally admitted to have been encouraged by relying\n\nheavily on public meetings and harangues.\n Such confrontations of verbal violence cause bloody, physical\n\nclashes between the party faithful, which both parties profess to abhor,\n\nwhile trucking and bus-ing in numbers of their followers!\n Clearly, much of the physical violence, the political murders, can\n\nbe stopped by removing the emphasis on such public meetings; by scheduling,\n\nin their place, a series of political debates on television, together with\n\ninterviews conducted by quick-witted, knowledgeable, unbiased and outspoken\n\nmedia personalities.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'd3c20471-7e21-4cd6-8041-94cddc7ede86', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.483607+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9682989716529846, 'non_english_score': 0.03170102834701538}
{'text': 'ELECTION rumours are in the air; odds in favour of one party or\n\nthe other are being calculated.\n The Stone polls and the Stone writings are favouring Prime Minister\n\nPatterson and the P.N.P.\n But it is never over till it is over and the best and most accurate\n\npolls ( such as Professor Stone\'s) can only give the picture when it is\n\ntaken.\n come of elections\n\nbut only if all things remain equal ( the  \'ceteris paribus\'\n\n principle).\n In other words sudden and or dramatic events or circumstances can\n\nshift the picture overnight and alter what seemed to be an inevitable result.\n When this happens, it does not mean that the poll was necessarily\n\nfaulty.\n\n\n  But it does seem that in Jamaican politics we now have a new\n\nseason.\n An atmosphere of civility between the two leaders Mr. Patterson and\n\nMr. Seaga clearly exists.\n Gone are the rancorous exchanges which inflamed the passions of blind\n\nfollowers of both parties.\n The situation is far from perfect, of course, and narrow-minded\n\npartisans continue to behave in ways that beg the question of their judgement\n\nand of their intelligence.\n I do not refer to the unlettered and uneducated.\n Recent events surrounding the retirement of the principal of a\n\ncertain high school in the East, bears out the observation. \n\n  Mr. Patterson and Mr. Seaga, however, have together set a new\n\ntone for relationships between contending political parties on the Jamaican\n\nscene.\n There have been hiccups in the process yes - but both men have kept\n\nthe lid on in a manner that a great many of their followers could well\n\nimitate.\n In that regard, the media as a whole has been less than fair to Mr.\n\nSeaga as the Hon. Hector Wynter is never tired of pointing out. \n\n \n\n  The fact is that Mr. Seaga as Leader of the Opposition has\n\nbehaved with commendable restraint.\n Heaven knows, given the shaky and fragile nature of the economy and\n\nthe fall-out in high prices through the devastating cost of living, an\n\nirresponsible Opposition would have much to exploit. \n\n  It cannot be an accident that Mr. Seaga has resisted the\n\ntemptation to make capital out of a readily exploitable situation for the\n\nbenefit of the Opposition.\n What I see and believe is that the Opposition Leader has taken a\n\ndeliberate position to criticize constructively, to warn rather than to\n\ncondemn, to poke rather than to destroy, to press rather than to crush.\n There are some media personalities who behave a great deal less\n\nresponsibly than Mr. Seaga in opposing the government.\n\n\n  There will be P.N.P. die-hards who will rush to judgement against\n\nme for trying to set the record straight re Mr. Seaga, no less than J.L.P.\n\npartisans who have called me  " Comrade"  and  " no\n\nlonger objective"  because I wrote a couple of pieces favourable to\n\nMr. Patterson.\n I make no apology to either side of narrow partisan followers.\n The truth is, I would rather take my chances with either Mr.\n\nPatterson or Mr. Seaga in the matter of judging my attempts at impartial\n\ncommentary, than with most of their followers at high or low levels.\n Both of them have demonstrated far more tolerance towards those who\n\ndo not share their politics and shown acceptance of those who don\'t fawn at\n\ntheir feet in unthinking worship. \n\n  But they both have Achilles heels which leave me puzzled.\n In the case of Mr. Seaga, his handling of dissent within his own\n\nparty stands in baffling contrast to his stance in relation to his detractors\n\nin the opposing party.\n He has certainly failed an opportunity or two to show that he can be\n\nmagnanimous even to those he might have felt ( rightly or wrongly) were\n\nbetraying him. \n\n \n\n  His honesty in admitting on the Breakfast Club ( as reported)\n\nthat he was still not speaking to the reduced if mythical \'Gang of Four\'\n\nbelittled him more than any P.N.P. slander ever could.\n Those who look to him for a show of generosity of bigness and of\n\nstatesmanship are clearly very disappointed.\n His detractors understandably exploit this as evidence of unfitness\n\nfor national leadership despite an abundance of talent.\n\n\n  In the case of Mr. Patterson, he has been presiding over a party\n\nwhich is perceived by many as having a reputation for nepotism.\n A high ranking member of his party has said of equally high-ranking\n\nparty members that  " the rush for spoils is obscene"  .\n Another high ranking supporter has said of the P.N.P. in this\n\nconnection that the party sometimes appears to have a death wish.\n Certainly Mr. Seaga and the J.L.P. are said to have a better record\n\nof appointing known P.N.P. supporters and sympathisers to significant\n\npositions.\n One hears people recalling that Mr. Seaga as Prime Minister publicly\n\ndisciplined a minister and an M.P. of his party when they did not toe the\n\nline in political tolerance.\n They are saying on the street that even known P.N.P. supporters are\n\nsometimes excluded from merited appointments because they  " do not\n\nhave an active political profile"  . \n\n \n\n  If Mr. Seaga and Mr. Patterson could rise above these two major\n\nflaws in their personal in-party partisanship, Jamaican politics would just\n\nabout achieve the near ideal.\n They would then both set a moral and ethical tone that could set a\n\nproud face on Jamaican political democracy.\n In their respective failings, they have both shown that they are more\n\nthe victims of their extra-zealous followers than the captives of their own\n\nprogressive inclinations. \n\n  It is certainly not beyond the capacity and the will of either\n\nparty leader to attend to and to shed the albatrosses which plague their\n\npersonal reputations and tarnish the image of their parties.\n They do owe that much to themselves, to their followers, to the\n\ncredibility of their respective parties and above all to this nation in the\n\nstruggle.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  THE House of Representatives muffed an opportunity this week,\n\nwhen it debated and passed the Copyright Bill.\n It was the appropriate place and time to profile the entertainment\n\nand artistic community.\n As it turned out only Opposition Leader Edward Seaga went anywhere\n\nnear doing so. \n\n  The existing Copyright Act goes back to 1911.\n A new Bill passed by the Parliament in 1977 was never enacted, and as\n\nPrime Minister P.J. Patterson said on Tuesday its provisions were outdated\n\neven before the Bill was passed. \n\n  In all this time successive governments have done considerable\n\nresearch on copyright laws in various parts of the world.\n Mr. Seaga said on Wednesday that he had sent Tom Tavares-Finson to\n\nspend three months in the United States looking at how the copyright system\n\nworks. \n\n  So a lot of work has gone into the legal side, and the Bill\n\nsuggests as much with its 153 clauses, and its accompanying Ministry Paper\n\nNo. 5 with 100 foolscap pages of clause by clause explanation.\n\n\n  In his presentation the Prime Minister gave us background on how\n\nthe Bill finally reached the House, and he addressed some of the provisions.\n Parliamentary Secretary in the Ministry of Finance A.J. Nicholson\n\ndealt with the cultural aspects, as also did the Opposition\'s Mike Henry.\n\n\n\n  Attorney General Carl Rattray gave the legal history.\n It was left to Mr. Seaga to trace the development of the local music\n\nindustry from the 1950s up, marking the milestones as he went along, and\n\nnaming the people who had contributed to that development. \n\n \n\n  His appreciation of the creative power of the people in the\n\nindustry from Wilfred Edwards through Desmond Decker and Don Drummond to\n\nJimmy Cliff and Shabba Ranks, his comment about some not making the\n\ntransition will stand us in good stead. \n\n  One would have expected Mr. Henry with his interest in publishing\n\nto have done similarly with the local writing and publishing industry.\n One would have expected Mr. Nicholson coming from the Ministry of\n\nEducation and Culture to take the opportunity to place on the record an\n\nappreciation of where our artists, potters, sculptors, play  - <?/>\n\nwrights, dancers, choreographers et al are coming from. They muffed it. \n\n  Prime Minister Patterson, Mr. Henry, and Mr. Seaga all alluded to\n\nthe income to be generated from intellectual property rights.\n The Bill is significant legislation touching the lives of thousands\n\nof Jamaicans, yet we have no estimate of how many singers, players of\n\ninstruments, producers, theatre folk, painters and sculptors there are. \n\n  We are not told how much foreign exchange the entertainment and\n\nartistic industry brings into this country over the past several years.\n We are not told how many are employed directly and indirectly.\n We are not told what their contribution to the Gross Domestic Product\n\nhas been and how this piece of legislation, properly used will increase that\n\ncontribution. \n\n  Mr. Seaga calls for an Institute of Popular Jamaican Music, and\n\nthe Government would do well to heed that call.\n But one would have expected to hear from some contributor to the\n\ndebate what effect the Jamaica School of Music has had on local popular\n\nmusic.\n\n\n  Is the Cultural Training Centre having any influence at all on\n\nthe writing of lyrics, the arranging and composing of music, the dancing of\n\nghetto groups?\n\n\n \n\n  We are all familiar with the rumours about who are the people\n\nearning big incomes.\n If you were to believe the rumours then Bob Marley should have been a\n\nbillionaire, Jimmy Cliff in the same financial stratosphere and Shabba Ranks\n\ngetting there fast. \n\n  Fact is their earnings are reasonably good, and astronomical when\n\ncompared to the less talented or the less fortunate.\n So?\n Who cares for these people, who in the main, cannot afford\n\ninvestments, insurance nor NIS?\n\n\n  Of course it may be argued that there are no statistics on which\n\na proper profile of our entertainers and artists could have been developed.\n But that should not be accepted.\n Carl Stone runs a sample of the population and is able to provide the\n\ncountry with accurate readings whether it be for elections or for businesses.\n\n\n  There is the Performing Rights Society which should have some\n\nfigures somewhere.\n And, there are a host of people in this country who know what goes\n\non, the people involved who could provide a body of information to give a\n\nfairly accurate profile. \n\n \n\n  People like Dermot Hussey, Tony Laing, Bunny Goodison, the Blake\n\nBrothers of Merritone fame and a host of others have been close to the\n\nmusical industry and have information.\n They have their counterparts in the world of dance, theatre, painting\n\nand sculpting. \n\n  If the Culture part of the Ministry of Education wants to do some\n\ngood it should recognise that it bombed on this one, and call in people who\n\nare capable researchers and commission them to get the data. \n\n  Meanwhile it would be well if the legislators begin to look at\n\nwhat is before them and make meaningful contributions.\n For the Copyright Bill to have contributions from only five people is\n\nnot good enough.\n The Senate, as it has done in the past, should show the House how\n\nthese matters are dealt with. \n\n  But then again, maybe that is all it deserves, after all those it\n\naffects most did not even bother to have a representative group in Parliament\n\nto listen to the debate.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  ENVIRONMENTALISTS are sure to disagree with the closing comments\n\nof Miss Dawn Ritch\'s article \'Dining Out\', ( <tf> Sunday Gleaner </tf> ,\n\nJanuary 24, 1993).

{'text': 'SIR Alister McIntyre, Vice Chancellor ( which is to say, working\n\nhead) of the University of the West Indies sent a strong new signal recently\n\non the future relationship of the University with the wider society.\n He let it be known that the intellectual, technical and technological\n\nresources of the institution would become more available to industry,\n\norganizations, and development entities.\n They will pay, of course, but the revenue will in turn assist the\n\ndevelopment and expansion of the university itself.\n To a public often cynical about the extent of the University\'s\n\ncommitment to development as opposed to degree- manufacturing, the\n\npronouncement could hardly be more timely. \n\n  " The University boasts the largest pool of specialized\n\nand expert personnel as well as the greatest stock of research equipment and\n\nother facilities within the Caribbean"  .\n So states a current report on the University\'s plans for the next\n\ndecade, in a very readable booklet titled \'The University of the West Indies\n\n- Into the 21st Century\'.\n " in order to survive and succeed the\n\nCaribbean region must begin to build a pool of human resources in the areas\n\nof science, technology, management and organization"  the report\n\nspells out a role and response for the University in these words: \n\n \n\n \n " This development of human resources is the task that the University\n\nwill respond to in this decade...\n Given the far reaching extent of our territorial responsibilities (\n\nin) Jamaica, Trinidad, Barbados and eleven non-campus countries, the\n\nUniversity of the West is  most suited  ( my emphasis) to\n\nrespond creatively and purposefully to the challenges of human resource\n\ndevelopment in the Caribbean"  .\n I can almost see the cynics relenting and the doubters cautiously\n\napplauding.\n But if reservations remain, based on past experience of what the\n\nreport terms as the University being  " acutely conscious of the need\n\nto improve the efficiency of its own operations"  , the following\n\ncommitment must be more reassuring. \n\n \n " There must be a continuing effort to enhance the relevance, quality\n\nand usefulness of academic programmes. Information is the sustenance of a\n\ngrowing society.\n Along this vein, the University sees it necessary not only to\n\nencourage and facilitate more research in all aspects of the Caribbean but\n\nalso to assist in the dissemination of this information in a manner that is\n\n practical  and  useful  , ( my emphasis).\n We plan to serve more effectively as a conduit for information and\n\nknowledge both regionally and internationally"  .\n\n  The preceding quotes underscore Vice Chancellor McIntyre\'s recent\n\nannouncement.\n The new commitment addresses a beef that a great many in the public\n\nhave about the too- traditional Ivory Tower-like role of U.W.I. in a\n\ndeveloping context.\n In contrast, the flexibility of response North American universities\n\nwith their Extension and Continuing Studies departments catering to a wide\n\nclientele of motivated persons, is often cited against U.W.I. by frustrated\n\nwould-be students and by interested observers.\n Similarly innovations by British universities such as \'University of\n\nthe Air\' or \'Open University\' allowing working persons who cannot enter the\n\nuniversity walls to acquire academic qualifications or enhance scholarly\n\nknowledge, are cited against a U.W.I. seen as too smugly trotting out degrees\n\nin an uncreative, unimaginative fashion. \n\n  It is refreshing that the report quoted here speaks so honestly\n\nand candidly to the University\'s acknowledgement of its own inefficiencies\n\nand shortcomings.\n What is of equal concern is the failure of the society to demand more\n\nclearly and unequivocally the kind of university it wants.\n " is too important to be\n\nleft to the generals." \n Why is higher education not seen as too important to be left to the\n\nintellectuals and academics? \n\n \n\n  If as the report states, the University boasts the largest pool\n\nof specialized and export personnel as well as the greatest stock of research\n\nequipment etc., in the Caribbean, why has the public not demanded fuller use\n\nand integration of these resources with the needs and aspiration of the\n\nsociety?\n Why hasn\'t there been pressure up to now to imitate the flexibility\n\nof response and the innovations of North American and British universities\n\nwhere their served societies needs are not nearly as great as those of our\n\ndeveloping society? \n\n  When I last wrote on this topic, two persons corresponded with\n\nvery useful and practical suggestions for the University to become more\n\ninclusive in its programmes and one leading service club invited me to\n\naddress them on the matter.\n I was disappointed.\n People ought to be speaking out; the public should be flooding the\n\nU.W.I. with suggestions and demands ( yes demands) for appropriate responses\n\nto their higher education needs.\n It is clear that Vice Chancellor McIntyre and the current U.W.I\n\nleadership have set a climate for accepting such suggestions as are feasible\n\nand workable, given their own pro- active moves and statements in the Report\n\ncited. \n\n  It is not enough that only a Rex Nettleford, Carl Stone or a Geof\n\nBrown consistently appear in print or an Aggrey Brown on the air  - \n\nwaves to join university academics to other resources informing or attempting\n\nto help educate the society.\n It is signal and remarkable but not enough that an Extra-Mural\n\nStudies ( now School of Continuing Studies) caters to thousands of\n\nnon-degree-seeking studies but is not yet permitted to prepare working adults\n\nfor degrees.\n It is useful and helpful but not enough that hundreds of\n\nconsultancies by university academics are quietly unseen like a  "\n\nlight under a bushel"  . \n\n \n\nis a partnership between a demanding public and a University which now states\n\n( in the Report) that it is ready to meet the challenges of this decade\n\n " in order to propel the Caribbean into the 21st Century." \n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  ( Part V of a series)  \n\n  NUMEROUS proposals have been made from time to time for\n\nmodification of the Constitution so as to effect improvements without\n\nchanging its basic structure.\n Some of these proposals are far-reaching in nature.\n Many are aimed at making effective the checks on executive power,\n\nimproving the efficiency of Parliament, and increasing the accountability of\n\nParliamentarians.\n In the Report of the Stone Committee which examined in detail the\n\nperformance, accountability and responsibilities of elected Parliamentarians\n\nand made comprehensive recommendations, only three of its recommendations\n\nentailed constitutional amendment for their implementation.\n These are changing to the presidential system, which we discussed in\n\nPart III of this series; giving voters at the constituency level the power to\n\nrecall Members of Parliament who violate a prescribed code of conduct and/or\n\nfail to perform their specified duties which we will examine in this article;\n\nand requiring that Members of Parliament reside in or have a residence in the\n\nconstituencies they represent. \n\n  Recall of Parliamentarians  \n\n  The proposal to give electors the right to recall Members of\n\nParliament is theoretically attractive, but has serious practical and legal\n\nproblems.\n The majority of the Stone Committee supported it on the grounds that\n\n " giving voters the right to recall Members of Parliament would have\n\na major impact in restoring to the public a sense that they as voters have\n\ncontrol over the politician.\n To give voters the right to recall non- performing Members of\n\nParliament would send a serious signal to politicians motivating them to take\n\ntheir duties and responsibilities more seriously"  . \n\n  The system of recall was first put forward by persons who\n\nsupported the Communist system.\n In the programme adopted by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union\n\nin 1919, the theory of delegation is emphasized and provision is made for the\n\npeople to recall their delegates  " in the most easy and accessible\n\nmanner"  .\n However, the experience of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\n\nwas that the devise was mainly used as an instrument for the purging of\n\ndeputies who lost favour with the party leadership.\n In France, this system was proposed by the Communist Party in the\n\ndiscussion on a Constitution for the Fourth Republic but was rejected by all\n\nother parties. \n\n  When there are more than one Party in a country the existence of\n\nthis system is likely to cause constant electioneering, political instability\n\nand possible chaos.\n The main reasons for strong dissatisfaction with the performance of\n\nMembers of Parliament is not their inaccessibility or lack of effort but the\n\nlow level of public and social services in the constituency.\n In many cases, this is aggravated by general public dissatisfaction\n\nwith the benefits being derived from the public sector or the general state\n\nof the economy.\n It will therefore be difficult to divorce a particular Member of\n\nParliament from the state of the national economy and the performance of the\n\nGovernment as a whole, or unfair to single him out for condemnation because\n\nof Cabinet or ministerial attention by government.\n It will still be even less justifiable to apply the same standard in\n\nthe case of an Opposition Member of Parliament. \n\n  The Minority Report gave the following cogent grounds why such a\n\nsystem would cause insuperable difficulties: \n\n \n " ( 1) The use of recall petitions by party activists and local\n\ngovernment representatives seeking to replace the sitting MP; \n\n  ( 2) The use of the recall petitions to pursue factional disputes\n\namong competing leaders in the constituency; \n\n  ( 3) Cumbersome and costly procedures governing the verification\n\nof signatures on the petitions; \n\n  ( 4) The danger of an increase in by-elections and additional\n\ncosts in electoral administration occasioned by successful recall petitions\n\nespecially during the second term of governing parties when many MP\'s begin\n\nto shrink their duties; \n\n  ( 5) The use of recall petitions by opposition candidates bent on\n\nunseating incumbent MP\'s"  . \n\n  The Majority felt that adequate safeguards and procedures could\n\nbe established to avoid frivolous and irresponsible recall petitions.\n\n\n \n " ( 1) Requiring that recall petitions should be signed by 51 per\n\ncent of registered voters in the constituency and that the recall petitions\n\nbe verified by the Returning Officer attached to the Electoral Office; \n\n  ( 2) That after a recall a petition has been verified the MP\n\nwould have a right to appeal to the Constituency Council made up of leaders\n\nfrom civic and community organisations. \n\n  The Revocation of an MP\'s election would only stand if the\n\nConstituency Council agree that the petition is justified; \n\n  ( 3) That recall petitions would only be valid in cases where\n\nMP\'s are accused of violating the MP code of conduct, are accused of failing\n\nto perform the specified duties and responsibilities of MP\'s or are convicted\n\nin the courts for crimes that bring the office of MP into disrepute.\n The Constituency Council should have the power to determine if the\n\nrecall petition meets these criteria"  . \n\n  These suggestions are on their face quite impracticable.\n Bearing in mind our experience in the registration of voters system\n\nit would be impossible for the Returning Officer to verify within a\n\nreasonable time the identity and genuineness of the signatures of 51 per cent\n\nof the registered voters which in all constituencies run into many thousands.\n It would also be very difficult to establish a precise code of\n\nconduct or measure of unsatisfactory performance.\n If the rules of natural justice are maintained it would not be\n\npossible to deny the Member of Parliament the right to challenge the Petition\n\nin the Courts.\n If the system is put into operation at all it could condemn the\n\ncountry to exist on a diet of by- elections, constant political in-fighting\n\nand bickering, and bitter and violent rivalry on a continuous basis.\n It is surprising that this proposal should be put forward at the same\n\ntime as an attempt is being made to increase the independence of the back \n\n-  benchers in Parliament, since this system could make Members of\n\nParliament hostages of the Party machinery and political agitators. \n\n  Reduction of the Parliamentary Term  \n\n  It has been suggested that the life of each Parliament should be\n\nreduced to a fixed term of say, four years.\n In practice, under the Parliamentary Cabinet System, Governments\n\noften go to the polls before the expiration of their usual allotment of five\n\nyears and this has been the experience in Jamaica.\n In many cases, the Political Executive loses touch with the people\n\nafter a period of time.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'b62c4564-e6e9-41a2-b0f9-f3bc369917a2', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.486275+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9640867710113525, 'non_english_score': 0.03591322898864746}
{'text': 'The power of the Pen?  \n\n By Geof Brown \n\n  DID Dawn Ritch single-handedly torpedo the booming Stock Market?\n In news coverage following the great dive, it was pointedly suggested\n\nthat Dawn\'s article  " Getting Out of the Stock Market"  (\n\n Sunday Gleaner  Feby 7) was the villain of the play. \n\n  One commentator even suggested that in some jurisdictions the\n\nwriter would find herself behind bars.\n Ironically, a piece of proposed legislation on Securities had\n\nenvisaged just the kind of scenario in which a journalist ( generic term)\n\ncould manipulate the Market with significant effect.\n All of us in the media fraternity strongly opposed that potential\n\ntrespass on press freedom. \n\n  I am by no means certain that Dawn\'s article precipitated the\n\ngreat dive.\n It could have been the trigger.\n On the other hand, it could well have been a fortuitous coincidence\n\noccurring alongside other factors, some of which had already begun to show\n\nand had occasioned warnings of a likely crash from expert analysts.\n Statisticians warn us against what they call spurious correlations.\n In a famous example, some major event in Great Britain ( Was it the\n\nPotato Famine?) always occurred in conjunction with a similar critical event\n\nin Argentina. \n\n  The two were not connected in any casual way but for the unwary,\n\nthey could easily be seen as ( spuriously) associated. \n\n  relationship\n\n  between Ms. Ritch\'s article and the sudden dive in the Stock\n\nMarket, we are reminded of that old dictum  " The Pen is Mightier than\n\nthe Sword"  .\n In modern day translations, the Press is stronger than the Law\n\nMakers, the popular writer is more influential than the elected politicians,\n\nthe credible commentator has more sway than the experts in their fields. \n\n \n\n  Clearly that is why Dawn Ritch is being given credit, justly or\n\nunjustly, in the stock market dilemma.\n The proponents of the recent proposed legislation to curb\n\njournalistic comment on Financial Securities, must now be chuckling - \n\n\n  Time and again we hear a leading commentator in the electronic\n\nmedia declare with mock innocence that he has no great influence in response\n\nto  suggestions to the contrary.\n Never mind that in a public survey the commentator was respectably\n\nnoted as one of the Jamaicans who had greatest impact in 1992.\n The Dawn Ritch credit should now convince all popular commentators to\n\nmind how they wield their undoubted power.\n This column has been drawing attention to the relatively unchecked\n\npower of media personalities whose constituencies neither hire or fire them.\n\n\n  Non-democratic regimes with heavily centralized state authority\n\nhave always understood the superseding power of media and popular writers.\n What comes through as persecution and repression of writers and the\n\npress is as much a necessary survival tactic of autocratic regimes as it is\n\nanything else.\n Even in democracies, ours no less than others, occasional desperate\n\nand media-frustrated legislators try curbs of the press through threats\n\nbribes and rewards - sometimes subtle sometimes blatant.\n\n\n  There is a flip-side to the power of the pen of course.\n Where popular writers and commentators cannot easily be defeated or\n\ncurbed by state power, they can fall of their own weight.\n Abuse of public trust is a sure route to the break-down of\n\ncredibility.\n When the fawning public turns against its heroes and heroines (\n\nwriters or politicians) the very eminence of the idols is proportionate to\n\nthe size of their fall. \n\n  So let writers and media commentators beware.\n They cannot have their cake and eat it too.\n Their power demands an equal obligation of responsibility and\n\naccountability.\n This column has pointed out before that where most other professional\n\ngroups have institutionalized checks against abuse, short of proven libel,\n\nthe press can and often does get away with mayhem from inaccurate, if not\n\nsometimes mischievous material served up for public consumption. \n\n  The Stock Market fiasco is a sobering reminder of the need for\n\njournalistic responsibility - whether or not Ms. Ritch was the villain of the\n\nplay.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  THERE is an advertisement on television extolling the merits of\n\nMidas, the facility whereby you can access money through National Commercial\n\nBank ( NCB) 24 hours a day, seven days a week. \n\n  Wittingly, or unwittingly the ad speaks to problems in the\n\nman-woman relationship in this country.\n It starts out on a campus setting.\n The young man is poring over a book.\n His girlfriend passes by and slips him a note which suggests that\n\nthey go to the movies later. \n\n  The scene shifts to outside the movie house.\n The young man is waiting.\n Shortly his girlfriend arrives and she has in tow two of her\n\ngirlfriends.\n The young man is taken aback.\n He takes her aside and shows her his wallet.\n He has a lonely\n\n$100 bill. \n\n  Clearly that lonesome Concorde is not going to pay for four of\n\nthem and buy refreshments.\n Not to worry the young lady goes for her Midas card, approaches the\n\nbank, nearby and withdraws the necessary cash.\n She returns and slips the young man the money and all four are on\n\ntheir way into the movies. \n\n  Now not many people will find anything wrong with the ad, but if\n\nyou think about it there is a lot wrong with it.\n To begin with the girlfriend takes a lot for granted when she brings\n\nalong her two friends.\n Implicit in that is that the young man is going to finance their\n\nentrance to the movies. \n\n \n\n  There is embarrassment.\n He was not prepared for what happened.\n His money would not stretch that far.\n In real life the incident could have caused a severing of relations\n\nthere and then.\n Men have been known to drop women who bring a crowd with them on such\n\ndates.\n\n\n  But, the girlfriend is not put out and is prepared to access her\n\nown money to solve the problem.\n Why then should she surreptitiously slip him the money?\n Why not pay the fares herself?\n Would the young man be embarrassed if she did?\n The fact that he accepts it, is a clear indication that he would be\n\nembarrassed.\n\n\n  Yet his behaviour is similar to that of many Jamaican men.\n They are put off when a woman is prepared to pay for lunch, although\n\nshe is the beneficiary of better pay than he is, and likely also has an\n\nexpense account from her company.\n Many men feel uncomfortable in such situations.\n They are quite prepared to have the woman slip money to them under\n\nthe table, out of sight of prying eyes.\n And the odd thing is that women are prepared to go along with this\n\nhypocrisy. \n\n  In discussing the ad with some people they tried to make the\n\npoint that the girlfriend in the ad made her guy look good.\n I doubt it, certainly the two friends must have figured out what was\n\nhappening, although they pretended that they were not hip to it. \n\n  They are going to form their opinion that the girlfriend was\n\nboasting about her boyfriend when in fact he did not have two cents to rub\n\ntogether, and she was  " minding him"  . \n\n  In a genuine relationship the girlfriend would have alerted the\n\nyoung man to the fact that she was taking along her friends.\n She would have determined whether he could finance the whole package\n\nor needed help.\n\n\n \n\n  So she proceeded to slip him money to cover his embarrassment.\n Both were wrong, she in doing and he in accepting.\n He should have been man enough to tell her to pay the fares.\n " Cho a nuh nuttin\'\n\ndat, still."   \n\n  The point is being made because a lot of men are uncomfortable in\n\ndealing with today\'s women who find themselves financially independent and\n\nare willing and able to invite a man out to lunch or dinner, and pay their\n\nway.\n over attitude which suggests that the man\n\nshould always be seen to be paying.\n\n\n  It is time we come clean.\n There have been men in this country, for instance truck operators who\n\ndrive their trucks all over the country.\n When they collect their money they take it home and present it to\n\ntheir wives.\n It is she who spends the money from buying food and clothes and\n\npaying the mortgage to seeing that the truck is in good repair with tyres,\n\nlicence and so on. \n\n  When the man comes home on an evening, he has a bath, eats and\n\nputs on his \'rum shirt\' and his wife will give him a sum of money and he is\n\non his way, perhaps even missing for two days.\n She is not perturbed, because she knows he is deserving of the break,\n\nand in any case it is she who runs things. \n\n  Here there is no hypocrisy, no debate, no argument about the role\n\nof the man and the woman.\n other\'s\n\n contribution. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  IT has been announced that the Government intends ( at last!) to\n\nput some teeth into the law controlling night noises.\n Instead of the present ridiculous forty dollars for contravening the\n\nlaw, the offence will soon attract a penalty of\n\n$10,000 or three months for a first offence and\n\n$15,000 or six months for a second conviction for this offence. \n\n  Action on this matter is long overdue.\n It is scandalous that over the years, private persons should have\n\nbeen permitted to terrorise whole communities night after night with a\n\nbombardment of sound, powerful enough to shake well-built dwellings. \n\n  The majority of Jamaicans are poor and hard working.\n Many are old and ill.\n We have a large school population, and every day new babies are\n\nborn.\n If there is one thing that all categories need, it is their sleep.\n Surely, it is intolerable that they should be robbed of this\n\nfundamental personal right which is essential for good health and efficient\n\nfunctioning in their daily work; and to what purpose?\n To satisfy the wholly selfish whims of others who get their pleasure\n\n( strange to say) or money from terrorising a captive audience in their\n\nhomes! \n\n  But even if people did not wish to sleep, and even if they were\n\ntoo poor to buy an evening meal, they should be able to enjoy the peace and\n\nrest of their homes however humble.\n Yet for thousands of Jamaicans, quietness in their homes is a luxury\n\nthey enjoy only when there is a power outage. \n\n  Can we really be surprised that there are so many irritable and\n\nshort- tempered people on our streets and at our places of work?\n And has anybody done research into the effect of lack of sleep on\n\nthe level of road accidents in Jamaica?\n We have one of the highest accident rates in the world.\n Some are due to drivers whose reflexes and judgement are impaired by\n\nalcohol or other drugs.\n Inadequate sleep should be added to the list of causes of road\n\naccidents in Jamaica. \n\n  But there is another side to the activities of these sound\n\nsystems beyond just the noise nuisance.\n There is the question of the content of the music that they are\n\nforcing into the private homes of people.\n From my home I have from time to time had to listen to some of the\n\nmost degrading filth, the coarsest trash.\n There is little uplifting in the so- called lyrics being drummed\n\ninto the ears of the people of this country by these operators of systems.\n\n\n\n \n\n  A citizen has the right to select the music he prefers to listen\n\nto for relaxation; and he has the right to choose the time when he listens.\n In general when one comes home at the end of a tiring day, what the\n\nbody and mind require is something quiet and soothing.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '0c006c7a-89ec-4015-825c-64e277375207', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.487687+00:00',

{'text': 'I\'M very pleased with myself.\n I sold the majority of my shares last week, shares that I bought\n\nseveral years ago when I thought investing in publicly-held companies was a\n\ngood thing to do. \n\n  My mother used to bet on the horses religiously, my father bought\n\nstocks... his was the bigger gamble.\n As one stock broker said to me last week punters at least check the\n\nform of horse before they bet, but investors in the stock market aren\'t in\n\nthe slightest bit interested in the performance of the companies.\n They just march into the stock brokers with their money and say\n\n " Invest it!" \n Every company is a winner, and the value of their shares keeps rising.\n\n\n\n  The same thing happened in Tokyo several years ago.\n Nobody thought the Stock Exchange there could crash.\n Japan had the biggest trade surplus in the world, land values were\n\n   escalating   , and production was rising.\n But it too fell victim to the crash in 1987, and today values on the\n\nstock market there are about half what they were. \n\n  The United Kingdom also had an asset explosion.\n Everybody thought they were rich and went to a binge.\n Today in many cases the mortgages are now higher than the value of\n\nthe houses themselves. \n\n  In Jamaica people are rich beyond their means.\n They own houses and cars that they cannot afford to insure fully, and\n\nhave maintenance costs on other assets that in too many cases exceed the\n\npurchase price.\n If our banks made super profits on foreign exchange dealings two\n\nyears ago, the source of new profits has become the pursuit of paper...\n\nC.D.\'s at the Bank of Jamaica, and shares on the Stock Exchange. \n\n \n\n  Nobody is interested in real production... least of all the\n\npeople who cram the gallery at the Jamaica Stock Exchange four days a week.\n They can earn a lifetime\'s salary in a single trade, and have the\n\nhabit of going to work.\n Some sprout cellular phones instead of ears, and I understand earned\n\nin excess of\n\n$10 million each tax-free in 1992. \n\n \n\ndizzing   dizzying   heights?\n Unlike Japan in 1987 our currency is under pressure, we have a trade\n\ndeficit and no production to speak of to turn it around.\n Not a single company commanding these prices for their shares is an\n\nexemplar of performance.\n Indeed Jamaica Banana Producers share price doubled in recent weeks\n\nat a time when its core business is under serious threat from the loss of a\n\nprotected market in a unified Europe. \n\n  impossible to lose on\n\nthe Stock Exchange everybody has become an investment expert.\n They say blandly, that the share prices are rising because values are\n\ncorrecting for inflation.\n As I was reminded the year for major inflation was 1991, so the stock\n\nmarket should have corrected and stabilized in 1993. \n\n \n " On Tuesday May 26, 1992 the index stood at 6812.17, the volume\n\ntraded was 767299 for the\n\n$8.25 million.\n Since that time the Jamaican dollar has remained stable and interest\n\nrates have gone down.\n\n\n  " On Monday, February 1, 1993 the index was 32,062, the volume\n\ntraded was 8,021,520 shares for a value of an astounding\n\n$141,670,853.50.  In eight months alone the stock market index\n\nincreased by 270 per cent or 463 per cent on an annualized basis.\n\n\n  A complementary view this time from one of the country\'s leading\n\nbrokers, is \n " The value of a day\'s trade is now usually\n\n$40-50 million.\n On Monday it was\n\n$142 million, there was a lot of volume in the market therefore the market\n\nwas under pressure.\n A market going up in value would normally indicate that the market is\n\nshort on stock.\n But that is not the case here.\n What Monday really means is that people were taking profits, the\n\nseasoned players were getting out, but the new players were staying in and\n\nwill get their fingers burnt.\n It\'s very very dangerous.\n\n\n  So I sold the majority of my shares.\n I\'m going to put all the money in a Unit Trust where it might double\n\nin a year, will certainly be tax-free, and I\'ll be protected from the dangers\n\nof an over-heated stock exchange. \n\n \n\n  There is standing room only in the gallery at the Jamaica Stock\n\nExchange, and I don\'t have the inclination to study the daily trades of a\n\nstock market that defies all logic.\n Had I made\n\n$50 million last year by being a participant I would probably think\n\ndifferently.\n But I\'d certainly be out in 1992, sitting on a yacht, and leaving the\n\nslim pickings of a market that is    petering \n\n out to people who heard about the gold rush too late. \n\n  For those who are sitting on such yachts, I can recommend a new\n\nscheme to make money without producing anything.\n They can lodge\n\n$10 million late on a Friday to one unit trust and take it out on Monday\n\nalong with\n\n$500,000 capital appreciation, lodge the same money on Monday to the next\n\nunit trust and take it out on Tuesday with another\n\n$500,000 capital appreciation.\n They can make a million dollars in 60 hours.\n Since neither unit trust will have had the time to invest it, the\n\nmillion will have come from existing shareholders.\n The profit-takers on the stock market should have gone into ganja\n\ntrading.\n At least they would have produced something for the money they got...\n\na significant high for tens of thousands of people. \n\n  The analysts I talk to... and there are not many posing as such\n\nwho have even taken a basic course in investment... don\'t expect a crash on\n\nthe Jamaican Stock Exchange.\n But they do expect a significant correction, and are trying to be\n\nintelligent about advising people on what stocks to come out of. \n\n \n\nconsumers\'  purchasing power may stutter, we never hear about merchants\n\ngoing out of business, or companies going bankrupt.\n They are all selling smaller volumes at prices higher than when\n\nvolumes were average and reaping super profits.\n These cash wealthy companies, instead of re-investing in their\n\ncompanies and in real production, all have their agents lined up at the Bank\n\nof Jamaica and Stock Brokers to invest in paper.\n They don\'t earn money anymore, they just push it round and round and\n\nwatch it multiply like rabbits. \n\n  What worries me is whether or not our savings as a people has\n\nreal value.\n It seems that from the poorest to the richest we will have more money\n\nto spend, and it will buy only a quality of life that becomes more and more\n\npinched.\n This is a case of the Emperor\'s new clothes.\n We are all on the side watching him walk stark naked down the street,\n\nand complimenting him on the majesty of his robes.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  I CAN understand the revulsion felt by the average heterosexual\n\nmale at a homosexual act, for I myself share the revulsion; but I find it\n\nhard to understand the enormous hostility felt by so many people against\n\nhomosexuals as people.\n Is it because many men do not feel secure in their own\n\nheterosexuality, and so feel themselves threatened? \n\n  Moreover, there is an odd difference between the attitude of\n\npeople to female homosexuality.\n The \'normal\' woman does not as a rule boil with hostility towards\n\nfemale homosexuals, nor do men, even though they may not approve of it.\n And it is worth noting that while in England, for instance, there\n\nused to be laws against male homosexuals there never has been any such laws\n\nanywhere against lesbians.\n Why is there this difference?\n Is it that Christian fundamentalists call down brimstone and fire\n\nupon the heads of male homosexuals as a consequence of the myth of Sodom?\n\n\n\n  The questions seem apt at present because of recent events in the\n\nU.S.\n The new President Clinton, for instance, is finding much hostile\n\nopposition to his attempt to prevent the victimization of homosexuals in the\n\nU.S. armed forces, an opposition which is coming from the same sources as the\n\nopposition to his intention to legalize abortion. \n\n  It has been said by some authorities that one man in ten is\n\nhomosexual or at least bisexual.\n This estimate seems to me to be far too high.\n The latest research seems to indicate that people whose sex lives are\n\nexclusively homosexual make up about 4 per cent of the adult male population,\n\nand about 2 per cent of adult women.\n But certain professions show a widely different proportion.\n In the theatrical world, for instance, the proportion is far higher.\n Indeed, it seems that without homosexual men the arts of the theatre\n\nand dancing would be much the poorer.\n Men like Sir John Gielgud, the late Lord Olivier ( the actor, not the\n\nJamaican governor) the late Sir Noel Coward and the greatest of all ballet\n\ndancers Rudolf Nureyev ( who recently died at the age of 54 from AIDS) are\n\nmore typical of leading theatrical men than Rex Harrison who, it was always\n\nsaid, was the only famous actor of his day to be exclusively heterosexual.\n But in other fields many famous men have also been homosexual or\n\nbisexual; Keynes in Economics, Lord Mountbatten in high public office.\n The list of famous men who were or are homosexual is enormously\n\nlong,especially in the creative spheres. \n\n  Three teams of reputable scientists in America are searching for\n\nthe genes that cause homosexuality.\n Recent research has persuaded them that gay men for the most part\n\ninherit their sexual preferences and that these preferences are no more the\n\nresult of moral turpitude than the compulsion to drink suffered by the\n\nalcoholic.\n There are difficulties, of course, in defining homosexuality, for\n\nbeing homosexual means different things to different people.\n Many men, especially in Middle Eastern cultures, enjoy homosexual\n\nacts without seeing themselves as homosexuals.\n In the Middle East one must remember the stock joke; a woman for\n\nutility, a boy for joy, and a water melon for ecstasy.\n In other cultures there is a tendency to think that the penetrating\n\npartner is \'normally\' masculine whatever he happens to be penetrating.\n The ancient Greeks never made much of a distinction.\n It is only in Christian ( and I suppose Jewish) cultures that there\n\nhas been an attempt at a straightforward distinction. \n\n \n\n  Furthermore, while the average male, myself included, may well\n\nregard homosexual acts as distasteful, there are many heterosexual acts which\n\nare at least equally distasteful.\n I own a large encyclopaedia of unusual sexual practices, which lists\n\n750 of them.\n This ought to be compulsory reading for those fundamentalists who\n\nreserve their disapproval solely for homosexual acts.\n If it turns out that there is a genetic basis for homosexuality, male\n\nas well as female, then two matters will clearly arise.\n The first is that the homosexual should not be blamed for his\n\ncondition anymore than one would blame anyone for a hereditary disadvantage.\n\n\n\n  Secondly, a genetic basis would postulate the possibility of a\n\ncure.\n Many neurophysiologists believe that the differences between men\'s\n\nbrains and women\'s brains depend on events early in life, such as the release\n\nof male hormones by the testes of male foetuses.\n Sexual preferences may well fall into the same patterns.\n Some rats have been given injections that block male hormones in\n\nfoetuses.\n They develop as males except that they seek sex from other male\n\nrats.\n People are, of course, not rats, though I am not sure that I would\n\nuphold that generalisation as universally true.\n But some researchers have found differences between the brains of\n\nhomosexual and heterosexual men in parts of the brain noted for differences\n\nbetween men and women. \n\n  So, the research continues.\n In the meantime it would be eminently civilized, it seems to me, to\n\nlive and let live and to be tolerant of the sexual preferences of different\n\npeople.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'f35aeace-3f54-4b82-9ad6-ad56d7b382cd', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.489020+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9795103669166565, 'non_english_score': 0.020489633083343506}
{'text': "There is deep disregard for the masses in the minds of many\n\nleaders... a reluctance to face the fact that Jamaica is a black country.\n\n \n\n \n\n  MUCH has been said and written about the recently held Jamaica\n\nLabour Party annual conference, on some aspects, perhaps too much, while on\n\nothers, not enough.\n The jostling of media representatives in the Stadium car park, for\n\nexample, was taken out of the context of the general thuggery that prevailed\n\non the day and in the week prior to the event, and elevated to its own\n\nprominence.\n That is the way the news media gratuitously trumpets its own\n\nimportance. \n\n  It was undemocratic for political goons to prevent members of\n\nparliament and their supporters from voting at their party conference, but is\n\nwas a crime of unmentionable proportions to rough up a reporter on that same\n\noccasion.\n It was probably a good thing that the media was on the receiving end\n\nin the Stadium car park or there might not have been the same searching\n\nspotlight on the whole affair, even though there was a quite noticeable\n\nattempt at downplaying the whole business on the pages of one daily paper.\n\n\n\n  The election of Deputy Leaders and all the attendant display, were\n\nalso given full treatment by the media houses, each according to its own\n\ninternal bias.\n In at least one newsroom there was an agonizing split of loyalties\n\nbetween those traditionally supportive of the man who put them there in the\n\nfirst place, and affectionate regard for a son of the soil. I was not\n\nsurprised in the least by the raw and naked force brought to bear on the\n\nproceedings of the JLP conference. \n\n  Those of us who wish to continue the pretence of not knowing who\n\nthe perpetrators of political violence are in this country, may feel free to\n\nseek comfort in this charade.\n I know of no practising journalist who does not know all, most or\n\nenough of the truth on this subject.\n Why there is this general reluctance to write about it is not hard to\n\nimagine, and I am not about to attempt any finger-pointing on this score.\n\n\n\n \n\n  Suffice it to say, however, that not revealing the truth is one\n\nthing, willfully supporting that which is not, is entirely another.\n As journalists we know who we are, we know those among us who write\n\nfrom a base of genuinely held beliefs, and even when these beliefs seem to\n\nlack    objectivity   or accuracy, they can\n\nbe respected as being honourable.\n There is a wide, yawning chasm between bias and dishonesty which will\n\nnot accommodate any confusion of the two, either in the minds of the authors\n\nor their audience. \n\n  Mr. Shearer's statement has introduced a sadness into the hearts\n\nof all of those who have admired him over the years, and this sadness has\n\nbecome more entrenched with every attempt at explaining the utterance away.\n It was particularly upsetting because many Jamaicans have been\n\nlooking to him for the introduction of some sanity and respectability into\n\nthe affairs of the Party that has, more often than not, formed the Island's\n\ngovernments. \n\n  That there was not any perceivable effort on his part to bring\n\nsome element of democracy back into the Party's modus operandi was bad\n\nenough, because, for all we knew, he could have been exerting his\n\nconsiderable influence behind the scenes.\n But to allow himself to be used to bolster the sagging fortunes of\n\nMr. Seaga, and to do so in such a clumsy and insensitive manner is certainly\n\nunforgivable, and deserving of all the adverse comments that have been heaped\n\nupon his statement. \n\n  The worst aspect of the episode is that he and those who have\n\nattempted to explain his speech away might not even understand the gravity of\n\nhis statement, because there is such a deeply ingrained disregard for the\n\nmasses of this country in the minds of many of our leaders. \n\n  Over the years, there has been a pronounced reluctance to deal\n\nwith the simple statistical fact that Jamaica is a black country.\n Some of our pre- and post- Independence leaders have been so\n\nintimidated by the guilt of their conscious or sub  -  conscious\n\nbeliefs, that they viewed the blackness of our population as some kind of\n\nthreat, and have used all sorts of artificially inseminated devices to avoid\n\nthe truth. \n\n  One of our most ridiculous pronouncements as an independent\n\ncountry is contained in our motto.\n was clearly not meant to\n\nbe a cultural fact but a comfort for those who could not face the fact of a\n\nblack country being black.\n Indeed, a significant amount of the migration which has taken place\n\nin the years after, has some root in this real or perceived discomfort. \n\n  The population of this country is at least 95% black, therefore,\n\nthis is a black country.\n This is not to say that there is not room for the other races.\n On the contrary, the statistic should make for less of the kind of\n\nconflict which is sometimes present when the ethnic groups in a country are\n\nnumerically more competitive. \n\n  The discomfort arises in the minds of those who believe or have\n\nbeen brought up to believe that ones quality of life is founded to some\n\nextent on the premise that the so-called masses, are inferior to them.\n And as most will recognise, not long ago, this was not just a social\n\nphenomenon, but was an important part of the criteria brought to bear on\n\nemployment practices, banking practices, entry to educational institutions\n\nand the professions, and a number of other areas of life.\n We sometimes behave as though it was such a long time ago that a\n\nblack man by the name of Evon Blake, caused a furor by immersing himself into\n\nthe sacred 'whites only' waters of the Myrtle Bank Hotel. \n\n  The memories of those things which we have overcome should\n\nneither blind us to those that are still to be addressed, nor should they\n\ntempt us into merely switching the roles of the oppressor and oppressed.\n The United States has as large a percentage of non-white population\n\nas Jamaica has non-black, but while we have no difficulty in referring to the\n\nUSA as a white country, yet we balk at saying Jamaica is black.\n\n\nthis aspect of our growth that we have denied ourselves, then it has been of\n\nsome importance.\n I only wish it had not fallen from the lips of this great trade\n\nunionist and statesman. \n\n  Having said that, however, there is another aspect of the JLP\n\nConference which seems to have escaped the attention of commentators, and\n\nthat was Percy Broderick's sanky.\n It came in his introduction of the Party Leader at the public session\n\non Sunday, when there was no word of praise unused, no superlative unexplored\n\nin describing the man who had made his political life such a misery in the\n\n80s that he was literally forced into retirement. \n\n  Those of us who followed the fortunes of Percy Broderick over\n\nthose years, either as politician or Minister of Agriculture, until the\n\nbitter end when he had absolutely no say in his portfolio and the sector was\n\nrun by Mr. Seaga through that certain lady, can only be amazed that he could\n\neven contemplate returning to active political life under the same\n\nleadership, let alone stand on a public platform and sing his praises in 'C\n\nMajor'. \n\n  What was so peculiar about it was that there was a growing belief\n\nthat Percy might be a credible candidate for the leadership of the JLP when\n\nthe Party finally managed to rid itself of its present encumbrance.\n He had time on his side, having tasted of the joys of tension-free\n\nnights, and the success of efficient agricultural pursuits, he could well\n\nhave waited for a few more auspicious. \n\n  As it was, the timing of his return was one thing, the tone and\n\ntenure was entirely another.\n I, for one, am forced to take another look at this quite lovable\n\ncharacter, and to ask a number of questions, foremost of which is, does he\n\nknow what he is doing? \n\n  I can understand Bartlett's actions; he has simply swapped balls\n\nfor ballots, and when his political castration has healed and he can walk\n\nwithout a limp he will enjoy the special attention reserved for those who\n\nhave repented to the 'Lord'.\n He will of course speak in a high pitched voice, but it will be\n\nappropriate for the 'boys choir', and he will be happy. \n\n \n\n  Meanwhile, what of Messrs. Vaz, Anderson and Charles?\n Attempts to replace them in their own constituencies have failed, and\n\nthe searchlight that has been placed on the Party in the wake of the\n\ngoings-ons at the recent Conference would not easily permit any overtly\n\nundemocratic action.\n The gentlemen themselves have not made it clear what course of action\n\nthey mean to pursue, but I would expect that they would not just allow the\n\nwhole event to pass.\n Too much has now been done and said for there to be any possibility\n\nof a return to the fold. \n\n  The PNP, on the other hand, should take close note of those\n\npersons who were wearing 'security' shirts at the JLP Conference and ask\n\nthemselves a number of important questions.\n Where did these persons come from, who were willing and able to rough\n\nup senior Members of Parliament? \n\n  Were some from the Shower Posse which has gained such notoriety\n\nand inspired such adverse publicity for Jamaica in the USA?\n Was one the new 'Don' that has replaced Jim Brown?\n If the JLP was willing to mount this kind of 'operation' on its own\n\nlong- serving members, at its own internal elections, when all that was at\n\nstake is the preferences of the leadership, what would it contemplate at a\n\ngeneral election, when the government of the country is the prize? \n\n  Today, twelve years after the election which carried with it a\n\nscenario that we all hope never to revisit, we would be unwise not to look\n\nseriously at certain events and think carefully about their implications for\n\nlocal elections, which are just around the corner, and general election, two\n\nyears or so down the road.\n In this exercise, ought we not to be considering yet again, the\n\nrelationship between political violence and the general crime scene, and the\n\nability of our security forces to deal with persons whose funerals make\n\nfashion statements and attract national news coverage?  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Few educated people in our part of the world maintain their\n\nchildhood fascination with the Bible.\n The educated religious people are satisfied with the knowledge of the\n\nBible acquired in childhood, though they have become much more educated in\n\nBusiness and Economics.\n The theology of the child evangelist is as developed as that of the\n\naverage adult Christian.\n Despite the pervasive biblical illiteracy, every religious person\n\nfancies himself or herself as an authority on the Bible.\n Some bestow upon themselves great illumination because they belong to\n\nthe 'right' or 'peculiar' church; others figure that the Holy Spirit renders\n\ntheir knowledge superior whether or not they have been diligent in study.\n\n\n\n  Some time ago I met a minister whom I had taught many years\n\nbefore.\n He was very happy to see me again.\n After all, he had enjoyed my teaching, though he didn't agree with\n\nall I had taught, he told me.\n I asked him to give an example of what I had taught he didn't agree\n\nwith.\n Well, I had told him that the children of Israel did not cross the\n\nRed Sea from Egypt but the See of Reeds ( or the Sea of Rushes).\n He was making it sound as if I had expressed an opinion when all I\n\nhad tried to tell him was that the word translated 'Red Sea' is actually the\n\nHebrew '  Yam Suph  ' , which a glance at the map would\n\nshow could not refer to what we know as the Red Sea.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5f585b40-8182-4587-9596-06dc35370632', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.490496+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9868427515029907, 'non_english_score': 0.013157248497009277}
{'text': 'It has always been my misfortune never to be in favour of the\n\npolitical party that is elected to govern. \n\n  Needless to say this has terrible consequences for my company\'s\n\nbusiness, compounded now by the fact that in addition to unmasking\n\npoliticians, this column has taken to unmasking the rich and powerful.\n Another twenty years of writing and I\'ll be lucky to get a glass of\n\nwater, much less a contract. \n\n  I long ago decided however, that the fun of writing this column\n\nwas worth any price I had to pay for it.\n Unlike the people I write about therefore, I don\'t take myself\n\nseriously. \n\n  The quality I dislike most in politicians and the self-important\n\nis sincerity... and it makes them terribly dull.\n All of them sincerely believe that the act of feathering their own\n\nindividual nest spontaneously produces economic and social benefit for the\n\ncountry.\n A politician elected to govern makes absolutely no difference to my\n\nlife, only to his own.\n He or she gets a government house, a car, dozens of bodyguards, a\n\ncellular phone, a Rolex watch and a gun.\n On the other hand all the public gets are new names and faces which\n\nby the time we recognise them they are voted out of office. \n\n  When a politician, who is always seeking office, whether in or\n\nout of it, talks about the positive difference he intends to make I know it\'s\n\ntime to leave.\n They talk about the needs of the masses, the need for foreign\n\ninvestment, and are proud of the fact that it costs them\n\n$5,000 in\n\n$20 bills to walk through part of their constituencies.\n\n\n  This kind of conversation is witless.\n Some corporate patron gave them the\n\n$5,000 to give away to their constituents, and all the wider masses get from\n\npoliticians is a lot of chest-thumping talk which is why the masses only\n\nattend if dance-hall music and gigantic speakers are there.\n The politician thinks they come for him, they really come for the \'Bogle\'\n\nand the \'Butterfly\'.\n Indeed if the JLP hadn\'t made Half Pint\'s \'Raggamuffin\' their anthem\n\nin the late 80\'s, no one would have attended at all. \n\n \n\n  I think that Michael Manley and Edward Seaga used to catch their\n\ncandidates on the wing with a net, lock them in a cage at party headquarters\n\nand throw the training manual of the Seventh Day Adventists and the Mormons\n\nat them.\n This made political candidates totally useless to the wider society.\n All they could do was recite, parrot- fashion, a lot of nineteenth\n\ncentury hokum of interest only to gunmen and people who had never acquired\n\nthe habit of reading.\n Small wonder then that they bored not only the electorate, but\n\neventually their own leaders, particularly Eddie Seaga, who knew that it\n\nwould never be necessary to acquire the habit of listening to them. \n\n  The disgraced politician is therefore an altogether better class\n\nof person.\n It has been said that the political party in Jamaica does not\n\nencourage independent thought among its members. The truth is that it does\n\nnot encourage thought at all.\n This is why they routinely expel their intelligent members out of\n\nconcern that these will set a bad example.\n that what is said within the party exactly\n\nconforms to the dictates of its religious manual. \n\n  One is not merely expelled for the crime of being bright, one is\n\nexcommunicated to make sure the society understands that it is to ostracize\n\npermanently, this individual.\n According to the political manuals, there is no greater social\n\ndisgrace than this excommunication, yet those who have been so ostracized\n\nhave gone on to become successful historians, lawyers and keepers of the holy\n\ngrail themselves. \n\n  It seems clear therefore, that our political parties will have to\n\nchange their training manuals.\n All it does is to create door to door evangelists whom no one wants\n\nto let into their homes, and elected officials that no sensible Prime\n\nMinister could possibly leave to act on their own initiative since that was\n\ncarefully trained out of them from the outset. \n\n  It used to be when I was a child, that a politician was someone a\n\ntruck driver could waste time with on a cement wall.\n The politician talked cheerfully about all sorts of things, and\n\ndidn\'t immediately try to sell a bible.\n Sometimes he would not even try to sell the bible, and just got the\n\nvote because he seemed a nice sort of person. \n\n \n\n  Today the politician doesn\'t bother with conversation, he\n\npresents his bible first and tries to make you feel guilty because you don\'t\n\nbelieve his party is the word of God.\n In the old days they had sophistication, today they remind me of the\n\nback  -  yard Crusaders trying to take a civilizing cause to Moslems\n\nwho will ultimately give them knowledge of Mathematics and Medicine if they\n\nremain long enough in Turkish jails. \n\n  Like the Crusaders, Jamaican politicians have wasted the\n\ncountry\'s substance over thirty years in their  " civilizing" \n\ntourist resorts without adequate sewerage, government offices duplicating\n\nfunctions, and a welter of legislation either not enforced or if enforced,\n\npreventing people from producing for export. \n\n  So sincerity in older politicians is the basis of the good\n\nintentions that paved the way to this hell.\n Its presence in young politicians is a guarantee that they have no\n\nnew ideas, and must rely upon the thread-bare thinking of their predecessors.\n\n\n  These things do not exist in the Jamaica Labour Party, and if\n\nthey do in the People\'s National Party, they are being carefully hidden for\n\nfear of antagonizing Mr. Seaga. \n\n  I am told that the selection of candidates for the next General\n\nElection is based entirely on their mediocrity.\n Anything else they say would only open candidates to unnecessary\n\nattack by political opponents, who, unused to excellence, would find it\n\nSatanic.\n The heat generated by such an onslaught would doubtless lose them the\n\nelection.\n Based on experience therefore, both parties have concluded that\n\nmediocrity is the safest path to glory.  \n\n \n\n\n \n\n \n\n  who had been\n\nbooked for major surgery two-and-a-half months beforehand.\n He chose to have the surgery done at the University Hospital because\n\nof the high standard of specialist medical attention which is available.\n Though the services supplied by the doctors fully justified that\n\nreputation, the hospital-stay turned into the most extraordinary nightmare I\n\nhave been through in some time.\n\n\n  We checked in on Monday morning at 8:30. By 11 o\'clock we were\n\nstill sitting in the chairs where we had been asked to sit on arrival.\n Eventually, a nurse appeared in front of me.\n\n\n I had been warned.\n\n\n\n Apparently, if I had not brought any sheets with me, we would still\n\nbe sitting there! \n\n  We went into the small side-ward where we set about making up a\n\nbed on which there was the mattress which proved to have a hole straight\n\nthrough it with a diameter of roughly two feet, about the level of the base\n\nof a person\'s spine.\n It was clearly an impossible proposition for anyone who is also\n\nsuffering from back problems.\n We complained.\n A brand-new electrically operated surgical bed arrived within\n\nminutes.\n From where, one wonders, did this bed come, and to whom was the\n\ndefective one given? \n\n  Having made up the bed, I made the mistake of looking around this\n\nsmall room.\n The bell in this isolated room obviously had not worked for some\n\nyears, nor was there any other device to summon help!\n Sick and weak patients must apparently find the strength to yell!\n The walls were filthy with grime, the ceiling stained with a gigantic\n\nblack water mark made by a huge leak at some time in the past.\n Cobwebs hung down, festooning the windows facing the corridor, and a\n\nsmell of drains blew in from outside.\n Greasy dust lay a quarter of an inch thick on the top and the shelves\n\nof the only clothes  -  closet that was built into the wall, and that\n\ndid not contain even one wire hanger. \n\n  For four days no cleaner entered that room.\n On the fifth day, at three o\'clock on Friday afternoon, a large lady\n\nentered the room, and proceeded to push a dry-mop with one hand lazily across\n\nthe floor.\n\n " There is a pool of dried blood on the floor by my bed that no dry-\n\nmop will take up." \n The lady nodded and went out.\n She soon returned with a small tin-can containing some bleach which\n\nshe threw over the pool of dried blood and briefly pushed a wet mop over ONLY\n\nTHAT AREA of the room. \n\n \n\n  When I complained about the extraordinary degree of filth in the\n\nsupposedly aseptic conditions of a hospital, a doctor who is a member of the\n\nMedical Faculty, informed me that the hospital administration and the unions\n\nwho represent the cleaning staff had agreed that the cleaners do not have to\n\nclean anything above waist level!\n If this is true, who exactly is to clean the dust, grime and cobwebs\n\nabove waist level? \n\n  During most of the nights of the patient\'s sojourn, the intercom\n\nsystem of the hospital blasted out the inane preachings of a minister all\n\nnight long.\n Eventually, the patient, unable to sleep even though under heavy\n\nsedation, managed to get the attention of one of the night nurses, to ask\n\nthat the racket be discontinued.\n " does it disturb you?"\n\n , and reduced the volume to a bearable level for the rest of that\n\nnight.\n Could it be the hospital staff have not heard of the detrimental\n\neffects of noise pollution? \n\n  As is usual after surgery, a drip, feeding saline and medication\n\ndirectly into a vein in the arm of the patient, had been set up.\n After two days the drip, still needed to provide nutrition and\n\nessential medication to the patient, had to be resited as the flow had\n\nstopped.\n This is normally a fairly simple procedure of finding a different\n\nvein into which to insert the needle which is connected to the drip.\n To my astonishment, it appears that, in the University Hospital, the\n\nforemost teaching hospital in the West Indies, no nurse is now able to do\n\nthis.\n For six hours the patient waited unattended while the nurses made a\n\nhalf-hearted search by telephone to contact either of the two doctors on\n\ncall. \n\n  But all this can only be considered typical of a standard of\n\nnursing which was encountered: this varied from the inept, through the\n\nindifferent to the outright ignorant.\n Perhaps it is not surprising that we are said to be managing to\n\nrecruit so many more trainee nurses ( and there appeared to be at least a\n\ndozen of them around in that ward alone), for we must be asking very little\n\nof their scholastic qualifications when even the qualified nurses are\n\nrequired to do nothing more onerous than the regular doling out of pills and\n\nthe taking of the  temperature and blood pressure! \n\n  The day after surgery, a doctor, apparently quite serious, told\n\nus of a young nurse with him in the operating theatre who, on completion of\n\nan operation for the removal of a kidney stone remarked on looking at the\n\nitem which had been removed, \n\n\n\n\n The doctor, thinking that there was a genuine thirst for further\n\nknowledge, proceeded to give the nurse a succinct lecture on the formation of\n\nkidney stones.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '25a10b38-79bd-4c44-9e5c-d006ca1c9629', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.491692+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9835956692695618, 'non_english_score': 0.016404330730438232}
{'text': 'MEXICO has the second largest economy in the Latin American region\n\nwith an average gross domestic product of US$3,412 per capita.\n Nonetheless, the country does not escape the problem of rampant\n\npoverty.\n According to 1991 figures of the United Nations Economic Commission\n\nfor Latin America and the Caribbean, 48.8% of Mexico\'s 82 million inhabitants\n\nlive below the poverty level.\n This factor has forced the Mexican government to create and implement\n\na social programme to alleviate the plight of the under  -  class.\n\n\n\n  Social programmes as a general rule are costly to governments.\n However, when President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office on\n\nDecember 1, 1988, he made a brazen promise to address Mexico\'s urgent social\n\nneeds before waiting for the national economy to recover as a whole.\n The following day, President Salinas\'s first act in office was to\n\ncreate the National Solidarity Programme, a do-it-yourself type anti-poverty\n\nplan aimed at providing and/or improving basic facilities for the country\'s\n\npoor addressing areas which include job creation, health, education, and\n\nnutrition. \n\n  Since President Salinas has set out to embark on a tight economic\n\npolicy upon entering office, which included balancing the budget, controlling\n\ninflation, and exercising strict fiscal discipline, Solidarity was precluded\n\nfrom being financed by printing more money or increasing public expenditure.\n Instead, funds have been sourced from renegotiation of the foreign\n\ndebt, privatisation of public enterprises, and to a lesser extent from funds\n\ncontributed by the private sector.\n The initial amount available for the Solidarity fund was US$820\n\nmillion in 1989 and this figure has increased to US$2.2 billion in 1992.\n In fact, between 1988 and 1992, general spending in social welfare in\n\nMexico has increased by 60%. \n\n  Unlike our Solidarity programme here in Jamaica, its Mexican\n\nnamesake does much more than provide loans through a venture capital fund to\n\nstart small businesses.\n As some of its main thrusts, it has sought to provide medical\n\nservices in rural areas to improve the distribution of basic foodstuffs in\n\nlow-income areas; to increase material infrastructure for education and to\n\nimprove infrastructure especially, but not exclusively, in poverty stricken\n\nurban areas. \n\n  The two latter thrusts should be of great interest to countries\n\nlike ours with scarce economic resources and much need for improvement of\n\ninfrastructure.\n To begin, the Solidarity Programme\'s priorities in each community are\n\ndetermined by the beneficiaries.\n Members of communities in need of improvement must organize\n\nthemselves and apply for the funds to carry out a selected project.\n When it is approved, they are provided with the funds to purchase the\n\nnecessary materials and a civil engineer to coordinate the project.\n The difference lies in the fact that completion of the project is\n\nleft up to the beneficiaries. \n\n  When the plan was first proposed it was met with much skepticism,\n\nbut quickly caught on. By 1991 over 10 square kilometres of road had been\n\npaved and 340,000    square   metres of sidewalks\n\nbuilt.\n Not to mention a number of other improvements including the creation\n\nof recreational areas, the installation of street lighting and running water\n\nin neighbourhoods, and the refurbishing of schools.\n The programme is cost-effective because citizen participation\n\ndrastically cuts labour cost.\n It is estimated that Solidarity road building projects cost 30% less\n\nthan those undertaken by government contractors, and school refurbishing\n\ncosts are cut by an average of 40%. \n\n \n\n  As is expected, these community projects have their share of\n\nproblems mainly because participants know little about the work on which they\n\nare embarking.\n Materials are often wasted in the initial stages and lessons are\n\nlearned through trial and error.\n Conversely, however, when the project is completed much pride is\n\ntaken in the final result and more care is taken to maintain it. \n\n  brainchild has attracted the\n\nattention not only of many Latin American countries, but also China and\n\nIndia, which have all sent delegations to observe and learn from the Mexican\n\nexperience.\n In fact, Argentina has already begun implementing an anti-poverty\n\nprogramme with a self-help component based on the Mexican model. \n\n  Jamaica would do well to follow suit, be it by expanding on our\n\nexisting Solidarity programme or creating a new anti-poverty scheme.\n If this were done, instead of schools which are in much need of\n\nrepair waiting to be \'adopted\' by a private company, parents, teachers, and\n\nstudents could organize themselves and carry out the necessary repairs after\n\nreceiving the financial assistance to purchase the inputs.\n Sidewalks could be built in certain communities to put a stop to\n\nchildren playing in the streets.\n Much needed toilet facilities or common washing areas could be\n\ninstalled in urban and rural low- income communities.\n The list of possible and very necessary improvements goes on and on.\n More importantly, these projects could be carried out on an ongoing\n\nbasis, and not just a token once per year on Labour Day which is simply not\n\nenough.\n It is understood that the Mexican government\'s budget far exceeds\n\nthat of Jamaica\'s, but in Jamaica the project could start on a small scale\n\nand gradually increase without putting too much of a strain on government\n\ncoffers.\n Furthermore, in Jamaica this type of programme would more easily\n\nattract non-governmental contributions as results of contributions would be\n\nvisible. \n\n \n\ngovernmet   government   - and it should be - it would\n\nundoubtedly meet with resistance just as it did in Mexico, and maybe even on\n\na larger scale.\n\n\n  began   people would realize the benefits which\n\ncould be derived from same, and it is bound to catch on. \n\n  It is a known fact of human nature that persons will take better\n\ncare of that which they have had to attain, than something that has been\n\nhanded to them.\n The recently renewed effort in Kingston toward beautifying\n\nneighbourhoods by citizens painting murals has been a step in the right\n\ndirection.\n We now need to look beyond cosmetic improvements however, to those\n\nwhich will tangibly improve the plight of the underprivileged.\n Mexico is showing us a way of achieving just that, are we going to\n\nfollow suit?  \n\n \n\n\n \n\n  of August 12\n\nof the finalists of the Spelling Bee I couldn\'t help wondering once again\n\nwhat it is that gives the girls such an advantage over the boys.\n As it turned out all the top places except two were girls.\n\n\n  Is the capacity to spell correctly a universal trait among girls\n\nor is it only in Jamaica that they demonstrate this superiority?\n\n\n  I suspect that it may be a special Jamaican quality:\n for our women are formidable.\n They out-perform our males in every circumstance in which they have\n\nthe opportunity to do so.\n They do better at school and are rapidly establishing a dominance in\n\nthe world of business.\n Indeed one of Jamaica\'s troubles is the inadequacy of our males,\n\nincluding their shortcomings as heads of families.\n As someone pointed out to me the other day there is only one case in\n\nwhich our males are better balanced.\n\n\n  To return to spelling, one wonders whether the capacity to spell\n\ncorrectly has, in general, something to do with being feminine.\n As the Olympics have demonstrated, anabolic steroids have proven very\n\nuseful, though up to now illegal, in improving certain kinds of athletic\n\nperformance.\n Could it not be that careful doses of female hormones, the oestrogens\n\nfor example, administered to the boys might improve their ability to spell\n\ncorrectly? \n\n  I write the above with some trepidation.\n The male ego is extremely fragile, shattering upon the smallest\n\nimpact, and it worries me as a male to feel that males, after all our claims\n\nto the contrary, may be the weaker sex needing doses of female hormones to\n\npep us up a bit.\n At this point I must admit that I am weak at spelling.\n I am sure that even today after a lifetime of writing I would be\n\nbeaten by any of those cute little schoolgirls were I to enter a spelling\n\nbee.\n I have serious difficulties with double letters and can never\n\nremember, for instance, whether " \'skilfully\' " is spelt\n\nwith three Ls instead of four. \n\n \n\n  We all tend to find comforting reasons for our shortcomings.\n It is fashionable today to blame nearly everything upon our\n\nenvironment.\n Criminals are excused their criminality by attributing it to poor\n\nenvironment, yet I have always suspected that lousy environments are created\n\nby lousy people instead of the other way around.\n I therefore try in vain to excuse my weakness in spelling by blaming\n\nmy nursery governess when what perhaps I should be blaming is a deficiency in\n\nthe oestrogens, in much the same way as diabetics can blame their disease\n\nupon a natural shortage of insulin.\n I am encouraged in this view by the knowledge that Shakespeare\'s\n\nspelling was so poor that he couldn\'t even spell his own name the same way\n\ntwice running. \n\n  There is still a matter, though, which is worthy of\n\nconsideration.\n Do our young champion spellers understand the meaning of most of the\n\nwords they so correctly spell?\n Should not then a spelling competition also include a competition in\n\ndefinition?\n For what is the point of being able to spell a word you don\'t\n\nunderstand? \n\n  Although I think the Question Master was extraordinarily good I\n\nwas also a bit taken aback by his choice of so many words that were more\n\nFrench than English. I suppose that in order not to confuse the contestants\n\nhe did not pronounce \'impasse\' as \'ampasse\', as it should be, and I think it\n\nwas a bit hard to set the word \'escargot\' to children who had never had the\n\nchance of attending an expensive restaurant.\n And not everybody can be expected to know that an \'X\' at the end of a\n\nFrench word indicates the plural.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  Most mushrooms are edible and many are great delicacies.\n\n\n  concerning a\n\nnumber of people in Russia who had been poisoned by mushrooms and it reminded\n\nme of a splendid story of colonial Jamaica which, though well known in some\n\ncircles, ought, I think, to deserve a wider circulation. \n\n  Lady Barker, a charming and graceful lady of the old school, now\n\ndead, was noted for her select and socially important dinner parties.\n For one such special occasion, she had invited the Governor, the\n\nColonial Secretary and some important English visitors together with their\n\nwives to dinner at her home. \n\n  During the morning a street vendor had come by selling mushrooms\n\nand thinking that these would add distinction to her menu Lady Barker bought\n\nthe lot. \n\n  But as a precaution she wanted to be certain that the mushrooms\n\nwere not poisonous so she instructed her maid to feed some to the dog and\n\ncarefully to observe the consequences. \n\n  The day passed uneventfully and the dog flourished.\n\n\n  Hardly had they been eaten, however, when an agitated maid\n\nwhispered to Lady Barker,  " please ma\'am de darg dead"  .\n\n\n\n  Lady Barker was an honest and brave woman.\n She announced to her guests that they had unfortunately just ingested\n\npoisonous mushrooms.\n Some started immediately to feel ill.\n Doctors were summoned.\n Stomach pumps were called into play.\n Lady Barker\'s select dinner party ended in chaos and confusion, some\n\nguests still vomiting. \n\n  As soon as the last guest had gone Lady Barker summoned the maid.\n\n\n .\n\n " De darg run over in de street,"  the maid replied. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  THE disaster which hit St. Thomas last week Tuesday night after\n\nheavy showers pelted the parish and claimed the life of nine-year-old Gilbert\n\nBrown, must be blamed on poor drainage, the unavailability of land for\n\nhousing, the shortcomings of the St. Thomas Parish Council and Public Works\n\nDepartment among other factors.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '2cd9d2f7-7a4d-483a-b7c3-62b911a7d553', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.492917+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9758816957473755, 'non_english_score': 0.02411830425262451}
{'text': "TRYING to stop bandoolooism in this country is like trying to take\n\na close-up shot of the horizon.\n It is impossible because of the dismal ways things are in the island.\n\n\n\n  As I have said many times before:\n we believe in correcting situations by using public relations methods.\n In other words, tell the people in the building that the heat they are\n\nfeeling is not from the fact that the building is on fire, but rather that\n\nthe air-conditioned system has broken down.\n We are going to kill many people in this country one day by our\n\nzealous public relations efforts to paint over the cracks, instead of finding\n\nmethods of properly fixing the cracks. \n\n  Now, there are some very nice people working in the field of\n\npublic relations... some are working in their own outfits and some are\n\nworking in big private and public sector organizations.\n Those working in the public sector must carry the line of their\n\nbosses ( and I do not mean the taxpayers who are usually the victims) or pack\n\ntheir bags.\n I suppose the situation is not as crucial in the private sector,\n\nexcept where that private sector enterprise is a monopoly and offers a\n\nservice that must be used by the public at large. \n\n  There are also very nice people making public relations\n\nstatements for the public utilities.\n Personally, however, I no longer pay serious attention to most of the\n\nstatements put out by the public utilities because a lot of it is garbage.\n I developed this attitude while working in the RJR newsroom for 25\n\nyears.\n Any good newsman will tell you that if he's chummy with the PR people\n\nin the utilities he will get the real story off-the- record, which is the\n\ntotal opposite of the official PR statement directed at the public, many of\n\nwhom are now wise to the practice which is for practical purposes a\n\nphenomenon. \n\n  Sunday\n\nGleaner's  lead story about the likelihood of whopping phone bills.\n The story said that unsuspecting ICAS code customers could be getting\n\nwhopping telephone bills within the next few weeks, owing to a break  -\n\n down in the protection system of the Jamaica Telephone Company about two\n\nmonths ago, and the widespread illegal use of ICAS codes. \n\n The  Sunday Gleaner  story by Gordon Williams, said that it is\n\nunderstood that during an exercise to upgrade certain systems, the threshold\n\nsystem of the phone company, which protects owners of the International Call\n\nAuthorisation System ( ICAS) from fraud broke down.\n The story went on to say that the phone company did not officially\n\nacknowledge the breakdown of the threshold system.\n It said that when public relations manager Errol Miller was contacted\n\non July 22, he said the number of illegal overseas calls had dropped\n\ndramatically since ICAS was introduced in August 1989, and there was no\n\nsignificant increase this year in the illegal use of codes as compared to\n\nlast year which reportedly amounted to one-point-two million dollars. Before\n\nICAS the loss per year was said to be in the region of 70 million dollars.\n If the protective system has broken down and the people start getting\n\nastronomical bills of overseas calls they did not make, the official line\n\nwill prove to be nothing more than a lie.\n As consumers we have found our public utilities have a serious\n\nproblem in telling the truth. \n\n  also carried a story which stated\n\nthat nearly 30 phone company workers have been fired for ICAS fraud.\n This is not surprising as most of us have heard the allegations that\n\nsome staff members were selling  codes to people who do\n\nnot own such codes.\n\n\n  I am very convinced that the executives and public relations\n\nofficers of the utilities live in a world that's different from ours.\n I know about three spots in the Corporate Area where illegal overseas\n\ntelephone calls are sold on a daily basis to many people, one of whom told me\n\nthat the average cost of a call is fifty dollars.\n I know of many places inside and outside of the Corporate Area where\n\nmany residents receive the electricity and domestic water supplies free of\n\ncost.\n These areas are in addition to the so-called garrison constituencies,\n\nwhere some residents, for political reasons, believe they should not pay for\n\nanything.\n Our political system is a supporter to the honing of the skills of\n\nbrigands.\n These people tap telephone lines, power lines and the domestic water\n\nsupply system.\n They do not pay for any of these services.\n Guess who pays?\n\n\n  The public utilities dare not move against most of the offenders,\n\nwho smartly, insulate themselves in the garrison constituencies.\n The way things are going, soon we will no longer have any honest,\n\noverburdened taxpayer.\n In order for them to survive they will have to join the band of\n\nbrigands and steal the services of the public utilities as they are fast\n\nbecoming unaffordable to the ordinary wage earner.\n And by the way, it is time we come up with a new national dish as\n\nmost people can no longer afford the price of saltfish, which is an important\n\ningredient in the national dish:  'ackee and saltfish.' \n ?\n There's a lot of it around these days.\n How does a nation, a small one like ours, explain the third outbreak\n\nof typhoid in less than three years in the parish of Westmoreland?\n Unfortunately, hot air etc., alone cannot stop people from dying from\n\na disease created by unsanitary living conditions, which should have been\n\ncorrected from the first outbreak.\n No PR-fix can gloss over the cracks in Westmoreland. If the emphasis\n\nwere placed on accountability instead of excuses in the administration of the\n\nutilities and other services in the private and public sector this country\n\nwould be better off.\n will\n\ncontinue to spread like wildfire.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  SOME of our journalists and media people have been doing an\n\nexcellent job of trying to keep the public informed by presenting us with\n\nfacts, figures and informed opinions that help us to get a better grasp \n\n  of   our reality. \n\n  than any\n\nother information media have a potential to explore issues in depth.\n Now that competition has been restored in the daily newspaper\n\nbusiness, we hope that it will generate more informed columns and commentary\n\non news. \n\n  I criticise journalists and columnists harshly when I think they\n\ndeserve it.\n But we must also praise them when they produce quality work and\n\ninformative pieces that contribute to a better understanding of our reality.\n\n\n\n  Columnists like Carl Wint and Raymond Forrest deserve special\n\npraise for the informative content of their columns and their continuous\n\neffort to present the public with researched facts in contrast to some others\n\nwho do nothing but parade personal opinions some of which are most\n\nill-informed and misleading. \n\n  Also in this category of highly informed commentary are the\n\nrecent columns by Chester Burgess on the Jamaican economy and Max Lamble's\n\ncomparison of Jamaica's economic performance and economic policies compared\n\nto Latin America and the Far East. \n\n  When informative comments are written, however, their value is\n\nlost if we do not discuss them, regardless of whether we agree or disagree\n\nwith their conclusions or their facts. \n\n  Wint's recent column using data drawn from a comparative\n\ninternational study of quality of life indicators to demonstrate that Jamaica\n\nfalls among middle income developing countries rather than among the very\n\npoor is a timely reminder of our reality.\n I could not agree with him more on our tendency to complain and\n\nagonise as if we have always been at the bottom of the pile of Third World\n\npoverty.\n Anyone who has visited or travelled to countries like India,\n\nEthiopia, Somalia, Bangladesh, Bolivia and Haiti where poverty exists on a\n\nscale far beyond anything imagined in Jamaica can provide volumes of\n\nconfirmation of what Carl Wint is saying. \n\n \n\n  There is however, an important dimension of reality that Wint's\n\ndata and excellent analysis leaves out.\n Much of the dramatic improvements in quality of life in Jamaica\n\noccurred in the early post  -  war years and up to the 1960s when\n\nJamaica was regarded by many as one of the Third World's high-growth\n\neconomies.\n\n\n life of all classes and especially among the poor experienced\n\nconsiderable improvement and enhancement.\n However, in the past two decades our situation ( and especially that\n\nof the poorer classes and the lower middle class) has deteriorated quite\n\nrapidly. \n\n  For example in the late nineteen fifties when I left high school\n\nno high school graduate had any problems finding a job.\n When I started working in 1958, my salary as a junior clerk could pay\n\nthe rent for a three-bedroom house in most middle class neighbourhoods.\n In the early 1950s my mother, a primary school teacher, could afford\n\nto buy a three-bedroom house in a middle class neighbourhood.\n All of these things now seem almost like fairy tales in the 1990s and\n\nthey have all changed drastically for the worst due to inflation and currency\n\ndevaluation and our failure to increase the country's income and production\n\nlevels. \n\n  The fact accounts for much of the gloom and doom and the\n\nhopelessness and pessimism contemporary Jamaicans express, as Carl Wint\n\ncorrectly points out. \n\n  But how could the quality of life improve or even stabilise in an\n\neconomy that has not grown significantly in real output over the past two\n\ndecades?\n Unless we restore a pattern of significant, solid and positive\n\neconomic growth ( as occurred here in the 1950s, the 1960s and between 1986\n\nand 1988) our society is threatened with a regression back to the 1930s.\n Appreciation of that fact is part of what motivates the pessimism and\n\nsense of hopelessness among many Jamaicans. \n\n  Given this reality, I am frankly surprised that so many Jamaicans\n\nare not giving up but are trying and are struggling against great odds to\n\novercome the economic and social pressures unavoidable in a country\n\nexperiencing a prolonged period of no long- term economic growth.\n There are no countries anywhere in the world that can match our\n\nexperience of prolonged no growth in the absence of war and major natural\n\ndisaster.\n Jamaica has earned a place in the Guiness Book of records of negative\n\neconomic performance. \n\n  Chester Burgess's recent long column on the economy is a sober\n\nand insightful reminder of the depth of our economic problems.\n It should be read by all those who want to understand what has been\n\nhappening to the Jamaican economy and especially by Mr. Herbert Hart.  column demonstrates how far some non-economists have a deep\n\ngrasp of    our   economic reality.\n analysis is the absence of\n\nadequate treatment of the agenda of opportunities for growth and expansion\n\nthat exist in our economy and the failure of our private sector to grasp\n\nthese opportunities as is happening to other countries with similar problems\n\nbut which are forging and finding solutions ( Chile, Mexico, Argentina,\n\nBrazil etc).\n Appearances from our long agenda of economic problems obscure the\n\nlarge agenda of investment opportunities that exist here in tourism,\n\nmanufacturing, agriculture, agro industry and other such areas.\n Chester needs to do a follow-up piece to take us through some\n\nsuggestions of how we might begin to grasp this agenda of opportunity to turn\n\naround this economy. \n\n  Max Lambie and Dr. Artnell Henry have fired some shots of\n\ncriticism at our private sector.\n Dr. Henry told it like is while Lambie's criticisms were less\n\ndramatic but equally serious.\n Both in different ways were telling the private sector that they are\n\nnot ready to hold their ground in the rapidly globalised world economy.\n Dr. Henry has exposed the absence of an adequate concern for\n\nstandards and quality among many Jamaican manufacturers, a reality which many\n\nconsumers can confirm.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '6960c150-288f-4f23-b695-faaaf842a9b2', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.494425+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9720789194107056, 'non_english_score': 0.027921080589294434}
{'text': 'SPECULATION is rife about an impending General Election.\n The speculation is fueled by, among other things, the Government\'s\n\nrecently held retreat; the JLP\'s leadership impasse; and Prime Minister\n\nPatterson\'s  " profiling"  ( read socialising).\n Incidentally, whoever is handling the Prime Minister\'s publicity must\n\nbe careful of causing overkill.\n The impression is being formed that the Prime Minister spends too much\n\ntime sporting.\n It is a similar view that Americans hold about President George Bush\n\nwho always seems to be out fishing or playing golf.\n\n\n  Should the Patterson Administration call General Elections soon?\n Are there any justifiable reasons?\n Let\'s define the term \'soon\'.\n The voters list and attendant measures will not be in place before\n\nOctober this year.\n In addition it is now a convention that general elections are not\n\nheld during the start of the Winter Tourist Season.\n That suggests February/March 1993 as the earliest possible date.\n Other factors also support a six/seven months timetable: the\n\nscheduled reduction of the rate of income tax to 25% during the early months\n\nof next year, and the likely revaluation/ stabilization of the exchange rate\n\nresulting from tourism inflows. \n\n  Now that we have established a likely timetable, let\'s examine\n\nthe issues that are likely to inform a decision to call early elections.\n It is true that the problems afflicting the Opposition Jamaica Labour\n\nParty makes it a sitting duck for the ruling People\'s National Party ( PNP).\n Prior to the brawl which occurred at its recent annual conference the\n\nJLP was leading the PNP in opinion polls.\n Now it is likely that the PNP has reversed the earlier trend.\n If this is so, is it a signal from the electorate that parliamentary\n\nelections be called?\n My view is that if the opinion polls indicate a swing against the\n\nJLP, the PNP must interpret this as a definitive message from the electorate.\n I think people, repulsed by the antics of the JLP, want the\n\nopportunity to register a protest.\n Will the PNP afford them this opportunity by calling General\n\nElections soon? \n\n \n\n  PNP insiders are criticising Patterson for not being\n\nMachiavellian ( read power- hungry) enough.\n ( Thank God for that).\n They fear that he might be throwing away a glorious opportunity to\n\nretain his Party in Government.\n After all, the political playing field is always a treacherous and\n\nprecarious one.\n Conditions could change or be manipulated overnight.\n The countervailing view within the PNP is that the Government should\n\ncontest an election on the merit and success of its programmes, not on the\n\nweakness of its foe.\n Noble.\n\n\n  Another reason for calling elections in the near future is that,\n\nin my view, the ruling party needs a mandate ( ratification) from the\n\npopulace for the radical economic reforms implemented.\n Before the Government takes us any further down the road of\n\nliberalization it should renew its mandate.\n The Government should perhaps wait until it implements the political/\n\nadministrative reforms suggested by the Nettleford Commission, then bring a\n\npackage of politico-economic reforms to the electorate for ratification. \n\n  There is also the necessity for the Prime Minister to seek his\n\nown mandate from the electorate as soon as possible.\n Although there is no constitutionally derived urgency, there is a\n\nmoral one.\n Patterson came to the post of Prime Minister bruised and battered by\n\na media created monster called  " The Shell Waiver Scandal"  .\n It is, therefore, morally imperative to seek his own mandate soon.\n It is important though that the populace gets to know enough about\n\nhim in the role of chief executive in order to make a fair assessment at the\n\npolls.\n Patterson has been carrying out his promise made on his inauguration\n\nto meet the people.\n He has been an accessible Prime Minister, and for this he must be\n\ncommended. \n\n  However, Mr. Patterson must also be seen as an effective Chief\n\nExecutive.\n Several of his ministers especially, Bobby Pickersgill ( Minister of\n\nPublic Utilities & Transport) and Easton Douglas ( Minister of Health) are\n\neither not pulling their weight or are not effectively deployed.\n Pickersgill has failed to produce an effective public transport\n\nsystem after 3 1/2 years in office.\n On the other hand we can\'t pinpoint a single area of improvement\n\nwithin the    beleaguered   health sector\n\nafter 3 1/2 years.\n In Local Government the Government is failing miserably to keep the\n\nstreets or urban centres clean, signally a return to the  " dirty days\n\nof the seventies"  .\n These are issues that the Prime Minister must address now if he is to\n\nachieve success at the polls within six months or in 1994! \n\n  If any inference is to be drawn from the Government\'s recent\n\nretreat it is that a timetable has been set for the holding of General\n\nElections.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  " Jamaica - last\n\nplace to take a vacation"  was Robert Stephens, the Director of\n\nTourism.\n This was most disingenuous of him, since he was sitting on top of an\n\nofficial assessment of the Jamaican tourism product which was far worse than\n\nmine. \n\n  In 1990 the Jamaican Government commissioned Shirley Fletcher to\n\nsurvey and report on the state of the tourism product.\n Over 24 days, 146 persons in Kingston, Port Antonio, Ocho Rios,\n\nMontego Bay and Negril contributed views, perspectives and statistical data,\n\nand 12 project documents were considered. \n\n  " &dotted-line;no\n\nclearly articulated vision for tourism development,"  and that\n\n " ( hotel) accommodation has outstripped the provision of\n\ninfrastructure services, in particular, sewage and telephone"  .\n It also found that people from all over the island had descended in\n\ntheir tens of thousands on the  " boom"  towns in search of\n\nemployment.\n " growth of an\n\ninformal labour market primarily consisting of legal and illegal\n\ngoods&dotted-line; with the result that the very prosperity that attracted\n\nthe poor is now threatened by them."  \n\n  There are over 6,000 squatters in Ocho Rios. Squatters on the\n\nBelmont Property above Dunn\'s River Falls use the river as a sanitary\n\nfacility.\n The White River is polluted with fecal matter yet tourist rafting\n\ncontinues there. \n\n  Hotels in Negril and Montego Bay dump their raw sewage over the\n\nfence.\n Pipes connected to toilets in tourist villas in the West End of\n\nNegril empty directly into the sea.\n The location and nature of the sewage disposal system erected by the\n\nUrban Development Corporation at Seacastles has  "\n\n&dotted-line;infuriated local residents who have termed the system \'Doodo\n\nPark\'."  \n\n  have squatted\n\nbehind the new police station in Negril.\n There are no medical facilities in the resort, and public sanitary\n\nfacilities range from inadequate to non-existent.\n The result of squatting in north coast resort towns has been rising\n\ncrime rates, steep rises in the cost of living and a proliferation of illegal\n\ndrugs. \n\n \n\n  The misrepresentation of tours such as the Brimmer Hall\n\nPlantation tour and rafting on the Martha Brae and White Rivers is another\n\nproblem.\n The tours are cut by as much as 50% as tour operators rush back to\n\npick up another load of tourists.\n The Report also describes the slow processing of tourists at our two\n\ninternational airports as  " institutionalized harassment for\n\nunsuspecting foreigners"  .\n Even the Water Sports Operations are in the business of hiring touts\n\nto harass the tourists. \n\n  It also refers to a payola system in Ocho Rios where Indian In\n\nBond merchants pay a fee per head to taxi-drivers for each passenger coming\n\noff a cruise ship who visits their stores.\n It says that craft vendors and other shop owners harass the few\n\ntourists who are left. Anger and resentment is growing between the two\n\nfactions.\n There are seven craft markets in Ocho Rios with 600 vendors, and 13\n\nshopping centres with another mammoth and controversial one in the planning.\n There is little social infrastructure to support this.\n Housing and hospital services are inadequate; there is poor sewage\n\nand a high level of bacteria off Turtle Beach causing swimmers to get rashes.\n There is no sanitation in the Ocho Rios food market, and it must be\n\nremoved because it contributes to the squalor of the town. \n\n  In August 1990 there were 50 hotels on the northcoast, all\n\nmembers of the Jamaica Hotel and Tourist Association, that were operating\n\nwithout Health Certificates, and eight without licences.\n The Report also found that JUTA members ( ground transportation) are\n\nawarded the JTB Seal of Approval regardless of performance.\n Furthermore 40 hotels ( JHTA members) were in violation of Copyright\n\nLaws for the performance of music.\n Significantly the majority of squatters in resort communities are on\n\nland owned by Government and vested in the UDC and Commissioner of Lands.\n " the\n\nGovernment is legitimizing lawlessness."  \n\n  Government therefore has a job of work to do that it is seriously\n\nneglecting.\n Tourism is the country\'s number one foreign exchange earner and in\n\n1989 brought in US$600 million, employed 17,000 Jamaicans directly and\n\nanother 34,000 indirectly.\n The industry pays over US$200 million in taxes every year, and\n\nsuccessive governments seem unwilling to spend a single cent of that money in\n\nresorts where it is generated. \n\n \n\n \n " Government has a specific role to play in the management of the\n\ntourism product, and businesses that benefit have &dotted- line;clear\n\nresponsibility to devise initiatives that lead to the improvement of quality\n\nof life for tourists and for the resident population."  \n\n  Ocho Rios had nine police vehicles in 1970 and in 1990 it had 3\n\n1/2.\n Fern Gully is rapidly becoming a ghetto as vendors are being\n\npermitted to capture it.\n Government has a regulatory function in tourism that it is failing to\n\nperform.\n\n\n  I don\'t believe that we can ever get rid of the poor, drugs,\n\nprostitution and crime.\n But we can at least zone it.\n Every tourist resort in the world has its pushers, but they don\'t\n\ncome barefoot and ragged out of the hills trying to sell directly to tourists\n\non Main Street as happens here.\n where it is a little\n\nrougher and everybody knows they can get sex and drugs. \n\n  Nor is there any getting away from the fact that many tourists\n\ncame here for sex and drugs.\n The problem is that because these activities aren\'t zoned, tourists\n\nare more likely to end up dead in the search.\n Management of the tourism product means not only more functioning\n\npolice vehicles and manpower in the resorts, and radio control between the\n\nvillas, but a very clear sense of what kind of social behaviour is acceptable\n\nwhere. \n\n  What we need, as a friend of mine said at lunch recently, is a\n\nkind of Front Street and Back Street concept of tourism development.\n We have to move trashy natives and trashy tourists off the Front\n\nStreet and unto the Back Street.\n That way people who don\'t want to be harassed can walk down Front\n\nStreet, and the others who enjoy it can head for Back Street.\n\n\n, because that is the only way that the resort is going to be permitted to\n\nmaintain the elegance of its hotels, restaurants, beaches and promenades.\n\n\n\n  Tourism is in crisis today because of a lack of Government\n\nforesight and courage.\n Arrivals are up and receipts are down.\n The UDC cannot permit 80 squatter families in Belmont to foul Dunn\'s\n\nRiver, and ought not to continue acting as host to the degradation of every\n\nresort.\n Government agencies responsible for regulating the industry must do\n\nwhat they are paid to do, and work to amend legislation if necessary.\n The problem in this foreign exchange sector can hardly be one of the\n\nmoney, and must be one of imagination. \n\n  It may be, however, that our tourism planners exemplified by\n\nDirector Bobby Stephens, prefer to bury their heads in the sand.\n Since the sand is being removed from the beaches for construction\n\npurposes anyway, it is inevitable that they shall all shortly be exposed.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '86539388-b5e5-43b9-a4bb-a3b47af6c6ad', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.495586+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9708229303359985, 'non_english_score': 0.029177069664001465}

He said,\n \'I told you I was coming to get you& bring a wrap or a\n\njacket, we\'re going for a drive up into the hills.\'  \n\n  She liked going up into the hills& the higher you climbed, the\n\nmore the vegetation became interesting: all sorts of temperate-looking\n\nflowers in muted colours, feathery inflorescence and insects not seen\n\nbelow where it was too hot for them to live.\n Once she\'d been buzzed by an iridescent green bug with\n\ncellophane-like wings piped in darker green so the wings looked like window\n\npanes.\n Driving up into the hills it got cooler the higher you went, and you\n\ncould almost imagine you were going for a drive in some foreign country& like\n\nyou were in a novel,  \' &and towards evening they drove into an inn\n\nfor supper\'.  \n\n  Once they were seated in the big car with the real-leather\n\nupholstered seats, he began to talk.\n He talked as if he had stored up everything he had to tell her for a\n\nlong time, like he was just waiting to see her, to press his release button&\n\nshe realized that all she had to do was to sit there and maybe say mmmmm\n\nevery now and again. \n\n  Once she realized this, she did what she could do so well.\n She slipped out of herself and hoisted herself up on to the roof of\n\nthe car.\n It was a great advance view from up there.\n She could see way ahead of him into the oncoming distance, see the\n\nscoops in the road& the rises approaching and into the rooms of houses; also\n\nthe wind filled her hair like many whispers and she laughed out loud and\n\nrolled from side to side every time the car dipped into a hollow.\n She thought about sitting right up on the front of the bonnet, right\n\nwhere the silver emblem rode flagship on the front of the bonnet& it was at\n\nbest a peace symbol within a circle, but peace should go with freedom and\n\nought not be contained in a circle.\n She decided she was better off upon the roof.\n Eventually it was time to go back into herself, so she wiggled\n\ncarefully through the window and re-entered, just in time, for he said just\n\nthen& finally&\n\n She smiled.\n He took that for an answer and then he continued,\n \'Anyway, there is a farm up ahead, I\'ve put in two hundred\n\nacres and I\'m hoping to buy eighty more.\' \n The big car cleared the gateway and hummed to a stop inside the yard.\n There were about ten men standing in the driveway waiting for him.\n They all greeted him by crowding around the car and repeating his\n\nname over and over.\n right before\n\nher eyes& a big landowner.\n He used a different tone when he spoke to the workers.\n He was firm and authoritative and was something of a bully.\n He didn\'t introduce her, and she stood slightly apart from him\n\nwondering what to do with herself.\n She decided to sit on an ornate white garden bench out in the yard\n\nand from there to slip out of herself and go walking around the garden.\n She turned the corner away from where he was asking the workers about\n\nthe progress of the money trees.\n\n\n\n She noticed a pregnant cat lying on its side under an azalea bush.\n The cat was resting like a fallen-from-grace beauty queen& her belly\n\nhigh with kittens.\n It was a touching and lovely sight but what was more exciting was\n\nthat the azalea bush, shading the cat, was not alone. \n\n  It was part of a whole hedge.\n As a matter of fact, the entire yard was bordered by azalea bushes.\n\nCan you imagine how glorious that was going to be when they bloomed?\n There are few things lovelier than azaleas in a clay pot shimmering.\n He couldn\'t be so bad after all if he had the good taste to have a\n\nyard bordered by azaleas. \n\n  She felt that it was time to return.\n She was right, for as she got back to herself he said,\n \'It\'s a good thing you are such a dreamer& you can wait for\n\nlong periods of time on other people while you dream.\' \n She smiled.\n He said,\n\n She followed him as he took her on a tour of a house which was\n\ndecorated just right ( for some people).\n But she kept looking around for some spare love lying accidentally\n\nsomewhere, a kiss left languidly on a smooth surface.\n Some spare love.\n She didn\'t see any.\n And then there was this magnificent candle holder containing clean\n\ncandles.\n And she couldn\'t help herself, she said,\n \'I like candles which have burnt& you know?\n\n\n\n  They sit in the living-room, there is a fire-place and she sits\n\nclose to it& her seat is also near the door. \n\n  He sits or rather half-lies across a couch, the

says,\n\n So she lets him speak.\n He explains that he finds himself thinking about her a lot at the\n\nmost inconvenient times and things she says linger in his mind long after she\n\nhas said them.\n \'something\n\nlike this\'  but he wants it.\n He is an important person, he can afford a lot of things: take this\n\nmoney farm for example, he plans to buy eighty acres of land adjoining and\n\nput in more and more cash suckers and notebuds,\n She looks sleepy.\n He quickly says,\n\n He says he knows he can\'t buy something like what he feels with her&\n\nfor her&\n He knows, but right now, is there anything that she needs?\n Can he get her anything?\n And she says,\n\n And he says\n\n And she says,\n \'Do you know that your whole yard is bordered by an azalea\n\nhedge?\n That\'s wonderful!\n And maybe when they bloom, you could bring me some azaleas, you know&\n\nlike a lot of them.\n\n\n  He said,\n \'What the hell do you mean?\n I\'m trying to be serious, can\'t you be serious just once.\n You drive a ten-year-old car and you live in a flat which is very\n\ncharming but you don\'t own it and it might fall on your head soon and you are\n\nasking me for azaleas?\'  \n\n  She says,\n\n\n  He gets really angry.\n He says,\n\n She says,\n \'You probably do.\n Now can you take me home?\n\n\n  On the way down, he drives very fast so she thinks it\'s not wise\n\nto go outside and sit on the bonnet, he turns the radio on and they are\n\nplaying some really anonymous music.\n Usually she can identify songs like ten songs back after they\'ve been\n\nplayed, this time she can\'t remember which song went before the white bread\n\ntype one that was now playing..\n\n\n  She had hoped he would have stopped and cut some of the\n\ntemperate looking flowers for her to take home.\n He does not.\n She thinks maybe she will just go home and bathe with a soap called\n\n White Flowers  & it smelled exactly like mountain flowers and it\n\nwould balance out the smell of the notebuds and his anger.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  Do you know that there is a connection between lovers\n\nand Chinese food?\' \n \'I can\'t believe this woman\'\n\n look.\n\n \'Yes, it\'s true.\n I\'ve never been to a Chinese restaurant where there wasn\'t at least\n\none pair of lovers somewhere in a corner eating while they ate each other\n\nwith their eyes.\n Also, you can tell what is the state of the relationship by how they\n\neat and how much they eat.\'  \n\n  He looks across at her and he can\'t help himself, but he is\n\nslightly annoyed.\n Her vagueness, her far-out ideas which he finds so endearing\n\nsometimes annoy him slightly, now.\n Sometimes, it\'s like she goes off on an ethereal journey and he is\n\nangry because he cannot go all the way with her.\n Like this lovers and Chinese food theory, it\'s interesting but he\n\ndoesn\'t enter fully into it right away.\n Sometimes he misses the sensible down-to- earthness of the familiar\n\nwoman. \n\n  If he were with her, they would probably be talking about ways\n\nto make money or they\'d be discussing something that they had both read in\n\ntoday\'s newspaper.\n Sometimes it became very necessary to be around her, her familiarity\n\nwas so reassuring; but the flip side of that was dull. \n\n  Moon ( that was their private name for her), Moon, because she\n\nliked silvery things and her face was round and there were strong tides of\n\nfeelings always flowing through her, Moon was something rare.\n He balanced both women skilfully, he thought, sometimes he was\n\noverawed at the amount of riches he possessed in them collectively. \n\n  Moon is smiling now, she bends over and is whispering to him,\n \'Look over there in that corner, do you see that couple?\'\n\n\n He glances over and in the corner there is a man in his early\n\nfifties, looking like a business executive.\n He is with a slender young girl who looks like she could have\n\nrecently joined his firm as a trainee in the marketing department. \n\n  The man is ordering from the menu in a confident and experienced\n\nway; the girl looks nervous but she is obviously also quite thrilled.\n The man is in charge, he says to the girl,\n \'I\'m sure you will like the Mushrooms in Oyster Sauce, trust\n\nme.\' \n The girl nods and says,\n\n\n  The man is speaking a little too loudly, for his last remark\n\nhangs in the air, right up there with the fringed red paper lanterns.\n In spite of himself, David was drawn into the unfolding of the\n\nLovers and Chinese Food Theory. \n\n  says Moon,\n \'that\'s the early stages.\n They haven\'t been to bed together yet, the girl is not sure that she\n\nshould, but she is responding favourably to his bold, masterful  "\n\ntake charge"  attitude, she probably will give him her body, and\n\nthat\'s the stage the relationship is at.\n Now later when they are lovers they won\'t take so much time\n\nordering, they will have favourites by then.\'  \n\n  Then she said,\n\n ( That\'s another thing about Moon, she resisted all rules,\n\ngrammatically and otherwise.)\n David was such an organized businesslike type, he hardly ever used\n\nslang.\n He is unprepared for the question.\n he asks her.\n says\n\nMoon.\n He finds her very endearing right now, she is very exotic looking,\n\nsort of Rasta Chic.\n Sometimes she was so otherworldly, he wonders if he could live with\n\nher every day, it would probably be like drinking champagne in the morning or\n\neating lobster every Monday.\n Sometimes he saved her up, like he used to relish some particularly\n\nnice treat as a child; don\'t eat it right away, save it for a day or two then\n\ngo to it with all your strength.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '734406fa-0482-44ed-ac5a-2a838515a5a4', 'added':

{'text': "There was an old slave who was no longer of any use on the\n\nplantation and was left to fend for himself.\n In those days there was nobody more useless than an old man, an old\n\nwoman could at least look after children, but a man who was no longer strong\n\nenough to work in the canefield or the sugar mill was no use.\n He cost more to feed than he could contribute, so he was set loose to\n\nmake do any way he could. \n\n  At first some of the other slaves shared their food with him, but\n\nsince they hardly had enough for themselves, this didn't go very far.\n Besides, the old man felt guilty accepting food from people who had to\n\nwork so hard.\n So he began spending a lot of time wandering through the bushes and\n\nliving off such fruits and roots as he could find.\n Since he was old and shaky and couldn't do much walking, sometimes he\n\nwould spend long hours just sitting in the sun and warming himself.\n After a while he began spending all his time in the bushes not\n\nwanting to be a burden to anyone.\n People on the plantation began to forget him.\n His body withered until he was almost all skin and bones.\n Slaves were sold to other plantations and new slaves were bought.\n Many of those who once knew him thought he was dead, and when people\n\nsaw him in the bushes they thought they were seeing a ghost.\n The story developed that there was a skin-and-bone ghost who lived in\n\nthe bushes.\n\n\n  Many strange things can happen to an old slave dying in the\n\nbushes.\n Dry Bones heard familiar voices in his dreams instructing him to\n\nprepare his soul for his return to his home in Africa.\n The voices said his soul must be completely transformed into the form\n\nof a bird.\n\n\n  One day a slave boy was walking in the bushes and he saw this\n\nhuge white bird perched on the top of a tree with its wings outstretched\n\nwarming itself in the sun.\n He took out his sling shot, loaded it, aimed for the bird's head and\n\nfired.\n The bird fell, bouncing from branch to branch, and finally landed on\n\na guava tree where it rested with its head hanging down.\n The boy rushes to the tree and shook it until the bird fell to the\n\nground.\n He noticed that the bird fell very lightly, almost without sound, and\n\nwhen he picked it up he was surprised to find that, in spite of its size, it\n\nwas very light, almost weightless.\n Nevertheless he shoved the bird into the crocus bag he was carrying,\n\nslung it over his shoulder and began walking home. \n\n  As he walked along he noticed that the bag kept getting heavier\n\nand heavier, and bulges began forming in it.\n Then he felt hard things rubbing against his back and sharp points\n\nsinking into his shoulders.\n Quickly he threw down the bag.\n He heard a moan as the bag hit the ground, and he saw different parts\n\nof it sticking out as if something was turning over inside; the thing was\n\nquite big now, almost filling the bag.\n The boy was terrified and he turned and ran away as fast as he could.\n As he ran he kept repeating,\n\n When he got to a crossroads he marked an X in the middle of the\n\nroad and continued running home to tell his mother what he had seen. \n\n  A few weeks later the slave master and one of his slaves went\n\nbird shooting. The master carried his gun slung over his shoulder and the\n\nslave walked behind him carrying a bag in which he put the birds the master\n\nshot.\n They got to a tree and saw a huge white bird sitting at the top with\n\noutstretched wings warming itself in the sun.\n\n\n  said the slave.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  The master chuckled.\n\n\n  He aimed and fired.\n The bird fell, bouncing from branch to branch, and finally landed on\n\na guava tree where it rested with its head hanging down.\n The master rushed to the tree and shook it until the bird fell to the\n\nground.\n The slave noticed that it fell very lightly, almost without sound.\n\n\n\n \n\n  said the slave, his eyes wide with\n\nfright. \n\n \n\n  The slave was trembling.\n\n\n  The master looked around for a stick.\n The slave dropped the bag of dead birds he was carrying and ran off\n\ninto the bushes crying. \n\n \n\n  Then he picked up the bird.\n It was a bit light for its size but was heavier than it had appeared\n\nfrom the way it had fallen.\n He put it in the bag, threw the bag over his shoulder and began\n\nclimbing the hill. \n\n  He had only gone a few yards when he felt the bag getting heavy.\n At first it was just because he wasn't accustomed to carrying loads\n\nand because the hill was a bit steep.\n But he soon felt the bulges forming, the hard things rubbing against\n\nhis back, and the sharp points sinking into his shoulders.\n He was about to drop the bag when he felt two bony hands fasten\n\naround his neck, and two bony legs gripping him around his waist.\n He cried out and tried to shake the thing off, but the weight kept\n\nincreasing. \n\n  he bawled out.\n\n\n  'When you picked me up, you picked up your troubles,'\n\n said Dry Bones. \n\n  the master panted.\n\n\n  He began to struggle again to get rid of Dry Bones.\n They fell to the ground and rolled over but Dry Bones held on.\n The dead birds from the bag were now strewn all over the grass.\n\n\n  'When you picked me up, you picked up your troubles!'\n\n repeated Dry Bones. \n\n  the master pleaded.\n\n\n\n \n\n  'But I can't walk with you on my back, you're too heavy.'\n\n \n\n \n\n  The weight lessened, and when the master turned around he saw the\n\nwhite bird standing in the grass and watching him.\n He picked up the dead birds and returned them to the bag; the white\n\nbird then slipped into the bag by himself.\n The master threw the bag over his shoulder, picked up his gun and\n\nbegan walking towards his home, not certain whether he was awake or dreaming.\n\n\n\n  After about a quarter of a mile he met his overseer on a horse.\n His overseer was his own son that he had had with one of the slave\n\nwomen. \n\n  said\n\nthe overseer. \n\n  'And I'm dog-tired, too.\n Why don't you help me carry them? You may have a few of them if you\n\nlike.'  \n\n  said the overseer,\n\n\n  The master gave him the bag.\n he said as he\n\nstarted walking in the opposite direction. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Then he felt the bulges forming, the hard things rubbing against\n\nhis back, and the sharp points sticking into his shoulders.\n Suddenly the bony hands gripped his neck and the pair of bony legs\n\nfolded around his waist.\n The overseer began struggling to free himself.\n With the increased weight and the struggle above him, the horse began\n\ngalloping. \n\n  cried the overseer.\n\n\n  'When you picked me up, you picked up your troubles,'\n\n said Dry Bones. \n\n  The horse was galloping faster now, and in their struggling\n\nthey lost their balance and fell to the ground.\n They rolled and tumbled in the road.\n The overseer began cursing a lot of bad words but Dry Bones\n\nwouldn't let go. \n\n  said the\n\noverseer. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  breathed the overseer.\n New sweat broke out all over his body and he trembled.\n 'You're Dry Bones the jumbie!\n Oh, let me go!\n\n\n  said\n\nDry Bones.\n\n\n  With his head bowed and tears rolling down his cheeks the\n\noverseer began walking toward his house with Dry Bones fastened to his back.\n\n\n\n  The overseer's wife didn't like the idea of her husband taking\n\nthis emaciated old man into their home and she showed her resentment openly.\n The overseer put Dry Bones in the storeroom and gave him food.\n He didn't tell his wife how he had come by Dry Bones because he felt\n\nsure she wouldn't believe him.\n She would think he was crazy.\n So he told her he found the old man in the bushes starving.\n In fact he was even afraid of mentioning it to his boss for fear of\n\nbeing laughed at and declared mad.\n The whole thing was like a bad dream and he kept hoping he would\n\nwake up and be rid of it.\n But the old man in the storeroom was real enough and had the\n\nappetite to prove it; he couldn't get enough to eat.\n He often complained of being cold, and at his request, the overseer\n\nput him in an armchair in the yard every morning so he could warm himself in\n\nthe sun.\n Flesh began to appear on his bones.\n The overseer was afraid to raise the question of the old man's\n\nmysterious appearance in the bird-shooting bag; it was as if he felt that by\n\nnot discussing it, it would simply go away.\n But there was no way he could just rationalize away the old man's\n\npresence in his house, for everytime Dry Bones looked at him the message in\n\nhis eyes was clear \x13\n\n\n\n\n  Finally the overseer decided he couldn't live with the strange\n\nsituation any longer.\n He had to discuss his problem with somebody.\n So late one night, after everybody in the house had gone to bed, he\n\ncrept quietly out of the house and went to seek the services of an obeah man.\n The obeah man lived alone in a little wattle-and-daub house beside a\n\nriver.\n There was a light in the house when the overseer got there.\n He knocked on the door and the obeah man opened it.\n He was jet black, had thick uncombed hair, and was stripped to the\n\nwaist.\n A small wooden carving of a grotesque head hung from the necklace of\n\nred cloth he had around his neck.\n In the middle of the floor a black candle burned surrounded by bones\n\nand various kinds of herbs.\n The obeah man told the overseer to sit on the other side of the\n\ncandle, and then he sat down facing him.\n\n\n  asked the obeah man.\n\n\n\n  The overseer shivered.\n\n\n  'But how you going to get rid of him unless you kill\n\nhim?'  \n\n \n\n  'If he was just an ordinary man I wouldn't mind too\n\nmuch,'  said the overseer,", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '0216b3cf-e6f5-4347-aa87-552948453b07', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.498161+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9941025972366333, 'non_english_score': 0.005897402763366699}

she sang; she intoned.\n In one register, in another; in one octave, then higher.\n Lyrically, with syncopation, with improvisations far, far out from\n\nher original composition.\n The changes were musical only.\n The lyrics never changed.\n 'Nine times three is twenty- seven.\n\n And then the wheeling, the turning, the bending, the scratching and\n\nthe moving on the heels.\n Revd Simpson did not even look outside of his window at Miss Gatha.\n And though the whole concert was a public event by now, it was with\n\nthe ears and the head that people saw it.\n They shooed the children back inside and closed the wooden windows\n\nfacing the road.\n Miss Gatha dancing.\n Miss Gatha talking.\n Miss Gatha warning.\n Man would feel.\n And that would be hard enough.\n Why watch too?\n Revd Simpson continued to dress for church.\n He had to.\n He was going.\n day for him.\n 'Dear Roger, the scripture moveth me and you in sundry\n\nplaces.' \n Not a single soul, except perhaps Mass Levi \x13 and he raised his\n\neyebrows to himself \x13 would be in church today.\n It was Miss Gatha's day.\n he said to himself and again to\n\nhimself,\n\n\n  The spirit moveth too in sundry places.\n Or perhaps Miss Gatha had called them.\n For by the time she started her dance back home, visitors had arrived\n\nfrom near and from afar and had occupied her tabernacle.\n They were men and women.\n All in dresses.\n White and red were the colours.\n Some wore a white dress with a red head- tie.\n Some a red dress with a white head-tie.\n Some a white dress with a white head- tie.\n And others a red dress with a red head-tie.\n The dress styles varied little but the nature of the head-tie, not at\n\nall.\n All with rabbit ears.\n All with pencils in the head-tie.\n All yellow and newly sharpened.\n Drums rolled, their bum-batti-bum-batti- bum-batti- bum, the next\n\nitem on the programme of music and recitation, that the Sunday morning\n\noffered to Grove Town's people now captives in their own homes.\n And when the cutting and the clearing was done, and the spirits had\n\nrecognized each other and Miss Gatha had been let into her tabernacle,\n\nsinging a hundred times louder than Miss Gatha's had been began.\n And the groaning.\n And the dancing of so many feet, stomping on the listener's\n\nmind. \n\n  Miss Gatha's solo had begun about 8 o'clock in the morning.\n It had caught Mass Levi in the latrine.\n He never left it.\n Nine times three is twenty- seven.\n Three times three times three.\n If she didn't change her style so much!\n If she would only keep one tune, he would be able to follow her and\n\nhold her.\n But that woman was slippery.\n And trying to catch her was taking away from his concentration and he\n\nneeded all his energy and particularly today since it was Sunday and it was\n\nthe 27th, three times three times three indeed.\n Dealing with her drained him.\n Now the bum-batti-bum- batti- bum-batti-bum was deafening him.\n He had to let go of the doll so he could use both his hands to push\n\nthe sound away from his ears.\n On came the groaning and the stomping, like a hundred men stepping on\n\nhis chest to cut off his breath and to force him into an asthmatic attack.\n He pulled his feet up to his chest to protect himself.\n A baby in the foetal position.\n His pants half-way down, his BVD grinning, his bottom in the circle\n\nof the latrine seat, his privates hanging down like a wet rat and his doll\n\nand his books scattered on the floor of the latrine.\n That was Mass Levi who could some time ago have tied a thief to a\n\ntree and said  'Root'  . He had not given up though.\n\n\nping his chest, with much determination though with little success. \n\n  The tabernacle didn't break for Sunday dinner.\n The drumming, the singing and the groaning continued straight through\n\nto nightfall.\n Anita had spent all her fifteen years in Grove Town but she had never\n\nbefore sat in on Miss Gatha's performance, though she had heard things.\n The Holnesses were strangers to the district.\n They had never seen Miss Gatha operate but they too had heard things.\n In any case, they had grown up and lived in areas similar to Grove\n\nTown so they knew that  'three times three times three'  and\n\nthe singing and the drumming and the groaning that held the district frozen\n\nin its grip had meaning.\n They too closed their doors and windows.\n Could it be that with the windows closed in the day \x13 for they were\n\nalways closed at nights \x13 Anita was being oxygen-starved?\n Eight o'clock had not come in that house without its usual\n\noccurrence but thanks to continued prayer, it had been less and less\n\ndreadful.\n Miss Gatha's solo had found that house in prayer and they had given\n\nthanks that the thing that usually pulled and pushed the two women in the\n\nhouse was barely felt that morning.\n Why with things going so well, should Anita now be putting her hands\n\nup to her ears, complaining that the noise from the tabernacle was  'suffocating'\n\n her?\n True the whole situation was packed with awe and dread but it was so\n\nfor everyone in the house this time and nobody else was taking it as hard as\n\nAnita, a child who had gone through so much and conquered.\n And it must have been bad indeed for her, for Teacher Holness just\n\nmanaged to catch her fainting form. \n\n  Fainting was one thing.\n They could fan her and rub her up with smelling salts.\n And they did.\n But what to do when the child's face changed to that of an old woman\n\nand she began in her stupor to moan and groan like Miss Gatha and her\n\ncompanions at the tabernacle?\n Where Miss Gatha herself had fallen on the ground; where they had\n\npinned her dress between her legs; where she was thrashing, boxing and\n\nkicking and screaming what seemed like\n ; where her face had changed to that of\n\na beautiful fifteen-year-old and back again to that of a woman of Miss\n\nGatha's sixty odd years and back again and back again and back again until\n\nshe was silent, her limbs quiet and she was fifteen years old.\n In the Tabernacle there was no consternation at these changes.\n There, there was instead joy:\n ,\n ,\n\n There, water mother, full in white, lifted the whistle from her belt\n\nand with its cord still joined to her waistband, moved it to her lips and\n\nblew one long, sharp report.\n All jumping, singing, drumming and groaning ceased and everyone,\n\nincluding water mother herself, froze.\n She blew again, said softly\n and with that all took what they\n\nhad and left Miss Gatha's form with its fifteen-year-old face on the ground.\n\n\n\n  It wasn't strange that Mass Levi should spend the whole day in\n\nthe privy.\n He had given up breakfast and, along with it, the company of his\n\nwife and young son.\n He had quite a while now been giving this time to his books, his\n\nprayers and the privy.\n Normally on a Sunday morning though, he would get out and prepare\n\nhimself for the 11 o'clock service.\n But even he in his solitary world must hear the singing and the\n\ndrumming and know that this was a Miss Gatha day and that there would be no\n\nchurch.\n So it wasn't strange to Miss Iris that he should let 11 o'clock too\n\nfind him in the privy.\n He did usually eat Sunday dinner.\n But since this was not to be a church day, he could have decided to\n\nmake it a whole day fast.\n He had had those too.\n And since he had stopped speaking to anybody or answering their\n\nquestions, he could be having a whole day fast right there with his books in\n\nthe privy without letting on to anyone.\n Miss Iris was not at that time studying what Mass Levi was doing in\n\nthe latrine: she was far too vexed for that.\n She was thinking how unreasonable the man had become.\n How could he sit there all day and expect his wife and son to do\n\ntheir business in a chamber pot or behind a tree somewhere?\n\n\n  It was the young girl's scream in the privy that made her\n\nconsider what was going on with him.\n She knew that she distinctly heard a scream and wasn't sure but she\n\nthought she heard the words,\n\n She thought too that she had heard scuffling like someone was\n\npulling themselves away and like someone had hit someone down.\n Those loud-mouthed chocolate leaves were in the way.\n Pulling herself up like a ballet dancer, she tip-toed through them\n\nto the side of the latrine and listened.\n Nothing.\n But she was quite sure she had heard something.\n Not even the sound of a man clearing his throat or turning a page\n\nnow.\n She listened again and got bold: the man might be sleeping.\n She would dare.\n She would peep.\n But how to get to where the air vent was.\n The wash tub nearby gave her the answer.\n She tip-toed through the leaves again, helped it up on her head,\n\ntip-toed again, turned the tub upon its face and stepped up.\n It was the dolly baby that struck her most.\n What Levi make dolly baby for? Miss Iris couldn't imagine her\n\nsuperior husband asking anyone to make a thing like that for him, so he had\n\nto have made it himself.\n And she didn't even know the man could make image!\n Then she noticed his position.\n No normal man could sit in that position and so quiet.\n No normal man wouldn't by now feel somebody staring at him and\n\nshift.\n Something was definitely wrong.\n\n\n  It was still the doll that caused her most consternation when\n\nshe eventually opened the privy door.\n The face on the little thing looked exactly like Euphemia's\n\ndaughter's face.\n If it was Calvert who had that doll she could understand.\n She knew how the boy felt about that child.\n But the father!", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'a69b4946-bec2-4ebc-bfee-f37260d17f64', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.499335+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9942711591720581, 'non_english_score': 0.0057288408279418945}

perform.\n A brilliant concert pianist she was, and he was manager of the host\n\ncompany.\n No one seemed to know exactly what happened but there had been a\n\ncocktail party the night before she was due to leave.\n He left the party with her.\n That wasn't strange.\n Someone would have had to take her back to the hotel.\n What was strange was that she didn't leave the next day not the next.\n Eventually there was a week in a beach cottage and finally the\n\napartment for all these years. \n\n  You know how rumour spreads in a small place.\n Even the words she is supposed to have said to her husband,\n sounded so\n\ntrite.\n In any case who would have heard her say them?\n It just takes one person to start a story and get it going.\n\n\n  It wasn't the first time he was seeing her.\n Years earlier they had met when he had taken a troupe to her country.\n He had heard her sing then.\n He had never heard anyone sing like that\n Afterwards he was introduced to her.\n He was entirely taken by her elegance and her humility.\n It didn't matter that people said he was monopolizing her.\n Forever after he was to hear her voice saying,\n 'I hate to meet people like ships& passing, you know.'\n\n\n And years after, he kept wishing he had told her then that she didn't\n\nhave to be a ship to him. \n\n  He had heard that she was married.\n Happily married to a man much her senior, who doted on her.\n At least so they said.\n So let it be.\n When he heard she was coming to Regina it was hard to contain his\n\nexcitement.\n He kept wondering if she would remember him.\n\n\n  As soon as he knew she had seen the schedule he phoned the hotel\n\nto ask her to dine with him, alone, the night before her departure.\n There was no other time so tight was the schedule.\n And he had felt his heart stop when she piped into the phone.\n If anyone had told him these things could happen to a grown man he\n\nwould have said no. \n\n  'I had always hoped we would meet again& and not like\n\nships,'  he had said when he finally got close to her.\n He felt a little corny repeating her own not original words but her\n\nface lit up and she squeezed his generous hand with her small one and\n\nlaughed.\n\n\n  Talking to her over dinner had been like talking to a long time\n\nfriend.\n They seemed to have shared so much, although they had never really\n\nmet in the true sense.\n There were so many gatherings he had been in that she must have been\n\na part of.\n They had shared the same world of music and of art in the metropolis\n\nthat many years earlier.\n He had not been so at ease in anyone's company nor felt so\n\nexhilarated by interaction as long as he could remember. \n\n  He had asked her if she positively had to leave the next day and\n\nshe confessed that she wasn't going home but to another island for a week by\n\nherself to recharge.\n Boldly he had suggested that she give him/them the week.\n He already envisioned himself taking the week off, renting a beach\n\ncottage& \n\n  She was not sure why she kept saying yes, but this experience was\n\nsomething she didn't want to end.\n What harm could come to anyone if she went off with this man for the\n\nweek?\n She had planned to take the time anyway.\n She would phone home and say she had decided to change the venue of\n\nthe holiday.\n\n\n  After that, nothing was a lie.\n The two of them, the interaction, were suspended in space and time.\n Without discussing it they seemed both to have decided not to discuss\n\nfamily or job and just deal with the inside of each other's head.\n And there was a lot of driving about to places of geographical and\n\nhistorical interest, and a lot of swimming and simply hanging about.\n But most of all, a lot of talk.\n The relaxation was complete.\n The sense of not having to censure anything before you said it, the\n\nknowledge that no judgment was awaiting your little thoughts and actions&\n There is something about maturity that allows you to get to the\n\nessential so much faster than before. \n\n  She was attached to her husband and her children, not children\n\nanymore of course, everyone was adult and professional.\n She was sure her husband was glad she was his wife.\n\n\n  Living with this strange man was so comfortable, so unstressed,\n\nit must be a dream.\n But you can't judge by a week.\n That's just a holiday \x13 an unreal situation.\n Would he be the same considerate, undemanding person if he had to go\n\nto work every day?\n Would he want the house to be neat and tidy when he got home?\n Would her singing start to irritate him after a trying day at work?\n\n\n\n  She knew this was coming.\n She felt it a mile off.\n Would she consider another week?\n And she was saying yes, and wanting yes.\n After all there were three more weeks still before the school term\n\nstarted. \n\n  He would have to go to work.\n The firm couldn't do without him for more than a week.\n He moved some serious clothes into the flat, and some fat law books\n\nand papers.\n By now she knew he lived alone.\n With two marriages to his debit and two children both convinced\n\ntheir mothers had been wronged. \n\n \n\n  The coming together when it happened was so easy, it frightened\n\nher.\n She had expected it to be traumatic.\n She was ashamed of her personal statistics \x13 the same man before and\n\nafter marriage.\n A friend of hers had once said such a record was only fit to be\n\nbroken.\n She had decided beforehand that if that part didn't go as well as\n\nthe rest had, she would go back to her old life, but ask that they remain\n\nfriends.\n In any case nothing and nobody could touch what they had already\n\nshared. \n\n  How Aubrey took the whole thing surprised and saddened her.\n Perhaps it was even a little shattering to her pride.\n She had gone home and told him what she could.\n There seemed to be so little and so much to tell.\n Quite unexpectedly this meeting had happened.\n She appreciated his concern and even his affection over the years\n\nbut she could not give this up. \n\n  She took nothing from the house beside her music sheets, the\n\nflute she sometimes played and four miniatures from her favourite\n\npainter. \n\n  The community of artists received her like a long lost sister,\n She got a job teaching voice and piano just as she had at home and\n\nnobody seemed upset by her personal arrangement.\n She was not divorced.\n She would never be.\n She couldn't ask that of Aubrey.\n He wasn't even just any Catholic.\n\n\n  She started to compose again \x13 a thing she hadn't done in years.\n Living in this unhurried way with somebody who was on the same\n\nwavelength as herself was something else.\n And the Great River there, constantly giving itself to the sea\n\nyet not losing itself, was an inspiration to her. \n\n  The third year of the union she planned an extended holiday,\n\nvisiting husband and children family and old friends, those who would have\n\nher.\n She had expected the friends to shun her, treat her like a scarlet\n\nwoman.\n She had been pleasantly surprised.\n There was no censure just open admiration for how well she looked\n\nand what fine work she had been producing. \n\n  the\n\nleast tactful of them said. \n\n  'Fowl come scratch it up.\n Well God bless music.\n\n\n\n  It was in the summer of ' 85 that she first felt the lump.\n In fact it was he who had found it and told her to go to the\n\ndoctors.\n\n\n  She hadn't started to be really sick immediately.\n Give thanks for that.\n Such a fruitful summer.\n The best selections for the Christmas concert had come from those\n\npieces.\n\n\n  Mr Strom came at the same time every day.\n Regular like clockwork.\n Late afternoon and stayed into the evening.\n He would stare at her through the crack.\n At her face, now narrow like a spoon.\n Just bone really.\n Good bone.\n The structure was good.\n His imagination could put back the rest.\n She didn't want him to see.\n How vain she was!\n Or perhaps she just didn't want to have to watch the grief on his\n\nface.\n He felt gratified that she had chosen to stay and die in Regina.\n\n\n  With her head in the corner and her eyes closed she could hear\n\nhim open the gate and stride jauntily into the flat whistling that old\n\nfavourite:", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM',

{'text': "Four months after Jesse left for Kingston to find a husband, Ma\n\nLou's grandson Devonshire came home from Col&oacute;n.\n Strutted in, was more like it.\n He arrived in fullblown Col&oacute;n style \x13 a brown draped suit\n\ncomplete with watch chain with dangling charms and a fat gold watch inside\n\nhis fob pocket, matching brown derby, yellow boots, and a walking stick with\n\nthe head of a wolf carved in ivory on the handle.\n Mama laughed\n\nwhen trailing the sweet smell of brillantine he came into the bedroom to pay\n\nhis respects to her the minute he arrived.\n\n\n  Dev didn't see Brid when he came for she shot out of sight as soon\n\nas she saw him approaching across the yard, but she had a good look at him;\n\nBrid was good at seeing through cracks in walls and half-pulled shutters,\n\nfrom behind closed doors and between floorboards.\n\n\n  'and little\n\nBridget?'  \n\n  'Jesse is gone away my dear, gone to Kingston to stay\n\nwith her Aunt Irene.\n Four months now she's gone and left us.\n Brid is still around though by now she's grown out of your sight,\n\nDev. Just me and Brid left. And Ma Lou.'  \n\n  her mother called in her weak, pale\n\nvoice.\n 'Bridget.\n\n\n  Ma Lou yelled in her loud\n\nmarketwoman's voice. \n\n  But Brid who was peering through a crack into Mama's room didn't\n\nanswer.\n She held her breath so they wouldn't hear her and marvelled at Dev.\n How handsome he had become.\n He had grown almost a foot taller in the five years he was gone, and\n\nhad filled out.\n Looked like a real grown up man.\n Dev was hardly much older than she was now when he left home.\n A real langillala skinny-foot boy he was.\n And look at him now.\n Brid was pleased to see Dev, for he'd been the closest thing she had\n\nto a brother.\n In the past she could always rely on him to play games with her, pick\n\nmangoes from the tallest branches or knock down the ripe soursops; he would\n\ndry her tears when she cried and frighten her with tales of duppies and\n\nBlackartman.\n But she wouldn't come out and talk to him because she was dismayed to\n\nsee the old Dev vanish and this impressive, self- assured stranger in his\n\nplace.\n It was as if Dev too had let her down.\n His coming instead of making her feel happy as she had imagined, just\n\nmade her feel more ashamed.\n Ashamed of herself, her unfashionable hair and hand-me-down clothes,\n\nashamed of the old house with the rotting verandah and falling shingles and\n\npeeling woodwork, ashamed of her mother who was perpetually ill, the smell of\n\nthe sick-room, damp and decay, ashamed of their poverty and their pride.\n Or rather, Mama and Jesse's pride, for she had none, or so they told\n\nher. \n\n  Ma Lou wasn't too impressed by Dev \x13 she didn't want a sweet-man\n\nfor a grandson.\n She felt better when after a few weeks of walking up and down the\n\nwhole district to show off his clothes, his Panama strut, his American accent\n\nand his Panama gold rings \x13 like all the other young men who came back from\n\nforeign \x13 Dev took off his good clothes and his jewellery, put on a pair of\n\nAmerican denim overalls and one of his old shirts and went into the garden\n\nwith his machete.\n Ma Lou could understand, for fly high, fly low,\n\nshe said after Dev left to get work on building the Panama Canal, there was\n\nnothing to beat working on the land.\n But Dev didn't really go into the garden to work; he just wanted to\n\nget into the feel of things again, to rid himself of the dust and the sound\n\nof dynamite blasting in his ears, the American straw-boss yelling and rain\n\nand the smell of damp clothes and mildew and dead things rotting in the\n\nstreets. \n\n  Ma Lou confided\n\nto Mama, as she sponged her body down and turned her in the bed.\n 'Want to put him money into land.\n And house.\n she said with\n\nsatisfaction, as if she had done the screwing, for she believed that whatever\n\nsense Dev showed in managing his affairs it was she who had beaten it into\n\nhim.\n Dev's mother had come and placed him in her arms shortly after he was\n\nborn and was never heard from again.\n Dev's father, Ma Lou's son, died soon after, when a tree he was\n\nchopping down fell the wrong way.\n\n\n  'Maybe he could buy ours,' Mama said and laughed again,\n\nbut Brid listening on the other side of the wall knew it wasn't a genuine\n\nlaugh like the one she had greeted Dev with.\n This was the laugh of bitterness for Brid knew it pained her mother\n\nto see what she and her family had come to, while people like Dev whom they\n\nwould never have counted in the old days, were now moving up in the world.\n Brid knew because it was all her mother used to talk about to Jesse.\n\n\n\n  Brid couldn't understand how Mama and Jesse could be so proud of\n\ntheir white skin when so far as she could see, there were no advantages to be\n\nderived from it.\n At school, it is true, the big girls would sit with their backs\n\nagainst the flying buttresses of the church ( the school was in the same\n\nyard) and during recess take turns endlessly combing and plaiting her hair,\n\npraising her to the skies for how beautiful it was and how wonderful it was\n\nto have good, tall hair.\n But then during class the boys sitting behind would thread her long\n\nplait through the hole for the inkwell in their desk and tie it into a knot.\n So clever were they that sometimes she wouldn't even realize what was\n\nhappening until the bell rang and she stood up and knocked the desk over,\n\nsending ink pots and slates flying while the bad boys dashed out of the\n\nschoolroom yelling with laughter and the other children shouted at her while\n\nshe cried with frustration trying to free herself from the desk.\n So what good was that?\n She saw no advantage to having fair skin because everyone around her\n\nwas black and she stood out, and she didn't want to stand out, didn't want\n\nthem to notice her, because then they would notice her poverty, her house\n\nfalling down, her bedridden mother.\n Everyone else around was poor too, ate turn cornmeal and shad just\n\nlike them, or worse; had houses ten times worse than theirs, without floors\n\neven, and had no nice furniture like they had \x13 the pieces that hadn't yet\n\nbeen sold.\n But that was different.\n 'nobody\n\nexpects any better of them.'  \n\n  Brid asked Jesse in\n\ntheir room that night. \n\n  Jesse said.\n 'We're only poor because Papa ran away and left us and there\n\nwas nobody to look after the place after that.\n\n\n  Brid knew this by heart; she had heard it many times before.\n So why didn't they just accept their lot in life and stop behaving as\n\nif they were better than everybody else, she asked. \n\n \n\nJesse said.\n 'God gave you beautiful skin and long lovely hair and you\n\nshould thank him for it and take care of it.\n Someday a man will come along who will appreciate those things and\n\nyou'll be glad then that you don't have ol'nayga skin and picky-picky hair.'\n\n \n\n  That's all Jesse lived for: for a man to come along.\n Meanwhile, she took good care of herself; rubbed cocoa butter into\n\nher skin every single night and brushed her hair a hundred times morning and\n\nevening.\n She used chewstick to clean her teeth every time she ate, rubbed\n\nannatto into her lips and cheeks and put charcoal on her lashes, washed her\n\nhair with aloe and rinsed it with rosemary, tried out a new hair style every\n\nday, twisting her head this way and that to see the effect in the tarnished\n\nthree-way vanity mirror, though nobody ever saw her except Brid and Mama and\n\nMa Lou. \n\n  When Jesse was twenty, she and Mama and Ma Lou realised that no\n\n<l> body would ever come along to notice her where they lived, since nobody\n\never came at all, so she was sent to Aunt Irene in Kingston. \n\n  Brid liked it when Jesse was around because then nobody made any\n\ndemands on her.\n Jesse was the one who helped Ma Lou with Mama in the sickroom, who\n\nwent and spent her time talking and reading to her.\n Brid hated going into the room, hated the smell, the way her mother\n\nlooked, her querulous complaints.\n She never went in if she could help it.\n Now that she no longer went to school, she preferred to spend her\n\ntime helping Ma Lou in the garden or the kitchen, places where Jesse hated to\n\nbe. \n\n  When Dev left, there was no man to help them, except for Mass Ron\n\nwho came to do the hard work as needed, like digging the yam hills and\n\nhelping to plant and stake the yams, doing the ploughing and cutting and\n\nburning.\n Mass Ron was hired to do these things when there was money, or for a\n\nshare of the crop, when there was none.\n When the land was cleared, Brid went out and helped Ma Lou with the\n\nplanting, or reaping the cocoa, picking the coffee, peeling the ginger, or\n\nshelling the corn. \n\n  It was Ma Lou who arranged for her friend Miss Gertie who was\n\nstill selling in the market to come and buy their crops.\n Without Ma Lou, Brid thought, they'd be nothing. Ma Lou lived in a\n\nlittle cottage at the back which Dev shared with her until he went away.\n Then Ma Lou came and lay down her bedding in the room beside Mama's\n\nand slept there every night.\n Ma Lou was born in the cottage because her parents used to work with\n\nMama's grandparents, and even after her parents died, Ma Lou just stayed on.\n When Mama was born, it was Ma Lou who looked after her and then she\n\nlooked after Mama's babies.\n Ma Lou had been with them all her life; it was unthinkable that she\n\nshould not be there for always.\n Ma Lou belonged to them as they belonged to her.\n Brid used to think that their lives and Ma Lou's were intertwined\n\nlike the Scotchman fig which grew on to the big silk-cotton tree, twisting\n\nand embedding itself into the trunk of the other to such an extent that it\n\nwas hard to figure out which was the silk-cotton and which the fig.\n It was Ma Lou who made all the decisions now about the family, she\n\nwho planted the crops and sold what needed to be sold to earn them a little\n\ncash, she who went to market to buy; she who fed them and looked after them,\n\nfor Mama was now helpless as a child.\n Brid never understood what was wrong with Mama; she only knew she had\n\ntaken to her bed after Papa left ( which she was too young to remember) and\n\nhadn't ever left her room again. \n\n  When Jesse went off to Kingston she promised to write, but it was\n\nthree months now since they'd heard from her.\n In her first letters Jesse had told of the grand reception she had\n\nhad from Aunt Irene and Uncle Cyrus and her cousins, about her new wardrobe,\n\nher new life.", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '1ebe8884-b3dc-4101-a011-3f8c0679f875', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.502314+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9942699074745178, 'non_english_score': 0.005730092525482178}

But there is no\n\nother word to describe the night around you.\n Only that the smells of the sugar-cane plants, of the woodfires off\n\nsomewhere which you cannot see, of the rain-made mud, baked by the day\'s sun,\n\nof the saltiness carried by the warm sea-breeze, will mingle with the smell\n\nand the feel of the velvet dark caressing every part of your body ( even\n\nthose which you didn\'t even know you had while bathing).\n These are the days long before fluorescent electric street lights.\n Those little twinkling lights you have been seeing all around you are\n\npeeny-wallies or the lights could be just before your own eyes, coming out of\n\nyour own head \x13 so charged up are you on the sheer delight of this night.\n\n\n\n  Look to the left, across the swamps just after you pass Six\n\nMiles.\n You see some bigger lights there, don\'t you?\n Ah, those are bottle torches.\n You may want to stop here and go in search of the carriers of those\n\nbottle torches. \n\n  If you have a crocus bag and can get hold of a strong stick, then\n\nyou may indeed be in for a unique experience and one which is pleasurable at\n\nthat.\n You are going to catch yourself some land crabs \x13 free of cost.\n If you haven\'t yet experienced crab catching, don\'t leave it too\n\nlong.\n For in later years, especially during the big development boom of the\n\nsixties, high-flying entrepreneurs are going to mark out much of that\n\nswampland as prime for their development.\n They are going to blast out and dump up most of this land, killing\n\ngenerations of land crabs and crayfish and destroying all their holes & for\n\never. \n\n  So, hopefully, you have stopped to join the crab catchers. They\n\nhave made up a bottle torch for you, wetting a bit of old rag with kerosene\n\noil, then wadding it into the neck of a bottle ( it\'s not a Molotov Cocktail,\n\nso don\'t get jumpy).\n See how it flares up when you light the top end of the oil-soaked\n\nrag, then burns down steady.\n Almost as good as a proper lamp, isn\'t it \x13 except for a little black\n\nsmoke and the acrid stench of the kerosene.\n The crab catchers have shown you how to hold your crocus bag in one\n\nhand, the bottle torch in the other, to tread softly to where the crabs are\n\nhiding in the bushes after their holes have become too waterlogged and hot\n\nfor them \x13 and to shine the bottle torch in their eyes ( oops! not the crab\n\ncatcher\'s eyes, you would be treading on very dangerous ground there). \n\n  You have to be quick and ready for when the crabs are\n\ndisorientated in their fright.\n You have to, in one motion, shove the crocus bag under your arm ( not\n\nthe one holding the bottle torch), get the strong stick from under the arm\n\nwhere the bag now rests, into your hand where the bag was, give the crab a\n\ngentle tap with the stick in the region between its two protruding eyes and\n\nthen bring the crocus bag down into your hand, using the stick to bring\n\ninside it the stunned and blinded crab.\n Make sure that the mouth of the crocus bag is now tightly secured and\n\nthat you don\'t hold the bag with the now angry, definitely protesting crab\n\ntoo near to any part of your body. \n\n  A bit too much for you, is it?\n But that\'s only for beginners.\n The seasoned crab catchers, as you will no doubt have noticed, don\'t\n\nneed to go through all that.\n They only find it necessary to stun the crab when it has left its\n\nhole sometime before and is running about.\n Once the crab is stationary for even two seconds, the seasoned crab\n\nman pounces upon it with his bare hands ( women don\'t go much into crab\n\ncatching except in exceptional circumstances) and holds it firmly on both\n\nsides of its shell in a way which leaves the wicked claws dangling uselessly,\n\nthen pops it neatly into the crocus bag.\n Those are the sweetest crabs to eat because the meat is unbattered.\n\n\n\n  Oh, but the crab catchers have suggested that you not try that\n\nmethod, have they?\n Quite correct.\n Don\'t mind the crab catchers\' abrasive exterior and their seemingly\n\nsuperior manner.\n Jamaicans are very warm-hearted people.\n Would share our last dumpling with another person or even give it all\n\nto them if we felt the person needed it more ( qualification \x13 most\n\nJamaicans).\n But we are not too up on the little European polite niceties and have\n\na disturbing ( to some) penchant for talking the brutal truth in an equally\n\nbrutal tone of voice.\n So, don\'t be vexed when the crab catchers grind out some curse at you\n\nwhen you try to use the seasoned method, ignoring their instructions.\n It is for your own good.\n They are even more concerned than you could be for you to continue\n\nyour journey with all of your fingers intact. \n\n  Ah, the crab catching is over.\n Caught any?\n Doesn\'t matter, you will still get crab to eat.\n They have found a reasonably dry spot in the swamp.\n They\'ll get a fire, so long as they can find some reasonably dry\n\nwood.\n Fire starts with too much smoke.\n Someone blows on it.\n They put on the kerosene tin ( in case you don\'t know, don\'t be\n\nmisled, it didn\'t contain kerosene oil before, more likely coconut oil, it\'s\n\nonly called that).\n Salt and lots of red, yellow and green peppers into the kerosene tin.\n Water begins to bubble.\n In go the crabs from the bags.\n Don\'t bother to try this one.\n Let the seasoned ones take over here.\n You would probably lose three-quarters of the crabs and end up\n\nmissing pieces of your anatomy as well.\n They put one hand down into the crocus bag.\n Several crabs try to make a desperate jump for freedom.\n But the other hand is holding the mouth of the bag & tight.\n Just enough room for the one hand to expertly grasp the crab nearest\n\nthe top of the bag & in its back & and & pop! & into the kerosene tin &\n\nmaking the supreme, involuntary sacrifice to the gastronomic desires of the\n\ncrab catchers. \n\n  You wait until the crabs are boiled, telling yourself that you\n\nwant to get on with your journey.\n But the night and the crab catchers are embracing you.\n This type of Jamaican is asking nothing of you or about you.\n They didn\'t want you to help them to get to America, did they?\n Or to get a job in Kingston?\n They don\'t want to know whether you are rich or poor?\n Whether you have come from good family or not?\n To them, your only qualification for joining the crabbing community\n\nis for you to comfortable-up yourself in whatever situation you found\n\nyourself, to be one with the community and not try to be a conqueror over the\n\ncommunity.\n And to have strong loins, which is their word for personal courage.\n\n\n\n  You have apparently passed the test.\n In humility and thankfulness, you sit on the swampy ground with the\n\ncrab catchers around the crab-filled, bubbling kerosene tin.\n They have stuck the bottle torches into the ground, creating an oasis\n\nof fire and light in the dark swampland.\n As you listen to their ribald laughter, rough sex stories, their\n\nduppy stories, as you feel that night, smell the intimate stink of the swamp,\n\nhear the sounds which form the undertone of the night, you are thinking that\n\nyou will move on soon, but certainly, not too soon. \n\n  You are very worried, aren\'t you?\n \'just relax and enjoy yourself\'.\n\n\n But another side of you is feeling guilty as hell, isn\'t it?\n You oughtn\'t to be feeling so happy.\n Look how many things there are for you to do and to worry about.\n \'it\'\n\n is), oughtn\'t you? \n\n  You resign yourself to the moment.\n \'it\'\n\n when you leave this spot and this moment.\n You relax and watch the crab catchers as they take out the condensed\n\ncan ( got its name because it originally contained condensed milk but now\n\nmade into a tin cup).\n They pour something into the condensed can.\n You sip from the condensed can as it goes around the whole group.\n If you are a certain type of visitor from America or Europe or some\n\nupper-class Jamaican  topanaris  , you have literally let down\n\nyour hair ( or hairpiece) by this time.\n You cannot be bothered if Black people and especially these rough\n\nBlack people have  \'foot and mouth\'  disease. \n\n  You sip, just like all the others.\n Your face becomes another shade of red in the bottle-torch\n\nfirelight.\n You try hard not to cough as the fiery contents of the condensed can\n\nattack your throat and guts.\n You haven\'t coughed but they guess what you are going through.\n They pass you the butter pan ( that is the one which is used to\n\ncontain butter from America).\n Yes, the contents of the butter pan do cool your burning throat,\n\nsettle over your fiery guts, calm it down, send a bolt of energy through your\n\nwhole system.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'cbfdec44-a5cd-47db-98b3-bb6f173dacaf', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.503769+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9700577855110168, 'non_english_score': 0.029942214488983154}
{'text': "After Rat Man was killed, and the police didn't arrest anyone for\n\nit, it appeared that almost everyone between Gordon Town and Guava Ridge had\n\nbeen up at the  house that night.\n It appeared that I owed a great deal to a great many.\n Bob told me to refuse to consider whether or not I was under any\n\nobligation.\n Just make it clear that anything you do for people is because you want\n\nto do it, not because you owe it to them.\n\n\n  If you do, Bob said, you'd better figure out what it was worth to\n\nyou, and how you're going to pay it back.\n Maybe you can organise a death squad against some of the other petty\n\nthieves around here.\n\n\n  Lloyd had recently been fired supposedly because of the\n\ninordinate number of sacks of fertiliser that went missing from his truck\n\nbetween the farm store in Kingston and the farm.\n He had come to see us and explained that some of his neighbours grew\n\ncoffee, and they didn't like it if Lloyd couldn't  'free up' \n\na few sacks of fertiliser now and again.\n He said the real reason he'd been fired was that the foreman's\n\nbrother was a driver, who had just returned from a job in St Mary.\n The brother got Lloyd's job.\n Within two weeks my friend Lloyd who used to stop his truck when he\n\nsaw me on the road and joke with me for five minutes about his troublesome\n\ndaughters and all the worthless people he had to work with, was waving me\n\ndown to tell me he had no food in the house, the babies were hungry et\n\ncetera.\n He was bitter enough to take money from Bob.\n I never offered him any, against the day when he would be working\n\nagain and we could meet as friends. \n\n  Bob said you can't afford to have friends that are so much poorer\n\nthan you are.\n There's no way to avoid being their benefactor.\n Lloyd needs benefactors, he can be friends with Louise who at least\n\ncan appreciate his worries.\n\n\n  I had to stop being appalled shortly after Rat Man got killed.\n I stopped having enough time to be horrified by anything.\n BMW's resources, in the form of Bob and I, were stretched to the\n\nlimit in an effort to prevent us from killing each other, getting married,\n\nbreaking up, running away together.\n On the days on which I called him at his office to tell him I loved\n\nhim and couldn't we move to one of the other islands where he could go\n\nfishing and I could build houses, Bob had to say he liked it right here in\n\nJamaica and he was sure I'd be miserable without Richard and Rose and Carla.\n saying\n\nhe was going to ask Sandy for a divorce and carry me off to the Bahamas, I\n\nhad to say I didn't want to marry him and the only place I hated more than\n\nNassau was Miami.\n\n\n  It was when he told me that I had to learn how to stop being such\n\na soft touch, because I'd given two dollars to a little boy cleaning\n\nwindscreens at the traffic lights \x13 the same little boy to whom Bob normally\n\ngave five dollars for the same inadequate smearing around of the  driveway mud \x13 that was when it was hard.\n When I told him I was sick of him drinking half a bottle of rum on\n\nSaturday, and half a bottle of whisky on Sunday, even though he never got\n\ndrunk, I could see him deep breathing so as not to hit me.\n That was the other thing \x13 although he was very gentle, he was also a\n\nhitting sort of man.\n He would talk, talk, talk, drink, talk some more, but I could tell it\n\nwas just a way of not hitting me. \n\n  Carla said, As long as he never hits you.\n Everybody feels violent sometimes.\n But Bob felt violent a lot of the time.\n He loved me but I frustrated him.\n He saw things simply; I was sure everything was much more complicated\n\nthan it looked.\n When we were talking about Rose, I saw a woman who had fashioned her\n\nlife, and had made a success of it; Bob thought she was a disappointed woman\n\nwho was good at making the best of things.\n Most importantly, Bob thought he was entitled to his opinion and I\n\nwas never sure that he was. \n\n  Bob thought we had to make a few compromises.\n I realised he was trying to bully me into submission.\n When we agreed to disagree, he would get annoyed when I made one last\n\nattempt to make him see it my way.\n Bob thought our relationship was about being in love, talking, going\n\nto the beach, making plans, going to bed.\n\n\n  'How can I? You think you know everything already.'\n\n \n\n  .\n\n \n\n  He could remember every single time I'd ever contradicted him.\n Before we were sleeping together I responded very well to Bob's\n\nmonologues.\n I would ask questions about details, laugh at the jokes, lead him\n\ninto the next story.\n By the time we were sleeping together we were nearly getting to\n\ndiscussing his marriage to Sandy, his second wife.\n I didn't want to hear about the marriage to Sandy.\n As I loved her husband more and more, I felt more and more guilty\n\nabout Sandy.\n I could feel how she must love him, not want to lose him, and I knew\n\nas well as she did how very willing he was to lose her. \n\n  Bob was like me.\n He preferred to be the only witness to what he'd done and been.\n Other people's memories of the same events only spoiled our stories.\n They didn't remember us as we knew we had been then.\n Sandy was there when Bob was struggling to build a business, I was\n\ntold about the inevitable triumph.\n I knew the man who had been bound to succeed.\n And Bob knew Katherine as presented by Katherine.\n He never challenged my version of events, and I never challenged his.\n\n\n\n  At first, of course, when I thought he was Santo Mach II, I\n\nthought this was because we knew how to leave each other alone.\n Once I slept with him, loved him, I started worrying that it was\n\nbecause he didn't care enough to notice that I was slightly imperfect.\n I started criticising him as I hadn't done since the day we went on\n\nthe boat.\n I remembered why we had quarrelled the night Rat Man was killed.\n I realised I had been massively duped into believing that Bob was a\n\nkind, gentle, reflective, interesting, understanding man \x13 unlike all other\n\nmen.\n He told me all those things about himself and I'd accepted him, and\n\nthem, without doing any primary research. \n\n  Primary research revealed he was opportunistic \x13 business,\n\nmanipulative \x13 women, selfish \x13 Sandy, patronising \x13 me, overbearing \x13\n\nme, a terrible liar \x13 rumour, a crook \x13 rumour.\n When I confronted him with this evidence of duplicity, he laughed and\n\nhugged me, and said,  'I used to think you were pretty nice too.'\n\n \n\n  Rose encouraged me enthusiastically to love Bob.\n She was back in love with Derek who'd been promoted and had a company\n\ncar.\n He sold his new car, extorting twice what he'd paid for it from\n\nsomeone who couldn't get an import licence, and gave Rose back her twenty\n\nthousand dollars, having cleared a hundred thousand on the deal.\n Rose had really wanted to ask Derek for some sort of commission, or\n\ninterest, on her money, which he'd had for over a year.\n\n\n  In the real world Bob was negotiating with his partners for more\n\ntime in Jamaica.\n I never gave it a thought.\n We were building a spa on a sheer rock face in Portland and I was out\n\nof Kingston three days in the week.\n Then the roads collapsed at one of the new coffee plantations in the\n\nYallahs Valley and, although it was a long way into the mountains from where\n\nI lived, the worries of the fifty or sixty people thrown out of work began\n\nfiltering back to BMW.\n Lloyd had disappeared, apparently to look for work in another part of\n\nthe island.\n His daughters were pestering me for jobs cleaning, sewing, cooking,\n\nlooking after children, as none of their babyfathers were in a position to\n\ncontract for these services.\n Their own children began appearing on the road looking for mangoes,\n\nthree- and four-year-olds that looked and smelled motherless. \n\n  I was always busy and always tired.\n On weekends I started getting up at five o'clock in the morning to\n\nhave time to go walking by myself.\n When Bob came we often spent whole afternoons in bed, not making love\n\nbut sleeping.\n I only slept well when he was there.\n By myself, during the week, I stayed up late reading and smoking,\n\ntrying to think, trying not to come to any conclusions.\n A few times Louise came and knocked on the verandah door and told me\n\nto go to bed. \n\n  One night I came back early from Portland where we'd discovered\n\nthe Caribbean Sea running deep and blue under the rock where we were planning\n\nto put the foundations.\n Someone, not me, was going to have to mention it to the client.\n For the first time in a long time I was home before sunset and drank\n\na whole jug of rum and orange juice on the verandah.\n I was asleep on the sofa, which I had dragged outside, when Bob came.\n He spent about five minutes telling me how crazy I was to go to sleep\n\nwith the house open, and no one around to make sure I didn't get my throat\n\ncut.\n Then he made another jug of rum and juice and got on to the sofa with\n\nme. \n\n  'I have to go to the States tomorrow. To see my\n\npartners.'  \n\n \n He often went back for a few days, on business.\n\n\n  'A couple of weeks.\n We've got to think up a whole new distribution system for the gourmet\n\nside.\n\n\n \n\n  He looked at me, held my hand.\n 'Of course, I'm coming back.\n\n\n  'Just that if you're not coming back, you should tell\n\nme.\n\n\n  He was supposed to laugh but he didn't.\n He let go of my hand.\n 'You can go downtown at seven o'clock in the morning like\n\neveryone else.\n\n\n \n\n\n  'I have to.\n\n\n  'Good.\n\n\n  'You found the sea.\n I called your office to find out if you were back.\n Rose says she's spending the night moving all the buildings half an\n\ninch to the right.\n\n\n  I laughed.\n 'She's going to have to move them much more than half an\n\ninch.\n\n\n\n\n  'Well, isn't that why you should be down there?

{'text': 'wasn\'t until that morning that I realized there\n\nmust be something to a belief in Obeah, some kernel of truth among the ritual\n\nand superstition.\n Until that moment, when I found myself on that wet country road,\n\nstaring in shock at my mudsplattered car, I had laughed at Obeah and its\n\nbelievers.\n I had scoffed at them for their remedies for every one of life\'s\n\nproblems -  Oil of Don\'t Come Back  to be rid of a tiresome lover,\n\nand  Salt of Stay   to keep remembered pain from\n\nreturning.\n\n\n  But that morning, in the chill and damp of dawn,

forgive me for my insensitivity.\n She had been our live-in maid in my teen years.\n Across the yard from the backdoor a barrackslike structure\n\nprovided simple housing for this goodhearted woman

her.\n She went to the local Obeah-man for advice, and then to the small\n\npharmacy on the market square to buy the  Oil of Gweh fi Good \n\nrecommended by the Obeah-man.\n She showed me the old Coca-Cola bottle half full of green liquid, a\n\ndirty rag stuffed into the top as a stopper. \n\n  " Him say I mus sprinkle it pon di bed every night before\n\nI go to sleep.\n\n And it must have

But on that early summer morning such sensible thinking seemed out of\n\nplace.\n Besides, there was the evidence, one drab green Vauxhall liberally\n\nsplattered with mud and loosened soil.\n The pattern of freshly dug sepia-red earth scattered across the front\n\nof the old car drew the eye to the bumper and the scar it had left in the\n\nembankment. \n\n  to her\n\njumbie as an agent of the devil.\n\n She hadn\'t explained how that would be accomplished but the term\n\n " agent of the devil"  had been familiar to me.\n It was a favourite of my high school principal, a portly, middle-aged\n\nwoman given to lecturing loudly and at length on matters of discipline.\n interpretation of the phrase that I\n\nthought of that morning as I looked into the car at my travelling companion,\n\nLydia.\n She was calmly retrieving those items in her bag that had been strewn\n\nabout the backseat, stopping now and then to flip her long hair over her\n\nshoulder.\n It was a mish mash of things in her bag, carved masks with straw hair\n\nand bright eyes, brightly coloured cards with snake symbols on some and more\n\notherworldly stuff I did not recognize.\n\n\n  Lydia had dropped in unexpectedly to renew a brief acquaintance.\n I had met her while on holiday at a South American resort.\n " If you should\n\nget to Jamaica, look me up." \n I came to regret that friendly impulse which had brought the young\n\nwoman with the oversized knapsack to my door. \n\n  Lydia had arrived just before one of the few long weekends that I\n\ntake off from my work.\n I had been looking forward for months to a restful visit with my\n\nfriend Joanna in Negril.\n "\n\nthe more, the merrier."  \n\n  By setting out early on the Friday afternoon, we beat the worst\n\nof the weekend traffic which clogged the roads in Spanish Town and May Pen.\n The trucks of women going to market slowed the climb to Mandeville.\n For miles we watched plump women and baskets of produce bouncing\n\nabout on makeshift benches in old, exhaust- belching trucks. \n\n  I passed the time trying to quiz Lydia on her plans, where she\n\nwas coming from, and more importantly, where and when she was going.\n Lydia wasn\'t very forthcoming with answers, leaving odd gaps in her\n\nstory.\n My focus was on the road so that, to me, her vagueness was just an\n\nimpression rather than something specific. \n\n  We stopped for English-style high tea in the new Manchester Hotel\n\nbefore making our way over the narrow, pothole-riddled road to\n\nSavanna-la-Mar.\n This time it was the drays, the market-bound, mule-drawn carts laden\n\nwith plantains and yams that slowed our progress. \n\n  Dusk was darkening into night when we arrived at Joanna\'s\n\nbungalow near Negril.\n It was close enough for us to smell a hint of sea salt in the air,\n\nyet too far away to hear the sea\'s swish on sand. \n\n  Five hours of driving on narrow, poorly kept roads and I was\n\nready for a quiet evening.\n But the others had different ideas.\n " a quaint\n\nlittle bar right on the beach"  , and Lydia enthusiastically hurried\n\nus out the door. \n\n  The bar was little more than a hut of wooden boards and thatch\n\nroofing.\n Its rum-barrel tables spilled out onto the sand.\n The place was obviously popular with tourists and locals, and with\n\nthe skimpily-clad young women who seem to come with the furniture in such\n\nplaces.\n We sat at a table on the edge of the wooden floor, just far enough\n\naway from the reggae-blaring loudspeakers to allow for conversation. \n\n  said Joanna.\n Then she leaned closer and pointed out a group at a table closer to\n\nthe bar.\n\n\n  I looked at three men.\n The chains about their necks, exposed in the open fronts of their\n\nshirts, folded into the creases of their chests.\n\n\n\n  No sooner said than one of them got up and came over to our\n\ntable.\n His teeth shone white and false in his face as he smiled at us.\n\n\n\n  .\n Joanna answered for all of us but Lydia\'s smile must have been\n\nencouraging. \n\n  "\n\nWell, perhaps we could join you ladies and buy the next round."  .\n The smile disappeared from Lydia\'s face and she glared at him.\n\n\n\n  he said.\n\n\n  Lydia called after him.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  " You need something to ward off the evil spirits in\n\nhere,"  I said. \n\n  Joanna laughed with us, but then she became defensive.\n " They\'re not such a bad bunch here. Not all of them are\n\naging Lotharios."  \n\n  Lydia was more impressed with the place than I.\n She kept drawing our attention away from the suntanned men at the bar\n\nto the odd bits and pieces hung on the walls and pillars.\n Chicken-feathered voodoo masks, and Mexican sugar-skulls were tucked\n\ninto the fishnetting strung about in what must have started as an attempt at\n\nseaside decor. \n\n  said\n\nLydia.\n You don\'t really notice them until you look closely& then\n\nthere they are, these ghoulish things staring at me."  \n\n  " Yeah, they\'re almost as goodlooking as the guys."\n\n\n\n\n  Joanna protested.\n\n\n  I\n\nsaid.\n " There\'s no one interesting around.

{'text': 'She had found it all very interesting at first.\n Now she was cold, the airconditioning was up too high and she longed\n\nto be out in the fresh air.\n This year, the expressions were, " \'ensuring access\'\n\n" , " \'equitability of resources\' " , " \'sustainable\n\ndevelopment\' " .\n She listened to them rolling off so easily, in a variety of\n\naccents, a sort of verbal talisman against defeat.\n She also knew the reality, the small, ill-equipped clinics with rows\n\nof mothers queuing up for immunization shots for their babies, or for family\n\nplanning methods, or for a multitude of ailments, for which there were not\n\nenough medicines. \n\n  She tried to concentrate on the presentation from Trinidad.\n An attractive man with a long title was speaking and she listened with\n\nonly half an ear to the content while she enjoyed the lilt of his accent.\n Horace had decided to go to Carnival in Trinidad this year and she had\n\nbeen amused at the contortions he had gotten into because he did not want her\n\nto go with him. \n\n \n\n  she said.\n \'You know I have this conference coming up in Washington.\'\n\n \n\n  And so it had been settled and he had gone with a show of\n\nreluctance, he was only going really because the  \'boys\'  were\n\ngoing. \n\n  She adjusted her conference papers, although they were already\n\nimpeccably arranged, and noted, with a small frown of annoyance, that she had\n\nsnagged one of her neatly filed, unpolished nails. \n\n  It was over.\n They could leave.\n There would be a reception later that evening and then three more\n\ndays of talks.\n she thought, steering her way out\n\nto the foyer and on to the small bus waiting to take them back to their\n\nhotel.\n\n\n  \'I enjoyed your presentation this morning.\n\n\n\n\n  \'don\'t let anyone\n\nhear you say that.\n We\'re all trying so hard to pretend that we\'re not desperate, that we\n\ndon\'t resent having to  " perform"  for the damn aid because\n\nwe know full well that we daren\'t go home without at least a significant\n\npromise.\'  \n\n  His name tag identified him as Dr Sam Bowen and he was also\n\nJamaican.\n\n\n  and he named one\n\nof the large international health agencies.\n \'So I thought I should seem knowledgeable about what was\n\ngoing on in the region.\'  \n\n  She felt a tinge of annoyance, yet another professional desert\n\n<l> ing, chasing after the big money, then immediately felt that she was\n\nprobably being unfair, judgemental.\n They talked for a while and she found out that he was in research and\n\nhe was, in fact, being recruited to work on a parasitology project which\n\ninvolved several other countries. \n\n  she said, hoping\n\nthat he was not going to bore her with details of tapeworms. \n\n \n\n  Nellie took a long, hot bath and reluctantly prepared for the\n\nreception.\n She felt restless, irritable. She combed her hair and saw a clump of\n\ngrey hairs curling delicately at her temples.\n They looked very white against her brown skin and she wondered if she\n\nshould pull them out.\n She examined her face closely, a few wrinkles at the corners of her\n\neyes, and those sparkling, robust grey hairs. \n\n  \'what\n\nthe hell do I want?\'  \n\n  She lay on her bed for a while, staring at the bland hotel\n\nfurnishings and the ubiquitous Gideon Bible.\n So many hotel rooms, in all sorts of places.\n So many conferences and seminars, she was weary of it all.\n She was also weary of Horace.\n About a year ago she had suddenly stopped caring about his affairs.\n They no longer bothered her.\n She felt even sorry for the women, so ill at ease, and only able to\n\nbe relaxed with her when it was over.\n\n\n  It was all so silly, so pointless, this endless chasing and\n\nmating.\n He wouldn\'t talk about it, of course, as the pretence was that they\n\nwere such a happy, successful couple.\n And indeed they were.\n Letters came addressed to them as Mr and Mrs.\n They had dinner parties, they agreed about politics and supported the\n\nsame charities.\n Horace had his affairs and sometimes she thought he had them just to\n\nkeep in with the swing of things, it was expected of an attractive,\n\nsuccessful man.\n For he had made it plain, after a stormy evening of accusations on\n\nher part, denials on his, that he had no intention of leaving.\n He was happy in his marriage.\n But she knew, he loved the thrill of flirtation, he liked variety and\n\nconquest and Horace liked women physically.\n He was a connoisseur of breasts and legs and he always chose\n\nintelligent, independent women who would not become clinging or demanding as\n\nHorace was also a bit mean.\n He did not want to have to get into taking this one out to expensive\n\ndinners or into buying that one costly little trinkets.\n He was horrified by those of his friends who had dependent, young\n\ngirlfriends who needed to have the rent paid, the trip to Miami paid for and\n\nthrew tantrums if the birthday gift was not sparkling enough.\n No, Horace did not want the expense nor the possibility of unpleasant\n\nscenes.\n He valued privacy and discretion.\n Having an attractive and intelligent wife and having affairs with\n\nbright, emancipated women was a perfect situation. \n\n  she wondered.\n The situation was comfortable for her also.\n She liked her work, she liked the large, attractive home that they\n\nhad made together.\n She did not want to be out there, a woman alone, she liked being part\n\nof a family, part of so many little routines, observances.\n And besides, she had a sort of horror at the thought of being seen as\n\nbeing alone, in need of masculine attention.\n She shuddered at the thought of being with another man in an intimate\n\nsituation, taking off her clothes, revealing herself to someone she didn\'t\n\nreally know.\n It was not a suitable situation for her, that was all, even the word\n\n" \'boyfriend\' " sounded ridiculous. \n\n  She got up and finished dressing.\n she thought.\n \'I just think I should be because my husband chooses to be\n\nunfaithful.\' \n And she laughed at herself because it was really very foolish to\n\nchoose to be unhappy over the choices and behaviour of someone else. \n\n  People milled around in the reception room and ate strange things\n\non little pieces of toast.\n Sam turned up and offered to fetch her a drink and they stood talking\n\nfor a while. \n\n  he suggested.\n \'I don\'t like this kind of nonsense food, as my father used\n\nto call it.\'  \n\n \n\n\n  \'Well, was a farmer.\n He liked good, simple food, on a plate, at a table.\n He didn\'t hold with walking around and eating, or just as bad,\n\nbalancing your plate in your lap.\' \n Sam smiled and she noticed that he had a very attractive, large,\n\nwell- shaped mouth.\n He was altogether a tall, sturdy sort of man, and she could imagine\n\nhim growing up in the country eating good country food. \n\n  They found a small restaurant near to the hotel and fell into an\n\neasy conversation.\n He talked about growing up in the country and winning a scholarship\n\nto go to university.\n She talked about growing up in the city with loving but strict\n\nchurch-going parents.\n She mentioned meeting Horace at university and marrying him but\n\nshe felt uncomfortable talking about Horace, it seemed disloyal somehow.\n Sam was not married, couldn\'t afford it on his university salary, he\n\njoked, but really there had been someone serious, but he had been so wrapped\n\nup in his research, she had grown tired of waiting for him to emerge from his\n\nbooks and his lab and she had gone off and married someone else. \n\n  he finished\n\nand laughed. \n\n  she\n\nasked. \n\n  \'Oh yes, at the time.\n\n\n  \'See you\'re married to a businessman, wealthy, well\n\nknown.\n I\'m sure you would not have hung around waiting for a research\n\nstudent to surface.\'  \n\n  \'Well, of course, I would have, if I had been in love\n\nwith him.\n she added and wondered why she sounded a bit\n\ndefensive,  \'he wasn\'t wealthy and well known then.\'  \n\n \n Sam pretended to be horrified.\n\n\n  thought Nellie.\n She wondered what it was, that thing, so many years ago, that had\n\ntaken her into a marriage, into having children and had now left her, adrift\n\nin a city she did not know with a man she did not know. \n\n  They lingered over coffee.\n\n\nshe said. \n\n  he said.\n\n\n  The street was full of shops, brightly lit and they strolled\n\naround, looking into shop windows, deciding on the merits of various bits of\n\nfurniture, high-tech appliances.\n At a dress shop, Sam pointed out a dress that he thought she would\n\nlook good in.\n\n\n  Nellie laughed.\n \'You must be mad.\n I would never wear something like that.\n\n\n  \'you\'re not old\n\nand you have a terrific figure.\'  \n\n  she thought, suddenly acutely\n\nuncomfortable,  \'I hope he\'s not trying to flirt.\n It\'s too ridiculous.\n\n From time to time, there had been men, usually balding, raunchy,\n\npaunchy, who tried to make a pass at her.\n\n\n  she said, turning\n\nin the direction of the hotel. \n\n  he said.\n \'Now you\'re all uptight with me.\n Why?\n I haven\'t had such a good evening in a long time.\n To be honest, I\'m not often very comfortable with women.\n Mostly I don\'t know what to talk about.\n Its the damned tapeworms.\n I mean, it hardly makes for the start of a glamorous and romantic\n\nconversation.\'  \n\n  She laughed and they were comfortable with each other again.\n\n\n\n  she thought later, alone\n\nin her room.\n \'Comfort, a feeling that I can say whatever I want.\n\n And so she drifted comfortably towards sleep, surprised by the\n\nnewness of it all, that she could be friends with a man. \n\n  They met the next afternoon, it was cool and sunny and they went\n\nwalking in the park. \n\n  she\n\nsaid.\n \'But it\'s so nice not to be sitting in a cold conference\n\nroom, not to be on a schedule.\n\n\n  he said.\n\n\n  She said congratulatory things, she said they must celebrate,\n\nbut she began to feel unaccountably sad.\n she thought.\n\n He also grew quiet.\n He had never lived abroad before.\n What if he hated it, couldn\'t bear the winter?\n She said reassuring things, it would be an adventure, meeting\n\npeople, making friends, he would love it, she said.\n She thought she sounded much as she had when her children were going\n\noff to college and had a last minute panic about going.\n She had said the same sort of things later, organizing their\n\ntickets, their luggage, taking them to the airport.\n Only, watching their heads disappear into the departure lounge, she\n\nfelt that she had said all the wrong things, she had sent them away when she\n\nwished desperately for them to stay.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL',

{'text': 'Mr. Kevin Mills said\n\nto his wife, Ava,  " Independence celebrations and Reggae Sunsplash\n\nare here, so if you cannot believe that I came close to but did not sleep\n\nwith my former secretary you should at least let yourself forgive me for that\n\nwhich you  \'think\'  I am guilty of."   .\n\n  Ava remained silent.\n face stoic.\n It was 8 o\'clock on the Saturday morning before both Jamaica\'s 1993\n\nIndependence Day celebrations and the beginning of Reggae Sunsplash music\n\nfestival. \n\n  Mr. and Mrs. Mills, both 36 years old, were seated in their\n\nkitchen, having breakfast.\n Their three children \x13 a teenager and two pre-teens \x13 were gone to\n\nvisit an aunt.\n The Kingston 6 upper-middle class neighbourhood was quiet, the\n\nMills\'s bungalow cool and fragrant, the summer heat not yet full blast. \n\n  Part of Ava wanted to believe her husband\'s avowal of innocence.\n Ever since that unforgettable day a month ago when she had caught him\n\nkissing his former secretary \x13 a pert young quadroon and former beauty queen\n\n\x13 he had been swearing that  \'it\'  had not gone any further.\n Before this morning she\'d been sure he\'d been lying: weren\'t all men\n\nliars about fidelity, as her own father had been?\n Now she was tempted to believe him; and she knew he wasn\'t anywhere\n\nnear as  " bad"  as her father had been to her mother.\n And he had meekly accepted her demand that he hire a male secretary,\n\nhad even allowed her to choose the young man. \n\n  " How many other women or girls have you been kissing and\n\ncaressing?"  Ava now asked, breaking the silence. She nibbled her\n\ntoast. \n\n  Mr. Mills responded, scratching his\n\nlittle beard. \n\n \n It fell from her lips like a steel ball, causing Mr. Mills to wince\n\nslightly.\n " So, you are telling me that you have been one of\n\nthe  \'few\'  truly faithful husbands one hears about, faithful\n\nexcept for kissing and caressing your former secretary that is?" \n\n\n\n  Mr. Mills said, meeting her demanding\n\ngaze.\n Their eyes held.\n He squirmed.\n " Well.. well& about four years ago I was drunk and& well\n\nhad& slept with a long time girlfriend.\n he avowed\n\nsincerely.\n\n\n  VA\'S GUT feeling told her he was being honest.\n " I am not pleased to know you have betrayed our vows, but at\n\nleast you aren\'t half as  \'bad\'  as my father was." \n\n\n\n  , "\n\n he vowed.\n " With Reggae Sunsplash here in\n\nKingston for the first time we\'ll be able to go every night.\n Should be more enjoyable than it was in Mobay, for us Kingstonians\n\nthat is.\n Monday will be a day to remember \x13 what, with Independence Gala in\n\nthe evening and Sunsplash\'s opening night Beach Party we\'ll be having the\n\ntime of our lives.\n\n\n  Ava was smiling at him but wasn\'t listening attentively.\n She was remembering how last year she had found herself pulsing with\n\na strong desire for a co-worker after dancing with him at a private party on\n\nIndependence Day.\n\n\nabout him and even imagined she was in bed with him.\n That was the closest she\'d ever come to being unfaithful to her\n\nhusband.\n\n\n  Still, she mused, sipping her coffee, she saw no reason why her\n\nhusband shouldn\'t be true to their marriage vows. \n\n  Mr. Mills half-shouted,\n\nbanging on the small hardwood table. \n\n  she said, snapping out of her\n\nthoughts. \n\n  " Here I was spouting my grand plans for Independence and\n\nSunsplash, and you woolgathering."  \n\n  " Forgive me.\n But, anyway, you know I love to enjoy my partying without too much\n\nplanning."  \n\n  he laughed, then sipped his\n\ncoffee.\n " Let my plans come as surprises then.\n\n\n  " I hope you have nothing as earth-shaking as those crazy\n\nsailor and night- tart costumes you had us wear to the Sunsplash Dancehall\n\nNight last year?"  \n\n  He grinned.\n\n\n\n\n \n She lowered her lashes, almost blushing.\n " All the same, Sunsplash and Independence or not I\'m still\n\nsuspicious and mad at you for kissing that damn little tease.\n\n\n \n\n  ILENCE.\n Each lost in thought, wondering if there was a weak spot in their\n\nmarriage.\n They sat there in thoughtful silence for several minutes, but neither\n\nof them saw the weak spot; and both might have been surprised if they knew\n\nthat they were having similar thoughts. \n\n  she said,\n\nending their silence and thoughts. \n\n  " or should I\n\ngo tidy our room."  \n\n  she said, wanting to be\n\nalone. \n\n \n\n  They kept out of each other\'s way for the rest of the morning.\n In the afternoon he left for the race track, a regular act that Ava\n\nknew was mostly to find favour with his horse-loving boss, the chairman and\n\nmajor share-holder of High Lane group of companies. \n\n  Ava had dinner ready when Mr. Mills returned from the track in\n\nthe evening.\n Then they were both getting ready for separate parties, a common\n\nhappening with them in the last five years \x13 parties and dinners each thought\n\nwas important to his / her own career. \n\n  They left the kids in care of two college students from next\n\ndoor. \n\n  As usual with the Mills on Sundays, next morning they slept late,\n\nsent the kids to church ( only rarely did Mr. and Mrs. Mills go to church),\n\nand spent the afternoon and evening close to their children \x13 the only\n\nregular  " quality time"  they gave their children. \n\n  There was one major difference to that Sunday, though.\n Mr. Mills and his wife did a lot of thinking about their marriage,\n\neach now convinced that there was a weak spot in their marriage.\n The day ended with neither of them seeing the weak spot or voicing\n\ntheir concern. \n\n  Next day was Independence Day.\n They took the kids to the beach in the morning, and to the Grand Gala\n\nat the National Stadium in the evening.\n Took the kids to an aunt in the night before driving to Sunsplash\'s\n\nBeach Party. \n\n  Tuesday morning they both decided they deserved a day off from\n\nwork \x13 an easy enough act, as he was a managing director and she was a\n\nvice-president and long- time best friend of the CEO\'s wife, and they rarely\n\never took days off or vacations; still they both phoned in sick.\n homes, they\n\nsat in bed sipping coffee the helper brought them.\n ( Their helper worked normal 8-4 work- week hours).\n They had had a wonderful night out, were bright-eyed as they usually\n\nwere during Sunsplash week.\n The helper served them breakfast in bed.\n Half-way through breakfast it hit Ava that Reggae Sunsplash week,\n\nIndependence Carnival Week and Christmas were the only times she and her\n\nhusband had spent a lot of time together in the last six years, the only\n\ntimes they had fun, good sex and long talks: this breakfast in bed was the\n\nfirst in many years.\n She saw that it was all an odd and a sad fact, seeing that at such\n\ntimes they spent most of their nights dancing and had to go to work most\n\ndays. \n\n  Yes, she mused, for the last five to six years Reggae Sunsplash,\n\nCarnival, Independence weekend and Christmas were the only times she and her\n\nhusband were truly together.\n They hadn\'t even had a vacation in the past five years, always too\n\nbusy chasing their career goals, obsessed with making it to the  \'top\n\n before they reached fifty.\n , anyway?\n &Christ, they were allowing greed to kill their love and marriage.\n\n\n  Mr. Mills put down his cup with a bang.\n " Christ, Ava darling, what have we become?\n Since Saturday I\'ve been feeling that there is a weak spot in our\n\nlife.\n I am now seeing that we\'ve become so taken up in our careers and our\n\ngoals that we have not been spending much time together&"  \n\n  " Except for during Sunsplash, Independence, Carnival and\n\nChristmas,"  she injected.\n " Since Saturday I, too, have been searching for the weakness\n\nin our marriage."  \n\n  His eyes bulged with love and respect.\n\n He shook his head in self-disgust.\n What kind of man have I become, what do I really know about\n\nour kids, what have I taken time to teach them?\n\n\n \n\n  \'in the interest of\n\nour careers\'  ."  \n\n  " We hardly ever talk, and when was the last time we had\n\nlunch together during the week?"  \n\n  She chuckled bitterly, hating the picture they\'d become.\n " When our love and our children and humanity were the\n\ncentre of our lives we used to lunch together at least twice during the work\n\nweek, although our offices were miles apart then.\n For the past five to six years our offices are less than half-mile\n\napart, and in that time we have stopped lunching together regularly.\n\n\nour bosses and big clients."  \n\n  He held her lovely hand.\n\n\n  she said.\n " If we don\'t lose our love and our kids, and someday be\n\nbitter, empty old-heads unable to enjoy our  \'great wealth\'  ."\n\n \n\n  " Even if it means that I\'ll never be a chairman or own\n\nmy own  \'big\'  business, I shall give more time, energy and\n\nthought to us and the kids from this day on."  \n\n  " I see that I do have the time to lunch with you at\n\nleast twice each week, even if it means we\'ll lunch at your desk or mine."\n\n \n\n \n\n  " So long since I\'ve kissed you in your office or mine."\n\n\n She grinned.\n ( He rolled his eyes).\n \'court\'\n\n our bosses."  \n\n  \'seen\'\n\n .\n And no more passing up our vacation times.\n\n\n  She nodded.\n\n\n  " Return to those naughty games we used to play."\n\n\n\n\n  She returned his wink.\n " We should be able to come up with some new ones, too."\n\n \n\n  " Definitely.

"\n\n\n\n\n  " I\'ve been to my relatives in Portland."\n\n\n With arms locked together, Janet and Rambo disappeared in the now dis\n\n<l> persing crowd, leaving her mangoes behind on the sandy beach.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  A small guard with a huge German Shepherd on a leash barred my\n\nway into the supermarket. \n\n  I told him.\n\n\n\n \n\n  I said.\n\n\n \n He dragged the dog away.\n\n\n  I said.\n \'He\'ll bite if you order him to; or if he smells fear.\n\n\n  I patted the dog\'s head and its tail twitched, a mere suggestion\n\nof a wag.\n The guard looked at me incredulously.\n\n\n \n\n  He glanced behind him into the supermarket, then back at me.\n\n\n \n\n  He scratched his head.\n\n\n  \'Allow me to go and find out for myself, officer.\n The manager knows me and usually keeps back a few scarce items in\n\nthe storeroom for me.\n\n\n  he echoed.\n Clearly didn\'t know me.\n\n\n  I told him who I was, or rather who my husband was.\n\n\n  \'Well, try yu luck, Mrs Gregory.\n But ah don\'t tink yu can get pass dem women inside just now.\n\n\n \n\n  The little man nodded.\n \'Is only police can control dem women when dem start gwaan\n\nlike \x13 like \x13 animals.\'  \n\n \n\n  He shrugged.\n \'Dem tink the manager hoarding scarce goods in de storeroom,\n\nFlour, an rice, an soap.\n\n\n  \'I\'m sure the manager bought whatever goods he has with\n\nhard- earned cash,\'  I said.\n \'They\'re his, and he\'s entitled to do whatever he wants with\n\nthem.\n I\'ll bet if their neighbours tried to break down their walls to get\n\ntheir goods they\'d be extremely annoyed.\'  \n\n  I went inside and walked over to the manager, a pleasant,\n\nwell- dressed Chinese gentleman of about forty \x13 a second-generation\n\nJamaican.\n From the little elevated cubicle that served as his office, he was\n\nwatching \x13 with typical Chinese inscrutability \x13 the dozen or so women who\n\nwere yelling at the top of their voices while they beat against the\n\nstoreroom\'s drawn steel shutter. \n\n  I said.\n \'I\'m sorry about this little trouble you\'re having.\'\n\n \n\n  he said.\n\n\n  \'the\n\none thing that\'s wrong with this country is that it\'s overpopulated.\'\n\n \n\n  He glanced at me briefly, then back at the howling pack of\n\nwomen.\n They weren\'t harming the shutter, but I suspected he was\n\nworried about them turning to the goods on the shelves. \n\n \n\n\n  \'Sure.\n You have a big supermarket here.\n If you didn\'t have so many hungry-belly creatures to cater to - \'\n\n I indicated the mob  \' - and their hungry-belly offspring,\n\nthe goods you store here would be quite adequate.\'  \n\n  He glanced at me again.\n Inscrutably.\n\n\n  \'your\n\ngoods are only scarce because so many people want them.\'  \n\n  He smiled.\n You may be right.\n\n\n  I said.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'e4985af8-2c09-4c5d-8bfc-309595936a9e', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.509884+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9862896800041199, 'non_english_score': 0.013710319995880127}
{'text': 'The Lady of the house sucked her teeth angrily as she put down the\n\ntelephone. \n\n  " Carl knows I can\'t stand driving down to his factory,"\n\n she complained loudly. \n\n  " Why doesn\'t he just send the driver for the car!"\n\n\n She gestured in annoyance.\n\n\n  The maid dusting the furniture nearby didn\'t comment as she knew\n\nher place better than that.\n\n\n  the\n\nLady ordered, suddenly turning her annoyance on the maid.\n " Yesterday I ran my finger over the TV up there.\n Absolutely filthy!\n Don\'t know why it\'s so difficult to get you people to do an honest\n\nday\'s work."  \n\n  Carl had absolutely ruined her day, the Lady pouted.\n She would be late for the session with the girls and miss all the\n\nnice gossip.\n Furthermore Carl knew that she hated driving through the section of\n\nthe city where he worked.\n So much violence, and all those people glaring at her in hostility as\n\nif she were personally responsible for the squalor in which they lived.\n Like wild animals some of them with their uncombed heads and crazy\n\ntalk.\n Watching her as if any minute they would attack.\n No wonder the papers were always full of horrible stories about them.\n Now she wouldn\'t even have time to do her nails and she had so wanted\n\nto show off the new shade Sylvia had brought back from Miami for her.\n\n\n  Quarrelling with the maid, the gardener, and the two Alsatians\n\nblocking her path to the car, she gathered her purse and her keys and got\n\ninto the sleek black Status Symbol which had been resting in the double\n\ncarport. \n\n  The 4.3 liter, V8 engine sprang alive and settled into a smooth\n\npurr before she eased into reverse, turned it around, and put it into drive\n\nto make the long trip from home on the hilltop to workplace by the seashore.\n It gathered speed as she rolled down the hill, and, as always, she\n\nfelt a tiny moment of panic at the strength of the horsepower growling softly\n\nunder the bonnet, controlled only by the swift movement of foot from\n\naccelerator to brake as necessary.\n Carl had promised her this car if ever he was able to buy a newer\n\none, but since 1972, no new models had been allowed into the island so she\n\nhad to be content with the Mazda, which didn\'t satisfy her vanity half as\n\nmuch as the Status Symbol did. \n\n  Annoyance returned sharply as she imagined how the girls would\n\nhave exclaimed when she drove up in the Benz. \n\n  " Eh!\n Eh!\n they would\n\ntease.\n And she would explain that the Mazda was in the garage so she had to\n\nborrow the Benz, pretending with them that it was these great big problems\n\nwhich made life so difficult.\n Then they would settle down to a nice chat about the Number of Things\n\nthey were having to do without!\n And Who had just gone, or Who had decided to!\n And pass a pleasant hour or so laughing at the kinds of things some\n\npeople were packing into trailers.\n And had they heard that Jonesie was working in a shoe store in Miami\n\nas a sales clerk!\n No!\n God forbid!\n And my dearing, and oh dearing each other, they would with large eyes\n\ncontemplate life in the  in Jamaica, each realizing, but not\n\nsaying that they did not know how to come to grips with it. \n\n  As the Lady skirted the Sealand trailer parked at the foot of the\n\nhill, she remembered that she wanted to renew her campaign to get Carl to\n\nmigrate.\n After all he could even pack the factory machinery in the trailer,\n\nshe thought, and they could relocate in Florida.\n Lots of other people were doing it.\n Things were really getting impossible.\n Imagine, not even tampons in the shops.\n Good thing she knew many people who were still commuting between\n\nAmerica and Jamaica, so she could get a ready supply of the things she\n\nabsolutely couldn\'t do without. \n\n  As she passed through Half-Way-Tree, the Lady collected her\n\nwandering thoughts.\n She would need all her concentration to get safely through the\n\ncongested parts of the city she would soon be entering.\n Just last week a friend of theirs had been pulled from his car and\n\nsavagely beaten because he had scraped somebody\'s motorcycle with the car.\n\n\n\n  She made sure all the doors were locked, touched the power button\n\nfor the windows, and turned on the air conditioning.\n She was always grateful for the ability to lock up herself in the\n\ncar.\n Lock out the stenches of gutters and overcrowded human flesh.\n Lock out the sounds of human distress.\n From the cool, slight dimness of the red interior of the Status\n\nSymbol, even the sight of distress took on a sort of unreal appearance, so\n\nshe could pass through uncontaminated. \n\n  A little past Half-Way-Tree, she hesitated a moment before\n\ndeciding to turn down Maxfield Avenue.\n She hated cutting across Spanish Town Road, but this way was shorter,\n\nand Carl had said to hurry.\n That was why he hadn\'t sent somebody for the car.\n The double journey would take too long.\n She had wasted enough time already, so she would have to hurry.\n She was afraid of Carl\'s bad temper.\n He would lash out at her even in front of the factory staff if he was\n\nsufficiently annoyed.\n She was sure it wasn\'t all that important for him to get the car.\n Probably some luncheon or other for which he needed the Status Symbol\n\nto impress somebody.\n He wouldn\'t dream of driving one of the small company cars.\n Not him.\n\n\n  By the time she reached the first set of lights, the traffic had\n\nalready begun to crawl.\n Not much use her ability to move from 0 to 60 miles per hour in ten\n\nseconds flat, here.\n Not much use all that horsepower impatiently ticking under her\n\nrestraining foot.\n\n\n  As she waited for the green light, the billboard on top of the\n\nshop at the corner caught her eye;  " LIFE IS A MUTUAL AFFAIR,"\n\n it read.\n Somebody ought to tell Carl that.\n Instead of dragging her through this horrid part of town he should be\n\nprotecting her.\n\n\n  She spent a moment indulging her overactive imagination, seeing\n\nher blood- splattered breast and she leaning back as still as she had seen a\n\nbody in some film or other.\n The impatient horn behind her made her suddenly realize that the\n\nlights had changed. \n\n  She moved off quickly, smiling at her melodramatic thoughts.\n Actually she wasn\'t feeling too afraid.\n After all, didn\'t Carl do this trip every day?\n\n\n  That group of people milling around outside that shop, for\n\ninstance, she couldn\'t see what was creating the excitement and since she\n\ncouldn\'t hear either, what did it matter?\n They were like puppets in a silent movie.\n In fact she could not decide what they were doing.\n\n\n  Christ!\n Her imagination!\n She really must do something about it, she thought.\n Wonder if she was getting off.\n Lots of people getting crazy these days, because of all the stress\n\nand strain, she\'d heard.\n They were probably just fassing in somebody\'s business as usual, idle\n\nbitches that they were.\n Look at those on that other piazza.\n Winding up themselves and gyrating to some beat loud enough to\n\npenetrate her castle of silence.\n That\'s all they were good for.\n And those others milling around the betting shop, race forms in hand.\n How could the country progress with so many idlers never wanting to\n\ndo any work?\n And even those who said they worked couldn\'t do a thing.\n Her annoyance deepened as she thought how she couldn\'t get Miriam to\n\nclean the bathrooms properly.\n No amount of telling did the trick.\n No matter how often she told her what to do.\n\n\n  The traffic began to crawl again as she neared Spanish Town\n\nRoad.\n Just at the part she would have liked to pass over quickly.\n Now she had plenty of time to look out through her smoky glass at\n\nunreality. \n\n  Another billboard.\n Advertising Panther.\n Good-looking youth, she thought.\n Not like the dirty bums cotching up the walls, the lampposts, and\n\nany fence strong enough to bear their weight.\n The Panther boy looked like somebody who would care about life and\n\nnot spawn too many children.\n But what did he have to do with these dirty creatures passing as men\n\naround the place?\n Giving all those worthless women thousands of children by the\n\nminute.\n Silly ad, she thought.\n\n\n  Ah!\n There was her favorite on the other side.\n Beautiful clouds and a jet taking off into the sunset \x13 FASTEST WAY\n\nTO CANADA \x13 She liked to think about that.\n Escape from the closing-in feeling of Jamaica.\n It was only a matter of time, her friends were saying, before all of\n\nKingston and St. Andrew looked like these dumps around her.\n Zinc fences hiding poverty and nastiness, hate and crime.\n Smells she could only imagine now.\n People living, no, not living, existing on top of each other.\n God forbid that she should ever live like that.\n That she should even live close to this.\n\n\n  Suddenly she realized that none of the cars was moving, neither\n\nup nor down, and that there was an unusual amount of people on the streets\n\neven for this crowded area. \n\n \n\n  Then she noticed the driver in front of her turning up his car\n\nwindows in haste, seconds before she saw the first part of the crowd running\n\nbetween the cars.\n\n\n  Oh God!\n She prayed softly.\n Had it finally happened?\n Were they going to get her?\n Stories she had heard about riots and those who got caught in them\n\nraced through her thoughts. \n\n  But even in her panic she still felt fairly safe.\n Wasn\'t she protected in her air- conditioned car?\n People were swarming around like the cartoon figures on Spider Man,\n\nthe TV show her children were always watching.\n And she was looking on at the action, as if she were in a drive-in\n\nmovie, with a larger-than-life screen surrounding her.\n But even as she watched, the sounds of their distress began to\n\nfilter into her castle. \n\n  She wondered what was happening, but dared not open her window\n\nto find out.\n To do that would be to let reality which would force her to think\n\nand act.\n Better to stay locked up in the car and hope that whatever it was\n\nwould allow her to get moving soon. \n\n  In the distance she saw something like a wisp of smoke and\n\nthought perhaps it might be a fire.\n But why would the people be running away from it?\n\n\n  And even as she noticed their fright it turned to anger right\n\nbefore her eyes.\n One minute they were running away from something, wave after wave of\n\nthem.\n The next, like a freeze in a movie, a pause, long enough to allow\n\nanger to replace fright.\n A turn around.\n\n\n  She could tell by the shape of their mouths that they were\n\nangry.\n\n\n  From nowhere, it seemed, sticks, stones, and bottles appeared\n\nand began to fly around. \n\n  The car, she panicked.\n They would scratch the car, and what would Carl say?\n That the damn ducoman wouldn\'t match the shade and he would have to\n\ndo over the whole car \x13 if there was any duco available?\n Funny how Carl\'s anger about a scratched car was more real to her\n\nthan the anger of the mass of people milling around about her, getting hurt,\n\nhurting and going mad with anger for what reason she didn\'t even know.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL',

so it seems now, at\n\nthis distance.\n The lace trim around the necks of the nighties was not pink; it was\n\nyellowed and frazzled, practically absent.\n Thin wisps of thread which had once formed flowers, birds, a spider\'s\n\nweb.\n Years of washing in hard water with brown soap had made the nighties\n\nloose, droop, so that Charlotte\'s huge breasts slid outside, suddenly,\n\nsideways, pink falling on pink like ladylike camouflage, but for her livid\n\nnipples.\n\n\n  Her hair stuck flat against her head, bobbed and straightened,\n\ngirlish bangs as if painted on her forehead.\n Once she had resembled Louise Brooks.\n No longer.\n\n\n  Charlotte was also given to drinking vast amounts of water from\n\nthe crystal carafes standing on her low bedside table, next to her \n\nInformation Please Almanac  - she had a fetish for detail but no taste\n\nfor reading \x13 linen hankies scented with bay rum, and a bowl of soursweet\n\ntamarind balls.\n As she drank, so did she piss, ringing changes on the walls of\n\nchamber pots lined under the bed, all through the day and night.\n Her room, her pink expanse, smelled of urine and bay rum and the wet\n\nsugar which bound the tamarind balls.\n\n\n  I was to call her Aunt Charlotte and to mind her, for she was\n\nofficially  in loco parentis.  \n\n  The Cuban, Juan Antonio Corona y Mestee, slept on a safari cot\n\nnext to his ham radio, rum bottle, stacks of  Punch, Country Life  ,\n\nand something called  Gent  .\n His room was a screened-in porch at the side of the veranda.\n Sitting there with him in the evening, listening to the calls of the\n\nradio, I could almost imagine myself away from that place, in the bush\n\nawaiting capture, or rescue, until the sharp  PING!  of Charlotte\'s\n\nwater cut across even my imaginings and the scratch of faraway voices. \n\n  One night a young man vaulted the rail of a cruise ship off\n\nTobago and we picked up the distress call.\n\n\nand the young man slipped under the waves. \n\n  I have never been able to forget him, and capture him in a snap\n\nof that room, as though he floated through it, me.\n I wonder still why that particular instant?\n That warm evening, the Southern Cross in clear view?\n\n\n  His mother told the captain they had been playing bridge with\n\nanother couple when her son excused himself.\n We heard all this on the radio, as the captain reported in full.\n The Lady Eve\n\n , with Barbara Stanwyck.\n But that was blackjack, not bridge, and a screwball comedy besides.\n\n\n\n  Perhaps the young man had tired of the coupling.\n\n\n  The Cuban was a tall handsome man with blue-black hair and a\n\ncostume of unvarying khaki.\n He seemed content to stay with Charlotte, use the whores in Raetown\n\nfrom time to time, listen to his radio, sip his rum, leaf through his\n\nmagazines.\n Sitting on the side of the safari cot in his khaki, engaged in his\n\npastimes, he seemed like a displaced white hunter ( except he wasn\'t white, a\n\nfact no amount of relaxers or wide- brimmed hats could mask) or a mercenary\n\nrecuperating from battle fatigue, awaiting further orders. \n\n  Perhaps he did not stir for practical reasons.\n This was 1960; he could not return to Cuba in all his hyphenated\n\nsplendor, and had no marketable skills for the British Crown Colony in which\n\nhe found himself.\n I got along with him, knowing we were both there on sufferance,\n\nunrelated dependants.\n Me, because Charlotte owed my grandmother something, he, for whatever\n\nreason he or she might have. \n\n  One of Juan Antonio\'s duties was to drop me at school.\n Each morning he pressed a half-crown into my hand, always telling me\n\nto treat my friends.\n I appreciated his largesse, knowing the money came from his\n\nallowance.\n It was a generous act and he asked no repayment but one small thing:\n I was to tell anyone who asked that he was my father.\n As I remember, no one ever did.\n " Goodbye, Pap&agrave; "\n\n - with the accent on the last syllable \x13 when I left the car each\n\nmorning.\n I hesitated, curious.\n and the subject was not\n\nbrought up again. \n\n  I broke the chain of generosity and kept his money for myself,\n\nnot willing to share it with girls who took every chance to ridicule my\n\nAmerican accent and call me  " salt."  \n\n  I used the money to escape them, escape school.\n Sitting in the movies, watching them over and over until it was time\n\nto catch the bus back. \n\n  Charlotte was a woman of property.\n Her small house was a cliché of colonialism, graced with\n\ncalendars advertising the coronation of ER II, the marriage of Princess\n\nMargaret Rose, the visit of Alice, Princess Royal.\n Bamboo and wicker furniture was sparsely scattered across dark\n\nmahogany floors \x13 settee there, end table here \x13 giving the place the air of\n\na hotel lobby, the sort of hotel carved from the shell of a great house,\n\nbefore Hilton and Sheraton made landfall.\n Tortoise-shell lampshades.\n Ashtrays made from coconut husks.\n\n\n  The house sat on top of a hill in Kingston, surrounded by an\n\nunkempt estate \x13 so unkempt as to be arrogant, for this was the wealthiest\n\npart of the city, and the largest single tract of land.\n So large that a dead quiet enveloped the place in the evening, and we\n\nwere cut off, sound and light absorbed by the space and the dark and the\n\ntrees, abandoned and wild, entangled by vines and choked by underbrush,\n\nescaped, each reaching to survive. \n\n  At the foot of the hill was a cement gully which bordered the\n\nproperty \x13 an empty moat but for the detritus of trespassers.\n Stray dogs roamed amid Red Stripe beer bottles, crushed cigarette\n\npackets, bully-beef tins. \n\n  Trespassers, real and imagined, were Charlotte\'s passion.\n In the evening, after dinner, bed jacket draped across her shoulders\n\nagainst the soft trade winds, which she said were laden with typhoid, she\n\nroused herself to the veranda and took aim.\n She fired and fired and fired.\n Then she excused herself.\n\n She was at once terrified of invasion and confident she could stay\n\nit.\n\n\n  There was, of course, someone responsible for cleaning the house,\n\nfeeding the animals, filling the carafes and emptying the chamber pots,\n\ncooking the meals and doing the laundry.\n These tasks fell to Columba, a fourteen-year-old from St. Ann, where\n\nCharlotte had bartered him from his mother; a case of condensed milk, two\n\ndozen tins of sardines, five pounds of flour, several bottles of cooking oil,\n\npermission to squat on Charlotte\'s cane-piece \x13 fair exchange.\n His mother set up housekeeping with his brothers and sisters, and\n\nColumba was transported in the back of Charlotte\'s black Austin to Kingston.\n A more magnanimous, at least practical, landowner would have had a\n\nstaff of two, even three, but Charlotte swore against being taken advantage\n\nof, as she termed it, so all was done by Columba, learning to expand his\n\nskills under her teaching, instructions shouted from the bed. \n\n  He had been named not for our discoverer, but for the saint\n\nburied on Iona, discoverer of the monster in the loch.\n A Father Pierre, come to St. Ann from French Guiana, had taught Colum\n\n<l> ba\'s mother, Winsome, to write her name, read a ballot, and know God.\n He said he had been assistant to the confessor on Devil\'s Island, and\n\nwhen the place was finally shut down in 1951 he was cast adrift, floating\n\naround the islands seeking a berth. \n\n  His word was good enough for the people gathered in his seaside\n\nchapel of open sides and thatched roof, used during the week to shelter a\n\nwoman smashing limestone for the road, sorting trilobite-form rock.\n On Sunday morning people sang, faces misted by spray, air heavy with\n\nthe scent of sea grapes, the fat purple bunches bowing, swinging, brushing\n\nthe glass sand, bruised.\n Bruises releasing more scent, entering the throats of a congregation\n\nfighting the smash of the sea.\n On Sunday morning Father Pierre talked to them of God, dredging his\n\nmemory for every tale he had been told. \n\n  This was good enough for these people.\n They probably couldn\'t tell a confessor from a convict \x13 which is\n\nwhat Father Pierre was \x13 working off his crime against nature by boiling the\n\nlike out of yam and taro and salted beef for the wardens, his keepers. \n\n  had broadcast the real story,\n\nthe congregation stood fast: he was white; he knew God \x13 they reasoned.\n\n\n  Father Pierre held Columba\'s hand at the boy\'s baptism.\n He was ten years old then and had been called " " Junior"\n\n" all his life.\n Why honor an un- named sire?\n Father Pierre spoke to Winsome.\n " the\n\nchildren become their name." \n\n\n  What Father Pierre failed to reckon with was the unfamiliar\n\nnature of the boy\'s new name; Columba was  " Collie"  to some,\n\n " Like one damn dawg,"  his mother said.\n " Chuh, man. Hignorant smaddy cyaan accept not\'ing new."\n\n\n\n\n  , because she\n\ninsisted on Anglicization.\n It was for his own good, she added for emphasis, and so he would\n\nrecognize her kindness.\n His name-as-is was foolish and feminine and had been given him by a\n\n pedophile  , for heaven\'s sake.\n Charlotte\'s shouts reached Columba in the kitchen.\n He was attempting to put together gooseberry fool for the mistress\'s\n\nelevenses.\n smacked the stucco of the corridor\n\nbetween them, each syllable distinct, perversion bouncing furiously off the\n\nwalls.\n I heard \x13 who hadn\'t? \x13 but the word was beyond me.\n\n\n  I softly asked Juan Antonio and he, in equally hushed tones,\n\nsaid,  " Mariposa &dotted-line; butterfly."  \n\n  Charlotte wasn\'t through.\n " Fancy naming a boy after a bird.\n A black boy after a white bird.\n And still people attend that man. &dotted- line;\n she promised.\n\n\n\n  I was forbidden to speak with Columba except on matters of\n\nhousehold business, encouraged by Charlotte to complain when the pleat of my\n\nschool tunic was not sharp enough.\n I felt only awkward that a boy two years older than myself was\n\nresponsible for my laundry, for feeding me, for making my bed.\n I was, after all, an American now, only here temporarily.\n\n\n  I sought him out in secret.\n When Juan Antonio went downtown and while Charlotte dozed, the\n\ncoast was clear.\n We sat behind the house under an ancient guava, concealed by a\n\nscreen of bougainvillea.\n There we talked.\n Compared lives.\n Exchanged histories.\n We kept each other company, and our need for company made our\n\nconversations almost natural.\n The alternative was a dreadful loneliness; silence, but for the\n\nnoises of the two adults.\n\n\n  His questions about America were endless.\n What was New York like?\n Had I been to Hollywood?\n He wanted to know every detail about Duke Ellington, Marilyn Monroe,\n\nStagger Lee, Jackie Wilson, Ava Gardner, Billy the Kid, Dinah Washington,\n\nTony Curtis, Spartacus, John Wayne.\n Everyone, every name he knew from the cinema, where he slipped on\n\nhis evening off; every voice, ballad, beat, he heard over Rediffusion, tuned\n\nlow in the kitchen.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '4147dd07-0eaf-49dd-b35a-27321c202522', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.512269+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9839493632316589, 'non_english_score': 0.016050636768341064}
{'text': 'I was thirteen.\n I sat for an exam that lasted three days.\n It was strenuous, almost frightening, but I was glad my brain, void\n\nfrom cramming, was free to watch undistracted the days drag by until I would\n\nleave with Miss Odel.\n I had been too preoccupied to notice that Pa was quiet and had stopped\n\neating. \n\n  Earlier, many times an idea came racing to my head that I could\n\nhave invited Miss Odel to meet Pa \x13 they had a lot in common.\n Both were foreigners, spoke Spanish, spoke unlike the villagers.\n They could have been each other\'s audience, but I felt terribly\n\nfearful of her seeing my situation \x13 Pa\'s age, his one leg, the dilapidated\n\none-room house, the filthy babies Ma watched, Ma\'s dirty clothes.\n Now I wasn\'t sure if Pa listened.\n\n\nered from villagers, that he was preoccupied, that his thoughts flashed\n\nacross the waters, and I figured it was no pleasure for him to recall how he\n\nhad prospered in his earlier years.\n He had no money, but he did have respect.\n He had never been to school, yet he once wrote articles for a local\n\nnewspaper.\n He had taken up the preaching business and had done remarkably well.\n He worked with fine colleagues.\n His success had no limit.\n He had the power to marry virtually any woman, and he did marry a\n\nwhite woman.\n Then that foot got wounded in war.\n His career ended.\n Too haughty, he left his wife with his veteran benefits and took off\n\nwithout a trace.\n Here, he settled in a strange village with a wife and six children,\n\nand he seems to be a seventh child himself.\n Some times I reasoned Pa cracked a joke; other times I was certain\n\nhis lamp went out and his night remained thick with blackness.\n " De ole man done lost his mind; de ole\n\nman is senile." \n Whatever was the matter with the old man had me restless and\n\nconfused. \n\n  Pa continued his odd ways and progressively grew worse.\n One afternoon when I was returning home with a new undershirt\n\nfor him, a curious darkening appeared in the sky.\n Soon the calm rain fell steadily, and I listened to other youngsters\n\nscreaming, getting drenched, while I, in no hurry to get home and in fear of\n\ngetting Pa\'s undershirt wet, sheltered at the  shop.\n The shop had a half-faintish smell of white rum, salt fish, salt\n\npork, kerosene oil, and Miss Iris\'s cooking all rolled into one. \n\n  Mass Edwin craned his neck, looked up at the emptying clouds, and\n\nspoke as if to God.\n bless de\n\n dis night,"  he grinned, his hash-brown teeth blending\n\nwith his dirty face,  " look like we is in  some heavy\n\nrain dis  ,  I will be up at de crack \n\ndawn  me few hole  garden bean."  \n\n  Mass Harold sent spittle flying on my\n\narm,  " my few head  cattle will be in tip-top shape  market   ."  \n\n  Sparrow said\n\nwryly,  " is jes to gets home to my baby.\n my shoulder,\n\n I plays in her hair  sings:   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  dry up my\n\ntear\n\n  Laughter shook the shop.\n I like Sparrow.\n He was like a village joker, good at singing folk songs accompanied\n\nby his banjo.\n He could say anything about any well-to-do villager and get\n\naway with it because they claimed,  " Sparrow lost a screw." \n\n\n\n  The rain held off.\n Mr. Frankweilder and his work crew drove up \x13 he was the well-to-do\n\nfellow who set his bad dogs on us village children when we fetched firewood\n\nfrom his property.\n Fearful, I stuffed Pa\'s undershirt into my frock front and\n\nbolted home.\n I am not sure why I am including this shop scene \x13 maybe back then I\n\nwas running away from home, and maybe today I am using this scene as a way to\n\npostpone what I really want to say. \n\n  It was dark when I pushed open the unlocked door.\n It creaked, and a stench greeted me.\n I hopped out of my half wet frock and watched Pa.\n His body was bare, skinny, and languid.\n He had become unbearable since his mind had been affected.\n When he wasn\'t crawling on his hands and knees to nearby woods, he\n\nwas scratching and clawing as though a demon were inside him struggling to be\n\nreleased.\n His behavior had put a terrible strain on Ma, but with the patience\n\nof a saint she bathed, dressed, and fed Pa.\n With homemade remedies, she tried fruitlessly to restore the old\n\nman\'s youth; uncomplaining, she carried out her routine, forgetting her\n\nanxieties in nursing him. \n\n  Over the flickering flame of our kerosene lamp with a smokey\n\nwick, I tried to engross myself in reading a Nancy Drew mystery and went to\n\nbed long past midnight.\n I was restless though, for there was something unsettling and even\n\nforeboding about falling asleep in an uncomfortable position in the crowded\n\nroom.\n My space at the front of the smaller bed hardly afforded me room to\n\nlie on my side. \n\n  Across on the other bed Pa couldn\'t sleep either.\n We both stared intently at the ceiling, maybe each awake for\n\ndifferent reasons.\n I dozed for awhile, but suddenly I felt some mushy stuff falling on\n\nme.\n The heavy wetness was falling all over me and my Nancy Drew book.\n I grabbed a handful and realized Pa was tossing his feces straight\n\nat me.\n He emptied his bowels, and, bit by bit, he threw chunks of wet feces\n\nall over me.\n I leaped up, crouched under the bed to gain shelter from the\n\nbarrage, and as tears stung my eyes, I whispered to Jesus on the wall:\n\n\n\n  What Pa did to me that night continued to haunt me; I thought it\n\nwould explode my brain.\n But now, after twenty-eight years I am still asking myself whether\n\nPa\'s feces were a symbol of expressing the bond that had existed between us.\n Could it be that even in his senility, he continued to love me, his\n\n " baby"  ? \n\n  Later that evening, Pa, in the night shirt I picked up at the\n\ndressmaker, sat cushioned against a pillow, motionless and unreachable, gaunt\n\neyes peering at nothing.\n His new shirt was torn, shredded \x13 the old-time tinsmith was\n\nbeaten.\n Lines from Shakespeare were gone.\n Intellect was useless.\n I watched tearfully as Ma held his bony fingers, trembling, and\n\nbrought a mug of water to his lips, which were white at the corners.\n I watched Pa wait to die and wondered whether he indeed had let go\n\nof everything, memories of defeats and successes.\n I imagined he felt nothing: no pain, no regrets, no burden, for he\n\nseemed unattuned to anything in his world, our world.\n His body seemed too light to contain any such thoughts.\n Ninety-one years of hardship and unfulfilled expectations had\n\nreduced him to a senseless, living corpse.\n\n\n  On that hot July evening of 1962, the regular set-up crowd who\n\ncould smell death started a vigil around Pa\'s bed to watch him breathe.\n They never missed.\n\n\n  Shortly before Pa drew his last breath, Miss Cassie, a plump,\n\ncheerful lady, poured a little water in his mouth and said grimly,  "\n\nDis, my dear brodder, is to hep yuh on yuh journey into yuh lonely  ." \n She stuffed cotton up his nostrils, then, skillful as a surgeon, she\n\nclosed his mouth, and with a large piece of white cloth formed a bandage\n\nunder his chin that she tied in a knot on top of his head.\n Quickly she used a smaller piece to tie his one and a half legs\n\ntogether.\n Normally, she would have tied his two big toes.\n Several other set-uppers hastily reversed the position of his body,\n\nlaying his head at the foot of the bed to confuse any evil spirits lurking\n\naround.\n No member of his family could wash him so Miss Maggie and Miss Elita\n\nwashed his body, one starting at his toes, the other at his head, finishing\n\nwhen they reached his middle.\n pregnancy, was\n\nforbidden to look at Pa lest her baby be born looking like the corpse. \n\n  The water used to wash Pa\'s body was carefully set aside, and\n\nfamily members who desired to be protected from evil spirits were encouraged\n\nto wash their faces in it.\n I had mixed feelings.\n I wanted to be protected, but somehow I felt Pa was right.\n " The dead knows nothing, my\n\nchild; the dead can do nothing." \n This potent water was to be poured out just as Pa\'s body was on its\n\nway to the burial ground.\n Miss Katie stuck common pins into the bottom of his one foot so his\n\nghost would not come back to haunt the village.\n This precaution made no sense to me since Pa could not walk when he\n\nwas alive, but I kept quiet because here traditions were strong like the\n\nstones Miss Cassie arranged in the fireplace, as durable as the iron pot she\n\nset on the stones. \n\n  Pa\'s body, shrunken into a tiny bundle of dry skin, was wrapped\n\nin a huge white sheet.\n Our tiny mirror was turned to the wall lest the image of his corpse\n\nbe reflected in it, causing more deaths in the family.\n Busy hands efficiently transformed our murky, foul-smelling shack\n\ninto a clean, faint-smelling abode.\n When everything was in order, Miss Katie stood on our half-broken\n\ndoorstep and with two sharp shrills and one prolonged holler summoned the\n\nother villagers.\n\n\n  Without orders, people assumed their duties as if directed by\n\nan unwritten code.\n Six gravediggers with a bottle torch to light the roadway headed\n\nfor one distant corner of our one-acre plot.\n Miss Cassie put bits of brambles in the fireplace, squatted, blew,\n\nand the fire a glaring yellow flame.\n Miss Katie parched coffee, and Miss Minnie, pestle in hand, beat\n\nthe coffee in the mortar.\n Miss Bell grated coconut from which she would press milk to whiten\n\nthe coffee.\n Meanwhile, Miss Pinkey, with a hurry- scurry, cut, basted, and\n\nhand-sewed red underwear for Ma so Pa\'s ghost wouldn\'t  " play with"\n\n her when it returned.\n Likewise, Miss Maizie, a thin, wiry lady, armed all children in the\n\nfamily, tying scraps of red cloth around their necks and wrists.\n I felt somewhat repulsed by all this protection business, for Pa\n\nhad said,  " People don\'t understand you, child.\n\n So I dashed into the darkness and tossed my protection into the\n\ncornfield. \n\n  Other hands gathered mugs and cans and lit a lantern.\n Romel returned with a table he had borrowed, set it in the middle\n\nof our yard, and the requiem began. \n\n  Leonard dug out his sanky from his goatskin bag and started the\n\ntracking:   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Now with the coffee parched, beaten, and brewed, women with\n\nheads tied in plaid bandanas reminisced over Pa. \n\n \n\n Cassie asked grimly, shaking her head.\n gone tomorrow.\n is jes only\n\none single  ."  \n\n \n Miss Katie spoke as if speaking to the corpse.\n " Yo takes care of t\'ings up dere and till I come to join\n\nyo,  no matter how we t\'inks we is bad  powerful, we\n\nall gots to face  ."  \n\n  Miss Louise flashed\n\na disrespectful glance at Mr. Grindley, a well-to-do,  " dat a live\n\ndog is better dan a dead lion,  if I reads my Bible  Wise King Solomon also say,  " We come here naked  we\n\nleaves here naked, can\'t takes a  to der grave \n\nwe."', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': 'f5b5871f-26af-435c-971d-d769b4825864', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.513786+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9893350005149841, 'non_english_score': 0.01066499948501587}
{'text': 'Christmas Eve came down like a silver-lined cloud and we children\n\nslept upon it in the hope of peace and comfort. \n\n  Peace and comfort was to be had at Portsea over the Christmas\n\nseason.\n Peace and comfort and food and drink and presents and the rolling\n\ncommon of tall grass and the whitewashed mango tree trunks and the fire\n\nrockets and the starlight and the peace of Grandma and Cousin Clea and\n\nsisters and brothers and uncles and aunts and Mama and Daddy and happy\n\nmemories of the past which were small in years for me, but which were real\n\nand lasting and full of joy. \n\n  At this moment there, it is time to greet friends as we come up\n\nthe hill from the loaded bus with its boxes and suitcases piled on top like\n\nso many parcels of holiday.\n At this moment in time, we greet Grandma with her red checked\n\nheadcloth super-clean starched cotton dress under which we all knew, were\n\nthree slips, a thick flannel vest and long drawers.\n At this moment in time it is time to enter the three-roomed, blue\n\nhouse on the hill and see the sideboard with its drinking glasses of blue and\n\ngreen and pink, see the fruits of the season piled on the large, round, green\n\nplate and feel the mouth water for them.\n Time to greet and meet and love and hope &dotted-line; and, where is\n\nCousin Clea?\n She don\'t come yet?\n\n\n  But there is no Christmas tree in the portico and there are no\n\ndecorations in the house yet.\n Grandma, where is Cousin Clea?\n For Cousin Clea always did those things for as long as I could\n\nremember, that was Cousin Clea\'s job and what a joy it brought us, what a\n\njoy.\n And when she sang the Christmas carols and pleaded with us to be\n\nquiet on Christmas Day to hear Mrs. Queen talk what sheer joy it was to be\n\nwith Cousin Clea.\n And when she gave her gifts of toys to us children what a joy it was\n\nto play and play with them, and with each other and be happy all the time\n\nlike the joy would fill us all to capacity and never go away. \n\n  Grandma of the sixpences for the icicle man on Sundays, Grandma\n\nof the homemade buns and the sweet yam and the gummy bammy and the gungu\n\nsoup, where is Cousin Clea?\n And then I knew my Christmas was never going to be the same.\n There was no Cousin Clea.\n No Christmas tree.\n\n\n  I joined the mob outside and dirtied my traveling clothes, got a\n\nsmack on the bottom for it and afterwards laughed mercilessly at the prank of\n\na baby cousin but there was no Cousin Clea and Christmas was never ever going\n\nto be the same. \n\n  About Cousin Clea there was strange silence.\n Tomorrow she might come but Grandma is tightlipped with a stern\n\nunhappy face about her when we ask.\n\n\n  And Christmas Eve night came with the fire rockets making a\n\nracket and the bouncing babies bawling with fright and the dogs hiding and\n\nthe whole neighborhood is in an uproar.\n Then we children, well-versed with Christmases, scream till our\n\nthroats are on fire and then we crawl into bed bleary-eyed to wait till\n\nmorning.\n But I am afraid.\n There is no Christmas tree and no Cousin Clea and we are all afraid.\n Suppose she doesn\'t come?\n What then?\n\n\n  So we sleep and Christmas morning bounces in with the cool breeze\n\nfrom across the Plowden and Spur Tree hills and Christmas morning bounces in\n\nwith the coffee black and drawn and full of sugar and this we all eat with\n\nthe sweet homemade bun from Grandma\'s bun shop.\n And I of the seven Christmases am afraid.\n What of Cousin Clea?\n Where is Cousin Clea?\n And Mama does not know and Daddy does not know and I can\'t hear God\n\ntalk so I fear to ask him. \n\n  Then the bus comes.\n There are two a day in that district of Portsea and I look down the\n\nhill and it\'s Cousin Clea.\n And my heart is full to bursting point and I am so happy I cry and I\n\nleap down hill to greet her and she comes up to greet us but there is\n\nsomething wrong.\n What is it, Cousin Clea?\n But we do not know.\n\n\n  Cousin Clea is silent.\n She touches our hands and she kisses our cheeks, but there is a\n\nsilence about her that is disturbing.\n\n\n  We move away from her touched by her silence and slowly we move\n\nup the hill.\n Has someone died?\n And I look at her clothes.\n Long-sleeved and grey- colored, her shoes black and tall and\n\nforbidding and I look at her face, as long and as sacred and as still as the\n\nmadonna in some ancient church and this is not the Cousin Clea of the\n\nChristmas trees and the laughter.\n\n\n  It is Christmas.\n I catch the looks of the adults and my fear grows and Cousin Clea\n\ndrinks mint tea and eats crackers.\n Cousin Clea retreats during the Queen\'s Message.\n She will not hear it she says.\n She has a headache and she will not hear it and a stillness comes\n\nover the house, must be ill because she does not want to hear the Queen\'s\n\nmessage on the large radio set.\n\n\n  " It\'s the religion.\n\n\n \n\n  Mrs. Queen\'s message comes over slow and crisp and precise.\n But I do not hear it.\n Cousin Clea is locked in her room, and my thoughts are with her.\n The portico looks cold without the Christmas tree.\n There are some gifts on the floor.\n After breakfast we will open them.\n\n\n  The helper comes with plates of sweet cassava and callalloo and\n\ncodfish.\n We gather around the table.\n We eat.\n\n\n  my grandmother says\n\n " because we are unclean."  \n\n  Christmas is spoilt for me.\n I long to return to my own home on the hill, away from the cousins\n\nand the aunts and uncles, away from Cousin Clea, where there is no pain.\n And the faces of all the children reflect that pain.\n Memories are long in the minds of the young and all of us are young.\n Change is strange and resisted.\n And Cousin Clea has changed.\n We do not like her grey dress with the long sleeves.\n We do not like her thick heeled black shoes and we do not like her\n\nnew holy face.\n\n\n  But she is holy now and forever different and she tells us so.\n She has been saved and baptized and changed and she tells us so.\n So we retreat.\n We leave her while she preaches and we go to the trees and we climb\n\nand we talk and we, at last, begin once more to laugh.\n But we do not forget.\n At the back of the laughter, lies the gloom.\n Cousin Clea is no more.\n Cousin Clea is new and forbidding and cold.\n\n\n  And I of the seven Christmases have just received my second doll.\n White- skinned and blue-haired, she sits in my arms and sleeps.\n\n\n  But Cousin Clea has left her room and she approaches me.\n I look up in expectancy.\n Perhaps she has been play-acting all along.\n But her eyes are angry and her face is puckered with it.\n She springs at me.\n\n\n  " don\'t play with\n\ngraven images.\n Heathen!\n\n\n  She grabs the doll and I stare at Cousin Clea as she throws it\n\nto the ground smashing the face into pieces. \n\n  Her grey face is full of anger.\n Her eyes show her new-found fear.\n The sudden twist to her mouth, is the final thrust of the knife.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n  Before that outing Ossie had never seen the sea.\n He had heard grown-ups talk about it, and they had described it as a\n\nbig deep thing made of water, which was sometimes very rough, and in which\n\npeople caught fish.\n Those descriptions, however, did not tell him very much.\n Perhaps the best description he got was from an old man who said it\n\nwas like the biggest field of cabbage one could imagine. \n\n  One year, a few weeks before Easter, a man named Mass Aston went\n\naround the district selling tickets for an outing to the beach.\n Ossie\'s father bought tickets for the three members of his family.\n Ossie had never been on an outing and began to itch all over with\n\nexcitement.\n During the days that followed, his parents had only to threaten not\n\nto take him along and he would rush to do anything they requested. \n\n  The day before the outing he got up early and completed all his\n\nchores.\n Then he bathed in the river which ran near their house.\n He regarded this river as an enormous quantity of water, and he\n\nfound it hard to believe when people told him that compared with the sea it\n\nwas almost nothing.\n They said it was just one of the hundreds of little rivers which\n\nflowed into the big rivers which in turn flowed into the sea.\n Ossie wondered about this strange thing which they said was like the\n\nsky but made of water, which had the colour of the mountains but was flat and\n\nrolling, and which was so irresistible people paid to visit it time and time\n\nagain. \n\n  Near sunset he went to the square to see what was happening\n\nthere.\n The truck in which they would be travelling had already returned\n\nfrom its daily trip to Kingston, and it was now parked at its usual spot\n\nbeside the wooden two-storey building at the northern end of the square.\n One of the sidemen was washing the cab, and two others were bent\n\nover the spare tyre and pumping air into it.\n Some of the people in the square stood around the sidemen and\n\nwatched; others were moving in and out of the shops in haste, going home to\n\nprepare food for the trip. \n\n  Ossie left the square at dusk and began running home.\n His feet were light with anticipation as he ran.\n\n\n  she\n\nshouted angrily as she shoved him away. \n\n  In the half-light he noticed that her normally pretty face was\n\ncontorted with anger, an anger too deep to be entirely the result of his\n\nbumping into her. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  She didn\'t answer and the grey form of her dress and headtie\n\nquickly disappeared around the bend. \n\n  A little further down the road he saw Caswell, her boyfriend,\n\nsitting on a bank with his head and hands bent over his knees.\n as he passed, but Caswell\n\ndid not answer. \n\n  At home his mother and one of his aunts were in the kitchen\n\npreparing food for the outing.\n Ossie went into the house and sat by the window where he could smell\n\nthe fried chicken and rice and peas, and where he could listen to the women\'s\n\nvoices while he watched the flickering of the fire behind the rows of bamboo\n\nwattling. \n\n  He slept lightly that night; he woke up at the slightest sound,\n\nand he interpreted every crowing of a cock as a sign of daylight.\n When it was finally daybreak he was sleeping soundly and had to be\n\nawakened.\n It was still dark outside, but his parents had surer ears and noses\n\nfor the sounds and smells of morning than he had.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '8eee8732-16d1-46ed-9a47-d8f8a9914960', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.514932+00:00',

{'text': "Jean was lying naked in a strange bed, wedged between a rough\n\nwooden wall and a man's body.\n The smell of tainted air and garbage mingled with the rawness of fish\n\nand seaweed.\n It overwhelmed her, making her gag until her brain adjusted to it.\n There was a stickiness between her thighs.\n That and the scent of stale sex told her what her mind could not\n\nrecall. \n\n  She felt no alarm, no shame; only resignation.\n She had even gone beyond the panic of wondering if the sex had been\n\nprotected.\n She no longer really cared about the risks.\n Her mind was emptied of any sense of responsibility.\n What did it matter anyway?\n If she was pregnant it couldn't be any worse than before.\n She already knew about being an unmarried mother living without the\n\nsecurity of a wedding ring.\n If she caught something she might die, but right now she couldn't see\n\nmuch in life to hang on for. \n\n  Who say I isn't the one passing out\n\ndisease?  she wondered, choking down a sudden urge to giggle.\n With the sin I weighted down in and the amount of time I been in\n\nthis self-same position, I can't expect to stay lucky &dotted-line; specially\n\nthe way bad luck following me all my days. \n It was as if everything was conspiring to send her down, keep her\n\ndown, and somehow it just didn't matter any more. \n\n  The man's back was turned towards her.\n It was sun-baked and dry- skinned taking on a greyish cast in the\n\nshadowed room.\n Jean's gaze took in the rough, scaly- looking elbow, before lingering\n\non the rusty-red appearance of the locks that made him seem somehow familiar.\n It didn't make her curious to find out for sure.\n None of it did.\n All she wanted was to stay here, where nothing and no one could reach\n\nher. \n\n  She hoped he wouldn't wake up.\n That she did not have to put up with his sexual attention now her\n\nmind was clear.\n Yet she just continued lying there, making no move to leave the bed\n\nand put some distance between them. \n\n  The man shifted, mumbled and turned over in his sleep.\n Jean tensed as a counterpoint to the vibration in the bed, pressing\n\nback hard against the uneven texture of the wall to avoid contact with him.\n She stared at his bearded face incuriously, not even surprised to see\n\nthat it was the rastaman from the squatted land.\n What was his name again?\n &dotted-line;\n Peter from the Tribe of\n\nAsh. \n He was a con artist, she remembered that as well.\n She knew enough real rastas to recognise a hustler when she saw one.\n But he at least accepted her for what she was, even admired her for\n\nwhat he thought she had achieved.\n She felt a brief pleasure at her feat of recall, but even that\n\npetered out, taking her back to the flat featureless state she had been in\n\nbefore. \n\n  It occurred to her that she must be in the rastaman's dilapidated\n\nwooden house.\n Several clues fell into place and that pleased her briefly too.\n No wonder she had thought the sea sounded close enough for her to\n\nstretch out her hand and bury it in the wet sand of the shoreline.\n While she drifted in and out of sleep, that had been a comforting\n\nthought.\n Like being cocooned and nurtured safe from the pain of real life.\n\n\n\n  One foot was becoming numb from lying too long at an awkward\n\nangle.\n Jean shifted experimentally, waiting to feel the usual\n\nqueasiness.\n puzzled her as well.\n Hadn't she been drinking?\n Surely she must have been to end up here.\n The prickling sensation in her foot left it feeling weak.\n She rubbed at it to get the blood circulating, idly trying to\n\nremember the events that brought her here.\n She let her mind drift backwards, grappling for a focus of recall.\n\n\n\n  - what had happened then?\n She had woken up feeling sick and depressed with the mess her life\n\nwas in.\n Hearing the children's laughter had been like a goad, a mocking\n\ncounterpoint to her depression; tantalising her with a joy she could no\n\nlonger share.\n She had only gone downstairs to ask them to keep the noise down,\n\nnothing more.\n Her brows wrinkled as she remembered Aleesa's defiance and what she\n\nsaw as her cousin's interference. \n\n  It's all well and good Sylvia talking about girlchildren\n\nhaving freedom.\n She not even a mother, and she sure as anything not going have to\n\ntake the shame when Aleesa turn rude and slack.\n Is bad enough the way Jimmy spoiling them children, but with Sylvia\n\nand George around I can't do a thing with them, not one single thing. \n She sighed, her mood tilting further into depression.\n Why can't Sylvia see I was being firm for Aleesa own good?\n Attempting to save that wilful child from the thousand and one sins\n\nof pride?\n , she\n\ndecided sadly,  I feel so loaded down with them myself, is like a\n\nfestering corpse on my back sometimes.  \n\n  A strange, desperate sort of laugh bubbled up inside her.\n Jean gulped it down and wrapped her arms around her stomach.\n She rocked back and forth in an attempt to keep the sound at bay,\n\nthen froze on a sudden thought.\n Supposing something had broken loose, some elemental malfunction\n\nsomewhere in her belly?\n She was afraid in case that strange laughter boiled over.\n What if it kept running on and running on till it emptied her\n\naltogether of the possibility of humour? \n\n  Jean shivered despite the heat.\n She fancied that all her emotions were in flimsy containers waiting\n\nfor an accident.\n She could just imagine the little goodness and all that badness\n\nspilling over and getting all mixed up.\n It caused a sudden surge of panic.\n Supposing the good drained away, leaving her with all that sin\n\nexposed? \n\n  The thought made her shift uneasily, the movement setting up a\n\nvibration in the sagging bed that woke the man.\n He blinked, once, twice, focusing on her with bloodshot eyes.\n A smile split his face, showing significant gaps between his\n\nteeth. \n\n  'Good day, Miss Jean &dotted-line;\n\n\n  Jean didn't bother to smile back, afraid to waste emotions she\n\nwas sure had started leaking away. \n\n  He lay where he was for a long time, just looking, admiration and\n\npleasure in his eyes.\n Jean stared back, feeling nothing.\n She wasn't even dismayed that he was awake, with every intention of\n\ncontinuing where he'd left off the night before. \n\n  One of the man's hands came out to rest on her stomach.\n It was a big hand, long-fingered and bony, the nails discoloured by\n\nnicotine and dirt.\n Jean lay still, neither accepting nor rejecting.\n It made him press on, fingers tugging gently at the sparse hairs that\n\ngrew between her navel and her pubic line. \n\n  Jean stared at some point far beyond him, feeling a sense of\n\nfutility.\n The gesture reminded her so much of Jimmy it brought a sting of tears\n\nto her eyes.\n She quashed those feelings down at birth, angry all of a sudden.\n Why should Jimmy matter anyway?\n , he'd made that\n\nclear enough. \n\n  , he liked her.\n His every look and gesture told her just how lucky he considered\n\nhimself to have merited her attention.\n Yes, Peter wanted her and as far as she was concerned, he could never\n\nin a hundred years reach the point where  she  wasn't good enough\n\nfor him. \n\n  That was enough to relax her tensing muscles and she didn't\n\nresist when he raised himself on one arm and urged her to lie on her back.\n But Jimmy still managed to cheat her.\n He kept intruding in her mind \x13 his loving, the conversations that\n\naccompanied it \x13 till she couldn't kid herself that this man could be a\n\nsubstitute. \n\n  Peter was a gentle kind of person even so, his hand moving over\n\nthe skin of her belly with a strange, patient insistence.\n It felt comforting, soothing to her battered spirit and she opened\n\nher legs willingly to accommodate him when he finally rolled on top of her.\n With her eyes closed tight, she could pretend Jimmy was the one that\n\nheld her, that it was his beard tickling her neck, his mouth closing warm and\n\nwet on first one breast and then the other. \n\n  The fantasy was arousing.\n Jean wrapped her legs tightly around the scrawny waist pulling him\n\ndeeper inside her.\n Her hips rocked with the urgency in him, while the fantasy image\n\ndrew a groan of satisfaction from deep inside her. \n\n  Afterwards he returned to stroking her belly, a self-satisfied\n\nsmile in his voice,  'You like me, ee?\n\n\n  Jean kept her eyes closed, feeling the let down heavily.\n The smells of poverty were suddenly oppressive, and she had to\n\nbreathe deeply to still the panicky feeling of entrapment.\n She could feel him moving about, guessed that he was getting\n\ndressed, but felt no desire to go searching for her own clothes. \n\n  The bed depressed as he came to sit beside her.\n There was the scratching and spurting sounds of a match being lit\n\nand she smelt the aroma of ganja as a spliff was thrust into her hand.\n She opened her eyes then, looking at the fat cigarette doubtfully.\n She had never messed around with drugs, but Peter was watching her\n\nexpectantly. \n\n  Jean looked at the spliff again.\n It didn't smell too bad, a bit herbal really.\n She put it to her lips on a sudden decision, inhaling deeply.\n The smoke irritated her throat, making her cough.\n Peter slapped her on the back and produced a carton of juice from\n\nsomewhere.\n Eyes watering, Jean eyed the spliff doubtfully.\n\n\n  Peter's voice egged her on,\n\n 'the thing is not to draw on it too sudden.'  \n\n  She put it to her mouth again, gingerly.\n This time she managed not to cough.\n After that it was not too hard to hold in the strange blue smoke.\n The mellow feelings were surprisingly relaxing.\n Her insides didn't seem so fragile any more.\n Jean felt good, Peter looked good.\n She smiled, thinking he was really quite handsome underneath it\n\nall. \n\n  He told her about his frustration with his life.\n She sympathised, feeling the echoes in her own.\n He had wanted to go to America, but his sister over there didn't\n\nwant to know and his one aunt in England had never answered his letters.\n He knew he could make good money from selling ganja up in foreign.\n But down here it was a hand-to- mouth business because the local\n\nmarket wasn't saying anything. \n\n  By the time she had gone through a third of her spliff she was\n\nfeeling relaxed and clear-headed.\n She couldn't imagine how she could ever have been against this\n\nthing; ever believed what she now considered foolish talk about psychosis.\n Her brain seemed to have sharpened, all the thousand and one\n\nproblems fading to insignificant specks. \n\n  She found herself telling Peter about Davian and Aleesa; how her\n\nson could barely say two words at the age of three, Aleesa's arrogance and\n\nthe way Sylvia thwarted every attempt she made to bring them up in the\n\ndisciplined ways of old Jamaica. \n\n  He listened patiently, full of sympathy and understanding.\n Why had she failed to realise just how bright he was, what a fine\n\nmind lay beneath that rough exterior?\n She listened, rapt, as he encouraged her with a mixture of scripture\n\nand his own view, finishing with the profound observation that all her\n\nsufferings would make her stronger. \n\n  'In the end is for you to follow what inside your\n\nheart,'  he suggested when she asked what she should do. \n\n  'Sylvia\n\nis just the one to get me arrested.\n You don't know how much power people like her have up in England.\n She can just come one day and take the children and next thing you\n\nhave to go up to the law court and they put you in prison for child abuse\n\n&dotted-line; just through you want grow them right.'", 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '5a7ebe7c-ea33-4bd1-bcc0-c6dea0de182b', 'added':

{'text': 'home on the southeast\n\ncoast of rural Jamaica, nestled into the foothills of the Blue Mountains\n\noverlooking the Caribbean Sea, I began  The Book of Mechtilde. \n For a long time, I had been thinking about creating a memorial of a\n\nsort to my mother.\n I was still searching for the ideal framework and direction.\n That evening, after jotting in a notebook yet another fragment of my\n\nmemory of my mother, I picked up my Bible, given to me in observance of a\n\nlong- ago rite of passage.\n A decade before, I had placed the corsage I had received that day\n\nbetween the pages of the Bible, a sentimental gestures of my early adoles <l>\n\ncent years.\n I now extracted the fragile, dried rose, crisp and crumbling with age,\n\nand put it in the bottom of the Bible\'s clothbound box.\n I lifted the ribbon marking the page, and as fate would have it, the\n\nfirst page I fingered began the Book of Job. \n\n  The idea emerged instantaneously.\n All that remained was to complete the work.\n home.\n I spent my days painting on an old wooden desk in the Schoolroom, the\n\nname given to the small freestanding concrete-block structure at the\n\nback of the house where my father and his brother had been taught by my\n\ngrandmother.\n During the evenings I would return to the house to sit at the dining\n\ntable, after my grandmother had retired to an armchair with a book or\n\nher knitting and my grandfather to his seat in front of the television.\n He would tune in to a satellite roaming the nighttime sky, and crank\n\nup the volume to capacity, ensuring immersion in otherwise only\n\nsemi-interesting programs.\n The television provided an ambience of activity.\n Otherwise, the countryside was quiet, exceedingly so, for a nation of\n\nsocial and sociable creatures, where silence resounded as discord, serenity\n\nas noise. \n\n  With the television roaring and flashing forth its eerie blue\n\nlight, I would imprint the biblical text in gold ink around each illustration\n\npainted earlier that day.\n I would glance up now and then to see my grandfather\'s head drop to\n\nhis shoulder as he dozed, then the shudder as he caught himself, cheeks\n\njostling his chins as he shook to regain a semblance of consciousness and\n\ncatch the remaining portion of the program.\n He was my company at this late hour, my human presence and solace in\n\nthe shifting shadows of the petrifying vacuum of night.\n By this time, my grandmother had already gone to bed with her\n\nshortwave radio and a book.\n When my eyes would no longer focus, and my grandfather could no\n\nlonger rouse himself from ( albeit shallow) sleep, I\'d pack my paintings,\n\nrise, and take the remote from his motionless hand.\n In the sudden ensuing silence with the TV now off, he\'d stir, enough\n\nto register this signal for bedtime.\n While I turned off the few remaining lights, he\'d shift his weight to\n\nhis feet and lift himself from his chair, then rely on the somnambulist\'s\n\nshuffle to transport him to bed. \n\n  During the next half hour each evening, before sleep overwhelmed\n\nme, I would write and revise the text to the book in a spiral-bound notebook\n\nthat has long since been lost.\n\n\ngrandparents\'  presence.\n From my bedroom, one wall away from them, I could hear the drone and\n\ncrackle of the radio, knowing I would hear it all night as my grandmother had\n\nfallen asleep with it standing on her chest, antenna upright receiving\n\nbroadcasts from all over the world.\n I could feel the vibrations of my grandfather\'s snore as he rumbled\n\nthrough the night, with seldom a lull in his nocturnal breathing.\n Then their dog would go for his fleas, snuffling after them as they\n\nhopped around in his fur, nipping his skin.\n Now and then, I painted and wrote elsewhere \x13 the book travelling\n\nwith me as a stack of images and text.\n Finally, when it was finished, I showed the illustrations and read\n\nthe words aloud to my grandmother and my aunt.\n\n\n \n\n in the Land of Jah, there lived a good woman named Mechtilde.\n This woman had one fine husband for whom she bore three daughters.\n Together, they owned a small plot of earth, upon which sat a house\n\nand a grand mango tree, amongst the oldest of trees in the Land. \n\n  Each day, under the mango tree, Mechtilde used to sit and hold\n\ncourt.\n She would invite her daughters to her side, her dogs to her feet, and\n\nher many friends to the very best chairs surrounding her. They would eat and\n\ndrink, laugh and cry, at the joy that this woman brought them. \n\n  At nightfall, all would depart and the devoted helpers of\n\nMechtilde would arrive to attend to her.\n They would wash her, change her clothing, and prepare and lay an\n\nelaborate meal before her.\n Then her beloved husband would take their place, and fulfill the\n\nperiod of visiting. \n\n  Each visit, however, weakened Mechtilde.\n In spite of the joy the visits brought her, they sacrificed her\n\nstrength, of which she had little remaining.\n For Mechtilde was ill, stricken many years before by a disease.\n This disease ate at her flesh, slowly and silently devouring her\n\nbody.\n\n\n  Until now, Mechtilde had considered herself a lucky woman.\n She had been born into a family of four brothers and four sisters,\n\nand fine parents, though of humble means.\n Her father had come from the East, bringing with him the blessings of\n\nharmony and balance.\n Her mother had come from a multitude of origins, bringing with her\n\nthe blessings of tolerance and peace.\n Together, they raised their offspring well, bestowing upon them open\n\nminds and even hearts. \n\n  Furthermore, Mechtilde had been graced with great beauty, and she\n\ntravelled far and wide to represent Jah in other nations.\n All loved her.\n Suitors, besotted by her beauty, fell at her feet.\n Women bore her no grudge, but blessed her.\n She captivated both the elderly and children, who clung to her.\n Stories were written about her, and songs were sung in her\n\nhonor. \n\n  Mechtilde lived in a land of songmakers.\n The people expressed themselves through music which, in turn, became\n\nthe heartbeat of the Land.\n In times of joy, the music rejoiced.\n In times of sorrow, the music wept.\n And Jah knew both sounds of thanksgiving and of lamentation, since\n\ntimes in the Land were tumultuous. \n\n  Jah had only recently become a nation separate from all other\n\nnations.\n The people had worked hard to gain the Land for their own.\n Most had been exiled from other lands, and knew no return.\n Bonded by exile, they grew to love Jah and claim Jah for their own.\n Others opposed them but they worked even harder and wavered not from\n\ntheir path.\n\n\ndiction of greater reward. \n\n  Jah\'s people were a superstitious people and put much faith in\n\nthe power of divination.\n Those who were bestowed with this power were mostly women who came to\n\nbe known as Wise Women.\n Through earthly deeds and practices, they foretold the future and,\n\nthrough divine inspiration, they directed people\'s lives.\n\n\n  Mechtilde was amongst those who went to visit a Wise Woman.\n The Wise Woman took her aside and gave her tea to drink.\n When Mechtilde finished drinking, she took the cup from her.\n She peered into it, then closed her eyes.\n Speaking softly, she told Mechtilde that within one week she would\n\nmeet her future husband, and within a year would marry him.\n She spoke of much joy that she saw ahead, but did not speak of the\n\nimpending sadness to which she had shut her eyes. \n\n  Mechtilde returned home filled with contentment and inner peace.\n She had hoped for a family and one was now in store for her.\n Soon, all that the Wise Woman spoke of came to pass.\n She met her future husband that week, and by year\'s end they were\n\nmarried.\n Together, they acquired their house and plot of land with the aged\n\ntree.\n Their friends were plentiful and their families prosperous.\n The tree bore in abundance and Mechtilde gave birth to three\n\ndaughters. \n\n  Then misfortune struck.\n Mechtilde discovered within her the terrible disease.\n Her health deteriorated, taking with it her womanhood.\n She fought with courage and faith, but few believed she would\n\nsurvive.\n Fearful of the knowledge of the future, she did not dare visit the\n\nWise Women of the Land.\n Instead, Mechtilde relied on the strength of her will and battled\n\nbravely with the terrible disease.\n She drew on the fortitude of her family and friends and forced the\n\ndisease into remission. \n\n  When it seemed that Mechtilde had regained good health, the\n\nfortunes of Jah took a turn for the worse.\n In the early years of the Land, two tribes had risen to prominence.\n These two tribes vied for leadership of the Land.\n Before, they had used rhetoric to win the hearts of the people.\n Now, they lifted up swords against one another and set their\n\nfollowers to war.\n Suddenly, the future of Mechtilde\'s family and friends looked grim,\n\nand those who could leave departed the Land.\n They took with them their fortitude, depleting the strength of\n\nher will. \n\n  The disease resurfaced.\n As Mechtilde\'s body began to fight the illness, the war with Jah\n\nworsened.\n Soon, the battle raged on either front.\n The invasive disease spread slowly and, like the divided\n\nfactions of Jah, destroyed area by area.\n Within little time, the destruction of the disease surpassed that of\n\nthe people of Jah and all hope left her.\n In the face of her family and her friends, she laughed much to deny\n\nher desolate future.\n She spoke only of the hopes of her country and indicated\n\nnothing of her silent tribulation. \n\n  But, in the solitude of the mango tree, she lamented her\n\nmisfortune.\n Her suffering overwhelmed her, and it was there that she cried out.\n There also that she heard the wails of her people.\n There that she begged relief from her inner turmoil and strife, and\n\nthe outer ones of the Land of Jah.\n She pleaded mercy from pain, for herself and her country, and\n\nit was there in the shade of the tree that her tears shed in multitudes like\n\nthe leaves above her. \n\n  Mechtilde could bear no more.\n She had brought joy to her husband, her family and friends.\n She had worked hard in the best interest of her people.\n Now, with her head bent to the ground, pleading that she be\n\nswallowed up, she grew weary and succumbed to the disease.\n The price had been paid for her suffering, and she left the Land for\n\nanother.\n Having bestowed upon it much more than her offspring, she then\n\nblessed it with the memory of a good name.  \n\n\n\n \n\n  Sometimes, she used to wake up and look at him lying asleep\n\nbeside her, she would prop herself up on one elbow and study his face.\n He slept like a child, knees drawn up to his stomach, both hands\n\ntucked between his thighs.\n His mouth was always slightly open when he slept, and his\n\nmouth-water always left a damp patch on the pillowcase.\n No matter how many days after, it seem the patch would always be\n\ndamp, and every time she washed it she would run her finger over the stain\n\nand her mind would pick up the signal and move back to the image of him lying\n\nasleep.\n When the radio next door began to play the first of the morning\n\nchurch services, she would know that it was time to begin to get ready to go\n\nto work.\n From Monday to Saturday, every day, her days began like this. She\n\nwould go to the kitchen to prepare his breakfast, then she would leave it\n\ncovered up on top of the stove over a bowl of hot water.\n Then she would go to the bathroom, bathe in the cold early morning\n\nwater and then get dressed.\n Just before she left she always placed some money on the top of the\n\nbureau for his rum and cigarettes, then she would say to his sleeping\n\nform,  " Frenchie, ah gone, take care till I come back."', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '9a4fe033-1cb1-4542-83f3-9ea0b8d2ee8c', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.517407+00:00', 'english_score': 0.9903735518455505, 'non_english_score': 0.009626448154449463}

pieces\n\nof ribbons at the end.\n "\n\nPicky-picky head, go buy new head."  \n\n  Friday and Saturday evenings we would play games.\n I was not very good at marbles, but I loved to watch Winnifred play\n\nwith Lloydie.\n Winnifred was good.\n We played hopscotch and jacks, but my favourites were baseball and\n\ndandy-shandy.\n Elithia liked these two games best.\n I was always eager to include Elithia, because she wasn\'t a good\n\nplayer and I would drive the ball into her back or belly, laughing wickedly\n\nwhen she bent over in pain. \n\n  Elithia was Auntie Maggie\'s only daughter.\n Her mouth was as big and loud as a petchary bird and she loved to\n\ntake news to Auntie Maggie.\n If we excluded her from a game, she would threaten to tell Auntie\n\nMaggie about something that happened weeks ago that the rest of us had long\n\nforgotten.\n We would then be banned from playing with Lloydie or from sitting on\n\nthe verandah in the evenings. \n\n \n Elithia\'s mean voice sing-songing behind my ears.\n I tried not to cry, not because I was thinking about the beating I\n\nwould get when I got home, but because I couldn\'t hit blabbermouth Elithia\n\nright where she deserved it.\n I couldn\'t even promise her, Auntie Maggie was right beside me.\n\n\n  I burned with embarrassment.\n I would have to take the bus with Auntie Maggie.\n Auntie Maggie was fat.\n Very fat.\n The few times I\'d ridden the bus with Auntie Maggie she\'d used up all\n\nof two seats.\n Everyone would stare at us.\n I loved Auntie Maggie, despite her exaggerated accounts of what\n\nI did.\n I just didn\'t like taking the bus with her.\n And today Uncle Blue, her husband, was not around to take us in his\n\ncar. \n\n  I reached the bus stop with Auntie Maggie, with Elithia\'s soppy\n\nvoice still singing in my ear.\n " No beating like dis one.\n\n\n  .\n\n\n\n  Congregational Hall School was about six miles from home, in\n\ndowntown Kingston and close to the higglers and their guava cheese and grater\n\ncakes.\n We would spend our bus fare on sweets and then beg from people at the\n\nbus stop.\n " Come buy piece a guava cheese, only\n\ntrupence!" \n " Nice girl wid de pretty ribbon, greater cake fi only a\n\ntreepence.\n\n " Paradise plums fi sale.\n\n\n  Almost every evening I spent my bus fare on one of those tempt\n\n<l> ing sweets.\n After sucking the last taste from my tongue, I would set out to get\n\nthreepence to get me home on the bus.\n Two days a week I also visited my father at his barbershop on East\n\nQueen Street, not far from Parade Station.\n Papa rarely came to our avenue and he was always glad to see me.\n\n\n" Yes man, dis is my daughter from my second marriage.\n Four from de first marriage and two little outside one.\n\n\n  The customers in turn would express their admiration.\n Then my father would give me an ice cream cone or sometimes bun and\n\ncheese.\n After eating, I would ask for threepence to pay my bus fare.\n I had to be careful about this because he was always quick to blame\n\nMama.\n " She didn\'t give yuh enough fi yuh bus fare?\n I\'ll have to come up dat avenue and have a good talk wid her."\n\n\n When Papa was in that mood I would say goodbye and head for Parade\n\nStation. \n\n  Mama knew I visited him sometimes but certainly not as often as\n\ntwice a week.\n If she\'d known I visited him to beg bus fare, she would have beat the\n\nliving daylights out of me.\n It happened before:\n " From de day dat man walk out, he never even try to find out\n\nif ah have nuff to feed you.\n Never ask about money fi school uniform and yuh gone to beg him\n\ntrupence, gal?"  \n\n  " Please m\'am, beg yuh a trupence to tek de bus home."\n\n\n " Good evening, mama.\n\n\n\n  to yuh\n\nmoney?" \n "\n\nSomeone tek it out of my school bag, m\'am." \n " What\n\ntime is it, m\'am?\n Jesus!\n Ah didn\'t know it was so late!\n Ah should have been home to pick up my little sister, poor ting.\n\n\n\n\n  I was a loner at this and if I came down to Parade with a friend\n\nfrom school, we would be very careful to do our begging in separate\n\ndirections.\n Some days I would get the threepence on my first try.\n Some days it took a long time to get the money or I would only get\n\ntwopence.\n Those evenings I walked home, always following the bus route, the\n\nlong way home, but the only one I knew.\n Walk up Parade, past the big Coronation Market, on to Spanish Town\n\nRoad, past deserted and burned-down buildings, past shacks, burial grounds,\n\nmadman, madwoman, children in tear-up clothes, on to Waltham Park Road, then\n\nfinally Chisholm Avenue and then the turn onto our little avenue. \n\n  The day I got the beating of my life was a Friday evening.\n I begged and begged at Parade but couldn\'t come up with threepence.\n I decided not to go to Papa, afraid he would accompany me home.\n That Friday I begged for hours.\n When the last lady I tried told me it was six o\'clock I knew it was\n\ntime to start walking home.\n I began the long walk, munching on my guava cheese and thinking about\n\nwhat excuse to give Mama for being so late. \n\n  " Weh yuh deh since school\n\nlet out?" \n As I opened my mouth to answer, her right hand came down on my face.\n I fell on the ground, then got to my feet quick and ran to the shed\n\nin the back of the yard.\n Mama sat waiting on the verandah.\n It was dark by then and I was hungry and frightened.\n Why didn\'t she call me or shout at me?\n I tried to slip by her into the house.\n Tamarind switch came down on my back and Mama gripped the collar of\n\nmy blouse. \n\n  " Yuh won\'t stop eat off yuh bus fare?\n street?\n me?\n\n\n  The tamarind switch danced all over my back.\n I was shaking and screaming.\n The next-door neighbours opened their windows to hear better.\n Some came to the fence to get a better look.\n Mama didn\'t let up.\n\n\n \n\n  " Well shut yuh mout.\n\n\n  Throughout all the talking, Mama did not miss a beat.\n My back was the African drum she never knew.\n I continued to scream, yelling for the police.\n This was a sign of disrespect.\n " Is show yuh want to show me up gal?\n\n\n  I don\'t remember when it ended.\n What stayed with me for a long time were the welts and cuts on my\n\nback and behind.\n\n\n  Auntie Maggie and I sat at the very back of the bus.\n " When ah done tell Lulu what yuh going on wid, yuh going to\n\nbe sorry!\n What dat yuh doing at your age, eh?\n\n\n  The whole bus load of people turned round to look at me.\n Auntie Maggie had a full house for the dress rehearsal and when we\n\ngot home she would give a perfect performance. \n\n  Soon the entire bus was taking part.\n " Yuh have to watch dem pickney nowadays.\n a red, freckle-faced woman\n\noffered. \n\n  " Yuh\n\nhear dat?\n Yuh watch yuh step.\n\n\n  " She need a good beating."\n\n \n\n  "\n\nYuh have to stop dem tings before dem reach higher proportion.\n\n\n\n  People got off the bus, new people came on.\n Auntie Maggie continued her recitation and the new people on\n\nthe bus took up the chorus. \n\n \n\nlike dat, de same womanish style.\n She now sixteen and is tree pickney she have fi tree different man."\n\n \n\n  a tall\n\nman with glasses asked. \n\n  " No not yet.\n Ah tekking her home to talk to my sister.\n\n\n\n  By now I was crying.\n The voices went on.\n her eye.\n See how dem bright.\n\n\n  More agreement.\n " Yes, especially when dem start fi cry, dat is a sure sign\n\nof badness." \n Another time I hadn\'t cried and the public complaint was that I was\n\ndried-eyed and womanish. \n\n  I had everyone\'s attention.\n Nobody was paying attention to Auntie Maggie\'s size.\n Even I forgot that Auntie Maggie took up two entire seats at the\n\nback of the bus. \n\n  the conductress called out.\n Auntie Maggie said goodbye to the crowd and pushed me to the front.\n Everybody I knew was on the street that evening.\n I put on my don\'t-talk-to-me face as I passed my friends, but that\n\ndidn\'t help. \n\n \n\n  " How come yuh Auntie holding on to yuh so tight?"\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Auntie Maggie didn\'t miss that.\n " She not coming to nobody party.\n De only party she going to is de one in her bed.\n Yuh wait till ah tell her mother what a good-for-nutting daughter\n\nshe have.\n\n\n\n\n  a fat, round-faced girl\n\nnamed Joy asked.\n My heart jumping all over my chest and sweat covering my face, I\n\nwaited for Auntie Maggie to go on and on as she had in the bus, but she\n\ndidn\'t seem to hear Joy\'s question. \n\n  " Yuh wait till yuh go home and Lulu hear about your\n\ncarrying on.\n All dis shame a little pickney like yuh bring down on yuh mother.\n\n\n  What would it be?\n Worse than the Parade beating?\n Mama\'s heavy hands?', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '75184009-261b-4bdb-ab15-cc46eacf6ca7', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.518828+00:00', 'english_score':

the\n\nroom.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n " Yuh goin to\n\nlove living in Toronto.\n Wait till yuh go to school tomorrow and start meeting new frens.\n\n Walking over to Joey\'s bed, she shook him until he woke.\n\n " Unnu nuh bodda stay in yah till\n\ndi breakfast get cold."  \n\n  Joey sat up in bed and rubbed his eyes.\n Noticing Johnny for the first time he stared at him.\n\n\n  Johnny stammered, a bit\n\nstunned at his brother\'s forwardness.\n\n\n  " I\'m six and a half.\n I\'m going to be seven in December.\n Mom told us about you.\n Dad says there\'re too many of Mom\'s family living here already.\n He says, first there was Vinette, then Aunt Mavis and now you."\n\n \n\n  Johnny had gotten up in the night to use the bathroom and had\n\nheard his mother and her husband shouting at each other.\n\n\nHarry had said.\n " Him is mi son and him have every right to live wid di rest\n\nof di family,"  his mother had shot back. \n\n  " Why doesn\'t my Daddy like you guys living here?"\n\n Joey asked. \n\n \n\n" Hurry up, you guys.\n Yuh madda having a fit downstairs.\n\n\n \n Joey kissed her on the cheek.\n " Mi\n\nhear wah Joey say to you lickle while.\n Don\'t be upset, him jus a

sister, son and daughter.\n Is a big responsibility to tek care of so many people.\n Grant you, mi is only here on di weekends because mi have a live-in\n\njob.\n Sheba go to school full-time.\n It

Anyway, what seh we go get some breakfast?\n Give Auntie a big hug and nuh worry bout nutten.\n\n\n  After Doris and her family left for church, Mavis sat in the\n\nkitchen sipping a cup of coffee.\n She put her mind to her conversation with Johnny.\n Since she had been living in Toronto, some five years now, she had\n\nbeen trying to straighten out her life.\n She had known that it was going to be difficult, but she hadn\'t\n\nexpected it would take so long.\n For the first time, however, it seemed that she was finally going to\n\nachieve her dreams.\n Months ago, when she heard about the Canadian government\'s amnesty\n\nprogram for illegal immigrants, she had immediately applied for amnesty\n\nthrough an immigration consultant.\n She prayed day and night for a letter to come from the government,\n\ninforming her that she had been granted landed status. \n\n  Mavis sighed as she got up to wash the cup she had been using.\n She yearned to see her children again.\n As she looked around the house, she hoped that one day she too would\n\nhave the security of a good home, with a husband and children.\n She did not envy Doris, but she too had worked very hard to achieve\n\nsimilar status.\n\n\n  The next morning, Johnny admired his new clothes in the mirror.\n Dark brown pants, beige shirt and matching socks.\n The tight shoes he had worn up from Jamaica were replaced with ones\n\nthat were comfortable but stylish.\n As he combed his hair, he smiled and thought, if only Boysie and di\n\nodders could see mi now. \n\n  Today was the first day of school and he was scared.\n As he walked the short distance to school, his heart thumped.\n Only three days ago he and Boysie and the others had been sitting in\n\nthe Carib Theatre, enjoying one of their favourite movies,  " The\n\nGood, the Bad and the Ugly." </quote >\n Now he was in a different city, in a different country, surrounded by\n\na different kind of people. \n\n  He felt a lump in his throat as he opened the door to the English\n\nclass.\n The teacher and students stared at him as he entered the room.\n Looking around the sea of white faces, Johnny spotted a seat in a\n\ncorner.\n As he slunk toward the chair, he felt himself sweat.\n The teacher gave what was meant to be a reassuring smile and said,\n\n " It looks like we\'ve got a new student, class.\n\n\n  Johnny replied huskily.\n\n\n\n  Hearing his unfamiliar accent, the students looked at him\n\ncuriously.\n Johnny slumped in his chair, hoping to avoid his teacher\'s eyes.\n\n\n\n  " I\'m Mr. McClear.\n Johnny, are you familiar with the works of Shakespeare?\n\n He stared at Johnny without blinking.\n\n His tone indicated that he was stating a fact not asking a question.\n\n\n  " Yes, sah.\n I\'m from Jamaica.\n\n\nHamlet  .\n\n\n  The rest was lost in the sound of the bell and the rush of\n\nstudents toward the door.\n The teacher\'s voice rose faintly above the noise, reminding them of\n\ntomorrow\'s assignment.\n he said, handing Johnny a photocopied\n\npage.\n " Take this.\n\n Picking up his books and papers he left a puzzled Johnny scanning a\n\nlist of questions.\n Johnny left the classroom, half-stumbling his way down the corridor\n\nas other students brushed past him, hurrying to reach the next class on time.\n\n\n\n  Several months later Johnny sat in the school yard watching\n\nother students play baseball.\n If he had been back home in Jamaica he would have tried to make a\n\npass at the Black girl going by, but today he pretended not to notice her.\n\n\n  " Hi, my name\'s Marsha.\n\n\n \n\n  Marsha asked,\n\nsmiling down at him. \n\n  " Sure.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  " You seem so far away.\n\n\n  " Just tinking bout Jamaica and di nice time mi use to\n\nhave dere."  \n\n  " You can have a nice time here too.\n Wait till you start making friends and going places.\n You\'re just having culture shock.\n Happens to all of us when we first come.\n Ten years ago, I felt exactly like you, but now I like Toronto a\n\nlot."  \n\n  " Ah meet frens, but is not di same.\n Is not just di difference in di country or di people.\n Is more dan dat.\n Yuh see, mi grow wid Granny and mi cousins in Jamaica.\n\n\n \n\n  " Very much.\n Is di first time in twelve years mi see mi madda.\n Living wid her and her husband is not di same as living wid Granny\n\nand di others.\n Mi know Mama is trying her best to mek me feel at home, but mi is\n\nnot use to her.\n Mi try to be frenly to Karen and Joey but dem just ignore me.\n\n\n  " Come on, Johnny, don\'t say that.\n\n\n  " Him give me a whole heap of work while Joey and Karen\n\nwatch TV all day.\n If yuh only know.\n Di only person mi can talk to is mi big sistah, Sheba.\n She\'s studying daycare at Ryerson.\n She use to live wid us, but now dat she have her own apartment ah\n\nhardly see her.\n Aunt Mavis seems to understand what mi goin through.\n Mi like talking to her.\n She really nice, but she has two jobs, so she hardly ever home."\n\n \n\n \n\n  " Ah can\'t mek head nor tail of di school work.\n It seems so different from di work in Jamaica.\n And every time ah open mi mout di white kids stare at me.\n Sometimes ah know di answer to a question but mi fraid fi open mi\n\nmout."  \n\n  " I know what you mean.\n You\'ve got to ask the teacher to explain the stuff to you after\n\nclass.\n What I don\'t like is when the white kids tease us and call us\n\nnames."  \n\n \n\n  " Oh yeah.\n Now it\'s not so bad, but when I first came here it was awful.\n They called us names like " " nigger" " and\n\n" " chocolate face."

{'text': 'Early morning.\n Mist settled in the abandoned gully project littered with corrugated\n\nzinc, discarded tires and heaps of marl.\n Scavengers would soon be out, scraping whatever they could from the\n\ncity\'s refuse, fighting John Crows and herds of wandering pigs for anything\n\nedible under the rubble.\n The lone sound of a transistor radio bleated beyond the gurgle of the\n\nriver coursing its way through the sleeping lives of August Town.\n\n\n  Glen Harding stood by the window staring at the wet brightness of\n\nthe morning reflected off the asphalt road.\n He was sitting on his favorite chair in a corner of the living room,\n\nhis shirt tails hanging limply between his legs.\n The shirt fitted him tightly, his clothes felt as if they belonged to\n\nsomeone else; his trousers were held by a piece of cord, his jacket was at\n\nleast two sizes smaller, even his slippers seemed like a grotesque\n\ncaricature.\n He was not used to being so big.\n Five years ago on his twenty-ninth birthday, Sandra, his wife, had\n\nput him on a diet of vegetables and greens.\n Not that Glen minded, he should have been a vegetarian anyway,\n\nkeeping strictly Ital, for he was a Rastaman from the tribe of Naphtali, but\n\ncould not resist, every now and then, indulging in some curried goat, stewed\n\nbeef or even jerk chicken.\n But never jerk pork.\n He had never slipped that far.\n Glen rose and began pacing the room \x13 tall and broad-shouldered with\n\na full beard, his movements betrayed his exhaustion. \n\n  He tapped himself just below his rib cage.\n The tenderness was gone.\n The doctors had told him this was all to be expected.\n Matching a liver donor and recipient in the short time they had was a\n\nmiracle, and with the added trauma of the bullet wounds he\'d received, he was\n\nlucky to be alive.\n Lucky to be alive.\n What did the words mean?\n\n\n  He couldn\'t wait for the morning to come.\n He\'d been waiting three weeks for his friend, Duffus, to return from\n\nthe States, and he\'d gotten word that he was coming to see him today.\n Across the room, he could hear his Sandra\'s breathing.\n She was so delicate.\n She had a narrow waist, long legs, a thin face, black hair and eyes\n\nso black, you could see your reflection in them.\n Sandra shifted and stretched her hands over her head.\n\n\n  she said as she\n\nsearched for her glasses. \n\n  night.\n Evry time me head lick de pilla, me start dream de same dream.\n I doan tink I get a ounce a sleep.\n So me jus kotch here by de window and watch yu and David.\n\n\n  " Me tink so meself.\n De tea Miss Prince give him reely work good.\n I guwane put on some hot water to make some fa him dis mornin.\n\n\n \n\n  Sandra rose from the bed and stumbled into the kitchen.\n He watched her as she got up, her breasts barely showing through the\n\ncotton nightdress.\n She picked up a toy truck David had left on the floor and turned to\n\nGlen. \n\n \n\n \n\n  " I can always tell, yu always get quietlike.\n Glen, believe me yu cudn do a ting.\n It was six a dem to two of you.\n\n\n  Glen put his finger over the wound in his side.\n Everything had healed; there was no pain.\n But he was still having trouble in the mornings.\n Sometimes, he vomited blood.\n He pulled down his shirt, for he knew the sight of his bullet-scarred\n\nbody made Sandra uneasy. \n\n \n\nbrekfas\'  , "  he said. \n\n  Glen walked quietly into the room and sat on the side of the bed.\n He gently rocked the child, but David was fast asleep.\n Him get dis from him mother, thought Glen.\n Her family could sleep through a hurricane without moving, whereas\n\none drop of rain on the zinc roof would cause Glen to stir from his bed. \n\n \n Glen stroked his hair, ran his fingers along his nape and down the\n\nfront of his shirt.\n\n\n  The boy rubbed his eyes, yawned, and held out his arms to be\n\nhugged.\n Glen hugged him and kissed him on the forehead.\n David was a handsome boy who had inherited his mother\'s good looks\n\nand intense eyes.\n\n\n \n\n  " Mornin, sah.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  David frowned, shook his head sideways, and broke into a smile.\n Glen rubbed his palm over his forehead and they laughed together.\n\n\n\n  " Yu guwane grow up worthless if yu doan go to school, yu\n\nknow that?\n Come and wash yu face, an I we help yu get dress.\n\n\n  David went into the bathroom.\n He was still rubbing his eyes.\n\n\n  " Is what de two of yu was laughin bout in dere?"\n\n asked Sandra. \n\n \n\n \n\n  " Jus de tings a neva tell him before, cause I been

shocked her.\n\n\n \n\n  " Glen, I believe yu, I trus yu.\n Is jus that I fraid.\n Look how dem shoot yu up, look how much trouble we go through.\n Lord, Glen, I know tings rough, but we can mek it.\n As soon as yu get betta, yu can do anyting yu want except de\n\nbusiness, I beg yu."  \n\n  Glen held her by the shoulders and massaged the back of her\n\nneck.\n She made a stuttering sound as if she were about to cry.\n Glen tried to comfort her.\n He\'d been truthful about everything, except Duffus.\n He hadn\'t told her that he was coming to see him.\n He held Sandra close to his body, turned her around, and kissed her.\n\n\n\n  she\n\nsaid as she held his waist and pulled away. \n\n  Glen returned to the room and found David struggling with the\n\nzipper on his pants. \n\n  " Hold it there, boy!\n\n\n \n\n  " Neva mine.\n\n\n  He helped David tuck his shirt in his pants, and zipped up his\n\npants.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  " What I tell yu bout leavin yu belt inside the livin\n\nroom?\n Yu want people to tink is pure boogoyaga live in dis house?"\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Glen helped him with his shoes and socks, all the time looking\n\nat how tall he\'d grown, glowing with admiration as if it were the last time\n\nthat he was going to see him.\n\n\n  guwane coal if yu\n\ndoan come now."  \n\n  Father led by son, marched into the living room and stood by the\n\ntiny area reserved for eating. \n\n  " Reporting for mess as ordered, Sergeant Maam,"\n\n said Glen.\n\n\n  " The two of yu betta sit down before a Sergeant Maam de\n\ntwo of yu."  \n\n  Glen sat in his chair and drank his coffee.\n He watched Sandra as she served David his tea, and hard dough bread;\n\nthe butter was spread thinly over the slice.\n\n\n \n\n  He smiled while David continued to eat his breakfast, oblivious\n\nto what was going on, chewing each mouthful carefully, savoring the taste of\n\nthe butter. \n\n  .\n said Sandra as she loosened the\n\ntassels on the front of her nightdress.\n It was the same gown she had worn since she had been nursing David.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  Sandra smiled and went inside the bedroom.\n Glen finished his coffee and went over to the front door.\n He opened it and looked outside.\n The early morning sun seared the edges of the shacks that bordered\n\nthe housing project where they lived. \n\n  Sandra and Glen lived on the outskirts of the ghetto.\n They had gotten the house because Glen knew Danny Forbes, the top\n\nranking henchman for the Member of Parliament in the area.\n They had known each other since high school.\n When Sandra became pregnant and Glen had to drop out of school to\n\nsupport her because her mother had thrown her out of the house, Glen worked\n\nwith Danny for awhile.\n He helped Danny steal and stuff a few ballot boxes, and other odd\n\njobs during the last election. \n\n  With the money, Glen made a down payment on one of the last few\n\ncompleted houses in the area which Danny had reserved for him.\n The contractor had run off to Miami leaving the scheme half\n\nfinished.\n Everyone knew how they\'d gotten the house, and there was a feeling\n\nof envy and growing hatred between those who had lived there all the time and\n\nstill lived in shacks and those who had received the concrete houses replete\n\nwith modern conveniences such as indoor plumbing.\n The shack dwellers banded together against the house dwellers.\n There was rarely any crossing into rival territory.\n Children who had gone to primary school together met only if their\n\nparents happened at the same time to be shopping downtown, or at Christmas or\n\nEaster when the Catholic brothers arranged a fair or passion play. \n\n  Ten months after he had been shot, the rector for Glen\'s old\n\nhigh school, St. George\'s, asked Glen to help him plan a barbecue for both\n\ncommunities.\n " We have to do it for the children, we have to save the\n\nchildren,"  he urged.\n It ended in a shootout, and a death threat against the rector.\n As each side became increasingly wary of each other, rumors\n\ncirculated about suspected cruelty, and torture of those who had crossed\n\nenemy lines.\n But there was an added element.\n Both had become competitors in the marijuana trade and were equally\n\nintent on keeping their share of the trade.\n There were no rules to the rivalry, a gun tucked in your waist was\n\nthe only protection.', 'subdomain': 'JAMAICA_W_ALL', 'source': 'ice_HELM', 'id': '94d179f7-da4e-459f-b3d3-cde4bd0154a6', 'added': '2023-09-21T17:44:51.521233+00:00', 'english_score':
